 AN ORDINANCE relating to City employment; amending Seattle Municipal Code Section 4.04.030 to create a trial service employee status for employees not covered by a collective bargaining agreement, and Section 4.04.220 to include such trial service employees in the City's layoff order; and ratifying and confirming prior acts.

 WHEREAS, Ordinance 122972 created a trial service period and associated reversion rights for employees not covered by a collective bargaining agreement, but did not amend the Seattle Municipal Code to include such employees in order of layoff; and

 WHEREAS, the layoff language for non-represented employees in the Seattle Municipal Code as currently written is not in alignment with language in existing collective bargaining agreements, creating a disparate application of layoff order between non- represented employees and employees covered by a collective bargaining agreement;

 NOW, THEREFORE,

 BE IT ORDAINED BY THE CITY OF SEATTLE AS FOLLOWS:

 Section 1. The Seattle Municipal Code Section 4.04.030 shall be amended as follows: SMC 4.04.030 Definitions.

 ***

37. "Trial Service Employee" means an employee serving a Trial Service Period/ Regular Subsequent Appointment as defined in 4.04.030 (38).

~~37.~~38. "Trial Service Period/Regular Subsequent Appointment" means a twelve (12) month trial period of employment of a regular employee beginning with the effective date of a subsequent, regular appointment from one classification to a different classification through promotion or transfer to a classification in which the employee has not successfully completed a probationary or trial service period or rehire from a Reinstatement Recall List to a department other than that from which the employee was laid off.

 Section 2. The Seattle Municipal Code Section 4.04.220 shall be amended as follows:

 SMC 4.04.220 - Layoff

 A. Order of Layoff. Within an employing unit, the order for layoff in a given class shall be as follows:

 1. Probationary employees;

2. Trial service employees;

~~2.~~3. Regular employees;

 Provided, that temporary workers and interim employees shall be separated prior to the layoff of any probationary or trial service employee s in the same employing unit and class. Trial service employees who cannot be reverted in accordance with SMC 4.04.300(B) shall be separated prior to the layoff of any regular employees.

 Among regular employees, order of layoff shall be in order of seniority until a performance evaluation system as contemplated by this chapter is in effect. Thereafter, the regular employee having the lowest performance evaluation in the class shall be laid off first, but among employees whose performance is substantially the same, layoff shall be in the order of seniority.

 In the event one (1) or more positions having different budget and class titles or having budget titles only and no class titles are scheduled to be abrogated for any reason and such abrogation will result in a layoff, the Director shall establish an order of layoff for regular employees that reflects their relative seniority in positions with the same budget title as such positions affected by the layoff.

 ***

 C. Employee Options For Transfers to Avoid Layoff (Bumping). Insofar as the option is available, as determined by the Director, any regular employee subject to being laid off may displace within the same employing unit the employee who has the least seniority in the displacing employee's class, or if the order of layoff reflects seniority within a budget title pursuant to SMC Section 4.04.220 A above, in the displacing employee's budget title.

 The least-senior regular employee or a trial service employee who cannot be reverted in accordance with SMC 4.04.300(B) who is laid off or is displaced pursuant to the immediately preceding paragraph may displace the employee having the least seniority in the next lower class in a class series, or next lower budget title when (1) the displacing employee has had an appointment to such lower class or budget title, and (2) the employee to be sequentially displaced has less seniority than the displacing employee.

 ***

 E. Notice of Layoff.

 Where a regular employee or a trial service employee is separated by reason of layoff, when possible, thirty (30) days' prior written notice shall be given the affected employee, and at least fifteen (15) days' prior written notice shall be given unless:

 ***

 Section 3. To the extent that provisions of this ordinance pertain to terms and conditions of employment that are subject to collective bargaining, such provisions do not supersede the collective bargaining agreements or the right of the collective bargaining agents to bargain over the terms and conditions of employment.

 Section 4. Any acts made consistent with the authority of this ordinance taken after its passage and prior to the effective date are hereby ratified and confirmed.

 Section 5. This ordinance shall take effect and be in force thirty (30) days from and after its approval by the Mayor, but if not approved and returned by the Mayor within ten (10) days after presentation, it shall take effect as provided by Municipal Code Section 1.04.020.
