 CHAPTER 1

 ADMINISTRATION

 SECTION R101

 TITLE, SCOPE AND PURPOSE

 R101.1 Title. This subtitle shall be known as the "Seattle Residential Code" and may be so cited, and is referred to herein as "this code."

 R101.2 Scope. The provisions of this code apply to the construction, alteration, moving, demolition, repair and occupancy of detached one- and two-family dwellings and townhouses not more than three stories above grade plane in height with a separate means of egress, and their accessory structures, including adult family homes, foster family care homes and family day care homes licensed by the Washington State Department of Social and Health Services.

 Exception: Live/work units complying with the requirements of Section 419 of the International Building Code shall be permitted to be built as one- and two-family dwellings or townhouses. Fire suppression shall conform to Section 419 of the International Building Code.

 Note: The seismic design for wood-frame buildings with more than two stories above grade shall comply with the International Building Code or other standards referenced in Section R301.1. See Sections R301.2.2.3 and Table R602.10.1.2(2).

 Interpretation R101.2a: Buildings with mixed occupancies, other than residences with home occupations, are not within the scope of the Seattle Residential Code and shall comply with the Seattle Building Code.

 Interpretation R101.2b: Three or more dwellings located above a common garage or other common space are required to comply with the Seattle Building Code. Units in detached one- and two-family dwellings may share common space.

 R101.3 Applicability of Seattle Residential Code. A building permit application shall be considered under the Seattle Residential and Energy codes in effect on the date a valid and fully complete building permit application is submitted or on a date as otherwise required by law.

 R101.3.1 Fully complete building permit applications. A building permit application is complete if the building official determines it meets the requirements of Sections R105.5.1 through R105.5.2.5, and the application includes the construction documents for the architectural and structural components of the building. In order for the application to be deemed complete in cases when the building official allows an application for only a portion of a building, the application shall include the structural frame for the entire building.

 R101.4 Purpose. The purpose of this code is to provide minimum standards to safeguard life or limb, health, property and public welfare by regulating and controlling the design, construction, quality of materials, occupancy, location and maintenance of buildings and structures within the City and certain equipment specifically regulated herein. The purpose of this code is to provide for and promote the health, safety and welfare of the general public, and not to create or otherwise establish or designate any particular class or group of persons who will or should be especially protected or benefitted by the terms of this code.

 R101.5 Internal consistency. Where in any specific case, different sections of this code specify different materials, methods of construction or other requirements, the most restrictive governs. Where there is a conflict between a general requirement and a specific requirement, the specific requirement is applicable.

 R101.6 Referenced codes and standards. The codes and standards referenced in this code are considered part of this code to the extent prescribed by each such reference. Where differences occur between provisions of this code and referenced codes and standards, the provisions of this code apply, except that nothing in this Code limits the effect of any provision of the Grading Code, Stormwater and Drainage Control Code, or Regulations for Environmentally Critical Areas.

 Exception: Where enforcement of a code provision would violate the conditions of the listing of the equipment or appliance, the conditions of the listing and manufacturer's instructions apply.

 R101.7 Appendices. Provisions in the International Residential Code appendices do not apply unless specifically adopted.

 R101.8 Metric units. Wherever in this code there is a conflict between metric units of measurement and U.S. customary units, the U.S. customary units govern.

 SECTION R102

 UNSAFE BUILDINGS, STRUCTURES OR PREMISES

 R102.1 Emergency orders. Whenever the building official finds that any building, structure or premises, or portion thereof, is in such a dangerous and unsafe condition as to constitute an imminent hazard to life or limb, the building official may issue an emergency order directing that the building, structure or premises, or portion thereof be restored to a safe condition by a date certain. The order may also require that the building, structure or premises, or portion thereof, be vacated within a reasonable time to be specified in the order. In the case of extreme danger, the order may specify immediate vacation of the building, structure or premises, or may authorize immediate disconnection of the utilities or energy source.

 R102.1.1 Service of emergency order. The order shall be posted on the premises or personally served on the owner of the building or premises or any person responsible for the condition. The order shall specify the time for compliance.

No person may occupy a building, structure or premises, or portion thereof, after the date on which the building is required to be vacated until the building, structure or premises, or portion thereof, is restored to a safe condition as required by the order and this code. It is a violation for any person to fail to comply with an emergency order issued by the building official.

 R102.2 Hazard correction order. Whenever the building official finds that an unsafe building, structure or premises exists, the building official may issue a hazard correction order specifying the conditions causing the building, structure or premises to be unsafe and directing the owner or other person responsible for the unsafe building, structure or premises to correct the condition by a date certain. In lieu of correction, the owner may submit a report or analysis to the building official analyzing said conditions and establishing that the building, structure or premises is, in fact, safe. The building official may require that the report or analysis be prepared by a licensed engineer and may require compliance with International Building Code Chapter 34.

 R102.2.1 Service of hazard correction order. The order shall be posted on the premises or personally served on the owner of the building or premises or any person responsible for the condition and shall specify the time for compliance.

 R102.2.2 Effect of hazard correction order. It is a violation for any person to fail to comply with a hazard correction order as specified in this subsection.

 R103.3 Stop work orders. The building official may issue a stop work order whenever any work is being done contrary to the provisions of this code, or in the event of dangerous or unsafe conditions related to construction or demolition. The stop work order shall identify the violation and may prohibit work or other activity on the site.

 R103.3.1 Service of stop work order. The building official may serve the stop work order by posting it in a conspicuous place at the site, if posting is physically possible. If posting is not physically possible, then the stop work order may be served in the manner set forth in the Revised Code of Washington (RCW) 4.28.080 for service of a summons or by sending it by first class mail to the last known address of: the property owner, the person doing or causing the work to be done, or the holder of a permit if work is being stopped on a permit. For purposes of this section, service is complete at the time of posting or of personal service, or if mailed, three days after the date of mailing. When the last day of the period so computed is a Saturday, Sunday or city holiday, the period runs until 5 p.m. on the next business day.

 R103.3.2 Effective date of stop work order. Stop work orders are effective when posted, or if posting is not physically possible, when one of the persons identified in Section R103.3.1 is served or, if notice is mailed, three days after the date of mailing.

 R103.3.3.1 Request for review. Any person aggrieved by a stop work order may obtain a review of the order by delivering to the building official a request in writing within two business days of the date of service of the stop work order.

 R103.3.3.2 Review procedure. The review shall occur within two business days after receipt by the building official of the request for review unless the requestor agrees to a longer time. Any person affected by the stop work order may submit additional information to the building official for consideration as part of the review at any time prior to the review. The review will be made by a representative of the building official who will review all additional information received and may conduct a site visit.

 R103.3.3.3 Decision. After the review, the building official may:

 a. Sustain the stop work order;

 b. Withdraw the stop work order;

 c. Amend the stop work order; or

 d. Continue the review to a date certain.

The building official shall issue an order of the building official containing the decision within two business days after the review and shall cause the order to be sent by first class mail to the person or persons requesting the review, any person on whom the stop work order was served, and any other person who requested a copy before issuance of the order.

 R103.4 Occupancy violations. Whenever any building or structure is being occupied contrary to the provisions of this code, the building official may order such occupancy discontinued and the building or structure, or portion thereof, vacated by notice.

 R103.4.1 Service of notice of occupancy violation. The notice shall be served by personal service or regular first class mail addressed to the last known address of the occupant of the premises or any person causing such occupancy. If no address is available after reasonable inquiry, the notice may be served by posting it in a conspicuous place on the premises.

 R103.4.2 Compliance with notice of occupancy violation. Any person occupying the building or structure shall discontinue the occupancy by the date specified in the notice of the building official, or shall make the building or structure, or portion thereof, comply with the requirements of this code; provided, however, that in the event of an unsafe building, Section 102 may apply.

 R103.5 Civil penalties. Any person violating or failing to comply with the provisions of this code shall be subject to a cumulative civil penalty in an amount not to exceed $500 per day for each violation from the date the violation occurs or begins until compliance is achieved. In cases where the building official has issued a notice of violation, the violation will be deemed to begin, for purposes of determining the number of days of violation, on the date compliance is required by the notice of violation.

 R103.6 Enforcement in Municipal Court. Civil actions to enforce this chapter shall be brought exclusively in Seattle Municipal Court, except as otherwise required by law or court rule. In any civil action for a penalty, the City has the burden of proving by a preponderance of the evidence that a violation exists or existed; the issuance of the notice of violation or of an order following a review by the building official is not itself evidence that a violation exists.

 R103.7 Judicial review. Because civil actions to enforce Seattle Municipal Code (SMC) Title 22 must be brought exclusively in Seattle Municipal Court pursuant to Section R103.6, orders of the building official including notices of violation issued under this chapter are not subject to judicial review pursuant to Chapter 36.70C RCW.

 R103.8 Alternative criminal penalty. Anyone who violates or fails to comply with any notice of violation or order issued by the building official pursuant to this code or who removes, mutilates, destroys or conceals a notice issued or posted by the building official shall, upon conviction thereof, be punished by a fine of not more than $5000 or by imprisonment for not more than 365 days, or by both such fine and imprisonment for each separate violation. Each day's violation shall constitute a separate offense.

 R103.9 Additional relief. The building official may seek legal or equitable relief to enjoin any acts or practices and abate any condition when necessary to achieve compliance.

 R103.10 Administrative Review.

 R103.10.1 Administrative review by the building official. Applicants may request administrative review by the building official of decisions or actions pertaining to the administration and enforcement of this code. Requests shall be addressed to the building official.

 R103.10.2 Administrative review by the Construction Codes Advisory Board. Applicants may request review of decisions or actions pertaining to the application and interpretation of this code by the Construction Codes Advisory Board (CCAB), except for stop work orders, notices of violations and revocations of permits. The review will be performed by a panel of three or more members of the Construction Codes Advisory Board, chosen by the Board Chair. The Chair shall consider the subject of the review and members' expertise when selecting members to conduct a review. The decision of the review panel is advisory only; the final decision is made by the building official.

 R103.11 Recording of notices. The building official may record a copy of any order or notice with the Department of Records and Elections of King County

 R103.12 Appeal to Superior Court. Final decisions of the Seattle Municipal Court on enforcement actions authorized by Title 22 may be appealed pursuant to the Rules for Appeal of Decisions of Courts of Limited Jurisdiction.

 Section 19. The provisions of this ordinance are declared to be separate and severable. The invalidity of any clause, sentence, paragraph, subdivision, section or portion of this ordinance, or the invalidity of the application thereof to any person, owner, or circumstance shall not affect the validity of the remainder of this ordinance, or the validity of its application to other persons, owners, or circumstances.

 Section 20. Sections 2 -15 of Ordinance 122533 are repealed and Sections 1-9 of Ordinance 122774 are repealed.

 Section 21. For a period of 60 days following the effective date of this ordinance, the Director may also accept and thereafter approve applications that are designed to comply with either the requirements of this Ordinance or the requirements of Ordinance 122533 as amended by Ordinance 122774.

 Section 22. The following findings of fact are adopted in accordance with Washington Administrative Code 51-04-030 in support of amendments to Section R107:

 * Seattle is a densely-occupied city with a very large number of existing buildings; much of the building construction activity in Seattle consists of altering existing buildings for reuse.

 * Flexibility in applying code provisions is necessary to accommodate the variety of buildings in Seattle that were constructed under codes dating as far back as the 1800s. The flexibility in Seattle's existing building provisions recognizes that standards that are reasonable for new construction are often infeasible for older buildings.

 * Seattle's existing building provisions result in safety improvements to buildings when strict adherence to all the code requirements would often result in older buildings not being reused and not being upgraded.

 * Seattle is a densely-developed city with high seismic risk:

 o Seattle has experienced three significant earthquakes in the past 60 years.

 o Seattle has a seismic fault located directly below areas that are liquefaction-prone, have large numbers of unreinforced masonry buildings, and are densely-populated and heavily-developed.

 o Seattle has experienced a greater rate of damage to buildings resulting from earthquakes than most other jurisdictions in Washington.

 * The International Codes do not require seismic upgrades of existing buildings- --Seattle codes' substantial alteration provisions require upgrades of unaltered portions of buildings. The upgrades are not required to conform to the standards for new construction because such standards are often infeasible for older buildings, and Seattle codes' substantial alteration provisions are the most suitable provisions for Seattle's unique conditions.

 * The Building Code provisions have been in place in general form for many years, providing consistency for owners of buildings and helping them predict what rules will apply as they plan the future use of their buildings.

 * Seattle has expert staff with training, education, and experience to use judgment in applying the discretionary provisions.

 Section 23. The amendments to Section R107 of the International Residential Code, 2009 edition, contained in Section 2 of this ordinance shall take effect on the later of: 1) 30 days from and after their approval by the Mayor, but if not approved and returned by the Mayor within ten days after presentation, they shall take effect as provided by Seattle Municipal Code Section 1.04.020, or 2) the date of approval of these amendments by the State Building Code Council.

 Section 24. Except for Section R107 of the International Residential Code, this ordinance shall take effect and be in force 30 days from and after its approval by the Mayor, but if not approved and returned by the Mayor within ten days after presentation, it shall take effect as provided by Seattle Municipal Code Section 1.04.020.
