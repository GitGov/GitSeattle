 WHEREAS, the City of Seattle supports the sensitive development of vacant or non-contributing lots within the Pioneer Square Preservation District; and

 WHEREAS, the development of new structures provides an opportunity to ensure that new development is constructed in a sustainable manner, encouraging energy conservation and reducing the impacts of new development on the environment; and

 WHEREAS, common recreation areas on rooftops utilize building roofs, provide a unique opportunity to showcase sustainable features incorporated into new development, and are otherwise allowed in most downtown zones; and

 WHEREAS, common recreation areas that include renewable energy generation promote the health of our citizens and the environment; NOW, THEREFORE,

 Section 1. Section 23.66.140 of the Seattle Municipal Code, which section was last amended by Ordinance 120928, is amended as follows:

 B. Minimum Height. No structure shall be erected or permanent addition added to an existing structure which would result in the height of the new structure of less than fifty (50) feet. Height of the structure is to be measured from mean street level fronting on the property to the mean roofline of the structure.

 C. Rooftop Features and Additions to Structures.

 The height limits established for the rooftop features described in this subsection may be increased by the average height of the existing street parapet or a historically substantiated reconstructed parapet on the building on which the rooftop feature is proposed. The setbacks required for rooftop features may be modified by the Department of Neighborhoods Director, after a sight line review by the Preservation Board to ensure that the features are minimally visible from public streets and parks within three hundred (300) feet of the structure.

 1. Religious symbols for religious institutions, smokestacks and flagpoles may extend up to fifty (50) feet above the roof of the structure or the maximum height limit, whichever is less, except as regulated in Chapter 23.64 of this Land Use Code, provided that they are a minimum of ten (10) feet from all lot lines.

 2. For existing structures,~~O~~open railings, planters, clerestories, skylights, play equipment, parapets and firewalls may extend up to four (4) feet above the roof of the structure or the maximum height limit, whichever is less.~~, with unlimited rooftop coverage.~~For new structures, such features may extend up to four (4) feet above the maximum height limit. No rooftop coverage limits apply to such features regardless of whether the structure is existing or new.

 3. Solar collectors, excluding greenhouses, may extend up to seven (7) feet above the roof of the structure or maximum height limit, whichever is less, with unlimited rooftop coverage, provided they are a minimum of ten (10) feet from all lot lines. For new structures, solar collectors may extend up to seven (7) feet above the maximum height limit, except as provided in 10(a) of this section, and provided that they are a minimum of ten (10) feet from all lot lines.

4. The following rooftop features may extend up to eight (8) feet above the roof or maximum height limit, whichever is less, when they are set back a minimum of fifteen (15) feet from the street and three (3) feet from an alley. They may extend up to twelve (12) feet above the roof when set back a minimum of thirty (30) feet from the street. A setback may not be required at common wall lines subject to review by the Preservation Board and approval by the Department of Neighborhoods Director.

 b. Stair and elevator penthouses;

 c. Mechanical equipment;

 d. Minor communication utilities and accessory communication devices, except that height is regulated according to the provisions of Section 23.57.014.
