A. The purpose of this Land Use Code is to protect and promote public health, safety and general welfare through a set of regulations and procedures for the use of land which are consistent with and implement the City's Comprehensive Plan. Procedures are established to increase citizen awareness of land use activities and their impacts and to coordinate necessary review processes. The Land Use Code classifies land within the City into various land use zones and overlay districts ~~which~~in order to regulate ~~the~~ uses and ~~bulk of buildings and~~ structures. The provisions are designed to provide adequate light, air, access, and open space; conserve the natural environment and historic resources; maintain a compatible scale within an area; minimize traffic congestion and enhance the streetscape and pedestrian environment. They seek to achieve an efficient use of the land without major disruption of the natural environment and to direct development to ~~sites~~lots with adequate services and amenities.

B. Other regulations apply, such as but not limited to building and construction codes (SMC Title 22) and provisions for environmental review, critical areas, noise control, tree protection, and historic preservation (SMC Title 25).  C. All structures or uses shall be built or established on a lot or lots.

 D. A grant of a waiver, modification, departure, exception or variance from one specific development standard does not relieve the applicant from compliance with any other standard.

The preceding sentence does not apply if the environmentally critical area either 1) was created by human activity, or 2) is a designated peat settlement, liquefaction, seismic or volcanic hazard, or flood prone area, or abandoned landfill.

3. Other Criteria. The Midrise zone designation is most appropriate in areas generally characterized by the following:

~~a. Either:~~(1) Areas that are developed predominantly to the intensity permitted by the Midrise zone, or

 (2) Areas that are within an urban center, the village core of a hub urban village, or a residential urban village, where a neighborhood plan adopted or amended by the City Council after January 1, 1995 indicates that the area is appropriate for a Midrise zone designation;

a.~~b~~. Properties that are adjacent to business and commercial areas with comparable height and bulk;

~~c~~b. Properties in areas that are served by major arterials and where transit service is good to excellent and street capacity could absorb the traffic generated by midrise development;

~~d~~c. Properties in areas that are in close proximity to major employment centers;

~~e~~d. Properties in areas that are in close proximity to open space and recreational facilities;

~~f~~e. Properties in areas along arterials where topographic changes either provide an edge or permit a transition in scale with surroundings;

~~h~~g. Properties in areas with moderate slopes and views oblique or parallel to the slope where the height and bulk of existing structures have already limited or blocked views from within the multifamily area and upland areas;

~~i~~h. Properties in areas with steep slopes and views perpendicular to the slope where upland developments are of sufficient distance or height to retain their views over the area designated for the ~~sixty (60) foot height limit~~Midrise zone;

~~j~~i. Properties in areas where topographic conditions allow the bulk of the structure to be obscured. Generally, these are steep slopes, ~~sixteen (16)~~16 percent or more, with views perpendicular to the slope.

 Section 3. Subsection B of Section 23.34.028 of the Seattle Municipal Code, which section was last amended by Ordinance 118794, is amended as follows:

The preceding sentence does not apply if the environmentally critical area either 1) was created by human activity, or 2) is a designated peat settlement, liquefaction, seismic or volcanic hazard, or flood prone area, or abandoned landfill.

 3. Other Criteria. The Highrise zone designation is most appropriate in areas generally characterized by the following:

~~a. Either:~~(1) Areas that are developed predominantly to the intensity permitted by the Highrise zone, or

 (2) Areas that are within an urban center or the village core of a hub urban village, or a residential urban village, where a neighborhood plan adopted or amended by the City Council after January 1, 1995 indicates that the area is appropriate for a Highrise zone designation;

~~b~~a. Properties in areas that are served by arterials where transit service is good to excellent and street capacity is sufficient to accommodate traffic generated by highrise development;

~~c~~b. Properties in areas that are adjacent to a concentration of residential services or a major employment center;

 B. In authorizing a conditional use, the Director or City Council may impose conditions to mitigate adverse impacts on the public interest and other properties in the zone or vicinity.  C. The Director may deny or recommend denial of a conditional use if the Director determines that adverse impacts cannot be mitigated satisfactorily, or that the proposed use is materially detrimental to the public welfare or injurious to property in the zone or vicinity in which the property is located.

~~B~~D. A use that was legally established but that is now permitted only as a conditional use is not a nonconforming use and ~~shall~~will be regulated as if a conditional use approval had earlier been granted.  E. Any authorized conditional use that has been discontinued may not be re-established or recommenced except pursuant to a new conditional use permit. The following will constitute conclusive evidence that the conditional use has been discontinued:

 1. A permit to change the use of the lot has been issued and the new use has been established; or

 2. The lot has not been used for the purpose authorized by the conditional use for more than 24 consecutive months.

 c. The limits in subsections ~~C~~E.5.a and ~~C~~E.5.b of this Section 23.51B.002 may be waived by the Director as a Type I decision when a waiver would contribute to reduced demolition of residential structures.

~~D.~~F. Structure Width.

 1. When a new public school structure is built on a new public school site or on an existing public school site, the maximum width of a structure ~~shall be~~is~~sixty-six (66)~~66 feet unless either the modulation option in subsection ~~D1a~~F.1.a below or the landscape option in subsection ~~D1b~~23.51B.002.F.1.b  below is met.

 a. Modulation Option. Facades shall be modulated according to the following provisions:

~~(~~1) The minimum depth of modulation ~~shall be~~is~~four (4)~~4 feet.

~~(~~2) The minimum width of modulation ~~shall be~~is~~twenty (20)~~20 percent of the total structure width or ~~ten (10)~~10 feet, whichever is greater.

 b. Landscape Option. The yards provided by the required setbacks shall be landscaped as follows:

~~(~~1) One ~~(1)~~ tree and three ~~(3)~~ shrubs are required for each ~~three hundred (300)~~300 square feet of required yard. ~~When new trees are planted, at least half must be deciduous.~~

~~(~~2) Trees and shrubs ~~which~~that already exist in the required planting area or have their trunk or center within ~~ten (10)~~10 feet of the area may be substituted for required plantings on a ~~one (1) tree to one (1) tree or one (1) shrub to one (1) shrub basis if the minimum standards of the Director's Rule for Landscaping, are met, except that shrub height need not exceed two (2) feet at any time. In order to give credit for large existing trees, a tree may count as one (1) required tree for every three hundred (300) square feet of its canopy spread.~~one-tree-to-one-tree or one-shrub- to-one-shrub basis. In order to qualify, a tree must be 6 inches or greater in diameter, measured 4.5 feet above the ground.

~~23.44.036 Public facilities.~~Chapter 23.51A Public facilities in residential zones  23.51A.002 Public facilities in single family zones

A. Except as provided in subsections B, D and E ~~below~~of this Section 23.51A.002, uses in public facilities that are most similar to uses permitted outright or permitted as an administrative conditional use under ~~this chapter shall also be~~Chapter 23.44 are also permitted outright or as an administrative conditional use, subject to the same use regulations, development standards and administrative conditional use criteria that govern the similar use. The City Council may waive or modify applicable development standards or administrative conditional use criteria according to the provisions of Chapter 23.76, Subchapter III, Council Land Use Decisions, with public projects considered as Type IV quasi-judicial decisions and City facilities considered as Type V legislative decisions.

 B. Permitted Uses in Public Facilities Requiring City Council Approval. The following uses in public facilities in single-family zones may be permitted by the City Council, according to the provisions of Chapter 23.76, Procedures for Master Use Permits and Council Land Use Decisions:

 1. Police precinct station;

 2. Fire station;

 3. Public boat moorage;

 4. Utility services use; and

 5. Other similar use.

 The proponent of any such use shall demonstrate the existence of a public necessity for the public facility use in a single-family zone. The public facility use shall be developed according to the development standards for institutions (Section 23.44.022), unless the City Council makes a determination to waive or modify applicable development standards according to the provisions of Chapter 23.76, Subchapter III, Council Land Use Decisions, with public projects considered as Type IV quasi-judicial decisions and City facilities considered as ~~type~~Type V legislative decisions.

 C. Expansion of Uses in Public Facilities.

 1. Major Expansion. Major expansions may be permitted to uses in public facilities allowed in subsections 23.51A.002.A and B above according to the same provisions and procedural requirements as described in these subsections. A major expansion of a public facility use occurs when the proposed expansion ~~that is proposed~~ would not meet development standards or would exceed either ~~seven hundred fifty (750)~~750 square feet or ~~ten (10)~~10 percent of its existing area, whichever is greater, including gross floor area and areas devoted to active outdoor uses other than parking.

 2. Minor Expansion. When an expansion falls below the major expansion threshold level, it is a minor expansion. Minor expansions may be permitted to uses in public facilities allowed in subsections  23.51A.002.A and B above according to the provisions of Chapter 23.76, Procedures for Master Use Permits and Council Land Use Decisions, for a Type I Master Use Permit when the development standards of the zone in which the public facility is located are met.

 D. Sewage Treatment Plants. The expansion or reconfiguration (which term shall include reconstruction, redevelopment, relocation on the site, or intensification of treatment capacity) of existing sewage treatment plants in single-family zones may be permitted if there is no feasible alternative location in a zone where the use is permitted and the conditions imposed under subsections 23.51A.002.D.3 and D4 are met.

 1. Applicable Procedures. The decision on an application for the expansion or reconfiguration of a sewage treatment plant ~~shall be~~is a Type IV Council land use decision. If an application for an early determination of feasibility is required to be filed pursuant to subsection D2 of this section 23.51A.002, the early determination of feasibility will also be a Council land use decision subject to Sections 23.76.038 through 23.76.056.

 2. Need for Feasible Alternative Determination. The proponent shall demonstrate that there is no feasible alternative location in a zone where establishment of the use is permitted.

 a. The Council's decision as to the feasibility of alternative location(s) shall be based upon a full consideration of the environmental, social and economic impacts on the community, and the intent to preserve and to protect the physical character of single-family areas, and to protect single-family areas from intrusions of non-single- family uses.

 b. The determination of feasibility may be the subject of a separate application for a Council land use decision prior to submission of an application for a project-specific approval if the Director determines that the expansion or reconfiguration proposal is complex, involves the phasing of programmatic and project-specific decisions or affects more than one site in a single-family zone.

 c. Application for an early determination of feasibility shall include:

~~(~~1) The scope and intent of the proposed project in the single-family zone and appropriate alternative(s) in zones where establishment of the use is permitted, identified by the applicant or the Director;

~~(~~2) The necessary environmental documentation as determined by the Director, including an assessment of the impacts of the proposed project and of the permitted-zone alternative(s), according to the state and local SEPA guidelines;

~~(~~3) Information on the overall sewage treatment system ~~which~~that outlines the interrelationship of facilities in single-family zones and in zones where establishment of the use is permitted;

~~(~~4) Schematic plans outlining dimensions, elevations, locations on site and similar specifications for the proposed project and for the alternative(s).

 d. If a proposal or any portion of a proposal is also subject to a feasible or reasonable alternative location determination under Section 23.60.066 ~~of Title 23~~, the Plan Shoreline Permit application and the early determination application will be considered in one determination process.

 3. Conditions for Approval of Proposal.

 a. The project ~~shall be~~is located so that adverse impacts on residential areas ~~shall be~~are minimized;

 b. The expansion of a facility ~~shall~~does not result in a concentration of institutions or facilities that would create or appreciably aggravate impacts that are incompatible with single- family residences.

 c. A facility management and transportation plan ~~shall be~~is required. The level and kind of detail to be disclosed in the plan shall be based on the probable impacts and/or scale of the proposed facility, and shall at a minimum include discussion of sludge transportation, noise control, and hours of operation. Increased traffic and parking expected to occur with use of the facility shall not create a serious safety problem or a blighting influence on the neighborhood;

 d. Measures to minimize potential odor emission and airborne pollutants including methane shall meet standards of and be consistent with best available technology as determined in consultation with the Puget Sound Clean Air Agency (PSCAA), and shall be incorporated into the design and operation of the facility;

 e. Methods of storing and transporting chlorine and other hazardous and potentially hazardous chemicals shall be determined in consultation with the Seattle Fire Department and incorporated into the design and operation of the facility;

 f. Vehicular access suitable for trucks is available or provided from the plant to a designated arterial improved to City standards;

 g. The bulk of facilities shall be compatible with the surrounding community. Public facilities that do not meet bulk requirements may be located in single-family residential areas if there is a public necessity for their location there;

 h. Landscaping and screening, separation from less intensive zones, noise, light and glare controls and other measures to ensure the compatibility of the use with the surrounding area and to mitigate adverse impacts shall be incorporated into the design and operation of the facility.

 i. No r~~R~~esidential structures, including those modified for nonresidential use, ~~shall not be~~are demolished for facility expansion unless a need has been demonstrated for the services of the institution or facility in the surrounding community.

 4. Substantial Conformance. If the application for a project- specific proposal is submitted after an early determination that location of the sewage treatment plant is not feasible in a zone where establishment of the use is permitted, the proposed project must be in substantial conformance with the feasibility determination.

 Substantial conformance shall include, but not be limited to, a determination that:

 a. There is no net substantial increase in the environmental impacts of the project-specific proposal as compared to the impacts of the proposal as approved in the feasibility determination.

 b. Conditions included in the feasibility determination are met.

 E. Prohibited Uses. The following public facilities are prohibited in single-family zones:

 1. Jails;

 2. Metro operating bases;

 3. Park and ride lots;

 4. Establishment of new sewage treatment plants;

 5. Solid waste transfer stations;

 6. Animal control shelters;

 7. Post Office distribution centers; and

 8. Work-release centers.

 F. Essential Public Facilities. Permitted essential public facilities shall also be reviewed according to the provisions of Chapter 23.80, Essential Public Facilities.

 1. In making its decision, the Council shall determine whether the facility serves the public interest. This determination shall be based on an evaluation of the public benefits and the adverse impacts of the facility. The Council shall approve the facility only if it finds that public benefits outweigh the adverse impacts of the facility which cannot otherwise be mitigated.

 2. In evaluating the public benefits and adverse impacts of a proposed convention center, the Council shall consider, but is not limited to, the following factors:

 a. Economic impacts including, but not limited to, the net fiscal impacts on The State of Washington and City of Seattle, increased employment opportunities, demand for new development and increased tourism in the City and state;

 b. Public amenities incorporated in the project including, but not limited to, open spaces accessible to the public and improved pedestrian circulation systems;

 c. The relationship of the project to its surroundings with respect to height, bulk, scale, massing, landscaping, aesthetics, view enhancement or blockage, shadows and glare;

The master use permit process shall be used to authorize these uses.~~B. Unless otherwise specified in this subchapter, conditional uses shall meet the development standards for uses permitted outright in Subchapter I.

 C. The Director may approve, condition or deny a conditional use. The Director's decision shall be based on a determination whether the proposed use meets the criteria for establishing a specific conditional use and whether the use will be materially detrimental to the public welfare or injurious to property in the zone or vicinity in which the property is located.

 D. In authorizing a conditional use, the Director may mitigate adverse negative impacts by imposing requirements and conditions deemed necessary for the protection of other properties in the zone or vicinity and the public interest.

 E. The Director shall issue written findings of fact and conclusions to support the Director's decision.

 F. Any authorized conditional use which has been discontinued shall not be reestablished or recommenced except pursuant to a new conditional use permit. The following shall constitute conclusive evidence that the conditional use has been discontinued:

~~1. A permit to change the use of the property has been issued and the new use has been established; or~~~~2. The property has not been devoted to the authorized conditional use for more than twenty-four (24) consecutive months.~~~~Property which is vacant, except for dead storage of materials or equipment of the conditional use, shall not be considered as being devoted to the authorized conditional use. The expiration of licenses necessary for the conditional use shall be evidence that the property is not being devoted to the conditional use. A conditional use in a multifamily structure or a multi-tenant commercial structure shall not be considered as discontinued unless all units are either vacant or devoted to another use.~~

A. Uses permitted as administrative conditional uses in Table A for 23.45.504, may be permitted by the Director when the provisions of Section 23.42.042 and this Section 23.45.506 are met.  B.

 Section 31. A new Section 23.45.516 of the Seattle Municipal Code is added as follows:

 23.45.516 Additional height and extra residential floor area in Midrise and Highrise zones

 A. General. Definitions in Section 23.58A.004 apply in this Section 23.45.516 unless otherwise specified. According to the provisions of this Section 23.45.516, Section 23.45.526, and Chapter 23.58A:

 1. In MR, MR/85, and HR zones, extra residential floor area may be permitted up to the maximum limits allowed by Section 23.45.510; and

 2. In MR and HR zones, additional height, above the base height limit, is permitted for structures that qualify for extra residential floor area, up to the maximum limits allowed by Sections 23.45.514.

 B. Eligible lots. The following lots are eligible for extra residential floor area and, except in MR/85 zones, additional height:

 1. Lots in MR or MR/85 zones in urban villages, urban centers and the Station Area Overlay District; and

 2. Lots in HR zones.

 C. Highrise Zones.

 1. Extra Residential Floor Area. In HR zones extra residential floor area may be gained in accordance with Chapter 23.58A subject to the conditions and limits in this Section 23.45.516. Up to all extra residential floor area may be gained through the affordable housing incentive program provisions in Section 23.58A.014. Up to 40 percent of extra residential floor area may be gained by one or any combination of:

 a. transfer of development potential;

 b. providing neighborhood open space or a payment in lieu thereof; and/or

 c. providing a neighborhood green street setback if allowed pursuant to subsection 23.45.516.F, all in accordance with this Section 23.45.516 and Chapter 23.58A.

 2. Structure Height.

 a. Structures 240 feet or less in height. The applicable height limit in an HR zone under subsection 23.45.514.A is 240 feet if the applicant satisfies the conditions for extra floor area but not all of the conditions in subsection C.2.b of this Section 23.45.516 are met.

 b. Structures over 240 feet. The applicable height limit in an HR zone under subsection 23.45.514.A is 300 feet if the applicant satisfies the conditions for extra floor area and the following additional conditions are met:

 1) For any structure above a height of 85 feet, the average residential gross floor area per story above a height of 45 feet does not exceed 9,500 square feet; and

 2) No parking is located at or above grade, unless it is separated from all street lot lines by another use; and

 3) At least 25 percent of the lot area at grade is one or more landscaped areas, each with a minimum horizontal dimension of 10 feet, or at least 20 percent of the lot area at grade is landscaped, common residential amenity area meeting the standards of 23.45.522.

 D. Transfer of Development Potential (TDP) from Landmark Structures and Open Space.

 1. Sending lots. TDP may be transferred under the provisions of Section 23.58A.018, as modified by this Section 23.45.516, only from landmark TDP sites and open space TDP sites. In order to be eligible as a landmark TDP site or open space TDP site, a lot must be located in the First Hill Urban Center Village and must be zoned MR or HR. Sending lots are subject to the limits and conditions in this Chapter 23.45 and Chapter 23.58A. The amount of TDP that may be transferred from a lot is limited to the amount by which the base FAR under Section 23.45.510 exceeds floor area on the lot that is not exempt under that Section.

 2. Receiving lots. Any lot located in an HR zone within the First Hill Urban Center Village is eligible for extra residential floor area according to the provisions of this Section 23.45.516 to receive TDP from an eligible sending lot, subject to the limits and conditions in this Chapter 23.45 and Chapter 23.58A.

 E. Combined lot development. When authorized by the Director pursuant to this Section 23.45.516, lots located on the same block in an HR zone may be combined, whether contiguous or not, solely for the purpose of allowing some or all of the capacity for chargeable floor area on one or more such lots under this chapter to be used on one or more other lots, according to the provisions of this subsection 23.45.516.E.

 1. Up to all of the capacity on one lot, referred to in this subsection 23.45.516.E as the "base lot," for chargeable floor area in addition to the base FAR, pursuant to Section 23.45.510 (referred to in this subsection E as "bonus capacity"), may be used on one or more other lots, subject to compliance with all conditions to obtaining extra residential floor area, pursuant to Chapter 23.58A, as modified in this Section 23.45.516. For purposes of applying any conditions related to amenities or features provided on site under this Section 23.45.516, only the lot or lots on which such bonus capacity is used are considered to be the lot or site using a bonus. Criteria for use of extra residential floor area that apply to the structure or structures shall be applied only to the structure(s) on the lots using the transferred bonus capacity. For purposes of the condition to height above 240 feet in subsection C.2.b.3) of this Section 23.45.516, all lots in a combined lot development are considered as one lot.

 2. Only if all of the bonus capacity on all lots in a combined lot development is used on fewer than all of those lots, there may be transferred from a base lot where no bonus capacity is used, to one or more other lots in the combined lot development, up to all of the unused base FAR on the base lot, without regard to limits on the transfer of TDP or on use of TDP in Chapter 23.58A or subsection 23.45.516.D. Such transfer shall be treated as a transfer of TDP for purposes of determining remaining development capacity on the base lot and TDP available to transfer under Chapter 23.58A, but shall be treated as additional base FAR on the other lots, and, to the extent that, together with other base floor area, it does not exceed the amount of chargeable floor area below the base height limit on the lot where it is used, it shall not be treated as extra residential floor area. If less than all of the bonus capacity of the base lot is used on such other lots, and if the base lot qualifies as a sending lot for TDP, the unused base FAR may be transferred as TDP to the extent permitted by Chapter 23.58A and this section, but in each case only to satisfy in part the conditions to extra floor area, not as additional base FAR.

 3. To the extent permitted by the Director, the maximum chargeable floor area for any one or more lots in the combined lot development may be increased up to the combined maximum chargeable floor area under Section 23.45.510 computed for all lots participating in the combined lot development, provided that the maximum chargeable floor area on one or more other lots in the combined lot development is correspondingly reduced. To the extent permitted by the Director, and subject to subsection 23.45.516.E.2 above, the base floor area for any one or more lots in the combined lot development may be increased up to the combined base chargeable floor area under Section 23.45.510 computed for all lots participating in the combined lot development, provided that the base floor area on one or more other lots in the combined lot development is correspondingly reduced.

 4. The Director shall allow a combined lot development only to the extent that the Director determines, in a Type I land use decision, that permitting more chargeable floor area than would otherwise be allowed on a lot or lots and the corresponding reduction on another lot or lots will result in a significant public benefit through one of more of the following:

 a. preservation of a landmark structure located on the block or on an adjacent block either through the inclusion of the lot with the landmark structure as a base lot in the combined lot development or through the transfer of TDP from the lot with the landmark structure to a lot in the combined lot development;

 b. inclusion on the same block of a structure in which low-income housing is provided to satisfy all or part of the conditions to extra residential floor area; and/or

 c. provision of open space on the same block to satisfy in part the conditions to extra residential floor area.

 5. The fee owners of each of the combined lots shall execute an appropriate agreement or instrument, which shall include the legal descriptions of each lot and shall be recorded in the King County real property records. In the agreement or instrument, the owners shall acknowledge the extent to which development capacity on each base lot is reduced by the use of such capacity on another lot or lots, at least for so long as the chargeable floor area for which such capacity is used remains on such other lot or lots. The agreement or instrument shall also provide that its covenants and conditions shall run with the land and shall be specifically enforceable by the parties and by the City of Seattle.

 6. Nothing in this subsection 23.45.516.E shall allow the development on any lot in a combined lot development to exceed or deviate from height limits or other development standards.

 F. Neighborhood Green Street Setback. Floor area may be gained for a neighborhood green street setback according to the provisions of Chapter 23.58A by development on lots abutting one of the streets or street segments within the First Hill Urban Village shown on Map A for 23.45.516.

[Map A for 23.45.516](/~ordpics/MapAfor23.45.516.gif)

 G. Neighborhood open space. In HR zones, subject to the limits in this Section 23.45.516 and Chapter 23.58A, extra residential floor area may be gained through a voluntary agreement to provide neighborhood open space or a payment in lieu of neighborhood open space, according to the provisions of Section 23.58A.016.

 Section 32. Section 23.45.056, relating to setbacks in Midrise zones, which section was last amended by Ordinance 122050, is amended and recodified as follows:

 Section 53. Section 23.47A.006 of the Seattle Municipal Code, which section was last amended by Ordinance 122311, is amended as follows:

 23.47A.006 Conditional uses.

~~A. All conditional uses are subject to the procedures described in Chapter 23.76, Master Use Permits and Council Land Use Decisions, and must not be materially detrimental to the public welfare or injurious to property in the zone or vicinity in which the property is located. In authorizing a conditional use, the Director or City Council may require that adverse impacts be mitigated by imposing any conditions to protect other properties in the zone or vicinity, to compensate for impacts, and to protect the public interest. The Director shall deny or recommend denial of a conditional use if the Director determines that adverse impacts cannot be mitigated satisfactorily.~~B

A. The following uses, where identified as administrative conditional uses on Table A for Section 23.47A.004, or other ~~features of development~~uses identified in this Section 23.47A.004, may be permitted by the Director when the provisions of both~~subsection 23.47A.006.A~~Section 23.42.042 and this subsection 23.47A.004.B are met ~~subject to the further provisions of this subsection~~:~~~~1. Drinking establishments. Drinking establishments in NC1 and NC2 zones may be permitted as a conditional use subject to the following ~~conditions or criteria~~:

 a. The size of the drinking establishment, design of the structure, signing and illumination must be compatible with the character of the commercial area and other structures in the vicinity, particularly in areas where a distinct and definite pattern or style has been established.

 b. The location, access and design of parking must be compatible with adjacent residential zones.

 c. Special consideration will be given to the location and design of the doors and windows of drinking establishments to help ensure that noise standards will not be exceeded. The Director may require additional setbacks and/or restrict openings where the drinking establishment is located on a lot that abuts or is across from a residential zone.

 d. Drinking establishments must not generate traffic that creates traffic congestion or further worsens spillover parking on residential streets.

 2. Park~~-~~and~~-~~ride lots. Park-and-ride lots in NC3, C1 and C2 zones may be permitted as conditional uses subject to the following ~~conditions or criteria~~:

 a. The park~~-~~and~~-~~ride lot shall have direct vehicular access to a designated arterial improved to City standards.

 b. If the proposed park-and-ride lot is located on a lot containing accessory parking for other uses, there must be no substantial conflict in the principal operating hours of the park-and-ride lot and other uses on the lot.

 c. The Director may require landscaping and screening in addition to that required for surface parking areas, noise mitigation, vehicular access control, signage restrictions, and other measures to provide comfort and safety for pedestrians and bicyclists and to ensure the compatibility of the park~~-~~and~~-~~ride lot with the surrounding area.

 3. Residential Uses in C2 zones.

 a. Residential uses may be permitted in C2 zones as a conditional use subject to the following criteria:

~~(~~1) The residential use generally should not be located in an area with direct access to major transportation systems such as freeways, state routes and freight rail lines.

~~(~~2) The residential use generally should not be located in close proximity to industrial areas and/or nonresidential uses or devices that have the potential to create a nuisance or adversely affect the desirability of the area for living purposes as indicated by one of the following:

~~(a)~~i. The nonresidential use is prohibited in the NC3 zone;

~~(b)~~ii. The nonresidential use or device is classified as a major noise generator; or

~~(c)~~iii. The nonresidential use is classified as a major odor source.

~~(~~3) In making a determination to permit or prohibit residential uses in C2 zones, the Director shall take the following factors into account:

~~(a)~~i. The distance between the lot in question and major transportation systems and potential nuisances;

~~(b)~~ii. The presence of physical buffers between the lot in question and major transportation systems and potential nuisance uses;

~~(c)~~iii. The potential cumulative impacts of residential uses on the availability for nonresidential uses of land near major transportation systems; and

~~(d)~~iv. The number, size and cumulative impacts of potential nuisances on the proposed residential uses.

 b. Residential uses required to obtain a shoreline conditional use permit are not required to obtain an administrative conditional use permit.

 c. Additions to, ~~or on-site~~and accessory structures on the same lot as ~~for~~, existing residential structures are permitted outright.

 4. Medical service uses. Medical service uses over ~~ten thousand (~~10,000~~)~~ square feet, outside but within ~~two thousand five hundred (~~2,500~~)~~ feet of a medical Major Institution overlay district boundary, may be approved as administrative conditional uses, except that they are permitted outright if included in an adopted master plan or dedicated to veterinary services. In order to approve a medical service use under this subsection, the Director must determine that an adequate supply of commercially zoned land for businesses serving neighborhood residents will continue to exist. The following factors will be used in making this determination:

 a. Whether the amount of medical service uses existing and proposed in the vicinity would result in an area containing a concentration of medical services with few other uses; and

 b. Whether medical service uses would displace existing neighborhood-serving commercial uses at street level or disrupt a continuous commercial street front, particularly of general sales and services uses, or significantly detract from an area's overall neighborhood-serving commercial character.

 5. Change of One Nonconforming Use to Another. A nonconforming use may be converted by an administrative conditional use authorization to a use not otherwise permitted in the zone based on the following factors:

 a. New uses are limited to those permitted in the next more intensive zone;

 b. The relative impacts of size, parking, traffic, light, glare, noise, odor and similar impacts of the two ~~(2)~~ uses, and how these impacts could be mitigated~~.~~; and

c. The Director must find that the new nonconforming use is no more detrimental to property in the zone and vicinity than the existing nonconforming use.

 6. Lodging uses in NC2 zones. Lodging uses in NC2 zones are permitted up to 25,000 ~~sq. ft.~~square feet, when all of the following conditions are met, except that bed and breakfasts in existing structures are permitted outright with no maximum size limit:

 a. The lodging use contains no more than 50 units;

 b. The proposed development is subjected to City design review, whether required by ~~SMC~~ Chapter 23.41 or not;

 c. The design of the development, including but not limited to signing and illumination, is compatible with surrounding commercial areas; and

 d. Auto access is via an arterial street that does not draw traffic through primarily residentially zoned areas.

~~C.~~B. The following uses, identified as Council Conditional Uses on Table A of Section 23.47A.004, may be permitted by the Council when the ~~conditions of subsection A of this section~~provisions of Section 23.42.042 are met, subject to the following additional provisions:

 1. In C1 and C2 zones, new bus bases for ~~one hundred fifty~~~~(~~150~~)~~ or fewer buses, and existing bus bases that are proposed to be expanded to accommodate additional buses, according to the following standards and criteria.

 a. The bus base has vehicular access, suitable for use by buses, to a designated arterial improved to City standards; and

 b. The lot includes adequate buffering from the surrounding area and the impacts created by the bus base have been effectively mitigated.

 c. The Council may require mitigating measures, which may include, but are not limited to:

~~(~~1) Noise mitigation,

~~(~~2) An employee ridesharing program,

~~(~~3) Landscaping and screening,

~~(~~4) Odor mitigation,

~~(~~5) Vehicular access controls, and

~~(~~6) Other measures to ensure the compatibility of the bus base with the surrounding area.

 2. Helistops in NC3, C1 and C2 zones as accessory uses, according to the following ~~standards and criteria~~:

 a. The helistop is used solely for the takeoff and landing of helicopters serving public safety, news gathering or emergency medical care functions; is a public facility that is part of a City and regional transportation plan approved by the City Council; or is part of a City and regional transportation plan approved by the City Council and is not within ~~two thousand~~~~(~~2,000~~)~~ feet of a residential zone.

 b. The helistop is located so as to minimize impacts on surrounding areas.

 c. The lot includes sufficient buffering of the operations of the helistop from the surrounding area.

 d. Open areas and landing pads are hard-surfaced.

 e. The helistop meets all federal requirements, including those for safety, glide angles and approach lanes.

 3. Work-release centers in all NC zones and C zones, according to the following standards and criteria:

 a. Maximum Number of Residents. No work-release center may house more than ~~fifty~~~~(~~50~~)~~ persons, excluding resident staff.

 b. Dispersion Criteria.

~~(~~1) Each lot line of any new or expanding work-release center must be located ~~six hundred~~~~)~~600~~)~~ feet or more from any residential zone, any lot line of any assisted living facility, congregate residence, domestic violence shelter or nursing home, and any lot line of any school.

~~(~~2) Each lot line of any new or expanding work-release center must be located one ~~(1)~~ mile or more from any lot line of any other work-release center.

 c. The Council's decision shall be based on the following criteria, after review by the Director and the Seattle Police Department:

~~(~~1) The applicant must demonstrate the need for the new or expanding facility in the City;

~~(~~2) The applicant must demonstrate that the facility can be made secure through a security plan to appropriately monitor and control residents, through a staffing plan for the facility, and through compliance with the security standards of the American Corrections Association;

~~(~~3) Proposed lighting must be located so as to minimize spillover light on surrounding properties while maintaining appropriate intensity and hours of use to ensure that security is maintained;

~~(~~8) Verification from the Department of Corrections (DOC) must be provided that the proposed work-release center meets DOC standards for such facilities and that the facility will meet state laws and requirements.

~~D. Any authorized conditional use that has been discontinued shall not be re-established or recommenced except pursuant to a new conditional use permit. The following shall constitute conclusive evidence that the conditional use has been discontinued:~~1. A permit to change the use of the property has been issued and the new use has been established; or

 2. The property has not been devoted to the authorized conditional use for more than twenty-four (24) consecutive months. Property that is vacant, or that is used only for dead storage of materials or equipment, shall not be considered as being devoted to the authorized conditional use. The expiration of licenses necessary for the conditional use shall be evidence that the property is not being devoted to the conditional use. A conditional use in a multifamily structure or a multi-tenant commercial structure shall not be considered discontinued unless all portions of the structure are either vacant or devoted to another use.

 Section 55. Subsections A, C, and F of Section 23.54.020 of the Seattle Municipal Code, which section was last amended by Ordinance 123046, are amended as follows, and new subsections M and N are added to read as follows:

 23.54.020 Parking quantity exceptions.

 The parking quantity exceptions set forth in this section apply in all zones except downtown zones, which are regulated by Section 23.49.019, and Major Institution zones, which are regulated by Section 23.54.016.

 A. Adding Units to Existing Structures in Multifamily and Commercial Zones.

 1. For the purposes of this ~~s~~Section 23.54.020 , "existing structures" means those structures that were established under permit, or for which a permit has been granted and has not expired as of the applicable date, as follows:

 a. In multifamily zones, August 10, 1982;

 b. In commercial zones, June 9, 1986.

 2. ~~If an existing residential structure in a multifamily or commercial zone has parking that meets the development standards, and the lot area is not increased, one (1) unit may be added without additional parking. If two (2) units are added, one (1) space will be required; three (3) units will require two (2) spaces, etc. Additional parking must meet all development standards for the particular zone.~~ In locations where there is a minimum parking requirement, one dwelling unit may be added to an existing structure in a multifamily or commercial zone without additional parking if both of the following requirements are met:

a. Either the existing parking provided on the lot meets development standards, or the lot area is not increased and existing parking is screened and landscaped to the greatest extent practical; and  b. Any additional parking shall meet all development standards for the zone.

~~3. In a Lowrise Duplex/Triplex zone:~~a. When an existing residential structure provides less than one (1) parking space per unit, one (1) parking space is required for each additional dwelling unit when dwelling units are added to the structure or the structure is altered to create additional dwelling units;

 b. When an existing nonresidential structure is partially or completely converted to residential use, then no parking space shall be required for the first new dwelling unit, provided that the lot area is not increased and existing parking is screened and landscaped to the greatest extent practical.

 Additional parking provided shall meet all development standards for the Lowrise Duplex/Triplex zone.

3. In locations where there is a minimum parking requirement, the Director may authorize a reduction or waiver of the parking requirement as a Type I decision when dwelling units are proposed to be added to an existing structure in a multifamily or commercial zone, in addition to the exception permitted in subsection 23.54.020.A.2, if the conditions in subsections 23.54.020.A.3.a and b below are met, and either of the conditions in subsections 23.54.020.A.3.c or d below are met:  a. The only use of the structure will be residential; and

 b. The lot is not located in either the University District Parking Overlay Area (Map A for 23.54.015) or the Alki Area Parking Overlay (Map B for 23.54.015); and

 c. The topography of the lot or location of existing structures makes provision of an off-street parking space physically infeasible in a conforming location; or

 d. The lot is located in a residential parking zone (RPZ) and a current parking study is submitted showing a utilization rate of less than 75 percent for on-street parking within 400 feet of all lot lines.

~~4. If an existing structure does not conform to the development standards for parking, or is occupied by a nonconforming use, no parking space is required for the first new or added dwelling unit, provided:~~a. The lot area is not increased and existing parking is screened and landscaped to the greatest extent practical.

 b. Additional parking provided shall meet all development standards for the particular zone.

 c. This exception shall does not apply in Lowrise Duplex/Triplex zones.

~~~~* * *

 C. Parking Exception for Landmark Structures. The Director may reduce or waive the minimum accessory off-street parking requirements for a use permitted in a Landmark structure, or when a Landmark structure is completely converted to residential use according to Sections 23.42.108 or 23.45.~~006~~506, or for a use in a Landmark district that is located in a commercial zone, as a special exception pursuant to Chapter 23.76, Procedures for Master Use Permits and Council Land Use Decisions.

 1. In making any such reduction or waiver, the Director will assess area parking needs. The Director may require a survey of on- and off-street parking availability. The Director may take into account the level of transit service in the immediate area; the probable relative importance of walk-in traffic; proposals by the applicant to encourage carpooling or transit use by employees; hours of operation; and any other factor or factors considered relevant in determining parking impact.

 2. The Director may also consider the types and scale of uses proposed or practical in the Landmark structure, and the controls imposed by the Landmark designation.

 3. Such a reduction or waiver may be allowed, for conversion of structures to residential use, only if the Director also determines that there is no feasible way to meet parking requirements on the lot.

 * * *

 F. Reductions to Minimum Parking Requirements.

 1. Reductions to minimum parking requirements permitted by this subsection 23.54.020.F will be calculated from the minimum parking requirements in Section 23.54.015. Total reductions to required parking as provided in this subsection may not exceed 40 percent.

 2. Transit Reduction.

 a. In multifamily and commercial ~~NC~~ zones~~and C zones, except pedestrian-designated zones, and in the Seattle Mixed (SM) zone, except on Class 1 Pedestrian Streets~~, the minimum parking requirement for ~~a nonresidential use, except institutions,~~all uses may be reduced by 20 percent when the use is located within 800 feet of a street with midday transit service headways of 15 minutes or less in each direction. This distance will be the walking distance measured from the nearest bus stop to the ~~property~~lot line of the lot containing the use.

~~b. In NC, C and SM zones, any minimum parking requirement for a residential use may be reduced by 20 percent when the use is located within 800 feet of a street with midday transit service headways of 15 minutes or less in each direction. This distance will be the walking distance measured from the nearest bus stop to the property line of the lot containing the use.~~

~~c.~~b. In industrial zones, the minimum parking requirement for a nonresidential use may be reduced by 15 percent when the use is located within 800 feet of a street with peak transit service headways of 15 minutes or less in each direction. This distance will be the walking distance measured from the nearest bus stop to the ~~property~~lot line of the lot containing the use.

 3. For new or expanding offices or manufacturing uses that require 40 or more parking spaces, the minimum parking requirement may be reduced by up to a maximum of 40 percent by the substitution of alternative transportation programs, according to the following provisions:

 a. For every certified carpool space accompanied by a cash fee, performance bond or alternative guarantee acceptable to the Director, the total parking requirement will be reduced by 1.9 spaces, up to a maximum of 40 percent of the parking requirement. The Director will consult with the Director of the Seattle ~~Rideshare Office~~ Department of Transportation in certifying carpool spaces and the location of carpool parking.

 b. For every certified vanpool purchased or leased by the applicant for employee use, or equivalent cash fee for purchase of a van by the public ridesharing agency, the total parking requirement will be reduced by six spaces, up to a maximum of 20 percent of the parking requirement. Before a certificate of occupancy may be issued, details of the vanpool program shall be specified in a Memorandum of Agreement executed between the proponent, the Director, and the Director of the Seattle ~~Rideshare Office~~Department of Transportation.

 c. If transit or transportation passes are provided with a 50 percent or greater cost reduction to all employees in a proposed structure for the duration of the business establishment(s) within it, or 5 years, whichever is less, and if transit service is located within 800 feet, the parking requirement shall be reduced by 10 percent. With a 25 percent to 49 percent cost reduction, and if transit service is located within 800 feet, the parking requirement shall be reduced by 5 percent.

 d. For every four covered bicycle parking spaces provided, the total parking requirement shall be reduced by one space, up to a maximum of 5 percent of the parking requirement, provided that there is access to an arterial over improved streets.

 * * *

 M. In urban centers or the Station Area Overlay District, no parking for motor vehicles is required for uses in commercial and multifamily zones, except that parking for fleet vehicles is required pursuant to Section 23.54.035.

N. No parking is required for business establishments permitted in multifamily zones.

Section 59. Section 23.58A.013 of the Seattle Municipal Code, which Section was enacted by Ordinance 122882, is hereby reenacted and amended as follows:

 23.58A.013 Affordable housing incentive programs: purpose and findings

 A. Purpose; Scope of provisions; State Law Controlling. The provisions of this subchapter 23.58A related to housing bonus residential floor area are intended to implement affordable housing incentive programs authorized by RCW 36.70A.540, as it may be amended.~~The purpose of affordable housing incentive programs is to encourage higher density residential development in appropriate areas while ensuring that a portion of the additional development will be affordable housing, pursuant to authority granted in RCW 36.70A.540.~~ In case of any irreconcilable conflict between the terms of this ~~section~~subchapter 23.58A related to housing bonus residential floor area and the authority granted in RCW 36.70A.540, as it may be amended, the provisions of RCW 36.70A.540, as it may be amended, shall supersede and control. Unless the context otherwise clearly requires, references to RCW 36.70A.540 in this subchapter 23.58A mean that section as in effect on the date as of which the provisions of this title apply to the application for a use permit for the project using the bonus floor area.

 B. Findings. Pursuant to the authority of RCW 36.70A.540, the City finds that the higher income levels specified in the definition of "income-eligible households" in Section"23.58A.004, rather than these stated in the definition of "low-income households" in RCW 36.70A.5"0, are needed to address local housing market conditions throughout the City.

 Section 60. Subsections B and C of Section 23.58A.014 of the Seattle Municipal Code, which Section was enacted by Ordinance 122882, are amended as follows:

 23.58A.014 Bonus residential floor area for affordable housing

 * * *

 B. Performance option.

 1. An applicant using the performance option shall provide low-income housing with a gross floor area at least equal to the greatest of (a) 17.5 percent of the net bonus residential floor area obtained through the performance option, except that an applicant may elect to provide low-income housing equal to 10 percent of the net bonus residential floor area obtained through the performance option if the housing is affordable to, and restricted to occupancy by, households with incomes no higher than 50% of median income as defined by Section 23.84A.025; or (b) 300 net residential square feet; or (c) any minimum floor area specified in the provisions of the zone. The percentage of net bonus residential floor area obtained through the performance option to be provided as low-income housing may be reduced by the Council below 17.5 percent of the net bonus residential floor area to no less than 15 percent of the net bonus residential floor area as a Type V decision on an official land use map amendment or text amendment when the Council determines that the reduction is needed to accomplish Comprehensive Plan goals and policies or to reflect economic conditions of the area. Applicants may provide low- income housing as part of the project using extra floor area, or by providing or contributing to a low-income housing project at another location, subject to requirements in subsection  23.58A.014.B.5 of this section and approval~~ed~~ in writing by the ~~Housing Director~~Director of Housing prior to issuance of the first building permit for the development using the bonus floor area.

 2. Affordable housing shall serve only income-eligible households for a minimum period of 50 years from the later of the date when the agreement between the housing owner and the City, as referenced in subsection 23.58A.014.B.5, is recorded, or the date when the affordable housing becomes available for occupancy as determined by the City. For rental housing, rent shall be limited so that housing costs, including rent and basic utilities, shall not exceed 30 percent of the ~~applicable income limit~~income limit for the unit under this section, all as determined by the ~~Housing Director~~Director of Housing, for a minimum period of 50 years. For owner-occupied housing, the initial sale price shall not exceed an amount determined by the ~~Housing Director~~Director of Housing to be consistent with affordable housing for an income-eligible household with the average family size expected to occupy the unit based on the number of bedrooms, and the units shall be subject to recorded instruments satisfactory to the ~~Housing Director~~Director of Housing providing for sales prices on any resale consistent with affordability on the same basis for at least 50 years.

~~(a)~~a. The affordable housing must serve income-eligible households for the minimum time period referred to in this section.

~~(b)~~b. The affordable housing shall be completed and ready for occupancy at or before the time when a certificate of occupancy is issued for any other units in the project using the bonus residential floor area, and as a condition to any right of the applicant to such a certificate of occupancy.

 5. If the affordable housing is not being developed within the project using the bonus residential floor area:

~~(a)~~a. Proposals for affordable housing at a location other than within the project using the bonus floor area are subject to approval by the ~~Housing Director~~Director of Housing . Approval requires a determination by the ~~Housing Director~~ Director of Housing that the affordable housing will (1) be located within the same neighborhood where the development using the bonus residential floor area is located, except as otherwise provided in subsection 23.58A.014.B.5.b~~B5(b) of this section~~; (2) provide a public benefit~~, the value of which, as demonstrated by the applicant, exceeds the amount of the payment-in-lieu that would otherwise be paid~~; and (3) be more affordable than market rents or sale prices, as applicable, for housing in the neighborhood in which the affordable housing is located.

~~(b)~~b. If the applicant demonstrates to the satisfaction of the ~~Housing Director~~Director of Housing that it is infeasible for the off-site affordable housing to be located within the same neighborhood where the development using the bonus residential floor area is located, then (1)~~(i)~~the~~Housing Director~~Director of Housing may allow the affordable housing to be provided elsewhere ~~in the City~~within the Seattle city limits, which is deemed within the general area of the development using the bonus residential floor area in accordance with RCW 36.70A.540, provided that the affordable housing is within 0.5 mile of a light rail or bus rapid transit station, or ~~(ii)~~(2) if the applicant demonstrates that providing the affordable housing in such a location is also infeasible, then the ~~Housing Director~~Director of Housing may allow the ~~off-site~~affordable housing to be provided within .25 mile of a bus or streetcar stop~~elsewhere within the same City sector, as delineated by Interstate-5, the Ship Canal and Interstate- 90 (as projected to Elliott Bay), where the development using the bonus residential floor area is located~~.

~~(e)~~e. The applicant shall provide to the City an irrevocable letter of credit, or other sufficient security approved by the ~~Housing Director~~Director of Housing, prior to and as a condition of issuance of the first building permit, other than for grading and shoring, for the project using the bonus residential floor area, unless completion of the affordable housing has already been documented to the satisfaction of the ~~Housing Director~~Director of Housing and the affordable housing is subject to recorded restrictions satisfactory to the ~~Housing Director~~Director of Housing. The letter of credit or other security shall be in an amount equal to the Payment Option amount calculated according to provisions in subsection  23.58A.014.C ~~of this section~~, plus an amount equal to interest on such payment, at the rate equal to the prime rate quoted by Bank of America or its successor at the time the letter of credit or other security is provided, plus 3 percent per annum, from the date of issuance of the first building permit, other than for excavation and shoring, for the project using the bonus residential floor area. The letter of credit or other security shall be on terms such that when a certificate of occupancy is issued for the project using the bonus residential floor area, or on any earlier date 30 days before the letter of credit or other security will expire, if the required quantity of affordable housing is not completed and ready for occupancy or the affordable housing is not all subject to a recorded agreement sufficient to satisfy the terms of this ~~s~~Section 23.58A.014, the City shall have a right to draw on the letter of credit or other security. If and when the City becomes entitled to realize on any such security, the ~~Housing Director~~ Director of Housing shall take appropriate steps to collect the amount calculated pursuant to the ~~p~~Payment ~~o~~Option provisions in subsection 23.58A.014.C ~~of this section~~ (after allowing credit for any affordable housing then provided and accepted by the ~~Housing Director~~Director of Housing, with interest for the period and at the rate determined pursuant to this subsection, and the amounts realized, net of any costs to the City, shall be used in the same manner as cash payments for housing made under this section. To the extent the City receives payment through a letter of credit or other security, the obligation of the applicant to provide affordable housing will be deemed satisfied and the applicant shall be deemed to have elected the payment option. The applicant shall not be entitled to any refund based on later completion of affordable housing.

~~(f)~~f. If the ~~Housing Director~~ Director of Housing certifies to the Director that either ~~(i)~~ (1) the applicant has provided the City with a letter of credit or other sufficient security pursuant to subsection 23.58A.014.B.5.e~~B5(e) of this section~~; or ~~(ii)~~ (2)

 there have been recorded one or more agreements or instruments satisfactory to the ~~Housing Director~~Director of Housing providing for occupancy and affordability restrictions on affordable housing with the minimum floor area determined under this ~~s~~S ection 23.58A.014, all affordable housing have been completed, and the affordable housing is on a different lot from the bonus residential floor area or are in one or more condominium units separate from the bonus residential floor area under condominium documents acceptable to the ~~Housing Director~~Director of Housing, then any failure of the affordable housing to satisfy the requirements of ~~this subsection B~~subsection 23.58A.014.B shall not affect the right to maintain or occupy the bonus residential floor area.

~~(g)~~g. Unless and until the ~~Housing Director~~Director of Housing shall certify as set forth in clause ~~(i)~~(1) or ~~(ii)~~(2) of subsection  23.58A.014.B.5.f~~B5(f) of this section~~, it shall be a continuing permit condition, whether or not expressly stated, for each project obtaining bonus residential floor area based on the provision of housing to which this section applies, that the affordable housing shall be maintained in compliance with the terms of this ~~s~~Section  23.58A.014 and any applicable provisions of the zone, as documented to the satisfaction of the ~~Housing Director~~Director of Housing.

 6. No subsidies for bonused housing; Exception.

~~(a)~~a. The ~~Housing Director~~Director of Housing may require, as a condition of any bonus residential floor area under the performance option, that the owner of the lot upon which the affordable housing is located agree not to seek or accept any subsidies, including without limitation those items referred to subsection 23.58A.014.B.6.b.1~~B6(b)(i) of this section~~, related to housing, except for any subsidies that may be allowed by the ~~Housing Director~~Director of Housing under ~~that~~ subsection  23.58A.014.B.6.d. The Director may require that such agreement provide for the payment to the City, for deposit in an appropriate subfund or account, of the value of any subsidies received in excess of any amounts allowed by such agreement.

~~(b)~~b. In general, and except as may be otherwise required by applicable federal or state law, no bonus residential floor area may be earned by providing housing if:

~~(i)~~1) Any person is receiving or will receive with respect to the housing any charitable contributions or public subsidies for housing development or operation, including, but not limited to, tax exempt bond financing, tax credits, federal loans or grants, City of Seattle housing loans or grants, county housing funds, and State of Washington housing funds; or

~~(ii)~~2) The housing is or would be, independent of the requirements for the bonus residential floor area, subject to any restrictions on the income of occupants, rents or sale prices.

~~(c)~~c. For the purpose of this subsection  23.58A.014.B.6, the qualification for and use of property tax exemptions pursuant to Chapter 5.73 SMC, or any other program implemented pursuant to Chapter 84.14 RCW, does not constitute a subsidy, and any related conditions regarding incomes, rent or sale prices do not constitute restrictions.

~~(d)~~d. As an exception to the restriction on subsidies, the ~~Housing Director~~Director of Housing may allow the building or buildings in which the affordable housing is located to be financed in part with subsidies based on the determination that (1) the total amount of affordable housing is at least 300 net residential square feet greater than the amount otherwise required through the performance option under this section; (2) the public benefit of the affordable housing net of any subsidies, as measured through an economic analysis, exceeds the amount of the payment-in-lieu that would otherwise be paid; and (3) the subsidies being allowed would not be sufficient to leverage private funds for production of the affordable housing, under restrictions as required for the performance option, without additional City subsidy in an amount greater than the payment-in-lieu amount that would otherwise be paid.

 7. The ~~Housing Director~~Director of Housing is authorized to accept and execute agreements and instruments to implement this ~~s~~Section 23.58A.014. Issuance of the certificate of occupancy for the project using the bonus residential floor area may be conditioned on such agreements and instruments.

 8. The housing owner, in the case of rental housing, shall provide annual reports and pay an annual monitoring fee to the Office of Housing for each affordable housing unit, as specified under Chapter 22.900G. In the case of affordable housing for owner-occupancy, the applicant shall pay an initial monitoring fee to the Office of Housing as specified under Chapter 22.900G, and the recorded resale restrictions shall include a provision requiring payment to the City, on any sale or other transfer of a unit after the initial sale, of a fee in the amount of $500, to be adjusted in proportion to changes in the consumer price index from 2008 to the year in which the sale or transfer is made, for the review and processing of documents to determine compliance with income and affordability restrictions.

 C. Payment option. The payment option is available only where the maximum height for residential use under the provisions of the zone is more than 85 feet and only if the Director determines that the payment achieves a result equal to or better than providing the affordable housing on-site and the payment does not exceed the approximate cost of developing the same number and quality of housing units that would otherwise be developed.

 1. Amount of payments. In lieu of all or part of the performance option, an applicant may pay to the City $18.94 per square foot of net bonus residential floor area.

 2. Timing of payments. Cash payments shall be made prior to issuance, and as a condition to issuance, of any building permit after the first building permit for a project, and in any event before any permit for any construction activity other than excavation and shoring is issued, unless the applicant elects in writing to defer payment. If the applicant elects to defer payment, then the issuance of any certificate of occupancy for the project shall be conditioned upon payment of the full amount of the cash payment determined under this ~~s~~Section  23.58A.014, plus an interest factor equal to that amount multiplied by the increase, if any, in the Consumer Price Index, All Urban Consumers, West Region, All Items, 1982-84=100, as published monthly, from the last month prior to the date when payment would have been required if deferred payment had not been elected, to the last month for which data are available at the time of payment. If the index specified in this subsection 23.58A.014.C.2 is not available for any reason, the Director shall select a substitute cost of living index. In no case shall the interest factor be less than zero.

 3. Deposit and use of payments. Payments in lieu of affordable housing shall be deposited in a special account established solely to support the development of low-income housing as defined in this chapter. Earnings on balances in the special account shall accrue to that account. The ~~Housing Director~~Director of Housing shall use cash payments and any earnings thereon to support the development ~~or preservation~~ of low-income housing in any manner now or hereafter permitted by RCW 36.70A.540, including renter or owner housing for income- eligible households. Uses of funds may include ~~land purchase for the purpose of providing low-income housing;~~ the City's costs to administer projects, not to exceed 10 percent of the payments into the special account ~~loans or grants to public or private owners or developers of housing; and loans or grants to affordable households for home purchases. The location of a~~. Affordable housing funded wholly or in part with cash payments shall be located within eligible areas within the Seattle city limits, which is deemed the general area of the development using the bonus residential floor area in accordance with RCW 36.70A.540. Eligible areas shall be prioritized in the following order: (1) within the same neighborhoods where the developments using the bonus residential floor area are located; (2) ~~in the City~~ within 0.5 mile of light rail or bus rapid transit stations; and (3) within 0.25 mile of a bus or streetcar stop~~the same City sectors delineated by Interstate-5, the Ship Canal and Interstate-90 (as projected to Elliott Bay) where the developments using the bonus residential floor area are located~~.

 Section 61. A new Section 23.58A.016 is added to Subchapter II of Chapter 23.58A of the Seattle Municipal Code, as follows:

 23.58A.016 Bonus residential floor area for amenities

 A. Findings. The City Council finds that:

 1. Amenities, including public open space, are an important aspect of livability in areas targeted in the Comprehensive Plan for concentrated housing and employment growth. To address this need, the Comprehensive Plan establishes goals for the amount and distribution of open space. These goals are consistent with national standards developed to assist communities with planning to provide adequate open space serving specified population needs.

 2. Projects that add density will increase demand for public open space. If additional public open space is voluntarily provided to offset additional demand, the impacts on available open space resources will be mitigated.

 3. The average amount of public open space, including breathing room open space, needed to accommodate residential development is at least 0.14 square feet of open space per gross square foot of residential floor area in a project.

 B. Voluntary agreements for amenities. Where expressly permitted by the provisions of the zone, an applicant may achieve bonus residential floor area in part through a voluntary agreement for provision of amenities to mitigate impacts of the project, subject to the limits in this chapter.

 1. Amenities that may be provided for bonus residential floor area include:

 a. neighborhood open space, and

 b. green street setbacks on lots abutting designated green streets.

 2. The amenities listed in subsection 23.58A.016.B.1 are referred to as "open space amenities" in this Section 23.58A.016. Mitigation of impacts identified in subsection 23.58A.016.A above may be achieved by the performance option, by the payment option, or by a combination of the performance and payment options.

 C. Performance option.

 1. General. An applicant electing to use the performance option shall provide the amenity on the same lot as the development using the bonus floor area, except to the extent a combined lot development is expressly permitted by the provisions of the zone. The maximum area of any amenity or combination of amenities provided on a lot eligible for a bonus is established in this subsection 23.58A.016.C and may be further limited by Section 23.58A.012 or the provisions of the zone. Open space amenities must meet the standards of this subsection 23.58A.016.C in order to qualify for bonus residential floor area, except as may be authorized by the Director under ~~that~~ subsection 23.58A.016.C.4. An open space amenity may also qualify as a required residential amenity to the extent permitted by the provisions of the zone.

 2. Maximum open space amenity for bonus. Unless otherwise specified in the provisions of the zone, the amount of open space amenity for which bonus residential floor area may be allowed shall not exceed the lesser of the amount required to mitigate the impact created by the total bonus residential floor area in the project, or 15,000 square feet. For purposes of this Section 23.58A.016, the amount of open space required to mitigate that impact is 0.14 square feet of open space amenity per square foot of bonus residential floor area, unless the Director determines, as a Type I decision, that a different ratio applies based on consideration of one or both of the following:

 a. the overall number or density of people anticipated to use or occupy the structure(s) in which bonus residential floor area will be located, in relation to the total floor area of the structure(s), is different from the density level of approximately 1.32 persons per 1,000 gross square feet, which was used to establish the ratio in subsection 23.58A.016.C, such that a different amount of open space is needed to mitigate the project impacts;

 b. characteristics or features of the project mitigate the impacts that the anticipated population using or occupying the structure(s) in which bonus residential floor area will be located would otherwise have on open space needs.

 3. Bonus Ratio. Neighborhood amenities may be used to gain bonus residential floor area according to the following ratios and subject to the limits of this Section 23.58A.016:

 a. For a neighborhood open space, 7 square feet of bonus residential floor area per 1 square foot of qualifying neighborhood open space area (7:1).

 b. For a green street setback, 5 square feet of bonus residential floor area per 1 square foot of qualifying green street setback area (5:1).

 4. Standards for open space amenities. The following standards apply to all open space amenities identified in this subsection 23.58A.016.C.4 except as otherwise specifically stated in this subsection 23.58A.016.C.4 or in the provisions of the zone.

 a. Public Access. The open space must be open during daylight hours and accessible to the general public, without charge, for reasonable and predictable hours, for a minimum of 10 hours each day of the year, except that access may be limited temporarily as required for public safety and maintenance reasons. Within the open space, property owners, tenants and their agents shall allow members of the public to engage in activities allowed in the public sidewalk environment, except that those activities that would require a street use permit if conducted on the sidewalk may be excluded or restricted. Free speech activities such as hand billing, signature gathering, and holding signs, all without obstructing access to the space, any building, or other adjacent features, and without unreasonably interfering with the enjoyment of the space by others, shall be allowed. While engaged in allowed activities, members of the public may not be asked to leave for any reason other than conduct that unreasonably interferes with the enjoyment of the space by others unless the space is being closed to the general public consistent with this subsection 23.58A.016.C. No parking, storage or other use may be established on or above the surface of the open space except as provided in subsection 23.58A.016.C.4.b.6. Use by motor vehicles of open space for which bonus residential floor area is granted is not permitted. The open space shall be identified clearly with the City's public open space logo on a plaque placed at a visible location at each street entrance providing access to the feature. The plaque shall indicate, in letters legible to passersby, the nature of the bonus feature, its availability for general public access, and additional directional information as needed.

 b. Standards for Neighborhood Open Space. Neighborhood open space used to qualify for bonus floor area must satisfy the conditions in this subsection 23.58A.016.C.4.b, unless an exception is granted by the Director as a Type I decision, based on the Director's determination that, relative to the strict application of the standards, the exception will result in improved public access and use of the space or a better integration of the space with surrounding development:

 1) The open space must be improved in compliance with the applicable provisions of this Section 23.58A.016. The open space must consist of one continuous area with a minimum of 3,000 square feet and a minimum horizontal dimension of 10 feet.

 2) A minimum of 35 percent of the open space must be landscaped with grass, ground cover, bushes and/or trees.

 3) Either permanent or movable seating in an amount equivalent to 1 lineal foot for every 200 square feet of open space shall be available for public use during hours of public access.

 4) The open space shall be located and configured to maximize solar exposure to the space, allow easy access from streets or other abutting public spaces, including access for persons with disabilities, and allow convenient pedestrian circulation through all portions of the open space. The open space must have a minimum frontage of 30 feet at grade abutting a sidewalk, and be visible from sidewalks on at least one street.

 5) The open space shall be provided at ground level, except that in order to provide level open spaces on steep lots, some separation of multiple levels may be allowed, provided they are physically and visually connected.

 6) Up to 20 percent of the open space may be covered by features accessory to public use of the open space, including: permanent, freestanding structures, such as retail kiosks, pavilions, or pedestrian shelters; structural overhangs; overhead arcades or other forms of overhead weather protection; and any other features approved by the Director that contribute to pedestrian comfort and active use of the space. The following features within the open space area may count as open space and are not subject to the percentage coverage limit: temporary kiosks and pavilions, public art, permanent seating that is not reserved for any commercial use, exterior stairs and mechanical assists that provide access to public areas and are available for public use, and any similar features approved by the Director. Seating or tables, or both, may be provided and reserved for customers of restaurants or other uses abutting the open space, but the area reserved for customer seating shall not exceed 15 percent of the open space area or 500 square feet, whichever is less.

 c. Standards for green street setbacks.

 1) Where permitted by the provisions of the zone, bonus residential floor area may be gained for green street setbacks by development on lots abutting those street segments that are listed or shown as green streets in the provisions of the zone.

 2) A green street setback must be provided as a setback from a lot line abutting a designated green street. The setback must be continuous for the length of the frontage of the lot abutting the green street, and a minimum of 50 percent of the setback area eligible for a bonus shall be landscaped. The area of any driveways in the setback area is not included in the bonusable area. For area eligible for a bonus, the average setback from the abutting green street lot line shall not exceed 10 feet, with a maximum setback of 15 feet. The design of the setback area shall allow for public access, such as access to street level uses in abutting structures or access to areas for seating. The Director may grant an exception to the standards in this subsection 23.58A.016.C.4.c as a Type I decision, based on the Director's determination that the exception is consistent with a green street concept plan, if one exists, established in accordance with DR 11-2007, or a successor rule.

 d. Declaration. When open space is to be provided for purposes of obtaining bonus residential floor area, the owner(s) of the lot using the bonus residential floor area, and of the lot where the open space is provided, if different, shall execute and record a declaration and voluntary agreement in a form acceptable to the Director identifying the features; acknowledging that the right to develop and occupy a portion of the gross floor area on the lot is based upon the long-term provision and maintenance of the open space and that development is restricted in the open space; and committing to provide and maintain the open space.

 e. Identification. The open space shall be identified clearly with the City's public open space logo on a plaque placed at a visible location at each street entrance providing access to the feature. The plaque shall indicate, in letters legible to passersby, the nature of the bonus feature, its availability for general public access, and additional directional information as needed.

 f. Duration; Alteration. Except as provided for in this subsection 23.58A.016.C.4.f, the owners of the lot using the bonus residential floor area and of the lot where the open space amenity is located, if different, including all successors, shall provide and maintain the open space amenities for which bonus residential floor area is granted, in accordance with the applicable provisions of this Section 23.58A.016, for as long as the bonus residential floor area gained by the open space amenities exists. An open space amenity for which bonus residential floor area has been granted may be altered or removed only to the extent that either or both of the following occur, and alteration or removal may be further restricted by the provisions of the zone and by conditions of any applicable permit:

 1) The bonus residential floor area permitted in return for the specific open space amenity is removed or converted to a use for which bonus residential floor area is not required under the provisions of the zone; or

 2) An amount of bonus residential floor area equal to that allowed for the open space amenity that is to be diminished or discontinued is provided through alternative means consistent with the provisions of the zone and provisions for allowing bonus residential floor area in this chapter.

 D. Payment option.

 1. There is no payment in lieu option for open space amenities other than neighborhood open space.

 2. Payment in lieu of providing neighborhood open space.

 a. In lieu of all or part of the performance option for neighborhood open space, an applicant may pay to the City an amount determined pursuant to this subsection if the Director determines, as a Type 1 decision, that the payment will contribute to public open space improvements abutting the lot or in the vicinity; that the improvements will meet the additional need for open space caused by the project and are feasible within a reasonable time; and that the applicant agrees to the specific improvements or to the general nature and location of the improvements.

 b. The amount of the payment is determined by multiplying the number of square feet of land that would be provided as neighborhood open space, by the sum of an estimated land value per square foot based on recent transactions in the area and an average square foot cost for open space improvements. The dollar amount per square foot shall be determined by the Director based on any relevant information submitted by the applicant, and any other data related to land values and costs that the Director considers reliable.

 c. Cash payments shall be made prior to issuance, and as a condition to issuance, of the first building permit for a project, and in any event before any permit for any construction activity other than excavation and shoring is issued.

 d. Any payment in lieu of providing neighborhood open space shall be deposited in a dedicated fund or account solely to support acquisition or development of public open space within 0.25 mile of the lot using the bonus floor area, or within another area prescribed by the provisions of the zone, or at another location where the applicant and the Director agree that it will mitigate the direct impacts of the project, and the payment shall be expended within five years of receipt for such purposes.

 Section 62. A new Section 23.58A.018 is added to Subchapter II of Chapter 23.58A of the Seattle Municipal Code, as follows:

 23.58A.018 Transfer of residential development potential

 A. Scope and Applicability.

 1. This Section 23.58A.018 contains rules for transfer of residential development potential to lots in areas for which other provisions of this title specifically refer to provisions of this Section 23.58A.018. The provisions of this Section 23.58A.018 are subject to the applicable provisions of the zone.

 2. Whether a lot may be eligible as a TDP sending site is determined by the provisions of the zone in which the lot is located. To be eligible as a sending lot for a specific category of TDP defined in this Chapter 23.58A, the lot must satisfy the applicable conditions of this Section 23.58A.018 except to the extent otherwise expressly stated in the provisions of the zone. Whether a lot is eligible as a TDP receiving lot, and whether the lot may receive TDP from another lot, and what categories of TDP the lot may receive, are determined by the provisions of the zone. The transfer of TDP and use of TDP on any receiving lot is subject to the limits and conditions in this chapter, the provisions of the zone, and all other applicable provisions of this title.

 B. TDP Required Before Construction. No permit after the first building permit, and in any event, no permit for any construction activity other than excavation and shoring, and no permit for occupancy of existing floor area by any use based upon TDP, will be issued for development that includes TDP until the applicant's possession of TDP is demonstrated to the satisfaction of the Director. ~~~~C. General Standards for Sending Lots.

 1. TDP Calculation. The maximum amount of floor area that may be transferred is the amount by which the base residential floor area of the sending lot exceeds the sum of:

 a. any nonexempt residential floor area existing on the sending lot; plus

 b. any existing floor area of uses accessory to nonexempt residential uses, except to the extent that floor area is exempt from floor area limits under the provisions of the zone; plus

 c. any TDP previously transferred from the sending lot.

 2. Floor Area Limit After Transfer. After TDP is transferred from a sending lot the amount of residential floor area that may then be established on the sending lot, other than floor area exempt from limits on residential floor area under the provisions of the zone, shall be equal to the base residential floor area, plus any net amount of TDP previously transferred to that lot, minus the total of (a) the existing residential floor area on the lot, plus (b) the amount of TDP transferred from the lot.

 D. Standards for Landmark TDP sending lots. Landmark structures on sending lots from which Landmark TDP is transferred shall be rehabilitated and maintained as required by the Landmarks Preservation Board.

 E. Standards for open space TDP sending lots. The following standards apply unless provisions of the zone state otherwise:

 1. General conditions. Open space TDP sites must satisfy the conditions of this subsection 23.58A.018. E.1, unless an exception is granted by the Director:

 a. Each portion of the open space shall be accessible from each other portion of the open space without leaving the open space.

 b. The open space shall have a minimum area of 5,000 square feet.

 c. The open space shall be directly accessible from the sidewalk or another public open space, including access for persons with disabilities.

 d. The open space shall be at ground level, except that in order to provide level open spaces on steep lots, some separation of multiple levels may be allowed, provided they are physically and visually connected.

 e. No more than 20 percent of the lot may be occupied by any above grade structures.

 f. The lot shall be located a minimum of 0.25 mile from the closest lot approved by the Director as a separate open space TDP site, unless the lot is abutting another TDP site and is designed to integrate with the other TDP site.

 g. The open space shall be open during daylight hours and accessible to the general public, without charge, for reasonable and predictable hours, for a minimum of 10 hours each day of the year, except that access may be limited temporarily as required for public safety and maintenance reasons. Within the open space, property owners, tenants and their agents shall allow members of the public to engage in activities allowed in the public sidewalk environment, except that those activities that would require a street use permit if conducted on the sidewalk may be excluded or restricted. Free speech activities such as hand billing, signature gathering, and holding signs, all without obstructing access to the space, any building, or other adjacent features, and without unreasonably interfering with the enjoyment of the space by others, shall be allowed. While engaged in allowed activities, members of the public may not be asked to leave for any reason other than conduct that unreasonably interferes with the enjoyment of the space by others unless the space is being closed to the general public consistent with this subsection 23.58A.018.E.1.g.

 h. The open space shall be identified clearly with the City's public open space logo on a plaque placed at a visible location at each street entrance providing access to the feature. The plaque shall indicate, in letters legible to passersby, the nature of the bonus feature, its availability for general public access, and additional directional information as needed.

 i. Unless the open space will be in public ownership, the applicant shall make adequate provision to ensure the permanent maintenance of the open space.

 2. Special exception for open space TDP sites. The Director may grant, or grant with conditions, an exception to the standards for open space TDP sites in this subsection 23.58A.018.E and any applicable Director's Rule(s), as a special exception pursuant to Chapter 23.76, Procedures for Master Use Permit and Council Land Use Decisions. In determining whether to grant, grant with conditions, or deny a request for special exception under this subsection, the Director shall consider:

 a. the extent to which the exception would result in an open space TDP site that better meets the intent of the provisions of this subsection 23.58A.018.E; and

 b. the extent to which the exception would allow the design of the open space to take advantage of unusual site characteristics or conditions in the surrounding area, such as views and relationship to surroundings.

 3. After any TDP is transferred from an open space TDP site, lot coverage by structures shall be permanently limited to 20 percent, or any greater amount that was allowed as a special exception prior to the transfer, and no development shall be permitted that would be inconsistent with the standards under which it was approved as an open space TDP sending site.

 F. Time of Determination of TDP Eligible for Transfer. The eligibility of a sending lot to transfer TDP, and the amount transferable from a sending lot, shall be determined as of the date of transfer from the sending lot and shall not be affected by the date of any application, permit decision or other action for any project seeking to use the TDP.

 G. Reservation in Deed. Any TDP eligible for transfer may instead be reserved in the conveyance of title to an eligible sending lot, by the express terms of the deed or other instrument of conveyance reserving a specified amount of TDP, provided that an instrument acceptable to the Director is recorded binding the lot to the terms and conditions for eligibility to send TDP under this section 23.58A.018. Any TDP so reserved shall be considered transferred from that lot and later may be conveyed by deed without participation of the owner of the lot.

 H. TDP Deeds and Agreements.

 1. The fee owners of the sending lot shall execute a deed, and shall obtain the release of the TDP from all liens of record and the written consent of all holders of encumbrances on the sending lot other than easements and restrictions, unless the requirement for a release or consent is waived by the Director for good cause. The deed shall be recorded in the King County real property records. When TDP is conveyed to the owner of a receiving lot described in the deed, then unless otherwise expressly stated in the deed or any subsequent instrument conveying the lot or the TDP, the TDP shall pass with the receiving lot whether or not a structure using the TDP shall have been permitted or built prior to any conveyance of the receiving lot. Any subsequent conveyance of TDP previously conveyed to a receiving lot shall require the written consent of all parties holding any interest in or lien on the receiving lot from which the conveyance is made. If the TDP is transferred other than directly from the sending lot to the receiving lot using the TDP, then after the initial transfer, all subsequent transfers also shall be by deed, duly executed, acknowledged and recorded, each referring by King County recording number to the prior deed.

 2. Any person may purchase any TDP that is eligible for transfer by complying with the applicable provisions of this Section 23.58A.018, whether or not the purchaser is then an applicant for a permit to develop real property or is the owner of any potential receiving lot. Any purchaser of the TDP (including any successor or assignee) may use the TDP to obtain floor area above the applicable base height limit or base floor area limit on a receiving lot to the extent that use of TDP is permitted under the Land Use Code provisions applicable with respect to the issuance of permits for development of the project intended to use the TDP. The Director may require, as a condition of processing any permit application using TDP or for the release of any security posted in lieu of a deed for TDP to the receiving lot, that the owner of the receiving lot demonstrate that the TDP has been validly transferred of record to the receiving lot, and that the owner has recorded in the real estate records a notice of the filing of such permit application, stating that the TDP is not available for retransfer.

 3. As a condition to the effective transfer of Landmark TDP, except from a City-owned sending lot, the fee owner of the sending lot shall execute and record an agreement running with the land, in form and content acceptable to, and accepted in writing by, the Director of the Department of Neighborhoods, providing for the rehabilitation and maintenance of the historically significant or other relevant features of the structure or structures on the lot and acknowledging the restrictions on future development resulting from the transfer. The Director may require evidence that each holder of a lien has effectively subordinated the lien to the terms of the agreement, and that any holders of interests in the property have agreed to its terms. To the extent that a Landmark structure on the sending lot, or an historically significant structure on a sending lot in a special review district, the presence of which is a condition to eligibility to transfer TDP under the provisions of the zone, requires restoration or rehabilitation for the long-term preservation of the structure or its historically or architecturally significant features, the Director of the Department of Neighborhoods may require, as a condition to acceptance of the necessary agreement, that the owner of the sending site apply for and obtain a certificate of approval from the Landmarks Preservation Board, or from the Department of Neighborhoods Director after review by the Pioneer Square Preservation Board or International Special Review District Board, as applicable, for the necessary work, or post security satisfactory to the Director of the Department of Neighborhoods for the completion of the restoration or rehabilitation, or both.

 3) For projects using the ESDS, the report will be produced according to the process managed by the Housing Trust Fund Contract Manager for the State of Washington.

 4) For purposes of this subsection 23.90.018.E, if the Director approves a commitment to achieve a substantially equivalent standard, the terms "LEED Silver rating", "Built Green 4-Star" or "ESDS" shall mean such other standard.

 b. Failure to submit a timely report regarding the green building performance rating from an approved independent entity by the date required is a violation of the Land Use Code. The penalty for such violation shall be $500 per day from the date when the report was due to the date it is submitted, without any requirement of notice to the applicant.

 c. Failure to demonstrate, through an independent report as provided in this subsection, full compliance with the applicant's commitment to meet a green building performance requirement, is a violation of the Land Use Code. Each day of noncompliance is a separate violation. The penalty for each violation is determined as follows:

P = CV x 0.01,

where:

P is the penalty;

CV is the Construction Value as set forth on the building permit for the new structure.  d. Failure to comply with the applicant's commitment to meet green building performance requirements is a violation of the Land Use Code independent of the failure to demonstrate compliance; however, such violation shall not affect the right to occupy any chargeable floor area, and if a penalty is paid in the amount determined under subsection 23.90.018.E.2, no additional penalty shall be imposed for the failure to comply with the commitment.

 e. If the Director determines that the report submitted provides satisfactory evidence that the applicant's commitment is satisfied, the Director shall issue a certificate to the applicant so stating. If the Director determines that the applicant did not demonstrate compliance with its commitment to meet green building performance requirements in accordance with this Section 23.90.018, the Director may give notice of such determination, and of the calculation of the penalty due, to the applicant.

 f. If, within 90 days, or such longer period as the Director may allow for good cause, after initial notice from the Director of a penalty due under this subsection, the applicant shall demonstrate, through a supplemental report from the independent entity that provided the initial report, that it has made sufficient alterations or improvements to earn the required green building performance rating, then the penalty owing shall be eliminated. If the applicant does not submit a supplemental report in accordance with this subsection by the date required under this subsection, or if the Director determines that the supplemental report does not demonstrate compliance, then the amount of the penalty as set forth in the Director's original notice shall be final, subject to subsection 23.90.018.C.

 g. Any owner, other than the applicant, of any lot on which the bonus development or extra floor area was obtained or any part thereof, shall be jointly and severally responsible for compliance and liable for any penalty due under this subsection 23.90.018.E.

~~E~~F. Use of Penalties. A subfund shall be established in the City's General Fund to receive revenue from penalties under subsections 23.90.018.B.3, 23.90.018.B.5, and 23.90.018.E ~~of this section~~. Revenue from penalties under ~~that~~these  subsections shall be allocated to activities or incentives to encourage and promote the development of sustainable buildings. The Director shall recommend to the Mayor and City Council how these funds should be allocated.

 Section 71. Subsection M of Section 25.05.675 of the Seattle Municipal Code, which section was last amended by Ordinance 123071, is amended as follows:

 25.05.675 Specific environmental policies.

 * * *

 M. Parking.

 1. Policy Background.

 a. Increased parking demand associated with development projects may adversely affect the availability of parking in an area.

 b. Parking regulations to mitigate most parking impacts and to accommodate most of the cumulative effects of future projects on parking are implemented through the City's Land Use Code. However, in some neighborhoods, due to inadequate off-street parking, streets are unable to absorb parking spillover. The City recognizes that the cost of providing additional parking may have an adverse effect on the affordability of housing.

 2. Policies.

 a. It is the City's policy to minimize or prevent adverse parking impacts associated with development projects.

 b. Subject to the overview and cumulative effects policies set forth in ~~SMC~~ Sections 25.05.665 and 25.05.670, the decisionmaker may condition a project to mitigate the effects of development in an area on parking; provided that:

~~i.~~1) No SEPA authority is provided to mitigate the impact of development on parking availability in the downtown zones;

~~ii.~~2) In ~~the~~ Seattle Mixed (SM) zones, and for residential uses located within ~~the Pike/Pine Urban Center Village,~~ the Capitol Hill/First Hill Urban Center ~~Village~~, the University District Northwest Urban Center Village, ~~and the First Hill Urban Center Village,~~and the Station Area Overlay District, no SEPA authority is provided for the decisionmaker to require more parking than the minimum required by the Land Use Code;

~~iii.~~3) Parking impact mitigation for multifamily development, except in the Alki area, as described in subsection 25.05.675.M.2.c below, may be required only where on-street parking is at capacity, as defined by the Seattle  Department of Transportation or where the development itself would cause on-street parking to reach capacity as so defined.

 c. For the Alki area, as identified on ~~Exhibit 2~~Map B for 23.45.015, a higher number of spaces per unit than is required by SMC Section 23.54.015 may be required to mitigate the adverse parking impacts of specific multifamily projects. Projects that generate a greater need for parking and that are located in places where the street cannot absorb that need -- for example, because of proximity to the Alki Beach Park -- may be required to provide additional parking spaces to meet the building's actual need. In determining that need, the size of the development project, the size of the units and the number of bedrooms in the units shall be considered.

 d. Parking impact mitigation for projects outside of downtown zones may include but is not limited to:

~~i.~~1) Transportation management programs;

~~ii.~~2) Parking management and allocation plans;

~~iii.~~3) Incentives for the use of alternatives to single-occupancy vehicles, such as transit pass subsidies, parking fees, and provision of bicycle parking space;

~~iv.~~4) Increased parking ratios, except for projects located within ~~the~~ Seattle Mixed (SM) zones , and residential uses located in ~~the Pike/Pine Urban Center Village,~~ the Capitol Hill/First Hill Urban Center ~~Village~~, the University District Northwest Urban Center Village, ~~or the First Hill Urban Center Village,~~and the Station Area Overlay District; and

~~v.~~5) Reduced development densities to the extent that it can be shown that reduced parking spillover is likely to result; provided, that parking impact mitigation for multifamily development may not include reduction in development density.

 * * *

 Section 72. The provisions of this ordinance are declared to be separate and severable. The invalidity of any particular provision, or its invalidity as applied in any circumstances, shall not affect the validity of any other provision or the application of the particular provision in other circumstances. To the extent that sections of this ordinance recodify or are incorporated into new or different sections provisions of the Seattle Municipal Code as previously in effect, this ordinance shall be construed to continue such provisions in effect. The repeal of various sections of Title 23 of the Seattle Municipal Code by this ordinance shall not relieve any person of the obligation to comply with the terms and conditions of any permit issued pursuant to the provisions of such Title as in effect prior to such repeal, nor shall it relieve any person or property of any obligations, conditions or restrictions in any agreement or instrument made or granted pursuant to, or with reference to, the provisions of such Title in effect prior to such repeal.

 Section 73. This ordinance is intended to adopt an affordable housing incentive program for certain multifamily zones in accordance with RCW 36.70A.540. To the extent any performance or payment under Section 23.58A.014 as amended by this ordinance may constitute a tax under applicable law, this ordinance enacts that tax pursuant to the authority in RCW 36.70A.540.

 Section 74. Sections 1 through 73 of this ordinance shall take effect 60 days after the effective date of this ordinance.

 Section 75. This ordinance shall take effect and be in force 30 days from and after its approval by the Mayor, but if not approved and returned by the Mayor within 10 days after presentation, it shall take effect as provided by Municipal Code Section 1.04.020.

 Institutions other than public schools which do not meet development standards established in Section 23.45.090 may be permitted in multifamily zones as administrative conditional uses. The provisions of this section shall apply to Major Institution uses as provided in Chapter 23.69, Major Institution Overlay District.

 The following criteria shall be used to evaluate and/or condition the proposals:

 A. Bulk and Siting. In order to accommodate the special needs of the proposed institution, and to better site the facility with respect to its surroundings, the Director may modify the applicable development standards for modulation, landscaping, provision of open space, and structure width, depth and setbacks. In determining whether to allow such modifications, the Director shall balance the needs of the institution against the compatibility of the proposed institution with the residential scale and character of the surrounding area.

 B. Dispersion Criteria. An institution which does not meet the dispersion criteria of Section 23.45.102 may be permitted by the Director upon determination that it would not substantially aggravate parking shortages, traffic safety hazards, and noise in the surrounding residential area.

 C. Noise. The Director may condition the permit in order to mitigate potential noise problems. Measures to be used by the Director for this purpose include, but are not limited to the following: landscaping, sound barriers or fences, mounding or berming, adjustments to yards or the location of refuse storage areas, or parking development standards, design modification and fixing of hours for use of areas.

 D. Transportation Plan.

 1. A transportation plan shall be required for proposed new institutions and for those institutions proposing expansions which are larger than four thousand (4,000) square feet of structure area and/or required to provide twenty (20) or more parking spaces.

 2. The Director shall determine the level of detail to be disclosed in the transportation plan based on the probable impacts and/or scale of the proposed institution. Consideration of the following elements and other similar factors may be required:

 a. Traffic. Number of staff during normal working hours; users, guests and others regularly associated with the institution; level of vehicular traffic generated; traffic peaking characteristics of the institution and the immediate area; likely vehicle use patterns; extent of congestion; types and number of vehicles associated with the use; and mitigating measures to be taken by the applicant;

 b. Parking Area. Number of spaces; extent of screening from public or abutting lots; direction of vehicle light glare; direction of lighting; sources of possible vibration; prevailing direction of exhaust fumes; location of driveway and curb cuts; accessibility and convenience of the parking area; and mitigating measures to be taken by the applicant, such as parking space preferences for carpool or vanpool vehicles and provisions for bicycle racks;

 c. Parking Overflow. Number of vehicles expected to park in the street; percentage of on-street parking supply to be used by the proposed use; opportunities available to share existing parking areas; trends in local area development and mitigating measures to be taken by the applicant;

 d. Safety. Number of driveways which cross pedestrian walkways; location of passenger loading areas;

 e. Availability of Mass Transportation. Bus route location and frequency of service; private transportation programs, including carpools and vanpools, to be provided by the applicant.

 3. The Director may condition a permit to mitigate potential traffic and parking problems. Measures which may be used by the Director for this purpose include, but are not limited to, the following:

 a. Implementing the institution's transportation plan to encourage use of public or private mass transit;

 b. Increasing on-site parking or loading space requirements to reduce overflow of vehicles into the on-street parking supply;

 c. Changing access and location of parking;

 d. Decreasing on-site parking or loading space requirements, if the applicant can demonstrate that less than the required amount of parking is necessary due to the specific features of the institution or the activities and programs it offers. In such cases, the applicant shall enter into an agreement with the Director, specifying the amount of parking required and linking the parking reduction to the features of the institution which justify the reduction. Such parking reductions shall be valid only under the conditions specified, and if those conditions change, the standard requirement shall be satisfied.
