 WHEREAS, the Mayor's 2010 Proposed Budget for the City Light Department assumes an increase in the Department's 2010 electricity rates effective January 1, 2010; and

 Section 1. Section 2 of Ordinance 123032 is amended as follows:

 Section 2. Establishment. An ad hoc City Light Department (Department) Rates Advisory Committee (RAC) is established that will be convened each time the Mayor proposes changes to the Department's base rates, unless that change is the result of an automatic pass through provided for in Section 21.49.

 The RAC shall consist of nine members drawn from among the Department's customers, five of whom shall be nominated by the Mayor and four by the chair of the City Council Committee responsible for oversight of the Department (Chair), all of whom shall be confirmed by the City Council.

 The Chair shall nominate at least one member from each of the residential and small commercial customer groups. The Mayor shall nominate at least one member each from the large commercial or industrial, network, and suburban customer groups.

~~The Mayor, in anticipation of proposing rates, will initiate the process of convening a RAC timely enough to allow confirmation of a RAC by the City Council at least 180 days prior to the formal action by the City Council on the rates.~~The appointments shall end upon adoption of rates by the City Council.

 Members will serve without pay, but may be reimbursed for legitimate expenses incurred to attend meetings. Members may be dismissed by the Chair, after consultation with the other members of the responsible Council Committee, for three consecutive unexcused absences or for other cause.

 Upon the resignation, dismissal, or incapacity of a RAC member, the nominating authority may appoint a replacement to serve the remainder of the member's term.

For all rate proposals proposed to take effect after January 2, 2010, the Mayor, in anticipation of proposing such rates, will initiate the process of convening a RAC timely enough to allow confirmation of the RAC by the City Council at least 90 days prior to formal action by the City Council on the rates.

 Section 2. Section 5 of Ordinance 123032 is amended as follows:

 Section 5. Reporting. The RAC shall keep a written record of its proceedings which shall be a public record. The RAC shall report its findings and recommendations in writing to the Mayor and the Council ~~at least two weeks~~prior to action on the rate legislation by the responsible Council Committee. The RAC shall endeavor to find consensus, but significant disagreements on findings or recommendations should be noted in its written report.

 Section 3. Any act consistent with the authority of this ordinance taken prior to its effective date is hereby ratified and confirmed.

 Section 4. Effective Date. This ordinance shall take effect and be in force thirty (30) days from and after its approval by the Mayor, but if not approved and returned by the Mayor within ten (10) days after presentation, it shall take effect as provided by Municipal Code Section 1.04.020.
