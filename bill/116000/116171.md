 C. Lessee and Lessor desire to extend the Lease, subject to the terms and conditions set forth in this First Amendment (the "First Amendment").

 1. EXTENSION TERM: The term of the Lease is hereby extended for an additional

 five (5) year period, commencing June 1, 2008, and shall expire at midnight on May 31, 2013 (the "Extension Term"). The Extension Term shall be upon the same terms and conditions as set forth in the Lease and the First Amendment, except as otherwise expressly provided herein.
