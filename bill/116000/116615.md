 25.05.675 Specific environmental policies~~.~~

 ***

 C. Drainage.

 1. Policy Background.

 a. Property development and redevelopment often create increased volumes and rates of stormwater runoff, which may cause property damage, safety hazards, nuisance problems and water quality degradation.

 b. Pollution, mechanical damage, excessive flows, and other conditions in drainage basins will increase the rate of down-cutting and/or the degree of turbidity, siltation, habitat destruction, and other forms of pollution in wetlands, riparian corridors and lakes. They may also reduce low flows or low water levels to a level which endangers aquatic or benthic life within these wetlands, riparian corridors and lakes.

 c. The aesthetic quality and educational value of the water and watercourses, as well as the suitability of waters for contact recreation and wildlife habitat, may be destroyed.

 d. Authority provided through the ~~Grading and Drainage Control Ordinance3~~Stormwater Code (Chapters 22.800 through 22.808) and ~~the Environmentally Critical Areas Ordinance~~ Regulations for Environmentally Critical Areas (Chapter 25.09) is intended to achieve mitigation of drainage impacts in most cases, although these ordinances may not anticipate or eliminate all impacts.

 2. Policies.

 a. It is the City's policy to protect wetlands, riparian corridors, lakes, drainage basins, wildlife habitat, slopes, and other property from adverse drainage impacts.

 b. The decisionmaker may condition or deny projects to mitigate their adverse drainage impacts consistent with the Overview Policy set forth in SMC Section 25.05.665; provided, that in addition to projects which meet one ~~(1)~~ or more of the threshold criteria set forth in the Overview Policy, the following may be conditioned or denied:

~~i.~~1) Projects located in environmentally critical areas and areas tributary to them;

~~ii.~~2) Projects located in areas where downstream drainage facilities are known to be inadequate; and

~~iii.~~3) Projects draining into streams identified by the State Department of Fish~~eries or~~and Wildlife as bearing anadromous fish.

 c. To mitigate adverse drainage impacts associated with the projects identified in the policy set forth ~~in subsection C2~~ above in subsection 25.05.675.C.2, projects may be required to provide drainage control measures designed to a higher standard than the design storm specified in the ~~Grading and Drainage Control Ordinance3~~Stormwater Code (Chapters 22.800 through 22.808) and the Environmentally Critical Areas Ordinance. Mitigating measures may include, but are not limited to:

~~i.~~1) Reducing the size or scope of the project;

~~ii.~~2) Requiring landscaping and/or retention of existing vegetation;

~~iii.~~3) Requiring additional drainage control or drainage improvements either on or off site; and

~~iv.~~4) Soil stabilization measures.

 D. Earth.

 1. Policy Background.

 a. Property development and redevelopment sometimes contribute to landslides, accelerated soil creep, settlement and subsidence, and abnormal erosion. They may also be subject to seismic hazards such as strong ground motion and liquefaction.

 b. The ~~Grading and Drainage Control Ordinance3~~ Grading Code (Chapter 22.170) was specifically developed to prevent or minimize impacts resulting from earth fills and excavations and the Environmentally Critical Areas Ordinance was developed to minimize impacts resulting from activity in environmentally critical areas; however, these ordinances may not anticipate or adequately mitigate such impacts in all cases.

 c. Drainage impacts, which are closely related to earth movement hazards, are addressed separately in subsection C of these policies.

 ***

 Section 8. Subsections H and J of Section 25.09.060 of the Seattle Municipal Code, which Section was last amended by Ordinance 122050, are amended as follows:

 25.09.060 General development standards~~.~~

 ***

 H. Best management practices shall be used for all construction activity on parcels with or adjacent to environmentally critical areas or buffers to prevent sediment and other pollutants from entering the riparian corridor watercourses or other fish and wildlife habitat conservation areas on or off the property. Best management practices include, but are not limited to, installation of siltation barriers, diversion measures, slope drains, and structural, vegetative stabilization techniques and other methods prescribed in ~~Title 22, Subtitle VIII~~Chapters 22.800 through 22.808, the Stormwater~~, Grading and Drainage Control~~ Code.

 ***

 J. The site, including developmental coverage and construction activity areas, shall be managed in a manner sufficient to control stormwater and prevent erosion during construction, and shall be revegetated to promote stormwater control and prevent erosion after construction, consistent with ~~Title 22, Subtitle VIII~~Chapters 22.800 through 22.808, the Stormwater~~, Grading and Drainage Control~~ Code.

</td></tr></table> A wetland with a moderate level of function is one that scores 20 to 28 points for habitat function when rated according to Washington State Ecology publication #04-06-025. A wetland with a high level of function for habitat is one that scores of 29 to 36 points for habitat function when rated according to Washington State Ecology publication #04-06-025.  c. Wetlands constructed in upland areas or non-wetland areas by any person for stormwater control, biofiltration or aesthetic purposes are not subject to the wetland buffer requirements of this ~~c~~Chapter. Maintenance activities are not restricted in these types of wetlands.

 2. Development is prohibited in wetland buffers, except as approved by the Director under subsection 25.09.160.D.

 3. The Director may authorize development in a Category IV wetland under ~~one thousand (~~ 1,000 ~~)~~ square feet that does not have the characteristics described in subsection 25.09.160.B. 1.c above, when the Director finds that one of the following measures, which must occur on site, will mitigate wetland function lost by development:

 a. Construct a wetland of equal function to the lost wetland function.

 b. Plant an area of native vegetation equal or greater in size to the area of the developed wetland, and remove invasive species in the area to be planted.

 c. Construct a bioengineered/infiltration facility, such as a ~~bioswale,~~~~stormwater or infiltration planter,~~ bioretention cell or bioretention planter, that replicates the hydrologic and/or water quality benefit of the developed wetland. This facility shall be designed according to the requirements of ~~Title 22, Subtitle VIII~~Chapters 22.800 through 22.808, Stormwater ~~, Grading and Drainage Control~~ Code and associated Director's Rules .

 B. Development Standards for Shoreline Habitat.

 ***

 4. Buffers.

 a. Shoreline habitat has a 100 foot~~one hundred foot (100')~~ buffer from the ordinary high water mark.

 b. Bioengineered solutions, such as using plants or other approved natural material, to stabilize the shoreline are allowed in the buffer, provided they are allowed under Title 23, including ~~c~~ Chapter 23.60, the Shoreline Master Program.

 c. Other development for water dependent and water related uses is prohibited in the buffer, except when:

~~(~~ 1) The development is allowed under Title 23, including ~~c~~Chapter 23.60, the Shoreline Master Program; and

~~(~~ 2) no vegetation is removed, the amount of impervious surface is not increased, and no surface that is permeable by water at the time of the application will be covered with an impervious surface so that impervious surface will be closer to the ordinary high water mark; or

~~(~~ 3) if any of the actions described in subsection 25.09.200.B.4.c.2~~c(2) above~~ occur and that action impacts the ecologic function of the shoreline, those impacts are mitigated as set out in subsection 25.09.200.B.4.e below.

 If the standards in subsections 25.09.200.B.4.c.1 and 25.09.200.B.4.c.2~~c(1) and (2)~~ are met, then the application is not subject to the application submittal requirements in Section 25.09.330 and the general development standards in Section 25.09.060.

 d. Other development for non-water dependent and non- water related uses is prohibited in the buffer, except when:

~~(~~ 1) The development is allowed under Title 23, including ~~c~~Chapter 23.60, the Shoreline Master Program; and

~~(~~ 2) for non-residential uses

~~(~~ a) the lot was in existence before May 9, 2006~~the effective date of Ordinance 122050~~; and

~~(~~ b) the development is 25 feet~~twenty five feet (25')~~ or more from the ordinary high water mark unless the development is allowed in the shoreline habitat under Title 23, including ~~c~~Chapter 23.60, the Shoreline Master Program; and

~~(~~ c) ~~(i)~~ i. no vegetation is removed, impervious surface is not increased and no net loss of ecological function of the critical area or buffer from other actions occurs; or

~~(ii)~~ ii. if any of the actions described in subsection 25.09.200.B.4.d.2.c.i~~d(2)(c)(i)~~ above occur, all impacts on the ecological function are mitigated as set out in subsection 25.09.200.B.4.e below; or

~~(~~ 3) for residential uses the residence is 25 feet ~~twenty five feet (25')~~ or more from the ordinary high water mark

~~(~~ a) and no vegetation is removed, impervious surface is not increased and no net loss of ecological function of the critical area or buffer from other actions occurs; or

~~(~~ b) if any of the actions described in subsection 25.09.200.B.4.d.3.a~~d(3)(a)~~ above occur, all impacts on the ecological function are mitigated as set out in subsection 25.09.200.B.4.e below.

 e. Mitigation.

~~(~~ 1) Mitigation must prevent net loss of ecological function. Mitigation must achieve the equivalent ecologic functions as the conditions existing in the shoreline habitat buffer at the time of development. Mitigation under this ~~s~~Section is not intended to duplicate mitigation for the same ecologic function that is required under other City regulations or under state and federal permits. The permit condition most protective of the ecologic function shall be enforced.

~~(~~ 2) For the purpose of this ~~s~~S ection, mitigation is action that replaces ecological functions lost as a result of a project impact. Depending on the type of lost ecological function these include:

~~(~~ a) providing habitat, or

~~(~~ b) creating new pervious ground or

~~(~~ c) replicates the function of the pervious ground through methods that are engineered and designed according to the requirements of Chapters 22.800 through 22.808~~Title 22, Subtitle VIII~~, Stormwater~~, Grading and Drainage Control~~ Code.

 ***

 6. Streets.

 a. Existing public or private streets are excluded from these buffer regulations, provided that if the provisions of Chapters 22.800 through 22.808~~Title 22, Subtitle VIII~~, the Stormwater~~, Grading and Drainage Control~~ Code apply, the Director shall require adequate stormwater detention to prevent harm from the street to habitat and to keep degradation of water quality for habitat to a minimum.

 b. New streets are allowed when the following criteria are met:

~~(~~ 1) the street is allowed under Title 23, including ~~c~~Chapter 23.60, the Shoreline Master Program; and

~~(~~ 2) no vegetation is removed, impervious surface is not increased, and no net loss of ecological function of the critical area or buffer from other actions occurs; or

~~(~~ 3) if the actions described in subsection 25.09.200.B.6.b.2~~(b)(2) above~~ occur, any impacts on the ecological function are mitigated as set out in subsection 25.09.200.B. 4.e above.

 7. The following provisions apply to all parcels containing shoreline habitat and buffers to prevent impacts to the habitat and buffer:

 a. Any increases in surface runoff from development shall be kept to a minimum, and surface water run off shall be controlled, treated and released so that receiving water quality and any shore properties and features are not adversely affected. Control measures may include, but are not limited to, dikes, catch basins or settling ponds, interceptor drains and planted buffers. Allowable means to achieve this include bioswales, catch basin filters, and other methods prescribed in  Chapters 22.800 through 22.808~~Title 22, Subtitle VIII~~, the Stormwater~~, Grading and Drainage Control~~ Code.

 b. Pavement in the habitat and buffer shall be kept to a minimum and permeable surfacing, where practicable, shall be used to keep surface water accumulation and runoff into the habitat and buffer to a minimum. Recommended methods are found in Chapters 22.800 through 22.808~~Title 22, Subtitle VIII~~, Stormwater~~, Grading and Drainage Control~~ Code. Permeable surfaces include, but are not limited to, porous asphalt, concrete, brick, or pavers; or plastic confinement systems with grass or gravel filler.
