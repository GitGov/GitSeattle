 AN ORDINANCE relating to the rates, terms, and conditions for the use and sale of electricity supplied by the City Light Department; establishing a new power revenue adjustment mechanism; and adding a new Section 21.49.086 to the Seattle Municipal Code.

 WHEREAS, Ordinance 120247, passed by the City Council on January 29, 2001, established an automatic Bonneville Power Administration (BPA) cost adjustment, which was reaffirmed and amended most recently in Ordinance 122282 when it was passed by the City Council on November 20, 2006; and

 WHEREAS, Resolution 30428, passed by the City Council on December 10, 2001, established the financial policy for City Light that net revenue available to fund capital requirements in each calendar year should be positive with a probability of at least 95%, taking into account the variability of cash flows resulting from the uncertainty of water conditions, market prices and system load; and

 WHEREAS, Resolution 30761, passed by the City Council on May 2, 2005, affirmed the policy described above and added the financial policy that rates should also be set to ensure a first and second lien debt service coverage ratio of 2.0; and

 WHEREAS, Ordinance 122282, passed by the City Council on November 20, 2006, established comprehensive rates, terms, and conditions for the use and sale of electricity supplied by City Light; and

 WHEREAS, Resolution 30933 adopted by the City Council on November 20, 2006, established long-term rate setting objectives and electric rate policies for City Light; and

 WHEREAS, these policies were established with the intent of maintaining financial strength in light of the financial and operational uncertainty associated with City Light's reliance on wholesale revenue; and

 WHEREAS, wholesale market sales of excess power are a major source of revenue for City Light, and due to the uncertain nature of its two primary drivers, hydroelectric generation and market conditions, this revenue is both greatly variable and largely uncontrollable; and

 WHEREAS, the improved financial stability afforded by the rate adjustment mechanism proposed in this ordinance enables a revision of financial policies such that the net revenue available to fund the capital requirements confidence target established by Resolution 30428 may be retired, and the debt service coverage target established by Resolution 30761 may be lowered from 2.0 to 1.6-1.8 and still demonstrate a comparable level of financial prudence; and

 WHEREAS, in order to reduce the need for a large rate increase in 2010, City Light has proposed an ordinance that would revise the utility's financial policies such that rates would be set to achieve first and second lien debt service coverage of 1.6 in 2010, 1.7 in 2011, and 1.8 in 2012 and thereafter; and

 WHEREAS, the City Council has reviewed the power revenue adjustment mechanism proposal set out herein, and has determined that a lower retail rate coupled with revised financial policies and this power revenue adjustment mechanism is in the best interest of City Light and its customers; NOW THEREFORE,

 BE IT ORDAINED BY THE CITY OF SEATTLE AS FOLLOWS:

 Section 1. A new Section 21.49.086 is added to the Seattle Municipal Code as follows:

 SMC 21.49.086 Power Revenue Adjustment Mechanism

 A. Definitions:

 1. Adjustment Period: the three-month period starting one month after the associated quarter (e.g., the first Adjustment Period would be May 1 through July 31).

 2. Power Revenue Adjustment Mechanism (PRAM): a method of periodically adjusting retail customer energy charges depending on how actual wholesale power revenue differs from the PRAM Baseline, if the magnitude of the difference exceeds the PRAM Threshold.

 3. PRAM Adjustment: a cents per kWh credit or charge applied to retail customer energy charges.

 4. PRAM Adjustment Maximum: a cap on the magnitude of the PRAM Adjustment to protect retail customers from extreme fluctuations in rates in any Adjustment Period. The PRAM Adjustment Maximum shall be $0.01 per kWh.

 5. PRAM Balance: a calculation used to track deviations between forecast and actual wholesale power revenue and the amount of the deviations disbursed to or collected from customers through PRAM Adjustments.

 6. PRAM Baseline: the amount of net wholesale power revenue projected by Quarter and adopted by City Council by ordinance.

 7. PRAM Threshold: a range of the PRAM Balance for which no PRAM Adjustment would be implemented for the following quarter. The PRAM Threshold shall initially be set at $10,000,000, meaning that no PRAM Adjustment would be made unless the PRAM Balance was more than $10,000,000 or less than -$10,000,000.

 8. Quarter: a three-month period, with the First Quarter being January 1 through March 31.

 9. Actual Net Wholesale Power Revenue: the net revenue received by City Light from sales of surplus energy in the wholesale market. Actual Net Wholesale Power Revenue will be determined using month-end accounting statements. Actual Net Wholesale Power Revenue will equal gross wholesale power sales (sum of Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) accounting codes 44700, 44701 and 44714) minus wholesale power purchases (sum of FERC accounting codes 55400, 55401, 55414).

 B. Effective January 1, 2010, the PRAM Baseline will be:

 First Quarter (January -March): $42,258,889

 Second Quarter (April-June): $30,767,051

 Third Quarter (July-September): $25,115,206

 Fourth Quarter (October-December): $21,832,225

 C. Once month-end accounting statements are available at the end of each quarter, starting with the first quarter of 2010, City Light will calculate the difference between the Actual Net Wholesale Power Revenue and the PRAM Baseline for that period and this difference will be added to the PRAM Balance (i.e., a negative result from the calculation would mean that actuals were lower than the Baseline).

 D. If the PRAM Balance is within the PRAM Threshold, no credit or charge will be added to retail rates for the next Adjustment Period, and the PRAM Balance will be carried forward to the subsequent Adjustment Period.

 E. Following a one-month lag from the end of each quarter, starting with the first quarter of 2010, if the PRAM Balance is outside the PRAM Threshold, the amount in the PRAM Balance will be disbursed to, or collected from, retail customers by adding a PRAM Adjustment to all energy sales to customers during the associated three-month Adjustment Period. The PRAM Adjustment will be calculated by dividing the PRAM Balance by the most current forecast of retail sales. For example, the PRAM Balance as of the end of March 2010 will be disbursed to, or collected from, retail customers through retail kWh sales in May-July 2010. The amount of the PRAM Balance disbursed to, or collected from, customers shall be reflected in the PRAM Balance once the credits or charges are in place. In no case will the PRAM Adjustment exceed the PRAM Adjustment Maximum.

 F. The PRAM Adjustment will be increased or decreased for changes in city and state effective tax rates.

 G. Each PRAM Adjustment shall only be in effect for one three-month period; in other words, a PRAM Adjustment shall not be added to another PRAM Adjustment. If the entire PRAM Balance cannot be disbursed or collected because the credit or charge reaches the PRAM Adjustment Maximum, then the remainder of the PRAM Balance will be carried over to the subsequent Adjustment Period. The PRAM Balance will be carried over between calendar years and will remain until it is completely disbursed or collected from retail customers. The PRAM Balance will also be carried over when a new PRAM Baseline is set.

 H. The PRAM Adjustment will be implemented as a decrease or increase in the energy rates (i.e., rates per kWh) of all rate schedules that include energy rates, and a decrease or increase in the energy (kWh assumed) portion of Schedules T, P, and F. The PRAM Adjustment will be an equal energy credit or charge (rates per kWh) on all customer classes except the Residential Rate Assistance classes. The PRAM Adjustment will decrease or increase equally first block and second block charges in all residential rate schedules, peak and off-peak energy rates in large and high demand general service rate schedules, and the single energy charge in small and medium general service rate schedules. Likewise, the same credit or charge per kWh will decrease or increase the energy portion of Schedules T, P, and F.

 I. For customers in the Residential Rate Assistance classes (Schedules REC/RLC, REB/RLB, REH/RLH, RES/RLS and RET/RLT), the PRAM Adjustment will be forty percent (40%) of the rate adjustment of other classes.

 Section 2. This ordinance shall take effect and be in force on the later of January 1, 2010 or thirty (30) days from and after its approval by the Mayor, but if not approved and returned by the Mayor within ten (10) days after presentation, it shall take effect on the later of January 1, 2010, or as provided by Municipal Code Section 1.04.020. The first PRAM Adjustment shall not be before four months after this ordinance takes effect.
