 Version #4b

 Agreement Between

 the City of Seattle and

 the Seattle Chinatown International District

 Preservation and Development Authority

 Regarding Funding for a New Dental Care Facility

 This Agreement is made by and between the City of Seattle ("the City") and the Seattle Chinatown International District Preservation and Development Authority ("PDA") this _________ day of __________, 2008.

 Whereas, in 2008 the City of Seattle allocated $750,000 in the 2008 Adopted Budget for the construction of a new dental clinic in Seattle's International District; and

 Whereas, the PDA is the owner of the project site ("Property"), more particularly described as: Lots 3 to 8, inclusive, Block 3, Terry's 5th Addition to the City of Seattle, according to the plat thereof recorded in Volume 2 of Plats, page 55, in King County, Washington; except the south 12 feet of said Lots 6, 7 and 8, condemned in King County Superior Court Cause No. 52652 for widening Dearborn Street as provided by Ordinance Number 13320 of the City of Seattle; and except the east 112 feet thereof condemned in King County Superior Court Cause No. 600725 for Primary State Highway 1-situate in the City of Seattle, County of King, State of Washington; and

 Whereas, the funds were awarded to International Community Health Services (ICHS) and subsequently conveyed to the PDA acting as the project developer for the development of the new dental clinic on behalf of ICHS, and

 Whereas the new dental clinic is to be located on property and in facilities owned by the PDA, and

 Whereas, PDA intends to develop, construct, and lease the new dental clinic to ICHS ("Project"), on terms mutually agreeable to ICHS and the PDA, for the purpose of providing dental services to low- and moderate-income persons; and

 Whereas, ICHS agrees to lease the new dental clinic from the PDA on terms mutually agreeable to ICHS and the PDA, to provide services to low- and moderate-income persons; and

 Whereas, the City desires that dental services be accessible to low- and moderate-income persons at the newly-constructed facility for a period of no less than 10 (ten) years after completion of the clinic;

 Now, therefore, the City and the PDA agree to the following.

 Section One

 The City, acting through its Human Services Department, will reimburse, subject to the terms and conditions detailed herein, the PDA for the cost of tenant improvements of up to a maximum of Seven Hundred Fifty thousand dollars and no cents ($750,000.00) from non- federal sources for the construction of a dental care facility to serve low- to moderate-income persons. Such facility will be located in the building commonly known as ID Village Square in Seattle's International District and will contain a minimum of eight functioning dental chairs from which services will be provided. The term "tenant improvements" includes mechanical, electrical, plumbing, and construction work needed to change the infrastructure of the existing ID Village Square space into a functioning dental clinic and including demolition of existing structures if necessary. The term "tenant improvements" specifically excludes construction management fees and all fees charged by any party in relation to this project. Funding is for tenant improvement costs only and does not include funding for equipment or operating costs.

 Section Two

 The funding available in this Agreement shall be available only to reimburse costs incurred from July 1, 2008 through July 31, 2009.

 Section Three

 The PDA shall develop the dental clinic in accordance with the Statement of Goals and Performance Standards (including compliance through the duration of the continuing use period) attached hereto as

 Exhibit A and incorporated herein by this reference. The City has no obligation to disburse any of the funds except in strict accordance with the terms of this Agreement. The PDA shall use these proceeds strictly in accordance with the Budget, which is attached hereto as Exhibit B and incorporated herein by this reference, and for other costs approved in writing by the City. Any balance undisbursed upon completion of the project and full payment therefore shall remain the property of the City and may be used by the City for any other City purpose.

 Section Four

 To ensure continued compliance with the use requirements imposed by the City that the dental clinic be used for the benefit of low- and moderate-income persons for a period of not less than ten years, starting from the issuance of a Certificate of Occupancy from the City, a separate agreement of even date will be entered into by the PDA, the City, and International Community Health Services outlining the intent of all parties that ICHS shall lease the new dental facility and provide dental services to low- and moderate-income clients for a period of not less than ten years. Funds will not be disbursed to the PDA unless and until this separate agreement has been signed. If that agreement between the PDA and ICHS shall be terminated for any reason prior to the completion of the ten years, the City shall have the right to substitute a replacement dental provider on substantially similar terms and conditions for the remaining term of that agreement.

 Section Five

 A. Funds shall be disbursed by the City no more frequently than monthly, solely in payment for documented project expenses in accordance with the Budget, attached as Exhibit A. The PDA shall submit a draw request with supporting documentation not later than ten (10) days after the end of each calendar month. Disbursements shall be conditioned upon the PDA's compliance with the terms of this Agreement and, at the City's option, the City's inspection and approval of completed work. In addition, funds shall not be disbursed for construction (which term shall include tenant improvements and demolition work for all purposes hereunder, to the extent the project includes such work) or materials until the City has received project plans, specifications and final cost estimates acceptable to the City; the PDA has provided evidence satisfactory to the City of all necessary building permits; the PDA has provided an executed construction contract satisfactory to the City; and the PDA has provided the City with evidence satisfactory to the City of sufficient financing to complete construction. Disbursement shall ordinarily occur within three (3) weeks of the PDA's written request unless the City notifies the PDA of a deficiency in its request. The City shall have the right to withhold as retention ten percent (10%) from each disbursement for construction or materials until such time as the project has been completed, the PDA has delivered a copy of a Certificate of Occupancy for the facility (or other evidence of final approval under construction permits, if no Certificate of Occupancy is required) to the City, final lien releases have been obtained from all contractors, subcontractors and material suppliers, and all documentation regarding compliance with the requirements of this Agreement has been submitted in form satisfactory to the City. Retention is withheld for the protection of the City, and is not for the benefit of any third parties. Disbursements may be made, at the City's discretion, by checks payable to both the PDA and the contractor, supplier or other person entitled to payment for services or materials in connection with the project.

 B. Prior to the first disbursement of funds, if so requested by the City, the PDA shall furnish the City, at the PDA's expense evidence acceptable to the City that fee title to the Property is vested in the PDA.

 C. The following shall be conditions precedent to the City's obligation to make each disbursement of funds requested by the PDA:

 (1) The PDA shall be in full compliance with all provisions of this Agreement, including without limitation reporting requirements.

 (2) The PDA shall not have received notice to the effect that the PDA is in breach of, is in default under, has failed to comply with, or has failed to satisfy a condition of any of the other financing documents or any permit for the project, unless all matters cited in such notice have been cured to the satisfaction of all parties involved, without adverse effect upon the PDA or the project, prior to the request for a disbursement of funds hereunder, or the PDA has demonstrated to the satisfaction of the City that there is no basis for any such notice.

 (3) There shall be no legal or administrative action pending seeking to enjoin or prevent the project or operation of the Property as contemplated in this Agreement, or contesting the legality of any permit for the project or of the arrangements contemplated by this Agreement or any of the other financing documents, and no order, judgment, ruling, finding or determination of any court or administrative agency shall have been issued or made prohibiting, restraining, declaring unlawful, creating reasonable uncertainty as to the legality of, or otherwise adversely affecting any of the following: the project, the operation of the Property as contemplated in this Agreement, or the funding of the project under this Agreement or any Other Financing Documents.

 (5) All contractors and subcontractors for the project shall have provided evidence satisfactory to the PDA that they have paid applicable State prevailing wages as required by law and shall be in full compliance with the terms of their respective contracts, including without limitation all provisions of such contracts required to be included in accordance with the terms hereof.

 (6) The PDA shall have submitted to the City such other documents and materials as are required pursuant to the terms of this Agreement or that the City may reasonably require in order to demonstrate compliance with the conditions to disbursement hereunder. Such documents shall include a certificate in the form prescribed by the City, signed by the PDA or its agent, by the general contractor and, if so requested by the City, by the project architect, as to the percentage of completion and the conformity of work to the plans and specifications.

 (7) The improvements on the Property shall not have been damaged by fire or other casualty.

 D. If any condition of this Agreement requires the submission of evidence of the existence (or non-existence) of a specified fact or facts, then such condition shall be deemed to require also the actual existence (or non-existence, as the case may be), of such fact or facts. The City shall, at all times, be free independently to establish to its satisfaction, and in its absolute discretion, such existence (or non-existence).

 E. All conditions to disbursement are for the benefit of the City and, subject to applicable law, may be waived in the City's discretion, but no such waiver for purposes of any disbursement shall be construed to waive any condition with respect to any other disbursements.

 Section Six

 The PDA shall complete all improvements contemplated by this Agreement in accordance with plans, specifications, and the Budget approved by the City and all requirements of applicable laws, Codes, ordinances and permits. No change (other than de minimis changes) in the Budget or approved plans and specifications shall be made (and no change shall be incorporated in any Project construction) without the City's advance consent in writing. The City shall not be responsible for any additional costs resulting from change orders or any other cause. Project construction shall begin by the date stated in Exhibit A and the PDA will cause the work to be prosecuted with diligence and continuity so as to complete the Project in accordance with the requirements of this Agreement on or before the completion date stated in Exhibit A.

Any interruption that could reasonably have been avoided by the PDA shall not be deemed a cause beyond the control of the PDA. In any event, the PDA shall be in breach of this Section if for any reasons (including Force Majeure), either (i) the aggregate of all periods when construction is not carried on, or is discontinued, after the date when construction is required to commence under this Section, is more than sixty (60) calendar days, or (ii) the Project is not completed within ninety (90) calendar days after the date for completion in Exhibit A. TIME IS OF THE ESSENCE of this Agreement.

 The PDA shall immediately notify the City in writing of any interruption of work on the Project or any event or circumstance that reasonably may be expected to prevent completion of the Project or to delay the commencement or completion, or both, of work on the Project past the respective dates stated in Exhibit A. Neither the City's receipt of any such notice, nor any lack of response to any such notice, shall waive or extend any deadline or requirement in this Agreement.

 B. The PDA shall maintain an effective system of control over and accountability for all funds and property and make sure they are used solely for authorized purposes. All financial records and fiscal control systems shall be maintained in a manner to meet the approval of the City and the Washington State Auditor.

 C. The PDA shall inform the City promptly of any funds allocated to the PDA that the PDA anticipates will not be expended during the term of this Agreement and permit reassignment of such funds to other agencies.

All of the requirements and remedies in all of the Agreement are cumulative. This Agreement shall be binding upon PDA and its successors and assigns and shall inure to the benefit of the PDA, the City, and the City's successors and assigns.

No permission, consent, or approval of the City contained herein or given pursuant to any terms of this Agreement is, or shall be construed as, a representation or assurance that the matter permitted, consented to or approved complies with any other agreements or with applicable laws, regulations, ordinances or codes, nor shall any such permission, consent or approval be construed to authorize any failure to comply with any of the foregoing.

 Section Sixteen

 A. Equal Opportunity. The PDA shall comply, and require its contractors and subcontractors to comply, with the City's Fair

 Employment Practices ordinance, SMC Chapter 14.04. The PDA agrees to the following excerpted from Seattle Municipal Code Section 14.04.020, as amended:

 "It is declared to be the policy of the City, in the exercise of its police powers for the protection of the public health, safety, and general welfare, and for the maintenance of peace and good government, to assure equal opportunity to all persons, free from restrictions because of race, color, sex, marital status, sexual orientation, gender identity, political ideology, age, creed, religion, ancestry, national origin, or the presence of any sensory, mental or physical disability."

 B. Non-discrimination and Affirmative Efforts in Contracting. Notwithstanding any other provision in this Agreement:

 (1) General: The City is encouraged when contractors use creative and innovative efforts to ensure that all contracting parties bidding on City funded or City administered contracts have an equal opportunity to participate. The City does not require any minimum level of women- and minority-owned business enterprise (WMBE) subcontractor participation as a condition of awarding any contract. While the City may no longer require WMBE utilization, the City does require that all City funded contracting be done in a nondiscriminatory manner.

 (2) Non-Discrimination: The PDA shall not create, and shall not permit contractors or bidders to create, barriers to open and fair opportunities for WMBEs to participate in contracts for the Project, and to obtain or compete for contracts and subcontracts as sources of supplies, equipment, construction and services. The PDA shall not, in considering offers from and doing business with contractors and suppliers, discriminate on the basis of race, color, creed, religion, ethnicity, sex, age, national origin, marital status, sexual orientation, or the presence of any mental or physical disability in an otherwise qualified disabled person.

 (3) Record-Keeping: The PDA shall maintain, for at least twelve (12) months after completion of the Project, all bids or proposals from general contractors for the Project, and relevant records and information necessary to document levels of utilization of WMBEs and other businesses as subcontractors and suppliers on the Project. The PDA shall require that its general contractor maintain and provide to the City on request all written quotes, bids, estimates, or proposals submitted to the contractor by all businesses seeking to participate as subcontractors or suppliers in the Project. The City shall have the right to inspect and copy such records. The PDA and its general contractor shall comply with all record-keeping requirements set forth in any federal rules, regulations or statutes included or referenced in this Agreement or the contract documents.

 (4) Affirmative Efforts to Utilize WMBEs: The City encourages the utilization of minority owned businesses ("MBEs") and women-owned businesses ("WBEs") (collectively, "WMBEs"), in contracts funded by the City. The City encourages, and the PDA shall encourage with respect to the Project, the following practices to open competitive opportunities for WMBEs:

 (i) Attending a pre-bid or pre-solicitation conference, if scheduled by the City or the PDA, to provide project information and to inform WMBEs of contracting and subcontracting opportunities.

 (ii) Placing all qualified WMBEs attempting to do business in the City on solicitation lists, and providing written notice of subcontracting opportunities to WMBEs capable of performing the work, including without limitation all businesses on any list provided by

 the City, in sufficient time to allow such businesses to respond to the written solicitations.

 (iii) Breaking down total requirements into smaller tasks or quantities, where economically feasible, in order to permit maximum participation by small businesses including WMBEs.

 (iv) Establishing delivery schedules, where the requirements of this contract permit, that encourage participation by WMBEs.

 (v) Providing WMBEs that express interest with adequate and timely information about plans, specifications, and requirements of the contract.

 (vi) Utilizing the services of available minority community organizations, minority contractor groups, local minority assistance offices, the City, and other organizations that provide assistance in the recruitment and placement of WMBEs.

 (5) Fair Contracting Practices. Each party is required to comply with the Fair Contracting Practices Ordinance of The City of Seattle (Ordinance 119601), as amended. Conduct made unlawful by that ordinance constitutes a breach of contract. Engaging in an unfair contracting practice may also result in the imposition of a civil fine or forfeiture under the Seattle Criminal Code as well as various civil remedies.

 (6) Sanctions for Violation: Any violation of any mandatory provision of this subsection C (last sentence of paragraph (1), and paragraphs (2), (3), and (5 shall be a material breach of contract for which the PDA may be subject to damages and sanctions provided for by contract and by applicable law. The PDA's contract with its general contractor shall provide that the contractor may be subject to damages and sanctions for any violation of the provisions of this Section requiring performance by the contractor, and that the City is an intended beneficiary of such contract with respect to those provisions.

 (7) Additional or Modified Procedures. The PDA shall consult with HSD prior to any contractor selection process and shall comply with any additional or modified procedures that HSD may prescribe, consistent with applicable law, to assure access to contracting and subcontracting opportunities.

 C. Hiring. Construction contracts and subcontracts for the Project shall include language encouraging, consistent with the foregoing nondiscrimination requirements, contractors and subcontractors to make employment opportunities available to female, minority and economically disadvantaged workers, and to hire people who are homeless. Nothing herein shall require or authorize any discrimination or preferential treatment contrary to applicable law.

 D. Compliance. The PDA shall require compliance with those provisions of this section that are mandatory requirements for contractors in every contract for construction work in connection with the Property, will take appropriate action upon a finding that the contractor is in violation of any of those requirements, and will not let any contract unless the contractor has first provided the PDA with a preliminary statement of ability to comply with those requirements.

 Section Seventeen

 All construction work on the Project shall be bid competitively. Contractors' qualifications shall be subject to review and approval by the City prior to the commencement of construction, and the City shall have the right to reject any contractors it deems unqualified. The City may, subject to any applicable requirements of state or federal law, permit prequalification of contractors to establish a defined list of contractors for competitive bidding. Bids shall be opened publicly, either at the offices of HSD or at another location approved in writing by the City.

 Section Eighteen

 No portion of the proceeds of this Agreement shall be used for any partisan political activity or to further the election or defeat of any candidate for public office or to influence the approval or defeat of any ballot issue or legislation.

 Section Nineteen

 No person shall, as a condition to receiving services at the dental clinic, be required to secure a membership in the PDA or an affiliated organization or be solicited to attend a religious service or subjected to religious instruction; nor shall any person be subjected to discrimination on account of a failure to participate in such PDA activities.

 Section Twenty

 No person employed on the work covered by this Agreement shall be discharged or in any way discriminated against because s/he has filed any complaint, or instituted or caused to be instituted any proceeding, or has testified or is about to testify in any proceeding under or relating to the labor standards applicable hereunder to the employer.
