 C. The fees for the following special hazards permits are established in Schedule C. See Table 22.602.045C.

 Special Hazards Permits.

 Fees for special hazards permits are established in Schedule C (See Table 22.602.045 C). In some cases these fees are based on the quantity of hazardous material stored and/or handled at the site and the relative risk posed by each material.

 1. Definitions:

 a. "Quantity Range Number" as established in the Quantity Range Table below, is a number between 1 and 2 that is assigned to a hazard category based upon the amount of hazardous material located at the site.

 QUANTITY RANGE SOLIDS LIQUIDS GASES NUMBER (Pounds) (Gallons) (Cu. Ft.)

 1 0-550 0-55 0-1,000

 1.25 >550 - 5,500 >55 - 550 >1,000 - 5,000

 1.5 >5,500 - 27,500 >550 - 2,750 >5,000 - 50,000

 1.75 >27,500 - 55,000 >2,750 - 5,500 >50,000 - 100,000

 2 >55,000 >5,500 >100,000

 b. "Assigned Risk Factor" as established below, is a number between 1 and 1.5 assigned to each hazard class and category of hazardous material indicating the relative hazard posed by materials in that hazard category and the potential nature of controls required by the Fire Code.

 Hazard Class Assigned Hazard Class Assigned Risk Risk Factor Factor

 Aerosol products 1.3 Liquid petroleum gas 1.4

 Cellulose nitrate 1.3 Magnesium 1.3

 Combustible fiber 1.2 Organic peroxides

 Combustible liquids Unclassified 1.5

 Class II 1.2 Class I 1.4

 Class III-A 1.1 Class II 1.3

 Class III-B 1.0 Class III 1.2

 Compressed gases Class IV 1.0

 Highly toxic 1.5 Oxidizers

 Pyrophoric 1.4 Class 4 1.5

 Flammable 1.4 Class 3 1.4

 Unstable 1.4 Class 2 1.2

 Oxidizing 1.4 Class 1 1.1

 Toxic 1.3 Pyrophoric liquids and 1.3 solids

 Corrosive 1.3 Toxic liquids and 1.2 solids

 Corrosive Liquids and 1.1 Unstable (reactive) liquids and Solids solids

 Cryogenic Fluids 1.3 Class 4 1.5

 Explosives 1.5 Class 3 1.4

 Fireworks 1.4 Class 2 1.3

 Flammable liquids, 1.4 Class 1 1.0 Class I

 Flammable solids 1.3 Water-reactive materials

 Highly toxic liquids 1.5 Class 3 1.5 and solids

 Class 2 1.3

 Class 1 1.0

 c. "Fixed permit cost" is the minimum cost for the Seattle Fire Department to issue a hazardous material permit. The fixed permit cost is One hundred eighty-one Dollars ($181.00) ~~One hundred Fifty-two Dollars~~~~$152.00)~~.

 d. "Base permit fee" is determined by multiplying the sum of the products of the quantity range number and assigned risk factor for each hazard class by the fixed permit cost divided by 1.1 and is represented by the following equation:

 Base permit fee = [E (Q1)(R1) + (Q2)(R2) . . ..] [F/1.1]

 Where: Q = The quantity range number.

 R = The assigned risk factor. F = The fixed permit cost $181.00~~$152.00~~.

 When an individual material has multiple hazards, only the hazard presented by the hazard class that has been assigned the highest risk factor shall be considered in the fee calculation.

 Example:

 XYZ Company stores fifty (50) gallons of gasoline and two hundred (200) gallons of 50% nitric acid. Gasoline is classified as a Class I flammable liquid which has an assigned risk factor of 1.4. Nitric acid (50%) is classified as both a corrosive liquid and a Class 2 oxidizer. Because 50% nitric acid presents two separate hazards (corrosive and Class 2 oxidizer) only the Class 2 oxidizer hazard is considered in the fee calculation because it has an assigned risk factor of 1.2 compared to the 1.1 risk factor assigned to corrosives.

 Base permit fee = [(1)(1.4)flammable + (1.25)(1.2)Class 2 oxidizer] [$181.00~~152.00~~/1.1]

 Base permit fee = $477.20~~400.73~~

 Schedule C

 Table 22.602.045 C Special hazards permits

 Schedule C fee worksheet- based permits shall be renewed at one-half thepermit origination fee or $181.00, which is the minimum renewal fee, whicheveris greater.

Schedule C flat-fee permits which had been grandfathered at below market ratepermit fees under prior fee schedules will increase 25 percent annuallybeginning in 2009 until such time as they reach parity with renewal ratesidentified in the current Schedule C. ~~originating on or after January 1, 2005 shall be renewed at one-half the~~~~permit origination fee, but not less than $152.00. Schedule C fee worksheet-~~~~based permits originating prior to January 1, 2005 shall be renewed at 1.33~~~~times the renewal rate in effect in 2004, but not less than $120.00. Effective~~~~January 1, 2006, Schedule C fee worksheet- based permits originating prior to~~~~January 1, 2005 shall be renewed at 1.33 times the renewal rate in effect in~~~~2004, but not less than $152.00.~~
