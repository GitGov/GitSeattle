 Section 8. Effective January 1, 2009, Section 5.45.060 of the Seattle Municipal Code is hereby repealed.

 Section 9. A new section 5.45.085 is hereby added to the Seattle Municipal Code as follows:

 5.45.085 Related person transactions.

 A. When the relationship between related, controlled or affiliated persons is such that the gross income from business activities between such persons is not indicative of the market value of the activities or transactions, the Director shall determine the market value upon which the Seattle business license tax shall be levied.

 The purpose of this section is to ensure taxpayers clearly reflect their true gross income attributable to business activities or transactions between related, controlled or affiliated persons, and to prevent the avoidance of taxes in regards to such activities or transactions. Business activities or transactions between one related, controlled or affiliated person and another will be subject to special scrutiny by the Director to ascertain whether common control is being used to reduce, avoid, or escape taxes. The authority of the Director to determine true taxable income extends to any case in which either by inadvertence, sham, or design the taxable income of a related, controlled or affiliated person is other than it would have been had the person, in the conduct of its affairs, been dealing at arm's length with an unrelated, uncontrolled or unaffiliated person. The Director will consider whether the persons are motivated by business purposes other than tax avoidance or are principally motivated by the desire to avoid taxes.

 B. The Director will consider the following to determine whether an arrangement between related, controlled, or affiliated persons results in an improper or inaccurate valuation of the activity:

 1. Whether the persons are motivated by business purposes other than tax avoidance or are principally motivated by tax avoidance. In no case shall the mere evasion or avoidance of taxation be regarded as a business purpose.

 2. Whether the separate businesses of the related, controlled or affiliated persons have economic substance because a reasonable possibility of obtaining a profit exists, apart from achieving tax benefits.

 3. Whether one person has a significant amount of capital gains, interest, dividend or similar income, but minimal capital, activity, or expenses, because essential business functions are performed for the person by another without arm's length consideration.

 4. In determining whether the related persons or entities are motivated by tax avoidance or whether they possess economic substance, the Director shall consider the following:

 a. The related person has an identifiable place of business with supporting business records.

 b. The related person maintains books and related accounting records.

 c. The related person has a staff of employees or has engaged independent contractors adequate in number and with sufficient expertise to conduct its business activities.

 d. The controlling person so controls and dominates the finances, policy and business activities of the related person that the related person has virtually no separate existence.

 e. The form employed for conducting business is a sham.

 C. The Director will use the following methods to assign a value to business activities or transactions between related, controlled, or affiliated persons when the Director determines that a true or market value has not been reported on a tax return:

 1. Fair market valuation. A value determined by comparing charges made for similar goods or services of like quality and character, in similar quantities, under comparable conditions of sale, to comparable unrelated party purchasers, including subsidies and bonuses.

 2. Cost basis. If no comparable goods or services can guide the Director in ascertaining the value, then such value may be determined upon a cost plus margin basis. All costs - including direct and indirect overhead costs -- attributable to the particular article, good or service shall be included. An appropriate profit margin shall also be added to the costs.

 3. Amount of dividends or loans received. If a parent corporation or controlling person provides services that are more than general oversight duties to a subsidiary or controlled person and receives no payments, or such payments are not at market value, but then receives dividends or loans from the subsidiary or controlled person for the services rendered, the Director shall deem the dividends or loans received to be compensation for the services rendered. If the total amount received from the subsidiary or controlled person, including such dividends or loans, is less than the market value of such service, the Director will tax the services rendered at the market value. If the amount of dividends or loans can be shown to be higher than the market value of the services then the market value will be used.

 General oversight duties of a parent corporation include high level management direction, strategic planning, stewardship duties or assisting in the financing of the controlled persons. These duties can be provided without taxation of the dividends, loans or compensation from subsidiaries or controlled persons. However, providing services for a subsidiary's or controlled person's customers, or providing accounting and administrative services, or providing marketing services, or providing other lower level management duties for a subsidiary or controlled person, or any similar activities will be subject to a market value determination and taxation.

 D. The following definitions apply within this section:

 1. "Market value" or "arms length consideration" is the amount that would be paid or received for similar activities or transactions of like quantity, quality, or character under similar circumstances and conditions by other persons where no common interest exists between the persons involved in the activities or transactions.

 2. "Related, controlled or affiliated person" means a person or entity that controls, or is controlled as the case may be, through common ownership. "Related," "controlled" and "affiliated" are used interchangeably when describing a subsidiary, however, related and affiliated can also mean the parent entity. The degree of ownership is unimportant, however the ability to control or influence the related, controlled or affiliated person is important in establishing whether relationships and transactions serve a business purpose, produce income, or merely avoid taxes.

 Section 10. Section 5.45.090 of the Seattle Municipal Code is hereby amended as follows:

 5.45.090 Exemptions.

 The provisions of this Chapter 5.45 and the licensing requirement in SMC 5.55.030 shall not apply to the following:

 A. ~~Nonprofit~~ Adult Family Homes. This chapter does not apply to ~~nonprofit~~ adult family homes which are licensed as such, or which are specifically exempt from licensing, under rules of the Washington State Department of Social and Health Services.

 ***

 I. Investments-Dividends From Subsidiary Corporations. This chapter shall not apply to amounts derived by persons, other than those engaging in banking, loan, security or other financial businesses, from investments or the use of money as such, and also amounts derived as dividends by a parent from its subsidiary corporations, provided that, dividends subject to tax pursuant to SMC 5.45.085 will not be exempt.

 Section 12. Section 5.46.030 of the Seattle Municipal Code is hereby amended as follows:

 5.46.030 Tax Imposed-Measure of the Tax.

 A. A square footage business tax for the act or privilege of engaging in business activities within the city is hereby levied upon and shall be collected from every person that leases, owns, occupies or otherwise maintains an office or place of business within the city.

 The tax shall be measured by the number of square feet of business floor space and other floor space for each office or place of business leased, owned, occupied or otherwise maintained within the city during the reporting period.

 B. The amount of the tax due shall be equal to the sum of the number of square feet of business floor space for each office or place of business leased, owned, occupied or otherwise maintained within the city multiplied by the rate of $0.39 quarterly ($1.56 annually), and the number of square feet of other floor space for each office or place of business leased, owned, occupied or otherwise maintained within the city multiplied by the rate of $0.13 quarterly ($0.52 annually). The Director will adjust the square footage business tax rate annually for inflation as follows: the tax rate for a year will be equal to the tax rate for the previous year increased (or decreased) by the percentage change in the annual Seattle-Tacoma-Bremerton, WA consumer price index for all urban consumers (CPI-U) for the previous year.

 C. Persons with more than one office or place of business must include all business floor space and other floor space for all locations. When a person rents space to another person, the person occupying the rental space is responsible for the square footage business tax on that rental space only if the renter has exclusive right of possession in the space as against the landlord. Space rented for the storage of goods in a warehouse where no walls separate the goods, and where the exclusive right of possession in the space is not held by the person to whom the space is rented, shall be included in the other floor space of the person that operates the warehouse business, and not by the business renting the warehouse space.

 D. Persons whose business floor space, other floor space, or period of occupancy changes during a reporting period shall prorate the business floor space or other floor space for the reporting period. A change in the period of occupancy during the reporting period shall be prorated using a ratio of the number of days of occupancy during the reporting period compared to the total number of days within the reporting period. If the amount of business floor space or other floor space changes during the reporting period, floor space for the period shall be computed as a weighted average of the rentable space occupied during different segments of the reporting period. Weighting will be based upon the percentage of the reporting period that a given amount of space was leased, owned, occupied, or otherwise maintained within the city.

 E. Any person required to pay the square footage business tax imposed in this chapter that also pays the business license tax as imposed in SMC 5.45.050 may take a credit against the square footage business  tax computed as follows:

 1. The credit is equal to the square footage business tax owed for the reporting period multiplied by the ratio of adjusted gross income derived from the Seattle business location(s) for the reporting period to the total gross income derived from the Seattle business location(s) for the reporting period.

 2. For the purpose of this section, "total gross income derived from the Seattle business location(s)" is equal to the total gross income derived from the business activities rendered by, generated from, or attributable to the place(s) of business located within the city.

 3. For the purpose of this section, "adjusted gross income derived from the Seattle business location(s)" shall include total gross income derived from the Seattle business location(s) less:

 (a) income derived from the sales of tangible personal property and retail services by the Seattle business location(s) delivered to a location within the State of Washington where no local jurisdiction imposes an eligible gross receipts tax; and

 (b) the gross income of the Seattle business location(s) subject to the business license tax under SMC 5.45.050G as determined by SMC 5.45.060 through SMC 5.45.080 less the gross income of the Seattle business location(s) subject to the business license tax under SMC 5.45.050G as determined by SMC 5.45.060 through SMC 5.45.076 and SMC 5.45.081.

 When the change in income calculated in subsection 3(b) is a negative number, the amount so calculated shall reduce the amount calculated in subsection 3(a); however, if the sum of the totals calculated under subsections 3(a) and 3(b) is a negative number, then the adjusted gross income derived from the Seattle business location(s) shall be equal to the total gross income derived from the Seattle business location(s).

 4. In computing the tax credit, any gross receipts from manufacturing, extracting, and printing, and also subject to a selling tax (such as retailing and wholesaling) according to the Multiple Activity Tax Credit (SMC 5.45.070), shall be included in the gross income and the adjusted gross income only once.

 Section 13. Section 5.46.040 of the Seattle Municipal Code is hereby amended as follows:

 5.46.040 Square footage business tax -When due.

 The tax imposed by this chapter shall be due and payable in accordance with SMC 5.55.040 in the same manner as the business license tax under SMC 5.45. Taxpayers filing their business license tax on a quarterly basis shall file the square footage business tax on a quarterly basis and taxpayers filing their business license tax on an annual basis shall file the square footage business tax on an annual basis on forms prescribed by the Director. Persons discontinuing their business activities in Seattle shall report and pay the square footage  business tax at the same time as they file their final business license tax return.

 Section 14. Section 5.46.050 of the Seattle Municipal Code is hereby amended as follows:
