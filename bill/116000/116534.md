 BE IT ORDAINED BY THE CITY OF SEATTLE AS FOLLOWS:

 Section Section 23.02.020 of the Seattle Municipal Code, which section was last amended by Ordinance 117570, is amended as follows:

 23.02.020 General purpose and general provisions.

A. The purpose of this Land Use Code is to protect and promote public health, safety and general welfare through a set of regulations and procedures for the use of land which are consistent with and implement the City's Comprehensive Plan. Procedures are established to increase citizen awareness of land use activities and their impacts and to coordinate necessary review processes. The Land Use Code classifies land within the City into various land use zones and overlay districts ~~which~~that regulate the use and bulk of buildings and structures. The provisions are designed to provide adequate light, air, access, and open space; conserve the natural environment and historic resources; maintain a compatible scale within an area; minimize traffic congestion and enhance the streetscape and pedestrian environment. They seek to achieve an efficient use of the land without major disruption of the natural environment and to direct development to sites with adequate services and amenities.

B. Other regulations apply, such as, but not limited to building and construction codes, (SMC Title 22) and provisions for environmental review, critical areas and historic preservation (SMC Title 25).

C. All structures or uses shall be built or established on a lot or lots.  D. A grant of a waiver, modification, departure, exception or variance from one specific development standard does not relieve the applicant from compliance with any other standard.

Section 2. Subsection B of Section 23.22.062 of the Seattle Municipal Code, which section was last amended by Ordinance 122190, is amended as follows:

 23.22.062 Unit lot subdivisions.

 * * *

 B. Except for any site for which a permit has been issued pursuant to Section 23.44.041 for a detached accessory dwelling unit, sites developed or proposed to be developed with dwelling units listed in subsection A above may be subdivided into individual unit lots. The development as a whole shall meet development standards applicable at the time the permit application is vested. As a result of the subdivision, development on individual unit lots may be nonconforming as to some or all of the development standards based on analysis of the individual unit lot.~~, except that any private, usable open space for each dwelling unit shall be provided on the same lot as the dwelling unit it serves.~~

 * * *

 Section 3. Subsection B of Section 23.24.045 of the Seattle Municipal Code, which section was last amended by Ordinance 122190, is amended as follows:

 23.24.045 Unit lot subdivisions.

 * * *

 B. Except for any site for which a permit has been issued pursuant to Section 23.44.041 for a detached accessory dwelling unit, sites developed or proposed to be developed with dwelling units listed in subsection A above may be subdivided into individual unit lots. The development as a whole shall meet development standards applicable at the time the permit application is vested. As a result of the subdivision, development on individual unit lots may be nonconforming as to some or all of the development standards based on analysis of the individual unit lot.~~, except that any private, usable open space for each dwelling unit shall be provided on the same lot as the dwelling unit it serves.~~

 * * *

 Section 4. Section 23.34.013 of the Seattle Municipal Code, which section was last amended by Ordinance 117430, is amended as follows:

 23.34.013 Designation of multifamily zones.

A. An area zoned single family that meets the criteria of Section 23.34.011 for single- family designation, may not be rezoned to a multifamily zone except as otherwise provided in Section 23.34.010 B.

B. Generally, reclassifications of areas to L3, MR and HR zones are appropriate in urban villages, urban centers or areas served by regional transit.  C. Multifamily zoning is appropriate for areas that are generally within 0.5 mile of existing or projected facilities and services used by residents, including retail sales and services, schools, parks and community centers.

 D. Land that is designated as an environmentally critical area or is a required buffer due to the presence of a wetland or wildlife habitat area or is within a shoreline environment is generally considered inappropriate for reclassification from a less intensive zone to a L3, MR or HR zone.

 E. The arrangement of multifamily zones in relation to other zones is generally intended to provide for a gradual transition in the scale and intensity of development.

 F. No land may be redesignated to Lowrise 4 (L4).

Section 5. Section 23.34.014 of the Seattle Municipal Code, which section was last amended by Ordinance 117430, is amended as follows:

 23.34.014 Lowrise Duplex/Triplex (LDT) zone, function and locational criteria.

~~A. Function. An area that provides opportunities for limited infill housing development, both through new construction and the conversion of existing single-family structures to duplexes and triplexes, where, in order to preserve the character of the neighborhood, the recycling of existing structures to a slightly higher density and small-scale infill development is preferable to single-family zoning or to the development of townhouses or higher density apartments.~~B. Locational Criteria. The Lowrise Duplex/Triplex zone designation is most appropriate in areas generally characterized by the following:

 1. Development Characteristics of the Area.

 a.Areas where structures areas of small bulk and low heights, generally less than thirty (30) feet, establish the pattern of development; and

 b. Areas with a mix of single-family structures, small multifamily structures, and single-family structures legally converted into multiple units where, because of the type and quality of the existing housing stock, it is desirable to limit new development opportunities to infill projects and conversions that preserve the existing character.

 2. Relationship to the Surrounding Area.

 a. Areas that do not meet single-family criteria, but are otherwise similar in character and adjoin areas zoned single- family or Lowrise 1 without necessarily the presence of a significant topographical break or open space to provide a transition to increased density;

 b. Areas where narrow streets, on-street parking congestion, local traffic congestion, lack of alleys, or irregular street patterns restrict local access and circulation;

 c. Areas close to existing or projected facilities and services used by households with children, including schools, parks and community centers.

 C. Areas zoned single family meeting the locational criteria for a single-family designation may be rezoned to LDT only when the provisions of Section 23.34.010 B are met.

A. Function. To provide opportunities for duplex and triplex multifamily housing, primarily through new infill development that is similar to the scale of single family structures permitted in single family zones, or through the conversion of existing single family structures to duplexes and triplexes.  B. Locational Criteria. The LDT zone is most appropriate on land that is generally characterized by the following conditions:

 1. A mix of single family structures, or similarly scaled multifamily structures 35 feet or less in height, and single family structures legally converted to multiple units or well-suited to conversion;

 2. Local access and circulation conditions that can accommodate this low density multifamily designation;

 3. Local access and circulation conditions that are conducive to multiple residential units, especially in structures oriented to the ground level and the street, preferably in locations separated from arterials;

 4. Areas where a gradual transition is appropriate between single family zoned areas and multifamily or neighborhood commercial zoned areas;

 5. Areas that are zoned single family may be rezoned to LDT only when the provisions of 23.34.010 are met.

Section 6. Section 23.34.016 of the Seattle Municipal Code, which section was last amended by Ordinance 119242, is amended as follows:

 23.34.016 Lowrise 1 (L1) zone, function and locational criteria.

~~A. Function. An area that provides low density, primarily ground-related multifamily housing opportunities.~~B. Locational Criteria. The Lowrise 1 zone designation is most appropriate in areas generally characterized by the following:

 1. Development Characteristics of the Area.

 a. Areas where scale structures of low heights, generally less than thirty (30) feet, and small bulk establish the pattern of development;

 b. Areas with:

 (1) A mix of single-family structures, small multifamily structures and single-family structures legally converted into multiple units where, because of the type and quality of the existing housing stock, it is desirable to encourage new development opportunities, or

 (2) Numerous or large vacant parcels suitable for family housing where densities greater than single-family are desired; and

 c. Areas where internal vehicular circulation is conducive to residential units that are oriented to the ground level and the street. Preferred locations are generally separated from principal arterials, as defined by the Seattle Comprehensive Transportation Program, which conflict with the desired character of L1 areas.

 2. Relationship to the Surrounding Areas.

 a. Properties that are definable pockets within a larger, higher density multifamily area, where it is desirable to preserve a small-scale character;

 b. Properties generally surrounded by a larger single-family area where variation and replacement in housing type could be accommodated without significant disruption of the pattern, character or livability of the surrounding development;

 c. Properties where a gradual transition is appropriate between single-family areas and more intensive multifamily or neighborhood commercial zones;

 d. Properties in areas where narrow streets, on- street parking congestion, local traffic congestion, or irregular street patterns restrict local access and circulation;

 e. Properties in areas close to facilities and services used by households with children, including schools, parks and community centers.

 C. Areas zoned single family meeting the locational criteria for single-family designation may be rezoned to L1 only when the provisions of Section 23.34.010 B are met.

A. Function. To provide opportunities for low density multifamily housing, such as townhouses, or to provide a transition from SF or LDT zoned areas to other higher density multifamily or neighborhood commercial zones.  B. Locational Criteria. The L1 zone is most appropriate on land that is generally characterized by the following conditions:

 1. Low-scale structures with structure heights of thirty-five feet or less, compatible with SF and LDT zones;

 2. Local access and circulation conditions that are conducive to multiple residential units, especially in structures oriented to the ground level and the street, preferably in locations that do not abut arterials;

 3. Areas where a gradual transition is appropriate between SF or LDT zones and higher density multifamily or neighborhood commercial zones;

 4. Areas that are zoned single family may be rezoned to L1 only when the provisions of 23.34.010 are met.

Section 7. Section 23.34.018 of the Seattle Municipal Code, which section was last amended by Ordinance 118794, is amended as follows:

 23.34.018 Lowrise 2 (L2) zone, function and locational criteria.

~~A. Function. The intent of the Lowrise 2 zone is to encourage a variety of multifamily housing types with less emphasis than the Lowrise 1 zone on ground-related units, while remaining at a scale compatible with single-family structures.~~B. Locational Criteria. Lowrise 2 zone designation is most appropriate in areas generally characterized by the following:

 1. Development Characteristics of the Areas.

 a. Areas that feature a mix of single-family structures and small to medium multifamily structures generally occupying one (1) or two (2) lots, with heights generally less than thirty (30) feet;

 b. Areas suitable for multifamily development where topographic conditions and the presence of views make it desirable to limit height and building bulk to retain views from within the zone;

 c. Areas occupied by a substantial amount of multifamily development where factors such as narrow streets, on-street parking congestion, local traffic congestion, lack of alleys and irregular street patterns restrict local access and circulation and make an intermediate intensity of development desirable.

 2. Relationship to the Surrounding Areas.

 a. Properties that are well-suited to multifamily development, but where adjacent single-family areas make a transitional scale of development desirable. It is desirable that there be a well-defined edge such as an arterial, open space, change in block pattern, topographic change or other significant feature providing physical separation from the single-family area. However, this is not a necessary condition where existing moderate scale multifamily structures have already established the scale relationship with abutting single-family areas;

 b. Properties that are definable pockets within a more intensive area, where it is desirable to preserve a smaller scale character and mix of densities;

 c. Properties in areas otherwise suitable for higher density multifamily development but where it is desirable to limit building height and bulk to protect views from uphill areas or from public open spaces and scenic routes;

 d. Properties where vehicular access to the area does not require travel on "residential access streets" in less intensive residential zones.

A. Function. To provide opportunities for moderate density multifamily housing, such as townhouse and stacked flat developments, at a scale and character compatible with other lower density single family and multifamily zones, that may serve to provide a transition between zones of different scales and intensities.  B. Locational Criteria. The L2 zone is most appropriate on land that is generally characterized by the following conditions:

 1. A mix of small to medium scale multifamily structures generally occupying not more than one or two lots;

 2. Local access and circulation conditions that can accommodate a modest increase in density to that permitted in L2;

 3. Areas where a transition is appropriate between lower density multifamily zones and higher density multifamily or neighborhood commercial zones;

 4. Areas with a well-defined edge such as an arterial, open space, change in block pattern, topographic change or other significant feature that provides separation from abutting single family zoned areas;

 5. Areas where narrow streets, on-street parking congestion, local traffic congestion, lack of alleys and irregular street patterns restrict local access and circulation and make designations more intensive than L2 less desirable.

 Section 8. Section 23.34.020 of the Seattle Municipal Code, which section was last amended by Ordinance 121700, is amended as follows:

 23.34.020 Lowrise 3 (L3) zone, function and locational criteria.

~~A. Function. An area that provides moderate scale multifamily housing opportunities in multifamily neighborhoods where it is desirable to limit development to infill projects and conversions compatible with the existing mix of houses and small to moderate scale apartment structures.~~B. Locational Criteria.

 1. Threshold Conditions. Subject to subsection B2 of this section, properties that may be considered for an L3 designation are limited to the following:

 a. Properties already zoned L3;

 b. Properties in areas already developed predominantly to the permitted L3 density and where L3 scale is well established;

 c. Properties within an urban center or village, except in the Wallingford Residential Urban Village, in the Eastlake Residential Urban Village, in the Upper Queen Anne Residential Urban Village, in the Morgan Junction Residential Urban Village, in the Lake City Hub Urban Village, in the Bitter Lake Village Hub Urban Village, or in the Admiral Residential Urban Village; or

 d. Properties located in the Delridge Neighborhood Revitalization Area, as shown in Exhibit 23.34.020 A, provided that the L3 zone designation would facilitate a mixed-income housing development initiated by a public agency or the Seattle Housing Authority; a property use and development agreement is executed subject to the provisions of SMC Chapter 23.76 as a condition to any rezone; and the development would serve a broad public purpose.

 2. Properties designated as environmentally critical may not be rezoned to an L3 designation, and may remain L3 only in areas predominantly developed to the intensity of the L3 zone.

 3. Other Criteria. The Lowrise 3 zone designation is most appropriate in areas generally characterized by the following:

 a. Development Characteristics of the Area.

 (1) Either:

 (a) Areas that are already developed predominantly to the permitted L3 density and where L3 scale is well established,

 (b) Areas that are within an urban center or urban village, except in the Wallingford Residential Urban Village, in the Eastlake Residential Urban Village, in the Upper Queen Anne Residential Urban Village, in the Morgan Junction Residential Urban Village, in the Lake City Hub Urban Village, in the Bitter Lake Village Hub Urban Village, or in the Admiral Residential Urban Village; or

 (c) Areas that are located within the Delridge Neighborhood Revitalization Area, as shown in Exhibit 23.34.020 A, provided that the L3 zone designation would facilitate a mixed-income housing development initiated by a public agency or the Seattle Housing Authority; a property use and development agreement is executed subject to the provisions of SMC Chapter 23.76 as a condition to any rezone; and the development would serve a broad public purpose.

 (2) Areas where the street pattern provides for adequate vehicular circulation and access to sites. Locations with alleys are preferred. Street widths should be sufficient for two (2) way traffic and parking along at least one (1) curbside.

 b. Relationship to the Surrounding Areas.

 (1) Properties in areas that are well served by public transit and have direct access to arterials, so that vehicular traffic is not required to use streets that pass through less intensive residential zones;

 (2) Properties in areas with significant topographic breaks, major arterials or open space that provide sufficient transition to LDT or L1 multifamily development;

 (3) Properties in areas with existing multifamily zoning with close proximity and pedestrian connections to neighborhood services, public open spaces, schools and other residential amenities;

 (4) Properties that are adjacent to business and commercial areas with comparable height and bulk, or where a transition in scale between areas of larger multifamily and/or commercial structures and smaller multifamily development is desirable.

A. Function. To provide opportunities for a range of multifamily housing types in existing multifamily neighborhoods with a mix of small to moderate scale residential structures or to accommodate redevelopment in areas within urban centers and urban villages where it is desirable to establish multifamily neighborhoods of moderate scale and density.  B. Locational Criteria. The L3 zone is most appropriate on land not subject to subsection C, and that is generally characterized by the following conditions:

 1. Adjacency to neighborhood commercial areas with comparable height and scale, or where a transition in scale between areas of larger multifamily and/or commercial structures and smaller multifamily structures is desirable;

 2. Alley access to sites is preferred, and street widths should be sufficient for two way traffic and parking along at least one curb;

 3. Well served by public transit with direct access to arterial streets that can accommodate anticipated vehicular circulation so that traffic is not required to use streets that pass through lower density residential zones;

 4. In close proximity, generally 0.5 mile, and with pedestrian connections to neighborhood services.

 C. Land zoned a less intensive designation within the following areas may not be rezoned to L3:

 1. The following urban villages: Admiral, Eastlake, Lake City, Morgan Junction, Upper Queen Anne, or Wallingford;

In the case of a through lot, parking may also be located in one ~~(1)~~ front setback when landscaped as described in this subsection;

 3. Development standard departure may be granted or required pursuant to the procedures set forth in Chapter 23.79 to permit parking location anywhere on the lot and to reduce required landscaping. Landscaping may be waived in whole or in part if the topography of the site or other circumstances result in the purposes of landscaping being served, as, for example, when a steep slope shields parking from the view of abutting properties. This test may be waived by the Director when waiver would contribute to reduced demolition of residential structures.

~~G.~~J. Bus and Truck Loading and Unloading.

 1. Unless subsection ~~G 4~~J4 of this section applies, an off-street bus loading and unloading area of a size reasonable to meet the needs of the school shall be provided and may be located in any required yard.

 3. Development standard departure from the requirements and standards for bus and truck loading and unloading areas and berths may be granted or required pursuant to the procedures and criteria set forth in Chapter 23.79 only when departure would contribute to reduced demolition of residential structures.

 4. When a public school is remodeled or rebuilt at the same site, an existing on-street bus loading area is allowed if the following conditions are met:

 a. The school site is not proposed to be expanded;

 b. The student capacity of the school is not being expanded by more than ~~twenty-five (25)~~25 percent; and

 c. The location of the current on-street bus loading remains the same.

~~H.~~K. Noise, Odor, Light and Glare. The development standards for small institutions set forth in ~~subsections A1, B and C of Section 23.45.100 shall~~Section 23.45.554 apply. Development standard departure from these standards may be granted or required pursuant to the procedures and criteria set forth in Chapter 23.79 only when departure would contribute to reduced demolition of residential structures.

 Section 27. Section 23.45.112 of the Seattle Municipal Code, relating to public schools in multifamily zones, which section was last amended by Ordinance 121477, is repealed.

 Section 28. Section 23.44.036 of the Seattle Municipal Code, which section was last amended by Ordinance 121477, is amended and recodified as a new Chapter 23.51A as follows:

~~23.44.036 Public facilities.~~Chapter 23.51A Public facilities in residential zones  23.51A.002 Public facilities in single family zones

A. Except as provided in subsections B, D and E below, uses in public facilities that are most similar to uses permitted outright or permitted as an administrative conditional use under this chapter ~~shall also be~~are also permitted outright or as an administrative conditional use, subject to the same use regulations, development standards and administrative conditional use criteria that govern the similar use. The City Council may waive or modify applicable development standards or administrative conditional use criteria according to the provisions of Chapter 23.76, Subchapter III, Council Land Use Decisions, with public projects considered as Type IV quasi-judicial decisions and City facilities considered as Type V legislative decisions.

 B. Permitted Uses in Public Facilities Requiring City Council Approval. The following uses in public facilities in single-family zones may be permitted by the City Council, according to the provisions of Chapter 23.76, Procedures for Master Use Permits and Council Land Use Decisions:

 1. Police precinct station;

 2. Fire station;

 3. Public boat moorage;

 4. Utility services use; and

 5. Other similar use.

 The proponent of any such use shall demonstrate the existence of a public necessity for the public facility use in a single-family zone. The public facility use shall be developed according to the development standards for institutions (Section 23.44.022), unless the City Council makes a determination to waive or modify applicable development standards according to the provisions of Chapter 23.76, Subchapter III, Council Land Use Decisions, with public projects considered as Type IV quasi-judicial decisions and City facilities considered as ~~type~~Type V legislative decisions.

 C. Expansion of Uses in Public Facilities.

 1. Major Expansion. Major expansions may be permitted to uses in public facilities allowed in subsections A and B above according to the same provisions and procedural requirements as described in these subsections. A major expansion of a public facility use occurs when the expansion that is proposed would not meet development standards or exceed either ~~seven hundred fifty (750)~~750 square feet or ~~ten (10)~~10 percent of its existing area, whichever is greater, including gross floor area and areas devoted to active outdoor uses other than parking.

 2. Minor Expansion. When an expansion falls below the major expansion threshold level, it is a minor expansion. Minor expansions may be permitted to uses in public facilities allowed in subsections A and B above according to the provisions of Chapter 23.76, Procedures for Master Use Permits and Council Land Use Decisions, for a Type I Master Use Permit when the development standards of the zone in which the public facility is located are met.

 D. Sewage Treatment Plants. The expansion or reconfiguration (which term shall include reconstruction, redevelopment, relocation on the site, or intensification of treatment capacity) of existing sewage treatment plants in single-family zones may be permitted if there is no feasible alternative location in a zone where the use is permitted and the conditions imposed under subsections D3 and D4 are met.

 1. Applicable Procedures. The decision on an application for the expansion or reconfiguration of a sewage treatment plant ~~shall be~~is a Type IV Council land use decision. If an application for an early determination of feasibility is required to be filed pursuant to subsection D2 of this section, the early determination of feasibility will also be a Council land use decision subject to Sections 23.76.038 through 23.76.056.

 2. Need for Feasible Alternative Determination. The proponent shall demonstrate that there is no feasible alternative location in a zone where establishment of the use is permitted.

 a. The Council's decision as to the feasibility of alternative location(s) shall be based upon a full consideration of the environmental, social and economic impacts on the community, and the intent to preserve and to protect the physical character of single-family areas, and to protect single-family areas from intrusions of non-single-family uses.

 b. The determination of feasibility may be the subject of a separate application for a Council land use decision prior to submission of an application for a project-specific approval if the Director determines that the expansion or reconfiguration proposal is complex, involves the phasing of programmatic and project-specific decisions or affects more than one site in a single-family zone.

 c. Application for an early determination of feasibility shall include:

 (1) The scope and intent of the proposed project in the single-family zone and appropriate alternative(s) in zones where establishment of the use is permitted, identified by the applicant or the Director;

 (2) The necessary environmental documentation as determined by the Director, including an assessment of the impacts of the proposed project and of the permitted-zone alternative(s), according to the state and local SEPA guidelines;

 (3) Information on the overall sewage treatment system ~~which~~that outlines the interrelationship of facilities in single-family zones and in zones where establishment of the use is permitted;

 (4) Schematic plans outlining dimensions, elevations, locations on site and similar specifications for the proposed project and for the alternative(s).

 d. If a proposal or any portion of a proposal is also subject to a feasible or reasonable alternative location determination under Section 23.60.066 ~~of Title 23~~, the Plan Shoreline Permit application and the early determination application will be considered in one determination process.

 3. Conditions for Approval of Proposal.

 a. The project shall be located so that adverse impacts on residential areas shall be minimized;

 b. The expansion of a facility shall not result in a concentration of institutions or facilities that would create or appreciably aggravate impacts that are incompatible with single-family residences.

 c. A facility management and transportation plan shall be required. The level and kind of detail to be disclosed in the plan shall be based on the probable impacts and/or scale of the proposed facility, and shall at a minimum include discussion of sludge transportation, noise control, and hours of operation. Increased traffic and parking expected to occur with use of the facility shall not create a serious safety problem or a blighting influence on the neighborhood;

 d. Measures to minimize potential odor emission and airborne pollutants including methane shall meet standards of and be consistent with best available technology as determined in consultation with the Puget Sound Clean Air Agency (PSCAA), and shall be incorporated into the design and operation of the facility;

 e. Methods of storing and transporting chlorine and other hazardous and potentially hazardous chemicals shall be determined in consultation with the Seattle Fire Department and incorporated into the design and operation of the facility;

 23.45.516 Additional height and extra floor area

 A. General. Additional height, above the base height limit, or extra floor area, or both, may be permitted up to the maximum limits allowed by Sections 23.45.510 and 23.45.514, according to the provisions of this section, Section 23.45.526 and Chapter 23.58A. "Extra floor area" is the amount of chargeable floor area in excess of the lesser of (a) the base FAR, or (b) the total chargeable floor area of stories located entirely below the maximum height that would be allowed if the structure did not qualify for additional height under this section.

 B. Eligible lots. The following lots are eligible for additional height and extra floor area:

 1. Lots in L3 zones in urban villages, urban centers or within the Station Area Overlay District, except: (a) lots that are located in the Admiral, Eastlake, Lake City, Morgan Junction, Upper Queen Anne, or Wallingford Urban Villages; or (b) portions of lots that are within 50 feet of a lot line of an abutting single family zoned lot are eligible for extra floor area but are not eligible for additional height;

 2. Lots in MR zones in urban villages, urban centers and the Station Area Overlay District; and

 3. Lots in HR zones.

 C. Highrise Zones.

 1. Extra Floor Area. In HR zones extra floor area may be gained in accordance with Chapter 23.58A. Up to 40 percent of extra floor area may be gained by one or any combination of: (a) transfer of development potential; (b) providing neighborhood open space or a payment in lieu thereof; (c) providing a green street setback where those options are available pursuant to subsection F, all in accordance with this section and Chapter 23.58A.

 2. Structure Height.

 a. Structures up to 240 feet. The applicable height limit in an HR zone under subsection 23.45.514A is 240 feet if the applicant satisfies the conditions for extra floor area but not all of the conditions in subsection C2b of this section are met.

 b. Structures over 240 feet. The applicable height limit in an HR zone under subsection 23.45.514A is 300 feet if the applicant satisfies the conditions for extra floor area and the following additional conditions are met:

 (1) For any structure above a height of 85 feet, the average residential gross floor area per story above a height of 45 feet does not exceed 9,500 square feet; and

 (2) No parking is located at or above grade, unless it is separated from all street lot lines by another use; and

 (3) At least 25 percent of the lot area at grade is one or more landscaped areas, each with a minimum horizontal dimension of 10 feet, or at least 20 percent of the lot area at grade is landscaped, common residential amenity area meeting the standards of 23.45.524.

 c. Additional height above the applicable height limit of 300 feet. A structure may exceed the applicable height limit of 300 feet either (1) by 30 feet if the area bounded by the facades of the portion of the structure above 300 feet is no greater than 6,500 square feet, or (2) by 45 feet if the area bounded by the facades at an elevation that is halfway between 300 feet and the height of the structure is no greater than 50 percent of the area bounded by the facades at a height of 300 feet. In either case the area bounded by the facades may be occupied only by those uses or features otherwise permitted in Section 23.45.514 as an exception above the height limit, although any limits on the height or coverage of those uses or features totally screened by the facades extending above a height of 300 feet shall not apply. Height exceptions permitted for screening and rooftop features under 23.45.514F shall not be permitted above the height gained by a structure under this provision.

 D. Transfer of development potential (TDP) from Landmark Structures and Open Space.

 1. Sending lots. Lots eligible as Landmark TDP sending sites and Open space TDP sending sites must be located in a MR or HR zone located in the First Hill Urban Center Village, and are subject to the limits and conditions in this chapter and Chapter 23.58A.

 2. Receiving lots. Any lot located in a HR zone within the First Hill Urban Center Village which allows additional FAR according to the provisions of this section is eligible to receive TDP from an eligible sending lot, and subject to the limits and conditions in this Chapter and Chapter 23.58A.

 E. Combined lot development. When authorized by the Director pursuant to this section, lots located on the same block in an HR zone may be combined, whether contiguous or not, solely for the purpose of allowing some or all of the capacity for chargeable floor area on one or more such lots under this chapter to be used on one or more other lots, according to the provisions of this subsection E.

 1. Up to all of the capacity on one lot, referred to in this subsection E as the "base lot," for chargeable floor area in addition to the base FAR, pursuant to Section 23.45.510 (referred to in this subsection E as "bonus capacity"), may be used on one or more other lots, subject to compliance with all conditions to obtaining extra floor area, pursuant to Chapter 23.58A, as modified in this section. For purposes of applying any conditions related to amenities or features provided on site under Section 23.45.516 only the lot or lots on which such bonus capacity is used are considered to be the lot or site using a bonus. Criteria for use of extra floor area that apply to the structure or structures shall be applied only to the structure(s) on the lots using the transferred bonus capacity. For purposes of the condition to height above 240 feet in subsection C2b3 of this section, all lots in a combined lot development are considered as one lot.

 2. Only if all of the bonus capacity on all lots in a combined lot development is used on fewer than all of those lots, there may be transferred from a base lot where no bonus capacity is used, to one or more other lots in the combined lot development, up to all of the unused base FAR on the base lot, without regard to limits on the transfer or on use of TDP in Chapter 23.58A. Such transfer shall be treated as a transfer of TDP for purposes of determining remaining development capacity on the base lot and TDP available to transfer under Chapter 23.58A, but shall be treated as additional base FAR on the other lots, and, to the extent that, together with other base floor area, it does not exceed the amount of chargeable floor area below the base height limit on the lot where it is used, it shall not be treated as extra floor area. If less than all of the bonus capacity of the base lot is used on such other lots, and if the base lot qualifies as a sending lot for TDP, the unused base FAR may be transferred as TDP to the extent permitted by Chapter 23.58A and this section, but in each case only to satisfy in part the conditions to extra floor area, not as additional base FAR.

 3. To the extent permitted by the Director, the maximum chargeable floor area for any one or more lots in the combined lot development may be increased up to the combined maximum chargeable floor area under Section 23.45.510 computed for all lots participating in the combined lot development, provided that the maximum chargeable floor area on one or more other lots in the combined lot development is correspondingly reduced. To the extent permitted by the Director, and subject to subsection E2 of this section, the base floor area for any one or more lots in the combined lot development may be increased up to the combined base chargeable floor area under Section 23.45.510 computed for all lots participating in the combined lot development, provided that the base floor area on one or more other lots in the combined lot development is correspondingly reduced.

 4. The Director shall allow a combined lot development only to the extent that the Director determines, in a Type I land use decision, that permitting more chargeable floor area than would otherwise be allowed on a lot or lots and the corresponding reduction on another lot or lots will result in a significant public benefit through one of more of the following:

 a. preservation of a landmark structure located on the block or on an adjacent block either through the inclusion of the lot with the landmark structure as a base lot in the combined lot development or through the transfer of TDP from the lot with the landmark structure to a lot in the combined lot development;

 b. inclusion on the same block of a structure in which low-income housing is provided to satisfy all or part of the conditions to extra residential floor area; and/or

 c. provision of open space on the same block to satisfy in part the conditions to extra residential floor area.

 5. The fee owners of each of the combined lots shall execute an appropriate agreement or instrument, which shall include the legal descriptions of each lot and shall be recorded in the King County real property records. In the agreement or instrument, the owners shall acknowledge the extent to which development capacity on each base lot is reduced by the use of such capacity on another lot or lots, at least for so long as the chargeable floor area for which such capacity is used remains on such other lot or lots. The agreement or instrument shall also provide that its covenants and conditions shall run with the land and shall be specifically enforceable by the parties and by the City of Seattle.

 6. Nothing in this subsection E shall allow the development on any lot in a combined lot development to exceed or deviate from height limits or other development standards.

 F. Green Street Setback. Floor area may be gained for a green street setback according to the provisions of 23.58A by development on lots abutting one of the following streets or street segments within the First Hill Urban Village, as shown on Map A for 23.45.516, if the Director has approved a green street plan for that street or segment and determines that the improvements proposed by the applicant will substantially contribute to the implementation of such plan:

 1. 8th Avenue, between Madison Street and James Street;

 2. Terry Avenue, between Pike Street and James Street;

 3. University Street from 9th Avenue to Boylston Avenue; or

 4. Spring Street from Boren Avenue to Harvard Avenue.

 G. Neighborhood open space. Floor area may be gained by development that provides for neighborhood open space according to the provisions of 23.58A.

~~A. Quantity.~~1. A minimum landscaped area that is equivalent in square footage to three (3) feet times the total length of all property lines shall be provided, except as specified in subsection A5 of this section.

 2. If screening and landscaping of parking from direct street view is provided according to subsection D of Section 23.45.018, that amount of landscaped area may be counted toward fulfilling the total amount of landscaped area required by this section.

 3. Landscaped usable open space that is provided for apartments or terraced housing and located at ground level, may be counted toward fulfilling the total amount of landscaped area required by this section.

 4. Street trees shall be provided in the planting strip according to Seattle Department of Transportation Tree Planting Standards, unless it is not possible to meet the standards. Existing street trees may count toward meeting the street tree requirement.

 5. Exceptions.

 a. If full landscaping is not possible because of the location of existing structures and/or existing parking, the amount of required landscaped area may be reduced by up to fifty (50) percent. The Director may require that landscaping which cannot be provided on the lot be provided in the planting strip.

 b. If landscaping would obscure the visibility of retail uses or obstruct pedestrian access to retail uses, and there is no other location on the lot for the landscaping, the Director may reduce or waive the amount of landscaping required in those locations. No reduction or waiver shall apply to screening and landscaping of parking required by subsection D of Section 23.45.018 or open space required by Section 23.45.016.

 B. Development Standards.

 1. Except for the screening and landscaping of parking, which shall be provided according to subsection D of Section 23.45.018, landscaping may be provided on all sides of the lot, or may be concentrated in one (1) or more areas. However, a landscaped area at least three (3) feet deep shall be provided at the following locations, except as provided in subsection B2:

 a. Along street property lines;

 b. Along property lines which abut single-family zoned lots;

 c. Along alleys across from single-family zoned lots.

 2. Breaks in required screening and landscaping shall be permitted to provide pedestrian and vehicular access.

When an alley is used as an aisle, the Director may reduce or waive the required screening or landscaping along the alley.

 3. Required landscaping shall meet standards promulgated by the Director.

 C. Tree Requirements in Landscaped Areas in Lowrise Duplex/Triplex, Lowrise 1, and Lowrise 2 Zones.

 1. Trees shall be required when new lowrise multifamily dwelling units are constructed. This requirement may be met using options in subsection C1a or C1b below. The minimum number of caliper inches of tree required per lot may be met through using either the tree preservation option or tree planting option set forth below, or through a combination of preservation and planting. Trees within public and private rights-of-way may not be used to meet this standard.

 a. Tree Preservation Option. For lots over three thousand (3,000) square feet, at least two (2) caliper inches of existing tree per one thousand (1,000) square feet of lot area must be preserved. On lots that are three thousand (3,000) square feet or smaller, at least three (3) caliper inches of existing tree must be preserved per lot. When this option is used, a tree preservation plan is required.

 b. Tree Planting Option. For lots over three thousand (3,000) square feet, at least two (2) caliper inches of tree per one thousand (1,000) square feet of lot area must be planted. On lots that are three thousand (3,000) square feet or smaller, at least three (3) caliper inches of tree must be planted per lot.

 2. Tree Measurements. Trees planted to meet the requirements in subsection C1 above shall be at least one and one-half (1.5) inches in diameter. The diameter of new trees shall be measured (in caliper inches) six (6) inches above the ground. Existing trees shall be measured four and one-half (4.5) feet above the ground. When an existing tree is three (3) to ten (10) inches in diameter, each one (1) inch counts as one (1) inch toward meeting the tree requirements in subsection C1 above. When an existing tree is more than ten (10) inches in diameter, each one (1) inch of the tree that is over ten (10) inches shall count as three (3) inches toward meeting the tree requirement.

 3. Tree Preservation Plans. If the tree preservation option is chosen, a tree preservation plan must be submitted and approved. The plan may be submitted as part of the overall landscaping plan for the project. Tree preservation plans shall provide for protection of trees during construction according to standards promulgated by the Department of Planning and Development.

A. Landscaping requirements.  1. Standards. All landscaping provided to meet requirements under this section must meet standards promulgated by the Director to provide for the long-term health, viability, and coverage of plantings. The Director may promulgate standards relating, but not limited to, the type and size of plants, number of plants, concentration of plants, depths of soil, use of drought-tolerant plants, and access to light and air for plants.

 2. Green Factor Requirement. Landscaping that achieves a Green Factor score of 0.6 or greater is required for any new development in multifamily residential zones.

 3. Green Factor Calculation. The Green Factor score for a lot is determined as follows:

 a. Multiply the square feet, or equivalent square footage where applicable, of each of the existing and proposed elements listed in Table A for 23.45.524 by the green area multiplier shown for that element, according to the following provisions:

 (1) If multiple elements listed on Table A for 23.45.524 occupy an area (for example, groundcover under a tree), the full square footage or equivalent square footage of each element is used to calculate the product for that element.

 (2) In rights-of-way adjacent to the lot, landscaping that is provided between the lot line and the roadway may be included, provided that it is approved by the Director of the Department of Transportation.

 (3) Elements listed on Table A for 23.45.524 that are provided to satisfy any requirements of this chapter may be included.

 (4) For trees, large shrubs, and large perennials, use the equivalent square footage according to Table B for 23.45.524.

 (5) For vegetated walls, use the square footage of the portion of the wall covered by vegetation.

 (6) For all elements other than trees, large shrubs, and vegetated walls, square footage is determined by the area of the portion of a horizontal plane that lies over or under the element.

 (7) The score for all pervious paving areas together may not exceed 1/3 of the total Green Factor score for a site.

 b. Add together all the products computed under subsection A3a to determine the Green Factor numerator.

 c. Divide the Green Factor numerator by the lot area to determine the Green Factor score.

 23.47A.006 Conditional uses.

~~A. All conditional uses are subject to the procedures described in Chapter 23.76, Master Use Permits and Council Land Use Decisions, and must not be materially detrimental to the public welfare or injurious to property in the zone or vicinity in which the property is located. In authorizing a conditional use, the Director or City Council may require that adverse impacts be mitigated by imposing any conditions to protect other properties in the zone or vicinity, to compensate for impacts, and to protect the public interest. The Director shall deny or recommend denial of a conditional use if the Director determines that adverse impacts cannot be mitigated satisfactorily.~~B

A. The following uses, where identified as administrative conditional uses on Chart A of Section 23.47A.004, or other ~~features of development~~uses identified in this ~~S~~section, may be permitted by the Director when the provisions of both ~~subsection A~~Section 23.42.042 and this subsection are met:

 1. Drinking establishments. Drinking establishments in NC1 and NC2 zones may be permitted as a conditional use subject to the following ~~conditions or criteria~~:

 a. The size of the drinking establishment, design of the structure, signing and illumination must be compatible with the character of the commercial area and other structures in the vicinity, particularly in areas where a distinct and definite pattern or style has been established.

 b. The location, access and design of parking must be compatible with adjacent residential zones.

 c. Special consideration will be given to the location and design of the doors and windows of drinking establishments to help ensure that noise standards will not be exceeded. The Director may require additional setbacks and/or restrict openings where the drinking establishment is located on a lot that abuts or is across from a residential zone.

 d. Drinking establishments must not generate traffic that creates traffic congestion or further worsens spillover parking on residential streets.

 2. Park-and-ride lots. Park-and-ride lots in NC3, C1 and C2 zones may be permitted as conditional uses subject to the following ~~conditions or criteria~~:

 a. The park-and-ride lot shall have direct vehicular access to a designated arterial improved to City standards.

 b. If the proposed park-and-ride lot is located on a lot containing accessory parking for other uses, there must be no substantial conflict in the principal operating hours of the park-and-ride lot and other uses on the lot.

 c. The Director may require landscaping and screening in addition to that required for surface parking areas, noise mitigation, vehicular access control, signage restrictions, and other measures to provide comfort and safety for pedestrians and bicyclists and to ensure the compatibility of the park-and-ride lot with the surrounding area.

 3. Residential Uses in C2 zones.

 a. Residential uses may be permitted in C2 zones as a conditional use subject to the following criteria:

 (1) The residential use generally should not be located in an area with direct access to major transportation systems such as freeways, state routes and freight rail lines.

 (2) The residential use generally should not be located in close proximity to industrial areas and/or nonresidential uses or devices that have the potential to create a nuisance or adversely affect the desirability of the area for living purposes as indicated by one of the following:

 (a) The nonresidential use is prohibited in the NC3 zone;

 (b) The nonresidential use or device is classified as a major noise generator; or

 (c) The nonresidential use is classified as a major odor source.

 (3) In making a determination to permit or prohibit residential uses in C2 zones, the Director shall take the following factors into account:

 (a) The distance between the lot in question and major transportation systems and potential nuisances;

 (b) The presence of physical buffers between the lot in question and major transportation systems and potential nuisance uses;

 (c) The potential cumulative impacts of residential uses on the availability for nonresidential uses of land near major transportation systems; and

 (d) The number, size and cumulative impacts of potential nuisances on the proposed residential uses.

 b. Residential uses required to obtain a shoreline conditional use permit are not required to obtain an administrative conditional use permit.

 c. Additions to, or on-site accessory structures for, existing residential structures are permitted outright.

 4. Medical service uses. Medical service uses over ~~ten thousand (~~10,000~~)~~ square feet, outside but within ~~two thousand five hundred (~~2,500~~)~~ feet of a medical Major Institution overlay district boundary, may be approved as administrative conditional uses, except that they are permitted outright if included in an adopted master plan or dedicated to veterinary services. In order to approve a medical service use under this subsection, the Director must determine that an adequate supply of commercially zoned land for businesses serving neighborhood residents will continue to exist. The following factors will be used in making this determination:

 a. Whether the amount of medical service uses existing and proposed in the vicinity would result in an area containing a concentration of medical services with few other uses; and

 b. Whether medical service uses would displace existing neighborhood-serving commercial uses at street level or disrupt a continuous commercial street front, particularly of general sales and services uses, or significantly detract from an area's overall neighborhood-serving commercial character.

 5. Change of One Nonconforming Use to Another. A nonconforming use may be converted by an administrative conditional use authorization to a use not otherwise permitted in the zone based on the following factors:

 a. New uses are limited to those permitted in the next more intensive zone;

 b. The relative impacts of size, parking, traffic, light, glare, noise, odor and similar impacts of the two ~~(2)~~ uses, and how these impacts could be mitigated~~.~~;

c. The Director must find that the new nonconforming use is no more detrimental to property in the zone and vicinity than the existing nonconforming use.

 6. Lodging uses in NC2 zones. Lodging uses in NC2 zones are permitted up to 25,000 ~~sq. ft.~~square feet, when all of the following conditions are met, except that bed and breakfasts in existing structures are permitted outright with no maximum size limit:

 The parking quantity exceptions set forth in this section apply in all zones except downtown zones, ~~which are~~ regulated by Section 23.49.019, and Major Institution zones, ~~which are~~ regulated by Section 23.54.016.

 A. Adding Units to Existing Structures in Multifamily and Commercial Zones. If the only use of the structure will be residential and if two or more units are being added, then the Director may authorize reduction or waiver of parking if:  1. The topography of the lot or location of existing structures makes provision of an off-street parking space physically infeasible in a conforming location; or

 2. The site is located in a residential parking zone (RPZ) and a current parking study is submitted showing a utilization rate of less than 75 percent for on-street parking within 400 feet of all property lines of the site.

 3. This exception does not apply to sites located in either the University District Parking Overlay Area (Map A for 23.54.015) or the Alki Area Parking Overlay (Map B for 23.54.015).

~~1.~~4. For the purposes of this section, "existing structures" means those structures that were established under permit, or for which a permit has been granted and has not expired as of the applicable date, as follows:

 a. In multifamily zones, August 10, 1982;

 b. In commercial zones, June 9, 1986.

~~2.~~5.  If an existing residential structure in a multifamily or commercial zone has parking that meets the development standards, and the lot area is not increased, one ~~(1)~~ unit may be added without additional parking. If two ~~(2)~~ units are added, one ~~(1)~~ space will be required; three ~~(3)~~ units will require two ~~(2)~~ spaces, etc. Additional parking must meet all development standards for the particular zone.

~~3.~~6.  In a Lowrise Duplex/Triplex zone:

 a. When an existing residential structure provides less than one ~~(1)~~ parking space per unit, one ~~(1)~~ parking space is required for each additional dwelling unit when dwelling units are added to the structure or the structure is altered to create additional dwelling units;

 b. When an existing nonresidential structure is partially or completely converted to residential use, then no parking space shall be required for the first new dwelling unit, provided that the lot area is not increased and existing parking is screened and landscaped to the greatest extent practical.

 Additional parking provided shall meet all development standards for the Lowrise Duplex/Triplex zone.

~~4.~~7. If an existing structure does not conform to the development standards for parking, or is occupied by a nonconforming use, no parking space is required for the first new or added dwelling unit, provided:

 a. The lot area is not increased and existing parking is screened and landscaped to the greatest extent practical.

 b. Additional parking provided shall meet all development standards for the particular zone.

 c. This exception ~~shall~~does not apply in Lowrise Duplex/Triplex zones.

 * * *

 F. Reductions to Minimum Parking Requirements for Nonresidential Uses.

 1. Reductions to minimum parking requirements permitted by this subsection will be calculated from the minimum parking requirements in Section 23.54.015. Total reductions to required parking as provided in this subsection may not exceed ~~forty (40)~~40 percent.

 2. Transit Reduction.

 a. In NC zones and C zones, except pedestrian- designated zones, and in the Seattle Mixed (SM) zone, except on Class 1 Pedestrian Streets, the minimum parking requirement for a nonresidential use, except institutions, may be reduced by ~~twenty (20)~~20 percent when the use is located within ~~eight hundred (800)~~800 feet of a street with midday transit service headways of ~~fifteen (15)~~15 minutes or less in each direction. This distance will be the walking distance measured from the nearest bus stop to the property line of the lot containing the use.

b. In multifamily, NC and C zones the minimum parking requirement, where applicable outside of urban centers, for a residential use may be reduced by 20 percent when the use is located within 800 feet of a street with midday transit service headways of 15 minutes or less in each direction. This distance will be the walking distance measured from the nearest bus stop to the property line of the lot containing the use.

 A. Height Measurement Technique in All Zones Except Downtown Zones and

 Within the South Lake Union Hub Urban Village.

 1. Except as provided for multifamily zones in subsection 2,~~The~~ height shall be measured at the exterior walls of the structure. Measurement shall be taken at each exterior wall from the existing or finished grade, whichever is lower, up to a plane essentially parallel to the existing or finished grade. For determining structure height, the exterior wall shall include a plane between supporting members and between the roof and the ground. The vertical distance between the existing grade, or finished grade, if lower, and the parallel plane above it shall not exceed the maximum height of the zone.

 2. In multifamily zones, when measuring height for interior facades facing parking area below existing grade and perimeter facades when a driveway providing access to parking below existing grade is located between the perimeter facade and a property line, the height shall be measured from the existing grade when the area is screened according to the provisions of 23.45.524 (see Exhibit A for 23.86.006, Height Measurement for Interior Facades Facing Parking Areas and Driveways).

[Exhibit A for 23.86.006, Height Measurement for Interior Facades Facing Parking Areas and Driveways](/~ordpics/116534Exhibit A for 23.86.006.gif)

~~2~~3. When finished grade is lower than existing grade, in order for an upper portion of an exterior wall to avoid being considered on the same vertical plane as a lower portion, it must be set back from the lower portion a distance equal to two ~~(2)~~ times the difference between existing and finished grade on the lower portion of the wall (Exhibit 23.86.006 A1).

~~3~~4. Depressions such as window wells, stairwells for exits required by other codes, "barrier free" ramps on grade, and vehicle access driveways into garages shall be disregarded in determining structure height in determining structure height when in combination they comprise less than ~~fifty percent (50%)~~50 percent of the facade on which they are located. When features are disregarded,~~In such cases,~~ the grade for height measurement purposes shall be a line between the grade on either side of the depression.

~~4.~~5. No part of the structure, other than those specifically exempted or excepted under the provisions of the zone, shall extend beyond the plane of the maximum height limit.

~~5.~~6. Underground portions of structures are not included in height calculations. The height of structures shall be calculated from the point at which the sides meet the surface of the ground.

 1. The existing grade of the lot shall be established by the elevations of the perimeter lot lines of the lot.

 2. To determine the amount of gross floor area ~~which~~that is below grade, find the point where the ceiling or other point, as specified in the applicable chapter, of each floor intersects the existing grade elevation. Draw a line perpendicular to the point of intersection. All gross floor area behind this line ~~shall be~~is considered below-grade (see Exhibit 23.86.007 A).

 B. Public rights-of-way ~~shall not be~~are not considered part of a lot when

 calculating floor area ratio; ~~provided~~except that when dedication of right-of-way is required, permitted floor area ~~ratio shall be~~is calculated ~~before the dedication is made~~including the area dedicated in lot area.

 Section 83. Section 23.86.012 of the Seattle Municipal Code, which section was last amended by Ordinance 115326, is amended as follows:

 23.86.012 Setbacks in multifamily zones.

 A. Front Setbacks.

 1. Determining Front Setbacks~~Requirements. Front setback requirements are presented in the development standards for each zone.~~ Where the minimum required front setback is to be determined by averaging the setbacks of structures on either side of the subject lot, the following provisions ~~shall~~ apply:

 a. The required ~~depth of the~~ front setback ~~shall be~~is the average of the distances between principal structures and front lot lines of the nearest principal structures on each side of the subject lot if each of those structures is on the same block front as the subject lot and is within 100 feet of the side lot lines of the subject lot (Exhibit 23.86.012 A).

~~b. The setbacks used for front setback averaging shall be on the same block front as the subject lot, and shall be the front setbacks of the nearest principal structures within one hundred (100) feet of the side lot lines of the subject lot.~~

b. When the first principal structure within 100 feet of a side lot line of the subject lot is not on the same block front or when there is no principal structure within 100 feet of the side lot line, the setback depth used for averaging purposes on that side is 10 feet.

c. For averaging purposes, front setback depth ~~shall be~~is~~measured~~the shortest distance from the front lot line to the nearest wall or, where there is no wall, the plane between supports ~~which~~that span~~comprises twenty (20)~~20 percent or more of the width of the front facade of the principal structure ~~on either side~~. Attached garages and enclosed porches ~~shall be~~are considered part of the principal structure for measurement purposes. Decks less than ~~eighteen (18)~~18 inches above existing grade, uncovered porches, eaves, attached solar collectors and other similar parts of the structure ~~shall not be~~are not considered part of the principal structure. ~~When the front facade of the principal structure is not parallel to the front lot line, the shortest distance from the front lot line to the structure shall be used for averaging purposes.~~

 d. When there is a dedication of street right-of-way to bring the street abutting the lot closer to the minimum widths established in Section 23.53.015, for averaging purposes the amount of dedication ~~shall be~~is subtracted from the front setbacks of the structures on either side.

~~e. When the first principal structure within one hundred feet (100') of a side lot line of the subject lot is not on the same block front or when there is no principal structure within one hundred feet (100') of the side lot line, the setback depth used for averaging purposes on that side shall be ten feet (10').~~

~~f.~~e. When the front setback of the first principal structure within ~~one hundred feet (100')~~100 feet of the side lot line of the subject lot exceeds ~~twenty feet (20')~~20, the setback depth used for averaging purposes on that side ~~shall be~~is~~twenty feet (20')~~20 feet.

~~g.~~f. In cases where the street is very steep or winding, the Director ~~shall~~will determine which adjacent structures should be used for averaging purposes.

~~h.~~g. In the case of a through lot, the ~~requirement for~~ front setback ~~shall be~~is determined independently for each street frontage. The measurement techniques of this section ~~shall be applied for~~apply to each street frontage separately.

~~i.~~h. For ~~cluster~~~~development~~multiple structures on the same lot, the front setback of a principal structure on the same lot may be used for averaging purposes.

 2. Front Setback Averaging. In certain zones the required front setback may be averaged. In such cases the following provisions ~~shall~~ apply:

 a. The average distance from the front lot line to the facade ~~shall~~must satisfy the minimum front setback requirement. The front setback ~~shall be~~ is averaged for the entire width of the structure, except that areas ~~which~~that are farther than three ~~(3)~~ times the required front setback from the front lot line ~~shall not be~~are not calculated in the front setback.

 b. Portions of the facade at existing grade ~~shall be~~are used in determining the average setback.

 c. Projections of the front facade ~~which~~that begin at least ~~eight feet (8')~~8 feet above finished grade and project ~~four feet (4')~~4 feet or less from the lower portion of the facade ~~shall not be~~are not included in ~~the~~ setback averaging. For such projections ~~which~~ that project more than ~~four feet (4')~~4 feet from the lower portion of the facade, only the first ~~four feet (4')~~~~shall be~~4 feet is exempt from the averaging calculation. This provision applies to such features as cantilevered floor area, decks, and bay windows. Eaves, gutters and cornices are not~~permitted to project eighteen inches (18") beyond any front facade without being~~ counted in averaging.

 3. Measuring Street-facing Setbacks for Institutions and Public Facilities in Multifamily Zones.

 a. In multifamily zones, the depth of setback from a street lot line may be averaged along the width and height of the facade ~~for institutions and public facilities, as an alternative~~ providing greater design flexibility than standard modulation requirements.

 b. This average setback ~~shall be~~is calculated by dividing the three ~~(3)~~ dimensional volume of setback by the area of the structure facade.

 (1) Find the sum of volumes within the space defined by extension of the roof line, the planes of the side walls, and the vertical extension of the front lot line; and

 (2) Divide this sum by the area of the street-facing facade, calculated as the product of facade height and facade width (Exhibit 23.86.012 B)

~~B. Rear Setbacks. In Midrise zones applicants are given an option in multifamily zones to provide a minimum rear setback of ten feet (10') which must be modulated, or an averaged rear setback of at least fifteen feet (15'). The following provisions shall apply when the applicant has chosen to provide an averaged rear setback of at least fifteen feet (15'):~~1. All projections of the facade shall be included in averaging the rear setback, with the exception of eaves, gutters and cornices which project eighteen inches (18") or less from the facades.

 2. The rear setback shall be averaged for the entire width of the structure.

 C.

B. Side Setbacks.

~~1. Side setbacks requirements are presented in the standard development requirements for each zone. Side setback requirements are based on the height and the depth of a structure. Where two (2) or more structures are connected by elevated walkways, structure depth shall be determined by the combined depth of the structures connected by the elevated walkway, not including the walkway itself.~~2. Side Setback Averaging. In certain cases where specifically permitted, the

When a side setback requirement ~~may be satisfied by~~includes averaging the distance from side lot line to structure facade for the depth of the structure ~~. In those cases the following provisions shall apply~~the following applies:

~~a.~~1. The side setback ~~shall be~~is measured horizontally from side lot line to the side facade of the structure.

~~b.~~2. The~~is~~ side setback ~~shall be~~is averaged for the entire depth of the structure, except that areas ~~which~~that are farther than two ~~(2)~~ times the required average side setback from the side lot line ~~shall not be~~are not counted as part of the side setback (Exhibit 23.86.012 C.)

~~C. Setbacks~~D. Separations Between Structures ~~in Cluster Developments~~on Lots With Multiple Structures. Required ~~setbacks in cluster developments~~separations between structures are specified in each multifamily zone. In certain cases, the ~~setback~~ requirement may be satisfied by averaging the distance between the portions of the facades ~~which~~that  face each other. In those cases the following ~~provisions apply~~applies:

 1. The ~~setback shall be~~separation is measured horizontally from one ~~(1)~~ facade to the other.

 2. The ~~setback shall be~~separation is averaged across the width of those portions of the facades which face each other.

 1. Modulation width ~~shall be~~is the width of a facade segment between the points at which adjacent segments begin to step forward or back (Exhibit 23.86.020 A).

 2. Balconies and decks ~~shall be~~are considered to be projections of the facade for the purpose of measuring modulation width.

 3. The stepping forward or back ~~in the~~of a facade between which modulation width is measured shall be sufficient to satisfy ~~the~~any minimum modulation requirements for width and depth in the applicable Chapter. ~~specified in the standard development requirements for the appropriate multi-family zone.~~ Steps in the facade ~~which~~that do not satisfy minimum modulation width or depth requirements ~~shall not be~~are not considered to form a separate facade segment for the purpose of measuring maximum permitted facade areas~~modulation width, until such steps cumulatively satisfy the minimum dimension required~~.

~~4. In cases where the design of a structure is so unusual that the above provisions cannot be applied; for example, for wedge-shaped or curved facade projections; the Director shall determine when modulation requirements have been met.~~

 B. Modulation Depth.

 1. Modulation depth ~~shall be~~is the distance a facade segment steps forward or back from an adjacent facade segment (Exhibit 23.86.020 B).

 2. Balconies and decks ~~shall be~~are considered to be projections of the facade for the purpose of measuring modulation depth.

~~4. In cases where the design of the structure is so unusual that the above provisions cannot be applied, the Director shall determine when modulation requirements have been met.~~

~~C. Calculating Maximum Permitted Modulation Width. The maximum width of modulation is prescribed in the standard development requirements for each multi-family zone. In those cases for which the maximum modulation width may be increased if the modulation depth is increased, the following provisions shall apply:~~1. When the depth of modulation provided allows the structure to qualify for increased modulation width, each adjacent facade segment shall qualify for the increased width, each adjacent facade segment shall qualify for the increased width (Exhibit 23.86.020 C).

 2. When a facade segment is bounded by two (2) modulated segments of differing depths, the maximum modulation width shall be determined by the greater of the two modulation depths (Exhibit 23.86.020 D).

C. In cases where the design of a structure is so unusual that the above provisions cannot be applied; for example, for wedge- shaped or curved facade projections; the Director will determine when requirements have been satisfied.

The applicant shall demonstrate to the Director the extent to which the applicant has complied with the commitment to meet the green building performance requirements no later than 90 days after issuance of final Certificate of Occupancy for the new structure, or such later date as may be allowed by the Director for good cause. Performance is demonstrated through an independent report from a third party.  i. For projects using the Built Green Multi- family Program the report will be produced by the Master Builders Association of King and Snohomish Counties or another independent entity approved by the Director and submitted by the applicant to the Director.

 ii. For projects using a LEED rating system, the report will be produced by the U.S. Green Building Council or another independent entity approved by the Director and submitted by the applicant to the Director.

 iii. For purposes of this section, if the Director approves a commitment to achieve a substantially equivalent standard, the terms "LEED Silver rating" or "Built Green 4-Star" shall mean such other standard.

b. Failure to submit a timely report regarding the green building performance rating from an approved independent entity by the date required is a violation of the Land Use Code. The penalty for such violation shall be $500 per day from the date when the report was due to the date it is submitted, without any requirement of notice to the applicant.

c. Failure to demonstrate, through an independent report as provided in this subsection, full compliance with the applicant's commitment to meet a green building performance requirement, is a violation of the Land Use Code. The penalty for each violation is assessed on a pass or fail basis and is based on a percentage of construction value at an amount determined as follows:

P = CV x 0.01,where:P is the penalty;CV is the Construction Value as set forth on the building permit for the new structure.

d. Failure to comply with the applicant's commitment to meet green building performance requirements is a violation of the Land Use Code independent of the failure to demonstrate compliance; however, such violation shall not affect the right to occupy any chargeable floor area, and if a penalty is paid in the amount determined under subsection E2 of this section, no additional penalty shall be imposed for the failure to comply with the commitment.

e. If the Director determines that the report submitted provides satisfactory evidence that the applicant's commitment is satisfied, the Director shall issue a certificate to the applicant so stating. If the Director determines that the applicant did not demonstrate compliance with its commitment to meet green building performance requirements in accordance with this section, the Director may give notice of such determination, and of the calculation of the penalty due, to the applicant.

f. If, within 90 days, or such longer period as the Director may allow for good cause, after initial notice from the Director of a penalty due under this subsection, the applicant shall demonstrate, through a supplemental report from the independent entity that provided the initial report, that it has made sufficient alterations or improvements to earn the required green building performance rating, then the penalty owing shall be eliminated or recalculated accordingly. The amount of the penalty as so re- determined shall be final. If the applicant does not submit a supplemental report in accordance with this subsection by the date required under this subsection, then the amount of the penalty as set forth in the Director's original notice shall be final.

g. Any owner, other than the applicant, of any lot on which the bonus development was obtained or any part thereof, shall be jointly and severally responsible for compliance and liable for any penalty due under this subsection.  3. Use of Penalties. A subfund shall be established in the City's General Fund to receive revenue from penalties under subsection E of this section. Revenue from penalties under that subsection shall be allocated to activities or incentives to encourage and promote the development of sustainable buildings. The Director shall recommend to the Mayor and City Council how these funds should be allocated.

 25.05.675 Specific environmental policies.

 * * *

 M. Parking.

 1. Policy Background.

 a. Increased parking demand associated with development projects may adversely affect the availability of parking in an area.

 b. Parking regulations to mitigate most parking impacts and to accommodate most of the cumulative effects of future projects on parking are implemented through the City's Land Use Code. However, in some neighborhoods, due to inadequate off-street parking, streets are unable to absorb parking spillover. The City recognizes that the cost of providing additional parking may have an adverse effect on the affordability of housing.

 2. Policies.

 a. It is the City's policy to minimize or prevent adverse parking impacts associated with development projects.

 b. Subject to the overview and cumulative effects policies set forth in SMC Sections 25.05.665 and 25.05.670, the decisionmaker may condition a project to mitigate the effects of development in an area on parking; provided that:

 i. No SEPA authority is provided to mitigate the impact of development on parking availability in the downtown zones;

 ii. In the Seattle Mixed (SM) zone and for residential uses located within the Pike/Pine Urban Center Village, the First Hill/Capitol Hill Urban Center ~~Village~~, the University District Northwest Urban Center Village, ~~and the First Hill Urban Center Village,~~and the Station Area Overlay Districtno SEPA authority is provided for the decisionmaker torequire more parking than the minimum required by the Land Use Code;

 iii. Parking impact mitigation for multifamily development, except in the Alki area, as described in subsection M2c below, may be required only where on-street parking is at capacity, as defined by Seattle Transportation or where the development itself would cause on-street parking to reach capacity as so defined.

 c. For the Alki area, as identified on Exhibit 2, a higher number of spaces per unit than is required by SMC Section 23.54.015 may be required to mitigate the adverse parking impacts of specific multifamily projects. Projects that generate a greater need for parking and that are located in places where the street cannot absorb that need -- for example, because of proximity to the Alki Beach Park -- may be required to provide additional parking spaces to meet the building's actual need. In determining that need, the size of the development project, the size of the units and the number of bedrooms in the units shall be considered.

 d. Parking impact mitigation for projects outside of downtown zones may include but is not limited to:

 i. Transportation management programs;

 ii. Parking management and allocation plans;

 iii. Incentives for the use of alternatives to single-occupancy vehicles, such as transit pass subsidies, parking fees, and provision of bicycle parking space;

 iv. Increased parking ratios, except for projects located within the Seattle Mixed (SM) zone, and residential uses located in the Pike/Pine Urban Center Village, the First Hill/ Capitol Hill Urban Center ~~Village~~, the University District Northwest Urban Center Village, ~~or the First Hill Urban Center Village,~~and the Station Area Overlay District; and

 v. Reduced development densities to the extent that it can be shown that reduced parking spillover is likely to result; provided, that parking impact mitigation for multifamily development may not include reduction in development density.

 * * *

 Section 91. The provisions of this ordinance are declared to be separate and severable. The invalidity of any particular provision, or its invalidity as applied in any circumstances, shall not affect the validity of any other provision or the application of the particular provision in other circumstances. To the extent that sections of this ordinance recodify or are incorporated into new or different sections provisions of the Seattle Municipal Code as previously in effect, this ordinance shall be construed to continue such provisions in effect.
