 AN ORDINANCE relating to environmental review of the Alaskan Way Viaduct Replacement Project, and ratifying and confirming certain prior acts.

 WHEREAS, in the 1950s, the City of Seattle and the Washington State Department of Transportation (WSDOT) jointly designed and built the Alaskan Way Viaduct to accommodate passenger and freight mobility into the foreseeable future; and

 WHEREAS, in 2001 the Nisqually earthquake damaged the Alaskan Way Viaduct; and

 WHEREAS, the Alaskan Way Viaduct is at risk of sudden and catastrophic failure in an earthquake and is nearing the end of its useful life; and

 WHEREAS, in January 2009, the Governor, the Mayor, and the King County Executive jointly recommended replacing the Alaskan Way Viaduct with a bored tunnel beneath downtown Seattle; and

 WHEREAS, the State in 2009 enacted RCW 47.01.402, finding that it is urgent to replace the Alaskan Way Viaduct, and directing WSDOT to expeditiously perform preliminary work on the bored tunnel alternative to replace the Alaskan Way Viaduct and directing that the City, State and County departments of transportation be responsible for the components of the Alaskan Way Viaduct Replacement Project (AWVRP) as outlined in the January 2009 agreement; and

 WHEREAS, implementing the AWVRP requires completion of environmental review, including public review of the Supplemental Draft Environmental Impact Statement (SDEIS) and publication of a Final Environmental Impact Statement (Final EIS); and

 WHEREAS, completing the environmental review in a timely manner and on-schedule is critical to project management and funding for the AWVRP; and

 WHEREAS, maintaining the City's co-lead status with WSDOT during environmental review is desirable in order to protect the City's access to project information and ability to shape and influence the Final EIS, including responding to citizens' comments on the SDEIS;

 NOW, THEREFORE,

 BE IT ORDAINED BY THE CITY OF SEATTLE AS FOLLOWS:

 Section 1. The City Council reaffirms that it is essential and beneficial for the City to continue as a co-lead agency under the State Environmental Policy Act (SEPA) for environmental review of the Alaskan Way Viaduct Replacement Project (AWVRP).

 Section 2. It is the policy of the City that the Seattle Department of Transportation (SDOT) continue to act as co-lead under SEPA for the remainder of the AWVRP and that SDOT fulfill all responsibilities, obligations and duties necessary to complete and publish the Final Environmental Impact Statement.

 Section 3. Consistent with Section1 and Section 2 of this Ordinance, the City Council ratifies and confirms Council President Richard Conlin's signature on the Supplemental Draft Environmental Impact Statement as signifying the City's intent to remain co-lead.

 Section 4. This ordinance shall take effect and be in force 30 days from and after its approval by the Mayor, but if not approved and returned by the Mayor within ten days after presentation, it shall take effect as provided by Seattle Municipal Code Section 1.04.020.
