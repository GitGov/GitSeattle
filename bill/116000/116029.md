Seller acknowledges that, notwithstanding anything to the contrary elsewhere herein, Buyer's exercise of its Option is conditioned on due authorization of the Shoreline City Council. Upon exercise of the Option, Buyer shall be obligated to purchase the Property from Seller (subject to the terms, conditions, and any remaining contingencies set forth herein), and Seller shall be obligated to sell the Property to Buyer, for the Purchase Price and in the manner herein set forth.
