 ORDINANCE _________________

 AN ORDINANCE relating to the City's computer network technology; revising a budget proviso that restricts spending of amounts appropriated in the 2007 Adopted Budget for the Technology Infrastructure Optimization project in the Department of Information Technology's Technology Leadership and Governance Budget Control Level; authorizing the carry forward of 2007 appropriation authority for the Technology Infrastructure Optimization project in the Department of Information Technology's Technology Leadership and Governance Budget Control Level into 2008; and restricting spending of the appropriation carried forward.

 .

 WHEREAS, the 2007 Adopted Budget provides $1,030,000 to the Department of Information Technology (DoIT) for the Technology Infrastructure Optimization (TIO) project; and

 WHEREAS, the approach to planning for the TIO project is to develop, in two phases, a comprehensive plan for implementing a migration to an integrated software platform for the City's email and file/print infrastructure; and

 WHEREAS, in adopting the 2007 budget, the City Council approved Green Sheet 96-1-A-1, thereby imposing a budget proviso restricting the expenditure of an appropriation of $1,030,000 in DoIT's 2007 Adopted Budget to $374,000 for planning the TIO project; and

 WHEREAS, the TIO proviso stated the Council's intent to lift the proviso provided that DoIT presents a compelling business case and management plan for the project; and

 WHEREAS, DoIT has provided the Council with a series of research papers addressing issues identified by Council staff; and

 WHEREAS, DoIT has produced a "Summary Business Case," which presents an overview and analysis of all studies and research papers previously provided to the Council, includes a management plan for TIO, and makes recommendations for implementing a migration to an integrated Microsoft email and file/print software platform; and

 WHEREAS, DoIT is ready to begin Phase Two of planning for the TIO project; and

 WHEREAS, the City Council has reviewed DoIT's "Summary Business Case" and finds that it sufficiently documents the case for the preferred alternative but does not include a refined estimate of the cost of the proposed migration to an integrated email and file/print software platform; and

 WHEREAS, the City Council does not plan to approve the proposed migration until it reviews the detailed implementation plan and cost estimate for the proposed migration of email and calendaring functions; NOW, THEREFORE,

 BE IT ORDAINED BY THE CITY OF SEATTLE AS FOLLOWS:

 Section 1. The restriction imposed by the following budget proviso is revised as follows:

 Department Green Sheet # BCL Name/Code

 Department of 96-1-A-1 Technology Leadership Information and Governance/D2200 Technology

 "No more than ~~$374,000~~$500,000 of the money appropriated for 2007 for the Department of Information Technology's (DoIT's) ~~Citywide~~Technology Leadership & Governance BCL may be spent for the Technology Infrastructure Optimization (TIO) project until authorized by a future ordinance. Of the money appropriated for 2007 for DoIT's Technology Leadership & Governance BCL and authorized for the TIO project, no more than the amount needed to accomplish detailed implementation planning and design for the proposed migration to an integrated software platform for the City's email and calendaring infrastructure may be spent until authorized by a future ~~Council resolution~~ordinance. The Council anticipates that ~~such~~the authorization to spend more than allowed in the preceding provisos will be provided only ~~if the Department provides a compelling business case and management plan for the project~~after the Council has reviewed the detailed implementation plan and cost estimate for the proposed migration to an integrated software platform for the City's email and calendaring infrastructure."

 Section 2. Subject to the provisos contained in Section 1 of this ordinance, any unspent and unencumbered portion of the $1,030,000 appropriated in the 2007 Adopted Budget for the TIO project in DoIT's Technology Leadership and Governance Budget Control Level shall not lapse at the end of 2007 but shall automatically carry forward into 2008 until fully expended, abandoned or reappropriated; provided that the appropriation shall lapse at the end of 2008 unless carried forward further by a future ordinance.

 Section 3. This ordinance shall take effect and be in force thirty (30) days from and after its approval by the Mayor, but if not approved and returned by the Mayor within ten (10) days after presentation, it shall take effect as provided by Municipal Code Section 1.04.020.

 Passed by the City Council the ____ day of _________, 2007, and signed by me in open session in authentication of its passage this _____ day of __________, 2007.
