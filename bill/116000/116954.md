A distributor may be exempted from the requirements of SMC 6.255.090 (Opt-Out Registry), SMC 6.255.100 (Recovery Fee), and SMC 6.255.110 A and B (Distribution Requirements) if the distributor can demonstrate to the satisfaction of the Director of Seattle Public Utilities that it has established an effective program to ensure delivery of yellow pages phone books to only those residents and businesses who affirmatively request to receive delivery of yellow pages phone books.
