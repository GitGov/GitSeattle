 WHEREAS, the City resolves to mitigate the hardship of those City workers with dependent children experiencing childcare facility and school closures related to a pandemic emergency, and those City workers required to use sick leave for absences from work for health reasons during a pandemic emergency.

 NOW, THEREFORE,

 Section 1. Seattle Municipal Code 4.24.035 shall be amended to read as follows:

 SMC 4.24.035 Paid Sick Leave - Use

 ***

E. An officer's or employee's request for paid sick leave may be granted by the appointing authority or a designated management representative when the officer or employee is required to be absent from work upon cancellation of his or her child's school, daycare facility, or other childcare service or program due to public health reasons related to a pandemic emergency declared by the Local Health Officer or the Washington State Secretary of Health. Sick leave used for such purpose shall only be authorized for the duration of the cancellation, and for the employee to care for a child who is under the age of eighteen and who is a foster, biological, adopted or step child of the employee or the employee's spouse or domestic partner, or a legal ward or a child for whom the employee or his or her spouse/domestic partner stands in loco parentis and whose school or daycare or childcare service has been cancelled due to public health reasons related to a pandemic emergency.

 Section 2. Seattle Municipal Code 4.24.040 shall be amended to read as follows:

 SMC 4.24.040 Sick Leave Reporting - Payment

A. Compensation for absence of an officer or employee from duty for any reason contemplated in Section 4.24.035 shall be paid upon approval of such absentee's appointing authority or that authority's designee. In order to receive compensation for such absence, an officer or employee shall make himself or herself available for such investigation, medical or otherwise, as such appointing authority or the Personnel Director deems appropriate. Either such appointing authority or the Personnel Director may require a supporting report of a health care professional from the officer or employee. Compensation for absences beyond four (4) days shall be paid only after approval by such absentee's appointing authority or that authority's designee, of a request from the officer or employee supported by a report of the health care professional treating the officer or employee or an individual identified in SMC Section 4.24.035 A2, or by a health care professional selected by the Personnel Director. Upon request by the employing unit, an employee shall provide documentation verifying cancellation of his or her child's school, daycare facility, or other childcare service or program for sick leave use as authorized in SMC 4.24.035 E.  B. The requirements of providing supporting medical documentation from a health care professional set forth in SMC Section 4.24.040A for payment of sick leave authorized under SMC Section 4.24.035A to cover absences greater than four (4) days shall be waived for the duration of a pandemic emergency declared by the Local Health Officer or the Washington State Secretary of Health.
