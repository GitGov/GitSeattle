 D. Outside Urban Centers and Urban Villages. Outside of Urban Centers and Urban Villages, sidewalks are required on an existing street in any of the following circumstances, except as provided in subsection  23.53.006.F~~of this section~~:

On streets designated on the Industrial Streets Landscaping Maps, Exhibits 23.50.016.A and 23.50.016.B, sidewalks are required whenever new lots are created through the platting process, including full and short subdivisions and unit lot subdivisions, and whenever development is proposed. Sidewalks are required only for the portion of the lot that abuts the designated street.

 3. On arterials, except in IG1 and IG2 zones and on lots in IB zones that are not directly across the street from or abutting a lot in a residential or commercial zone, sidewalks are required whenever new lots are created through the platting process, including full and short subdivisions and unit lot subdivisions, and whenever development is proposed. Sidewalks are required only for the portion of the lot that abuts the arterial.

 4. In SF, LDT and L1 zones, sidewalks are required when ten ~~(10)~~ or more lots are created through the platting process, including full and short subdivisions and unit lot subdivisions, and when ten ~~(10)~~ or more dwelling units are developed.

 5. Outside of SF, LDT and L1 zones, except in IG1 and IG2 zones and on lots in IB zones that are not directly across the street from or abutting lot in a residential or commercial zone, sidewalks are required when six ~~(6)~~ or more lots are created through the platting process, including full and short subdivisions and unit lot subdivisions, and when six ~~(6)~~ or more dwelling units are developed.

 6. In all zones, except IG1 and IG2 zones and on lots in IB zones that are not directly across the street from or abutting lot in a residential or commercial zone, sidewalks are required when the following nonresidential uses are developed:

 a. ~~Seven hundred fifty (~~750~~)~~ square feet or more of gross floor area of major and minor vehicle repair uses and multipurpose retail sales; and

 b. ~~Four thousand (~~4,000~~)~~ square feet or more of nonresidential uses not listed in subsection 23.53.006.D.6. a.

 E. Requirements for Pedestrian Walkways in Certain Industrial Zones. In IG1 and IG2 zones, and on lots in IB zones that are not directly across the street from or abutting a lot in a residential or commercial zone, whenever development is proposed on existing streets that do not have curbs, a pedestrian walkway is required, except as provided in subsection 23.53.006.F~~of this section~~.

 F. Exceptions. The following exceptions to pedestrian access and circulation requirements and standards apply:

 1. Projects Exempt from Requirements. Pedestrian access and circulation improvements are not required for the following types of projects:

 a. changes of use;

 b. alterations to existing structures;

 c. additions to existing structures that are exempt from environmental review;

 d. construction of a detached structure accessory to a single-family dwelling unit located in any zone, if the property owner enters into a no- protest agreement, as authorized by RCW Chapter 35.43, to future pedestrian access and circulation improvements and that agreement is recorded with the King County Department of Records and Elections;

e. construction of a single-family dwelling unit on a lot in any zone, if the property owner enters into a no-protest agreement, as authorized by RCW Chapter 35.43, to future pedestrian access and circulation improvements and that agreement is recorded with the King County Department of Records and Elections, and if at least one of the following conditions is met:  1) the lot is located on a block front where there are no existing pedestrian access and circulation improvements within 100 feet of the lot; or

 2) construction of pedestrian access and circulation improvements is not necessary because, for example, the existing right-of-way has suitable width and surface treatment for pedestrian use; or the existing right-of-way has a limited amount of existing and potential vehicular traffic; or the Director anticipates limited, if any, additional development near the lot because the development near the lot is at or near zoned capacity under current zoning designations.

~~d~~f. expansions of surface parking, outdoor storage, outdoor sales and outdoor display of rental equipment of less than ~~twenty (~~20~~)~~ percent of the parking, storage, sales or display area, or number of parking spaces~~.~~; and

~~e~~g. ~~I~~in IG1 and IG2 zones, and on lots in IB zones that are not directly across the street from or abutting a lot in a residential or commercial zone, ~~in addition to the exemptions in subsections F1a through F1d, pedestrian access and circulation improvements are not required for the following types of development~~ the addition of:

~~i.~~1)~~F~~fewer than ten ~~(10)~~ artist's studio dwellings;

~~ii.~~2)~~L~~less than ~~seven hundred fifty (~~750~~)~~ square feet of gross floor area of major and minor vehicle repair uses and multipurpose retail sales; and

~~iii.~~3)~~L~~less than ~~four thousand (~~4,000~~)~~ square feet of gross floor area of nonresidential uses not listed in subsection 23.53.006.F.1. ~~e~~g.2).

 2. Waiver or Modification of Pedestrian Access and Circulation Requirements.

 a. The Director, in consultation with the Director of Transportation, may waive or modify pedestrian access and circulation requirements when one or more of the following conditions are met. The waiver or modification shall provide the minimum relief necessary to accommodate site conditions while maximizing pedestrian access and circulation.

~~i.~~1) Location in an environmentally critical area or buffer makes installation of a sidewalk impractical or undesirable;

~~ii.~~2) The existence of a bridge, viaduct or structure such as a substantial retaining wall in proximity to the project site makes installation of a sidewalk impractical or undesirable;

~~iii.~~3) Sidewalk construction would result in undesirable disruption of existing drainage patterns, or disturbance to or removal of natural features such as significant trees or other valuable and character-defining mature vegetation; or

~~iv.~~4) Sidewalk construction would preclude vehicular access to the lot, for example on project sites where topography would render driveway access in excess of the maximum ~~twenty~~20 percent ~~(20%)~~ slope.

 3. Deviation from Sidewalk Standards. The Director of Transportation may grant a deviation from sidewalk standards specified in the Right-of- Way Improvements Manual through the Deviation Request Process in order to address environmental and sustainability issues through the use of an alternative sidewalk design and/or materials.

4. Notwithstanding any provision of Section 23.76.026, the applicant for a Master Use Permit or a building permit to which the Land Use Code in effect prior to the effective date of the ordinance enacting this subsection F.4 applies may, by written election, use the exemptions in subsections 23.53.006.F.1, F.2, and F.3.

Section 2. Severability. The provisions of this ordinance are declared to be separate and severable. The invalidity of any clause, sentence, paragraph, sub-division, section or portion of this ordinance, or the invalidity of the application thereof to any person or circumstance shall not affect the validity of the remainder of this ordinance, or the validity of its application to other persons or circumstances.

 Section 3. This ordinance shall take effect and be in force 30 days from and after its approval by the Mayor, but if not approved and returned by the Mayor within ten days after presentation, it shall take effect as provided by Municipal Code Section 1.04.020.
