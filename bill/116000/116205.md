 AN ORDINANCE relating to foreclosure prevention; establishing policies for a foreclosure prevention program; clarifying and limiting the authority of the Office of Housing to use a 2008 Budget allowance for the program; imposing a proviso; and ratifying and confirming prior acts.

 WHEREAS, in response to the increase in foreclosures in the City of Seattle, the Office of Housing has created a foreclosure prevention program to assist low-income home owners facing foreclosure by providing stabilization loans; and

 WHEREAS, a foreclosure prevention loan program is within the general purposes of the Low-Income Housing Fund 16400 budget control level, which includes the "Homeownership and Sustainability - 16400 program"; and

 WHEREAS, the City Council desires to clarify the budget authorization for the foreclosure prevention program, while establishing a funding limit and basic policies; NOW, THEREFORE,

 BE IT ORDAINED BY THE CITY OF SEATTLE AS FOLLOWS:

 Section 1. The Office of Housing Foreclosure Prevention Program ("Program") is authorized subject to the terms of this ordinance. The purpose of the Program is to provide stabilization loans to low-income Seattle home owners facing mortgage default or foreclosure. The Program shall be operated consistent with the policies set forth in Section 3 of this ordinance, and in accordance with all applicable laws and regulations. The City Council finds that as a result of the increases in foreclosure activity and in low- income households threatened with foreclosure, assistance consistent with these policies is necessary to protect some low-income households from loss of their homes.

 Section 2. Of the appropriation for the Office of Housing in the Low-Income Housing Fund for the Low-Income Housing Fund 16400 budget control level in the 2008 Budget, no more than $210,000 may be used for the Program, of which $200,000 may be used to fund loans to low-income home owners and up to $10,000 may be paid to nonprofit organizations for administrative or loan origination costs. No amounts may be used for foreclosure prevention assistance outside of the Program.

 Section 3. The Office of Housing shall conduct the Program consistent with the policies in this section.

 A. Nonprofit agencies implementing the Program are permitted to charge the City no more than a 5% administration fee on each loan made under the Program.

 B. The maximum loan amount is $5,000. Loan proceeds will be used to bring the existing mortgage current on a home that is the principal residence of the borrower, or to help the borrower refinance into a mortgage on that home with better interest and terms.

 C. Eligible homes include single family homes, townhomes and condominium units.

 D. The income limit for borrowers is 80% of the area median income for the Seattle-Bellevue area published by the Department of Housing and Urban Development, adjusted for household size.

 E. Loans shall bear 0% interest, shall be secured by a deed of trust and shall be repayable at refinancing or when the home is sold.

 F. Nonprofit agencies providing loans must have evidence of the borrower's ability to pay the mortgage; that is, that total income is sufficient to cover housing and living expenses after mortgage defaults are cured or mortgage is refinanced. The expectation is that borrowers will participate in financial counseling to address underlying financial issues.

 Section 4. Any action pursuant to the authority of this ordinance and after its passage, but prior to its effective date, is hereby ratified and confirmed.

 Section 5. This ordinance shall take effect and be in force thirty (30) days from and after

 its approval by the Mayor, but if not approved and returned by the Mayor within ten (10) days

 after presentation, it shall take effect as provided by Municipal Code Section 1.04.020.

 Passed by the City Council the ____ day of ________________________, 2008, and signed by me in open session in authentication of its passage this _____ day of ___________________, 2008.
