 The project scope of work includes rock scaling and slope stabilization of the hillside along the base road of the Powerhouse-to-Dam access road between the Powerhouse and the first tunnel west of the Powerhouse. On 3/14/2010, a large rock/landslide destroyed three docks and a portion of the access road on Ross Lake. These facilities provided access for powerhouse operations and park services. Work includes constructing two new docks on each side of the slide, and reconstructing the road, once the rock slide area is made safe.

 Boundary Sluice Maintenance Gate Structure

 BCL/Program Name: Power Supply and Environmental Affairs - CIP BCL/Program Code: SCL250

 Project Type: Rehabilitation or Restoration Start Date: 2nd Quarter 2010

 Project ID: 6511 End Date: 1st Quarter 2012

 Location: 10382 Boundary Rd, Metaline, WA 99153

 Neighborhood Plan: Not in a Neighborhood Plan Neighborhood Plan Matrix: N/A

 Neighborhood District: Not in a Neighborhood District Urban Village: Not in an Urban Village

 The project scope of work includes construction of a concrete foundation slab (2 feet thick) and a containment building which will be used for 1 year to contain lead paint being removed during the rehab of the 320 Ton Sluice Maintenance Gate (SMG). Following the use as a containment structure the building will be relocated to a new permanent slab and used as a warehouse in the service area. The containment structure will be constructed after the SMG has been sited on the slab and disassembled. The containment structure will then be removed when the SMG has been remediated and recoated to allow for final assembly of the SMG prior to it being floated and returned to service.
