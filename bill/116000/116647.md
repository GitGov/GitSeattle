 ORDINANCE _________________

 AN ORDINANCE related to the Cannon House, authorizing the Director of Housing to purchase from the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development for $5.8 million the first mortgage note on the Cannon House, to assign or release the note for $5.8 million in a simultaneous transaction with Sea Mar Community Health Center, and to execute agreements and take other actions to facilitate these transactions; declaring an emergency; and ratifying and confirming prior acts, all by a three-fourths vote of the City Council

 WHEREAS, Cannon House, which was developed with assistance from The City of Seattle and other public agencies to serve primarily low-income elderly tenants, is currently owned by John C. Cannon Retirement and Assisted Living Residence ("Owner");

 WHEREAS, the Owner defaulted on a first mortgage note in the amount of approximately $11.5 million ("Note") insured by the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development ("HUD"), and HUD has acquired the Note; and

 WHEREAS, HUD notified the Owner that under federal law, loans in default generally are auctioned publicly; and

 WHEREAS, if the Note is publicly auctioned, the buyer is likely to foreclose on the property and Seattle risks losing a public resource that has provided affordable assisted living in the community, as well as losing the City's junior deed of trust on the property;

 WHEREAS, the Owner approached several potential buyers for the property and has negotiated a sale to Sea Mar Community Health Center ("Sea Mar"), a nonprofit corporation that is presently operating the Cannon House under a contract with the owner, and the sale terms will require that the Note be retired at a substantial discount; and

 WHEREAS, the City of Seattle negotiated with HUD to purchase the note for a reduced sale price of $5.8 million, with the intent that the amount paid to HUD would come from Sea Mar's new financing for purchase of the Cannon House; and

 WHEREAS, Sea Mar has secured a financing commitment from Frontier Bank to purchase the property and will continue to operate Cannon House for low- and moderate-income families; and

 WHEREAS, Sea Mar, in an effort to respond to community concerns, has agreed to put a member of the African American community on the Sea Mar board and establish an African American Advisory Committee; and

 WHEREAS, HUD has extended an offer to sell the mortgage note for a substantially reduced sale price of $5.8 million, conditioned on closing of the purchase by late September, and extension of existing covenants to assure the low-income use of a portion of the property; and

 WHEREAS, concerns about foreclosure have created concerns among current and potential residents and the potential of a stop placement order from the Department of Social and Human Services; and

 WHEREAS, Sea Mar will assume the loans made to Owner by the City Office of Housing and the related Regulatory Agreement, with modifications; NOW, THEREFORE,

 BE IT ORDAINED BY THE CITY OF SEATTLE AS FOLLOWS:

 Section 1. The Director of Housing or her designee (referred to in this ordinance as "Director") is authorized, for and on behalf of the City of Seattle, to purchase the promissory note now held by the United States Department of Housing and Urban Development ("HUD"), in the original principal amount of approximately $11,500,000 (the "Note"), secured by a deed of trust on the property known as the John C. Cannon House at 113 23rd Ave. S., Seattle (the "Property"), for a purchase price of $5.8 million, and to execute, deliver, and perform an agreement with HUD for that purpose. The agreement with HUD shall provide in substance that the obligation of the City to pay for the Note is conditioned upon the immediate availability for that purpose, in escrow, of $5.8 million from a third party purchaser of the Note or of the Property, or shall provide in substance that if payment for the Note is not made the sole consequences are that the agreement is terminated and HUD may sell the Note to another purchaser.

 Section 2. The Director is further authorized, for and on behalf of the City, to cause the transfer of the Note to Sea Mar Community Health Center ("Sea Mar") or its designee for $5.8 million, or to cause the satisfaction of the Note and release of the security for the Note for payment of $5.8 million, in either case through an escrow closing approximately simultaneous with the purchase of the Note by the City, and to direct the transfer of the funds paid by Sea Mar or its designee to HUD or as directed by HUD.

 Section 3. The Director is authorized to execute, deliver, modify and perform such other agreements and instructions, and to take such other actions, as the Director finds reasonably necessary to facilitate the transactions authorized in this ordinance, including, without limitation, modifications to existing City loans secured by the Property and to the related Regulatory Agreement, and a priority agreement satisfactory to Sea Mar's first mortgage lender.

 Section 4. The City Council finds:

 Sea Mar has obtained a bank financing commitment to purchase the Property, which expires on September 25, 2009. HUD requires that the Note purchase be completed in September. The Cannon House is occupied by very low-income, elderly persons in need of licensed assisted living care. If the transaction is not implemented by the end of September, the consequence of not purchasing the HUD loan is likely to include public auction of the mortgage Note, foreclosure and subsequent termination of existing affordability restrictions. Uncertainty about ownership and financial viability of the building during a foreclosure period is likely to result in a decline in occupancy levels that would make it financially infeasible to operate the facility. The occupancy level in the building has declined to 75%, and further decline will jeopardize the ability of the project to support adequate staff to meet licensing requirements and to meet the health and safety needs of residents. Therefore, an emergency exists in which it is necessary for the immediate preservation of the public peace, health or safety that this ordinance become effective without delay.

 Section 5. Any actions pursuant to the authority in this ordinance and taken after the date of passage are hereby ratified and confirmed.

 Section 6. This ordinance shall take effect and be in force immediately upon its approval by the Mayor, but in any event not later than the date determined under SMC Section 1.04.020.
