 AN ORDINANCE relating to drainage services of Seattle Public Utilities (SPU); updating definitions in Section 21.33.010 of the Seattle Municipal Code; amending Section 21.33.030 of the Seattle Municipal Code to adjust drainage rates; and amending Section 21.76.040 of the Seattle Municipal Code to revise credits to low-income drainage customers.

 WHEREAS, drainage rates were last increased on January 1, 2010, as authorized by Ordinance 123172; and

 WHEREAS, in 2008, a new drainage rate design authorized by Resolution 30886 was implemented for the first time, which specifies the funding of a portion of combined sanitary and storm sewer expenses (including some wastewater treatment expense) through drainage rates; and

 WHEREAS, Seattle Public Utilities (SPU) has identified additional infrastructure needs requiring capital funding, including combined sewer overflow projects at Windermere, Genesee and South Henderson, a CSO long term control plan, sewer pipe rehabilitation and flooding control and sanitary sewer capacity; and

 WHEREAS, SPU has completed a rate study showing that existing drainage rates will not provide sufficient revenues to pay the costs of providing drainage services and debt service and that rate increases therefore are required; and

 WHEREAS, credits for qualified low-income customers need to be revised to reflect an increase in drainage rates; and

 WHEREAS, the City updated and revised it Stormwater, Grading, and Drainage Control Code in 2009, as authorized by Ordinance 123105, and such updates require corresponding updates to certain definitions that govern storm drain utility rates and charges; NOW THEREFORE,

 BE IT ORDAINED BY THE CITY OF SEATTLE AS FOLLOWS:

 Section 1. Subsections L and W of Section 21.33.010 of the Seattle Municipal Code are amended as follows:

 SMC 21.33.010 Definitions

 For purposes of this chapter, the words or phrases below shall have the

 following meanings:

 * * *

 L. "Impervious surface" or "impervious ground cover"  means "Impervious surface" as defined in Section 22.801 of the Seattle Municipal Code, as may be amended from time to time.  (( ~~means those hard areas which prevent or retard the entry of water into the soil in the manner that such water entered the soil under natural conditions pre- existent to development, or which cause water to run off the surface in greater quantities or at an increased rate of flow than that present under natural conditions pre-existent to development, including, but not limited to, such surfaces as rooftops, asphalt or concrete paving, driveways, parking lots, walkways, patio areas, storage areas, hardpan, compacted surfaces, or other surfaces which similarly affect the natural infiltration or runoff patterns existing prior to development.~~))

 * * *

 W. "Stormwater performance goals" mean (( ~~the standards for)~~)  minimum requirements for flow control and treatment

 (( ~~1. water quality as shown by total suspended solids;~~

~~2. total volume;~~

~~3. two-year peak volume and duration; and~~

~~4. twenty-five-year peak volume~~)) as appropriate for the drainage discharge point  and thresholds  as more particularly described in the Stormwater Code Chapters 22.800 through 22.808.

 * * *

 Section 2. Section 21.33.030 of the Seattle Municipal Code is amended as follows:

 SMC 21.33.030 Drainage service charges and drainage rates --

 Schedule -- Exemptions.

 A. A drainage service charge is imposed on every parcel within the City, and the owner(s) thereof, except for the following exempted property(ies):

 1. Houseboats and piers;

 2. That portion of a parcel that is submerged. If the parcel is entirely submerged, the entire parcel is exempt. If a portion of the parcel is submerged, only the submerged part will be exempt and the remainder of the parcel shall be billed as all other properties;

 3. City streets;

 4. State of Washington highways, so long as the State of Washington shall agree to maintain, construct and improve all drainage facilities associated with State highways as required by the Utility in conformance with all Utility standards for maintenance, construction and improvement hereafter established by the Utility and so far as such maintenance, construction and improvements shall be achieved at no cost to the Utility or to the City; and

 5. All other streets, so long as such streets provide drainage services in the same manner as City streets and the owner(s) shall agree to maintain, construct and improve all drainage facilities associated with such streets as required by the Utility in conformance with all Utility standards for maintenance, construction and improvement hereafter established by the Utility and so far as such maintenance, construction and improvements shall be achieved at no cost to the Utility or to the City.

 B. The drainage service charge shall be based upon a parcel's estimated contribution to City-wide surface and storm water runoff. A parcel's run-off is estimated based on its size and surface characteristics, including the amount and type of impervious and pervious surface it contains.

 C. Drainage service charges shall be determined as follows:

 1. Small single-family residential properties shall be assigned to one of four (4) flat rate categories based on a billable area. Within each category, properties will be charged a uniform annual drainage rate per parcel which is calculated based on an estimated average contribution of surface and storm water runoff for the category. The applicable drainage rate shall equal the drainage service charge.

 2. General service and large residential properties shall be assigned to a rate category based on the estimated percent of impervious surface contained within the parcel. Subsequently, properties assigned to the "undeveloped," "light," and "moderate" rate categories that also contain sufficient quantities of highly infiltrative pervious surface cover to meet Utility-defined performance requirements shall be assigned to a "low impact" rate category. A separate drainage rate shall apply to each general service and large residential rate category. The drainage service charge shall be calculated by multiplying the drainage rate, as determined by the parcel's rate category assignment, by the parcel's billable area (rounded to the nearest whole number of a square foot and divided by one thousand). For condominiums, the drainage service charge shall be determined for the entire parcel and then divided evenly among the owners. Present use code, site visits, planimetric maps based on aerial photography, and other information shall be used to estimate the percentage of impervious area.

 D. Drainage rates used in the calculation of drainage service charges shall be the sum of the treatment rate and the system rate, as follows:

 1. Treatment rate: The "treatment rate" shall be the rate required to pay the drainage share of "treatment cost" which is the cost of wastewater treatment, interception and disposal service, and any associated costs necessary to meet Drainage and Wastewater Fund policies. The treatment rate shall be the amount obtained when (a) the projected drainage treatment cost for each rate category is divided by (b) the projected number of billing units in each rate category and the result is multiplied by (( ~~sixteen and three-tenths percent (116.3%)~~))  one hundred eighteen percent (118.0%)  to cover the costs of taxes ,  (( ~~and~~)) low income rate assistance  and other allowances . The projected treatment cost shall be the treatment cost anticipated for the upcoming calendar year, which may include an adjustment to reflect the difference, whether positive or negative, between the drainage share of expected total treatment cost for the current year and the total drainage service charge revenues attributable to the treatment rate expected for the current year. The treatment rate is designed to pass through cost changes driven by King County and may be adjusted by ordinance at any time in response to such charges.

 2. System rate: The "system rate" shall be the rate required to fund the expense associated with operating, maintaining, and constructing the City's surface and stormwater management system, including any share of combined sanitary and stormwater system expense assigned to drainage.

 3. The rate categories and the corresponding annual drainage rates are as follows:

</table> 4. SPU shall provide a 10% reduction in the drainage service charge for parcels containing new or remodeled commercial buildings that, after July 27, 2003, install and utilize rainwater harvesting systems that meet the performance requirement that the systems are sized to use the amount of rain that falls on the roofs of such buildings during a one year, 24-hour storm event. A system that involves indoor uses of rainwater must be permitted by Seattle-King County Department of Health to qualify for the rate reduction. A system that relies solely on the capture and indoor use of rainwater shall qualify for the drainage service charge reduction only if the system is sized to meet the performance requirement stated above. Qualifying for the drainage service charge reduction does not relieve the property owner from the obligation to comply with applicable stormwater and drainage code requirements for the buildings and site.

 5. Open space properties or parcels shall be charged only for the area of impervious surface and at the rate under which the parcel is classified using the total parcel acreage.

 E. Each bill shall be rounded to the nearest cent. The minimum annual drainage service charge shall be Five Dollars ($5) per parcel.
