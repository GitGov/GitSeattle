 AN ORDINANCE relating to land use and zoning; amending Sections 23.41.010, 23.41.014, 23.55.030, and 23.73.010 of the Seattle Municipal Code, adding a new subsection to Section 23.41.12, approving and adopting revised Neighborhood Design Guidelines for the Pike/Pine Urban Center Village, and amending provisions in the Pike/Pine Conservation Overlay District to better maintain the character of the Pike/Pine neighborhood.

 WHEREAS, in response to the 1991 Pike/Pine Planning Study sponsored and conducted by a coalition of Pike/Pine neighborhood and civic groups, business and property owners, and residents, the Pike/Pine Overlay District was established to preserve and enhance the area's mixed-use character; and

 WHEREAS, in March 1999, the City Council adopted Ordinance 119413 amending the City's Comprehensive Plan to include key goals and policies from the 1998 Pike/Pine Urban Center Village Plan, which reaffirmed the neighborhood's commitment to mixed-use development, while identifying additional priorities including: 1) sustaining the character of Pike/Pine through implementation of urban design recommendations and policy changes and 2) considering a "conservation district" for the neighborhood; and

 WHEREAS, in September 2000, the City Council adopted Ordinance 120081 adopting Neighborhood Design Guidelines for the Pike/Pine Urban Center Village; and

 WHEREAS, in July 2009, the City Council adopted Ordinance 123020, renaming the overlay district the Pike/Pine Conservation Overlay District, expanding its boundaries, and adding provisions that limit the scale of new projects, encourage new projects to retain existing structures as part of a development site, provide spaces for small businesses at street level, and accommodate facilities serving the arts, to further the preservation and enhancement of the unique character of the Pike/Pine neighborhood; and

 WHEREAS, additional design guidelines for Pike/Pine and greater involvement of the Design Review Board will encourage new buildings and signage that contribute to the character of the Pike/Pine neighborhood and help maintain "character structures" that are incorporated into new developments;

 WHEREAS, the Department of Planning and Development is updating the 15 year old citywide design guidelines on which all neighborhood design guidelines are based, and this effort provides an opportunity to reorganize the Pike/Pine Neighborhood Design Guidelines to match the new citywide format, and to update the illustrations in the Pike/Pine Neighborhood Design Guidelines; NOW THEREFORE,

 2) Evaluate the relationship of the character structure's key architectural and structural elements to the developed context, and how the new project will respond to this relationship; and

 3) Evaluate the character structure's key architectural and structural elements and how the new project will maintain those elements by retaining the character structure or reflecting those elements in the new structure, or both.
