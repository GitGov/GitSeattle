 AN ORDINANCE relating to the City Light Department; authorizing the Superintendent or his designee to enter into a seventeen-year power purchase agreement with the Bonneville Power Administration and related agreements.

 WHEREAS, for many years, City Light has purchased power from the Bonneville Power Administration ("BPA") to meet a portion of its electric load, and is currently under a 2000 power sales contract that will expire September 30, 2011; and

 WHEREAS, BPA plays a key role in the economy and environment of the Pacific Northwest by providing revenues from the sale of electricity at cost to pay the annual and capital expenses of the Federal Columbia River Power System, including substantial fish and wildlife restoration costs and debt service to the United States Treasury to repay the Federal government's investments in the system; and

 WHEREAS, BPA initiated its Regional Dialogue Policy implementation process in 2006, which is expected to continue to at least the end of 2008, to discuss the terms and conditions under which it will offer power to its preference customers after the current power supply contracts expire; and

 WHEREAS, since the total regional electrical load for BPA's public preference customers is expected to exceed the total amount of energy available from the current Federal Power System after FY 2011, BPA's Regional Dialogue Policy includes a tiered power rate design that allocates the lowest cost Federal System energy ("Tier 1") to its public preference customers according to a "High Water Mark" assigned to each utility by BPA; and

 WHEREAS, City Light staff have recommended that City Light purchase the maximum amount of its High Water Mark (approximately 530 average megawatts of electricity) from BPA under a Regional Dialogue power purchase agreement under BPA's Tier 1 rate, as well as, upon a determination of need, some amount of additional power to serve City Light's net power requirements above its High Water Mark at one or more of BPA's Tier 2 rates; and

 WHEREAS, BPA intends to offer the proposed Regional Dialogue power purchase agreement on or around September 1, 2008, with the expectation that its preference customers will review, analyze, select, execute and return their preferred product contract so that BPA can execute all customers' Regional Dialogue contracts by December 1, 2008; and

 WHEREAS, BPA requires a related creditworthiness agreement with purchasers of the Slice product; and

 WHEREAS, City Light recommends continuing to purchase power from BPA, both because it is expected to be less costly than other sources of power and because doing so will help further the City's economic and environmental policy objectives; and

 WHEREAS, the City has determined that because (a) power purchased from BPA under the agreement will come from existing, operating projects, and (b) that agreement provides protections to the City in the event that no electricity is available for a long period, entering into the agreement is reasonable and necessary to enable the City to gain the advantages of the agreement; and

 WHEREAS, budget authority and necessary staffing for negotiating and implementing these new agreements will be included in the Mayor's Proposed 2009 - 2010 Budget, as well as the Mayor's subsequent budget proposals; NOW, THEREFORE,

 BE IT ORDAINED BY THE CITY OF SEATTLE AS FOLLOWS:

 Section 1. The Superintendent of the City Light Department, or his designee, is hereby authorized to enter into a seventeen-year power purchase agreement and related creditworthiness agreement with BPA. These agreements, which are still under negotiation, may include a Block Power Sales Agreement, or a Block and Slice Power Sales Agreement and a Creditworthiness Agreement similar to the forms attached to this ordinance as Attachments 1, 2, and 3, respectively. As BPA's final power products have not yet been defined, and correspondingly, City Light has not yet made a determination regarding which BPA power product, or combination of BPA power products, will best suit the utility's needs, the power sales agreement may include purchases of one or more BPA power products, including the Slice, Shaped Block, Shaped Block with Shaping Capacity, or the annual flat Block. Accordingly, the Superintendent of City Light or his designee is hereby authorized to sign a final Regional Dialogue power purchase agreement with BPA that in his view best meets the needs of City Light, as well as any other related contracts, including but not limited to a creditworthiness agreement, that he deems are reasonably necessary to implement the BPA power purchase agreement.

 Section 2. Any act consistent with the authority of this ordinance that is taken after its passage but prior to its effective date is hereby ratified and confirmed.

 Section 3. This ordinance shall take effect and be in force thirty (30) days from and after its approval by the Mayor, but if not approved and returned by the Mayor within ten (10) days after presentation, it shall take effect as provided by Municipal Code Section 1.04.020.

 Passed by the City Council the ____ day of ________________________, 2008, and signed by me in open session in authentication of its passage this

 _____ day of ___________________, 2008.
