 ORDINANCE _________________

 AN ORDINANCE relating to the City Light Department; authorizing the execution of a 10-year services and power purchase agreement with the Sacramento Municipal Utility District for renewable energy and environmental attributes.

 WHEREAS, the Sacramento Municipal Utility District ("SMUD") is purchasing the capacity, energy output and Environmental Attributes from the Burlington Project, a cogeneration biomass project in Skagit County, Washington; and

 WHEREAS, SMUD requires up to 15 MW of Burlington Net Project Energy, or an equivalent amount of energy from an alternative renewable resource, to be scheduled and delivered to the California-Oregon Border ("COB"); and

 WHEREAS, SMUD desires that the City Light Department ("City Light") schedule the output from the Burlington Project and exchange up to 15 MW of Burlington Net Project Energy; and

 WHEREAS, City Light is willing to deliver up to 15 MW of energy to SMUD at COB in exchange for SMUD deliveries of the equivalent amount of energy to City Light at the SCL/Puget Interface; and

 WHEREAS, City Light is capable of and is amenable to scheduling the output from the Burlington Project; and

 WHEREAS, City Light desires reliable capacity and energy in the winter months and SMUD is capable of providing such capacity and energy in exchange for the services stated above; and

 WHEREAS, City Light desires to acquire any Burlington Net Project Energy and Environmental Attributes that are in excess of 15 MW, and SMUD is capable of providing such energy and Environmental Attributes; NOW THEREFORE,

 BE IT ORDAINED BY THE CITY OF SEATTLE AS FOLLOWS:

 Section 1. The Superintendent of City Light, or his designee, is hereby authorized to execute for and on behalf of the City of Seattle a 10 year Confirmation Agreement for Renewable Energy Scheduling, Delivery, Purchase and Exchange, substantially in the form attached hereto as Attachment 1. This agreement between the Sacramento Municipal Utility District and City Light Department sets forth the terms under which SMUD will receive services from City Light for the scheduling and delivery of new renewable energy to SMUD in exchange for SMUD's delivery of winter energy to City Light, and under which City Light will purchase new renewable energy and environmental attributes from SMUD that are surplus to SMUD's needs.

 Section 2. Any act taken pursuant to the authority of this ordinance and prior to its effective date is hereby ratified and confirmed.

 Section 3. This ordinance shall take effect and be in force thirty (30) days from and after its approval by the Mayor, but if not approved and returned by the Mayor within ten (10) days after presentation, it shall take effect as provided by Municipal Code Section 1.04.020.

 Passed by the City Council the ____ day of _________, 2008, and signed by me in open session in authentication of its passage this _____ day of __________, 2008.

 Attachment 1: Confirmation Agreement for Renewable Energy Scheduling, Delivery, Purchase and Exchange Page 1 of Exchange True-Up of Winter Deliveries by SMUD 3

 Winter MWh for SMUD to Deliver = (Annual Transmission Cost + Opportunity Cost Adder)

 divided by /

 the Dec-Feb Super-Peak COB Power Price

 The formula must yield the negotiated amount of 17,700 MWh when the expected costs as of 03/27/07 (date of verbal agreement) are input.

 CALCULATION USING FIRST YEAR INPUTS:

 Winter MWh for SMUD to Deliver = ( $ 916,929 + $469,830 ) = MWh See Page 3 for 17,700 Details

 $ of First Year Example 78.35

 This calculation will not be revisited for the first year - 17,700 MWh is the number for the first Contract Year.

 The Following Definitions Feed into the Formula:

 Annual Transmission Cost = BPA Demand Charges + Losses Rate x Annual MIDC Price x Annual MWh

 Opportunity Cost Adder = $3.7617/MWh x Annual MWh

 Dec-Feb Super-Peak COB Power Price = 1.16 x Dec-Feb On-Peak COB Power Price

 Dec-Feb On-Peak COB Power Price = The hours weighted average of bid and offer prices for delivery of firm On-Peak energy at COB North to South for the nearest upcoming months of December, January and February as published for the Business Day closest to November 9th (on or before the 9th) just prior to the applicable December through February delivery period by a broker active in the COB power market.

 SMUD shall obtain approval from SCL on which broker to use, or use the average of three different brokers active in the COB market.

 BPA Demand Charges = ((Southern Intertie Demand + Scheduling + Reactive) + (PTP Demand + Scheduling + Reactive)) x 12 Months x 15,000 kW

 Southern Intertie Demand = The BPA Monthly Demand Tariff Rate for Long-Term Southern Intertie Transmission

 PTP Demand = The BPA Monthly Demand Tariff Rate for Long-Term Point-to-Point (Network service) Transmission

 Scheduling = The BPA Monthly Demand Tariff Rate for Scheduling, System Control and Dispatch

 Exhibit C, Page 2 of 3

 Reactive = $ _/kW-Month A fixed assumed number for the BPA Monthly Demand Tariff Rate for Scheduling, 0.067 System Control and Dispatch

 Losses Rate The BPA Tariff Transmission Losses Percentage for the Southern = Intertie

 +

 The BPA Tariff Transmission Losses Percentage for Point-to-Point (Network service)

 Annual MIDC Price = The hours weighted average of all Dow Jones Daily Firm Mid-C Electricity Indices for the most recent historical November through October period, as determined in November for purposes of calculating the Winter Delivery Quantity.

 Annual MWh = The total MWh delivered to SMUD at COB North to South by Seattle during the most recent historical November through October Period, including Make-Up Schedules but excluding any other MWh delivered at a rate above 15 MW, as determined in November for purposes of calculating the Winter Delivery Quantity.

 For the first Contract Year an assumed number based on a 95% Capacity Factor is used.

 Note: the October through November Period is used for the Second Contract year and beyond because it will be the most recent 'known' delivery data at the time that the Winter MWH deliveries are being calculated. For example the Winter MWh for the second contract Year will be calculated on or about November 12, 2008 and we will therefore be able to make use of COB NS delivery data available from the November 2007 through October 2008 period.

 Exhibit C, Page Definitions and Inputs Values for the First Contract 3 of 3 Year:

 Annual Transmission $534,060.00 + (4.90% x $ x 24,898 Cost = 62.56 )

 = $534,060.00 + $382,868.55 = $916,928.55

 Opportunity Cost Adder $ _/MWh X 124,898 $469,830.31 = 3.7617

 Dec-Feb Super-Peak COB Power Price 1.16 x $ = $ 78.35 = 67.54

 Dec-Feb On-Peak COB Power Price = $ 67.54

 BPA Demand Charges = (($1.211/kW-month + $0.203/kW-month + $0.067/kW-month) + ($1.216/kW-month + $0.203/kW-month + $0.067/kW-month)) x 12 Months x 15,000 Kw

 = $ _/kW-Month x 12 Months x 15,000 = $534,060 2.967 kW

 Southern Intertie $ _/kW-Month Demand = 1.211

 PTP Demand = $ _/kW-Month 1.216

 Scheduling = $ _/kW-Month 0.203

 Reactive = $ _/kW-Month A fixed assumed number for the BPA Monthly Demand 0.067 Tariff Rate for Scheduling, System Control and Dispatch

 Losses Rate = 4.90% = 3.00%

 +

 1.90%

 Annual MIDC Price $ _= Average of 03/27/2007 Prebon Broker Quotes for Q2, Q3, Q4 0f 2007 & Q1 of 62.56 2008

 Annual MWh = 15 MW X 8764.8 hours 95% Capacity 124,898 X Factor

 The Expected number was used for the first Contract Year, actual MWh per the definition of Annual MWh will be used in subsequent Contract Years

 Note: The average number of hours per year over the ten-year period was used here rather than 8784 to better define the Opportunity Cost Adder for a ten-year term
