 AN ORDINANCE authorizing an opportunity for eligible City of Seattle employees to convert up to a total of 40 hours of accumulated and unused vacation to cash to benefit the relief efforts on behalf of victims of the 2010 Haiti and Chile earthquakes, and ratifying and confirming certain prior acts.

 WHEREAS, on January 12, 2010 a magnitude 7.0 earthquake in Haiti and on February 27 a magnitude 8.7 earthquake in Chile each created a humanitarian crisis that has prompted a global outpouring of support; and

 WHEREAS, these catastrophic earthquakes have affected an estimated 3 million people in Haiti, a country of 9 million and 2 million in Chile sustaining considerable damage where many are already suffering from poverty, hunger, political instability and previous disasters; and

 WHEREAS, these tragedies have resulted in a dire situation with approximately 200,000 people killed, and has caused an estimated 3.5 million people to be left homeless and without food, clothing, water, or other basics necessary for survival.

 WHEREAS, in response to previous humanitarian crises, the United States Internal Revenue Service determined that it would not assert that donations of cash converted from employee vacation leave balances constituted gross income or wages; and that such donations did not result in constructive receipt of gross income or wages for employees.
