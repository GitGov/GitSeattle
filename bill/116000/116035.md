 SECTION 109

 UNSAFE EQUIPMENT AND HAZARD CORRECTION ORDER

 109.1 Unsafe Equipment. Any equipment regulated by this code which constitutes a fire or health hazard or is otherwise dangerous to human life is, for the purpose of this section, unsafe. Any use of equipment regulated by this code constituting a hazard to safety, health or public welfare by reason of inadequate maintenance, dilapidation, obsolescence, fire hazard, disaster, damage or abandonment is, for the purpose of this section, an unsafe use. Any such unsafe equipment is hereby declared to be a public nuisance and may be abated.

 109.2 Hazard Correction Order. Whenever the code official finds that unsafe equipment exists, the code official may issue a hazard correction order specifying the conditions causing the equipment to be unsafe and directing the owner or other person responsible for the unsafe equipment to correct the condition by a date certain.

The issue of the appeal shall be taken into account by the Chair when selecting members to hear the appeal. The decision of the review panel is advisory only. The final decision on any appealable matter is made by the building official.

 SECTION 111

 RESPONSIBILITY FOR COMPLIANCE

 111.1. General. Compliance with the requirements of this code is the obligation of the owner of the building, structure or premises, the duly authorized agent of the owner, or other person responsible for the condition or work, and not of the City or any of its officers or employees.

 SECTION 112

 VIOLATIONS AND PENALTIES

 112.1 Violations. It is a violation of this code for any person to:

 1. install, erect, construct, enlarge, alter, repair, replace, remodel, move, improve, remove, convert or demolish, equip, occupy, use or maintain any mechanical systems or equipment or cause or permit the same to be done in the City, contrary to or in violation of any of the provisions of this code;

 5. remove, mutilate, destroy or conceal any notice or order issued or posted by the code official pursuant to the provisions of

 this code, or any notice or order issued or posted by the code official in response to a natural disaster or other emergency.

 112.2 Notice of Violation. If, after investigation, the code official determines that standards or requirements of this code have been violated or that orders or requirements have not been complied with, the code official may serve a notice of violation upon the owner, agent or other person responsible for the action or condition. The notice of violation shall state the standards or requirements violated, shall state what corrective action, if any, is necessary to comply with the standards or requirements, and shall set a reasonable time for compliance. The notice shall be served upon the owner, agent or other responsible person by personal service or regular first class mail addressed to the last known address of such person, or if no address is available after reasonable inquiry, the notice may be served by posting it in a conspicuous place on the premises. The notice may also be posted if served by personal service or first class mail. The notice of violation shall be considered an order of the code official, if no request for review before the code official is made pursuant to Section 112.3.

 Nothing in this section limits or precludes any action or proceeding to enforce this chapter, and nothing obligates or requires the code official to issue a notice of violation prior to the imposition of civil or criminal penalties.

 112.3 Review by the code official for notice of violation.

 112.3.1 Any person affected by a notice of violation issued pursuant to Section 112.2 may obtain a review of the notice by making a request in writing within ten days after service of the notice. When the last day of the period computed is a Saturday, Sunday, or City holiday, the period runs until 5:00 p.m. of the next business day.

 The review shall occur not less than ten nor more than twenty days after the request is received by the code official unless otherwise agreed by the person requesting the review.

 Any person aggrieved by or interested in the notice of violation may submit additional information to the code official.

 112.3.2 The review shall be made by a representative of the code official who will review any additional information that is submitted and the basis for issuance of the notice of violation. The reviewer may request clarification of the information received and a site visit. After the review, the code official shall:

 1. Sustain the notice; or

 2. Withdraw the notice; or

 3. Continue the review to a date certain; or

 4. Amend the notice.

 112.3.3 The code official shall issue an order containing the decision within 15 days of the date that the review is completed and shall cause the order to be mailed by regular first class mail to the persons requesting the review and the persons named on the notice of violation, addressed to their last known address.

 112.3.4 Because civil actions to enforce Title 22 SMC are brought in Seattle Municipal Court pursuant to Section 111.4.2, orders of the code official issued under this chapter are not subject to judicial review pursuant to chapter 36.70C RCW.

 112.4 Civil penalties.

 112.4.1. Any person violating or failing to comply with the provisions of this code shall be subject to a cumulative civil penalty in an amount not to exceed $500 per day for each violation from the date the violation occurs or begins until compliance is achieved. In cases where the code official has issued a notice of violation, the violation will be deemed to begin, for purposes of determining the number of days of violation, on the date compliance is required by the notice of violation.

 112.4.2. Civil actions to enforce this chapter shall be brought exclusively in Seattle Municipal Court, except as otherwise required by law or court rule. In any civil action for a penalty, the City has the burden of proving by a preponderance of the evidence that a violation exists or existed; the issuance of the notice of violation or of an order following a review by the code official is not itself evidence that a violation exists.

 112.5 Alternative criminal penalty. Anyone who violates or fails to comply with any order issued by the code official pursuant to this code or who removes, mutilates, destroys or conceals a notice issued or posted by the code official shall, upon conviction thereof, be punished by a fine of not more than $5000 or by imprisonment for not more than 365 days, or by both such fine and imprisonment. Each day's violation or failure to comply shall constitute a separate offense.

 112.6 Additional relief. The code official may seek legal or equitable relief to enjoin any acts or practices and abate any condition when necessary to achieve compliance.

 112.7 Recording of Notices. The code official may record a copy of any order or notice with the Department of Records and Elections of King County. The code official may record with the Department of Records and Elections of King County a notice that a permit has expired without a final inspection after reasonable efforts have been made to provide a final inspection.

 SECTION 113

 RULES OF THE CODE OFFICIAL

 113.1 Authority. The code official has authority to render interpretations of this code and to adopt and enforce rules and regulations supplemental to this code as may be deemed necessary in order to clarify the application of the provisions of this code. Such interpretations, rules and regulations shall be in conformity with the intent and purpose of this code.

 113.2 Procedure for Adoption of Rules. The code official shall promulgate, adopt and issue rules according to the procedures as specified in the Administrative Code, Chapter 3.02 of the Seattle Municipal Code.

 SECTION 114

 CONSTRUCTION CODES ADVISORY BOARD

 A committee of the Construction Codes Advisory Board may examine proposed administrative rules, appeals and amendments relating to this code and related provisions of other codes and make recommendations to the code official and to the City Council for changes in this code. The committee will be called on an as needed basis by the Construction Codes Advisory Board.

 SECTION 115
