 AN ORDINANCE related to land use and zoning, amending Chapter 23.48 and Section 23.54.020 of the Seattle Municipal Code; creating a new SM/D/65-85 zoning classification; and amending the Official Land Use Map at pages 72-73 to rezone land in the West Dravus commercial area to SM/D/65-85.

 WHEREAS the Seattle Comprehensive Plan, policy LU6, provides that "the City Council may permit greater heights on commercially-zoned sites in the Interbay area along and near W. Dravus Street between 15th Avenue W. and 20th Avenue W., through overlay zoning, zoning map amendment, or other implementing measures"; and

 WHEREAS on October 3, 2006 the City Council adopted Resolution 30804 calling for consideration of an overlay zone or other zoning options, including height limit increases, to promote mixed-use development in the W. Dravus Commercial area, and directing the Department of Planning and Development to prepare legislation; and

 WHEREAS the goals of the zoning change in the W. Dravus Commercial area are to preserve and enhance the existing industrial employment base, provide opportunities for higher-density transit oriented development, create workforce housing in a new pedestrian-oriented, mixed use center in proximity to existing open space resources, and to promote a jobs housing balance within a walkable neighborhood; and

 WHEREAS the City Council believes that any transportation infrastructure improvements in the W. Dravus Commercial Area required to serve new mixed use development can be accomplished by mitigation required through the City's substantive authority under the State Environmental Policy Act; and

 WHEREAS proposals for change in zone classification and height limit in the W. Dravus Commercial Area predate consideration of incentive zoning proposals by several years; and

 WHEREAS consequently, a rezone of the W. Dravus commercial area is not to be construed as a precedent for any future City Council actions relating to incentive zoning policy and future area rezones in other parts of the City; NOW, THEREFORE,

 BE IT ORDAINED BY THE CITY OF SEATTLE AS FOLLOWS:
