 ORDINANCE _________________

 AN ORDINANCE relating to the Revenue Stabilization Account of the Cumulative Reserve Subfund; authorizing an increase in the maximum balance allowed in the Revenue Stabilization Account; and amending Seattle Municipal Code Subsection 5.80.020 B in connection therewith.

 WHEREAS, the City's revenue sources are susceptible to sudden unanticipated shortfalls due to a number of factors, including economic downturns, changes in state law governing City revenue, and legal judgments; and

 WHEREAS, sudden downward adjustments to City spending plans mid-way through a fiscal year in response to unanticipated revenue shortfalls can result in unacceptable disruptions to essential City services and operations; and

 WHEREAS, RCW 35.21.070 and Seattle Municipal Code 5.80.010 establish permissible uses of the Cumulative Reserve Subfund, including the provision of reserves for revenue stabilization for future operations; and

 WHEREAS, the Revenue Stabilization Account (RSA) of the Cumulative Reserve Subfund (CRS) was established to support essential City operations during unanticipated shortfalls in the City's budget; and

 WHEREAS, the maximum balance allowed in the RSA is based on a percentage of the amount of tax revenues received by the City during the fiscal year prior to the closed fiscal year; and

 WHEREAS, it is the intent of the Mayor and City Council to avoid mid- year reductions to City spending plans by establishing a reserve that would be used to offset revenue shortfalls, and would be funded by (1) direct appropriations and (2) tax revenues that are greater than anticipated; and

 WHEREAS, raising the maximum allowable balance in the RSA will allow the City to save more, and be in a better position, should it face a sudden economic downturn or revenue shortfall; and

 WHEREAS, the RSA's maximum balance has not been adjusted since it was first established in 1999; NOW, THEREFORE,

 BE IT ORDAINED BY THE CITY OF SEATTLE AS FOLLOWS:

 Section 1. Effective January 1, 2008, Subsection 5.80.020 B of the Seattle Municipal Code is amended as follows:

 5.80.020 Structure of subfund.

 * * *

 B. The Revenue Stabilization Account shall be used for revenue stabilization for future City operations. Expenditures from the Revenue Stabilization Account shall require an ordinance passed by two-thirds vote unless state law requires a higher super majority vote of the City Council. The Revenue Stabilization Account shall be funded by (1) transfers by ordinance, and (2) automatic transfer of tax revenues to the extent described in this section. Upon completion of fiscal year accounting, tax revenues collected during the closed fiscal year which are in excess of the latest revised estimate of tax revenues for that closed fiscal year (as published in the current fiscal year adopted budget) shall automatically be deposited to the Revenue Stabilization Account. Such deposit shall occur at that time the City completes its accounting for the fiscal year. At no time shall the balance of the Revenue Stabilization Account exceed ~~two and one-half (2.5)~~five (5.0) percent of the amount of tax revenues received by the City during the fiscal year prior to the closed fiscal year. For purposes of this paragraph, the phrase "tax revenues" means all tax revenues deposited into the General Subfund, including but not limited to, tax revenue from the regular property tax levy, business and occupation tax, utility business taxes, admissions tax, leasehold excise tax, gambling taxes, and sales and use taxes.

 Section 2. Any acts consistent with the authority and prior to the effective date of this ordinance are hereby ratified and confirmed.

 Section 3. This ordinance shall take effect and be in force thirty (30) days from and after its approval by the Mayor, but if not approved and returned by the Mayor within ten (10) days after presentation, it shall take effect as provided by Municipal Code Section 1.04.020.

 Passed by the City Council the ____ day of _________, 2007, and signed by me in open session in authentication of its passage this _____ day of __________, 2007.
