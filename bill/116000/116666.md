 For purposes of determining whether existing capability on the Transmission Provider's Transmission System is adequate to accommodate a request for firm service under this Tariff, all Completed Applications for new firm transmission service received during the initial sixty (60) day period commencing with the effective date of the Tariff will be deemed to have been filed simultaneously. A lottery system conducted by an independent party shall be used to assign priorities for Completed Applications filed simultaneously. All Completed Applications for firm transmission service received after the initial sixty (60) day period shall be assigned a priority pursuant to Section 13.2.

 2.2 Reservation Priority For Existing Firm Service Customers:

 Existing firm service customers (wholesale requirements and transmission- only, with a contract term of five years or more), have the right to continue to take transmission service from the Transmission Provider when the contract expires, rolls over or is renewed. This transmission reservation priority is independent of whether the existing customer continues to purchase capacity and energy from the Transmission Provider or elects to purchase capacity and energy from another supplier. If at the end of the contract term, the Transmission Provider's Transmission System cannot accommodate all of the requests for transmission service, the existing firm service customer must agree to accept a contract term at least equal to the longest competing request by any new Eligible Customer and to pay the current rate for such service; provided that, the firm service customer shall have a right of first

 refusal at the end of such service only if the new contract is for five years or

 more. The existing firm service customer must provide notice to the Transmission Provider whether it will exercise its right of first refusal no less than one year prior to the expiration date of its transmission service agreement. This transmission reservation priority for existing firm service customers is an ongoing right that may be exercised at the end of all firm contract terms of five years or longer.

 3 Ancillary Services

 Ancillary Services are needed with transmission service to maintain reliability within and among the Control Areas affected by the transmission service. The Transmission Provider is required to provide (or offer to arrange with the local Control Area operator as discussed below), and the Transmission Customer is required to purchase, the following Ancillary Services (i) Scheduling, System Control and Dispatch, and (ii) Reactive Supply and Voltage Control from Generation or Other Sources.

 The Transmission Provider is required to offer to provide (or offer to arrange with the local Control Area operator as discussed below) the following Ancillary Services only to the Transmission Customer serving load within the Transmission Provider's Control Area (i) Regulation and Frequency Response, (ii) Energy Imbalance, (iii) Operating Reserve - Spinning, and (iv) Operating Reserve - Supplemental. The Transmission Customer serving load within the Transmission Provider's Control Area is required to acquire these Ancillary Services, whether from the Transmission Provider, from a third party, or by self-supply. The Transmission Provider is required to provide (or offer to arrange with the local Control Area Operator as discussed below), to the extent it is physically feasible to do so from its resources or from resources available to it, Generator Imbalance Service when Transmission Service is used to deliver energy from a generator located within its Control Area.  The Transmission Customer using Transmission Service to deliver energy from a generator located within the

 Transmission Provider's Control Area is required to acquire Generator Imbalance

 Service, whether from the Transmission Provider, from a third party, or by self-supply. The Transmission Customer may not decline the Transmission Provider's offer of Ancillary Services unless it demonstrates that it has acquired the Ancillary Services from another source. The Transmission Customer must list in its Application which Ancillary Services it will purchase from the Transmission Provider. A Transmission Customer that exceeds its firm reserved capacity at any Point of Receipt or Point of Delivery or an Eligible Customer that uses Transmission Service at a Point of Receipt or Point of Delivery that it has not reserved is required to pay for all of the Ancillary Services identified in this section that were provided by the Transmission Provider associated with the unreserved service. The Transmission Customer or Eligible Customer will pay for Ancillary Services based on the amount of transmission service it used but did not reserve.

 If the Transmission Provider is a public utility providing transmission service but is not a Control Area operator, it may be unable to provide some or all of the Ancillary Services. In this case, the Transmission Provider can fulfill its obligation to provide Ancillary Services by acting as the Transmission Customer's agent to secure these Ancillary Services from the Control Area operator. The Transmission Customer may elect to (i) have the Transmission Provider act as its agent, (ii) secure the Ancillary Services directly from the Control Area operator, or (iii) secure the Ancillary Services (discussed in Schedules 3, 4, 5, 6 and 9) from a third party or by self-supply when technically feasible.

 The Transmission Provider shall specify the rate treatment and all related terms and conditions in the event of an unauthorized use of Ancillary Services by the Transmission Customer.

 The specific Ancillary Services, prices and/or compensation methods are described on the Schedules that are attached to and made a part of the Tariff. Three principal requirements apply to discounts for Ancillary Services provided by the Transmission Provider in conjunction with its provision of transmission service as follows: (1) any offer of a discount made by the Transmission Provider must be announced to all Eligible Customers solely by posting on the OASIS, (2) any customer-initiated requests for discounts (including requests for use by one's wholesale merchant or an Affiliate's use) must occur solely by posting on the OASIS, and (3) once a discount is negotiated, details must be immediately posted on the OASIS. A discount agreed upon for an Ancillary Service must be offered for the same period to all Eligible Customers on the Transmission Provider's system. Sections 3.1 through 3.7 below list the seven Ancillary Services.

 3.1 Scheduling, System Control and Dispatch Service:

 The rates and/or methodology are described in Schedule 1.

 3.2 Reactive Supply and Voltage Control from Generation or Other Sources Service:

 The rates and/or methodology are described in Schedule 2.

 3.3 Regulation and Frequency Response Service:

 Where applicable the rates and/or methodology are described in Schedule 3.

 3.4 Energy Imbalance Service:

 Where applicable the rates and/or methodology are described in Schedule 4.

 3.5 Operating Reserve - Spinning Reserve Service:

 Where applicable the rates and/or methodology are described in Schedule 5.

 3.6 Operating Reserve - Supplemental Reserve Service:

 Where applicable the rates and/or methodology are described in Schedule 6.

 3.7 Generator Imbalance Service:

 Where applicable the rates and/or methodology are described in Schedule 9.

 4 Open Access Same-Time Information System (OASIS)

 In the event transmission capability is insufficient to accommodate a request for firm transmission service, additional studies may be required as provided by this Tariff pursuant to Sections 19 and 32.

 The Transmission Provider shall post on its public website an electronic link to all rules, standards and practices that (i) relate to the terms and conditions of transmission service, (ii) are not subject to a North American Energy Standards Board (NAESB) copyright restriction, and (iii) are not otherwise included in this Tariff. The Transmission Provider shall post on its public website an electronic link to the NAESB website where any rules, standards and practices that are protected by copyright may be obtained. The Transmission Provider shall also post on its public website a statement of the process by which the Transmission Provider shall add, delete or otherwise modify the rules, standards and practices that are not included in this tariff. Such process shall set forth the means by which the Transmission Provider shall provide reasonable advance notice to Transmission Customers and Eligible Customers of any such additions, deletions or modifications, the associated effective date, and any additional implementation procedures that the Transmission Provider deems appropriate.

 5 Tax Exempt Bonds

 5.1 Facilities Financed by Tax Exempt Bonds:

 Notwithstanding any other provision of this Tariff, the Transmission Provider shall not be required to provide transmission service to any Eligible Customer pursuant to this Tariff if the provision of such transmission service would jeopardize the tax-exempt status of any bond(s) used to finance the Transmission Provider's facilities that would be used in providing such transmission service. If the Transmission Provider determines that the provision of transmission service requested by an Eligible Customer would jeopardize the tax-exempt status of any bond(s) used to finance its facilities that would be used in providing such transmission service, it shall so advise the Eligible Customer.

 6 Reciprocity

 A Transmission Customer receiving transmission service under this Tariff agrees to provide comparable transmission service that it is capable of providing to the Transmission Provider on similar terms and conditions over facilities used for the transmission of electric energy owned, controlled or operated by the Transmission Customer and over facilities used for the transmission of electric energy owned, controlled or operated by the Transmission Customer's corporate Affiliates. A Transmission Customer that is a member of, or takes transmission service from, a power pool, Regional Transmission Group, Regional Transmission Organization (RTO), Independent System Operator (ISO) or other transmission organization approved by the Commission for the operation of transmission facilities also agrees to provide comparable transmission service to the transmission-owning members of such power pool and Regional Transmission Group, RTO, ISO or other transmission organization on similar terms and conditions over facilities used for the transmission of electric energy owned, controlled or operated by the Transmission Customer and over facilities used for the transmission of electric energy owned, controlled or operated by the Transmission Customer's corporate Affiliates.

 This reciprocity requirement applies not only to the Transmission Customer that obtains transmission service under the Tariff, but also to all parties to a transaction that involves the use of transmission service under the Tariff, including the power seller, buyer and any intermediary, such as a power marketer. This reciprocity requirement also applies to any Eligible Customer that owns, controls or operates transmission facilities that uses an intermediary, such as a power marketer, to request transmission service under the Tariff. If the Transmission Customer does not own, control or operate transmission facilities, it must include in its Application a sworn statement of one of its duly authorized officers or other representatives that the purpose of its Application is not to assist an Eligible Customer to avoid the requirements of this provision.

 7 Billing and Payment

 7.1 Billing Procedure:

 Within a reasonable time after the first day of each month, the Transmission Provider shall submit an invoice to the Transmission Customer for the charges for all services furnished under the Tariff during the preceding month. The invoice shall be paid by the Transmission Customer within twenty (20) days of receipt. All payments shall be made in immediately available funds payable to the Transmission Provider, or by wire transfer to a bank named by the Transmission Provider.

 7.2 Interest on Unpaid Balances:

 Interest on any unpaid amounts (including amounts placed in escrow) shall be charged at 1% per month in accordance with the methodology specified for unpaid balances for Transmission Provider's retail accounts specified in Departmental Policy and Procedure 500 P III-302, section 4.16.2. Interest on delinquent amounts shall be calculated from the due date of the bill to the date of payment. When payments are made by mail, bills shall be considered as having been paid on the date of receipt by the Transmission Provider.

 7.3 Customer Default:

 In the event the Transmission Customer fails, for any reason other than a billing dispute as described below, to make payment to the Transmission Provider on or before the due date as described above, and such failure of payment is not corrected within thirty (30) calendar days after the Transmission Provider notifies the Transmission Customer to cure such failure, a default by the Transmission Customer shall be deemed to exist. Upon the occurrence of a default, the Transmission Provider may terminate service. In the event of a billing dispute between the Transmission Provider and the Transmission Customer, the Transmission Provider will continue to provide service under the Service Agreement as long as the Transmission Customer (i) continues to make all payments not in dispute, and (ii) pays into an independent escrow account the portion of the invoice in dispute, pending resolution of such dispute. If the Transmission Customer fails to meet these two requirements for continuation of service, then the Transmission Provider may provide notice to the Transmission Customer of its intention to suspend service in sixty (60) days.

 8 Accounting for the Transmission Provider's Use of the Tariff

 Upon commencement of service under this tariff to a Transmission Customer, the Transmission Provider shall record the following amounts, as outlined below.

 8.1 Transmission Revenues:

 Include in a separate operating revenue account or subaccount the revenues it receives from Transmission Service when making Third-Party Sales under Part II of the Tariff.

 8.2 Study Costs and Revenues:

 Include in a separate transmission operating expense account or subaccount, costs properly chargeable to expenses that are incurred to perform any System Impact Studies or Facilities Studies which the Transmission Provider conducts to determine if it must construct new transmission facilities or upgrades necessary for its own uses, including making Third-Party Sales under the Tariff; and include in a separate operating revenue account or subaccount the revenues received for System Impact Studies or Facilities Studies performed when such amounts are separately stated and identified in the Transmission Customer's billing under the Tariff.

 9 Withdrawal Of and Changes To, The Tariff By The Transmission Provider

 Notwithstanding any other provisions in the Tariff or in a Service Agreement, the Transmission Provider shall have the right to unilaterally withdraw the Tariff at any time. Such withdrawal shall not affect existing Service Agreements for Firm Point-To-Point Transmission Service, including agreements for associated Ancillary Services procured under this Tariff which would continue to be performed under the grandfathered tariff agreement. Upon such withdrawal of the Tariff, the Transmission Provider shall provide a written termination notice to those Transmission Customers with Service Agreements for Non-Firm Point-To-Point Transmission Service. Such notice of termination shall be effective: (i) thirty (30) days from the date of receipt for those Service Agreements with a remaining term in excess of thirty (30) days, or (ii) on the last day of the current term of the Service Agreement for those Service Agreements with a remaining term of less than thirty (30) days.

 Nothing contained in the Tariff or any Service Agreement shall be construed as affecting in any way the right of the Transmission Provider to unilaterally make a change in rates, terms and conditions, charges, classification of service, and Service Agreement.

 10 Force Majeure and Indemnification

 10.1 Force Majeure:

 An event of Force Majeure means any act of God, labor disturbance, act of the public enemy, war, insurrection, riot, fire, storm or flood, explosion, breakage or accident to machinery or equipment, any Curtailment, order, regulation or restriction imposed by governmental military or lawfully established civilian authorities, or any other cause beyond a Party's control. A Force Majeure event does not include an act of negligence or intentional wrongdoing. Neither the Transmission Provider nor the Transmission Customer will be considered in default as to any obligation under this Tariff if prevented from fulfilling the obligation due to an event of Force Majeure. However, a Party whose performance under this Tariff is hindered by an event of Force Majeure shall make all reasonable efforts to perform its obligations under this Tariff.

 10.2 Indemnification:

 The Transmission Customer shall at all times indemnify, defend, and save the Transmission Provider harmless from, any and all damages, losses, claims, including claims and actions relating to injury to or death of any person or damage to property, demands, suits, recoveries, costs and expenses, court costs, attorney fees, and all other obligations by or to third parties, arising out of or resulting from the Transmission Provider's performance of its obligations under this Tariff on behalf of the Transmission Customer, except in cases of negligence or intentional wrongdoing by the Transmission Provider.

 11 Creditworthiness

 The Transmission Provider will specify its Creditworthiness procedures in Attachment L.

 12 Resolution of Disputes Other Than Those Related to Termination:

 12.1 Applicability of Section 12:

 The provisions of Section 12 shall be the exclusive basis by which to resolve all disputes arising under this Tariff except as otherwise provided in Section 12 and except for those disputes resulting from the Transmission Provider's proposed termination of service.

 12.2 Internal Dispute Resolution Procedures:

 Any dispute between a Transmission Customer and the Transmission Provider involving transmission service under the Tariff (excluding disputes involving the Transmission Provider's termination of service under Section XX and disputes regarding changes to the rates, rate methodologies, or non-rate terms and conditions in this Tariff or any Service Agreement entered into under the Tariff, but including disputes regarding the Transmission Provider's proposed charges for Direct Assignment Facilities, Network Upgrades, stranded costs, and redispatch cost) shall be referred to a designated senior representative of the Transmission Provider and a senior representative of the Transmission Customer for resolution on an informal basis as promptly as practicable. In the event the designated representatives are unable to resolve the dispute within thirty (30) days or such other period as the Parties may agree upon by mutual agreement, such dispute may be submitted to arbitration and resolved in accordance with the arbitration procedures set forth below.

 12.3 External Arbitration Procedures:

 Any arbitration initiated under this Section 12 shall be conducted before a single neutral arbitrator appointed by the Parties. If the Parties fail to agree upon a single arbitrator within ten (10) days of the referral of the dispute to arbitration, each Party shall choose one arbitrator who shall sit on a three-member arbitration panel. The two arbitrators so chosen shall within twenty (20) days select a third arbitrator to chair the arbitration panel. In either case, the arbitrators shall be knowledgeable in electric utility matters, including electric transmission and bulk power issues, and shall not have any current or past substantial business or financial relationships with any party to the arbitration (except prior arbitration). The arbitrator(s) shall provide each of the Parties an opportunity to be heard and, except as otherwise provided herein, shall generally conduct the arbitration in accordance with the Commercial Arbitration Rules of the American Arbitration Association.

 12.4 Decisionmaking Standards:

 The arbitrator(s) shall resolve disputes regarding the Transmission Provider's proposed charges for Direct Assignment Facilities, Network Upgrades, redispatch costs and stranded costs in accordance with the Commission's policy for recovery of such costs by public utilities. All disputes shall be resolved consistent with Commission Order No. 888, as may be amended.

The decision of the arbitrator(s) shall be final and binding upon the Parties, and judgment on the award may be entered in any court having jurisdiction. The decision of the arbitrator(s) may be appealed to a court of competent jurisdiction situated in the City of Seattle.

 12.6 Costs:

 Each Party shall be responsible for its own costs incurred during the arbitration process and for the following costs, if applicable:

 1. the cost of the arbitrator chosen by the Party to sit on the three member panel and one half of the cost of the third arbitrator chosen; or

 2. one half the cost of the single arbitrator jointly chosen by the Parties.

 II. POINT-TO-POINT TRANSMISSION SERVICE

 Preamble

 The Transmission Provider will provide Firm and Non-Firm Point-To-Point Transmission Service pursuant to the applicable terms and conditions of this Tariff. Point-To-Point Transmission Service is for the receipt of capacity and energy at designated Point(s) of Receipt and the transfer of such capacity and energy to designated Point(s) of Delivery.

 13 Nature of Firm Point-To-Point Transmission Service

 13.1 Term:

 The minimum term of Firm Point-To-Point Transmission Service shall be one day and the maximum term shall be specified in the Service Agreement.

 13.2 Reservation Priority:

 (i) Long-Term Firm Point-To-Point Transmission Service shall be available on a first-come, first-served basis, i.e., in the chronological sequence in which each Transmission Customer has requested service.

 (ii) Reservations for Short-Term Firm Point-To-Point Transmission Service will be conditional based upon the length of the requested transaction or reservation. However, Pre-Confirmed Applications for Short-Term Point-to- Point Transmission Service will receive priority over earlier-submitted requests that are not Pre-Confirmed and that have equal or shorter duration. Among requests or reservations with the same duration and, as relevant, pre-confirmation status (pre-Confirmed, confirmed or not confirmed), priority will be given to an Eligible Customer's request or reservation that offers the highest price, followed by the date and time of the request or reservation.

 (iii) If the Transmission System becomes oversubscribed, requests for service may preempt competing reservations up to the following conditional reservation deadlines: one day before the commencement of daily service, one week before the commencement of weekly service, and one month before the commencement of monthly service. Before the conditional reservation deadline, if available transfer capability is insufficient to satisfy all requests and reservations, an Eligible Customer with a reservation for shorter term service or equal duration service and lower price has the right of first refusal to match any longer term request or equal duration service with a higher price before losing its reservation priority. A longer term competing request for Short-Term Firm Point-To-Point Transmission Service will be granted if the Eligible Customer with the right of first refusal does not agree to match the competing request within 24 hours (or earlier if necessary to comply with the scheduling deadlines provided in section 13.8) from being notified by the Transmission Provider of a longer-term competing request for Short-Term Firm Point-To-Point Transmission Service. When a longer duration request preempts multiple shorter duration reservations, the shorter duration reservations shall have simultaneous opportunities to exercise the right of first refusal. Duration, price and time of response will be used to determine the order by which the multiple shorter duration reservations will be able to exercise the right of first refusal. After the conditional reservation deadline, service will commence pursuant to the terms of Part II of the Tariff.

 (iv) Firm Point-To-Point Transmission Service will always have a reservation priority over Non-Firm Point-To-Point Transmission Service under the Tariff. All Long-Term Firm Point-To-Point Transmission Service will have equal reservation priority with Native Load Customers and Network Customers. Reservation priorities for existing firm service customers are provided in Section 2.2.

 13.3 Use of Firm Transmission Service by the Transmission Provider:

 Upon commencement of service under this tariff to a Transmission Customer, the Transmission Provider will be subject to the rates, terms and conditions of Part II of the Tariff when making Third-Party Sales using the transmission facilities included in this tariff. The Transmission Provider will maintain separate accounting, pursuant to Section 8, for any use of the Point-To-Point Transmission Service to make Third-Party Sales.

 13.4 Service Agreements:

 The Transmission Provider shall offer a standard form Firm Point-To-Point Transmission Service Agreement (Attachment A) to an Eligible Customer when it submits a Completed Application for Long-Term Firm Point-To-Point Transmission Service. The Transmission Provider shall offer a standard form Firm Point-To-Point Transmission Service Agreement (Attachment A) to an Eligible Customer when it first submits a Completed Application for Short-Term Firm Point-To-Point Transmission Service pursuant to the Tariff. An Eligible Customer that uses Transmission Service at a Point of Receipt or Point of Delivery that it has not reserved and that has not executed a Service Agreement will be deemed, for purposes of assessing any appropriate charges and penalties, to have executed the appropriate Service Agreement. The Service Agreement shall, when applicable, specify any conditional curtailment options selected by the Transmission Customer. Where the Service Agreement contains conditional curtailment options and is subject to a biennial reassessment as described in Section 15.4, the Transmission Provider shall provide the Transmission Customer notice of any changes to the curtailment conditions no less than 90 days prior to the date for imposition of new curtailment conditions. Concurrent with such notice, the Transmission Provider shall provide the Transmission Customer with the reassessment study and a narrative description of the study, including the reasons for changes to the number of hours per year or System Conditions under which conditional curtailment may occur.

 13.5 Transmission Customer Obligations for Facility Additions or Redispatch Costs:

 In cases where the Transmission Provider determines that the Transmission System is not capable of providing Firm Point-To-Point Transmission Service without (1) degrading or impairing the reliability of service to Native Load Customers, Network Customers and other Transmission Customers taking Firm Point-To-Point Transmission Service, or (2) interfering with the Transmission Provider's ability to meet prior firm contractual commitments to others, the Transmission Provider will be obligated to expand or upgrade its Transmission System pursuant to the terms of Section 15.4. The Transmission Customer must agree to compensate the Transmission Provider for any necessary transmission facility additions pursuant to the terms of Section 27. To the extent the Transmission Provider can relieve any system constraint by redispatching the Transmission Provider's resources, it shall do so, provided that the Eligible Customer agrees to compensate the Transmission Provider pursuant to the terms of Section 27 and agrees to either (i) compensate the Transmission Provider for any necessary transmission facility additions or (ii) accept the service subject to a biennial reassessment by the Transmission Provider of redispatch requirements as described in Section 15.4. Any redispatch, Network Upgrade or Direct Assignment Facilities costs to be charged to the Transmission Customer on an incremental basis under the Tariff will be specified in the Service Agreement prior to initiating service.

 13.6 Curtailment of Firm Transmission Service:

 In the event that a Curtailment on the Transmission Provider's Transmission System, or a portion thereof, is required to maintain reliable operation of such system and the system directly and indirectly interconnected with Transmission Provider's Transmission System, Curtailments will be made on a non-discriminatory basis to the transaction(s) that effectively relieve the constraint. Transmission Provider may elect to implement such Curtailments pursuant to the Transmission Loading Relief procedures specified in Attachment J. If multiple transactions require Curtailment, to the extent practicable and consistent with Good Utility Practice, the Transmission Provider will curtail service to Network Customers and Transmission Customers taking Firm Point-To-Point Transmission Service on a basis comparable to the curtailment of service to the Transmission Provider's Native Load Customers. All Curtailments will be made on a non-discriminatory basis, however, Non-Firm Point-To-Point Transmission Service shall be subordinate to Firm Transmission Service. Long-Term Firm Point-to-Point Service subject to conditions described in Section 15.4 shall be curtailed with secondary service in cases where the conditions apply, but otherwise will be curtailed on a pro rata basis with other Firm Transmission Service. When the Transmission Provider determines that an electrical emergency exists on its Transmission System and implements emergency procedures to Curtail Firm Transmission Service, the Transmission Customer shall make the required reductions upon request of the Transmission Provider. However, the Transmission Provider reserves the right to Curtail, in whole or in part, any Firm Transmission Service provided under the Tariff when, in the Transmission Provider's sole discretion, an emergency or other unforeseen condition impairs or degrades the reliability of its Transmission System. The Transmission Provider will notify all affected Transmission Customers in a timely manner of any scheduled Curtailments.

 13.7 Classification of Firm Transmission Service:

 (a) The Transmission Customer taking Firm Point-To-Point Transmission Service may (1) change its Receipt and Delivery Points to obtain service on a non-firm basis consistent with the terms of Section 22.1 or (2) request a modification of the Points of Receipt or Delivery on a firm basis pursuant to the terms of Section 22.2.

 (b) The Transmission Customer may purchase transmission service to make sales of capacity and energy from multiple generating units that are on the Transmission Provider's Transmission System. For such a purchase of transmission service, the resources will be designated as multiple Points of Receipt, unless the multiple generating units are at the same generating plant in which case the units would be treated as a single Point of Receipt.

 (c) The Transmission Provider shall provide firm deliveries of capacity and energy from the Point(s) of Receipt to the Point(s) of Delivery. Each Point of Receipt at which firm transmission capacity is reserved by the Transmission Customer shall be set forth in the Firm Point-To-Point Service Agreement for Long-Term Firm Transmission Service along with a corresponding capacity reservation associated with each Point of Receipt. Points of Receipt and corresponding capacity reservations shall be as mutually agreed upon by the Parties for Short-Term Firm Transmission. Each Point of Delivery at which firm transfer capability is reserved by the Transmission Customer shall be set forth in the Firm Point-To-Point Service Agreement for Long-Term Firm Transmission Service along with a corresponding capacity reservation associated with each Point of Delivery. Points of Delivery and corresponding capacity reservations shall be as mutually agreed upon by the Parties for Short-Term Firm Transmission. The greater of either (1) the sum of the capacity reservations at the Point(s) of Receipt, or (2) the sum of the capacity reservations at the Point(s) of Delivery shall be the Transmission Customer's Reserved Capacity. The Transmission Customer will be billed for its Reserved Capacity under the terms of Schedule 7. The Transmission Customer may not exceed its firm capacity reserved at each Point of Receipt and each Point of Delivery except as otherwise specified in Section 22. The Transmission Provider shall specify the rate treatment and all related terms and conditions applicable in the event that a Transmission Customer (including Third- Party Sales by the Transmission Provider) exceeds its firm reserved capacity at any Point of Receipt or Point of Delivery or uses Transmission Service at a Point of Receipt or Point of Delivery that it has not reserved.

 13.8 Scheduling of Firm Point-To-Point Transmission Service:

 Schedules for the Transmission Customer's Firm Point-To-Point Transmission Service must be submitted to the Transmission Provider no later than 10:00 a.m. of the day prior to commencement of such service. Schedules submitted after 10:00 a.m. will be accommodated, if practicable. Hour-to- hour schedules of any capacity and energy that is to be delivered must be stated in increments of 1,000 kW per hour. Transmission Customers within the Transmission Provider's service area with multiple requests for Transmission Service at a Point of Receipt, each of which is under 1,000 kW per hour, may consolidate their service requests at a common point of receipt into units of 1,000 kW per hour for scheduling and billing purposes. Scheduling changes will be permitted up to twenty (20) minutes before the start of the next clock hour provided that the Delivering Party and Receiving Party also agree to the schedule modification. The Transmission Provider will furnish to the Delivering Party's system operator, hour-to-hour schedules equal to those furnished by the Receiving Party (unless reduced for losses) and shall deliver the capacity and energy provided by such schedules. Should the Transmission Customer, Delivering Party or Receiving Party revise or terminate any schedule, such party shall immediately notify the Transmission Provider, and the Transmission Provider shall have the right to adjust accordingly the schedule for capacity and energy to be received and to be delivered.

 14 Nature of Non-Firm Point-To-Point Transmission Service

 14.1 Term:

 Non-Firm Point-To-Point Transmission Service will be available for periods ranging from one (1) hour to one (1) month. However, a Purchaser of Non- Firm Point-To-Point Transmission Service will be entitled to reserve a sequential term of service (such as a sequential monthly term without having to wait for the initial term to expire before requesting another monthly term) so that the total time period for which the reservation applies is greater than one month, subject to the requirements of Section 18.3.

 14.2 Reservation Priority:

 Non-Firm Point-To-Point Transmission Service shall be available from transfer capability in excess of that needed for reliable service to Native Load Customers, Network Customers and other Transmission Customers taking Long-Term and Short-Term Firm Point-To-Point Transmission Service. A higher priority will be assigned first to requests or reservations with a longer duration of service and second to Pre-Confirmed Applications. In the event the Transmission System is constrained, competing requests of the same Pre-Confirmation status and equal duration will be prioritized based on the highest price offered by the Eligible Customer for the Transmission Service. Eligible Customers that have already reserved shorter term service have the right of first refusal to match any longer term request before being preempted. A longer term competing request for Non-Firm Point-To-Point Transmission Service will be granted if the Eligible Customer with the right of first refusal does not agree to match the competing request: (a) immediately for hourly Non-Firm Point-To-Point Transmission Service after notification by the Transmission Provider; and, (b) within 24 hours (or earlier if necessary to comply with the scheduling deadlines provided in section 14.6) for Non-Firm Point-To-Point Transmission Service other than hourly transactions after notification by the Transmission Provider. Transmission service for Network Customers from resources other than designated Network Resources will have a higher priority than any Non-Firm Point-To-Point Transmission Service. Non-Firm Point-To-Point Transmission Service over secondary Point(s) of Receipt and Point(s) of Delivery will have the lowest reservation priority under the Tariff.

 14.3 Use of Non-Firm Point-To-Point Transmission Service by the Transmission Provider:

 The Transmission Provider will be subject to the rates, terms and conditions of Part II of the Tariff when making Third-Party Sales under agreements executed on or after the date that transmission service to a Transmission Customer under this tariff commences. The Transmission Provider will maintain separate accounting, pursuant to Section 8, for any use of Non-Firm Point-To-Point Transmission Service to make Third-Party Sales.

 14.4 Service Agreements:

 The Transmission Provider shall offer a standard form Non-Firm Point-To- Point Transmission Service Agreement (Attachment B) to an Eligible Customer when it first submits a Completed Application for Non-Firm Point- To-Point Transmission Service pursuant to the Tariff.

 14.5 Classification of Non-Firm Point-To-Point Transmission Service:

 Non-Firm Point-To-Point Transmission Service shall be offered under terms and conditions contained in Part II of the Tariff. The Transmission Provider undertakes no obligation under the Tariff to plan its Transmission System in order to have sufficient capacity for Non-Firm Point-To-Point Transmission Service. Parties requesting Non-Firm Point- To-Point Transmission Service for the transmission of firm power do so with the full realization that such service is subject to availability and to Curtailment or Interruption under the terms of the Tariff. The Transmission Provider shall specify the rate treatment and all related terms and conditions applicable in the event that a Transmission Customer (including Third-Party Sales by the Transmission Provider) exceeds its non-firm capacity reservation. Non-Firm Point-To-Point Transmission Service shall include transmission of energy on an hourly basis and transmission of scheduled short-term capacity and energy on a daily, weekly or monthly basis, but not to exceed one month's reservation for any one Application, under Schedule 8.

 14.6 Scheduling of Non-Firm Point-To-Point Transmission Service:

 Schedules for Non-Firm Point-To-Point Transmission Service must be submitted to the Transmission Provider no later than 2:00 p.m. of the day prior to commencement of such service. Schedules submitted after 2:00 p.m. will be accommodated, if practicable. Hour-to-hour schedules of energy that is to be delivered must be stated in increments of 1,000 kW per hour. Transmission Customers within the Transmission Provider's service area with multiple requests for Transmission Service at a Point of Receipt, each of which is under 1,000 kW per hour, may consolidate their schedules at a common Point of Receipt into units of 1,000 kW per hour. Scheduling changes will be permitted up to twenty (20) minutes before the start of the next clock hour provided that the Delivering Party and Receiving Party also agree to the schedule modification. The Transmission Provider will furnish to the Delivering Party's system operator, hour-to- hour schedules equal to those furnished by the Receiving Party (unless reduced for losses) and shall deliver the capacity and energy provided by such schedules. Should the Transmission Customer, Delivering Party or Receiving Party revise or terminate any schedule, such party shall immediately notify the Transmission Provider, and the Transmission Provider shall have the right to adjust accordingly the schedule for capacity and energy to be received and to be delivered.

 14.7 Curtailment or Interruption of Service:

 The Transmission Provider reserves the right to Curtail, in whole or in part, Non-Firm Point-To-Point Transmission Service provided under the Tariff for reliability reasons when an emergency or other unforeseen condition threatens to impair or degrade the reliability of its Transmission System or the systems directly and indirectly interconnected with Transmission Provider's Transmission System. Transmission Provider may elect to implement such Curtailments pursuant to the Transmission Loading Relief procedures specified in Attachment J. The Transmission Provider reserves the right to Interrupt, in whole or in part, Non-Firm Point-To-Point Transmission Service provided under the Tariff for economic reasons in order to accommodate (1) a request for Firm Transmission Service, (2) a request for Non-Firm Point-To-Point Transmission Service of greater duration, (3) a request for Non-Firm Point-To-Point Transmission Service of equal duration with a higher price, (4) transmission service for Network Customers from non-designated resources, or (5) transmission service for Firm Point-to-Point Transmission Service during conditional curtailment periods as described in Section 15.4. The Transmission Provider also will discontinue or reduce service to the Transmission Customer to the extent that deliveries for transmission are discontinued or reduced at the Point(s) of Receipt. Where required, Curtailments or Interruptions will be made on a non-discriminatory basis to the transaction(s) that effectively relieve the constraint, however, Non-Firm Point-To-Point Transmission Service shall be subordinate to Firm Transmission Service. If multiple transactions require Curtailment or Interruption, to the extent practicable and consistent with Good Utility Practice, Curtailments or Interruptions will be made to transactions of the shortest term (e.g., hourly non-firm transactions will be Curtailed or Interrupted before daily non-firm transactions and daily non-firm transactions will be Curtailed or Interrupted before weekly non-firm transactions). Transmission service for Network Customers from resources other than designated Network Resources will have a higher priority than any Non-Firm Point-To-Point Transmission Service under the Tariff. Non- Firm Point-To-Point Transmission Service over secondary Point(s) of Receipt and Point(s) of Delivery will have a lower priority than any Non- Firm Point-To-Point Transmission Service under the Tariff. The Transmission Provider will provide advance notice of Curtailment or Interruption where such notice can be provided consistent with Good Utility Practice.

 15 Service Availability

 15.1 General Conditions:

 The Transmission Provider will provide Firm and Non-Firm Point-To-Point Transmission Service over, on or across its Transmission System to any Transmission Customer that has met the requirements of Section 16.

 15.2 Determination of Available Transfer Capability:

 A description of the Transmission Provider's specific methodology for assessing available transfer capability is contained in Attachment C of the Tariff. In the event sufficient transfer capability may not exist to accommodate a service request, the Transmission Provider will respond by performing a System Impact Study.

 15.3 Initiating Service in the Absence of an Executed Service Agreement:

 If the Transmission Provider and the Transmission Customer requesting Firm or Non-Firm Point-To-Point Transmission Service cannot agree on all the terms and conditions of the Point-To-Point Service Agreement, the Transmission Customer and Transmission Provider shall initiate dispute resolution processes in accordance with Section 12 of this tariff.

 15.4 Obligation to Provide Transmission Service that Requires Expansion or Modification of the Transmission System, Redispatch or Conditional Curtailment:

 (a) If the Transmission Provider determines that it cannot accommodate a Completed Application for Firm Point-To-Point Transmission Service because of insufficient capability on its Transmission System, the Transmission Provider will use due diligence to expand or modify its Transmission System to provide the requested Firm Transmission Service, consistent with its planning obligations in Attachment K, provided the Transmission Customer agrees to compensate the Transmission Provider for such costs pursuant to the terms of Section 27. The Transmission Provider will conform to Good Utility Practice and its planning obligations in Attachment K, in determining the need for new facilities and in the design and construction of such facilities. The obligation applies only to those facilities that the Transmission Provider has the right to expand or modify.

 (b) If the Transmission Provider determines that it cannot accommodate a Completed Application for Long-Term Firm Point-To-Point Transmission Service because of insufficient capability on its Transmission System, the Transmission Provider will use due diligence to provide redispatch from its own resources until (i) Network Upgrades are completed for the Transmission Customer, (ii) the Transmission Provider determines through a biennial reassessment that it can no longer reliably provide the redispatch, or (iii) the Transmission Customer terminates the service because of redispatch changes resulting from the reassessment. A Transmission Provider shall not unreasonably deny self-provided redispatch or redispatch arranged by the Transmission Customer from a third party resource.

 (c) If the Transmission Provider determines that it cannot accommodate a Completed Application for Long-Term Firm Point-To-Point Transmission Service because of insufficient capability on its Transmission System, the Transmission Provider will offer the Firm Transmission Service with the condition that the Transmission Provider may curtail the service prior to the curtailment of other Firm Transmission Service for a specified number of hours per year or during System Condition(s). If the Transmission Customer accepts the service, the Transmission Provider will use due diligence to provide the service until (i) Network Upgrades are completed for the Transmission Customer, (ii) the Transmission Provider determines through a biennial reassessment that it can no longer reliably provide such service, or (iii) the Transmission Customer terminates the service because the reassessment increased the number of hours per year of conditional curtailment or changed the System Conditions.

 15.5 Deferral of Service:

 The Transmission Provider may defer providing service until it completes construction of new transmission facilities or upgrades needed to provide Firm Point-To-Point Transmission Service whenever the Transmission Provider determines that providing the requested service would, without such new facilities or upgrades, impair or degrade reliability to any existing firm services.

 15.6 Other Transmission Service Schedules:

 Eligible Customers receiving transmission service under other agreements with the Transmission Provider may continue to receive transmission service under those agreements until such time as those agreements may be modified by Seattle City Light.

 15.7 Real Power Losses:

 Real Power Losses are associated with all transmission service. The Transmission Provider is not obligated to provide Real Power Losses. The Transmission Customer is responsible for replacing losses associated with all transmission service as calculated by the Transmission Provider pursuant to a System Impact Study.

 16 Transmission Customer Responsibilities

 17.3 Deposit:

 A Completed Application for Firm Point-To-Point Transmission Service also shall include a deposit of either one month's charge for Reserved Capacity or the full charge for Reserved Capacity for service requests of less than one month. If the Application is rejected by the Transmission Provider because it does not meet the conditions for service as set forth herein, or in the case of requests for service arising in connection with losing bidders in a Request For Proposals (RFP), said deposit shall be returned with interest less any reasonable costs incurred by the Transmission Provider in connection with the review of the losing bidder's Application. The deposit also will be returned with interest less any reasonable costs incurred by the Transmission Provider if the Transmission Provider is unable to complete new facilities needed to provide the service. If an Application is withdrawn or the Eligible Customer decides not to enter into a Service Agreement for Firm Point-To-Point Transmission Service, the deposit shall be refunded in full, with interest, less reasonable costs incurred by the Transmission Provider to the extent such costs have not already been recovered by the Transmission Provider from the Eligible Customer. The Transmission Provider will provide to the Eligible Customer a complete accounting of all costs deducted from the refunded deposit, which the Eligible Customer may contest if there is a dispute concerning the deducted costs. Deposits associated with construction of new facilities are subject to the provisions of Section 19. If a Service Agreement for Firm Point-To-Point Transmission Service is executed, the deposit, with interest, will be returned to the Transmission Customer upon expiration or termination of the Service Agreement for Firm Point-To-Point Transmission Service. Applicable interest shall be calculated in accordance with the methodology specified for interest on deposits in the electric service connection provisions in the Seattle Municipal Code, 21.49.110.X. The interest rate is earned at the rate of interest on the City's cash pool for the period during which the balance was held. Interest shall be calculated from the day the deposit check is credited to the Transmission Provider's account.

 17.4 Notice of Deficient Application:

 If an Application fails to meet the requirements of the Tariff, the Transmission Provider shall notify the entity requesting service within fifteen (15) days of receipt of the reasons for such failure. The Transmission Provider will attempt to remedy minor deficiencies in the Application through informal communications with the Eligible Customer. If such efforts are unsuccessful, the Transmission Provider shall return the Application, along with any deposit, with interest. Upon receipt of a new or revised Application that fully complies with the requirements of Part II of the Tariff, the Eligible Customer shall be assigned a new priority consistent with the date of the new or revised Application.

 17.5 Response to a Completed Application:

 Following receipt of a Completed Application for Firm Point-To-Point Transmission Service, the Transmission Provider shall make a determination of available transfer capability as required in Section 15.2. The Transmission Provider shall notify the Eligible Customer as soon as practicable, but not later than thirty (30) days after the date of receipt of a Completed Application either (i) if it will be able to provide service without performing a System Impact Study or (ii) if such a study is needed to evaluate the impact of the Application pursuant to Section 19.1. Responses by the Transmission Provider must be made as soon as practicable to all completed applications (including applications by its own merchant function) and the timing of such responses must be made on a non-discriminatory basis.

 17.6 Execution of Service Agreement:

 Whenever the Transmission Provider determines that a System Impact Study is not required and that the service can be provided, it shall notify the Eligible Customer as soon as practicable but no later than thirty (30) days after receipt of the Completed Application. Where a System Impact Study is required, the provisions of Section 19 will govern the execution of a Service Agreement. Failure of an Eligible Customer to execute and return the Service Agreement or request the filing of an unexecuted service agreement pursuant to Section 15.3, within fifteen (15) days after it is tendered by the Transmission Provider will be deemed a withdrawal and termination of the Application and any deposit submitted shall be refunded with interest. Nothing herein limits the right of an Eligible Customer to file another Application after such withdrawal and termination.

 17.7 Extensions for Commencement of Service:

 The Transmission Customer can obtain, subject to availability, up to five (5) one-year extensions for the commencement of service. The Transmission Customer may postpone service by paying a non-refundable annual reservation fee equal to one-month's charge for Firm Transmission Service for each year or fraction thereof within 15 days of notifying the Transmission Provider it intends to extend the commencement of service. If during any extension for the commencement of service an Eligible Customer submits a Completed Application for Firm Transmission Service, and such request can be satisfied only by releasing all or part of the Transmission Customer's Reserved Capacity, the original Reserved Capacity will be released unless the following condition is satisfied. Within thirty (30) days, the original Transmission Customer agrees to pay the Firm Point-To-Point transmission rate for its Reserved Capacity concurrent with the new Service Commencement Date. In the event the Transmission Customer elects to release the Reserved Capacity, the reservation fees or portions thereof previously paid will be forfeited.

 18 Procedures for Arranging Non-Firm Point-To-Point Transmission Service

 18.1 Application:

 Eligible Customers seeking Non-Firm Point-To-Point Transmission Service must submit a Completed Application to the Transmission Provider. Applications should be submitted by entering the information listed below on the Transmission Provider's OASIS. Prior to implementation of the Transmission Provider's OASIS, a Completed Application may be submitted by transmitting the required information to the Transmission Provider by email to oatt@seattle.gov. Each of these methods will provide a time- stamped record for establishing the service priority of the Application.

 18.2 Completed Application:

 In addition to the information specified above, when required to properly evaluate system conditions, the Transmission Provider also may ask the Transmission Customer to provide the following:

 (vi) The electrical location of the initial source of the power to be transmitted pursuant to the Transmission Customer's request for service; and

 (vii) The electrical location of the ultimate load.

 The Transmission Provider will treat this information in (vi) and (vii) as confidential at the request of the Transmission Customer except to the extent that disclosure of this information is required by this Tariff, by law or regulatory or judicial order, for reliability purposes pursuant to Good Utility Practice, or pursuant to RTG transmission information sharing agreements. The Transmission Provider shall treat this information consistent with the standards of conduct contained in Part 37 of the Commission's regulations as may be adopted by Seattle City Light.

 (viii) A statement indicating that, if the Eligible Customer submits a Pre-Confirmed Application, the Eligible Customer will execute a Service Agreement upon receipt of notification that the Transmission Provider can provide the requested Transmission Service.

 18.3 Reservation of Non-Firm Point-To-Point Transmission Service:

 Requests for monthly service shall be submitted no earlier than sixty (60) days before service is to commence; requests for weekly service shall be submitted no earlier than fourteen (14) days before service is to commence, requests for daily service shall be submitted no earlier than two (2) days before service is to commence, and requests for hourly service shall be submitted no earlier than noon the day before service is to commence. Requests for service received later than 2:00 p.m. prior to the day service is scheduled to commence will be accommodated if practicable.

 18.4 Determination of Available Transfer Capability:

 Following receipt of a tendered schedule the Transmission Provider will make a determination on a non-discriminatory basis of available transfer capability pursuant to Section 15.2. Such determination shall be made as soon as reasonably practicable after receipt, but not later than the following time periods for the following terms of service (i) thirty (30) minutes for hourly service, (ii) thirty (30) minutes for daily service, (iii) four (4) hours for weekly service, and (iv) two (2) days for monthly service.

 19 Additional Study Procedures For Firm Point-To-Point Transmission Service Requests

 19.1 Notice of Need for System Impact Study:

 After receiving a request for service, the Transmission Provider shall determine on a non-discriminatory basis whether a System Impact Study is needed. A description of the Transmission Provider's methodology for completing a System Impact Study is provided in Attachment D. If the Transmission Provider determines that a System Impact Study is necessary to accommodate the requested service, it shall so inform the Eligible Customer, as soon as practicable. Once informed, the Eligible Customer shall timely notify the Transmission Provider if it elects to have the Transmission Provider study redispatch or conditional curtailment as part of the System Impact Study. If notification is provided prior to tender of the System Impact Study Agreement, the Eligible Customer can avoid the costs associated with the study of these options. The Transmission Provider shall within thirty (30) days of receipt of a Completed Application, tender a System Impact Study Agreement pursuant to which the Eligible Customer shall agree to reimburse the Transmission Provider for performing the required System Impact Study. For a service request to remain a Completed Application, the Eligible Customer shall execute the System Impact Study Agreement and return it to the Transmission Provider within fifteen (15) days. If the Eligible Customer elects not to execute the System Impact Study Agreement, its application shall be deemed withdrawn and its deposit, pursuant to Section 17.3, shall be returned with interest.

 19.2 System Impact Study Agreement and Cost Reimbursement:

 (i) The System Impact Study Agreement will clearly specify the Transmission Provider's estimate of the actual cost, and time for completion of the System Impact Study. The charge shall not exceed the actual cost of the study. In performing the System Impact Study, the Transmission Provider shall rely, to the extent reasonably practicable, on existing transmission planning studies. The Eligible Customer will not be assessed a charge for such existing studies; however, the Eligible Customer will be responsible for charges associated with any modifications to existing planning studies that are reasonably necessary to evaluate the impact of the Eligible Customer's request for service on the Transmission System.

 (ii) If in response to multiple Eligible Customers requesting service in relation to the same competitive solicitation, a single System Impact Study is sufficient for the Transmission Provider to accommodate the requests for service, the costs of that study shall be pro-rated among the Eligible Customers.

 (iii) For System Impact Studies that the Transmission Provider conducts on its own behalf, the Transmission Provider shall record the cost of the System Impact Studies pursuant to Section 20.

 19.3 System Impact Study Procedures:

 Upon receipt of an executed System Impact Study Agreement, the Transmission Provider will use due diligence to complete the required System Impact Study within a sixty (60) day period. The System Impact Study shall identify (1) any system constraints, identified with specificity by transmission element or flowgate, (2) redispatch options (when requested by an Eligible Customer) including an estimate of the cost of redispatch, (3) conditional curtailment options (when requested by an Eligible Customer) including the number of hours per year and the System Conditions during which conditional curtailment may occur, and (4) additional Direct Assignment Facilities or Network Upgrades required to provide the requested service. For customers requesting the study of redispatch options, the System Impact Study shall (1) identify all resources located within the Transmission Provider's Control Area that can significantly contribute toward relieving the system constraint and (2)  provide a measurement of each resource's impact on the system constraint. If the Transmission Provider possesses information indicating that any resource outside its Control Area could relieve the constraint, it shall identify each such resource in the System Impact Study. In the event that the Transmission Provider is unable to complete the required System Impact Study within such time period, it shall so notify the Eligible Customer and provide an estimated completion date along with an explanation of the reasons why additional time is required to complete the required studies. A copy of the completed System Impact Study and related work papers shall be made available to the Eligible Customer as soon as the System Impact Study is complete. The Transmission Provider will use the same due diligence in completing the System Impact Study for an Eligible Customer as it uses when completing studies for itself. The Transmission Provider shall notify the Eligible Customer immediately upon completion of the System Impact Study if the Transmission System will be adequate to accommodate all or part of a request for service or that no costs are likely to be incurred for new transmission facilities or upgrades. In order for a request to remain a Completed Application, within fifteen (15) days of completion of the System Impact Study the Eligible Customer must execute a Service Agreement or request the filing of an unexecuted Service Agreement pursuant to Section 15.3, or the Application shall be deemed terminated and withdrawn.

 19.4 Facilities Study Procedures:

 If a System Impact Study indicates that additions or upgrades to the Transmission System are needed to supply the Eligible Customer's service request, the Transmission Provider, within thirty (30) days of the completion of the System Impact Study, shall tender to the Eligible Customer a Facilities Study Agreement pursuant to which the Eligible Customer shall agree to reimburse the Transmission Provider for performing the required Facilities Study. For a service request to remain a Completed Application, the Eligible Customer shall execute the Facilities Study Agreement and return it to the Transmission Provider within fifteen (15) days. If the Eligible Customer elects not to execute the Facilities Study Agreement, its application shall be deemed withdrawn and its deposit, pursuant to Section 17.3, shall be returned with interest. Upon receipt of an executed Facilities Study Agreement, the Transmission Provider will use due diligence to complete the required Facilities Study within a sixty (60) day period. If the Transmission Provider is unable to complete the Facilities Study in the allotted time period, the Transmission Provider shall notify the Transmission Customer and provide an estimate of the time needed to reach a final determination along with an explanation of the reasons that additional time is required to complete the study. When completed, the Facilities Study will include a good faith estimate of (i) the cost of Direct Assignment Facilities to be charged to the Transmission Customer, (ii) the Transmission Customer's appropriate share of the cost of any required Network Upgrades as determined pursuant to the provisions of Part II of the Tariff, and (iii) the time required to complete such construction and initiate the requested service. The Transmission Customer shall provide the Transmission Provider with a letter of credit or other reasonable form of security acceptable to the Transmission Provider equivalent to the costs of new facilities or upgrades consistent with commercial practices as established by the Uniform Commercial Code. The Transmission Customer shall have thirty (30) days to execute a Service Agreement or request the filing of an unexecuted Service Agreement and provide the required letter of credit or other form of security or the request will no longer be a Completed Application and shall be deemed terminated and withdrawn.

 19.5 Facilities Study Modifications:

 Any change in design arising from inability to site or construct facilities as proposed will require development of a revised good faith estimate. New good faith estimates also will be required in the event of new statutory or regulatory requirements that are effective before the completion of construction or other circumstances beyond the control of the Transmission Provider that significantly affect the final cost of new facilities or upgrades to be charged to the Transmission Customer pursuant to the provisions of Part II of the Tariff.

 19.6 Due Diligence in Completing New Facilities:

 The Transmission Provider shall use due diligence to add necessary facilities or upgrade its Transmission System within a reasonable time. The Transmission Provider will not upgrade its existing or planned Transmission System in order to provide the requested Firm Point-To-Point Transmission Service if doing so would impair system reliability or otherwise impair or degrade existing firm service.

 19.7 Partial Interim Service:

 If the Transmission Provider determines that it will not have adequate transfer capability to satisfy the full amount of a Completed Application for Firm Point-To-Point Transmission Service, the Transmission Provider nonetheless shall be obligated to offer and provide the portion of the requested Firm Point-To-Point Transmission Service that can be accommodated without addition of any facilities and through redispatch. However, the Transmission Provider shall not be obligated to provide the incremental amount of requested Firm Point-To-Point Transmission Service that requires the addition of facilities or upgrades to the Transmission System until such facilities or upgrades have been placed in service.

 19.8 Expedited Procedures for New Facilities:

 In lieu of the procedures set forth above, the Eligible Customer shall have the option to expedite the process by requesting the Transmission Provider to tender at one time, together with the results of required studies, an "Expedited Service Agreement" pursuant to which the Eligible Customer would agree to compensate the Transmission Provider for all costs incurred pursuant to the terms of the Tariff. In order to exercise this option, the Eligible Customer shall request in writing an expedited Service Agreement covering all of the above-specified items within thirty (30) days of receiving the results of the System Impact Study identifying needed facility additions or upgrades or costs incurred in providing the requested service. While the Transmission Provider agrees to provide the Eligible Customer with its best estimate of the new facility costs and other charges that may be incurred, such estimate shall not be binding and the Eligible Customer must agree in writing to compensate the Transmission Provider for all costs incurred pursuant to the provisions of the Tariff. The Eligible Customer shall execute and return such an Expedited Service Agreement within fifteen (15) days of its receipt or the Eligible Customer's request for service will cease to be a Completed Application and will be deemed terminated and withdrawn.

 20 Procedures if The Transmission Provider is Unable to Complete New Transmission Facilities for Firm Point-To-Point Transmission Service

 20.1 Delays in Construction of New Facilities:

 If any event occurs that will materially affect the time for completion of new facilities, or the ability to complete them, the Transmission Provider shall promptly notify the Transmission Customer. In such circumstances, the Transmission Provider shall within thirty (30) days of notifying the Transmission Customer of such delays, convene a technical meeting with the Transmission Customer to evaluate the alternatives available to the Transmission Customer. The Transmission Provider also shall make available to the Transmission Customer studies and work papers related to the delay, including all information that is in the possession of the Transmission Provider that is reasonably needed by the Transmission Customer to evaluate any alternatives.

 20.2 Alternatives to the Original Facility Additions:

 When the review process of Section 20.1 determines that one or more alternatives exist to the originally planned construction project, the Transmission Provider shall present such alternatives for consideration by the Transmission Customer. If, upon review of any alternatives, the Transmission Customer desires to maintain its Completed Application subject to construction of the alternative facilities, it may request the Transmission Provider to submit a revised Service Agreement for Firm Point-To-Point Transmission Service. If the alternative approach solely involves Non-Firm Point-To-Point Transmission Service, the Transmission Provider shall promptly tender a Service Agreement for Non-Firm Point-To- Point Transmission Service providing for the service. In the event the Transmission Provider concludes that no reasonable alternative exists and the Transmission Customer disagrees, the Transmission Customer may seek relief under the dispute resolution procedures pursuant to Section 12.

 20.3 Refund Obligation for Unfinished Facility Additions:

 If the Transmission Provider and the Transmission Customer mutually agree that no other reasonable alternatives exist and the requested service cannot be provided out of existing capability under the conditions of Part II of the Tariff, the obligation to provide the requested Firm Point-To- Point Transmission Service shall terminate and any deposit made by the Transmission Customer shall be returned with interest. Applicable interest shall be calculated in accordance with the methodology specified for interest on deposits in the electric service connection provisions in the Seattle Municipal Code, 21.49.110.X. The interest rate is earned at the rate of interest on the City's cash pool for the period during which the balance was held. Interest shall be calculated from the day the deposit check is credited to the Transmission Provider's account. However, the Transmission Customer shall be responsible for all prudently incurred costs by the Transmission Provider through the time construction was suspended.

 21 Provisions Relating to Transmission Construction and Services on the Systems of Other Utilities

 21.1 Responsibility for Third-Party System Additions:

 The Transmission Provider shall not be responsible for making arrangements for any necessary engineering, permitting, and construction of transmission or distribution facilities on the system(s) of any other entity or for obtaining any regulatory approval for such facilities. The Transmission Provider will undertake reasonable efforts to assist the Transmission Customer in obtaining such arrangements, including without limitation, providing any information or data required by such other electric system pursuant to Good Utility Practice.

 21.2 Coordination of Third-Party System Additions:

 In circumstances where the need for transmission facilities or upgrades is identified pursuant to the provisions of Part II of the Tariff, and if such upgrades further require the addition of transmission facilities on other systems, the Transmission Provider shall have the right to coordinate construction on its own system with the construction required by others. The Transmission Provider, after consultation with the Transmission Customer and representatives of such other systems, may defer construction of its new transmission facilities, if the new transmission facilities on another system cannot be completed in a timely manner. The Transmission Provider shall notify the Transmission Customer in writing of the basis for any decision to defer construction and the specific problems which must be resolved before it will initiate or resume construction of new facilities. Within sixty (60) days of receiving written notification by the Transmission Provider of its intent to defer construction pursuant to this section, the Transmission Customer may challenge the decision in accordance with the dispute resolution procedures pursuant to Section 12 or it may refer the dispute to the Commission for resolution.

 22 Changes in Service Specifications

 22.1 Modifications On a Non-Firm Basis:

 The Transmission Customer taking Firm Point-To-Point Transmission Service may request the Transmission Provider to provide transmission service on a non-firm basis over Receipt and Delivery Points other than those specified in the Service Agreement ("Secondary Receipt and Delivery Points"), in amounts not to exceed its firm capacity reservation, without incurring an additional Non-Firm Point-To-Point Transmission Service charge or executing a new Service Agreement, subject to the following conditions.

 (a) Service provided over Secondary Receipt and Delivery Points will be non-firm only, on an as-available basis and will not displace any firm or non-firm service reserved or scheduled by third-parties under the Tariff or by the Transmission Provider on behalf of its Native Load Customers.

 (b) The sum of all Firm and non-firm Point-To-Point Transmission Service provided to the Transmission Customer at any time pursuant to this section shall not exceed the Reserved Capacity in the relevant Service Agreement under which such services are provided.

 (c) The Transmission Customer shall retain its right to schedule Firm Point-To-Point Transmission Service at the Receipt and Delivery Points specified in the relevant Service Agreement in the amount of its original capacity reservation.

 (d) Service over Secondary Receipt and Delivery Points on a non-firm basis shall not require the filing of an Application for Non-Firm Point-To-Point Transmission Service under the Tariff. However, all other requirements of Part II of the Tariff (except as to transmission rates) shall apply to transmission service on a non-firm basis over Secondary Receipt and Delivery Points.

 22.2 Modification On a Firm Basis:

 Any request by a Transmission Customer to modify Receipt and Delivery Points on a firm basis shall be treated as a new request for service in accordance with Section 17 hereof, except that such Transmission Customer shall not be obligated to pay any additional deposit if the capacity reservation does not exceed the amount reserved in the existing Service Agreement. While such new request is pending, the Transmission Customer shall retain its priority for service at the existing firm Receipt and Delivery Points specified in its Service Agreement.

 23 Sale or Assignment of Transmission Service

 23.1 Procedures for Assignment or Transfer of Service:

 Subject to Transmission Provider approval, which shall not be unreasonably withheld, a Transmission Customer may sell, assign, or transfer all or a portion of its rights under its Service Agreement, but only to another Eligible Customer (the Assignee). The Transmission Customer that sells, assigns or transfers its rights under its Service Agreement is hereafter referred to as the Reseller. Compensation to Resellers shall not exceed the higher of (i) the original rate paid by the Reseller, (ii) the Transmission Provider's maximum rate on file at the time of the assignment, or (iii) the Reseller's opportunity cost capped at the Transmission Provider's cost of expansion; provided that, for service prior to October 1, 2010, compensation to Resellers shall be at rates established by agreement between the Reseller and the Assignee. The Assignee must execute a service agreement with the Transmission Provider governing reassignments of transmission service prior to the date on which the reassigned service commences. The Assignee must execute a service agreement with the Transmission Provider prior to the date on which the reassigned service commences that will govern the provision of reassigned service. If the Assignee does not request any change in the Point(s) of Receipt or the Point(s) of Delivery, or a change in any other term or condition set forth in the original Service Agreement, the Assignee will receive the same services as did the Reseller and the priority of service for the Assignee will be the same as that of the Reseller.

 III.

 NETWORK INTEGRATION TRANSMISSION SERVICE

 Preamble

 The Transmission Provider will provide Network Integration Transmission Service pursuant to the applicable terms and conditions contained in the Tariff and Service Agreement. Network Integration Transmission Service allows the Network Customer to integrate, economically dispatch and regulate its current and planned Network Resources to serve its Network Load in a manner comparable to that in which the Transmission Provider utilizes its Transmission System to serve its Native Load Customers. Network Integration Transmission Service also may be used by the Network Customer to deliver economy energy purchases to its Network Load from non- designated resources on an as-available basis without additional charge. Transmission service for sales to non-designated loads will be provided pursuant to the applicable terms and conditions of Part II of the Tariff.

 27 Nature of Network Integration Transmission Service

 27.1 Scope of Service:

 Network Integration Transmission Service is a transmission service that allows Network Customers to efficiently and economically utilize their Network Resources (as well as other non-designated generation resources) to serve their Network Load located in the Transmission Provider's Control Area and any additional load that may be designated pursuant to Section 31.3 of the Tariff. The Network Customer taking Network Integration Transmission Service must obtain or provide Ancillary Services pursuant to Section 3.

 27.2 Transmission Provider Responsibilities:

 The Transmission Provider will plan, construct, operate and maintain its Transmission System in accordance with Good Utility Practice and its planning obligations in Attachment K in order to provide the Network Customer with Network Integration Transmission Service over the Transmission Provider's Transmission System. Following the first Service Commencement Date of a Network Customer under this tariff, the Transmission Provider, on behalf of its Native Load Customers, shall be required to designate resources and loads in the same manner as any Network Customer under Part III of this Tariff. This information must be consistent with the information used by the Transmission Provider to calculate available transfer capability. The Transmission Provider shall include the Network Customer's Network Load in its Transmission System planning and shall, consistent with Good Utility Practice and Attachment K, endeavor to construct and place into service sufficient transfer capability to deliver the Network Customer's Network Resources to serve its Network Load on a basis comparable to the Transmission Provider's delivery of its own generating and purchased resources to its Native Load Customers.

 27.3 Network Integration Transmission Service:

 The Transmission Provider will provide firm transmission service over its Transmission System to the Network Customer for the delivery of capacity and energy from its designated Network Resources to service its Network Loads on a basis that is comparable to the Transmission Provider's use of the Transmission System to reliably serve its Native Load Customers.

 27.4 Secondary Service:

 The Network Customer may use the Transmission Provider's Transmission System to deliver energy to its Network Loads from resources that have not been designated as Network Resources. Such energy shall be transmitted, on an as-available basis, at no additional charge. Secondary service shall not require the filing of an Application for Network Integration Transmission Service under the Tariff. However, all other requirements of Part III of the Tariff (except for transmission rates) shall apply to secondary service. Deliveries from resources other than Network Resources will have a higher priority than any Non-Firm Point-To-Point Transmission Service under Part II of the Tariff.

 27.5 Real Power Losses:

 Real Power Losses are associated with all transmission service. The Transmission Provider is not obligated to provide Real Power Losses. The Network Customer is responsible for replacing losses associated with all transmission service as calculated by the Transmission Provider pursuant to a System Impact Study.

 27.6 Restrictions on Use of Service:

 The Network Customer shall not use Network Integration Transmission Service for (i) sales of capacity and energy to non-designated loads, or (ii) direct or indirect provision of transmission service by the Network Customer to third parties. All Network Customers taking Network Integration Transmission Service shall use Point-To-Point Transmission Service under Part II of the Tariff for any Third-Party Sale which requires use of the Transmission Provider's Transmission System. The Transmission Provider shall specify any appropriate charges and penalties and all related terms and conditions applicable in the event that a Network Customer uses Network Integration Transmission Service or secondary service pursuant to Section 28.4 to facilitate a wholesale sale that does not serve a Network Load.

 28.4 Network Customer Facilities:

 The provision of Network Integration Transmission Service shall be conditioned upon the Network Customer's constructing, maintaining and operating the facilities on its side of each delivery point or interconnection necessary to reliably deliver capacity and energy from the Transmission Provider's Transmission System to the Network Customer. The Network Customer shall be solely responsible for constructing or installing all facilities on the Network Customer's side of each such delivery point or interconnection.

 29 Network Resources

 29.1 Designation of Network Resources:

 Network Resources shall include all generation owned, purchased or leased by the Network Customer designated to serve Network Load under the Tariff. Network Resources may not include resources, or any portion thereof, that are committed for sale to non-designated third party load or otherwise cannot be called upon to meet the Network Customer's Network Load on a non-interruptible basis. Any owned or purchased resources that were serving the Network Customer's loads under firm agreements entered into on or before the Service Commencement Date shall initially be designated as Network Resources until the Network Customer terminates the designation of such resources.

 29.2 Designation of New Network Resources:

 The Network Customer may designate a new Network Resource by providing the Transmission Provider with as much advance notice as practicable. A designation of a new Network Resource must be made by registered mail, email or through the Transmission Provider's OASIS by a request for modification of service pursuant to an Application under Section 29. This request must include a statement that the new network resource satisfies the following conditions: (1) the Network Customer owns the resource, has committed to purchase generation pursuant to an executed contract, or has committed to purchase generation where execution of a contract is contingent upon the availability of transmission service under Part III of the Tariff; and (2) The Network Resources do not include any resources, or any portion thereof, that are committed for sale to non-designated third party load or otherwise cannot be called upon to meet the Network Customer's Network Load on a non-interruptible basis. The Network Customer's request will be deemed deficient if it does not include this statement and the Transmission Provider will follow the procedures for a deficient application as described in Section 29.2 of the Tariff.

 29.3 Termination of Network Resources:

 The Network Customer may terminate the designation of all or part of a generating resource as a Network Resource by providing notification to the Transmission Provider by registered mail, email or through OASIS as soon as reasonably practicable, but not later than the firm scheduling deadline for the period of termination. Any request for termination of Network Resource status must indicate whether the request is for indefinite or temporary termination. A request for indefinite termination of Network Resource status must indicate the date and time that the termination is to be effective, and the identification and capacity of the resource(s) or portions thereof to be indefinitely terminated. A request for temporary termination of Network Resource status must include the following:

 (i) Effective date and time of temporary termination;

 (ii) Effective date and time of redesignation, following period of temporary termination;

 (iii) Identification and capacity of resource(s) or portions thereof to be temporarily terminated;

 (iv) Resource description and attestation for redesignating the network resource following the temporary termination, in accordance with Section 30.2; and

 (v) Identification of any related transmission service requests to be evaluated concomitantly with the request for temporary termination, such that the requests for undesignation and the request for these related transmission service requests must be approved or denied as a single request. The evaluation of these related transmission service requests must take into account the termination of the network resources identified in (iii) above, as well as all competing transmission service requests of higher priority.

 As part of a temporary termination, a Network Customer may only redesignate the same resource that was originally designated, or a portion thereof. Requests to redesignate a different resource and/or a resource with increased capacity will be deemed deficient and the Transmission Provider will follow the procedures for a deficient application as described in Section 29.2 of the Tariff.

 29.4 Operation of Network Resources:

 The Network Customer shall not operate its designated Network Resources located in the Network Customer's or Transmission Provider's Control Area such that the output of those facilities exceeds its designated Network Load, plus Non-Firm Sales delivered pursuant to Part II of the Tariff, plus losses, plus power sales under a Commission-approved reserve sharing program. This limitation shall not apply to changes in the operation of a Transmission Customer's Network Resources at the request of the Transmission Provider to respond to an emergency or other unforeseen condition which may impair or degrade the reliability of the Transmission System. For all Network Resources not physically connected with the Transmission Provider's Transmission System, the Network Customer may not schedule delivery of energy in excess of the Network Resource's capacity, as specified in the Network Customer's Application pursuant to Section 29, unless the Network Customer supports such delivery within the Transmission Provider's Transmission System by either obtaining Point-to-Point Transmission Service or utilizing secondary service pursuant to Section 28.4. The Transmission Provider shall specify the rate treatment and all related terms and conditions applicable in the event that a Network Customer's schedule at the delivery point for a Network Resource not physically interconnected with the Transmission Provider's Transmission System exceeds the Network Resource's designated capacity, excluding energy delivered using secondary service or Point-to-Point Transmission Service.

 29.5 Network Customer Redispatch Obligation:

 As a condition to receiving Network Integration Transmission Service, the Network Customer agrees to redispatch its Network Resources as requested by the Transmission Provider pursuant to Section 33.2.

If the Eligible Customer elects not to execute the System Impact Study Agreement, its Application shall be deemed withdrawn and its deposit shall be returned with interest.

 31.2 System Impact Study Agreement and Cost Reimbursement:

 (i) The System Impact Study Agreement will clearly specify the Transmission Provider's estimate of the actual cost, and time for completion of the System Impact Study. The charge shall not exceed the actual cost of the study. In performing the System Impact Study, the Transmission Provider shall rely, to the extent reasonably practicable, on existing transmission planning studies. The Eligible Customer will not be assessed a charge for such existing studies; however, the Eligible Customer will be responsible for charges associated with any modifications to existing planning studies that are reasonably necessary to evaluate the impact of the Eligible Customer's request for service on the Transmission System.

 (ii) If in response to multiple Eligible Customers requesting service in relation to the same competitive solicitation, a single System Impact Study is sufficient for the Transmission Provider to accommodate the service requests, the costs of that study shall be pro-rated among the Eligible Customers.

 (iii) For System Impact Studies that the Transmission Provider conducts on its own behalf, the Transmission Provider shall record the cost of the System Impact Studies pursuant to Section 8.

 31.3 System Impact Study Procedures:

 Upon receipt of an executed System Impact Study Agreement, the Transmission Provider will use due diligence to complete the required System Impact Study within a sixty (60) day period. The System Impact Study shall identify (1) any system constraints identified with specificity by transmission element or flowgate, (2) redispatch options, (when requested by an Eligible Customer) including, to the extent possible, an estimate of the cost of redispatch, (3) available options for installation of automatic devices to curtail service (when requested by an Eligible Customer), and (4) additional Direct Assignment Facilities or Network Upgrades required to provide the requested service. For customers requesting the study of redispatch options, the System Impact Study shall (1) identify all resources located within the Transmission Provider's Control Area that can significantly contribute toward relieving the system constraint and (2) provide a measurement of each resource's impact on the system constraint. If the Transmission Provider possesses information indicating that any resource outside its Control Area could relieve the constraint, it shall identify each such resource in the System Impact Study. In the event that the Transmission Provider is unable to complete the required System Impact Study within such time period, it shall so notify the Eligible Customer and provide an estimated completion date along with an explanation of the reasons why additional time is required to complete the required studies. A copy of the completed System Impact Study and related work papers shall be made available to the Eligible Customer as soon as the System Impact Study is complete. The Transmission Provider will use the same due diligence in completing the System Impact Study for an Eligible Customer as it uses when completing studies for itself. The Transmission Provider shall notify the Eligible Customer immediately upon completion of the System Impact Study if the Transmission System will be adequate to accommodate all or part of a request for service or that no costs are likely to be incurred for new transmission facilities or upgrades. In order for a request to remain a Completed Application, within fifteen (15) days of completion of the System Impact Study the Eligible Customer must execute a Service Agreement or request the filing of an unexecuted Service Agreement, or the Application shall be deemed terminated and withdrawn.

 31.4 Facilities Study Procedures:

 If a System Impact Study indicates that additions or upgrades to the Transmission System are needed to supply the Eligible Customer's service request, the Transmission Provider, within thirty (30) days of the completion of the System Impact Study, shall tender to the Eligible Customer a Facilities Study Agreement pursuant to which the Eligible Customer shall agree to reimburse the Transmission Provider for performing the required Facilities Study. For a service request to remain a Completed Application, the Eligible Customer shall execute the Facilities Study Agreement and return it to the Transmission Provider within fifteen (15) days. If the Eligible Customer elects not to execute the Facilities Study Agreement, its Application shall be deemed withdrawn and its deposit shall be returned with interest. Upon receipt of an executed Facilities Study Agreement, the Transmission Provider will use due diligence to complete the required Facilities Study within a sixty (60) day period. If the Transmission Provider is unable to complete the Facilities Study in the allotted time period, the Transmission Provider shall notify the Eligible Customer and provide an estimate of the time needed to reach a final determination along with an explanation of the reasons that additional time is required to complete the study. When completed, the Facilities Study will include a good faith estimate of (i) the cost of Direct Assignment Facilities to be charged to the Eligible Customer, (ii) the Eligible Customer's appropriate share of the cost of any required Network Upgrades, and (iii) the time required to complete such construction and initiate the requested service. The Eligible Customer shall provide the Transmission Provider with a letter of credit or other reasonable form of security acceptable to the Transmission Provider equivalent to the costs of new facilities or upgrades consistent with commercial practices as established by the Uniform Commercial Code. The Eligible Customer shall have thirty (30) days to execute a Service Agreement or request the filing of an unexecuted Service Agreement and provide the required letter of credit or other form of security or the request no longer will be a Completed Application and shall be deemed terminated and withdrawn.

 32 Load Shedding and Curtailments

The Transmission Provider will notify all affected Network Customers in a timely manner of any scheduled Curtailment.

 32.2 Transmission Constraints:

 During any period when the Transmission Provider determines that a transmission constraint exists on the Transmission System, and such constraint may impair the reliability of the Transmission Provider's system, the Transmission Provider will take whatever actions, consistent with Good Utility Practice, that are reasonably necessary to maintain the reliability of the Transmission Provider's system. To the extent the Transmission Provider determines that the reliability of the Transmission System can be maintained by redispatching resources, the Transmission Provider will initiate procedures pursuant to the Network Operating Agreement to redispatch all Network Resources and the Transmission Provider's own resources on a least-cost basis without regard to the ownership of such resources. Any redispatch under this section may not unduly discriminate between the Transmission Provider's use of the Transmission System on behalf of its Native Load Customers and any Network Customer's use of the Transmission System to serve its designated Network Load.

 32.3 Cost Responsibility for Relieving Transmission Constraints:

 Whenever the Transmission Provider implements least-cost redispatch procedures in response to a transmission constraint, the Transmission Provider and Network Customers will each bear a proportionate share of the total redispatch cost based on their respective Load Ratio Shares.

 32.4 Curtailments of Scheduled Deliveries:

 If a transmission constraint on the Transmission Provider's Transmission System cannot be relieved through the implementation of least-cost redispatch procedures and the Transmission Provider determines that it is necessary to Curtail scheduled deliveries, the Parties shall Curtail such schedules in accordance with the Network Operating Agreement or pursuant to the Transmission Loading Relief procedures specified in Attachment J.

 32.5 Allocation of Curtailments:

 The Transmission Provider shall, on a non-discriminatory basis, Curtail the transaction(s) that effectively relieve the constraint. However, to the extent practicable and consistent with Good Utility Practice, any Curtailment will be shared by the Transmission Provider and Network Customer in proportion to their respective Load Ratio Shares. The Transmission Provider shall not direct the Network Customer to Curtail schedules to an extent greater than the Transmission Provider would Curtail the Transmission Provider's schedules under similar circumstances.

 32.6 Load Shedding:

 To the extent that a system contingency exists on the Transmission Provider's Transmission System and the Transmission Provider determines that it is necessary for the Transmission Provider and the Network Customer to shed load, the Parties shall shed load in accordance with previously established procedures under the Network Operating Agreement.

 32.7 System Reliability:

 Notwithstanding any other provisions of this Tariff, the Transmission Provider reserves the right, consistent with Good Utility Practice and on a not unduly discriminatory basis, to Curtail Network Integration Transmission Service without liability on the Transmission Provider's part for the purpose of making necessary adjustments to, changes in, or repairs on its lines, substations and facilities, and in cases where the continuance of Network Integration Transmission Service would endanger persons or property. In the event of any adverse condition(s) or disturbance(s) on the Transmission Provider's Transmission System or on any other system(s) directly or indirectly interconnected with the Transmission Provider's Transmission System, the Transmission Provider, consistent with Good Utility Practice, also may Curtail Network Integration Transmission Service in order to (i) limit the extent or damage of the adverse condition(s) or disturbance(s), (ii) prevent damage to generating or transmission facilities, or (iii) expedite restoration of service. The Transmission Provider will give the Network Customer as much advance notice as is practicable in the event of such Curtailment. Any Curtailment of Network Integration Transmission Service will not be unduly discriminatory relative to the Transmission Provider's use of the Transmission System on behalf of its Native Load Customers. The Transmission Provider shall specify the rate treatment and all related terms and conditions applicable in the event that the Network Customer fails to respond to established Load Shedding and Curtailment procedures.

 33 Rates and Charges

 The Network Customer shall pay the Transmission Provider for any Direct Assignment Facilities, Ancillary Services, and applicable study costs, consistent with Seattle City Light policy, along with the following:

 33.1 Monthly Demand Charge:

 SCHEDULE 2

 Reactive Supply and Voltage Control from

 Generation or Other Sources Service

 In order to maintain transmission voltages on the Transmission Provider's transmission facilities within acceptable limits, generation facilities and non-generation resources capable of providing this service that are under the control of the control area operator are operated to produce (or absorb) reactive power. Thus, Reactive Supply and Voltage Control from Generation or Other Sources Service must be provided for each transaction on the Transmission Provider's transmission facilities. The amount of Reactive Supply and Voltage Control from Generation or Other Sources Service that must be supplied with respect to the Transmission Customer's transaction will be determined based on the reactive power support necessary to maintain transmission voltages within limits that are generally accepted in the region and consistently adhered to by the Transmission Provider.

 Reactive Supply and Voltage Control from Generation or Other Sources Service is to be provided directly by the Transmission Provider (if the Transmission Provider is the Control Area operator) or indirectly by the Transmission Provider making arrangements with the Control Area operator that performs this service for the Transmission Provider's Transmission System. The Transmission Customer must purchase this service from the Transmission Provider or the Control Area operator. The charges for such service will be based on the rates set forth below. To the extent the Control Area operator performs this service for the Transmission Provider, charges to the Transmission Customer are to reflect only a pass-through of the costs charged to the Transmission Provider by the Control Area operator.

 For Generators Receiving PTP Service:

 Transmission Customers that are Generators Operators must comply with all applicable NERC and WECC standards by providing reactive power and voltage control at their point of interconnection with the SCL transmission system. Other requirements may be specified in the generator interconnection agreement (LGIA/SGIA), and voltage schedules will be periodically provided by SCL system dispatchers. As a Responsible Entity subject to the applicable NERC and WECC standards, Generator Operators accept full responsibility for monitoring and demonstrating compliance with these standards. SCL shall not be liable for sanctions if the Generator Operator fails to comply with these standards.

 For Network Transmission Customers:

 Network Transmission Customers that maintain an average monthly power factor at each Point of Delivery between 0.97 and 1.00 are subject to a charge under this schedule of $0.00 per kWh per month. Customers with an average monthly power factor of less than 0.97 will be charged in accordance with Seattle Municipal Code 21.49.080 (Power factor rate Schedule PF) in its current version or any successor. All other provisions of Schedule PF (or its successor) shall also apply to Network Transmission Customers.

 SCHEDULE 3

 Regulation and Frequency Response Service

 Regulation and Frequency Response Service is necessary to provide for the continuous balancing of resources (generation and interchange) with load and for maintaining scheduled Interconnection frequency at sixty cycles per second (60 Hz). Regulation and Frequency Response Service is accomplished by committing on-line generation whose output is raised or lowered (predominantly through the use of automatic generating control equipment) and by other non-generation resources capable of providing this service as necessary to follow the moment-by-moment changes in load. The obligation to maintain this balance between resources and load lies with the Transmission Provider (or the Control Area operator that performs this function for the Transmission Provider). The Transmission Provider must offer this service when the transmission service is used to serve load within its Control Area. The Transmission Customer must either purchase this service from the Transmission Provider or make alternative comparable arrangements to satisfy its Regulation and Frequency Response Service obligation. The amount of and charges for Regulation and Frequency Response Service are set forth below. To the extent the Control Area operator performs this service for the Transmission Provider, charges to the Transmission Customer are to reflect only a pass-through of the costs charged to the Transmission Provider by that Control Area operator.

 The Transmission Customer shall identify in its Application the manner by which it intends to provide for Regulation and Frequency Response Service. The use of any resources owned by parties other than the Transmission Provider shall conform to applicable Electric Reliability Organization (ERO) criteria.

 If Transmission Service is used to serve load within, or export power from the Seattle City Light Balancing Area, the Transmission Customer shall purchase Regulation and Frequency Response Service in the following amounts:

 The charges for Regulation and Frequency Response are:

 Point-to-Point Service

 1) Yearly Service $0.8468 per kW of Reserved Capacity per year 2) Monthly delivery $0.0706 per kW of Reserved Capacity per month 3) Weekly delivery $0.0163 per kW of Reserved Capacity per week 4) Daily delivery $0.0033 per kW of Reserved Capacity per day 5) Hourly delivery $0.2035 per MW of Reserved Capacity per hour Network integration Service

 6) Monthly delivery $1.2700 per kW of monthly network load per month

 SCHEDULE 4

 Energy Imbalance Service

 Energy Imbalance Service is provided when a difference occurs between the scheduled and the actual delivery of energy to a load located within a Control Area over a single hour. The Transmission Provider must offer this service when the transmission service is used to serve load within its Control Area. The Transmission Customer must either purchase this service from the Transmission Provider or make alternative comparable arrangements, which may include use of non-generation resources capable of providing this service, to satisfy its Energy Imbalance Service obligation. To the extent the Control Area operator performs this service for the Transmission Provider, charges to the Transmission Customer are to reflect only a pass-through of the costs charged to the Transmission Provider by that Control Area operator. The Transmission Provider may charge a Transmission Customer a penalty for either hourly energy imbalances under this Schedule or a penalty for hourly generator imbalances under Schedule 9 for imbalances occurring during the same hour, but not both unless the imbalances aggravate rather than offset each other.

 The Transmission Provider shall establish charges for energy imbalance based on the deviation bands as follows: (i) deviations within 1.5 percent (with a minimum of 2 MW) of the scheduled transaction to be applied hourly to any energy imbalance that occurs as a result of the Transmission Customer's scheduled transaction(s) will be netted on a monthly basis and settled financially, at the end of the month, at 100 percent of incremental or decremental cost; (ii) deviations greater than 1.5 percent up to 7.5 percent (or greater than 2 MW up to 10 MW) of the scheduled transaction to be applied hourly to any energy imbalance that occurs as a result of the Transmission Customer's scheduled transaction(s) will be settled financially, at the end of each month, at 110 percent of incremental cost or 90 percent of decremental cost, and (iii) deviations greater than 7.5 percent (or 10 MW) of the scheduled transaction to be applied hourly to any energy imbalance that occurs as a result of the Transmission Customer's scheduled transaction(s) will be settled financially, at the end of each month, at 125 percent of incremental cost or 75 percent of decremental cost.

 For purposes of this Schedule, incremental cost and decremental cost will be based on an hourly energy index in the Pacific Northwest. If no adequate hourly index exists, an alternative index will be used. The index to be used will be posted on the OASIS at least 30 days prior to use for determining the incremental cost.

 SCHEDULE 5

 Operating Reserve - Spinning Reserve Service

 Spinning Reserve Service is needed to serve load immediately in the event of a system contingency. Spinning Reserve Service may be provided by generating units that are on-line and loaded at less than maximum output and by non-generation resources capable of providing this service. The Transmission Provider must offer this service when the transmission service is used to serve load within its Control Area. The Transmission Customer must either purchase this service from the Transmission Provider or make alternative comparable arrangements to satisfy its Spinning Reserve Service obligation. The Service Agreement must specify the party responsible for providing Spinning Reserve Service (Responsible Entity). All schedules for Point-to-Point service under Section 13.8 of this tariff, must be E-Tagged by the Transmission Customer consistent with such specification of Responsible Entity. In accordance with WECC and NWPP operating criteria, 50% of the system contingency reserve obligations must be spinning.

 The amount of and charges for Spinning Reserve Service are set forth below. To the extent the Control Area operator performs this service for the Transmission Provider, charges to the Transmission Customer are to reflect only a pass-through of the costs charged to the Transmission Provider by that Control Area operator.

 The SCL Balancing Area is required by WECC to reserve sufficient spinning and non-spinning (supplemental) generating capacity to assist the interconnection in case of generator and transmission contingencies. To provide firm energy deliveries to, or receive firm energy deliveries at the SCL Balancing Area tie-lines with adjacent utilities, a Transmission Customer must purchase operating reserve services or schedule deliveries that explicitly designate the Sink Balancing Area as the Responsible Entity. As a member of the NWPP Reserve Sharing Group, SCL calculates its contingency reserve obligation (CRO) within its Balancing Authority Area based on the instantaneous amount of generating capacity connected to and generating, and the instantaneous load consuming power. The formula for computing the CRO is:

 3% of the output of all generating units, plus

 3% of the amount of load placed within the SCL Balancing Authority Area.

 Transmission Customers provided Firm PTP service must purchase Operating Reserve Service in an amount equal to the CRO calculation for the Transmission Customer's generating unit(s).

 Rates and Charges for Spinning Reserve Service:

 This amount of Operating Reserve Service - Spinning taken for each hour (Billing Determinant) is multiplied by the hourly capacity rate of:

 ORS Rate: $7.3582 per MW per hour

 Billing Determinant: 1.5% of Energy Received at a generator POR in MWh plus 1.5% of Energy Delivered to a load POD in MWh.

 SCHEDULE 6

 Operating Reserve - Supplemental Reserve Service

 Supplemental Reserve Service is needed to serve load in the event of a system contingency; however, it is not available immediately to serve load but rather within a short period of time. Supplemental Reserve Service may be provided by generating units that are on-line but unloaded, by quick-start generation or by interruptible load or other non-generation resources capable of providing this service. The Transmission Provider must offer this service when the transmission service is used to serve load within its Control Area. The Transmission Customer must either purchase this service from the Transmission Provider or make alternative comparable arrangements to satisfy its Supplemental Reserve Service obligation. The Service Agreement must specify the party responsible for providing Supplemental Reserve Service (Responsible Entity). All schedules for Point-to-Point service under Section 13.8 of this tariff, must be E-Tagged by the Transmission Customer consistent with such specification of Responsible Entity.

 The amount of and charges for Supplemental Reserve Service are set forth below. To the extent the Control Area operator performs this service for the Transmission Provider, charges to the Transmission Customer are to reflect only a pass-through of the costs charged to the Transmission Provider by that Control Area operator.

 The SCL Balancing Area is required by WECC to reserve sufficient spinning and non-spinning (supplemental) generating capacity to assist the interconnection in case of generator and transmission contingencies. To provide firm energy deliveries to, or receive firm energy deliveries at the SCL Balancing Area tie-lines with adjacent utilities, a Transmission Customer must purchase operating reserve services or schedule deliveries that explicitly designate the Sink Balancing Area as the Responsible Entity. As a member of the NWPP Reserve Sharing Group, SCL calculates its contingency reserve obligation (CRO) based on the instantaneous amount of generating capacity connected to and generating within its Balancing Area. The formula for computing the CRO is:

 3% of the output of all generating units, plus

 3% of the amount of load placed within the SCL Balancing Authority Area.

 Transmission Customers provided Firm PTP service must purchase Operating Reserve Service in an amount equal to the CRO calculation for the Transmission Customer's generating unit(s).

 Rates and Charges for Spinning Reserve Service:

 This amount of Operating Reserve Service - Spinning taken for each hour (Billing Determinant) is multiplied by the hourly capacity rate of:

 ORS Rate: $7.3582 per MW per hour

 Billing Determinant: 1.5% of Energy Received at a generator POR in MWh plus 1.5% of Energy Delivered to a load POD in MWh.

 SCHEDULE 7

 5) Discounts: Not Applicable

 6) Resales: The rates and rules governing charges and discounts stated above shall not apply to resales of transmission service, compensation for which shall be governed by section 23.1 of the Tariff.

 SCHEDULE 8

 Non-Firm Point-To-Point Transmission Service

 The Transmission Customer shall compensate the Transmission Provider for Non-Firm Point-To-Point Transmission Service up to the sum of the applicable charges set forth below:

 1) Monthly delivery: $0.3971 per kW of Reserved Capacity per month.

 2) Weekly delivery: $0.0916 per kW of Reserved Capacity per week.

 3) Daily delivery: $0.0183 per kW of Reserved Capacity per day.

 The total demand charge in any week, pursuant to a reservation for Daily delivery, shall not exceed the rate specified in section (2) above times the highest amount in kilowatts of Reserved Capacity in any day during such week.

 4) Hourly delivery: The basic charge shall be that agreed upon by the Parties at the time this service is reserved and in no event shall exceed $1.1455 per MWH. The total demand charge in any day, pursuant to a reservation for Hourly delivery, shall not exceed the rate specified in section (3) above times the highest amount in kilowatts of Reserved Capacity in any hour during such day. In addition, the total demand charge in any week, pursuant to a reservation for Hourly or Daily delivery, shall not exceed the rate specified in section (2) above times the highest amount in kilowatts of Reserved Capacity in any hour during such week.

 5) Discounts: Not Applicable

 6) Resales: The rates and rules governing charges and discounts stated above shall not apply to resales of transmission service, compensation for which shall be governed by section 23.1 of the Tariff.

 SCHEDULE 9

 Generator Imbalance Service

 Generator Imbalance Service is provided when a difference occurs between the output of a generator located in the Transmission Provider's Control Area and a delivery schedule from that generator to (1) another Control Area or (2) a load within the Transmission Provider's Control Area over a single hour. The Transmission Provider must offer this service, to the extent it is physically feasible to do so from its resources or from resources available to it, when Transmission Service is used to deliver energy from a generator located within its Control Area. The Transmission Customer must either purchase this service from the Transmission Provider or make alternative comparable arrangements, which may include use of non- generation resources capable of providing this service, to satisfy its Generator Imbalance Service obligation. To the extent the Control Area operator performs this service for the Transmission Provider, charges to the Transmission Customer are to reflect only a pass-through of the costs charged to the Transmission Provider by that Control Area Operator. The Transmission Provider may charge a Transmission Customer a penalty for either hourly generator imbalances under this Schedule or a penalty for hourly energy imbalances under Schedule 4 for imbalances occurring during the same hour, but not both unless the imbalances aggravate rather than offset each other.

 The Transmission Provider shall establish charges for generator imbalance based on the deviation bands as follows: (i) deviations within 1.5 percent (with a minimum of 2 MW) of the scheduled transaction to be applied hourly to any generator imbalance that occurs as a result of the Transmission Customer's scheduled transaction(s) will be netted on a monthly basis and settled financially, at the end of each month, at 100 percent of incremental or decremental cost, (ii) deviations greater than 1.5 percent up to 7.5 percent (or greater than 2 MW up to 10 MW) of the scheduled transaction to be applied hourly to any generator imbalance that occurs as a result of the Transmission Customer's scheduled transaction(s) will be settled financially, at the end of each month, at 110 percent of incremental cost or 90 percent of decremental cost, and (iii) deviations greater than 7.5 percent (or 10 MW) of the scheduled transaction to be applied hourly to any generator imbalance that occurs as a result of the Transmission Customer's scheduled transaction(s) will be settled at 125 percent of incremental cost or 75 percent of decremental cost, except that an intermittent resource will be exempt from this deviation band and will pay the deviation band charges for all deviations greater than the larger of 1.5 percent or 2 MW. An intermittent resource, for the limited purpose of this Schedule is an electric generator that is not dispatchable and cannot store its fuel source and therefore cannot respond to changes in system demand or respond to transmission security constraints.

 Notwithstanding the foregoing, deviations from scheduled transactions in order to respond to directives by the Transmission Provider, a balancing authority, or a reliability coordinator shall not be subject to the deviation bands identified above and, instead, shall be settled financially, at the end of the month, at 100 percent of incremental and decremental cost. Such directives may include instructions to correct frequency decay, respond to a reserve sharing event, or change output to relieve congestion.

 For purposes of this Schedule, incremental cost and decremental cost will be based on an hourly energy index in the Pacific Northwest. If no adequate hourly index exists, an alternative index will be used. The index to be used will be posted on the Transmission Provider's website at least 30 days prior to use for determining the incremental cost.

 Methodology to Assess Available Transfer Capability

 Due to the limited scope and highly networked topology of Seattle City Light (SCL) transmission facilities, SCL cannot estimate, accurately determine, or offer ATC using methods other than System Impact Studies performed for specific Transmission Service Requests (TSR). SCL will establish "posted paths" as defined by FERC Order 889 (see 18 CFR section 37.6(b)(1 at such time that an Eligible Customer submits a valid Application for Service and Transmission Service Request.

 ATTACHMENT D

 Methodology for Completing a System Impact Study

 SCL calculates system impacts by evaluating the requested service using powerflow modeling, including voltage stability analysis, and transient stability studies where applicable. Impacts may be evaluated using the Transmission Curtailment Risk Measure (TCRM) approach developed by ColumbiaGrid Puget Sound Area Study Team.

 PTP service is modeled as an injection at the bus where the Transmission Customer designates its Point of Receipt, and a corresponding withdraw of power at the bus where the Transmission Customer has designated its Point of Delivery.

 Creditworthiness Procedures

 For the purpose of determining the ability of the Transmission Customer to meet its obligations related to service hereunder, the Transmission Provider conducts credit reviews using standard commercial practices and in accordance with the following policy established by the City of Seattle.

 TRANSMISSION CREDIT POLICY

 The following is the Transmission Credit Policy for Seattle City Light effective _______________. Seattle City Light is formally known as the City Light Department ("Transmission Provider") and is a part of the City of Seattle, a municipality organized under the laws of the State of Washington. This Transmission Credit Policy may be updated periodically and is administered by the Department's Risk Oversight Group ("Risk"). Capitalized terms used but not defined herein shall have the meaning given in the City of Seattle, City Light Department Open Access Transmission Tariff ("OATT").

 Prior to the Transmission Provider entering into or renewing an agreement substantially in the form of Attachment A, A-1 or B to the OATT_ (each agreement, a "Transmission Service Agreement"), the credit worthiness of the Transmission Customer must be analyzed by Risk. Risk will inform the Transmission Provider when credit has been approved. After the Transmission Service Agreement is signed, Risk will establish the Transmission Customer in the Transmission Provider's credit and risk reporting system.

 The table below lists the current maximum unsecured credit limits for the Transmission Provider's Transmission Customers. Credit limits will be set based on the following factors: the lower of the credit ratings from Standard & Poor's Ratings Services and Moody's Investors Service, as categorized in the table below; and Risk's assessments of the Transmission Customer's financial strength and ability to pay on a timely basis.

 Once a Transmission Customer's credit limit has been reached, no additional sales under the Transmission Service Agreement may be made until payment or additional credit assurance is received. Additional credit assurance may be provided in the following forms: (1) an acceptable irrevocable Letter of Credit; (2) an acceptable Payment Guaranty; or (3) prepayment.

 An acceptable irrevocable Letter of Credit for the benefit of The City of Seattle must meet the following criteria: (1) it must be from a United States office of a commercial bank or trust company organized under the laws of the United States of America or a political subdivision thereof or from a foreign bank with a branch office located in the United States and (2) the Letter of Credit provider must have at least an "A" credit rating from two or more major credit rating agencies.

 The Transmission Provider will be notified when credit levels change and/or additional credit assurance is required. The posting of additional credit assurance or the curing of Risk's determination of non- creditworthiness is required within 1 business day of notification. Upon request, Risk will provide a written explanation for any change in credit levels or assurance requirements.

 Exposures are measured as a rolling 60-day notional exposure. If at any time a Transmission Customer fails to pay unsecured amounts owed to the Department, the customer's credit is reduced to zero.

 Contested determinations of credit or assurance requirements may be discussed with Risk's Credit Representative at 206-233-2756. The Department's Risk Oversight Group has final determination over contested Transmission credit matters.

 Section 2. Fast Track Process

 2.1 Applicability

 The Fast Track Process is available to an Interconnection Customer proposing to interconnect its Small Generating Facility with SCL's Transmission System if the Small Generating Facility is no larger than 2 MW and if the Interconnection Customer's proposed Small Generating Facility meets the codes, standards, and certification requirements of Attachments 3 and 4 of these procedures, or SCL has reviewed the design or tested the proposed Small Generating Facility and is satisfied that it is safe to operate.

 2.2 Initial Review

 Within 15 Business Days after SCL notifies the Interconnection Customer it has received a complete Interconnection Request, SCL shall perform an initial review using the screens set forth below, shall notify the Interconnection Customer of the results, and include with the notification copies of the analysis and data underlying SCL's determinations under the screens.

 2.2.1 Screens

 2.2.1.1 The proposed Small Generating Facility's Point of Interconnection must be on a portion of SCL's Distribution System that is subject to the Tariff.

 2.2.1.2 For interconnection of a proposed Small Generating Facility to a radial distribution circuit, the aggregated generation, including the proposed Small Generating Facility, on the circuit shall not exceed 15 % of the line section annual peak load as most recently measured at the substation. A line section is that portion of a Transmission Provider's electric system connected to a customer bounded by automatic sectionalizing devices or the end of the distribution line.

 2.2.1.3 For interconnection of a proposed Small Generating Facility to the load side of spot network protectors, the proposed Small Generating Facility must utilize an inverter-based equipment package and, together with the aggregated other inverter-based generation, shall not exceed the smaller of 5 % of a spot network's maximum load or 50 kW1.

 2.2.1.4 The proposed Small Generating Facility, in aggregation with other generation on the distribution circuit, shall not contribute more than 10 % to the distribution circuit's maximum fault current at the point on the high voltage (primary) level nearest the proposed point of change of ownership.

 2.2.1.5 The proposed Small Generating Facility, in aggregate with other generation on the distribution circuit, shall not cause any distribution protective devices and equipment (including, but not limited to, substation breakers, fuse cutouts, and line reclosers), or Interconnection Customer equipment on the system to exceed 87.5 % of the short circuit interrupting capability; nor shall the interconnection be proposed for a circuit that already exceeds 87.5 % of the short circuit interrupting capability.

 2.2.1.6 Using the table below, determine the type of interconnection to a primary distribution line. This screen includes a review of the type of electrical service provided to the Interconnecting Customer, including line configuration and the transformer connection to limit the potential for creating over-voltages on the Transmission Provider's electric power system due to a loss of ground during the operating time of any anti- islanding function.

 Primary Distribution Line Type Type of Interconnection to Primary Distribution Line Result/Criteria Three-phase, three wire 3-phase or single phase, phase-to-phase Pass screen Three-phase, four wire Effectively-grounded 3 phase or Single-phase, line-to-neutral Pass screen

 2.2.1.7 If the proposed Small Generating Facility is to be interconnected on single-phase shared secondary, the aggregate generation capacity on the shared secondary, including the proposed Small Generating Facility, shall not exceed 20 kW.

 2.2.1.8 If the proposed Small Generating Facility is single-phase and is to be interconnected on a center tap neutral of a 240 volt service, its addition shall not create an imbalance between the two sides of the 240 volt service of more than 20 % of the nameplate rating of the service transformer.

 2.2.1.9 The Small Generating Facility, in aggregate with other generation interconnected to the transmission side of a substation transformer feeding the circuit where the Small Generating Facility proposes to interconnect shall not exceed 10 MW in an area where there are known, or posted, transient stability limitations to generating units located in the general electrical vicinity (e.g., three or four transmission busses from the point of interconnection).

 2.2.1.10 No construction of facilities by SCL on its own system shall be required to accommodate the Small Generating Facility.

 2.2.2 If the proposed interconnection passes the screens, the Interconnection Request shall be approved and SCL will provide the Interconnection Customer an executable interconnection agreement within five Business Days after the determination.

 2.2.3 If the proposed interconnection fails the screens, but SCL determines that the Small Generating Facility may nevertheless be interconnected consistent with safety, reliability, and power quality standards, SCL shall provide the Interconnection Customer an executable interconnection agreement within five Business Days after the determination.

 2.2.4 If the proposed interconnection fails the screens, but SCL does not or cannot determine from the initial review that the Small Generating Facility may nevertheless be interconnected consistent with safety, reliability, and power quality standards unless the Interconnection Customer is willing to consider minor modifications or further study, SCL shall provide the Interconnection Customer with the opportunity to attend a customer options meeting.

 2.3 Customer Options Meeting

 If SCL determines the Interconnection Request cannot be approved without minor modifications at minimal cost; or a supplemental study or other additional studies or actions; or at significant cost to address safety, reliability, or power quality problems, within the five Business Day period after the determination, SCL shall notify the Interconnection Customer and provide copies of all data and analyses underlying its conclusion. Within ten Business Days of SCL's determination, SCL shall offer to convene a customer options meeting with SCL to review possible Interconnection Customer facility modifications or the screen analysis and related results, to determine what further steps are needed to permit the Small Generating Facility to be connected safely and reliably. At the time of notification of SCL's determination, or at the customer options meeting, SCL shall:

 2.3.1 Offer to perform facility modifications or minor modifications to SCL's electric system (e.g., changing meters, fuses, relay settings) and provide a non-binding good faith estimate of the limited cost to make such modifications to SCL's electric system; or

 2.3.2 Offer to perform a supplemental review if SCL concludes that the supplemental review might determine that the Small Generating Facility could continue to qualify for interconnection pursuant to the Fast Track Process, and provide a non-binding good faith estimate of the costs of such review; or

 2.3.3 Obtain the Interconnection Customer's agreement to continue evaluating the Interconnection Request under the section 3 Study Process.

 2.4 Supplemental Review

 If the Interconnection Customer agrees to a supplemental review, the Interconnection Customer shall agree in writing within 15 Business Days of the offer, and submit a deposit for the estimated costs. The Interconnection Customer shall be responsible for SCL's actual costs for conducting the supplemental review. The Interconnection Customer must pay any review costs that exceed the deposit within 20 Business Days of receipt of the invoice or resolution of any dispute. If the deposit exceeds the invoiced costs, SCL will return such excess within 20 Business Days of the invoice without interest.

 2.4.1 Within ten Business Days following receipt of the deposit for a supplemental review, SCL will determine if the Small Generating Facility can be interconnected safely and reliably.

 2.4.1.1 If so, SCL shall forward an executable interconnection agreement to the Interconnection Customer within five Business Days.

 2.4.1.2 If so, and Interconnection Customer facility modifications are required to allow the Small Generating Facility to be interconnected consistent with safety, reliability, and power quality standards under these procedures, SCL shall forward an executable interconnection agreement to the Interconnection Customer within five Business Days after confirmation that the Interconnection Customer has agreed to make the necessary changes at the Interconnection Customer's cost.

 2.4.1.3 If so, and minor modifications to SCL's electric system are required to allow the Small Generating Facility to be interconnected consistent with safety, reliability, and power quality standards under the Fast Track Process, SCL shall forward an executable interconnection agreement to the Interconnection Customer within ten Business Days that requires the Interconnection Customer to pay the costs of such system modifications prior to interconnection.

 4.1.2 The Interconnection Customer shall be responsible for its share of all reasonable expenses, including overheads, associated with (1) owning, operating, maintaining, repairing, and replacing its own Interconnection Facilities, and (2) operating, maintaining, repairing, and replacing SCL's Interconnection Facilities.

 4.2 Distribution Upgrades

 SCL shall design, procure, construct, install, and own the Distribution Upgrades described in Attachment 6 of this Agreement. If SCL and the Interconnection Customer agree, the Interconnection Customer may construct Distribution Upgrades that are located on land owned by the Interconnection Customer. The actual cost of the Distribution Upgrades, including overheads, shall be directly assigned to the Interconnection Customer.

 Article 5. Cost Responsibility for Network Upgrades

 5.1 Applicability

 No portion of this article 5 shall apply unless the interconnection of the Small Generating Facility requires Network Upgrades.

 5.2 Network Upgrades

 SCL or the Transmission Owner shall design, procure, construct, install, and own the Network Upgrades described in Attachment 6 of this Agreement. If SCL and the Interconnection Customer agree, the Interconnection Customer may construct Network Upgrades that are located on land owned by the Interconnection Customer. Unless SCL elects to pay for Network Upgrades, the actual cost of the Network Upgrades, including overheads, shall be borne initially by the Interconnection Customer.

 5.2.1 Repayment of Amounts Advanced for Network Upgrades

 The Interconnection Customer shall be entitled to a cash repayment, equal to the total amount paid to SCL and Affected System operator, if any, for Network Upgrades, including any tax gross-up or other tax-related payments associated with the Network Upgrades, and not otherwise refunded to the Interconnection Customer, to be paid to the Interconnection Customer on a dollar-for-dollar basis for the non-usage sensitive portion of transmission charges, as payments are made under SCL's Tariff and Affected System's Tariff for transmission services with respect to the Small Generating Facility. Any repayment shall include interest calculated in accordance with the methodology set forth in FERC's regulations at 18 C.F.R. section 35.19a(a)(2)(iii) from the date of any payment for Network Upgrades through the date on which the Interconnection Customer receives a repayment of such payment pursuant to this subparagraph. The Interconnection Customer may assign such repayment rights to any person.

 5.2.1.1 Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Interconnection Customer, SCL, and any applicable Affected System operators may adopt any alternative payment schedule that is mutually agreeable so long as SCL and said Affected System operators take one of the following actions no later than five years from the Commercial Operation Date: (1) return to the Interconnection Customer any amounts advanced for Network Upgrades not previously repaid, or (2) declare in writing that SCL or any applicable Affected System operators will continue to provide payments to the Interconnection Customer on a dollar-for-dollar basis for the non-usage sensitive portion of transmission charges, or develop an alternative schedule that is mutually agreeable and provides for the return of all amounts advanced for Network Upgrades not previously repaid; however, full reimbursement shall not extend beyond twenty (20) years from the commercial operation date.

 5.2.1.2 If the Small Generating Facility fails to achieve commercial operation, but it or another generating facility is later constructed and requires use of the Network Upgrades, SCL and Affected System operator shall at that time reimburse the Interconnection Customer for the amounts advanced for the Network Upgrades. Before any such reimbursement can occur, the Interconnection Customer, or the entity that ultimately constructs the generating facility, if different, is responsible for identifying the entity to which reimbursement must be made.

 5.3 Special Provisions for Affected Systems

 Nothing in this agreement shall obligate Transmission Provider to compensate an Affected System for the cost of any impact allegedly caused in furtherance of this agreement or by virtue of any activity undertaken by Interconnection Customer. Further, nothing in this agreement shall obligate Transmission Provider to provide for refunds, credits or repayment of any costs paid by Interconnection Customer to an Affected System .Unless SCL provides, under this Agreement, for the repayment of amounts advanced to any applicable Affected System operators for Network Upgrades, the Interconnection Customer and Affected System operator shall enter into an agreement that provides for such repayment. The agreement shall specify the terms governing payments to be made by the Interconnection Customer to Affected System operator as well as the repayment by Affected System operator.

 5.4 Rights Under Other Agreements

 Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, nothing herein shall be construed as relinquishing or foreclosing any rights, including but not limited to firm transmission rights, capacity rights, transmission congestion rights, or transmission credits, that the Interconnection Customer shall be entitled to, now or in the future, under any other agreement or tariff as a result of, or otherwise associated with, the transmission capacity, if any, created by the Network Upgrades, including the right to obtain cash reimbursements or transmission credits for transmission service that is not associated with the Small Generating Facility.

If the Interconnection Customer's cost responsibility exceeds its previous aggregate payments, SCL shall invoice the Interconnection Customer for the amount due and the Interconnection Customer shall make payment to SCL within 30 calendar days. If the Interconnection Customer's previous aggregate payments exceed its cost responsibility under this Agreement, SCL shall refund to the Interconnection Customer an amount equal to the difference within 30 calendar days of the final accounting report.

 6.2 Milestones

 The Parties shall agree on milestones for which each Party is responsible and list them in Attachment 4 of this Agreement. A Party's obligations under this provision may be extended by agreement. If a Party anticipates that it will be unable to meet a milestone for any reason other than a Force Majeure Event, it shall immediately notify the other Party of the reason(s) for not meeting the milestone and (1) propose the earliest reasonable alternate date by which it can attain this and future milestones, and (2) requesting appropriate amendments to Attachment 4. The Party affected by the failure to meet a milestone shall not unreasonably withhold agreement to such an amendment unless it will suffer significant uncompensated economic or operational harm from the delay, (2) attainment of the same milestone has previously been delayed, or (3) it has reason to believe that the delay in meeting the milestone is intentional or unwarranted notwithstanding the circumstances explained by the Party proposing the amendment.

 6.3 Financial Security Arrangements

 At least 20 Business Days prior to the commencement of the design, procurement, installation, or construction of a discrete portion of SCL's Interconnection Facilities and Upgrades, the Interconnection Customer shall provide SCL, at the Interconnection Customer's option, a guarantee, a surety bond, letter of credit or other form of security that is reasonably acceptable to SCL and is consistent with the Uniform Commercial Code of the jurisdiction where the Point of Interconnection is located. Such security for payment shall be in an amount sufficient to cover the costs for constructing, designing, procuring, and installing the applicable portion of SCL's Interconnection Facilities and Upgrades and shall be reduced on a dollar-for-dollar basis for payments made to SCL under this Agreement during its term. In addition:

 6.3.1 The guarantee must be made by an entity that meets the creditworthiness requirements of SCL, and contain terms and conditions that guarantee payment of any amount that may be due from the Interconnection Customer, up to an agreed-to maximum amount.

 6.3.2 The letter of credit or surety bond must be issued by a financial institution or insurer reasonably acceptable to SCL and must specify a reasonable expiration date.

 7.1 Assignment

 This Agreement may be assigned by either Party upon 15 Business Days prior written notice and opportunity to object by the other Party; provided that:

 7.1.1 Either Party may assign this Agreement without the consent of the other Party to any affiliate of the assigning Party with an equal or greater credit rating and with the legal authority and operational ability to satisfy the obligations of the assigning Party under this Agreement, provided that the Interconnection Customer promptly notifies SCL of any such assignment;

 7.1.2 The Interconnection Customer shall have the right to assign this Agreement, without the consent of SCL, for collateral security purposes to aid in providing financing for the Small Generating Facility, provided that the Interconnection Customer will promptly notify SCL of any such assignment.

 7.1.3 Any attempted assignment that violates this article is void and ineffective. Assignment shall not relieve a Party of its obligations, nor shall a Party's obligations be enlarged, in whole or in part, by reason thereof. An assignee is responsible for meeting the same financial, credit, and insurance obligations as the Interconnection Customer. Where required, consent to assignment will not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed.

 7.2 Limitation of Liability

 Each Party's liability to the other Party for any loss, cost, claim, injury, liability, or expense, including reasonable attorney's fees, relating to or arising from any act or omission in its performance of this Agreement, shall be limited to the amount of direct damage actually incurred. In no event shall either Party be liable to the other Party for any indirect, special, consequential, or punitive damages, except as authorized by this Agreement.

 7.3 Indemnity

 7.3.1 This provision protects each Party from liability incurred to third parties as a result of carrying out the provisions of this Agreement. Liability under this provision is exempt from the general limitations on liability found in article 7.2.

 7.3.2 The Parties shall at all times indemnify, defend, and hold the other Party harmless from, any and all damages, losses, claims, including claims and actions relating to injury to or death of any person or damage to property, demand, suits, recoveries, costs and expenses, court costs, attorney fees, and all other obligations by or to third parties, arising out of or resulting from the other Party's action or failure to meet its obligations under this Agreement on behalf of the indemnifying Party, except in cases of gross negligence or intentional wrongdoing by the indemnified Party.

 7.3.3 If an indemnified person is entitled to indemnification under this article as a result of a claim by a third party, and the indemnifying Party fails, after notice and reasonable opportunity to proceed under this article, to assume the defense of such claim, such indemnified person may at the expense of the indemnifying Party contest, settle or consent to the entry of any judgment with respect to, or pay in full, such claim.

 7.3.4 If an indemnifying party is obligated to indemnify and hold any indemnified person harmless under this article, the amount owing to the indemnified person shall be the amount of such indemnified person's actual loss, net of any insurance or other recovery.

 7.3.5 Promptly after receipt by an indemnified person of any claim or notice of the commencement of any action or administrative or legal proceeding or investigation as to which the indemnity provided for in this article may apply, the indemnified person shall notify the indemnifying party of such fact. Any failure of or delay in such notification shall not affect a Party's indemnification obligation unless such failure or delay is materially prejudicial to the indemnifying party.

 7.4 Consequential Damages

 Other than as expressly provided for in this Agreement, neither Party shall be liable under any provision of this Agreement for any losses, damages, costs or expenses for any special, indirect, incidental, consequential, or punitive damages, including but not limited to loss of profit or revenue, loss of the use of equipment, cost of capital, cost of temporary equipment or services, whether based in whole or in part in contract, in tort, including negligence, strict liability, or any other theory of liability; provided, however, that damages for which a Party may be liable to the other Party under another agreement will not be considered to be special, indirect, incidental, or consequential damages hereunder.

 7.5 Force Majeure

 7.5.1 As used in this article, a Force Majeure Event shall mean "any act of God, labor disturbance, act of the public enemy, war, insurrection, riot, fire, storm or flood, explosion, breakage or accident to machinery or equipment, any order, regulation or restriction imposed by governmental, military or lawfully established civilian authorities, or any other cause beyond a Party's control. A Force Majeure Event does not include an act of negligence or intentional wrongdoing."

 7.5.2 If a Force Majeure Event prevents a Party from fulfilling any obligations under this Agreement, the Party affected by the Force Majeure Event (Affected Party) shall promptly notify the other Party, either in writing or via the telephone, of the existence of the Force Majeure Event. The notification must specify in reasonable detail the circumstances of the Force Majeure Event, its expected duration, and the steps that the Affected Party is taking to mitigate the effects of the event on its performance. The Affected Party shall keep the other Party informed on a continuing basis of developments relating to the Force Majeure Event until the event ends. The Affected Party will be entitled to suspend or modify its performance of obligations under this Agreement (other than the obligation to make payments) only to the extent that the effect of the Force Majeure Event cannot be mitigated by the use of Reasonable Efforts. The Affected Party will use Reasonable Efforts to resume its performance as soon as possible.

 7.6 Default

 7.6.1 No Default shall exist where such failure to discharge an obligation (other than the payment of money) is the result of a Force Majeure Event as defined in this Agreement or the result of an act or omission of the other Party. Upon a Default, the non-defaulting Party shall give written notice of such Default to the defaulting Party. Except as provided in article 7.6.2, the defaulting Party shall have 60 calendar days from receipt of the Default notice within which to cure such Default; provided however, if such Default is not capable of cure within 60 calendar days, the defaulting Party shall commence such cure within 20 calendar days after notice and continuously and diligently complete such cure within six months from receipt of the Default notice; and, if cured within such time, the Default specified in such notice shall cease to exist.

 7.6.2 If a Default is not cured as provided in this article, or if a Default is not capable of being cured within the period provided for herein, the non-defaulting Party shall have the right to terminate this Agreement by written notice at any time until cure occurs, and be relieved of any further obligation hereunder and, whether or not that Party terminates this Agreement, to recover from the defaulting Party all amounts due hereunder, plus all other damages and remedies to which it is entitled at law or in equity. The provisions of this article will survive termination of this Agreement.

 Article 8. Insurance

 8.1 The Interconnection Customer shall, at its own expense, maintain in force general liability insurance without any exclusion for liabilities related to the interconnection undertaken pursuant to this Agreement. The amount of such insurance shall be sufficient to insure against all reasonably foreseeable direct liabilities given the size and nature of the generating equipment being interconnected, the interconnection itself, and the characteristics of the system to which the interconnection is made. The Interconnection Customer shall obtain additional insurance only if necessary as a function of owning and operating a generating facility. Such insurance shall be obtained from an insurance provider authorized to do business in the State where the interconnection is located. Certification that such insurance is in effect shall be provided upon request of SCL, except that the Interconnection Customer shall show proof of insurance to SCL no later than ten Business Days prior to the anticipated commercial operation date. An Interconnection Customer of sufficient credit-worthiness may propose to self-insure for such liabilities, and such a proposal shall not be unreasonably rejected.

 8.2 SCL agrees to maintain general liability insurance or self-insurance consistent with SCL's commercial practice. Such insurance or self- insurance shall not exclude coverage for SCL's liabilities undertaken pursuant to this Agreement.

 8.3 The Parties further agree to notify each other whenever an accident or incident occurs resulting in any injuries or damages that are included within the scope of coverage of such insurance, whether or not such coverage is sought.

 Article 9. Confidentiality

 9.1 Confidential Information shall mean any confidential and/or proprietary information provided by one Party to the other Party that is clearly marked or otherwise designated "Confidential." For purposes of this Agreement all design, operating specifications, and metering data provided by the Interconnection Customer shall be deemed Confidential Information regardless of whether it is clearly marked or otherwise designated as such.

 9.2 Confidential Information does not include information previously in the public domain, required to be publicly submitted or divulged by Governmental Authorities (after notice to the other Party and after exhausting any opportunity to oppose such publication or release), or necessary to be divulged in an action to enforce this Agreement. Each Party receiving Confidential Information shall hold such information in confidence and shall not disclose it to any third party nor to the public without the prior written authorization from the Party providing that information, except to fulfill obligations under this Agreement, or to fulfill legal or regulatory requirements.

 9.2.1 Each Party shall employ at least the same standard of care to protect Confidential Information obtained from the other Party as it employs to protect its own Confidential Information.

 9.2.2 Each Party is entitled to equitable relief, by injunction or otherwise, to enforce its rights under this provision to prevent the release of Confidential Information without bond or proof of damages, and may seek other remedies available at law or in equity for breach of this provision.

 9.3 Notwithstanding anything in this article to the contrary, and pursuant to 18 CFR section 1b.20, if FERC, during the course of an investigation or otherwise, requests information from one of the Parties that is otherwise required to be maintained in confidence pursuant to this Agreement, the Party shall provide the requested information to FERC, within the time provided for in the request for information. In providing the information to FERC, the Party may, consistent with 18 CFR section 388.112, request that the information be treated as confidential and non- public by FERC and that the information be withheld from public disclosure. Parties are prohibited from notifying the other Party to this Agreement prior to the release of the Confidential Information to FERC. The Party shall notify the other Party to this Agreement when it is notified by FERC that a request to release Confidential Information has been received by FERC, at which time either of the Parties may respond before such information would be made public, pursuant to 18 CFR section 388.112. Requests from a state regulatory body conducting a confidential investigation shall be treated in a similar manner if consistent with the applicable state rules and regulations.

 Article 10. Disputes

 10.1 The Parties agree to attempt to resolve all disputes arising out of the interconnection process according to the provisions of this article.

 10.2 In the event of a dispute, either Party shall provide the other Party with a written Notice of Dispute. Such Notice shall describe in detail the nature of the dispute.

 10.3 Reserved.

 10.4 Reserved.

 10.5 Each Party agrees to conduct all negotiations in good faith and will be responsible for one-half of any costs paid to neutral third-parties.

 10.6 If the attempted dispute resolution fails, either Party may exercise whatever rights and remedies it may have in equity or law consistent with the terms of this Agreement.

 Article 11. Taxes

 11.1 The Parties agree to follow all applicable tax laws and regulations, consistent with status of Transmission Provider as a municipal entity under applicable tax law and regulations.

 11.2 Each Party shall cooperate with the other to maintain the other Party's tax status. Nothing in this Agreement is intended to adversely affect SCL's tax exempt status with respect to the issuance of bonds including, but not limited to, local furnishing bonds.

 Article 12. Miscellaneous

 12.1 Governing Law, Regulatory Authority, and Rules

 The validity, interpretation and enforcement of this Agreement and each of its provisions shall be governed by the laws of the state of Washington (where the Point of Interconnection is located), without regard to its conflicts of law principles.

 The Parties may amend this Agreement by a written instrument duly executed by both Parties, or under article 12.12 of this Agreement.

 12.3 No Third-Party Beneficiaries

 This Agreement is not intended to and does not create rights, remedies, or benefits of any character whatsoever in favor of any persons, corporations, associations, or entities other than the Parties, and the obligations herein assumed are solely for the use and benefit of the Parties, their successors in interest and where permitted, their assigns.

 12.4 Waiver

 12.4.1 The failure of a Party to this Agreement to insist, on any occasion, upon strict performance of any provision of this Agreement will not be considered a waiver of any obligation, right, or duty of, or imposed upon, such Party.

 12.4.2 Any waiver at any time by either Party of its rights with respect to this Agreement shall not be deemed a continuing waiver or a waiver with respect to any other failure to comply with any other obligation, right, duty of this Agreement. Termination or default of this Agreement for any reason by Interconnection Customer shall not constitute a waiver of the Interconnection Customer's legal rights to obtain an interconnection from SCL. Any waiver of this Agreement shall, if requested, be provided in writing.

 12.5 Entire Agreement

 This Agreement, including all Attachments, constitutes the entire agreement between the Parties with reference to the subject matter hereof, and supersedes all prior and contemporaneous understandings or agreements, oral or written, between the Parties with respect to the subject matter of this Agreement. There are no other agreements, representations, warranties, or covenants which constitute any part of the consideration for, or any condition to, either Party's compliance with its obligations under this Agreement.

 12.6 Multiple Counterparts

 This Agreement may be executed in two or more counterparts, each of which is deemed an original but all constitute one and the same instrument.

 12.7 No Partnership

 This Agreement shall not be interpreted or construed to create an association, joint venture, agency relationship, or partnership between the Parties or to impose any partnership obligation or partnership liability upon either Party. Neither Party shall have any right, power or authority to enter into any agreement or undertaking for, or act on behalf of, or to act as or be an agent or representative of, or to otherwise bind, the other Party.

 12.8 Severability

 If any provision or portion of this Agreement shall for any reason be held or adjudged to be invalid or illegal or unenforceable by any court of competent jurisdiction or other Governmental Authority, (1) such portion or provision shall be deemed separate and independent, (2) the Parties shall negotiate in good faith to restore insofar as practicable the benefits to each Party that were affected by such ruling, and (3) the remainder of this Agreement shall remain in full force and effect.

 12.9 Security Arrangements

 Infrastructure security of electric system equipment and operations and control hardware and software is essential to ensure day-to-day reliability and operational security. FERC expects all Transmission Providers, market participants, and Interconnection Customers interconnected to electric systems to comply with the recommendations offered by the President's Critical Infrastructure Protection Board and, eventually, best practice recommendations from the electric reliability authority. All public utilities are expected to meet basic standards for system infrastructure and operational security, including physical, operational, and cyber-security practices.

 12.10 Environmental Releases

 Each Party shall notify the other Party, first orally and then in writing, of the release of any hazardous substances, any asbestos or lead abatement activities, or any type of remediation activities related to the Small Generating Facility or the Interconnection Facilities, each of which may reasonably be expected to affect the other Party. The notifying Party shall (1) provide the notice as soon as practicable, provided such Party makes a good faith effort to provide the notice no later than 24 hours after such Party becomes aware of the occurrence, and (2) promptly furnish to the other Party copies of any publicly available reports filed with any governmental authorities addressing such events.

 12.11 Subcontractors

 Nothing in this Agreement shall prevent a Party from utilizing the services of any subcontractor as it deems appropriate to perform its obligations under this Agreement; provided, however, that each Party shall require its subcontractors to comply with all applicable terms and conditions of this Agreement in providing such services and each Party shall remain primarily liable to the other Party for the performance of such subcontractor.

 12.11.1 The creation of any subcontract relationship shall not relieve the hiring Party of any of its obligations under this Agreement. The hiring Party shall be fully responsible to the other Party for the acts or omissions of any subcontractor the hiring Party hires as if no subcontract had been made; provided, however, that in no event shall SCL be liable for the actions or inactions of the Interconnection Customer or its subcontractors with respect to obligations of the Interconnection Customer under this Agreement. Any applicable obligation imposed by this Agreement upon the hiring Party shall be equally binding upon, and shall be construed as having application to, any subcontractor of such Party.

 12.11.2 The obligations under this article will not be limited in any way by any limitation of subcontractor's insurance.

 Transmission Provider's Interconnection Facilities shall mean all facilities and equipment owned, controlled, or operated by the Transmission Provider from the Point of Change of Ownership to the Point of Interconnection as identified in Appendix A to the Standard Large Generator Interconnection Agreement, including any modifications, additions or upgrades to such facilities and equipment. Transmission Provider's Interconnection Facilities are sole use facilities and shall not include Distribution Upgrades, Stand Alone Network Upgrades or Network Upgrades.

 Transmission System shall mean the facilities owned, controlled or operated by the Transmission Provider or Transmission Owner that are used to provide transmission service under the Tariff.

 Trial Operation shall mean the period during which Interconnection Customer is engaged in on-site test operations and commissioning of the Generating Facility prior to Commercial Operation.

 Section 2. Scope and Application

 2.1 Application of Standard Large Generator Interconnection Procedures.

 Sections 2 through 13 apply to processing an Interconnection Request pertaining to a Large Generating Facility.

 2.2 Comparability.

 Transmission Provider shall receive, process and analyze all Interconnection Requests in a timely manner as set forth in this LGIP. Transmission Provider will use the same Reasonable Efforts in processing and analyzing Interconnection Requests from all Interconnection Customers, whether the Generating Facilities are owned by Transmission Provider, its subsidiaries or Affiliates or others.

 2.3 Base Case Data.

 Transmission Provider shall provide base power flow, short circuit and stability databases, including all underlying assumptions, and contingency list upon request subject to confidentiality provisions in LGIP Section 13.1. Transmission Provider is permitted to require that Interconnection Customer sign a confidentiality agreement before the release of commercially sensitive information or Critical Energy Infrastructure Information in the Base Case data. Such databases and lists, hereinafter referred to as Base Cases, shall include all (1) generation projects and (ii) transmission projects, including merchant transmission projects that are proposed for the Transmission System for which a transmission expansion plan has been submitted and approved by the applicable authority.

 2.4 No Applicability to Transmission Service.

 Nothing in this LGIP shall constitute a request for transmission service or confer upon an Interconnection Customer any right to receive transmission service.

 Section 3. Interconnection Requests

 3.1 General.

 An Interconnection Customer shall submit to Transmission Provider an Interconnection Request in the form of Appendix 1 to this LGIP and a refundable deposit of $10,000. Transmission Provider shall apply the deposit toward the cost of an Interconnection Feasibility Study. Interconnection Customer shall submit a separate Interconnection Request for each site and may submit multiple Interconnection Requests for a single site. Interconnection Customer must submit a deposit with each Interconnection Request even when more than one request is submitted for a single site. An Interconnection Request to evaluate one site at two different voltage levels shall be treated as two Interconnection Requests.

 At Interconnection Customer's option, Transmission Provider and Interconnection Customer will identify alternative Point(s) of Interconnection and configurations at the Scoping Meeting to evaluate in this process and attempt to eliminate alternatives in a reasonable fashion given resources and information available. Interconnection Customer will select the definitive Point(s) of Interconnection to be studied no later than the execution of the Interconnection Feasibility Study Agreement.

 3.2 Identification of Types of Interconnection Services.

 At the time the Interconnection Request is submitted, Interconnection Customer must request either Energy Resource Interconnection Service or Network Resource Interconnection Service, as described; provided, however, any Interconnection Customer requesting Network Resource Interconnection Service may also request that it be concurrently studied for Energy Resource Interconnection Service, up to the point when an Interconnection Facility Study Agreement is executed. Interconnection Customer may then elect to proceed with Network Resource Interconnection Service or to proceed under a lower level of interconnection service to the extent that only certain upgrades will be completed.

 3.2.1 Energy Resource Interconnection Service.

 3.2.1.1 The Product. Energy Resource Interconnection Service allows Interconnection Customer to connect the Large Generating Facility to the Transmission System and be eligible to deliver the Large Generating Facility's output using the existing firm or non-firm capacity of the Transmission System on an "as available" basis. Energy Resource Interconnection Service does not in and of itself convey any right to deliver electricity to any specific customer or Point of Delivery.

 3.2.1.2 The Study. The study consists of short circuit/fault duty, steady state (thermal and voltage) and stability analyses. The short circuit/fault duty analysis would identify direct Interconnection Facilities required and the Network Upgrades necessary to address short circuit issues associated with the Interconnection Facilities. The stability and steady state studies would identify necessary upgrades to allow full output of the proposed Large Generating Facility and would also identify the maximum allowed output, at the time the study is performed, of the interconnecting Large Generating Facility without requiring additional Network Upgrades.

 3.2.2 Network Resource Interconnection Service.

 3.2.2.1 The Product. Transmission Provider must conduct the necessary studies and construct the Network Upgrades needed to integrate the Large Generating Facility (1) in a manner comparable to that in which Transmission Provider integrates its generating facilities to serve native load customers; or (2) in an ISO or RTO with market based congestion management, in the same manner as all other Network Resources. Network Resource Interconnection Service Allows Interconnection Customer 's Large Generating Facility to be designated as a Network Resource, up to the Large Generating Facility's full output, on the same basis as all other existing Network Resources interconnected to Transmission Provider's Transmission System, and to be studied as a Network Resource on the assumption that such a designation will occur.

 3.2.2.2 The Study. The Interconnection Study for Network Resource Interconnection Service shall assure that Interconnection Customer's Large Generating Facility meets the requirements for Network Resource Interconnection Service and as a general matter, that such Large Generating Facility's interconnection is also studied with Transmission Provider's Transmission System at peak load, under a variety of severely stressed conditions, to determine whether, with the Large Generating Facility at full output, the aggregate of generation in the local area can be delivered to the aggregate of load on Transmission Provider's Transmission System, consistent with Transmission Provider's reliability criteria and procedures. This approach assumes that some portion of existing Network Resources are displaced by the output of Interconnection Customer's Large Generating Facility. Network Resource Interconnection Service in and of itself does not convey any right to deliver electricity to any specific customer or Point of Delivery.

 3.3 Valid Interconnection Request.

 3.3.1 Initiating an Interconnection Request.

 To initiate an Interconnection Request, Interconnection Customer must submit all of the following: (i) a $10,000 deposit, (ii) a completed application in the form of Appendix 1, and (iii) demonstration of Site Control or a posting of an additional deposit of $10,000. Such deposits shall be applied toward any Interconnection Studies pursuant to the Interconnection Request. If Interconnection Customer demonstrates Site Control within the cure period specified in Section 3.3.3 after submitting its Interconnection Request, the additional deposit shall be refundable; otherwise, all such deposit(s), additional and initial, become non- refundable.

 The expected In-Service Date of the new Large Generating Facility or increase in capacity of the existing Generating Facility shall be no more than the process window for the regional expansion planning period (or in the absence of a regional planning process, the process window for Transmission Provider's expansion planning period) not to exceed seven years from the date the Interconnection Request is received by Transmission Provider, unless Interconnection Customer demonstrates that engineering, permitting and construction of the new Large Generating Facility or increase in capacity of the existing Generating Facility will take longer than the regional expansion planning period. The In-Service Date may succeed the date the Interconnection Request is received by Transmission Provider by a period up to ten years, or longer where Interconnection Customer and Transmission Provider agree, such agreement not to be unreasonably withheld.

 3.3.2 Acknowledgment of Interconnection Request.

 Transmission Provider shall acknowledge receipt of the Interconnection Request within five (5) Business Days of receipt of the request and attach a copy of the received Interconnection Request to the acknowledgement.

 3.3.3 Deficiencies in Interconnection Request.

 An Interconnection Request will not be considered to be a valid request until all items in Section 3.3.1 have been received by Transmission Provider. If an Interconnection Request fails to meet the requirements set forth in Section 3.3.1, Transmission Provider shall notify Interconnection Customer within five (5) Business Days of receipt of the initial Interconnection Request of the reasons for such failure and that the Interconnection Request does not constitute a valid request. Interconnection Customer shall provide Transmission Provider the additional requested information needed to constitute a valid request within ten (10) Business Days after receipt of such notice. Failure by Interconnection Customer to comply with this Section 3.3.3 shall be treated in accordance with Section 3.6.

 3.3.4 Scoping Meeting.

 Within ten (10) Business Days after receipt of a valid Interconnection Request, Transmission Provider shall establish a date agreeable to Interconnection Customer for the Scoping Meeting, and such date shall be no later than thirty (30) Calendar Days from receipt of the valid Interconnection Request, unless otherwise mutually agreed upon by the Parties.

 The purpose of the Scoping Meeting shall be to discuss alternative interconnection options, to exchange information including any transmission data that would reasonably be expected to impact such interconnection options, to analyze such information and to determine the potential feasible Points of Interconnection. Transmission Provider and Interconnection Customer will bring to the meeting such technical data, including, but not limited to: (i) general facility loadings, (ii) general instability issues, (iii) general short circuit issues, (iv) general voltage issues, and (v) general reliability issues as may be reasonably required to accomplish the purpose of the meeting. Transmission Provider and Interconnection Customer will also bring to the meeting personnel and other resources as may be reasonably required to accomplish the purpose of the meeting in the time allocated for the meeting. On the basis of the meeting, Interconnection Customer shall designate its Point of Interconnection, pursuant to Section 6.1, and one or more available alternative Point(s) of Interconnection. The duration of the meeting shall be sufficient to accomplish its purpose.

 3.4 Website or OASIS Posting.

 Transmission Provider will maintain on its website or OASIS a list of all Interconnection Requests. The list will identify, for each Interconnection Request: (i) the maximum summer and winter megawatt electrical output; (ii) the location by county and state; (iii) the station or transmission line or lines where the interconnection will be made; (iv) the projected In-Service Date; (v) the status of the Interconnection Request, including Queue Position; (vi) the type of Interconnection Service being requested; and (vii) the availability of any studies related to the Interconnection Request; (viii) the date of the Interconnection Request; (ix) the type of Generating Facility to be constructed (combined cycle, base load or combustion turbine and fuel type); and (x) for Interconnection Requests that have not resulted in a completed interconnection, an explanation as to why it was not completed. The list will not disclose the identity of Interconnection Customer until Interconnection Customer executes an LGIA. Before holding a Scoping Meeting with its Affiliate, Transmission Provider shall post on its website or OASIS an advance notice of its intent to do so. Transmission Provider shall post to its Website or OASIS any deviations from the study timelines set forth herein. Interconnection Study reports and Optional Interconnection Study reports shall be posted to Transmission Provider's Website or OASIS subsequent to the meeting between Interconnection Customer and Transmission Provider to discuss the applicable study results. Transmission Provider shall also post any known deviations in the Large Generating Facility's In-Service Date.

 3.5 Coordination with Affected Systems.

 Transmission Provider will coordinate the conduct of any studies required to determine the impact of the Interconnection Request on Affected Systems with Affected System Operators and, if possible, include those results (if available) in its applicable Interconnection Study within the time frame specified in this LGIP. Transmission Provider will include such Affected System Operators in all meetings held with Interconnection Customer as required by this LGIP. Interconnection Customer will cooperate with Transmission Provider in all matters related to the conduct of studies and the determination of modifications to Affected Systems. A Transmission Provider which may be an Affected System shall cooperate with Transmission Provider with whom interconnection has been requested in all matters related to the conduct of studies and the determination of modifications to Affected Systems.

 3.6 Withdrawal.

 Interconnection Customer may withdraw its Interconnection Request at any time by written notice of such withdrawal to Transmission Provider. In addition, if Interconnection Customer fails to adhere to all requirements of this LGIP, except as provided in Section 13.5 (Disputes), Transmission Provider shall deem the Interconnection Request to be withdrawn and shall provide written notice to Interconnection Customer of the deemed withdrawal and an explanation of the reasons for such deemed withdrawal. Upon receipt of such written notice, Interconnection Customer shall have fifteen (15) Business Days in which to either respond with information or actions that cures the deficiency or to notify Transmission Provider of its intent to pursue Dispute Resolution.

 Withdrawal shall result in the loss of Interconnection Customer's Queue Position. If an Interconnection Customer disputes the withdrawal and loss of its Queue Position, then during Dispute Resolution, Interconnection Customer's Interconnection Request is eliminated from the queue until such time that the outcome of Dispute Resolution would restore its Queue Position. An Interconnection Customer that withdraws or is deemed to have withdrawn its Interconnection Request shall pay to Transmission Provider all costs that Transmission Provider prudently incurs with respect to that Interconnection Request prior to Transmission Provider's receipt of notice described above. Interconnection Customer must pay all monies due to Transmission Provider before it is allowed to obtain any Interconnection Study data or results.

 Transmission Provider shall (i) update the OASIS Queue Position posting and (ii) refund to Interconnection Customer any portion of Interconnection Customer's deposit or study payments that exceeds the costs that Transmission Provider has incurred, including interest. Applicable interest shall be calculated in accordance with the methodology specified for interest on deposits in the electric service connection provisions in the Seattle Municipal Code, 21.49.110.X. The interest rate is earned at the rate of interest on the City's cash pool for the period during which the balance was held. In the event of such withdrawal, Transmission Provider, subject to the confidentiality provisions of Section 13.1, shall provide, at Interconnection Customer's request, all information that Transmission Provider developed for any completed study conducted up to the date of withdrawal of the Interconnection Request.

 Section 4. Queue Position

 4.1 General.

 Transmission Provider shall assign a Queue Position based upon the date and time of receipt of the valid Interconnection Request; provided that, if the sole reason an Interconnection Request is not valid is the lack of required information on the application form, and Interconnection Customer provides such information in accordance with Section 3.3.3, then Transmission Provider shall assign Interconnection Customer a Queue Position based on the date the application form was originally filed. Moving a Point of Interconnection shall result in a lowering of Queue Position if it is deemed a Material Modification under Section 4.4.3.

 The Queue Position of each Interconnection Request will be used to determine the order of performing the Interconnection Studies and determination of cost responsibility for the facilities necessary to accommodate the Interconnection Request. A higher queued Interconnection Request is one that has been placed "earlier" in the queue in relation to another Interconnection Request that is lower queued.

 Transmission Provider may allocate the cost of the common upgrades for clustered Interconnection Requests without regard to Queue Position.

 4.2 Clustering.

 At Transmission Provider's option, Interconnection Requests may be studied serially or in clusters for the purpose of the Interconnection System Impact Study.

 Clustering shall be implemented on the basis of Queue Position. If Transmission Provider elects to study Interconnection Requests using Clustering, all Interconnection Requests received within a period not to exceed one hundred and eighty (180) Calendar Days, hereinafter referred to as the "Queue Cluster Window" shall be studied together without regard to the nature of the underlying Interconnection Service, whether Energy Resource Interconnection Service or Network Resource Interconnection Service. The deadline for completing all Interconnection System Impact Studies for which an Interconnection System Impact Study Agreement has been executed during a Queue Cluster Window shall be in accordance with Section 7.4, for all Interconnection Requests assigned to the same Queue Cluster Window. Transmission Provider may study an Interconnection Request separately to the extent warranted by Good Utility Practice based upon the electrical remoteness of the proposed Large Generating Facility.

 Clustering Interconnection System Impact Studies shall be conducted in such a manner to ensure the efficient implementation of the applicable regional transmission expansion plan in light of the Transmission System's capabilities at the time of each study.

 The Queue Cluster Window shall have a fixed time interval based on fixed annual opening and closing dates. Any changes to the established Queue Cluster Window interval and opening or closing dates shall be announced with a posting on Transmission Provider's OASIS beginning at least one hundred and eighty (180) Calendar Days in advance of the change and continuing thereafter through the end date of the first Queue Cluster Window that is to be modified.

 4.3 Transferability of Queue Position.

 An Interconnection Customer may transfer its Queue Position to another entity only if such entity acquires the specific Generating Facility identified in the Interconnection Request and the Point of Interconnection does not change.

 4.4 Modifications.

 Interconnection Customer shall submit to Transmission Provider, in writing, modifications to any information provided in the Interconnection Request. Interconnection Customer shall retain its Queue Position if the modifications are in accordance with Sections 4.4.1, 4.4.2 or 4.4.5, or are determined not to be Material Modifications pursuant to Section 4.4.3.

 Notwithstanding the above, during the course of the Interconnection Studies, either Interconnection Customer or Transmission Provider may identify changes to the planned interconnection that may improve the costs and benefits (including reliability) of the interconnection, and the ability of the proposed change to accommodate the Interconnection Request. To the extent the identified changes are acceptable to Transmission Provider and Interconnection Customer, such acceptance not to be unreasonably withheld, Transmission Provider shall modify the Point of Interconnection and/or configuration in accordance with such changes and proceed with any re-studies necessary to do so in accordance with Section 6.4, Section 7.6 and Section 8.5 as applicable and Interconnection Customer shall retain its Queue Position.

 4.4.1 Prior to the return of the executed Interconnection System Impact Study Agreement to Transmission Provider, modifications permitted under this Section shall include specifically: (a) a decrease of up to 60 percent of electrical output (MW) of the proposed project; (b) modifying the technical parameters associated with the Large Generating Facility technology or the Large Generating Facility step-up transformer impedance characteristics; and (c) modifying the interconnection configuration. For plant increases, the incremental increase in plant output will go to the end of the queue for the purposes of cost allocation and study analysis.

 4.4.2 Prior to the return of the executed Interconnection Facility Study Agreement to Transmission Provider, the modifications permitted under this Section shall include specifically: (a) additional 15 percent decrease of electrical output (MW), and (b) Large Generating Facility technical parameters associated with modifications to Large Generating Facility technology and transformer impedances; provided, however, the incremental costs associated with those modifications are the responsibility of the requesting Interconnection Customer.

 4.4.3 Prior to making any modification other than those specifically permitted by Sections 4.4.1, 4.4.2, and 4.4.5, Interconnection Customer may first request that Transmission Provider evaluate whether such modification is a Material Modification. In response to Interconnection Customer's request, Transmission Provider shall evaluate the proposed modifications prior to making them and inform Interconnection Customer in writing of whether the modifications would constitute a Material Modification. Any change to the Point of Interconnection, except those deemed acceptable under Sections 4.4.1, 6.1, 7.2 or so allowed elsewhere, shall constitute a Material Modification. Interconnection Customer may then withdraw the proposed modification or proceed with a new Interconnection Request for such modification.

 4.4.4 Upon receipt of Interconnection Customer's request for modification permitted under this Section 4.4, Transmission Provider shall commence and perform any necessary additional studies as soon as practicable, but in no event shall Transmission Provider commence such studies later than thirty (30) Calendar Days after receiving

 notice of Interconnection Customer's request. Any additional studies resulting from such modification shall be done at Interconnection Customer's cost.

 4.4.5 Extensions of less than three (3) cumulative years in the Commercial Operation Date of the Large Generating Facility to which the Interconnection Request relates are not material and should be handled through construction sequencing.

 Section 5. Procedures for Interconnection Requests Submitted Prior to Effective Date of Standard Large Generator Interconnection Procedures

 Article 3. Reserved

 Article 4. Scope of Service

 4.1 Interconnection Product Options. Interconnection Customer has selected the following (checked) type of Interconnection Service:

 4.1.1 Energy Resource Interconnection Service.

 4.1.1.1 The Product. Energy Resource Interconnection Service allows Interconnection Customer to connect the Large Generating Facility to the Transmission System and be eligible to deliver the Large Generating Facility's output using the existing firm or non-firm capacity of the Transmission System on an "as available" basis. To the extent Interconnection Customer wants to receive Energy Resource Interconnection Service, Transmission Provider shall construct facilities identified in Attachment A.

 4.1.1.2 Transmission Delivery Service Implications. Under Energy Resource Interconnection Service, Interconnection Customer will be eligible to inject power from the Large Generating Facility into and deliver power across the interconnecting Transmission Provider's Transmission System on an "as available" basis up to the amount of MWs identified in the applicable stability and steady state studies to the extent the upgrades initially required to qualify for Energy Resource Interconnection Service have been constructed. Interconnection Customer may obtain Point-to-Point Transmission Service, Network Integration Transmission Service, or be used for secondary network transmission service, pursuant to Transmission Provider's Tariff, up to the maximum output identified in the stability and steady state studies. In those instances, in order for Interconnection Customer to obtain the right to deliver or inject energy beyond the Large Generating Facility Point of Interconnection or to improve its ability to do so, transmission delivery service must be obtained pursuant to the provisions of Transmission Provider's Tariff. The Interconnection Customer's ability to inject its Large Generating Facility output beyond the Point of Interconnection, therefore, will depend on the existing capacity of Transmission Provider's Transmission System at such time as a transmission service request is made that would accommodate such delivery. The provision of firm Point-to- Point Transmission Service or Network Integration Transmission Service may require the construction of additional Network Upgrades.

 4.1.2 Network Resource Interconnection Service.

 4.1.2.1 The Product. Transmission Provider must conduct the necessary studies and construct the Network Upgrades needed to integrate the Large Generating Facility in a manner comparable to that in which Transmission Provider integrates its generating facilities to serve native load customers. To the extent Interconnection Customer wants to receive Network Resource Interconnection Service, Transmission Provider shall construct the facilities identified in Appendix A to this LGIA.

 4.1.2.2 Transmission Delivery Service Implications. Network Resource Interconnection Service allows Interconnection Customer's Large Generating Facility to be designated by any Network Customer under the Tariff on Transmission Provider's Transmission System as a Network Resource, up to the Large Generating Facility's full output, on the same basis as existing Network Resources interconnected to Transmission Provider's Transmission System, and to be studied as a Network Resource on the assumption that such a designation will occur. Although Network Resource Interconnection Service does not convey a reservation of transmission service, any Network Customer under the Tariff can utilize its network service under the Tariff to obtain delivery of energy from the interconnected Interconnection Customer's Large Generating Facility in the same manner as it accesses other Network Resources. A Large Generating Facility receiving Network Resource Interconnection Service may also be used to provide Ancillary Services after technical studies and/or periodic analyses are performed with respect to the Large Generating Facility's ability to provide any applicable Ancillary Services, provided that such studies and analyses have been or would be required in connection with the provision of such Ancillary Services by any existing Network Resource. However, if an Interconnection Customer's Large Generating Facility has not been designated as a Network Resource by any load, it cannot be required to provide Ancillary Services except to the extent such requirements extend to all generating facilities that are similarly situated. The provision of Network Integration Transmission Service or firm Point-to-Point Transmission Service may require additional studies and the construction of additional upgrades. Because such studies and upgrades would be associated with a request for delivery service under the Tariff, cost responsibility for the studies and upgrades would be in accordance with the provision of transmission delivery service under the Tariff.

 Network Resource Interconnection Service does not necessarily provide Interconnection Customer with the capability to physically deliver the output of its Large Generating Facility to any particular load on Transmission Provider's Transmission System without incurring congestion costs. In the event of transmission constraints on Transmission Provider's Transmission System, Interconnection Customer's Large Generating Facility shall be subject to the applicable congestion management procedures in Transmission Provider's Transmission System in the same manner as all other Network Resources.

 There is no requirement either at the time of study or interconnection, or at any point in the future, that Interconnection Customer's Large Generating Facility be designated as a Network Resource by a Network Service Customer under the Tariff or that Interconnection Customer identify a specific buyer (or sink). To the extent a Network Customer does designate the Large Generating Facility as a Network Resource, it must do so pursuant to Transmission Provider's Tariff.

 Once an Interconnection Customer satisfies the requirements for obtaining Network Resource Interconnection Service, any future transmission service request for delivery from the Large Generating Facility within Transmission Provider's Transmission System of any amount of capacity and/or energy, up to the amount initially studied, will not require that any additional studies be performed or that any further upgrades associated with such Large Generating Facility be undertaken, regardless of whether or not such Large Generating Facility is ever designated by a Network Customer as a Network Resource and regardless of changes in ownership of the Large Generating Facility. However, the reduction or elimination of congestion or redispatch costs may require additional studies and the construction of additional upgrades.

 To the extent Interconnection Customer enters into an arrangement for long term transmission service for deliveries from the Large Generating Facility outside Transmission Provider's Transmission System, such request may require additional studies and upgrades in order for Transmission Provider to grant such request.

 4.2 Provision of Service. Transmission Provider shall provide Interconnection Service for the Large Generating Facility at the Point of Interconnection.

 4.3 Performance Standards. Each Party shall perform all of its obligations under this LGIA in accordance with Applicable Laws and Regulations, Applicable Reliability Standards, and Good Utility Practice, and to the extent a Party is required or prevented or limited in taking any action by such regulations and standards, such Party shall not be deemed to be in Breach of this LGIA for its compliance therewith.

 4.4 No Transmission Delivery Service. The execution of this LGIA does not constitute a request for, nor the provision of, any transmission delivery service under Transmission Provider's Tariff, and does not convey any right to deliver electricity to any specific customer or Point of Delivery.

 4.5 Interconnection Customer Provided Services. The services provided by Interconnection Customer under this LGIA are set forth in Article 9.6 and Article 13.5.1. Interconnection Customer shall be paid for such services in accordance with Article 11.6.

 Article 5. Interconnection Facilities Engineering, Procurement, and Construction

 5.1 Options. Unless otherwise mutually agreed to between the Parties, Interconnection Customer shall select the In-Service Date, Initial Synchronization Date, and Commercial Operation Date; and either Standard Option or Alternate Option set forth below for completion of Transmission Provider's Interconnection Facilities and Network Upgrades as set forth in Appendix A, Interconnection Facilities and Network Upgrades, and such dates and selected option shall be set forth in Appendix B, Milestones.

 5.1.1 Standard Option. Transmission Provider shall design, procure, and construct Transmission Provider's Interconnection Facilities and Network Upgrades, using Reasonable Efforts to complete Transmission Provider's Interconnection Facilities and Network Upgrades by the dates set forth in Appendix B, Milestones. Transmission Provider shall not be required to undertake any action which is inconsistent with its standard safety practices, its material and equipment specifications, its design criteria and construction procedures, its labor agreements, and Applicable Laws and Regulations. In the event Transmission Provider reasonably expects that it will not be able to complete Transmission Provider's Interconnection Facilities and Network Upgrades by the specified dates, Transmission Provider shall promptly provide written notice to Interconnection Customer and shall undertake Reasonable Efforts to meet the earliest dates thereafter.

 5.1.2 Alternate Option. If the dates designated by Interconnection Customer are acceptable to Transmission Provider, Transmission Provider shall so notify Interconnection Customer within thirty (30) Calendar Days, and shall assume responsibility for the design, procurement and construction of Transmission Provider's Interconnection Facilities by the designated dates.

 If Transmission Provider subsequently fails to complete Transmission Provider's Interconnection Facilities by the In-Service Date, to the extent necessary to provide back feed power; or fails to complete Network Upgrades by the Initial Synchronization Date to the extent necessary to allow for Trial Operation at full power output, unless other arrangements are made by the Parties for such Trial Operation; or fails to complete the Network Upgrades by the Commercial Operation Date, as such dates are reflected in Appendix B, Milestones; Transmission Provider shall pay Interconnection Customer liquidated damages in accordance with Article 5.3, Liquidated Damages, provided, however, the dates designated by Interconnection Customer shall be extended day for day for each day that the BPA refuses to grant clearances to install equipment.

 18.3.5 The Interconnection Customer's Commercial General Liability Insurance, Comprehensive Automobile Insurance and Excess Public Liability Insurance policies shall name the Transmission Provider, its parent, associated and Affiliate companies and their respective directors, officers, agents, servants and employees ("Other Party Group") as additional insured. The Interconnection Customer's policies shall contain provisions whereby the insurers waive all rights of subrogation in accordance with the provisions of this LGIA against the Other Party Group and provide thirty (30) days advance written notice to the Other Party Group prior to anniversary date of cancellation or any material change in coverage or condition.

 18.3.6 The Commercial General Liability Insurance, Comprehensive Automobile Liability Insurance and Excess Public Liability Insurance policies shall contain provisions that specify that the polices are primary and shall apply to such extent without consideration for other policies separately carried and shall state that each insured is provided coverage as though a separate policy had been issues to each, except the insurer's liability shall not be increased beyond the amount for which the insurer would have been liable had only one insured been covered. Each Party shall be responsible for its respective deductibles or retentions.

 18.3.7 The Commercial General Liability Insurance, Comprehensive Automobile Liability Insurance and Excess Public Liability Insurance policies, if written on a Claims First Made Basis, shall be maintained in full force and effect for two (2) years after termination of this LGIA, which coverage may be in the form of tail coverage or extended reporting period coverage if agreed by the Parties.

 18.3.8 The requirements contained herein as to the types and limits of all insurance to be maintained by the Parties are not intended to and shall not in any manner, limit or qualify the liabilities and obligations assumed by the Parties under this LGIA.

 18.3.9 Within ten (10) days following execution of this LGIA, and as soon as practicable after the end of each fiscal year or at the renewal of the insurance policy and in any event within ninety (90) days thereafter, each Party shall provide certification of all insurance required in this LGIA, executed by each insurer or by an authorized representative of each insurer.

 18.3.10 Notwithstanding the foregoing, each Party may self-insure to meet the minimum insurance requirements of Articles 18.3.2 through 18.3.8 to the extent it maintains a self-insurance program; provided that, such Party's senior secured debt is rated at investment grade or better by Standard & Poor's and that its self-insurance program meets the minimum insurance requirements of Articles 18.3.2 through 18.3.8. For any period of time that a Party's senior secured debt is unrated by Standard & Poor's or is rated at less than investment grade by Standard & Poor's, such Party shall comply with the insurance requirements applicable to it under Articles 18.3.2 through 18.3.9. In the event that a Party is permitted to self-insure pursuant to this article, it shall notify the other Party that it meets the requirements to self-insure and that its self-insurance program meets the minimum insurance requirements in a manner consistent with that specified in Article 18.3.9.

 18.3.11 The Parties agree to report to each other in writing as soon as practical all accidents or occurrences resulting in injuries to any person, including death, and any property damage arising out of this LGIA.

 Article 19. Assignment

 19.1 Assignment. This LGIA may be assigned by either Party only with the written consent of the other; provided that either Party may assign this LGIA without the consent of the other Party to any Affiliate of the assigning Party with an equal or greater credit rating and with the legal authority and operational ability to satisfy the obligations of the assigning Party under this LGIA; and provided further that Interconnection Customer shall have the right to assign this LGIA, without the consent of Transmission Provider, for collateral security purposes to aid in providing financing for the Large Generating Facility, provided that Interconnection Customer will promptly notify Transmission Provider of any such assignment. Any financing arrangement entered into by Interconnection Customer pursuant to this article will provide that prior to or upon the exercise of the secured party's, trustee's or mortgagee's assignment rights pursuant to said arrangement, the secured creditor, the trustee or mortgagee will notify Transmission Provider of the date and particulars of any such exercise of assignment right(s), including providing the Transmission Provider with proof that it meets the requirements of Articles 11.5 and 18.3. Any attempted assignment that violates this article is void and ineffective. Any assignment under this LGIA shall not relieve a Party of its obligations, nor shall a Party's obligations be enlarged, in whole or in part, by reason thereof. Where required, consent to assignment will not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed.

 Article 20. Severability

 20.1 Severability. If any provision in this LGIA is finally determined to be invalid, void or unenforceable by any court or other Governmental Authority having jurisdiction, such determination shall not invalidate, void or make unenforceable any other provision, agreement or covenant of this LGIA; provided that if Interconnection Customer (or any third party, but only if such third party is not acting at the direction of Transmission Provider) seeks and obtains such a final determination with respect to any provision of the Alternate Option (Article 5.1.2), or the Negotiated Option (Article 5.1.4), then none of these provisions shall thereafter have any force or effect and the Parties' rights and obligations shall be governed solely by the Standard Option (Article 5.1.1).

 Article 21. Comparability

 21.1 Comparability. The Interconnection Customer will comply with all applicable comparability and code of conduct laws, rules and regulations, as amended from time to time.

 Article 22. Confidentiality

 22.1 Confidentiality. Confidential Information shall include, without limitation, all information relating to a Party's technology, research and development, business affairs, and pricing, and any information supplied by either of the Parties to the other prior to the execution of this LGIA.

 Information is Confidential Information only if it is clearly designated or marked in writing as confidential on the face of the document, or, if the information is conveyed orally or by inspection, if the Party providing the information orally informs the Party receiving the information that the information is confidential.

 If requested by either Party, the other Party shall provide in writing, the basis for asserting that the information referred to in this Article 22 warrants confidential treatment, and the requesting Party may disclose such writing to the appropriate Governmental Authority. Each Party shall be responsible for the costs associated with affording confidential treatment to its information.

 22.1.1 Term. During the term of this LGIA, and for a period of three (3) years after the expiration or termination of this LGIA, except as otherwise provided in this Article 22, each Party shall hold in confidence and shall not disclose to any person Confidential Information.

 22.1.2 Scope. Confidential Information shall not include information that the receiving Party can demonstrate: (1) is generally available to the public other than as a result of a disclosure by the receiving Party; (2) was in the lawful possession of the receiving Party on a non- confidential basis before receiving it from the disclosing Party; (3) was supplied to the receiving Party without restriction by a third party, who, to the knowledge of the receiving Party after due inquiry, was under no obligation to the disclosing Party to keep such information confidential; (4) was independently developed by the receiving Party without reference to Confidential Information of the disclosing Party; (5) is, or becomes, publicly known, through no wrongful act or omission of the receiving Party or Breach of this LGIA; or (6) is required, in accordance with Article 22.1.7 of the LGIA, Order of Disclosure, to be disclosed by any Governmental Authority or is otherwise required to be disclosed by law or subpoena, or is necessary in any legal proceeding establishing rights and obligations under this LGIA. Information designated as Confidential Information will no longer be deemed confidential if the Party that designated the information as confidential notifies the other Party that it no longer is confidential.

 22.1.3 Release of Confidential Information. Neither Party shall release or disclose Confidential Information to any other person, except to its Affiliates (limited by the Standards of Conduct requirements), subcontractors, employees, consultants, or to parties who may be or considering providing financing to or equity participation with Interconnection Customer, or to potential purchasers or assignees of Interconnection Customer, on a need-to-know basis in connection with this LGIA, unless such person has first been advised of the confidentiality provisions of this Article 22 and has agreed to comply with such provisions, or unless required by law. Notwithstanding the foregoing, a Party providing Confidential Information to any person shall remain primarily responsible for any release of Confidential Information in contravention of this Article 22.

 22.1.4 Rights. Each Party retains all rights, title, and interest in the Confidential Information that each Party discloses to the other Party. The disclosure by each Party to the other Party of Confidential Information shall not be deemed a waiver by either Party or any other person or entity of the right to protect the Confidential Information from public disclosure.

 22.1.5 No Warranties. By providing Confidential Information, neither Party makes any warranties or representations as to its accuracy or completeness. In addition, by supplying Confidential Information, neither Party obligates itself to provide any particular information or Confidential Information to the other Party nor to enter into any further agreements or proceed with any other relationship or joint venture.

 22.1.6 Standard of Care. Each Party shall use at least the same standard of care to protect Confidential Information it receives as it uses to protect its own Confidential Information from unauthorized disclosure, publication or dissemination. Each Party may use Confidential Information solely to fulfill its obligations to the other Party under this LGIA or its regulatory requirements.

 22.1.7 Order of Disclosure. If a court or a Government Authority or entity with the right, power, and apparent authority to do so requests or requires either Party, by subpoena, oral deposition, interrogatories, requests for production of documents, administrative order, or otherwise, to disclose Confidential Information, that Party shall provide the other Party with prompt notice of such request(s) or requirement(s) so that the other Party may seek an appropriate protective order or waive compliance with the terms of this LGIA. Notwithstanding the absence of a protective order or waiver, the Party may disclose such Confidential Information which, in the opinion of its counsel, the Party is legally compelled to disclose.

 22.1.8 Termination of Agreement. Upon termination of this LGIA for any reason, each Party shall, within ten (10) Calendar Days of receipt of a written request from the other Party, use Reasonable Efforts to destroy, erase, or delete (with such destruction, erasure, and deletion certified in writing to the other Party) or return to the other Party, without retaining copies thereof, any and all written or electronic Confidential Information received from the other Party.

 22.1.9 Remedies. The Parties agree that monetary damages would be inadequate to compensate a Party for the other Party's Breach of its obligations under this Article 22. Each Party accordingly agrees that the other Party shall be entitled to equitable relief, by way of injunction or otherwise, if the first Party Breaches or threatens to Breach its obligations under this Article 22, which equitable relief shall be granted without bond or proof of damages, and the receiving Party shall not plead in defense that there would be an adequate remedy at law. Such remedy shall not be deemed an exclusive remedy for the Breach of this Article 22, but shall be in addition to all other remedies available at law or in equity. The Parties further acknowledge and agree that the covenants contained herein are necessary for the protection of legitimate business interests and are reasonable in scope. No Party, however, shall be liable for indirect, incidental, or consequential or punitive damages of any nature or kind resulting from or arising in connection with this Article 22.

 22.1.10 Disclosure to FERC, its Staff, or a State. Notwithstanding anything in this Article 22 to the contrary, and pursuant to 18 CFR section 1b.20, if FERC or its staff, during the course of an investigation or otherwise, requests information from one of the Parties that is otherwise required to be maintained in confidence pursuant to this LGIA, the Party shall provide the requested information to FERC or its staff, within the time provided for in the request for information. In providing the information to FERC or its staff, the Party may, consistent with 18 CFR section 388.112, request that the information be treated as confidential and non-public by FERC and its staff and that the information be withheld from public disclosure. Parties are prohibited from notifying the other Party to this LGIA prior to the release of the Confidential Information to FERC or its staff. The Party shall notify the other Party to the LGIA when it is notified by FERC or its staff that a request to release Confidential Information has been received by FERC, at which time either of the Parties may respond before such information would be made public, pursuant to 18 CFR section 388.112. Requests from a state regulatory body conducting a confidential investigation shall be treated in a similar manner if consistent with the applicable state rules and regulations.

 22.1.11 Subject to the exception in Article 22.1.10, any information that a Party claims is competitively sensitive, commercial or financial information under this LGIA ("Confidential Information") shall not be disclosed by the other Party to any person not employed or retained by the other Party, except to the extent disclosure is (i) required by law; (ii) reasonably deemed by the disclosing Party to be required to be disclosed in connection with a dispute between or among the Parties, or the defense of litigation or dispute; (iii) otherwise permitted by consent of the other Party, such consent not to be unreasonably withheld; or (iv) necessary to fulfill its obligations under this LGIA or as a transmission service provider or a Control Area operator including disclosing the Confidential Information to BPA or to a regional or national reliability organization. The Party asserting confidentiality shall notify the other Party in writing of the information it claims is confidential. Prior to any disclosures of the other Party's Confidential Information under this subparagraph, or if any third party or Governmental Authority makes any request or demand for any of the information described in this subparagraph, the disclosing Party agrees to promptly notify the other Party in writing and agrees to assert confidentiality and cooperate with the other Party in seeking to protect the Confidential Information from public disclosure by confidentiality agreement, protective order or other reasonable measures.

The Parties agree to cooperate with each other and provide necessary information regarding such inability to comply, including the date, duration, reason for the inability to comply, and corrective actions taken or planned to be taken with respect to such inability to comply. Notwithstanding the foregoing, notification, cooperation or information provided under this article shall not entitle the Party receiving such notification to allege a cause for anticipatory breach of this LGIA.

 25.3 Audit Rights. Subject to the requirements of confidentiality under Article 22 of this LGIA, each Party shall have the right, during normal business hours, and upon prior reasonable notice to the other Party, to audit at its own expense the other Party's accounts and records pertaining to either Party's performance or either Party's satisfaction of obligations under this LGIA. Such audit rights shall include audits of the other Party's costs, calculation of invoiced amounts, Transmission Provider's efforts to allocate responsibility for the provision of reactive support to the Transmission System, Transmission Provider's efforts to allocate responsibility for interruption or reduction of generation on the Transmission System, and each Party's actions in an Emergency Condition. Any audit authorized by this article shall be performed at the offices where such accounts and records are maintained and shall be limited to those portions of such accounts and records that relate to each Party's performance and satisfaction of obligations under this LGIA. Each Party shall keep such accounts and records for a period equivalent to the audit rights periods described in Article 25.4.

 Article 26. Subcontractors

 26.1 General. Nothing in this LGIA shall prevent a Party from utilizing the services of any subcontractor as it deems appropriate to perform its obligations under this LGIA; provided, however, that each Party shall require its subcontractors to comply with all applicable terms and conditions of this LGIA in providing such services and each Party shall remain primarily liable to the other Party for the performance of such subcontractor.

 26.2 Responsibility of Principal. The creation of any subcontract relationship shall not relieve the hiring Party of any of its obligations under this LGIA. The hiring Party shall be fully responsible to the other Party for the acts or omissions of any subcontractor the hiring Party hires as if no subcontract had been made; provided, however, that in no event shall Transmission Provider be liable for the actions or inactions of Interconnection Customer or its subcontractors with respect to obligations of Interconnection Customer under Article 5 of this LGIA. Any applicable obligation imposed by this LGIA upon the hiring Party shall be equally binding upon, and shall be construed as having application to, any subcontractor of such Party.

 Article 27. Disputes

 27.1 Submission. In the event either Party has a dispute, or asserts a claim, that arises out of or in connection with this LGIA or its performance, such Party (the "disputing Party") shall provide the other Party with written notice of the dispute or claim ("Notice of Dispute"). Such dispute or claim shall be referred to a designated senior representative of each Party for resolution on an informal basis as promptly as practicable after receipt of the Notice of Dispute by the other Party. In the event the designated representatives are unable to resolve the claim or dispute through unassisted or assisted negotiations within thirty (30) Calendar Days of the other Party's receipt of the Notice of Dispute, such claim or dispute may, upon mutual agreement of the Parties, be submitted to arbitration and resolved in accordance with the arbitration procedures set forth below. In the event the Parties do not agree to submit such claim or dispute to arbitration, each Party may exercise whatever rights and remedies it may have in equity or at law consistent with the terms of this LGIA.

Unless otherwise agreed by the Parties, the arbitrator(s) shall render a decision within ninety (90) Calendar Days of appointment and shall notify the Parties in writing of such decision and the reasons therefor. The arbitrator(s) shall be authorized only to interpret and apply the provisions of this LGIA and shall have no power to modify or change any provision of this Agreement in any manner. The decision of the arbitrator(s) shall be final and binding upon the Parties, and judgment on the award may be entered in any court having jurisdiction. The decision of the arbitrator(s) may be appealed solely on the grounds that the conduct of the arbitrator(s), or the decision itself, violated the standards set forth in the Federal Arbitration Act or the Administrative Dispute Resolution Act. Substantive standards for the resolution of disputes resolved hereunder shall reflect FERC regulations and precedent as well as applicable legal precedent.

 27.4 Costs.
