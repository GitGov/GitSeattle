 Section 1. The permission granted to Clise Properties, Inc. to maintain and operate a utility tunnel under the alley between 5th Avenue and 6th Avenue, north of Virginia Street, including all rights, title and interests as conferred by Ordinance 119437 and amended by Ordinance 121855, is transferred to 2001 Sixth L.L.C. (Permittee) and its successors and assigns. 2001 Sixth L.L.C. shall assume all of the responsibilities and duties of the Permittee under Ordinance 119437, as amended by Ordinance 121855, and as amended by this ordinance. The permission (also referred to in this ordinance as a permit) is renewed for a ten-year period starting June 3, 2009 and ending at 11:59 p.m. on June 2, 2019 upon the terms and conditions set forth in Ordinance 119437, as amended by Ordinance 121855, and as further amended by this ordinance.

 Section 2. Sections 2, 3, 4, 7, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, and 14 of Ordinance 119437, as amended by Ordinance 121855, are amended as follows:

The Permittee shall submit a complete application for a new term permit ordinance no later than 180 days prior to the expiration of the ordinance term. Failure to obtain additional permission through a new tunnel ordinance, or to remove the tunnel prior to expiration of the term, is a violation of Chapter 15.90 of the Seattle Municipal Code (SMC).

The ((~~permit~~))  permission  granted ((~~hereby~~)) is subject to ((~~primary and secondary~~)) use  of the street right-of-way  by the  City and the  public for travel ,  ((~~and~~)) utility purposes, and  other street uses.  ((~~t~~)) T he City expressly reserves the right to require the Permittee to remove the tunnel , or any part thereof or installation thereon, and return the street right-of-way to the condition that existed prior to construction of the utility tunnel at  the Permittee's sole cost and expense in the event that:

 (a) The City Council determines((~~,~~)) by ordinance((~~,~~)) that the space occupied by the tunnel is necessary for any ((~~primary or secondary~~)) public use or benefit((~~,~~)) or that the tunnel interferes with any ((~~primary or secondary~~)) public use or benefit; or

 (b) The Director ((~~of Transportation ("Director")~~)) determines that any term or condition of this ordinance has been violated((~~,~~)) and ((~~such~~))  the violation ((~~is~~))  has not  been  corrected by the Permittee ((~~with thirty (30) days of~~))  by the compliance date after written notification from the City.

Coverage shall contain a Separation of Insureds Clause indicating essentially that "except with respect to the limits of insurance, and any rights or duties specifically assigned in this coverage part to the first named insured, this insurance applies as if each named insured were the only named insured, and separately to each insured against whom claim is made or suit is brought". Evidence of current coverage shall be submitted to the City in the form of a copy of the full insurance policy with all endorsements attached thereto, and is a condition to the validity of this permit.~~))
