 ORDINANCE _________________

 AN ORDINANCE relating to the 2008 Budget; recognizing the carry forward of certain unexpended capital appropriations from the 2007 budget; appropriating unexpended funds for non-capital purposes from the 2007 budget of various departments; and imposing budget provisos; all by a three-fourths vote of the City Council.

 WHEREAS, RCW 35.32A.080 provides that unexpended and unencumbered appropriations for capital purposes automatically carry forward from each budget year to the next unless abandoned by ordinance; and

 WHEREAS, appropriations for the City's Capital Improvement Program (CIP) are readily identifiable as being capital in nature and therefore automatically carry forward without Council action; and

 WHEREAS, the City appropriates funds for capital purposes that are not readily identifiable as capital appropriations because they are not tied to a CIP project; and

 WHEREAS, it was, and is, the Executive's and City Council's intent that those capital appropriations are carried forward in accordance with RCW 35.32A.080; and

 WHEREAS, certain City departments and agencies have unexpended 2007 non-capital appropriations that the Executive and City Council wish to appropriate for 2008, but which were not included in the 2008 Adopted Budget; NOW, THEREFORE,

 BE IT ORDAINED BY THE CITY OF SEATTLE AS FOLLOWS:

Those appropriations are automatically carried forward to the 2008 budget for the same capital purposes for which they were intended, in accordance with RCW 35.32A.080.
