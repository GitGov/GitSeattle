 AN ORDINANCE relating to local economic stimulus efforts; amending the 2009 Adopted Budget and increasing an appropriation; revising project allocations and spending plans in the 2009-2014 Capital Improvement Program for certain projects; and amending a budget proviso; all by a three-fourths vote of the City Council.

 WHEREAS, the United States of America is experiencing one of the worst financial crises since the Great Depression of the 1930s; and

 WHEREAS, the current economic downturn has resulted in federal, state, county, and local governments experiencing significant losses in revenue, while demand for services continues to increase; and

 WHEREAS, to immediately create jobs and boost Seattle's economy in 2009 and 2010, the Mayor and the City Council want to accelerate certain capital projects; and

 WHEREAS, many of the proposed projects were originally slated for completion over the next several years, but can be accelerated without raising taxes and fees; and

 WHEREAS, to accomplish the scope of work on these projects in 2009, adjustments must be made to Seattle's current year budget and Capital Improvement Program; and

 WHEREAS, accelerating these projects will help jumpstart our local economy and provide much-needed jobs and support to Seattle's residents and businesses in these uniquely difficult economic times; and

 WHEREAS, in adopting the 2009 budget, the City Council approved Green Sheet 3-1-A-1, thereby imposing a budget proviso restricting expenditure of the money appropriated in Seattle City Light's 2009 Adopted Budget for pre-design or design work related to the North Downtown Substation Development project until authorized by a future ordinance; and

 WHEREAS, a portion of the North Downtown Substation Development project is included as an accelerated project, and the Council wishes to amend its proviso on work related to environmental remediation at the future Substation site; NOW, THEREFORE,

 BE IT ORDAINED BY THE CITY OF SEATTLE AS FOLLOWS:
