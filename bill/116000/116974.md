</table> Project Descriptions :

 315444 Urban Village Park (Crown Hill)

 This is a passive park in the Crown Hill neighborhood located on Northwest 90th Street and 15th Avenue Northwest. The property was acquired from the Seattle School District in 2009, which determined that the site was surplus to the needs of the District.

 315445 Northgate Park (Hubbard Homestead Park)

 This 3.73 acre project is a passive open space in the Northgate neighborhood of Seattle. The site, a former Park and Ride lot that was moved to another location, was acquired in 2009. The site is in a densely populated neighborhood and will help provide much needed open space in an underserved area as it continues to grow.

 315446 Webster Park

 This 0.8 acre open space acquisition project, on the site of the former Webster Elementary School in the Ballard neighborhood, was acquired from the Seattle School District in 2009. The project provides passive open space in a neighborhood underserved with open space.
