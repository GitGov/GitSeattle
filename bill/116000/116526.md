 b. the solicitation is part of a general solicitation made at a gathering that may include, but does not target, City employees;

 c. the solicitation is made to a City employee who, subsequent to the effective date of this ordinance, makes an unsolicited contribution to the elected official or candidate for public office, political party, or political committee making the solicitation;

 d. the solicitation is made to a City employee who expressly requests to be added to a mailing list from the elected official or candidate for public office, political party, or political committee; and
