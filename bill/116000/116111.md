 WHEREAS, urban centers and hub urban villages have become increasingly characterized by mixed use development with residential uses in close proximity to commercial and entertainment uses; and

 B. It is an affirmative defense to any proceeding arising under this section that the receiving dwelling unit was unoccupied at the time of the violation.

 C. The Administrator shall promulgate by rule a standard for amplified noise plainly audible to a person of normal hearing which can be measured using a sound level meter.

 Section 4. A new Section 25.08.890 of the Seattle Municipal Code is adopted to read as follows:

 25.08.890 Warning for Nightlife disturbance violations

 If after investigation the Administrator determines that the provisions of Section 25.08.501 have been violated, the Administrator may issue a citation, but only if a written warning has been issued to the person by the City within the previous three hundred and sixty five (365) days. A warning shall be served upon the persons responsible for the condition or violation by personal service or by first class mail, addressed to the person's last known address. If the address of the responsible person is unknown and cannot be found after a reasonable search, the warning may be served by posting a copy at a conspicuous place on the property where the violation occurred. If a warning is directed to a person responsible for the violation who is not the owner of the property where the violation is occurring, a copy of the warning may be sent to the owner of the property.

 B. Service. The citation may be served by personal service in the manner set forth in RCW 4.28.080 for service of a summons or sent by first class mail, addressed to the last known address of such person(s). Service shall be complete at the time of personal service, or if mailed, on the date of mailing. If a citation sent by first class mail is returned as undeliverable, service may be made by posting the citation at a conspicuous place on the property on which the violation occurred.

 Section 6. A new section 25.08.910 of the Seattle Municipal Code is adopted to read as follows:

 25.08.910 Response to citations.

 A. A person must respond to a citation in one (1) of the following ways:

 2. Requesting in writing a mitigation hearing to explain the circumstances surrounding the commission of the violation and providing a mailing address to which notice of such hearing may be sent; or

 3. Requesting a contested hearing in writing, specifying the reason why the cited violation did not occur or why the person cited is not responsible for the violation, and providing a mailing address to which notice of such hearing may be sent.

 B. A response to a citation must be received by the Office of the Hearing Examiner no later than fifteen (15) days after the date the citation is served. When the last day of the appeal period so computed is a Saturday, Sunday, or federal or City holiday, the period shall run until five p.m. on the next business day.

 Section 7. A new section 25.08.915 of the Seattle Municipal Code, is adopted to read as follows:

 25.08.915 Voluntary mitigation and waiver of initial penalty for nightlife disturbance violations

 For violations of Section 25.08.501 only, the Administrator may waive the penalty for the first violation if, within fifteen (15) days of the date of the citation, the respondent admits liability for the violation and elects, in a manner prescribed by rule[A2], to provide permanent improvements or modifications that are reasonably likely to prevent future violations, which may include, but not be limited to, installation of sound insulation, isolators, suspension mounting or other sound mitigating measures. To be eligible for waiver, these improvements must be installed and approved by the Administrator within ninety (90) days of the citation.

 Section 8. A new section 25.08.920 of the Seattle Municipal Code, is adopted to read as follows:

The person cited may present witnesses, but witnesses may not be compelled to attend. A representative of the Administrator may also be present and may present additional information, but attendance by a representative of the Administrator is not required.

 C. Disposition. The Hearing Examiner shall determine whether the person's explanation justifies reduction of the monetary penalty; however, the monetary penalty may not be reduced unless the Administrator affirms or certifies that the violation has been corrected prior to the mitigation hearing. Factors that may be considered in whether to reduce the penalty include whether the violation was caused by the act or neglect of another; or whether correction of the violation was commenced promptly prior to citation but that full compliance was prevented by a condition or circumstance beyond the control of the person cited.

 D. Entry of Order. After hearing the explanation of the person cited and any other information presented at the hearing, the Hearing Examiner shall enter an order finding that the person cited committed the violation and assessing a monetary penalty in an amount determined pursuant to this section. The Hearing Examiner's decision is the final decision of the City on this matter.

 B. Hearing. Contested case hearings shall be conducted pursuant to the procedures for hearing contested cases contained in Section 3.02.090 and the rules adopted by the Hearing Examiner for hearing contested cases, except as modified by this section. The issues heard at the hearing shall be limited to those raised in writing in the response to the citation and that are within the jurisdiction of the Hearing Examiner. The Hearing Examiner may issue subpoenas for the attendance of witnesses and the production of documents.

 C. Sufficiency. No citation shall be deemed insufficient for failure to contain a detailed statement of the facts constituting the specific violation which the person cited is alleged to have committed or by reason of defects or imperfections, provided such lack of detail, or defects or imperfections do not prejudice substantial rights of the person cited.

 D. Amendment of Citation. A citation may be amended prior to the conclusion of the hearing to conform to the evidence presented if substantial rights of the person cited are not thereby prejudiced.

 E. Evidence at Hearing. The certified statement or declaration authorized by RCW 9A.72.085 submitted by a representative of the Administrator shall be prima facie evidence that a violation occurred and that the person cited is responsible. Any certifications or declarations authorized under RCW 9A.72.085 shall be admissible without further evidentiary foundation. The person cited may rebut the evidence and establish that the cited violation(s) did not occur or that the person contesting the citation is not responsible for the violation.

 F. Disposition. If the citation is sustained at the hearing, the Hearing Examiner shall enter an order finding that the person cited committed the violation and shall impose the applicable penalty. If the Hearing Examiner determines that the violation did not occur, the Hearing Examiner shall enter an order dismissing the citation.

 G. Appeal. The Hearing Examiner's decision is the final decision of the City. Any judicial review must be commenced within twenty-one (21) days of issuance of the Hearing Examiner's decision in accordance with RCW 36.70C.040.

 Section 11. A new Section 25.08.950 of the Seattle Municipal Code, is adopted to read as follows:

 25.08.950 Failure to appear for hearing.

For good cause shown and upon terms the Hearing Examiner deems just, the Hearing Examiner may set aside an order entered upon a failure to appear.

 Section 12. A new Section 25.08.960 of the Seattle Municipal Code, is adopted to read as follows:

 Section 13. A new Section 25.08.970 of the Seattle Municipal Code, is adopted read as follows:

 25.08.970 Each day a separate violation.

 Each day a person violates or fails to comply with the provisions of this chapter for which a citation may be issued may be considered a separate violation for which a citation may be issued and for which penalties may be imposed.

 Section 14. The enforcement provisions contained in Sections 25.08.900-25.08.970 of this ordinance apply to all enforcement actions commenced on or after the effective date of this ordinance, regardless of when the violation occurred.

The rules may include different threshold levels for areas that are zoned to allow a variety of land uses in close proximity to residential uses. The rules may also include procedures for measuring sound levels to determine if a violation has occurred. These rules shall be developed in consultation with the Nightlife Advisory Board and shall be effective no later than June 1, 2008.

 Section 17. The Executive shall report to the Economic Development and Neighborhoods Committee, or its successor committee, on completed enforcement actions brought under Seattle Municipal Code Section 25.08.501, frequency of nightlife disturbance noise complaints and the effectiveness of regulations created by this Ordinance and associated rulemaking in Section 16. This reporting shall occur annually by July 1st of each year for three (3) years beginning in 2009.
