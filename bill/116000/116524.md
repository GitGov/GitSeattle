 AN ORDINANCE related to the Seattle Ethics code, amending sections 4.16.020 to state the purpose of the Ethics Code in positive terms; 4.16.030 to add new definitions and bring some City contractors under the Commission's jurisdiction; 4.16.070 to expand the list of prohibited financial interests, require disclosure of appearances of conflicts of interest, create a mechanism for waiving the bar on dealing with former employers and clients, and to make several other changes intended to clarify the Ethics Code's prohibitions; 4.16.075 to extend from one year to two the bar on assisting others in matters in which an individual subject to the Ethics Code participated while a City employee, and to limit communications on behalf of others between former employees and their employing agencies; and 4.16.090 to create a mechanism in the Ethics Code for the Commission to administratively dismiss complaints, and to clarify how hearings are scheduled.

 WHEREAS, over the past twenty years, several other cities have adopted Ethics Codes, allowing the Commission to draw on best practices from around the nation; and

 WHEREAS, the Ethics and Elections Commission determined that certain amendments to the Ethics Code can make the Code easier to understand for the public and the City employees to whom the Code applies; and

 WHEREAS, the official duties of an elected official and his or her staff members include providing constituent services on an impartial basis to people who seek assistance from their elected representatives in dealing with City departments; and

 WHEREAS, the Ethics and Elections Commission determined that taking advantage of new technologies to enhance transparency can create a better informed citizenry, and serve as an important element of an effective Ethics Code; NOW, THEREFORE,

Accordingly, it is the purpose of this chapter to establish ethical standards of conduct for all officers and employees of the City, whether elected or appointed, paid or unpaid; to set forth those acts that are incompatible with such standards; to require disclosure by such officers and employees of private financial or other interests in matters affecting the City; and to provide effective means for enforcement thereof. This chapter is not to be construed so as to impair the ability of City officers and employees to participate in ceremonial, representational, or informational functions in the pursuit of their official duties.

 B. City officers and employees will demonstrate the values of integrity in the performance of the City's business, accountability to the law and to the people we serve, stewardship of the City's resources, and independence in the performance of our jobs.

 1. Disqualification From Acting On City Business.

 a. ~~Engage or have engaged in any transaction or activity, which is, or would to a reasonable person appear to be, in conflict with or incompatible with the proper discharge of official duties, or which impairs, or would to a reasonable person appear to impair, the officer's or employee's independence of judgment or action in the performance of official duties and fail to disqualify him or herself from official action in those instances where the conflict occurs, except as permitted by Section 4.16.071;~~b. Have a financial or other private interest, direct or indirect, personally or through a member of his or her immediate family, in any matter upon which the officer or employee is required to act in the discharge of his or her official duties, and fail to disqualify himself or herself from acting or participating,

Participate in a matter in which any of the following has a financial interest, except as permitted by Section 4.16.071:  (i) the Covered Individual;

 (ii) an immediate family member of the Covered Individual;

 (iii) an individual residing with the Covered Individual;

 (iv) a person the Covered Individual serves as an officer, director, trustee, partner or employee;

 (v) a person with which the Covered Individual is seeking or has an arrangement concerning future employment.

 b. Participate in a matter in which a person that employed the Covered Individual in the preceding 12 months, or retained the Covered Individual or his or her firm or partnership in the preceding 12 months, has a financial interest; provided, however, that the Executive Director shall waive this section when:

 (i) the Covered Individual's appointing authority or the authority's designee makes a written determination that there is a compelling City need for the Covered Individual to participate in a matter involving a prior employer or client, and submits that determination with a written plan showing how the authority will safeguard the City's interests, and

 (ii) the Executive Director determines that the authority's plan is satisfactory.

 c. ~~Fail to disqualify himself or herself from acting on any transaction which involves the City and any person who is, or at any time within the preceding twelve (12) month period has been a private client of his or hers, or of his or her firm or partnership~~;

~~d. Have a financial or other private interest, direct or indirect, personally or through a member of his or her immediate family, in any contract or transaction to which the City or any City agency may be a party, and fail to disclose such interest to the appropriate City authority prior to the formation of the contract or the time the City or City agency enters into the transaction; provided, that this paragraph shall not apply to any contract awarded through the public bid process in accordance with applicable law.~~~~~~Perform any official duties when it could appear to a reasonable person, having knowledge of the relevant circumstances, that the Covered Individual's judgment is impaired because of either (1) a personal or business relationship not covered under subsection a or b above, or (2) a transaction or activity engaged in by the Covered Individual. It is an affirmative defense to a violation of this subsection c if the Covered Individual, prior to performing the official act, discloses the relationship, transaction or activity in writing to the Executive Director and the Covered Individual's appointing authority, and the appointing authority or the authority's designee either approves or does not within one week of the disclosure disqualify the Covered Individual from acting. For an elected official to receive the same protection, the official must file a disclosure with the Executive Director and the City Clerk. If a Covered Individual is charged with a violation of this subsection, and asserts as an affirmative defense that a disclosure was made, the burden of proof is on the Covered Individual to show that a proper disclosure was made and that the Covered Individual was not notified that he or she was disqualified from acting.  d. Sections 4.06.070.1.a and 1.b shall not apply if the prohibited financial interest is shared with a substantial segment of the City's population.

 c. Except in the course of official duties, assist any person in any ~~City transaction~~matter~~where such City officer or employee's assistance is, or to a reasonable person would appear to be, enhanced by that officer or employee's position with the City~~involving the Covered Individual's department; provided, ~~however~~further, that except in the course of official duties, a Covered Individual in the Mayor's office or the legislative department may not assist any person in any matter. This ~~this subsection 4.16.070 A1c~~subsection c  shall not apply to any ~~officer or employee~~Covered Individual appearing on his or her own behalf ~~or representing himself or herself as to~~on any matter, or on behalf of any business entity solely owned by the Covered Individual~~in which he or she has a proprietary interest~~, if not otherwise prohibited by ordinance;

 Section 5. Section 4.16.090, which was last amended by Ordinance 118735, is amended as follows:

 * * *

 C. Within ~~thirty (30)~~30 days after receipt of a complaint, the Executive Director shall ~~conduct a preliminary investigation to~~review the complaint to determine whether a complaint, on its face, alleges facts that, if true, would constitute a violation of Chapter 4.16. At the request of the Executive Director, the Commission may, for good cause shown, extend the time for completion of the ~~preliminary investigation~~review. If the Commission determines that the ~~preliminary investigation~~review must be completed in less than thirty ~~thirty (30)~~30 days in order to avoid prejudice or irreparable harm to the person alleged to have violated this chapter, the Commission shall order the Executive Director to complete the ~~preliminary investigation~~review in a shorter period of time, and the Executive Director shall comply.

 D. If the Executive Director determines, after investigation, that there are no reasonable grounds to believe that a violation has occurred, or determines that the violation was inadvertent and minor, the Executive Director shall dismiss the complaint. If the Executive Director does so dismiss the complaint, he or she shall do so in writing, setting forth the facts and the provisions of law upon which the dismissal is based, and shall provide a copy of the written dismissal to the complainant, to the person named in the complaint as the alleged violator and to the Commission. A complainant may appeal a dismissal under this subsection to the Commission under rules promulgated by the Commission.

E. The Executive Director may, after investigation, seek an administrative dismissal of the complaint from the Commission when he or she determines that there are reasonable grounds to believe that:  1. A violation occurred, but it was inadvertent or minor, but not both; or

 2. A violation occurred, but appropriate actions have been taken to address the allegedly unlawful conduct.

 F

. If, after investigation, the Executive Director has reason to believe that a material violation of Chapter 4.16 has occurred, the Executive Director shall initiate an enforcement proceeding by issuing to the alleged violator a charging document which includes the provisions of Chapter 4.16 allegedly violated and the conduct that constitutes the violation(s), and shall issue a copy of the charging document to the Commission~~and schedule a hearing before the Commission~~.

The Director shall schedule a hearing to commence within 60 days of the charging document. The Commission Chair may, at any time, continue the hearing to another date. No hearing shall be scheduled, however, while an Executive Director's recommendation for a settlement is awaiting action by the Commission.

~~F~~G. ~~The Commission shall commence a hearing within thirty (30) days from the date that the Executive Director schedules the hearing.~~ The Commission shall issue a written determination stating whether the chapter has been violated and setting forth the facts and the provisions of law upon which this determination is based. A copy of said determination shall be delivered to the complainant, if any, to the person charged with the violation and, where appropriate, to the person's superior.

~~G~~H. All hearings hereunder shall be conducted as "contested case" hearings under the Administrative Code, Seattle Municipal Code Chapter 3.02 (Ordinance 102228) and the Commission's rules and regulations.

Regardless of whether the hearing was closed, if the Commission determines this chapter was violated, the charges, all recordings or transcripts of hearings that were made by the Commission, and the Commission's written findings of fact and conclusions of law shall be made public.

~~H~~I. If the Commission determines that a City officer or City employee has violated the provisions of this chapter, the Commission may recommend that the officer or employee be subject to disciplinary action. In addition to any other penalty herein or otherwise provided by law, a violation shall be cause for suspension, discharge, or removal from office, or such other disciplinary action as may, by the appropriate City authority, be deemed necessary and proper, and consistent with personnel ordinances and rules. A written report of the disciplinary action taken as a result of the Commission recommendation shall be made by the appropriate City authority to the Commission within ~~fourteen (14~~14 calendar days after receipt of the Commission's recommendation; provided, that this section shall not derogate from employee rights under any collective bargaining agreement or City personnel ordinance, or rules promulgated thereunto. If the appropriate City authority determines that the written report of disciplinary action taken as a result of the Commission recommendation required in the section cannot be made to the Commission within ~~fourteen (14~~14 calendar days after receipt of the Commission's recommendation, because of procedures prescribed under any collective bargaining agreement, personnel ordinance, or rule promulgated thereunto, the appropriate City authority shall so report to the Commission within ~~fourteen (14~~14 calendar days after receipt of the Commission's recommendation, stating the date on which the written report of disciplinary action taken will be submitted to the Commission. If the violation involves prohibited conduct of a former officer or employee, the Commission may recommend to the administering City authority that no contract be made or that the contract be terminated and that proceedings be begun anew in order to prevent injury to the City or to avoid an unfair advantage accruing to a competitor by reason of the violation. Upon receipt of the written report of the disciplinary action taken, or in the event no report is received, the Commission shall review such matter and make such further recommendation as may be appropriate.

 Section 6. The repeal or amendment of various sections of chapter 4.16 of the Seattle Municipal Code by this ordinance shall not relieve any person of the obligation to have complied with the provisions of such chapter as in effect prior to such repeal or amendment, and any offense committed, conduct engaged in or penalty or forfeiture incurred while the prior section was in force shall be punished or enforced as if the prior section were in force, notwithstanding such amendment or repeal, unless a contrary intention is expressly declared in the amendatory or repealing ordinance, and every such amendatory or repealing ordinance shall be so construed as to save all proceedings under the amended or repealed ordinance pending at the time of the this ordinance, unless a contrary intention is expressly declared herein.

 Section 7. The Ethics and Elections Commission and the City Council intends to monitor the impacts of defining "City contractor" in Section 2 and applying provisions of the City's Ethics Code to City contractors in Sections 3 and 4 of this ordinance. The Ethics and Elections Commission is requested to:
