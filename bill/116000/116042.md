 AN ORDINANCE relating to the Department of Parks and Recreation, authorizing the exchange of portions of vacated N. 42nd Street between Woodlawn Avenue N. and Densmore Avenue N. and portions of Block 14 and Block 17 of Lake Union Addition with Seattle School District #1 in order to accomplish a Lot Boundary Adjustment for purposes of constructing a new gymnasium at Hamilton Middle School; finding the exchange of property meets the requirements of Ordinance 118477; and authorizing acceptance of reimbursed associated costs thereto.

 WHEREAS, the City of Seattle ("City") adopted Resolution Number 28865, committing the City's support to the Seattle School District's Building Excellence Capital Improvement Program ("BEX"); and

 WHEREAS, Hamilton Middle School is adjacent to Wallingford Playfield and is being redeveloped as part of the BEX; and

 WHEREAS, a new 10,500 square foot gymnasium being constructed as part of the redevelopment of Hamilton Middle School will enhance sports and other activities for students and members of the community, and will be available for programming by the Department of Parks and Recreation ("DPR") pursuant to the terms of the Joint Use Agreement in effect between the Seattle School District No. 1 ("SSD #1") and DPR; and

 WHEREAS, a portion of the new gymnasium is proposed to be constructed on vacated North 42nd Street right of way that is currently part of the Wallingford Playfield site; and

 WHEREAS, there is no reasonable alternative to locate the new gymnasium wholly on Hamilton Middle School property, due to the constrained nature of the site and landmark designation of the existing school building; and

 WHEREAS, SSD # 1 has requested and processed a Lot Boundary Adjustment through the Seattle Department of Planning and Development in order to realize its objective of installing the proposed new gymnasium consistent with the plans for redeveloping Hamilton Middle School; and

 WHEREAS, transfer of deeds is necessary to complete an exchange between public agencies in order to fulfill the intent of a Lot Boundary Adjustment; and

 WHEREAS, Ordinance 118477, which enacted Initiative 42, mandated that all lands and facilities held for park and recreation purposes, shall be preserved for such use; and no such land or facility shall be sold, transferred, or changed from park use to another usage, unless the City first holds a public hearing regarding the necessity of such a transaction and then enacts an ordinance finding the transaction is necessary and there is no practical or reasonable alternative; and

 WHEREAS, Ordinance 118477 also states the City shall receive, in exchange, land or a facility of equivalent or better size, value, location, and usefulness in the vicinity, serving the same community and the same park purposes; and

 WHEREAS, a slightly greater-sized portion of the Hamilton Middle School site adjacent to Wallingford Playfield is available for transfer to the City for replacement park purpose; and

 WHEREAS, the land replacing the park land, to be used for a portion of the gymnasium expansion, is slightly greater in size, appraised as equivalent in value, and will serve the same community of users as the existing City-owned parcel; and

 WHEREAS, the public will realize significantly enhanced educational and recreational opportunities as a result of the proposed transaction; and

 WHEREAS, the City Council has held a public hearing in accordance with the requirements of Ordinance 118477; NOW, THEREFORE,

 BE IT ORDAINED BY THE CITY OF SEATTLE AS FOLLOWS:

 Section 1.
