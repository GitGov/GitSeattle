The policies described in this chapter apply to cameras as defined in this chapter. Unless specified otherwise in a particular policy, the policies contained in this chapter apply to all persons employed by the City of Seattle, including agents retained on a temporary, contract, or voluntary basis.

"Cameras" do not include surveillance cameras installed on City property other than in parks, cameras installed in police cars, cameras installed along pubic rights of way intended to record traffic violations, and cameras that are intended primarily to monitor the interiors or entrances of City buildings, including buildings located within City parks.

 B. "Live monitoring" means a person viewing images live in real time as they are being captured and recorded by a camera.

 C. "Active monitoring" means a person manipulating the point and zoom features of a camera in live monitoring mode in order to focus the camera on a particular person.

 18.14.030 Pilot Program - Authorization.

 The Seattle Department of Parks and Recreation (DPR) and the City's Department of Information Technology (DoIT) are authorized to install and operate surveillance cameras in the following Seattle parks as part of a pilot program: Cal Anderson Park, Hing Hay Park, Occidental Park, and Victor Steinbrueck Park. Additional ordinance authority is required to install cameras in other City parks or to operate cameras in the parks identified above beyond ninety days after the program evaluation described in SMC Section 18.14.100 is submitted to the City Council.

 18.14.040 City Policies Regarding the Installation and Use of Cameras.

 A. Cameras are authorized to record video only and are not authorized to record audio.

 B. In order to inform the community of the intended installation and to seek public comment, DPR shall convene, prior to installation, a community meeting for each park in which the installation of cameras is proposed under the pilot project.

 C. Cameras should be installed to primarily record events that take place on public property. It is not a violation of this policy if cameras incidentally record events that occur on private property.

 D. DPR shall prominently post at least one sign in each park where a camera is located informing the public about the presence of the camera(s).

 E. The cameras and related equipment shall be the property of DoIT.

 F. A monitor for the cameras and the controls that enable active monitoring shall be located in SPD's 911 Center.

 E. A DPR or DoIT supervisor must authorize the viewing of video recordings by DPR or DoIT personnel.

This section is not intended to limit: 1) incidental live monitoring of any person or object in view of the cameras when the camera is focused on a permitted subject; or 2) focusing active live monitoring on a possible suspect, witness, victim, or other person based upon the suspect, witness, victim, or other person's reported description or characteristics.
