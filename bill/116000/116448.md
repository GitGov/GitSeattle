 AN ORDINANCE relating to the Mercer Corridor Project; removing a restriction in the 2009-2010 Adopted Budget that limits the Seattle Department of Transportation's spending on the Mercer Corridor Project; removing a restriction in the 2009-2010 Adopted Budget that limits Seattle City Light's spending on the Mercer Corridor Relocations project; and removing a restriction in the 2008 Adopted Budget that limits Seattle City Light's spending on the Mercer Corridor Relocations project.

 WHEREAS, it is in the City's best interest to fund and continue implementation of the Mercer Corridor Project and the Spokane St. Viaduct at this time, prior to initiation of the Alaskan Way Viaduct (AWV) replacement project, because these projects will help lessen the negative impact of the AWV replacement project during construction; and

 WHEREAS, previous versions of the Mercer Corridor Project and the Spokane St. Viaduct finance plans included an unsecured funding gap anticipated from state and federal sources and private participation; and

 WHEREAS, the City Council adopted Ordinance 122686 in May 2008 with the intent of considering future appropriation authority for the Mercer Corridor Project in the context of whether substantial progress is made toward closing the funding gap in both projects; and

 WHEREAS, the City's 2009-2010 Adopted Budget includes an appropriation of $82,450,000 for the Seattle Department of Transportation (SDOT) Mercer Corridor Project with a proviso limiting spending to $30,000,000 until authorized by a future ordinance; and

 WHEREAS, the City's 2009-2010 Adopted Budget includes an appropriation of $7,108,000 for the Seattle City Light (SCL) Mercer Corridor Relocations project with a proviso restricting spending until authorized by a future ordinance; and

 WHEREAS, the City's 2008 Adopted Budget included an appropriation of $11,534,000 for the SCL Mercer Corridor Relocations project with a proviso limiting spending on transmission line undergrounding to $500,000 until authorized by a future ordinance; and

 WHEREAS, SCL has demonstrated that it has secured contributions from those customers requesting transmission line undergrounding; and

 WHEREAS, SDOT has provided the Council with a revised financing plan for the Mercer Corridor project in accordance with Council's 2009- 2010 Adopted Budget Statement of Legislative Intent (SLI 71-2-A-1) as documented in Clerk File 309811; and

 WHEREAS, the revised financing plan identifies proceeds from the future disposition of potential surplus property and right-of-ways as a possible source of revenue to close the existing funding gap for the project; and

 WHEREAS, it is the Council's understanding that to the extent interim financing may be necessary to fully fund the Mercer Corridor project, that the amount of debt and interest owed should be repaid through the disposition of potential surplus property and right-of-way as identified in SDOT's response to Council SLI 71-2-A-1 from the 2009- 2010 Adopted Budget documented in Clerk File 309811; and

 WHEREAS, significant progress has been made towards closing the funding gap and the City Council has had the opportunity to evaluate the revised finance plans and environmental documentation; NOW, THEREFORE,
