 AN ORDINANCE relating to traffic infractions; and amending Seattle Municipal Code Sections 11.31.020 and 11.31.090 and Seattle Municipal Code subsection 11.31.120.C to provide that Seattle Municipal Code Section 11.52.040 may be enforced through the use of evidence detected by an automated traffic safety camera and provide for penalties for such camera- detected violations.

 WHEREAS, excessive vehicle speed is one of the principal factors implicated in pedestrian injuries and fatalities, both locally and nationally; and

 WHEREAS, a recent amendment to RCW 46.63.170 provides that, during the State's 2009-2011 fiscal biennium, the City of Seattle is authorized to use automated traffic safety cameras to enforce speed laws if the local legislative authority first enacts an ordinance authorizing such use; and

 WHEREAS, the Washington State Traffic Commission will assist with the evaluation of the results of a two-year pilot study of the use of automated traffic safety cameras to enforce speed laws in the city; and

 WHEREAS, the City Council has previously authorized the use of automated traffic safety cameras to enforce red light and school zone speed laws; and

 WHEREAS, use of automated traffic safety cameras will enhance enforcement of speed laws and promote public safety, NOW, THEREFORE,

 BE IT ORDAINED BY THE CITY OF SEATTLE AS FOLLOWS:

 Section 1. Effective January 1, 2010, Seattle Municipal Code Section 11.31.020, last amended by Ordinance 121944, is amended as follows:

 SMC 11.31.020 Notice of traffic infraction --Issuance.

 A. A peace officer has the authority to issue a notice of traffic infraction:

 1. when the infraction is committed in the officer's presence;

 2. if an officer investigating at the scene of a motor vehicle accident has reasonable cause to believe that the driver of a motor vehicle involved in the accident has committed a traffic infraction; or

 3. when ~~the infraction is~~a violation of SMC 11.50.140, SMC 11.50.150, SMC 11.52.040 or SMC 11.52.100 is detected through the use of an automated traffic safety camera ~~under Washington Laws of 2005, chapter 167, section 1~~as authorized pursuant to RCW 43.63.170.

 B. A court may issue a notice of traffic infraction upon receipt of a written statement of the officer that there is reasonable cause to believe that an infraction was committed. (RCW 46.63.030)

 Section 2. Effective January 1, 2010, Seattle Municipal Code Section 11.31.090, last amended by Ordinance 122725, is amended as follows:

 SMC 11.31.090 Traffic infractions detected through the use of an automated traffic safety camera.

 A. A notice of infraction based on evidence detected through the use of an automated traffic safety camera must be mailed to the registered owner of the vehicle within ~~fourteen (~~14~~)~~ days of the violation, or to the renter of a vehicle within ~~fourteen (~~14~~)~~days of establishing the renter's name and address under subsection C1 of this section, SMC 11.31.090. The peace officer issuing the notice of infraction shall include with it a certificate or facsimile thereof, based upon inspection of photographs, microphotographs, or electronic images produced by an automated traffic safety camera, stating the facts supporting the notice of infraction. This certificate or facsimile is prima facie evidence of the facts contained in it and is admissible in a proceeding charging a violation of Section 11.50.140, Section 11.50.150, Section 11.52.040, or Section 11.52.100. The photographs, microphotographs, or electronic images evidencing the violation must be available for inspection and admission into evidence in a proceeding to adjudicate the liability for the infraction.

 B. A person receiving such a notice of infraction may respond to the notice by mail. The registered owner of a vehicle is responsible for such an infraction unless the registered owner overcomes the presumption in  SMC subsection 11.31.090.E ~~of this section~~, or, in the case of a rental car business, satisfies the conditions under SMC subsection 11.31.090.C ~~of this section~~. If appropriate under the circumstances, a renter identified under SMC subsection  11.31.090.C1 ~~of this section~~ is responsible for such an infraction.

 C. If the registered owner of the vehicle is a rental car business, the peace officer shall, before such a notice of infraction is issued, provide a written notice to the rental car business that a notice of infraction may be issued to the rental car business if the rental car business does not, within ~~eighteen(~~18~~)~~ days of receiving the written notice, provide to the peace officer by return mail:

 1. A statement under oath stating the name and known mailing address of the individual driving or renting the vehicle when the infraction occurred; or

 2. A statement under oath that the business is unable to determine who was driving or renting the vehicle at the time the infraction occurred; or

 3. In lieu of identifying the vehicle operator, the rental car business may pay the applicable penalty.

 Timely mailing of this statement to the peace officer relieves a rental car business of any liability under ~~this c~~Chapter 11.31 for the notice of infraction.

 D. ~~For the purposes of this section~~The term "automated traffic safety camera" means a device that uses a vehicle sensor installed to work in conjunction with an intersection traffic control system and a camera synchronized to automatically record one ~~(1)~~or more sequenced photographs, microphotographs, or electronic images of the rear of a motor vehicle at the time the vehicle fails to stop when facing a steady red traffic control signal.

 E. In a traffic infraction case involving an infraction detected through the use of an automated traffic safety camera, proof that the particular vehicle described in the notice of traffic infraction was in violation of Section 11.50.140, Section 11.50.150, Section 11.52.040, or SMC 11.52.100, together with proof that the person named in the notice of traffic infraction was at the time of the violation the registered owner of the vehicle, constitutes in evidence a prima facie presumption that the registered owner of the vehicle was the person in control of the vehicle at the point where, and for the time during which, the violation occurred. This presumption may be overcome only if the registered owner states, under oath, in a written statement to the court or in testimony before the court that the vehicle involved was, at the time, stolen or in the care, custody, or control of some person other than the registered owner.

 Section 3. The authority to use automated traffic safety cameras to enforce SMC 11.52.040 shall expire as of June 30, 2011 unless the state legislature further authorizes such enforcement.

 Section 4. Effective January 1, 2010, Seattle Municipal Code subsection 11.31.120.C, last amended by Ordinance 122725, is amended as follows:

 SMC 11.31.120 Monetary penalties.

 ***

 C. A traffic infraction for violation of Section 11.50.140, Section 11.50.150, Section 11.52.040, or Section 11.52.100 detected through the use of an automated traffic safety camera shall be processed in the same manner as a parking infraction, with a monetary penalty equal to the total penalty, including the base penalty plus any statutory assessments authorized under state law, for violations of such Sections otherwise detected by a police officer.

 Section 5. This ordinance shall take effect and be in force thirty (30) days from and after its approval by the Mayor, but if not approved and returned by the Mayor within ten (10) days after presentation, it shall take effect as provided by Municipal Code Section 1.04.020.
