 AN ORDINANCE relating to conduct in public places; establishing nighttime disturbance as a civil infraction, creating a new section 15.48.050 of the Seattle Municipal Code and amending section 15.48.900 relating to penalties for nighttime disturbance.

 WHEREAS, in December 2007 the City Council passed Resolution 31003 to create a Nightlife Advisory Board to advise the Council in 2008 and 2009 regarding nightlife issues; and

 WHEREAS, Resolution 31003 noted the City Council seeks to support, maintain and promote an active and safe environment that fosters a successful music and nightlife industry, and that increasing density in the City's urban centers and villages has created the demand for balancing neighborhood livability with vibrant nightlife activity; and

 WHEREAS, the Nightlife Advisory Board consisted of representatives from neighborhoods and

 the music and nightlife industry, a noise expert, a Liquor Control Board member, and a representative with public safety experience; and

 WHEREAS, the Nightlife Advisory Board's duties included advising the City Council regarding policy issues related to the City's promotion, development and sustainability of the nightlife industry in Seattle, including the effectiveness of the City's enforcement of nightlife related regulations; and emerging nightlife issues related to increasing density in urban villages and centers; and developing possible recommendations for improvements to the rules and processes associated with regulating nightlife activities; and

 WHEREAS, in December 2009 the Nightlife Advisory Board issued its Final Report, and

 recommended the City Council "Revise City Ordinances to allow Seattle Police greater ability to enforce public nuisances and disturbances violations, specifically fighting and drunk and disorderly conduct...and for officers to issue a citation in the form of a ticket to those who do not correct or cease the behavior;" and

 WHEREAS, the Nightlife Advisory Board has issued a statement stating that it "agrees that this recommendation provides the greatest opportunity to address undesirable behavior and thus address one of the biggest problems often associated with nightlife," and

 WHEREAS, this ordinance is a critical component of the broader Seattle Nightlife Initiative, which envisions a full suite of actions that together provide a comprehensive, balanced approach to managing the city's nighttime economy.
