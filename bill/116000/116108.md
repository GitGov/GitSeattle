 ORDINANCE _________________

 AN ORDINANCE related to the sale and redevelopment of the former Public Safety Building block; authorizing the execution of a Purchase and Sale Agreement, Project Agreement and other related documents necessary to implement the sale and redevelopment of such property; and exempting the sale of such property from the requirements of Resolution 29799 as amended by Resolution 30862.

 WHEREAS, Resolution 30769, adopted in May 2005, stated the City's preferred approach to the redevelopment of the Public Safety Building Site, including objectives consistent with the Civic Center Master Plan vision for civic public open space, private development, underground parking, and pedestrian access to the Metro/Sound Transit bus tunnel; and directed the Director of the Fleets and Facilities Department to proceed with a public solicitation for development proposals; and

 WHEREAS, a Request for Concepts for redevelopment of the Site was published and distributed in April 2006 and three of the development teams responding to the Request for Concepts were invited to respond to a Request for Proposals issued in September 2006; and

 WHEREAS, Triad Civic Center LLC ("Triad") was selected as the preferred developer for redevelopment of the Site; and

 WHEREAS, Triad has proposed to develop a signature project for this critical block situated in south downtown that will be consistent with the Civic Center Master Plan, enhance the vibrancy of the area, and contribute to its economic vitality; and

 WHEREAS, the City and Triad signed a Letter of Intent in February 2007, demonstrating the City's intent to proceed with the sale of the Site to Triad and Triad's commitment to develop a portion of the Site

 as a public plaza (the "Civic Square"); and

 WHEREAS, in August 2007, Resolution 31007 requested that the Director of the Fleets and Facilities Department or his or her designee negotiate a Purchase and Sale Agreement with Triad for the Site; and

 WHEREAS, the Fleets and Facilities Department has negotiated a Purchase and Sale Agreement and a Project Agreement with Triad ("Agreements"). The Agreements between the City and Triad contain the following business elements: The City agrees to sell the Site to Triad for consideration valued at $25,000,000. In return, Triad will develop the Site and will finance all aspects of the development. As part of the development of the Site, Triad agrees to construct the Civic Square on the south portion of the Site, consisting of a public plaza and associated retail space to help activate the Civic Square. After completion of the Civic Square, Triad will convey the Civic Square back to the City as part of the consideration for the Site.

 The difference between the cost to construct the Civic Square and $25,000,000 will be paid to the City in cash; Now, therefore,

 BE IT ORDAINED BY THE CITY OF SEATTLE AS FOLLOWS:

 Section 1. The Director of the Fleets and Facilities Department or his or her designee is authorized to sell to Triad Civic Center LLC ("Triad") the property located at 600 Third Avenue in the City of Seattle, hereinafter referred to as the "Site" and legally described as follows:

 THIS PURCHASE AND SALE AGREEMENT ("Agreement") is made on or as of the _____ day of January, 2008, by and between The City of Seattle, a Washington municipal corporation ("Seller"), and Triad Civic Center LLC, a Washington limited liability company ("Purchaser").

 RECITALS

 WHEREAS the City owns that certain real property located in King County, Washington which property is the site of the former Public Safety Building and is currently vacant and surplus to City needs; and

 WHEREAS Triad intends to purchase the property and to construct a building for mixed residential, commercial and office uses, and parking; and

 WHEREAS the City desires to establish a civic square on a

 portion of the property to provide open space and services for the enjoyment and well-being of downtown workers, residents and visitors; and

 WHEREAS as a condition to its purchase of the property Triad is willing to construct a civic square on the southern portion of the property and upon completion, to sell and convey the civic square to the City or its designee;

 NOW, THEREFORE,

 IN CONSIDERATION of the respective agreements hereinafter set forth, Seller and Purchaser do each hereby covenant and agree with the other as follows:

 1. Purchase and Sale

 .

 (a) Seller agrees to sell and convey to Purchaser, and Purchaser agrees to purchase from Seller, on the terms and conditions set forth in this Agreement, the Property. As used herein, the term "Property" means, collectively:

 (i) that certain parcel of land located at 600 Third Avenue in the City of Seattle and more particularly described as:

 Lots 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 and 8, Block 32, Addition to the Town of Seattle as laid out on the claims of C. D. Boren and A. A. Denny and H. L. Yesler (commonly known as C. D. Boren's Addition to the City of Seattle), according to the plat thereof recorded in Volume 1 of Plats, Page 25, in King County, Washington, together with the vacated alley in said Block adjoining said Lots;

 Except the southwesterly 9 feet of Lots 1, 4, 5 and 8, condemned in King County Superior Court Cause Number 54135 for the widening of Third Avenue, as provided by Ordinance Number 14345 of the City of Seattle; and

 Except the northeasterly 9 feet of Lots 2, 3, 6 and 7, condemned in King County Superior Court Cause Number 50320 for the widening of

 Fourth Avenue, as provided by Ordinance Number 13074 of the City of Seattle; and

 (ii) all of Seller's right, title and interest in and to all rights and interests appurtenant to the Property including, but not limited to, any development rights, mineral rights, or other rights owned by, or leased to, Seller; and

 (iii) all other improvements owned by Seller located on the Property.

 (b) Seller and Purchaser hereby acknowledge that Purchaser intends to use the Property to construct and erect on the Property a mixed-use tower containing office, residential and commercial space, and underground parking. Purchaser has agreed, as a condition to its purchase of the Property, to construct a civic square (the "Civic Square") on a portion of the Property generally depicted in the attached Exhibit A (the "Civic Square Area"),

 substantially similar in design, structure, composition and scale to the concept contained in Purchaser's "Seattle Civic Square Summary" submitted to Seller on December 1, 2006, as subsequently modified by Purchaser's third submission for early design guidance from the City of Seattle Department of Planning and Development and included in the Conceptual Design Documents (as defined in the Civic Square Agreement). Upon completion of construction of Purchaser's project, Purchaser shall sell and convey the Civic Square to the City or its designee. To accomplish these objectives, simultaneous with the execution of this Agreement the parties shall enter into an agreement (the "Civic Square Agreement") consistent in form and content as that set forth in Exhibit B attached hereto, providing, among other matters, for Purchaser's construction of the Civic Square in the Civic Square Area and its subsequent transfer to the City.

 2. Purchase Price

 .

 (a) The "Minimum Purchase Price" for the Property shall be the sum of (1) TWENTY FIVE MILLION and 00/100 Dollars ($25,000,000.00), plus (2) the Interest Adjustment (defined below). The Minimum Purchase Price shall be paid as follows:

 (i) Within five (5) days after the mutual execution and delivery of this Agreement, Purchaser shall deposit an amount equal to the amount by which $500,000 exceeds the Incurred Civic Square Design Costs as the initial earnest money deposit (the "Earnest Money") with the downtown Seattle office of Chicago Title Insurance Company ("Title Company"), to secure Purchaser's performance hereunder. The Earnest Money shall be non-refundable to Purchaser unless the transaction fails to close due to the condition of title to the Property, as described in Subsection 5(a); or for any of the reasons identified in Section 7; or due to Seller's default, or for another reason set forth in this Agreement or the Civic Square Agreement under which Purchaser is entitled to a refund of such Earnest Money. "Incurred Civic Square Design Costs" shall mean the costs actually incurred subsequent to the parties' execution of their Letter of Intent dated February 22, 2007 in connection with the design of the Civic Square (including, as applicable, conceptual design and schematic design, engineering and related costs), provided that the results and work product associated with such design work are assignable to the Seller for use at the Property in the event this Agreement terminates for any reason other than a default by Seller. Simultaneously with the execution of this Agreement, and again following issuance of the master use permit for the proposed project, Purchaser shall provide Seller with an accounting of the

 then-current Incurred Civic Square Design Costs, together with evidence reasonably satisfactory to Seller that the work product associated therewith is assignable to Seller. To the extent Civic Square Design Costs also include an allocable share of design, engineering and related costs applicable to the project as a whole, the costs attributable to Civic Square Design Costs shall be as reasonably allocated by the architects, engineers and other service providers actually performing such work. Assignability of the designs and work product related to the Civic Square means that Seller may use such designs with respect to the Property, subject to customary restrictions and limitations imposed by the architects, engineers and other service providers who prepared the designs and work product; provided that, prior to Closing, Purchaser shall confirm to Seller's reasonable satisfaction that such architects, engineers and other service providers consent to the assignability to Seller of the designs and work product related to the Civic Square.

 (ii) Three (3) business days after the City of Seattle has issued a master use permit for Purchaser's proposed project (such master use permit to be sought by Purchaser under the Civic Square Agreement) and the period for the filing of an appeal has expired without an appeal having been filed (or if an appeal is filed, the appeal is finally resolved), Purchaser shall adjust the Earnest Money to equal the amount by which $1,000,000 exceeds the Incurred Civic Square Design Costs. If the Closing does occur, the full amount of the Earnest Money shall be credited toward the payment of the Minimum Purchase Price to be paid by Purchaser to Seller at Closing. Purchaser shall be entitled to the benefit of any interest earned on the Earnest Money.

 (iii) At Closing, Purchaser shall pay to Seller in cash (the "Cash Payment") the remainder of the Minimum Purchase Price after crediting toward the payment of the Minimum Purchase Price (a) the Earnest Money to the extent that any funds have been deposited (and if no funds have been deposited as a result of the magnitude of the Civic Square Design Costs, then there will be no Earnest Money credit toward the Minimum Purchase Price) and (b) the Civic Square Cost Cap (as defined in the Civic Square Agreement). Along with the Cash Payment, and as a portion of the Minimum Purchase Price due at Closing, Buyer shall also pay to Seller an amount equal to the accrued interest on the Cash Payment at the rate of 5.02% per annum (non-compounded) from the date Buyer is required to adjust Earnest Money under subsection (ii) above until Closing (the "Interest Adjustment"). A portion of the Cash Payment plus the Interest Payment shall be paid to Seller and such amount shall constitute the Civic Square Cost Contingency to be used in accordance with the terms of the Civic Square Agreement.

 (iv) The remainder of the Minimum Purchase Price (which shall be equal to the Civic Square Cost Cap) shall be evidenced by a promissory note (the "Note") from Purchaser to Seller consistent in form and content as attached hereto as Exhibit C. The Note shall be due and payable at such time as Purchaser completes the construction of and conveys to Seller or its designee the Civic Square in accordance with the terms of the Civic Square Agreement, or as otherwise provided in the Note. There shall be credited toward the payment of the Note (A) the actual costs of design and construction of the Civic Square as provided in the Civic Square Agreement, and (B) $3,000,000.00 representing Seller's and Purchaser's agreed value of the Civic Square Contribution Amount under the REA.

 (b) Purchaser intends to seek a portion of the financing for Purchaser's intended development project through debt and equity investments from a community development entity that qualifies for new market tax credits under Section 45D of the Internal Revenue Code. To the extent Purchaser is successful in doing so, Purchaser shall pay to Seller as additional consideration for the purchase of the Property an amount equal to the Net NMTC Value of such investment, not to exceed $1,270,000 (the "Supplemental Payment"), subject to adjustment pursuant to Section 11(d) below. For purposes hereunder, the Net NMTC Value shall be the amount by which the net present value of the debt and/or equity contributions to Purchaser that qualify for new market tax credits is less than net present value of obtaining such debt and/or equity financing from third parties at then current market rates. The determination of Net NMTC Value shall be made by Reznick, Fedder & Silverman ("Reznick") on behalf of Purchaser and Seller upon the later of Closing or the date the amount of debt and/or equity financing that qualifies for new market tax credits is finally established, and absent manifest error shall be binding on Purchaser and Seller.

 (i) Payment of the Supplemental Payment by Purchaser to Seller shall be made on the later of (i) ten (10) business days following the determination of the amount of the Supplemental Payment by Reznick, (ii) sixty (60) days following the actual receipt by Purchaser of the qualified debt and/or equity investment from the community development entity that qualifies for new market tax credits, and (iii) Closing. If such investment is advanced to Purchaser over time, the installment payments of the investment actually received by Purchaser shall first be used to pay the Supplemental Payment.

 (ii) In determining the net present value of the debt and/or equity contributions to Purchaser that qualify for new market tax credits, there shall be taken into account the actual third party costs, fees and expenses incurred by Purchaser to seek, qualify for, arrange and obtain the debt and/or equity financing that qualifies for new market tax credits, including allocable fees, costs and expenses of the community development entity, its counsel, Purchaser's counsel and other third party consultants retained by Purchaser to facilitate such investment (collectively, the "Qualification Costs"). The Qualification Costs shall be limited to those which are actually incurred with respect to the project described by this Agreement and, upon Seller's request, Purchaser shall provide Seller with an itemization of the Qualification Costs sufficiently detailed to permit Seller to determine the nature of the costs, the identity of the provider of the service(s) associated with the costs, the amount of time spent by such service providers attributable to the costs and the time period during which the costs were incurred. In the event Seller disputes the inclusion of any item described in Purchaser's itemization of the Qualification Costs, such dispute shall be resolved by a determination made in good faith by Reznick. The fees and costs of Reznick to determine the Net NMTC Value and to resolve any dispute regarding the Qualification Costs shall be paid by Purchaser but shall also be taken into account in determining the net present value of the debt or equity contributions to Purchaser that qualify for new market tax credits.

 3. Title to the Property

 . At Closing, the Title Company shall issue to Purchaser an owner's standard coverage title insurance policy in the amount of the Minimum Purchase Price, insuring fee simple title to the Property, and subject only to the Permitted Exceptions (the "Title Policy"). As used herein, the term "Permitted Exceptions" means, collectively: (a) the preprinted exceptions commonly contained in an owner's standard policy, (b) non-delinquent liens for general real estate taxes and assessments; and (c) the transit tunnel easement in favor of King County. At Purchaser's option, Purchase may elect to obtain an extended coverage policy of title insurance, provided (y) Purchaser pays any increased premium for extended coverage, and (z) Purchaser provides any surveys required by the Title Company to issue extended coverage. If Purchaser elects to obtain extended coverage title insurance, Seller agrees to provide to the Title Company such affidavits and indemnities as the Title Company may reasonable request in order for the Title Company to issue such extended coverage.

 4. Waiver of Feasibility Period

 . Purchaser acknowledges that it has previously conducted and completed to Purchaser's satisfaction a feasibility investigation with respect to the Property, that Purchaser has determined the current condition of the Property to be acceptable, and that this Agreement does not contain a feasibility contingency.

 5. Title Matters

 . Purchaser acknowledges that it has received a copy of the Commitment for Title Insurance from Chicago Title Insurance Company, issued March 20, 2007, under Order No. 1232493 (the "Preliminary Report") and represents that the same contains no objectionable matters.

 (a) Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the Title Company issues any supplement ("Supplement") to the Preliminary Report during the term of this Agreement, Purchaser shall have ten (10) business days following delivery of such Supplement to Purchaser to deliver an Objection Notice to Seller identifying any exceptions contained therein and not disclosed in the Preliminary Report, or any prior Supplement thereto to which Purchaser objects. Seller shall have three (3) business days after receipt of such Objection Notice to give Purchaser a Seller's Title Notice specifying which Objectionable Matters identified in the Objection Notice Seller shall cause to be removed from title on or before the Closing Date. If Seller shall fail to timely provide a Seller's Title Notice, Seller shall be deemed to have declined to remove all such Objectionable Matters.

 (b) If Seller does not elect to remove all Objectionable Matters, Purchaser shall have five (5) business days from the date of Seller's Title Notice to elect by a Purchaser's Title Notice to proceed with the purchase (in which event all Objectionable Matters that Seller has not agreed to remove shall be deemed Permitted Exceptions) or to terminate this Agreement and obtain a refund of the Earnest Money if Purchaser determines in good faith that such exception, makes it commercially unfeasible to develop the Property as planned. If Purchaser shall fail to timely provide a Purchaser's Title Notice, Purchaser shall be deemed to have elected to proceed with the purchase.

 6. License

 . Seller grants to Purchaser and its agents (including prospective investors and lenders), a license to enter the Property during the term of this Agreement upon three (3) days' prior written notice to Seller, who shall arrange such access as Purchaser shall reasonably require, for the purpose of reviewing and investigating the Property in connection with Purchaser's proposed development thereof. The time, place and manner of investigation shall be fully described to Seller prior to entry and no investigation, inspection, analysis, study or survey shall be made that Seller has not approved in advance. Notwithstanding the foregoing, any invasive or destructive testing shall be conducted at an agreed time, and in a manner intended to minimize disruption to Seller and may require proof of insurance adequate to the risk of damage to persons or loss to the Property or any adjacent property owned by Seller. Seller shall not unreasonably withhold approval and shall endeavor to make access to the Property available for inspections. In the event that this Agreement terminates without Closing, Purchaser covenants and agrees to repair any damage to the Property occasioned by Purchaser's entry upon the Property or the conduct of any inspection, study or survey by or for Purchaser. Such repair shall be to the condition in which the Property existed immediately prior to Purchaser's initial entry upon the Property pursuant to the license granted herein. Purchaser shall indemnify and hold harmless Seller for any costs, loss or damage whatsoever incurred as a result of Purchaser's entry upon the Property and conduct of the inspection, study or survey (provided that Purchaser shall have no liability for the mere discovery of pre-existing conditions). The provisions of this Section 6 shall survive the Closing or termination of this Agreement.

 7. Purchaser's Conditions to Closing

 . The following conditions are precedent to Purchaser's obligation to acquire the Property and to deliver the Minimum Purchase Price ("Purchaser's Closing Conditions"). If any of Purchaser's Closing Conditions are not satisfied as of the Closing Date as determined by Purchaser in Purchaser's reasonable discretion, Purchaser may elect by written notice to Seller to terminate the Agreement hereunder.

 (g) Purchaser shall, following the full execution of this Agreement, diligently pursue the issuance of all permits and approvals necessary for the development of Purchaser's proposed project in accordance with the Civic Center Agreement.

 (h) Purchaser shall undertake the work necessary to have Approved Construction Documents for the Civic Elements and a Cost Estimate for the Civic Elements based upon such Approved Construction Documents (all as defined in the Civic Center Agreement) to be completed not later than July 30, 2009.

 11. Default and Termination

 . If either party to this Agreement shall fail or refuse to perform or satisfy a material obligation under this Agreement and such failure or refusal continues for a period of fifteen (15) days after written notice from the other party of such failure or refusal, and if the other party has performed all of its obligations hereunder then capable of being performed, then the party who has failed or refused to perform shall be in default and the non-defaulting party may elect from the following remedies:

 (a) Seller in Default. In the event that Seller is in default, Purchaser may recover from Seller the Earnest Money together with accrued interest thereon and all of Purchaser's due diligence, pursuit, permitting and legal costs and expenses and, by written notice to Seller, abandon this transaction. In the alternative, Purchaser may seek specific performance of this Agreement.

 (b) Purchaser in Default. In the event Purchaser is in default (including, but not limited to Purchaser's obligations under Section 10(g) above and Purchaser's obligation to close the purchase of the Property within the time period specified in Section 11(c) below), Seller shall have the right to terminate Purchaser's right to purchase the Property and retain the Earnest Money. In addition, Seller shall be entitled to an assignment from Purchaser of the plans, specifications and work product associated with the design of the Civic Square (at no cost to Seller, but otherwise without warranty from Purchaser). The foregoing rights shall be Seller's sole and exclusive remedies. The foregoing limitation on remedies shall not apply to Purchaser's indemnification obligations under this Agreement.

 (c) Termination by Expiration of Time. Closing shall occur on or before December 31, 2009 (the "Expiration Date"), subject to the extension rights provided in this Section 11(c).

 (i) The Expiration Date shall be extended for the period of time necessary to resolve any (A) appeal or (B) challenge by any administrative or judicial proceeding of any of the terms and conditions of the transaction set forth in this Agreement or the Civic Square Agreement or the issuance of any permit or approval necessary for the construction of Purchaser's proposed project, not to exceed an extension period of four (4) years.

 (ii) Purchaser may extend the Closing Date established pursuant to Section 12(b) below for a period up to

 eighteen (18) months by providing written notice to Seller of Purchaser's election to extend the Closing Date; provided, however, in no event shall the Closing Date be extended beyond December 31, 2013.

 (iii) In no event shall the Expiration Date be extended beyond December 31, 2013.

 (d) Effect of Extension.

 (i) If Closing has not occurred by July 30, 2009, Purchaser shall be responsible for any increase in the cost of constructing the Civic Elements in accordance with the Approved Construction Documents above the Construction Cost Cap in effect as of July 30, 2009 and established pursuant to the Civic Square Agreement, other than increases caused by City-Initiated Change Orders or City Delays.

 (ii) If Closing has not occurred by July 30, 2009, the Civic Square Contribution Amount paid by Purchaser pursuant to the REA shall increase in an amount equal to the percentage increase in the CPI from July 30, 2009, until the Closing Date, and shall thereafter increase commencing five (5) years following the commencement of the obligation to make payments of the Civic Square Contribution Amount, and each five (5) years thereafter, in an amount equal to the percentage increase in the CPI during such five (5) year periods.

 (iii) If Purchaser elects to extend the Closing pursuant to Section 11(c)(ii) above for a period in excess of twelve (12) months, then the Supplemental Payment shall increase in an amount equal to fifty percent (50%) of the amount by which the total Net NMTC Value (including the first $1,270,000 to be paid to the Seller) exceeds Two Million Five Hundred Forty Thousand Dollars ($2,540,000.00). By way of example only, if the total Net NMTC Value is Three Million Dollars ($3,000,000.00), and Purchaser elects to extend the Closing for a period of fifteen (15) months pursuant to Section 11(c)(ii) above, then the Supplemental Payment would increase by fifty percent (50%) of Four Hundred Sixty Thousand Dollars ($460,000), or Two Hundred Thirty Thousand Dollars ($230,000.00). A summary of the allocation of the total Net NMTC Value under the foregoing example is:

 Total Net NMTC Value = $3,000,000.00

 The first $1,270,000.00 is paid to Seller as part of the Supplemental Payment;

 The next $1,270,000.00 is retained by Purchaser;

 The next $460,000.00 is split equally between Seller, as part of the Supplemental Payment and Purchaser; and

 The total Supplemental Payment is $1,270,000.00 + $230,000.00 = $1,500,000.00.

 12. Closing and Escrow.

 (a) Upon mutual execution of this Agreement, the parties hereto shall deposit an executed counterpart of this Agreement with Title Company and this Agreement shall serve as instructions to Title Company for consummation of the purchase and sale contemplated hereby. Seller and Purchaser agree to execute such additional escrow instructions as may be appropriate to enable the Title Company to comply with the terms of this Agreement; provided, however, that in the event of any conflict between the provisions of this Agreement and any supplementary escrow instructions (other than joint escrow instructions), the terms of this Agreement shall control.

 (b) The parties shall conduct an escrow Closing pursuant to this Section 12 on either (i) the date that is thirty (30) days after all permits necessary for the construction of Purchaser's proposed project have been issued and each of the conditions to Closing set forth in this Agreement and the Civic Square Agreement have been satisfied or waived, or (ii) on such other earlier date as designated by Purchaser upon ten (10) days prior written notice to Seller (provided the Seller's Closing Conditions have been satisfied and waived by Seller) (the date upon which Closing is to occur shall be referred to as the "Closing Date"). The Closing Date may be extended pursuant to Section 11(c) above with permitted extensions of the Expiration Date. In the event the Closing does not occur on or before the Closing Date, as the Closing Date may be extended pursuant to Section 11(c) above, the Title Company shall, unless it is notified by both parties to the contrary within five (5) days after the Closing Date, return to the depositor thereof any non-monetary items which were deposited hereunder. Any such return shall not, however, relieve either party of any liability it may have for its wrongful failure to close.

 (c) At or before Closing, Seller shall deliver to Title Company (for delivery to Purchaser upon Closing) the following:

 (i) a duly executed and acknowledged bargain and sale deed in the form attached hereto as Exhibit D (the "Deed");

 (ii) such ordinances, authorizations, or other documents relating to Seller as Title Company shall require;

 (i) such resolutions, authorizations, and/or other documents or agreements relating to Purchaser as Title Company shall require;

 (ii) the certificate certifying as to Purchaser's representations and warranties as Section 10, above, requires;

 (iii) the Cash Payment described in Subsection 2(a), together with a fully executed promissory note in the form attached hereto as Exhibit C; and

 (iv) any other customary and/or reasonable closing documents that Title Company or Seller request.

 (e) Seller and Purchaser shall each deposit such other instruments as Title Company reasonably requires or are otherwise required to close the escrow and consummate the acquisition of the Property in accordance with the terms hereof. Seller and Purchaser hereby designate Title Company as the "Reporting Person" for the transaction pursuant to Section 6045(e) of the Internal Revenue Code and the regulations promulgated thereunder and agree to execute such documentation as is reasonably necessary to effectuate such designation.

 (f) The following are to be apportioned as of the Closing Date as follows, with Purchaser being deemed to be the owner of the Property during the entire day on which the Deed is recorded, and being obligated to pay all expenses of the Property, with respect to such day:

 (i) Apportionments; Closing Costs. Seller shall pay all transfer taxes with respect to the Property, the premium for the Title Policy to the extent of the premium that would have been charged for a standard coverage policy, and one-half (1/2) of the escrow fee. Purchaser shall pay any recording fees, one-half (1/2) of the escrow fee and the additional premium for an extended coverage Title Policy and such other endorsements as Purchaser requests. All other costs and charges of the escrow for the sale not otherwise provided for in this Subsection 12(f)(i) or elsewhere in this Agreement shall be allocated in accordance with the applicable closing customs for the county in which the Property is located, as determined by the Title Company.

 (ii) Real Estate Taxes and Special Assessments. Purchaser shall be liable for all real estate taxes and assessments accruing after the Closing Date. Purchaser and Seller acknowledge that the Property is currently exempt from taxes.

 (iii) Post-Closing Reconciliation. If any of the aforesaid prorations cannot be calculated accurately on the Closing Date, then they shall be calculated as soon after the Closing Date as feasible. Either party owing the other party a sum of money based on such subsequent proration(s) shall promptly pay said sum to the other

 (g) The provisions of Subsection 12 (f) shall survive the Closing.

 13. Condition of Property; Risk of Loss

 . Seller shall deliver the Property to Purchaser at Closing in substantially the same physical condition as of the date of Seller's execution of this Agreement, ordinary wear and tear and risk of loss due to casualty excepted. Seller shall bear the risk of loss or damage to the Property until Closing. Thereafter, Purchaser shall bear the risk of loss. The Property shall be delivered to Purchaser free and clear of all leases, occupancy agreements and parties in possession.

 14. Purchaser's Consent to New Contracts Affecting the Property; Termination of Existing Contracts

 . Seller shall not, after the mutual execution of this Agreement, create any new encumbrance or lien affecting the Property other than liens and encumbrances (a) that are reasonably capable of being discharged prior to Closing and (b) that in fact will be and are discharged prior to Closing. The obligations set forth in this Section 14 shall survive Closing to the extent such obligations are violated prior to Closing.

 15. Permitting and Entitlements

 . During the term of this Agreement, Purchaser shall be fully authorized to seek a master use permit and other permits and approvals for Purchaser's intended development of the Property (consistent with and subject to the terms of the Civic Square Agreement).

At the option of Triad, elements of Garage shall be reserved for the exclusive use of residential units in the Tower and/or other Tower occupants and also include options for valet parking.

 3.2.2. Civic Square. The Civic Square shall be developed on the Civic Square Parcel and shall be constructed in accordance with the requirements of this Agreement. The Civic Square (including the Civic Square Retail Space) shall be an integral part of the Project and shall be comprised of an area substantially as set forth in Exhibit C which shall, together with the Civic Square Retail Space, cover at least fifty-five percent (55%) of the surface area of the Property, or such other area as approved by the City as reflected in the Approved Construction Documents. Operation and management of the Civic Square shall be governed by an operation and management plan (the "O&M Plan") to be mutually approved by City and Triad acting reasonably and in good faith prior to Closing under the Purchase and Sale Agreement. Among other matters, the O&M Plan (and/or the REA) will contain provisions establishing a Civic Square Account into which Triad and the City will make certain deposits and payments (including certain payments from after hours operation of the Garage, certain payments under the Master Lease and certain payments from Triad to the City) and which fund shall be used exclusively for maintenance, repair, operation and security for the Civic Square.

The Metro Access Improvements shall be those Improvements necessary to be constructed pursuant to the Metro Easement (and/or other agreements among Triad, the City and Metro) to provide access to and from the Project to public transportation services operated by Metro.

 4. Project Design. Triad shall, at Triad's sole cost and expense, diligently design the Project and apply for all Permits required for the construction of the Project in accordance with the terms of this Agreement and all Legal Requirements (provided that Permits associated with the Metro Access Improvements may be separately applied for by Metro and/or jointly by Triad and Metro).

 4.1. Schedule for Design and Construction. City and Triad acknowledge and agree that the timing of Triad's performance of its obligations under this Agreement to complete the Project shall conform to the Development Schedule attached hereto as Exhibit B (subject to Unavoidable Delays, City Delays and revisions to the Development Schedule as provided herein). The Development Schedule contains time periods for Triad to make certain submittals in connection with design and permitting of the Project and certain estimates of the time periods to complete construction of the Project Elements. The Development Schedule shall be updated from time to time during the design and permitting process, and the Development Schedule with respect to construction of the Civic Elements will be updated and finalized (based on construction schedules provided by the contractors and subcontractors retained by Triad to construct the Project) after issuance of the Permits for initial construction of the Project and prior to Closing under the Purchase and Sale Agreement.

 4.2. Plans and Specifications.

 4.2.1. Conceptual Design Documents. As of the date of this Agreement, City and Triad have reviewed and approved the initial Conceptual Drawings and a narrative description addressing scale and relationship of the Project and its various fundamental elements, including, but not limited to, driveways, sidewalks, plazas, landscaping, building envelopes, and water features to be located on the Civic Square, as well as the interface of the Civic Square with the other elements of the Project (which initial Conceptual Drawings and narrative description are referred to collectively as the "Conceptual Design Documents") and are listed on Exhibit C. The Conceptual Design Documents and narrative is a refinement of the concept proposed by Triad in the Civic Square Summary.

 4.2.2. Design Development Documents. Upon execution of this Agreement, Triad shall, in conjunction with the Design Team, commence and complete designs, plans and specifications for the development of the Project (collectively, "Design Documents") in substantial accordance with the Development Schedule. Design Documents shall be drafted, revised and approved in phases as follows:

 a. Schematic Design. During Schematic Design, the schematic design of the Project Elements shall be prepared, and the Project shall be submitted to the City for approval of the fundamental architectural elements of the design and location of Improvements within the Property. Compliance of the Project with zoning regulations and codes affecting the work shall be confirmed and site inspections shall be completed. Schematic Design shall determine the general scope, preliminary design, scale and relationships among the components of the Project. The Design Documents shall evidence a clearly defined design with a comprehensive scope, budget and schedule. The Design Documents at the conclusion of "Schematic Design" shall show a level of complete detail for the Civic Square and the interface of the Civic Square with the remainder of the Project (exclusive of mechanical and electrical elements) consistent with City of Seattle requirements for submittal of an application for a MUP for the Project. All Design Documents completed during Schematic Design shall be generally consistent with the Conceptual Design Documents. The Schematic Design shall be reviewed and approved by the City pursuant to terms of this Agreement prior to the MUP application for the Project.

 b. Early Design Development. During Early Design Development, the scope of work previously approved in the Schematic Design phase shall be refined and the Civic Elements shall be further developed to a level of detail necessary to complete a basic, coordinated description of all aspects of the Civic Square and the interface of the Civic Square with the rest of the Project. The Design Documents at the completion of the "Early Design Development" shall show an approximately thirty-five percent (35%) complete detail for the Civic Square and the interface of the Civic Square with the remainder of the Project (or other level of detail mutually approved by the City and Triad and representing a logical early design review point). Major elements including equipment, fire protection, mechanical, electrical, structural, telecommunications, plumbing and landscaping systems shall be included in the Design Documents at the completion of Early Design Development. All Design Documents and the scope of work of the Project completed during Early Design Development shall be generally consistent with the Schematic Design previously approved by the City.

 c. Late Design Development. Following Early Design Development, Drawings shall be prepared that incorporate a higher level of design and coordination of the Civic Square and the interface of the Civic Square with the remainder of the Property including equipment, fire protection, mechanical, electrical, structural, telecommunications, plumbing and landscaping systems through enlarged scale Drawings, detailed elevations and plans, and design mock-ups as required, to achieve an approximately sixty-five percent (65%) level of complete detail of the Civic Square and the interface of the Civic Square with the remainder of the Project (or other level of detail mutually approved by the City and Triad and representing a logical late design review point) (the "Late Design Development" phase). Drawings establishing all major elements and outline specifications shall be prepared during the Late Design Development phase. All designs and scope of work of the Project completed during Late Design Development shall be generally consistent with the Early Design Development Documents previously approved by the City.

 d. Construction Documents. The final phase for production of the Design Documents shall be the production of Construction Documents. Drawings shall be finalized and specifications for all components and systems of the Civic Square and the interface of the Civic Square with the remainder of the Project shall be completed. These Drawings (the "Construction Documents") shall provide a comprehensive, fully coordinated set of construction documents and specification to an approximately ninety-five percent (95%) level of complete detail. Construction Documents shall include a detailed construction schedule. All designs and statements regarding the scope of work of the Project completed as part of the Construction Documents shall be generally consistent with the Late Design Development.

 4.2.3. City Review. Triad shall deliver to the City copies of the Design Documents and draft plans and specifications for the Civic Elements and the interface of the Civic Square with the rest of the Project contemporaneously with their production during each phase of development of the Design Documents. Triad will inform the City and its Designated Representative of the time and place of all meetings involving Triad, the Design Team or the proposed or selected General Contractor(s) at which the design and construction of the Civic Elements and the interface of the Civic Square with the remainder of the Project is to be reviewed, and the City, or its Designated Representative may attend any such meetings. At the time Triad seeks approval of the City of the plans and specifications at the end of each phase of design development identified above, Triad shall identify in writing the Design Documents to be approved by the City and include a written notification to the City that Triad is seeking the City's approval of the Design Documents. The review periods for the review and approval of the Design Documents by City are established based upon the assumption that Triad has made available to the City the opportunity to participate in the on-going and iterative design process occurring during each phase of Design Development.

 4.2.3.1. For approvals of the Design Documents prepared for the Schematic Design and Late Design Development, the City shall have a thirty (30) day review period. For approvals of Design Documents for all other phases of design development, the City shall have a fifteen (15) day review period. Before the expiration of the applicable review period, City shall give Triad notice of City's approval or disapproval of the proposed Design Documents. If the City disapproves the proposed design, the notice shall specify City's reason for disapproval with particularity. City may only disapprove proposed designs which (1) fail to comply with any Legal Requirement, (2) fail to materially comply with the most recent set of Design Documents formally approved by the City, (3) propose material changes in the size, quality, appearance, layout or configuration of the Civic Square or interface of the Civic Square with the remainder of the Project from that previously approved by the City during the prior design phase, or (4) materially and adversely impact the construction schedule for the Civic Square. The parties acknowledge that adjustments to the Project will occur at each level of design as the designs become more detailed, and as value engineering opportunities become available, and that adjustments to designs for such reasons shall not be a basis for the City to disapprove such

 designs unless such adjustments fall within the standards for City disapproval set forth in this Section 4.2.3.1.

 4.2.4. Resubmittals. If revisions and comments are timely submitted by City in writing in accordance with the preceding Section 4.2.3, Triad shall cause the Design Team to respond to such comments which response may include making changes in the plans, Drawings and/or specifications consistent with objections or comments made by the City and Triad shall resubmit the same for further review by City. The process of resubmittal and review shall continue until City and Triad have approved the documents prepared in conjunction with the Schematic Design, Early Design Development, Late Design Development phases and the Construction Documents. The Construction Documents, as approved by the City and Triad are referred to as the "Approved Construction Documents." City approval of such documents at each stage of the design process shall be reflected in a written approval issued by the Designated Representative and referencing the approved documents.

 4.2.5. Construction Estimates and Project Redesign. At each phase of the design process and again immediately prior to closing under the Purchase and Sale Agreement, Triad shall provide to the City an estimate of the costs to construct the Civic Elements (including sales tax and a reasonable contingency for the applicable level of design, but excluding Soft Costs (as defined below (the "Triad Cost Estimate"). The City shall also be entitled to obtain at the City's cost its own estimate of the costs to construct the Civic Elements (the "City Cost Estimate"). If the Triad Cost Estimate and the City Cost Estimate differ and Triad and the City cannot agree on the cost estimate to use for purposes of this Section 4.2.5, the cost estimators for Triad and the City shall meet and discuss their respective cost estimates and the basis pursuant to which they were prepared, and then each estimator (exercising good faith) shall prepare a revised estimate. The "Cost Estimate" to be used for purposes of this Section 4.2.5 shall be (a) the Triad Cost Estimate if the City does not prepare a City Cost Estimate, (b) the cost estimate jointly approved by Triad and the City if Triad and the City both prepare a cost estimate and then mutually approved an estimate, or (c) the higher of the revised estimate prepared by the Triad cost estimator or the City cost estimator if Triad and the City both prepare a cost estimate and cannot thereafter agree on an estimate.

 In the event that at each phase of the design process and again immediately prior to Closing under the Purchase and Sale Agreement, the Cost Estimate exceeds the Construction Cost Cap (as defined in Section 5.4 below), Triad and the City, working together and in good faith, shall cause the Civic Elements to be redesigned and/or value-

 engineered and/or Civic Element features changed or revised so that the estimated costs to construct the Civic Elements do not exceed the Construction Cost Cap. The process of redesign may be undertaken as part of the design process for the next phase of Design Development, but with the understanding that the commitment of the City and Triad is to implement design changes as may be necessary to provide reasonable assurance to both Triad and the City that the construction costs for the Civic Elements will not exceed the Construction Cost Cap (unless the City agrees to increase the Construction Cost Gap as provided in Section 5.4 below).

 The Cost Estimate to be obtained immediately prior to closing under the Purchase and Sale Agreement shall be based upon a guaranteed maximum price or not-to-exceed construction cost price to be provided by the general contractor for the Civic Elements.

 Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event the closing under the Purchase and Sale Agreement has not occurred by July 30, 2009 for any reason other than a City Delay or a City-Initiated Change Order, Triad shall not have the right (unless expressly approved by the City) to seek to redesign the Civic Elements in the event the estimated costs to construct the Civic Elements exceeds the Construction Cost Cap, and Triad shall be responsible for the costs to construct the Civic Elements in excess of the Construction Cost Cap in effect as of July 30, 2009, based upon the then-existing Approved Construction Documents.

 4.2.6. Permit and Working Drawings. Triad shall cause the Design Team and other design professionals to prepare any Drawings or other documents in addition to the Construction Documents that may be

 required to be submitted for the issuance of the MUP, building Permits and other Permit applications in accordance with Section 4.4 below, and as required for development of the Project.

 4.2.7. Changes to Construction Documents. After closing under the Purchase and Sale Agreement and the commencement of the construction of the Project, changes in the Approved Construction Documents affecting the Civic Elements or the exterior appearance of the Tower may only be undertaken as part of a Change Order in accordance with the provisions of Section 5.5 below.

 4.2.8. Alternatives. In connection with the design of the Civic Elements and the permitting relating thereto, Triad may propose project features, elements and finishes for the Civic Elements which are in addition or alternative to those approved by the City pursuant to Section 4.2 (the "Alternatives"). In the budgeting and cost estimating process for the Civic Elements, the costs of the Alternatives shall be separately determined, but shall not be included within the Costs Estimates or the Construction Cost Cap. During the design approval process, approvals granted by the City may, in the City's reasonable discretion, also include approval for such Alternatives. As to any Alternative which has been approved by the City, either Triad or the City may add such Alternatives to the Civic Elements in accordance with the provisions of this Agreement.

 4.3. Design Dispute Resolution Process. City and Triad agree to follow the independent resolution process set forth in this Section 4.3 to resolve disputes regarding preparation and approval of the Schematic Designs, Design Documents, Construction Documents and changes to Approved Construction Documents in an economic and time efficient manner so that the documents conform to the requirements of this Agreement, the Development Schedule is not adversely impacted, and the Civic Elements of the Project are designed in the manner required by this Agreement.

 5.5.3. Approval of Triad-Initiated Changes; Field Orders. The City shall not unreasonably withhold or delay its consent to a Triad- Initiated Change Order, provided that the proposed Change Order (i) is minor in nature and does not affect overall appearance, safety or mechanical systems and operations of the Civic Elements, and (ii) will not result in an extension of the date by which the Civic Elements must be Substantially Complete. Triad may also add as a Triad-Initiated Change Order any of the Alternatives previously approved by the City in accordance under Section 4.2.7 above (upon notice to City but without any additional approval by the City).

 City and Triad anticipate that there will be field orders and Change Orders that will result in changes to the scope of work. Triad shall use its reasonable efforts to apprise City of proposed changes in the work and its recommendations regarding them prior to any action being taken. Triad and City anticipate that it may not always be possible for Triad to receive City's prior approval to these changes in a timely manner. Therefore, field orders and Change Orders may be approved by Triad, without prior City approval, but only if the changes authorized by these field orders and Change Orders have no material effect upon the construction or operation of the Civic Elements. As soon as practical, Triad shall provide the City with all field orders and Change Orders approved by Triad. In the case of either an alteration that will materially affect the construction or operation of the Civic Elements or a change that would result in an extension of the date by which the Civic Elements must be Substantially Completed, prior written approval by the City of the proposed change must be received. All Triad-Initiated Change Orders shall be at Triad's sole cost and expense.

 5.5.4. Approval of City-Initiated Change Orders. City- Initiated Change Orders may only be initiated by the Designated Representative. City-Initiated Change Orders may increase or decrease the scope of the Civic Elements and/or add any one or more of the Alternatives. With respect to City-Initiated Change Orders, as soon as reasonably possible after Triad's receipt of the requested Change Order, Triad will provide a detailed estimate of the effect on the Civic Square Development Cost Cap and construction time of the Civic Elements for such change order, and any associated Drawings or Permits which may be necessary together with a decision deadline for such change order to be approved or disapproved. The City shall reimburse Triad for all actual and reasonable costs incurred preparing the estimates and Drawings associated with all City- Initiated Change Orders, whether or not City accepts Triad's proposal to perform the work included in the City-Initiated Change Order. City shall approve or disapprove of the change order within five (5) business days after receipt of the cost estimate from Triad. Failure to timely approve the City-Initiated Change Orders shall be deemed disapproval. Upon receipt of City's written approval, Triad shall incorporate the City-Initiated Change Order into the work of the General Contractor. The Civic Square Development Cost Cap shall be adjusted from time to time as necessary to take into account all City-Initiated Change Orders.

 5.5.5. Costs. All costs and expenses of approved City- Initiated Change Orders as calculated in Triad's cost estimate provided to the City shall be the responsibility of the City; provided, however, the costs and expenses shall not exceed the actual costs to implement such City-Initiated Change Orders (including design costs, permitting costs and the actual charges of the contractors and subcontractors constructing such City-Initiated Change Orders). City shall pay the costs and expenses of City Initiated Change Orders as such costs and expenses are incurred.

 5.5.6. Course of Construction Dispute Resolution Process. City and Triad agree to follow the resolution process set forth in this Section 5.5.6 to resolve disputes arising during the course of construction in an economic and time efficient manner so that construction may continue in an efficient manner, the Development Schedule is not adversely impacted, and the Project is constructed in the manner required by this Agreement. City and Triad shall attempt to resolve their disputes by reasonable business-like negotiations in accordance with the following procedures, and without resort to litigation.

 a. Disputes Resolution Steps. In the event that a dispute arises between City and Triad during the construction of the Project as to the responsibility as between City and Triad for any costs or schedule delays associated with any Project Element or compliance of Project features with the terms of this Agreement and the Approved Construction Documents, the Parties first shall proceed in good faith to resolve such dispute as expeditiously as possible and shall cooperate so that the progress of the construction of the Project is not delayed. If a dispute arises, City or Triad may call a special meeting ("Special Meeting") for the resolution of that dispute. The Special Meeting shall be held at the Project site within a reasonable time not to exceed five (5) days of a written request for the meeting, which request shall specify the nature of the dispute to be resolved. The Special Meeting shall be attended by non-attorney representatives of City and Triad, who shall attempt in good faith to resolve the dispute and have authority sufficient to do so.

 b. If the representatives are unable to resolve the dispute, a senior representative from City and Triad each shall review the dispute in detail and then meet face-to-face to discuss and resolve the matter. This meeting of senior representatives (the "Senior Meeting") shall occur no later than three (3) Business Days after the meeting of the project representatives have declared an impasse in their efforts to resolve the dispute, unless the parties agree upon a longer period of time. The parties shall promptly designate a senior representative for purposes of this Section. Any party may, if necessary, designate a different senior representative at any time during the course of the Project. This meeting shall be for the express purpose of: (1) exchanging and reviewing all pertinent non- privileged documents and information relating to the matters and issues in dispute; (2) freely and candidly discussing each party's position; and (3) reaching agreement upon a reasonable, compromise resolution of the claim.

 c. If the dispute has not been resolved within five (5) Business Days of the Senior Meeting, any party thereto may, at its option, initiate mediation proceedings. These proceedings shall be conducted by an impartial third-party mediator who is acceptable to all of the parties to the mediation and experienced in design and construction in Washington on projects of similar type and scope. The mediator shall be given written statement(s) of the parties and may inspect the Project site and other documents. The mediator shall schedule a mediation to be attended by City and Triad within a reasonable time of its selection. This meeting shall be attended by representatives of City and Triad with authority sufficient to resolve the dispute. The cost of the mediation shall be borne equally by the parties to the dispute. No minutes shall be kept and the proceeding shall be confidential and not admissible except as provided below. The entire mediation process must be completed within ten (10) Business Days of the Special Meeting, unless all parties involved in the dispute extend the mediation period. If, as a result of the mediation, a negotiated settlement is reached, the parties agree that such settlement shall be reduced to writing.

 5.6. Delays.

 5.6.1. Unavoidable Delay. The existence of Unavoidable Delays shall excuse Triad for resulting delays and changes in the Development Schedule.

 5.6.2. City Delay. City shall be responsible for all costs incurred by Triad as a result of City Delay. Triad shall notify City in writing of the occurrence of any City Delay and shall provide a statement of any damages or costs incurred as a result of City Delay on a timely basis and prior to Substantial Completion. As used in this Agreement, "City Delay" shall mean one or more of the following which cause a delay of the Substantial Completion Date:

 a. City's failure to timely supply information necessary to complete the Design Documents (or revisions to such Drawings); or

 b. City's request for new work involving work not identified in the Approved Construction Documents; or

 c. City-Initiated Change Orders.

 All costs incurred by Triad caused by City Delay will be the responsibility of City. City Delay shall not include any delay in the completion of the Project caused by the lawful, normal and customary enforcement of building, health and safety codes, ordinances and regulations applicable to the Project.

 5.7. Right to Accelerate Closing and Complete. At any time following substantial completion of the Garage (as such term is customarily used in the construction industry), if the Civic Elements will not be completed in accordance with the Development Schedule and Triad is not proceeding with diligence and in good faith to seek to complete the Civic Elements, the City may give Triad written notice of the City's intention to elect to accelerate the Closing Date on which the City shall acquire the Civic Square Parcel (a "Pre- Acceleration Notice"). If within thirty (30) days following the date of such Pre-Acceleration Notice Triad does not provide to the City reasonable evidence that Triad is proceeding diligently and in good faith to complete the Civic Elements, the City may give Triad written notice of the City's election to accelerate the Closing Date (an "Acceleration Notice"). The Acceleration Notice shall state a date on which the City intends to complete the acquisition of the Civic Square Parcel, which date shall not be earlier than ninety (90) days following the date on which the Acceleration Notice is given. On the date specified in the Acceleration Notice for the acquisition of the Civic Square Parcel, Triad shall convey the Civic Square Parcel to the City in the manner and upon the conditions described in Section 9 below. Following the acquisition of the Civic Square Parcel pursuant to the Acceleration Notice, the City shall have the right to possession of the Civic Square Parcel and may undertake whatever action is reasonable and necessary to complete the Civic Elements. Further, City shall thereupon be entitled to draw upon the Letter of Credit (up to the full amount thereof) to the extent required to pay for all reasonable and necessary Development Costs incurred in completion of the Civic Elements. To the extent the funds payable to the City pursuant to the Letter of Credit are not sufficient to pay the reasonable and necessary Development Costs of completing the Civic Elements, Triad shall reimburse the City for all Development Costs reasonably and necessarily incurred in the completion of the Civic Elements in excess of the amounts the City would have been responsible for pursuant to the terms of this Agreement had Triad completed the Civic Elements. Any such reimbursements shall be due within thirty (30) days following written demand by City, which demand shall include a statement of the completion costs incurred by the City in reasonable detail. In the event the City acquires the Civic Square Parcel pursuant to an Acceleration Notice as set forth in this paragraph, the City shall thereupon grant Triad a temporary construction easement in a form reasonably acceptable to both Parties (which shall contain customary indemnities in favor of the City) for the purpose of permitting Triad or its successor to utilize the Civic Square Parcel for staging of construction equipment necessary to complete construction of the Project excluding the Civic Elements. To the extent the Civic Square Parcel has not been created prior to any conveyance to be made under this paragraph, the parties hereby covenant to take all action necessary to create the Civic Square

 Parcel as set forth in Section 6. Any disputes between the parties with respect to the right of the City to issue an Acceleration Notice, and any disputes between the parties with respect to the terms of the construction easement shall be subject to the arbitration process set forth in Section 5.5.6 above; provided, however, the City shall be entitled to an decree of specific performance from the King County Superior Court to enforce any properly given Acceleration Notice.

 5.8. Indemnity. The Parties specifically and expressly agree that, to the fullest extent permitted by law, Triad shall indemnify, defend and hold harmless the City, and its officers, officials, employees, and agents (individually each an "Indemnified Party" and collective the "Indemnified Parties"), from and against any and all claims, liability, damages, losses and causes of actions, arising out of or resulting from, or alleged to arise out of or to result from, the performance of the construction of the Civic Elements (hereinafter singularly and collectively referred to as "Indemnity Claims"), provided that such Indemnity Claim is attributable to bodily injury, sickness, disease or death, or to injury to or destruction of tangible property (other than the work of the Project itself), but only to the extent directly or indirectly caused by the negligence of willful misconduct of Triad, its officers, employees, agents, and/or subcontractors of all tiers (individually each an "Indemnified Party" and collectively the "Indemnified Parties"). Triad shall defend all lawsuits, arbitration proceedings and similar proceedings filed against an Indemnified Party in connection therewith, and reimburse each Indemnified Party for all reasonable expenses incurred by such Indemnified Party in connection with Indemnity Claims and lawsuits, arbitration proceedings and similar proceedings, including but not limited to attorney fees, expert witness fees, court costs, arbitration costs and all other reasonable costs (not limited to statutory costs). The Parties specifically and expressly agree that if Indemnity Claims are caused or alleged to be caused in part by any joint or concurrent negligent act (either active or passive) or omission by an Indemnified Party, Triad shall indemnify, defend and hold harmless such Indemnified Party, as provided above, from such Indemnity Claims to the extent such Indemnity Claims arise out of or result from the negligence or willful misconduct of Triad or its officers, employees, agents, and/or subcontractors of all tiers. In no event shall Triad be obligated to indemnify an Indemnified Party for Indemnity Claims which arise out of or result from the sole negligence of such Indemnified Party or its agents, servants or independent contractors who are directly responsible to such Indemnified Party, excluding Triad herein. Triad's obligations under this Section shall include, but not be limited to:

 5.8.1. The duty to promptly accept tender of defense and provide defense to City at Triad's own expense;

 5.8.2. The duty to indemnify and defend City from any claim, demand, and/or cause of action brought by or on behalf of any of Triad's officers, employees or agents. The foregoing duty is specifically and expressly intended to constitute a waiver of Triad's immunity under Washington's Industrial Insurance Act, RCW Title 51, as respects City only, with a full and complete indemnity and defense of claims made by Triad's officers, employees and agents. The Parties acknowledge that these provisions were mutually negotiated and agreed upon by them.

 In the event City incurs any judgment, award, and/or costs arising therefrom, including attorneys fees, to enforce the provisions of this Section, all such reasonable fees, expenses, and costs shall be recoverable from Triad. Notwithstanding the provisions contained in this Section above, Triad's obligation to indemnify City shall not extend to any claim, demand or cause of action arising or in connection with the gross negligence, intentional acts or breach of this Agreement by City.

 5.9. Insurance During Construction. By the date of closing under the Purchase and Sale Agreement, Triad shall procure and maintain or cause the General Contractor to procure and maintain, at a minimum, for the duration of the Project the following insurance against claims for injuries to persons or damages to property which may arise from, or in connection with the performance of work hereunder by Triad, its agents, representatives, employees and/or contractors. The cost of such insurance shall be paid by Triad or its contractors. Coverage shall be at least as broad as:

 5.9.1. Property insurance insuring all equipment, trade fixtures, inventory, fixtures and other personal property located on or in the Property ("Insured Personalty") for perils covered by the cause of loss - special form (or the equivalent ISO form in use from time to time in the state where the Property is located), or, during construction, perils typically covered under a so-called "builder's risk" policy of insurance. Such insurance shall be written on a replacement cost basis in an amount equal to the full insurable value of the aggregate of the Improvements, without coinsurance and with an agreed amount endorsement to prevent co-insurance.

 5.9.2. General Liability: Insurance Services Office form number GC 00 01 or equivalent covering Commercial General Liability ("CGL Policy"), with a limit of not less than; $5,000,000 combined single limit per occurrence, $5,000,000 aggregate.

 5.9.3. Automobile Liability: Insurance Services Office form number CA 00 01 or equivalent covering Business Automobile Liability, with a limit of not less than $1,000,000 combined single limit per occurrence.

 5.9.4. Workers' Compensation: Workers' Compensation coverage, as required by the Industrial Insurance Act of the State of Washington, statutory limits.

 5.9.5. General Requirements.

 5.9.5.1. The policies required to be or otherwise maintained by Triad or its General Contractor shall be issued by companies rated A (X) or better in the most current issue of Best's Insurance Reports. Insurers shall be admitted insurers in the State of Washington, and domiciled in the USA.

 5.9.5.2. Certified copies of the policies or a binder (ACORD 13) followed before expiration of the binder by a copy of the declarations page(s) of the policy with a schedule of all endorsements, shall be delivered to City with ten (10) days following the Effective Date and annually thereafter at least thirty (30) days prior to the expiration date of the old policy. Such forms shall indicate applicable deductibles, retention, coverage and sub-limits of coverage and shall contain an endorsement each of the insurance companies named thereon adding any additional insured party(ies) required herein.

 5.9.5.3. Each policy of insurance required to be or otherwise maintained by Triad shall name the City as an additional insured and provide written notification to City and any other additional insured party at least thirty (30) days prior to any cancellation or modification to reduce the insurance coverage.

 5.9.6. Failure to Provide. In the event Triad does not purchase the insurance required by this Agreement or keep the same in full force and effect, City may, but shall not be obligated to purchase the required insurance or such lesser alternative insurance coverage as City may elect, and pay the premium therefor. Triad shall repay to City the amount so paid promptly upon demand plus an administrative fee of 15% of such premium. In addition, City may recover from Triad and Triad agrees to pay any and all reasonable expenses (including attorneys' fee) and damages which City may sustain by reason of the failure of Triad to obtain and maintain such insurance and/or efforts to obtain same from Triad or from other sources.

 5.9.7. Waiver of Claims. Triad waives and releases its right of recovery against City, and against the elected officials, officers, employees, agents, contractors, subcontractors, tenants and subtenants of City, directly or by way of subrogation or otherwise, for any claim, and for any loss of, or damage to, Triad's property, any of Triad's business or operations and/or any personal injury to the extent that such claim, loss, damage or injury results from a cause of loss which is covered by any property or CGL Policy actually maintained by a party or which would have been covered by any property or CGL Policy required pursuant to the terms of this Agreement to be in effect at the time of such loss, damage or injury. Subject to any limitations on such amounts set forth in this section, such waiver or release shall include any deductible, retention and self insured loss or damage. Such waiver or release shall be effective without regard to whether such required policy was in effect and without regard to the availability of coverage or limits of liability under any such policy. Triad shall obtain any special endorsements required by its insurer to allow such waiver of rights of subrogation but the failure to obtain same shall not impair the effectiveness of this waiver and/or release between City and Triad. Any cost for a special endorsement shall be paid for by Triad.

 5.10. Security for Performance. To secure Triad's performance under this Agreement, Triad shall provide to the City a letter of credit issued by a national bank or other credit-based issuer reasonably acceptable to City (the "Letter of Credit") in the amount of $35,000,000.00 which shall be reduced: (i) upon substantial completion of the Garage (as such term is customarily used in the construction industry), to $27,500,000; and (ii) following the commencement of construction of the Civic Elements, on a monthly basis, to one hundred ten percent (110%) of the then estimated costs to complete construction of the Civic Elements to Substantial Completion. It is anticipated that if Triad provides the Letter of Credit, it will be issued by the construction lender for the Civic Elements or equity investor in the Project and the Letter of Credit may be reduced on a monthly basis pursuant to clause (ii) above as Triad incurs costs associated with the construction of the Civic Elements such that at all times following commencement of construction of the Civic Elements the amount available under the Letter of Credit shall be equal to one hundred ten percent (110%) of the then estimated costs to complete the Civic Elements.

 5.11. Monitoring and Management of Construction. Triad and its contractors and subcontractors shall supervise and manage the design, development and construction of the Project. City shall have the right to review and approve designs, Drawings and pricing for the Civic Elements and revisions thereto in accordance with the provisions of Section 4.2 above. The City and its Designative Representative shall be provided with completed and detailed contractor pricing during the four (4) phases of Document Design. Notwithstanding the foregoing, City shall have no supervisory authority over the construction of any element of the Project and its participation in any design or construction related activity shall be for the sole purpose of monitoring the progress of the Project and the construction of the Civic Elements, and the Project for all purposes shall be a privately designed, constructed and financed Project.

 5.12. Disclaimer. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement to the contrary, City is under no obligation to, nor shall it construct or supervise the construction of the Project. It is understood and agreed that City's right to inspect the Civic Elements is for the sole purpose of protecting City's rights as a vendee under this Agreement. Except as otherwise provided herein, no part of the cost of construction of the Project shall ever become an obligation of City. City is not responsible to any contractors or to any subcontractors under any subcontracts for design, development, repair, renovation or construction of the Project or any other third parties for any purpose whatsoever. Nothing contained in this Agreement shall be construed as the consent or request of City, express or implied, for the performance of any labor or services or for the furnishing of any materials or equipment for any construction, alteration, addition, repair or demolition of or to the Property (or any part thereof). Triad shall include in the construction contracts and the contracts for architectural and engineering services the following or substantive equivalent disclaimer: NOTICE IS HEREBY GIVEN THAT THE CITY OF SEATTLE WILL NOT BE LIABLE FOR ANY LABOR, SERVICES, MATERIALS OR EQUIPMENT FURNISHED OR TO BE FURNISHED TO TRIAD, OR ANYONE HOLDING AN INTEREST IN THE PROPERTY (OR ANY PART THEREOF) THROUGH OR UNDER TRIAD, AND THAT NO CONSTRUCTION OR OTHER LIENS FOR ANY SUCH LABOR, SERVICES, MATERIALS OR EQUIPMENT SHALL ATTACH TO OR AFFECT THE INTEREST OF CITY IN THE PROPERTY.

 5.13. Construction of Civic Square. Triad shall, at its sole cost and expense, design, develop and manage the construction of the Civic Square in accordance with the Approved Construction Documents and the Development Schedule. City acknowledges that Triad may, subject to City's approval, in the course of discharging its construction responsibilities enter into a single construction contract with a contractor for construction of the entire Project, or enter into a series of construction contract(s) for various Elements of the Project including a separate construction contract for the Civic Elements as Triad may determine necessary after taking into consideration availability of labor, materials, weather, permitting restrictions, progress of overall design and development and other construction-related factors. City further acknowledges that due to the nature of the Project, the Project may be constructed in stages, with the Garage and Tower constructed first and prior to construction of the Civic Elements. In the event Triad constructs the Civic Elements prior to constructing other elements of the Project, Triad shall be fully responsible to repair any damage to the Civic Elements caused by any construction staging.

 5.14. Oversight. In consultation with the Design Team, Triad shall oversee the course of construction and shall conduct such inspections of the course of construction and testing of work related to the Civic Elements to insure that the work of each contractor is being performed in substantial accordance with the requirements of the Approval Construction Documents, Legal Requirements, in a good and workmanlike manner, free of defects and deficiencies in work not inherent in the quality required or permitted under the Approved Construction Documents, and free and clear of all liens. Triad shall reject all work which does not substantially conform to the requirements of the Approved Construction Documents and cause

 corrective action to be taken (unless the City has previously given Triad a written acceptance of the condition). Triad shall record the progress of the Civic Elements and shall cause the contractors performing work on the Civic Elements to submit written monthly progress reports to Triad and City, including information on each Contractor and each Contractor's work, as it relates to the Civic Elements, showing percentages of completion both in terms of cost incurred and physical construction. Triad shall maintain or cause each such contractor to maintain a daily log, containing a record of weather, each Contractor's work on the site, number of workers, identification of equipment, work accomplished, problems encountered and such other information as City reasonably may require. All of the records required under this Section 5.14 shall be made available to the City and its Designated Representative as required by this Agreement. If the City or its Designated Representative makes any objections concerning any aspect of the Project during construction, such objections shall be in writing and shall be solely for the purpose of protecting the City's rights under this Agreement to receive the Civic Elements in the condition and upon the schedule set forth in this Agreement. Triad shall respond to any written objections so made within five (5) business days so that the Parties may determine as soon as possible whether either Party has any claim that work is not in compliance with this Agreement.

 5.15. Substantial Completion of Civic Elements. The Civic Elements shall be "Substantially Complete" and the "Substantial Completion Date" shall be the date upon which the following events have occurred with respect to the Civic Elements:

 5.15.1. Notice to City. Triad shall have notified City in writing that the Civic Elements are substantially completed in substantial accordance with the Approved Construction Documents (inclusive of any Change Orders);

 5.15.2. Contractor Certification. Each Contractor providing construction services with respect to the Civic Elements has issued its "Certificate of Substantial Completion."

 5.15.3. Architect's Certification. Architect has issued its "Certificate of Substantial Completion" AIA Document G704, stating that the Civic Elements are sufficiently complete in substantial accordance with the Approved Construction Documents to permit the City to occupy or utilize the Civic Elements.

 5.15.4. Certificate of Occupancy. City has issued a temporary certificate of occupancy for all of the Civic Elements (which may be the certificate of occupancy for the entire Project if a certificate of occupancy is not separately available for the Civic Elements, and which may be a shell and core certificate of occupancy for the Civic Square Retail Space until the Tenant Improvements for such space have been installed).

 5.15.5. Triad Acceptance. Triad has accepted the Civic Elements and the Garage as substantially complete subject to completion of normal punch-list items

 5.15.6. City Acceptance. City has accepted the Civic Elements as substantially complete, subject to completion of normal punch list items, in accordance under the provisions of Section 5.16 below.

 5.15.7. Removal of Staging. All staging, material storage and other items that may be related to the use of the Civic Square as a staging area for the construction of the Tower shall have been removed, and the Civic Square is in a neat, clear and fully functionally condition (storage and staging may continue to occur in the Garage).

 Within ninety (90) days following Substantial Completion, Triad shall also provide to the City an Affidavit of Payment of Debts and Claims (AIA Forms 706 and 706A) from each general contractor and final waivers and releases of liens in form satisfactory to Triad from the principal subcontractors and suppliers. Also following Substantial Completion, Triad shall proceed diligently to complete the work necessary to obtain a final certificate of occupancy for the Civic Elements.

 5.16. Notice of Substantial Completion; Punchlist. Triad shall give notice to City and the Designated Representative at least thirty (30) days prior to the date which Triad anticipates the Civic Elements will be Substantially Complete. During the 15-day period after such notice, Triad, City, the Designated Representative, and the general contractor shall meet and inspect the Civic Elements and determine if the Civic Elements are Substantially Complete. In the event the parties dispute whether or not the Civic Elements are Substantially Complete, such dispute shall be subject to arbitration in accordance with Section 4.3 above.

 During the inspections noted above, the parties shall also prepare a punchlist (as such term is used generally in the construction industry) of the items requiring to be repaired or completed with respect to the Civic Elements. The preparation of the punchlist shall not be required in order for the Civic Elements to be Substantially Complete, provided the standards for Substantial

 Completion set forth above have been met. Triad shall correct all punchlist items promptly and in accordance with the Approved Construction Documents. The costs to complete those punchlist items which are not completed as of the date of the Civic Square Closing shall be escrowed in a holdback in accordance with the provisions of Section 9 below.

 5.17. Construction Representations; Warranties. Upon Substantial Completion of the Civic Elements, Triad shall represent and warrant to City as follows:

The Civic Elements have been completed in substantial accordance with the Approved Construction Documents (inclusive of any Change Orders), and the materials and equipment furnished are of good quality and new unless otherwise required or permitted by the Approved Construction Documents, and the work is free from defects in workmanship and materials in connection with the construction thereof not inherent in the quality required or permitted under the Approved Construction Documents. Triad's warranty excludes remedy for damage or defect caused by abuse, modifications not executed by Triad, improper or insufficient maintenance, improper operation, or normal wear and tear and normal usage. Triad shall also assign to City at the Civic Square Closing on a non-exclusive basis all express and implied warranties made or assigned at any time to Triad by any contractors or subcontractors or material suppliers relating to the Civic Elements, with Triad reserving the right to enforce such warranties in connection with other elements of the Project and/or in connection with any warranty claims made by City against Triad under this Agreement.

 5.17.2. Notwithstanding the foregoing, City acknowledges and agrees that Triad will not independently warrant any aspect of the materials, equipment and construction work and City shall instead solely rely upon the assigned warranties of Triad's contractors or subcontractors or material suppliers with respect to the portions/aspects of the Civic Elements identified in Schedule 5.17 attached hereto.

 5.17.3. Triad has no knowledge of any structural defects, latent defects or building systems defects within the Civic Elements.

Triad hereby agrees to execute such documents as are reasonably requested by City to evidence rescission of the Purchase and Sale Agreement and re-conveyance of the Property in the event of termination of this Agreement pursuant to this paragraph.

 5.19. Survival. All of the obligations of Triad under this Section 5 shall survive the transfer of the Civic Square Parcel.

 6. Conveyance of the Civic Square Parcel.

For purposes hereof, the Actual Development Costs shall be the sum of (i) the actual costs incurred by Triad with respect to the construction and development of the Civic Elements (based upon those costs customarily included within construction cost budgets routinely used in the construction industry (i.e., the construction cost categories included within the Construction Cost Cap as set forth in the last paragraph of Section 5.4), but excluding Soft Costs, plus (ii) an amount equal to ten percent (10%) of the amount set forth in (i) above as a Soft Costs allowance. At the Civic Square Closing, the promissory note made by Triad in favor of the City pursuant to Section 2(a)(iv) of the Purchase and Sale Agreement shall also be returned to Triad marked "paid in full." If the sum of the Actual Development Costs and the Contribution Value are less than the amount due under the promissory note, Triad shall pay the remaining amount due to the City under such promissory note at the Civic Square Closing.

If any revenue or expense amount cannot be ascertained with certainty as of the Civic Square Transfer Date, it shall be prorated on the basis of the parties' reasonable estimates of such amounts, and shall be the subject of a final proration sixty (60) days after Closing or as soon thereafter as the precise amounts can be ascertained. Either party owing the other party a sum of money based on adjustments made to the prorations after the Civic Square Transfer Date shall promptly pay that sum together with interest thereon at the rate of twelve (12%) per annum from the date of demand therefor to the date of payment if payment is not made within ten (10) days after the delivery of a statement therefor.

 9.6. Costs and Expenses. Triad shall pay the premium for the Title Policy and all real estate excise taxes, if any, applicable to the transfer of the Civic Square Parcel. The escrow fee shall be borne equally by Triad and City. City shall pay all recording costs.

On the Civic Square Transfer Date, the Escrow Holder shall record the deed to the Civic Square Parcel and the REA in the real property records of King County, Washington and deliver the Title Policy to City. Escrow Holder shall deliver copies of all documents executed, delivered and/or recorded in connection with this transaction to both Triad and City, together with closing statements in form customarily prepared by Escrow Holder within five (5) days following the Civic Square Transfer Date.

 10. Default.

 10.1. Remedies; Waiver of Consequential Damages. If either party defaults in the performance of its obligations under this Agreement and such default continues for a period of fifteen (15) days (with respect to a default related to the payment of money) or sixty (60) days (with respect to a default with respect to an obligation other than the payment of money), the non-defaulting party may seek any and all remedies provided by law or in equity, limited however to actual damages only. Triad and the City waive claims against each other for consequential damages arising out of or relating to this Agreement (which waiver includes, without limitation, damages incurred for loss of use, income, profit, financing, business and/or reputation, loss of management or employee productivity or of the services of such persons. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the liquidated damages set forth in Section 10.3.1 below shall be the sole remedy of the City against Triad if Triad defaults prior to the reduction of the amount of the Letter of Credit, and the liquidated damages set forth in Section 10.3.3 below shall be the sole remedy of the City against Triad with respect to late delivery of the Civic Square Parcel. In the event Triad defaults in its obligations to complete the Civic Elements following the conveyance of the Civic Square Parcel to the City, the City may draw upon the Letter of Credit to pay the costs incurred by the City in completing the Civic Elements.

 10.2. Default by City. In the event the City defaults in the acquisition of the Civic Square Parcel, the remedies of Triad under this Agreement shall include, at the option of Triad, the right to seek specific performance of this Agreement. In this respect, the Parties acknowledge that the Civic Square Parcel and the improvements to be constructed thereon are unique, have been designed for a limited use as a civic square, and that a remedy of actual damages will not adequately compensate Triad for the City's failure to acquire the Civic Square Parcel in accordance with the terms of this Agreement.

 10.3. Liquidated Damages. If Triad fails to complete the conveyance of the Civic Square Parcel in a timely manner as required by this Agreement (for reasons other than Unavoidable Delays and City Delays), the damages to be suffered by City are difficult, if not impossible to calculate, such damages including, but not limited to, the time and effort required of City employees arising from such default, the delay of the availability of a significant public space to the general public of City, and the adverse impact on adjacent property owned by City.

 10.3.1. A good faith estimate of damages incurred by the City is $35,000,000.00 if Triad defaults in its obligations under this Agreement prior to the reduction in the amount of the Letter of Credit, and it is the intention of the Parties that the $35,000,000.00 proceeds from the Letter of Credit shall be the sole damages paid to the City in such event (and with the proceeds of such Letter of Credit also satisfying the obligations of Triad under the promissory note made by Triad in favor of the City pursuant to Section 2(a)(iv) of the Purchase and Sale Agreement).

 10.3.2. A good faith estimate of damages incurred by the City if completion of the Civic Elements does not occur within four (4) months following the estimated date of Substantial Completion established in the Development Schedule approved by Triad and the City prior to the commencement of construction (for reasons other than Unavoidable Delays or City Delays) are: (i) $1,000 for each day of delay for the first thirty (30) days; (ii) $2,000 for each day of delay for the next thirty (30) days of delay and (iii) $4,000 per day for each day of delay thereafter until the Civic Elements are completed. The amount of damages owed under this Section 10.3.2 shall be paid by Triad to City on the Civic Square Transfer Date. City may apply any amount due from Triad under this Section 10.3.2 toward the satisfaction of City's obligation to pay any amounts due from City to Triad on the Civic Square Transfer Date.

Routine maintenance and repairs shall be undertaken at such times and in such manner as to not interfere with the operation of the Garage. Operation of the water features shall be as provided in the O&M Plan and/or Master Lease.

 F. Loading Zone; Garbage Collection.

 ARTICLE3

 PREMISES AND DELIVERY OF POSSESSION

 3.1 Delivery of Possession

 . Landlord shall use commercially reasonable efforts to deliver possession of Premises on or before the anticipated Possession Date.

 3.2 Commencement Date

 . Once the Commencement Date is fixed, within ten (10) days following request by either party, the other party will execute and deliver to the requesting party a certificate substantially in the form of Exhibit C attached hereto and made a part hereof, confirming the actual Commencement Date and noting thereon any exceptions thereto that may exist at that time.

 3.3 Size of Premises

 . The rentable area of the Premises will be deemed for all purposes to be as set forth on the Lease Summary, subject to remeasurement as provided for therein.

 ARTICLE4

 RENT

 Tenant agrees to pay to Landlord all Rent payable hereunder, without set-off or deduction, in lawful money of the United States of America. Tenant shall pay the Rent as follows:

 4.1 Minimum Rent

 . Tenant shall pay to Landlord the Minimum Rent without notice or demand except as otherwise provided herein, in installments due and payable in advance on the first day of each calendar month during the Term. In the event of any fractional calendar month, Tenant shall pay for each day in such partial month a rental equal to 1/30 of the Minimum Rent. Concurrent with the execution of this Lease, Tenant will deliver to Landlord the first month's Minimum Rent.

 4.2 Taxes Payable by Tenant

 . Tenant and/or Sub-Tenants shall pay (a) all Taxes levied upon, measured by, or reasonably attributable to the cost or value of Tenant's Property or Sub-Tenant's Property and (b) all Taxes levied upon any Sublease creating or transferring an interest or an estate in the Premises and the rents derived thereunder and (c) the statutory leasehold excise tax due on the Rent payable by Tenant hereunder.

 4.3 Place of Payment

 . All Rent shall be paid at the Landlord's Address for Payment set forth on the Lease Summary or at such other place as Landlord may designate.

 4.4 Interest and Late Charges

 . If Tenant fails to pay any Rent when due, after giving effect to any applicable grace periods, the unpaid amounts shall bear interest at the Interest Rate. Tenant acknowledges that the late payment of any Rent will cause Landlord to incur costs and expenses not contemplated under this Lease, including, without limitation, administrative and collection costs and processing and accounting expenses, the exact amount of which is extremely difficult to ascertain. Therefore, in addition to interest, if any such payment is not received by Landlord within five (5) days from when due, Tenant shall pay Landlord a late charge equal to three percent (3%) of such payment, plus any reasonable attorneys' fees incurred by Landlord by reason of Tenant's failure to pay Rent when due; provided that the foregoing late charges shall not be imposed with respect to the first instance of late payment in any calendar year. Landlord and Tenant agree that this late charge represents a reasonable estimate of such costs and expenses and is fair compensation to Landlord for loss resulting from Tenant's nonpayment. The late charge shall be deemed Additional Rent and the right to require it shall be in addition to all of Landlord's other rights and remedies hereunder or at law and shall not be construed as liquidated damages or as limiting Landlord's remedies in any manner. In addition, any check returned by the bank for any reason will be considered late and will be subject to all late charges, plus a Fifty Dollar ($50.00) fee. After two (2) returned checks in any twelve (12) month period, Landlord will have the right to receive payment by a cashier's check or money order. Nothing contained herein shall be construed as to compel Landlord to accept any payment of Rent in arrears or late charges should Landlord elect to apply its rights and remedies available under this Lease or at law or in equity in the event of a Default.

 ARTICLE5

 USE

 5.1 Permitted Use

 . Tenant and all Sub-Tenants may use the Premises solely for the Permitted Use as shown on the Lease Summary, and for no other purpose without Landlord's consent. No portion of the Premises may be used for any of the uses prohibited by any recorded Reciprocal Easement Agreement ("REA") to which the Civic Square Parcel is subject. No second-hand, auction, fire, distress or bankruptcy sales may be conducted at the Premises. Sub-Tenants' sales practices shall be in accord with standards and practices generally acceptable in first-class retail or public market centers. In any action brought to enforce the foregoing, Landlord shall be entitled to mandatory injunctive relief in addition to other legal and equitable damages and remedies. Tenant hereby agrees that Landlord has standing to enforce the foregoing provisions against any Sub-Tenant.

 5.2 Compliance

 . Tenant and all Sub-Tenants shall comply with all recorded covenants, conditions, and restrictions, including without limitation the REA, now or hereafter affecting the Civic Square Parcel. Tenant shall not do or permit anything to be done in or about the Premises that would in any way obstruct or interfere with the rights of other occupants or invitees of the Civic Square Parcel; injure, annoy or interfere with the business of any other occupants of the Premises or the Civic Square Parcel or any of their invitees; or cause, maintain, or permit any nuisance or waste at the Premises or the Civic Square Parcel.

 5.3 Compliance with Law

 . Tenant has been provided an opportunity to inspect the Premises to a degree sufficient to determine whether or not the same, in their condition as of the date hereof, violate any applicable Law. Tenant further acknowledges and agrees that, except as may otherwise be specifically provided in this Lease, Landlord has made no representation or warranty as to whether the Premises conform to the requirements of Law. Tenant shall be responsible for compliance of the Premises with applicable Law and shall bear all costs necessary to maintain the Premises in compliance with Law, including structural work, if any. Tenant shall also be responsible for the cost of any alterations to other portions of the Civic Square Parcel which are necessitated by any alterations to the Premises or any change in use of the Premises. Tenant shall not use, occupy or permit the Premises to be used or occupied in violation of any Law or the certificate of occupancy issued for the Premises and shall, upon notice from Landlord, immediately discontinue any use of the Premises that is declared by any governmental authority having jurisdiction to be a violation of Law or the certificate of occupancy. Should any obligation be imposed by Law, then Tenant agrees, at its sole cost and expense, to comply promptly with such obligations to the extent the same relate to the Premises or the Civic Square Parcel.

 5.4 Effect on Landlord's Insurance

 . Tenant shall not do or permit to be done anything that will invalidate or increase the cost of any property coverage, or other insurance policy covering the Premises, the Civic Square Parcel or any property located therein. Tenant shall promptly, upon demand, reimburse Landlord for any additional premium charged for such policy by reason of Tenant's failure to comply with the provisions of this Section.

 5.5 Transportation Management

 . Tenant shall comply with all present or future programs intended to manage parking, transportation or traffic in and around the Civic Square Parcel, and in connection therewith, Tenant shall take responsible action for the transportation planning and management of all employees located at the Premises by working directly with Landlord, any governmental transportation management organization or any other transportation-related committees or entities.

 5.6 Use of Civic Square Parcel

 . Use of the Civic Square Parcel by any Tenant Related Parties shall at all times be subject to the Rules and Regulations set forth in Exhibit E.

 ARTICLE6

 HAZARDOUS MATERIALS

 6.1 Indemnity

 . Tenant shall defend, indemnify and hold harmless all Landlord Related Parties from and against all claims, suits, demands, response costs, contribution costs, liabilities, losses, or damages (including, without limitation, reasonable attorneys' fees), directly or indirectly arising out of the existence, use generation, migration, storage, transportation, release, threatened release, or disposal of Hazardous Materials in, on, or under the Tower Parcel or the Premises or in the groundwater under the Tower Parcel or the Premises, to the extent that any of the foregoing is caused by any Tenant Related Parties. This indemnity extends to the costs incurred by any Landlord Related Party to repair, clean-up, dispose of, or remove such Hazardous Materials in order to comply with the Environmental Laws; provided that if Tenant is not otherwise in Default, Landlord shall give Tenant not less than thirty (30) days' advance notice of Landlord's intention to incur such costs.

 6.2 Restriction on Hazardous Materials

 . Except as specifically permitted in Section 6.4 below, Tenant shall not permit any Tenant Related Parties to use, generate, manufacture, store, transport, release, threaten release, or dispose of Hazardous Materials in, on, about or across the Premises, the Civic Square Parcel or the Tower Parcel or transport Hazardous Materials from the Premises unless Tenant shall have received Landlord's prior consent therefor, which Landlord may revoke at any time upon reasonable prior notice. Tenant Related Parties shall not cause or permit the release or disposal of Hazardous Materials from the Premises except in compliance with applicable Environmental Laws. Tenant shall promptly deliver notice to Landlord if Tenant obtains knowledge sufficient to infer that Hazardous Materials are located within any portion of the Premises that are not in compliance with applicable Environmental Laws or if any third party, including without limitation, any governmental agency, claims a significant disposal of Hazardous Materials has occurred, is being released from, or has been released from any portion of the Civic Square Parcel or the Tower Parcel.

 6.3 Investigation of Contamination

 . If Landlord has a good faith belief that a release of Hazardous Materials that comes within the scope of Tenant's indemnification and hold harmless obligations as set forth above has occurred, or is threatened to occur, on or about the Premises Landlord, through its appropriately qualified and licensed professional engineers, may investigate the Premises and Tenant shall permit all required access to the Premises as is necessary in order to permit Landlord's engineer to perform such investigation. If Landlord's investigation reveals that a release of Hazardous Materials has occurred, or if a release of Hazardous Materials would have occurred but for Landlord's investigation, Tenant shall promptly (i) reimburse Landlord for all costs associated with such investigation, and (ii) using duly licensed and insured contractors approved by Landlord, commence and diligently complete the removal, repair, clean-up, and detoxification of any Hazardous Materials from the Premises as may be required by applicable Environmental Laws.

 6.4 Landlord Consent

 . During the Term of this Lease, Tenant or any Sub-Tenant may use or sell (or may sublease or assign this Lease or any portion of the Premises to a Sub-Tenant or assignee who uses or sells) Hazardous Materials commonly found or sold in retail stores without Landlord's consent, so long as i. such substances be of the type customarily used in retail spaces and are used and maintained only in such quantities as are reasonably necessary for the Permitted Use and in strict accordance with applicable Environmental Laws and manufacturer instructions therefor; ii. such substances shall not be disposed of, released or discharged from any portion of the Tower Parcel or the Civic Square Parcel and shall be transported to and from the Premises in compliance with all applicable Environmental Laws; iii. any remaining substances shall be completely, properly and lawfully removed from the Premises upon expiration or earlier termination of this Lease or the applicable sublease; and iv. such use shall not constitute a nuisance, danger or health risk to or disrupt the business of any other occupant of the Premises or the Civic Square Parcel. If during the Term of this Lease, Tenant or any Sub-Tenant contemplates utilizing any other Hazardous Materials (or subleasing or assigning this Lease or any portion of the Premises to a Sub- Tenant or assignee who utilizes Hazardous Materials), Tenant shall obtain the prior written consent of Landlord, such consent not to be unreasonably withheld. As a condition of granting such consent, Landlord may require that any such utilization complies with clauses i. through iv. (inclusive) above in this paragraph. If any applicable Environmental Law or other ordinance or substance removal contractor requires that any such substances be disposed of separately from ordinary trash, Tenant shall make arrangements, at Tenant's expense, for such disposal directly with a qualified and licensed disposal company at a lawful disposal site and shall ensure that such disposal occurs frequently enough to prevent unnecessary storage of such substances on the Premises. At such times as Landlord may reasonably request, Tenant shall provide Landlord with a written list identifying any Hazardous Materials then used, stored or maintained upon the Premises, the use and approximate quantity of each such material, a copy of any Material Safety Data Sheet ("MSDS") issued by the manufacturer thereof, written information concerning the removal, transportation, and disposal of the same, and such other information as Landlord may reasonably require or as may be required by Environmental Laws. Landlord, at its option, and at Landlord's expense, may cause an engineer selected by Landlord, to review (1) Sub-Tenants' operations including, without limitation, materials used, generated, stored, disposed, and manufactured in Sub-Tenants' businesses; and (2) Sub-Tenants' compliance with terms of this Section. Tenant and all Sub-Tenants shall provide the engineer with such information reasonably requested by the engineer to complete the review. The first such review may occur prior to or shortly following the commencement of the Term of this Lease. Thereafter, such review shall not occur more frequently than once each year unless cause exists for some other review schedule.

 ARTICLE7

 UTILITIES AND SERVICES

 7.1 Services

 . Tenant (or its Sub-Tenants) shall separately contract and pay for all water, sewer, gas, electricity, telephone, security and trash removal service to the Premises, provided that neither Tenant or any Sub-Tenants shall be obligated to pay for any additional security services that may be separately provided at the Civic Square Parcel by or for Landlord. If Tenant or any Sub-Tenant fails to pay the same when due, Landlord may pay the cost of providing such utilities to the Premises, and Tenant shall reimburse Landlord for such payment on demand with interest accrued at the Interest Rate from the date of payment by Landlord until reimbursed by Tenant.

 7.2 Government Energy or Utility Controls

 7.3 Safety and Security Devices, Services, and Programs

 . The parties acknowledge that safety and security devices, services, and programs provided by Landlord, if any, while intended to deter crime and ensure safety, may not in given instances prevent theft or other criminal acts or ensure safety of persons or property. The risk that any safety or security device, service, or program may not be effective, or may malfunction, or be circumvented by a criminal, is assumed by Tenant with respect to Tenant and Sub- Tenant's property and interests. Tenant agrees to cooperate in any reasonable safety or security program developed by Landlord or required by Law.

 ARTICLE8

 CONDITION OF THE PREMISES

 Except as expressly provided in Exhibit D-1, Tenant acknowledges that Tenant is leasing the Premises on an "as is, where is" basis. Tenant's taking possession of the Premises shall be deemed conclusive evidence that, as of the date of taking possession, the Premises were in good order and satisfactory condition, except for reasonable Punchlist Items delivered in accordance with Exhibit D-1. No promise of Landlord to alter, remodel, repair, or improve the Premises and no representation, express or implied, respecting any matter or thing relating to the Premises or this Lease (including, without limitation, the condition thereof) has been made to Tenant by Landlord or its broker or sales agent, other than as may be expressly contained in this Lease. Promptly following the Possession Date, Tenant shall perform Tenant's Work to the Premises, if any, as described in Exhibit D-1.

 ARTICLE9

Landlord shall keep the sidewalk adjoining the Premises free from rubbish, dirt, ashes, garbage and other refuse.

 . Tenant shall require each of its Sub-Tenants to maintain, repair and replace that portion of the interior of the Premises leased to such Sub-Tenant as needed to keep every part thereof, in good order and repair except portions of Premises to be repaired by Landlord under the express terms of this Lease. Each Sub-Tenant shall agree that it is liable for any damage to the heating, air conditioning, water, sewer, electrical and sprinkler systems (if any) and any damages from the improper use or maintenance thereof. Tenant and/or all Sub-Tenants shall keep the interior of all leased Premises clean and shall not burn any materials or rubbish of any description upon or within the Premises. In the event Tenant or any Sub-Tenant fails to keep the Premises and other portions heretofore described in the proper condition, after written notice and a reasonable opportunity to cure, Landlord may cause the same to be done and Tenant hereby agrees to pay the expense thereof on demand as Rent. Notwithstanding Landlord's general obligation to pay Operating Costs as set forth in Section 9.1 above, Tenant and/or its Sub-Tenants shall pay for (i) all services and utilities serving the Premises as described in Section 7.1; and (ii) all Taxes described in Section 4.2 above.

 9.3 Damage by Tenant

 . Except for ordinary wear and tear and except as provided in Section 16.3 ("Waiver of Subrogation"), Tenant shall promptly reimburse Landlord for any costs that Landlord may incur in making repairs and alterations in and to the Premises, systems or equipment of the Premises where the need for such repairs or alterations is caused by any of the following: i. Tenant's or Sub-Tenants' use or occupancy of the Premises in a fashion that contravenes any provision of this Lease; ii. the installation, removal, use, or operation of Tenant's Property or Sub-Tenant's Property; iii. the moving of Sub- Tenant's Property into or out of the Premises; or iv. any tortious act, omission, misuse, or negligence of any Tenant, any Sub-Tenant or any Tenant Related Parties.

 ARTICLE10

 ALTERATIONS AND ADDITIONS

 10.1 Tenant's Alterations

 . Any additions, alterations, or improvements (collectively, "Alterations") that change the fundamental character of the Premises shall require the prior consent of Landlord, which consent shall be requested by Tenant at least thirty (30) days prior to the commencement of any work. At the time Landlord grants its consent, it may condition same on, among other reasonable requirements, the requirement that such Alterations be removed at the end of the applicable Sublease Term and the subleased Premises restored to their condition as of the commencement date of the applicable Sublease. All Alterations shall be made in a good and workmanlike manner using only good grades of materials; performed by properly qualified and licensed personnel; performed so as not to cause or create any jurisdictional or other labor disputes (provided that nothing herein shall obligate the use of union labor); performed in such manner as not to unreasonably obstruct access to any portion of the Civic Square Parcel; and diligently prosecuted to completion. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Tenant shall have the right during the Term to make or allow Alterations as Tenant may reasonably deem desirable or necessary, following ten (10) days' notice to Landlord, but without Landlord's consent, provided that such work is of a non- structural nature and does not alter the exterior surfaces of the Premises, and does not cost more than $25,000.

 10.2 Payment and Indemnification

 . Except for the Allowance set forth in the Lease Summary, or as provided elsewhere in this Lease, Landlord shall bear no responsibility for the costs of any work done on the Premises by or on behalf of Tenant. Tenant shall keep the Premises and the Civic Square Parcel free and clear of liens of any kind. Tenant shall indemnify, defend against, and keep Landlord free and harmless from all claims, demands, liability, loss, damage, costs, reasonable attorneys' fees, and any other expense incurred on account of claims by any person performing work or furnishing materials or supplies for Tenant or any person claiming under Tenant, including but not limited to resolution of any jurisdictional or other labor disputes.

 10.3 Notices and Liens

 . Tenant agrees not to suffer or permit any lien of any mechanic or materialman to be placed or filed against the Premises or the Civic Square Parcel. In case any such lien shall be filed, Tenant shall satisfy and release such lien of record within twenty (20) days (or such shorter period as may be required by any Mortgagee) after the earlier to occur of receipt of notice thereof from Landlord; or Tenant's actual knowledge or actual notice of such lien filing. If Tenant shall fail to have such lien satisfied and released of record as provided herein, Landlord may, on behalf of Tenant, without being responsible for making any investigation as to the validity of such lien and without limiting or affecting any other remedies Landlord may have, pay the same and Tenant shall reimburse Landlord on demand for such amount together with any other reasonable costs of Landlord, including, without limitation, reasonable attorneys' fees. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Tenant shall have the right to contest any such lien claim diligently and in good faith, and during such contest shall not be obligated to pay such lien claim, provided that Tenant is not in breach of any of its obligations under this Lease, and provided Tenant, at its sole costs and expense, transfers the lien from the Civic Square Parcel to a bond pursuant to RCW 60.04.161, thereby freeing the Civic Square Parcel from any claim of lien. Notwithstanding any such contest or title insurance, Tenant shall pay any such claim in full within five (5) days following the entry of an unstayed judgment or order of sale. All materialmen, contractors, artisans, mechanics, laborers and any other person now or thereafter furnishing any labor, services, materials, supplies or equipment to Tenant with respect to Premises or any portion thereof, are hereby charged with notice that they must look exclusively to Tenant to obtain payment for the same. Notice is hereby given that Landlord shall not be liable for any labor, services, materials, supplies, skill, machinery, fixtures or equipment furnished to or to be furnished to Tenant upon credit and that no mechanic's lien or any other lien for any such labor, services, materials, supplies, machinery, fixtures or equipment shall attach to or effect the state or interest of Landlord in and to the Premises or the Property, or any portion thereof. Before the actual commencement of any work for which a claim or lien may be filed, Tenant shall give Landlord notice of the intended commencement date a sufficient time before that date to enable Landlord to post notices of nonresponsibility or any other notices that Landlord deems necessary for the protection of Landlord's interest in the Premises and Landlord shall have the right to enter the Premises and post such notices at any reasonable time.

 ARTICLE11

 CERTAIN RIGHTS RESERVED BY LANDLORD

 Landlord reserves the following rights, exercisable without liability to Tenant for damage or injury to property, person, or business; causing an actual or constructive eviction from the Premises; or disturbing Tenant's use, possession, or beneficial and quiet enjoyment of the Premises:

 . To change the common name or street address of the Civic Square Parcel.

 11.2 Signage

 . To require that all signage relating to the Premises comply with any signage requirements imposed by this Lease.

 11.3 Keys

 . To have passkeys to the Premises, all doors within the Premises and all doors by which the Premises are accessed.

 11.4 Inspection and Entry

 . Landlord may enter the Premises on reasonable prior notice to Tenant and the appropriate Sub-Tenant (except in the event of an emergency, in which case not notice shall be required), to inspect the Premises; to make repairs to the Premises; and to take all steps as may be reasonably necessary for the safety, protection, maintenance, or preservation of the Premises or Landlord's interest therein, or as may be necessary or desirable for the operation or improvement of the Premises or the Civic Square Parcel or in order to comply with Laws.

 11.5 Renovations

 . To renovate, improve, alter, or modify (collectively, the "Renovations") the Civic Square Parcel and any improvements situated thereon. Renovations may include, without limitation, modifying the Civic Square Parcel to comply with applicable Laws, including, without limitation, regulations relating to the physically disabled, seismic conditions, and building safety and security. In connection with such Renovations, Landlord may, among other things, erect scaffolding or other necessary structures in or around the Premises, limit or eliminate access to portions of the Premises, or perform work in or around the Premises that may create noise, dust or leave debris. Tenant hereby agrees that such Renovations and Landlord's actions in connection therewith shall in no way constitute a constructive eviction of Tenant or any Sub-Tenant nor entitle any person to any abatement of Rent. Landlord shall have no responsibility or for any reason be liable to Tenant for any direct or indirect injury to or interference with the business of Tenant or any Sub-Tenant arising from the Renovations. Upon at least ten (10) days advance written notice to Tenant, Landlord may during the Term perform Renovations to the Premises which are reasonably necessary to accommodate Renovations being performed to the Civic Square Parcel, provided such Renovations to the Premises do not unreasonably interfere with Tenant's or any Sub-Tenant's use of the Premises.

 11.6 Civic Square Common Areas

 . Landlord shall keep and maintain the Civic Square Common Areas (including the Plaza) in good order, condition and repair at all times at its sole cost and in accordance with any REA. Landlord shall have the right to enter into, modify and terminate easements and other agreements pertaining to the use and maintenance of the Civic Square Parcel and to close temporarily any or all portions of the Civic Square Parcel so long as, other than in cases of emergency, such closure does not unreasonably interfere with Tenant's and/or Sub-Tenant's use of the Premises.

 In the exercise of the foregoing rights, Landlord shall (except in an emergency) take reasonable steps to minimize any interference with the business of Tenant and Sub-Tenants.

 During the Term, Tenant and its Sub-Tenants and other licensees, invitees, customers and employees shall have the non- exclusive right to use all Civic Square Common Areas in common with Landlord, other occupants and their respective licensees, invitees, customers and employees. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, Tenant shall have the right to the periodic use of any readerboard, "Jumbotron" sign, or similar signage installed by or for Landlord on or about the Civic Square Parcel. Tenant and its Sub- Tenants shall have the non-exclusive right, with Landlord's reasonable prior approval, and provided such use does not impede the normal circulation of pedestrian and customer traffic, (i) to use reasonable portions of the Plaza immediately adjacent to the Premises for retail kiosks, displays and carts, and restaurant chairs, tables and customer seating, and (ii) to use the remainder of the Plaza for retail kiosks, displays and carts. Landlord shall not use, or permit the use of by anyone other than Tenant, the Plaza area for "retail" purposes, however; Landlord shall retain the exclusive right to schedule, and retain all revenues generated from, "events" in the Plaza or other Civic Square Common Areas. Except with the prior approval of Tenant, which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld, Landlord may not materially increase, decrease, alter, expand, substitute or change the number, locations and dimensions of any Civic Square Common Areas, including street access, sidewalks, and landscaping, where such action would materially interfere with access to or visibility of the Premises, reduce access to nearby parking, or otherwise unreasonably interfere with the business of Tenant or its Sub-Tenants.

 At all times when at least one Sub-Tenant is open for business to the public, Landlord shall cause all elevators and escalators to be operating properly, shall ensure that access to the Civic Square Parcel and the associated parking garage is not closed or interfered with except as otherwise expressly permitted in this Lease, and shall make reasonable efforts to ensure that the water feature in the Plaza is operating (except when shut-off for repairs, maintenance, or weather-related shut-offs).

 ARTICLE12

Landlord shall not be responsible for any violation of the Rules and Regulations by other tenants or occupants of the Premises or the Civic Square Parcel.

Except as otherwise set forth below, Tenant shall have the unrestricted right to enter into subleases and other occupancy agreements ("Subleases") covering space within the Premises to subtenants ("Sub-Tenants"), on terms and in a form as determined by Tenant from time to time in its sole and absolute discretion. Each Sublease shall be in writing and shall expressly state that the Sub-tenant's rights thereunder are subject to the terms and conditions of this Lease. The permitted uses under each such Sublease shall not conflict with the uses permitted under this Lease.

 (b) Subleases Requiring Landlord's Prior Approval. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Landlord's prior reasonable consent shall be required in accordance with the procedures set forth in subparagraph (c) below and the remainder of this Article for any proposed Sublease that: (i) demises more than 3,000 rentable square feet of space; (ii) contains a Sublease term longer than three (3) years (including for purposes of this paragraph any extension or renewal term options contained therein); (iii) contains a Sublease term (including for purposes of this paragraph any extension or renewal term options contained therein) that extends beyond the Expiration Date of this Lease; or (iv) requires as a condition to its effectiveness that Landlord execute a Recognition Agreement as defined below.

 (c) Procedures for Landlord's Consent. As to any proposed Sublease for which Landlord's prior consent is required pursuant to subparagraph (b) above, the following shall apply: Tenant shall notify Landlord of the proposed Transfer by delivering a written notice (a "Transfer Notice") to Landlord setting forth the date of the proposed Transfer which shall be not less than thirty (30) or more than one hundred eighty (180) days after the date of the Transfer Notice. The Transfer Notice shall include: the proposed effective date of the Transfer and the name of the proposed Transferee; a description of the portion of the Premises to be transferred (the "Subject Space"); a copy of the Sublease, which shall include a detailed use clause; any other information reasonably requested by Landlord that will enable Landlord to determine the financial responsibility, character, and reputation of the Transferee and the nature of such Transferee's business.

 (d) Other Transfers. As to any proposed Transfer other than a Sublease or a Permitted Transfer, the following shall apply: Tenant shall deliver a Transfer Notice to Landlord at least thirty (30) days but not more than one hundred eighty (180) days prior to the proposed effective date of the Transfer. The Transfer Notice shall contain: all of the terms of the proposed Transfer and the consideration therefor, the name and address of the Transferee; current financial statements of the Transferee certified by an officer, partner or owner thereof; and any other information reasonably requested by Landlord that will enable Landlord to determine the financial responsibility, character, and reputation of the Transferee and the nature of such Transferee's business. Landlord shall respond under Section 13.3 to any properly delivered Transfer notice within fifteen (15) days of receiving the same.

 (e) Recognition Agreement. Upon the request of Tenant or any Leasehold Mortgagee (described below), Landlord shall within a reasonable time (not exceeding twenty (20) days after Tenant's written request) execute, acknowledge and deliver a recognition agreement with such Leasehold Mortgagee and with any Sub- Tenant in commercially reasonable form (a "Recognition Agreement"), confirming that, in the event of termination of this Lease for any reason (including without limitation by expiration of the Term), such Sub-Tenant shall be entitled to continued occupancy of its space in accordance with its Sublease as long as: (a) such Sublease is not terminated in accordance with its terms and (b) the Sub-Tenant agrees to attorn to Landlord under the applicable Sublease (including the

 payment of all rental and other charges without offset for prepayments previously made other than rental and other charges paid not more than one month in advance) and agrees not to effect the termination of the same due to any termination of this Lease. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Landlord will not be obligated to provide a Recognition Agreement in connection with Subleases for building management purposes or to Subleases to Affiliates of Tenant at rates and terms other than those then prevailing in the market, and upon the termination or expiration of this Lease, such building management leases and leases to Affiliates of Tenant shall also terminate. In addition, no Recognition Agreement shall obligate Landlord to undertake or complete any construction obligations or provide any allowances to be provided by Tenant under any Sublease.

 (f) Leasehold Mortgages. Tenant shall be entitled to grant mortgages, deeds of trust or other liens on its leasehold interests under this Lease, provided Tenant first provides Landlord with written notice of such mortgage, deed of trust or lien and the beneficiary or mortgagee thereof (each, a "Leasehold Mortgagee").

 (g) Reimbursement of Certain Costs. Upon the expiration or earlier termination of this Lease for any reason other than a Default by Tenant, Landlord shall pay Tenant the unamortized portion of the following costs, to the extent the same have been actually paid by Tenant under a Sublease to which Landlord has granted its consent: (i) tenant improvement and construction allowances paid by Tenant for Alterations to any portion of the Premises subleased to Subtenants, and (ii) all brokers' fees and commissions paid by Tenant in connection with such Subleases. For purposes of this paragraph, the costs described herein shall be amortized on a straight-line basis over the term(s) of the applicable Sublease(s) and the unamortized portion of such costs shall be that portion attributable to the then remaining term of the applicable Subleases(s),

 13.2 Fees

 . Except as to any Transfer by Sublease or any Permitted Transfer, Tenant shall pay Landlord's reasonable review and processing fees incurred in connection with any proposed Transfer, as well as any reasonable legal fees incurred by Landlord, within thirty (30) days after written request by Landlord. The total of such fees shall not exceed $1,500 per request.

 13.3 Consent

 . Landlord shall respond to any Transfer Notice by either granting its consent to the proposed Transfer or setting forth the basis for Landlord's decision to withhold such consent; provided Landlord shall not withhold its consent to any Permitted Transfer and Landlord shall not unreasonably withhold or delay its consent to any proposed Transfer. It shall be reasonable under this Lease and under any applicable Law for Landlord to withhold consent to any proposed Transfer where one or more of the following apply, without limitation as to other reasonable grounds for withholding consent:

 13.3.1 Neither the Transferee nor any of its principal investors or proposed asset or property manager has at least three (3) years of experience of operating the same or a similar business as described in the applicable Transfer Notice.

 13.3.2 The Transferee is not a party of reasonable financial worth or financial stability in light of the responsibilities involved under the applicable Sublease on the date consent is requested, as reasonably determined by Landlord.

 13.3.3 The Transfer would cause a violation of another lease of the Premises or any agreement to which Landlord is a party, or would give an occupant of the Premises a right to cancel its lease.

 13.3.4 The Transfer would cause a violation of any provision under this Lease.

 13.4 Completion of Transfer

 . If Landlord consents to any proposed Transfer (or if the Transfer is a Permitted Transfer or is a Sublease to which Landlord's consent is not required pursuant to this Lease), Tenant may within six (6) months after Landlord's consent, enter into the approved Transfer, upon substantially the same terms and conditions as set forth in the Transfer Notice. If there are any material changes in the terms and conditions from those specified in the Transfer Notice i. such that Landlord would initially have been entitled to refuse its consent to such Transfer; or ii. that would cause the proposed Transfer to be more favorable to the Transferee than the terms set forth in the Transfer Notice, Tenant shall again submit the Transfer to Landlord for its approval.

 13.5 Effect of Transfer

 . If Landlord consents to a Transfer, i. no terms or conditions of this Lease shall be deemed to have been waived or modified; ii. such consent shall not be deemed consent to any further Transfer; iii. no Transfer shall be valid, and no Transferee shall take possession of the Premises, until an executed counterpart of all documentation pertaining to the Transfer has been delivered to Landlord; and iv. no Transfer shall relieve Tenant from primary liability under this Lease. The acceptance of Rent by Landlord from any party shall not be deemed to be a waiver by Landlord of any provision hereof. In the event of Default by a Transferee in the performance of any of the terms hereof, Landlord may proceed directly against Tenant without the necessity of exhausting remedies against such Transferee.

 13.6 Tenant Remedy for Landlord Refusal to Consent

 .

 (a) Complete Transfer. Notwithstanding any provision of this Lease or any applicable Laws to the contrary, Landlord and Tenant hereby expressly agree that if a court of competent jurisdiction determines that Landlord unreasonably withheld consent to a proposed Transfer of all of Tenant's interest hereunder, then Tenant's sole and exclusive remedy for such breach by Landlord shall be termination of this Lease as of the date of such court determination.

 (b) Other Transfers. If a court of competent jurisdiction determines that Landlord unreasonably withheld consent to a proposed Sublease or other Transfer of less than all of Tenant's interest hereunder, then Tenant shall not be entitled to terminate this Lease but shall instead be entitled to recover monetary damages suffered by Tenant as a result of Landlord withholding consent.

 ARTICLE14

 DESTRUCTION OR DAMAGE

 14.1 Landlord Termination Rights

 . If any portion of the Premises or any portion of the Civic Square Parcel necessary for occupancy of the Premises is damaged by fire, earthquake, terrorism, act of war, act of God, the elements or other casualty, and the insurance proceeds available to Landlord are not sufficient to completely restore or repair such damage, Landlord may terminate this Lease as to such damaged portion of the Premises upon notice given to Tenant within sixty (60) days after the date of such casualty, effective as of the date of the casualty. For purposes of this paragraph, Landlord shall be deemed to have obtained property insurance on all improvements and Alterations situated on the Premises and the Civic Square Parcel satisfying the requirements of Section 17.1.2 below, whether or not it actually carries any such policy. Within 30 days after any election by Landlord to terminate this Lease pursuant to this Section, Tenant may nullify such election by agreeing to pay to Landlord the amount by which Landlord's insurance proceeds are insufficient to restore the damaged portion of the Premises.

 14.2 Repairs

 . If this Lease is not terminated as provided above, it shall continue in full force and effect, and Landlord shall promptly and diligently, subject to reasonable delays for insurance adjustment, and subject to all other terms of this Article, restore all damage (except for the furniture, fixtures, equipment, and other personal property required to be insured by Tenant and/or its Sub-Tenants). Such restoration shall be to substantially the same condition of such items as prior to the casualty, except for modifications (i) required by Law or (ii) to the Civic Square Parcel mutually approved by the parties. No such modifications shall materially impair access to or the visibility of the Premises and its signage. Tenant shall be responsible, at its sole cost and expense, for the repair, restoration, and replacement of Tenant's Property and Sub-Tenant's Property. Landlord shall not be liable for any loss of business, inconvenience, or annoyance arising from any repair or restoration of any portion of the Premises as a result of any damage from any casualty.

 14.3 Tenant's Termination Rights

 . If Landlord does not elect to terminate this Lease pursuant to Landlord's termination right as provided above, and the repairs cannot be completed within three hundred sixty five (365) days after the date of the casualty (the "Repair Period"), Tenant may elect, by the date that is the later to occur of (i) the date that is sixty (60) days after the date of the casualty, and (ii) the date that is thirty (30) days after receipt of Landlord's written election not to terminate, to terminate this Lease by notice to Landlord, effective as of the date specified in the notice, which date shall not be less than thirty (30) days nor more than sixty (60) days after such notice. Tenant shall also have the right to terminate this Lease as to the damaged Premises if Landlord does not complete repairs within the Repair Period by thirty (30) days' notice to Landlord after the expiration of the Repair Period; provided however, if Landlord completes repair within such thirty (30) day period, such termination shall be nullified and this Lease shall continue in full force and effect. In addition, in the event that any portion of the Premises is destroyed or damaged to any substantial extent during the last twelve (12) months of the Term, then Tenant shall have the option to terminate this Lease in its entirety by giving notice to Landlord within thirty (30) days after such casualty, in which event this Lease shall cease and terminate as of the date of such notice.

 14.4 Apportionment of Rent

 . Upon any termination of this Lease pursuant to this Article, Tenant shall pay the Rent, properly apportioned up to such date of termination, and both parties hereto shall thereafter be freed and discharged of all further obligations hereunder, except as provided for in provisions of this Lease that by their terms survive the expiration or earlier termination of this Lease.

 14.5 Abatement

 . The Rent shall abate on an equitable basis to the extent Tenant's use of the Premises is impaired, commencing with the date of the casualty and continuing until completion of the repairs required of Landlord.

 14.6 Express Agreement

 . This Lease shall be considered an express agreement governing any case of damage to or destruction of the Premises by fire or other casualty; and any present or future Law that purports to govern the rights of Landlord and Tenant in such circumstances in the absence of express agreement shall have no application.

 ARTICLE15

 EMINENT DOMAIN

 15.1 Entire Premises

 . If the whole of either the Civic Square Parcel or the Tower Parcel is lawfully taken by condemnation or in any other manner for any public or quasi-public purpose, this Lease shall terminate as of the earlier of the date of the date title vests or the date possession is given, and Rent shall be prorated to such date.

 15.2 Partial Condemnation

 . If less than the whole of the Civic Square Parcel or the Tower Parcel is so taken, this Lease shall be unaffected by such taking, except that (i) Tenant shall have the right to terminate this Lease by notice to Landlord given within ninety (90) days after the date of such taking if twenty-five percent (25%) or more of the Tower Parcel or the Civic Square Parcel is taken; and (ii) Landlord shall have the right to terminate this Lease by notice to Tenant given within ninety (90) days after the date of such taking. If either Landlord or Tenant so elects to terminate this Lease, this Lease shall terminate on the thirtieth (30th) day after either such notice. The Rent shall be prorated to the date of termination.

 15.3 Proceeds of Award

 .

 (a) Taking of Civic Square Parcel. In the event of any taking of the Civic Square Parcel, partial or whole, all of the proceeds of any award, judgment, or settlement payable by the condemning authority shall be the exclusive property of Landlord, and Tenant hereby assigns to Landlord all of its right, title, and interest in any award, judgment, or settlement from the condemning authority. Tenant, however, shall have the right, to the extent that Landlord's award is not reduced or prejudiced, to claim from the condemning authority (but not from Landlord) such compensation as may be recoverable by Tenant in its own right.

 15.4 Repairs

 . In the event of a partial taking of the Premises that does not result in a termination of this Lease, Landlord shall restore the remaining portion of the Premises as nearly as practicable to its condition prior to the condemnation or taking. Tenant shall be responsible at its sole cost and expense for the repair, restoration, and replacement of Sub-Tenant's Property.

 15.5 Takings by City of Seattle

 . Notwithstanding anything to the contrary elsewhere herein, in the event of any taking of any portion or interest in the Tower Parcel or the Civic Square Parcel by condemnation or in any other manner for any public or quasi-public purpose or deed in lieu thereof involving the City of Seattle in its governmental capacity, then Tenant shall be entitled to a share of any just compensation that may be awarded in connection therewith as its interest may appear.

 16.2 Assumption of Risk

 . Tenant agrees that no Landlord Related Parties will be liable for any loss, injury, death, or damage to persons, property, or Tenant's business resulting from i. theft; ii. act of God, public enemy, injunction, riot, strike, insurrection, war, terrorism, court order, requisition, order of governmental body or authority (other than Landlord acting in its governmental capacity), fire, explosion or falling objects; iii. business interruption or loss of use of the Premises other than that which arises from Landlord's gross negligence or intentional misconduct; iv. any diminution or shutting off of light, air or view by any structure erected on the Civic Square Parcel or any land adjacent to the Civic Square Parcel; v. mold or indoor air quality, except due to Landlord's breach of its repair and maintenance obligations under this Lease; vi. any acts or omissions of any other tenant, occupant or visitor of the Civic Square Parcel or the Tower Parcel; or vii. any cause beyond Landlord's control. In no event shall Landlord be liable for indirect, consequential, or punitive damages or for damages based on lost profits. None of the foregoing shall be considered a constructive eviction of Tenant, nor shall the same entitle Tenant to an abatement of Rent.

 16.3 Waiver of Subrogation

 . Anything in this Lease to the contrary notwithstanding, Landlord and Tenant each hereby waives any and all rights of recovery, claim, action or cause of action against the other for any loss or damage to any property of Landlord or Tenant, arising from any cause that would be insured against under the terms of any property insurance required to be carried hereunder; or is insured against under the terms of any property insurance actually carried, regardless of whether the same is required hereunder. For purposes of this paragraph, Landlord shall be deemed to have obtained property insurance satisfying the requirements of Section 17.1.2 below, whether or not it actually carries any such policy. The foregoing waiver shall apply regardless of the cause or origin of such claim, including but not limited to the negligence of a party, or such party's agents, officers, employees or contractors. The foregoing waiver shall not apply if it would have the effect, but only to the extent of such effect, of invalidating any insurance coverage of Landlord or Tenant. The foregoing waiver shall also apply to any deductible, as if the same were a part of the insurance recovery. The foregoing waiver shall not apply in any case where its application would void or diminish coverage under such policies of insurance. Each party shall obtain from its insurer(s) under each insurance policy it maintains a waiver of all rights of subrogation that the insurer may have against the other party and Landlord and Tenant shall each indemnify the other against any loss or expense, including reasonable attorneys' fees, resulting from the failure to obtain such waiver.

 ARTICLE19

 LANDLORD REMEDIES AND DAMAGES

 19.1 Remedies

 . In the event of a Default, then in addition to any other rights or remedies Landlord may have at law or in equity, Landlord shall have the right, at Landlord's option, without further notice or demand of any kind, to do any or all of the following without prejudice to any other remedy that Landlord may have:

 19.1.1 Terminate this Lease and Tenant's right to possession of the Premises by giving notice to Tenant. Tenant shall immediately surrender the Premises to Landlord whereupon Tenant shall have no further claim to the Premises or under this Lease.

 19.1.2 Continue this Lease in effect, but terminate Tenant's right to possession of the Premises and whereupon Tenant shall have no further claim to the Premises and Landlord shall have the right to collect all rent and other charges which are due or become due from Sub-Tenants.

 19.1.3 Landlord may relet the Premises without thereby terminating this Lease (if the same has not been previously terminated), and Tenant shall remain liable for any and all Rent and other charges and expenses hereunder. For the purpose of reletting, Landlord is authorized to make such repairs or alterations to the Premises as may be necessary in the sole discretion of Landlord for the purpose of such reletting, and if a sufficient sum is not realized from such reletting (after payment of all costs and expenses of such repairs, alterations and the expense of such reletting (including, without limitation, reasonable attorney and brokerage fees) and the collection of rent accruing therefrom) each month to equal the Rent, then Tenant shall pay such deficiency each month upon demand therefor. Actions to collect such amounts may be brought from time to time, on one or more occasions, without the necessity of Landlord's waiting until the expiration of the Term.

 19.1.4 Without any further notice or demand, Landlord may

 enter upon the Premises, if necessary, without being liable for prosecution or claim for damages therefor, and do whatever Tenant is obligated to do under the terms of the Lease. Tenant agrees to reimburse Landlord on demand for any reasonable expenses which Landlord may incur in effecting compliance with Tenant's obligations under the Lease. Tenant further agrees that Landlord shall not be liable for any damages resulting to Tenant from such action, unless caused by the gross negligence or willful misconduct of Landlord, but subject to the other limitations on Landlord's liability set forth on this Lease. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, Landlord will have no obligation to cure any Default of Tenant.

 19.1.5 Landlord shall at all times have the right, without prior demand or notice except as required by Law, to seek any declaratory, injunctive or other equitable relief, and specifically enforce this Lease, or restrain or enjoin a violation or breach of any provision hereof, without the necessity of proving the inadequacy of any legal remedy or irreparable harm.

 19.1.6 To the extent permitted by applicable Law, Landlord shall have the right, without notice to Tenant, to change or re-key all locks to entrances to the Premises, and Landlord shall have no obligation to give Tenant notice thereof or to provide Tenant with a key to the Premises.

 19.1.7 The rights given to Landlord in this Article are cumulative and shall be in addition and supplemental to all other rights or remedies that Landlord may have under this Lease and under applicable Laws or in equity.

 19.2 Damages

 . Should Landlord elect to terminate this Lease or Tenant's right to possession under the provisions above, Landlord may recover the following damages from Tenant:

 19.2.1 Past Rent. The worth at the time of the award of any unpaid Rent that had been earned at the time of termination; plus

 19.2.2 Rent Prior to Award. The worth at the time of the award of the unpaid Rent that would have been earned after termination, until the time of award; plus

 19.2.3 Rent After Award. The worth at the time of the award of the amount by which the unpaid Rent for the balance of the term after the time of award exceeds the amount of the rental loss that Tenant proves could have been reasonably avoided, if any; plus

 19.2.4 Proximately Caused Damages. Any other amount necessary to compensate Landlord for all detriment proximately caused by Tenant's failure to perform its obligations under this Lease or that in the ordinary course of things would be likely to result therefrom, including, but not limited to, any costs or expenses (including, without limitation, reasonable attorneys' fees), incurred by Landlord in retaking possession of the Premises; maintaining the Premises after Default; preparing the Premises or any portion thereof for reletting to a new tenant, including, without limitation, any repairs or alterations, whether for the same or a different use; reletting the Premises, including but not limited to, advertising expenses, brokers' commissions and fees; and and any special concessions made to obtain a new tenant.

 19.2.5 Other Damages. At Landlord's election, such other amounts in addition to or in lieu of the foregoing as may be permitted from time to time by Law.

 As used in subsections 19.2.1 and 19.2.2, the phrase "worth at the time of the award" shall be computed by adding interest on all such sums from the date when originally due at the Interest Rate. As used in subsection 19.2.3, the phrase "worth at the time of the award" shall be computed by discounting the sum in question at the Federal Reserve rate promulgated by the Federal Reserve office for the district in which the Premises are located, plus one percent (1%). For the purposes of this Section, "Rent" for each year of the unexpired Term shall be the Minimum Rent, Percentage Rent and Additional Rent payable during the preceding year, together with any other continuously accruing expenses payable during the preceding year.

 19.3 Rent after Termination

 . Tenant specifically acknowledges and agrees that Landlord shall have the right to continue to collect Rent after any termination (whether said termination occurs through eviction proceedings or as a result of some other early termination pursuant to this Lease) for the remainder of the Term, less any amounts collected by Landlord from the reletting of the Premises, but in no event shall Tenant be entitled to receive any excess of any such rents collected over the Rent.

 19.4 No Termination

 . A termination of this Lease by Landlord or the recovery of possession of the Premises by Landlord or any voluntary or other surrender of this Lease by Tenant or a mutual cancellation thereof, shall not work a merger and shall at the option of Landlord, terminate all or any existing franchises or concessions, licenses, permits, subleases, subtenancies or the like between Tenant and any third party with respect to the Premises, or may, at the option of Landlord, operate as an assignment to Landlord of Tenant's interest in same. Following a Default, Landlord shall have the right to require any Sub-Tenants to pay all sums due under their subleases directly to Landlord.

 19.5 Waiver of Demand

 . All demands for Rent that are not expressly required by the terms hereof, are hereby waived by Tenant.

 19.6 Deficiency

 . If it is necessary for Landlord to bring suit in order to collect any deficiency, Landlord shall have the right to allow such deficiencies to accumulate and to bring an action on several or all of the accrued deficiencies at one time. Any such suit shall not prejudice in any way the right of Landlord to bring a similar action for any subsequent deficiency or deficiencies.

 19.7 Counterclaim

 . In the event Tenant must, because of applicable court rules or statutes, interpose any counterclaim or other claim against Landlord in such proceedings, Landlord and Tenant agree that, in addition to any other lawful remedy of Landlord, upon motion of Landlord, such counterclaim or other claim asserted by Tenant shall be severed from the proceedings instituted by Landlord (and, if necessary, transferred to a court of different jurisdiction), and the proceedings instituted by Landlord may proceed to final judgment separately and apart from and without consolidation with or reference to the status of any such counterclaim or any other claim asserted by Tenant.

 19.8 Mitigation of Damages

 .

 19.8.1 Landlord shall not be obligated to lease the Premises to a substitute tenant for a rental amount less than the greater of (a) the current fair market rental then prevailing for similar retail uses in comparable buildings in the same market area as the Premises, or (b) the rental rate payable under this Lease; nor shall Landlord be obligated to enter into a new lease under other terms and conditions that are unacceptable to Landlord.

 19.8.2 Landlord shall not be obligated to enter into a lease with any substitute tenant whose use would:

 (a) Disrupt the tenant mix of or place excessive parking burdens upon the Civic Square Parcel;

 (b) Violate any restriction, covenant, or requirement contained in the lease of any Sub-Tenant or any other agreement to which Landlord is a party;

 (c) Be incompatible with the operation of the Civic Square Parcel in the Landlord's reasonable discretion.

 19.8.3 Landlord shall not be obligated to enter into a lease with any substitute tenant that does not have, in Landlord's reasonable opinion, sufficient financial resources or operating experience to operate the Premises in a first-class manner.

 19.8.4 Landlord shall not be required to expend any amount of money to alter, remodel, or otherwise make the Premises suitable for use by a substitute tenant unless

 (a) Tenant pays any such sum to Landlord in advance of Landlord's execution of a lease with such substitute tenant (which payment shall not be in lieu of any damages or other sums to which Landlord may be entitled as a result of Tenant's Default); or

 (b) Landlord determines that any such expenditure is financially justified in connection with entering into any such lease.

 19.8.5 Upon compliance with the above criteria regarding the re-letting of the Premises after a Default, Landlord shall be deemed to have fully satisfied Landlord's obligation to mitigate damages under this Lease and under any Law. Until Landlord is able to relet the Premises, Tenant must pay to Landlord, on or before the first day of each calendar month, the monthly Rent and any other charges provided in this Lease. No such reletting shall be construed as an election on the part of Landlord to terminate this Lease unless Landlord gives Tenant a notice of such intention. Notwithstanding any such reletting without termination, Landlord may at any time thereafter elect to terminate this Lease for such previous breach.

 ARTICLE20

 BANKRUPTCY

 In the event a petition is filed by or against Tenant under the Bankruptcy Code, Tenant, as debtor and debtor in possession, and any trustee who may be appointed agree to adequately protect Landlord as follows:

 20.1.1 to pay monthly in advance on the first day of each month as reasonable compensation for use and occupancy of the Premises an amount equal to all Rent due pursuant to this Lease;

 20.1.2 to perform each and every obligation of Tenant under this Lease until such time as this Lease is either rejected or assumed by order of a court of competent jurisdiction;

 20.1.3 to determine within one hundred twenty (120) days after the filing of such petition whether to assume or reject this Lease;

 20.1.4 to give Landlord at least thirty (30) days' prior notice, unless a shorter period is agreed to in writing by the parties, of any proceeding relating to any assumption of this Lease;

 20.1.5 to give at least thirty (30) days' prior notice of any vacation or abandonment of the Premises, any such vacation or abandonment to be deemed a rejection of this Lease; and

 20.1.6 to do all other things to benefit to Landlord otherwise required under the Bankruptcy Code.

 This Lease shall be deemed rejected in the event of the failure to comply with any of the above.

 In order to provide Landlord with the assurance contemplated by the Bankruptcy Code, the following obligations must be fulfilled, in addition to any other reasonable obligations that Landlord may require, before any assumption of this Lease is effective: (i) all monetary Defaults under this Lease must be cured; (ii) all other Defaults (other than those arising solely on account of the bankruptcy filing) must be cured within fifteen (15) days after the date of assumption; (iii) all actual monetary losses incurred by Landlord (including, but not limited to, reasonable attorneys' fees) must be paid to Landlord within ten (10) days after the date of assumption; and (iv) Landlord must receive within ten (10) days after the date of assumption a security deposit in the amount of six (6) months' Minimum Rent and an advance prepayment of three (3) months' Minimum Rent.

 In the event this Lease is assumed in accordance with the requirements of the Bankruptcy Code and this Lease, and is subsequently assigned, then, in addition to any other reasonable obligations that Landlord may require and in order to provide Landlord with the assurances contemplated by the Bankruptcy Code, Landlord must be provided with (a) a financial statement of the proposed assignee prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles consistently applied, though on a cash basis, which reveals a net worth in an amount sufficient, in Landlord's reasonable judgment, to assure the future performance by the proposed assignee of Tenant's obligations under this Lease; or (b) a written guaranty by one or more guarantors with financial ability sufficient to assure the future performance of Tenant's obligations under this Lease, such guaranty to be in form and content satisfactory to Landlord and to cover the performance of all of Tenant's obligations under the Lease.

 Neither Tenant nor any trustee who may be appointed in the event of the filing of a petition under the Bankruptcy Code shall conduct or permit the conduct of any "fire," "bankruptcy," "going out of business" or auction sale in or from the Premises.

In such event, the monthly installments of Minimum Rent shall be increased to one hundred twenty-five percent (125%) of the monthly installments of Minimum Rent in effect at the expiration of the Term. If a month-to-month tenancy is created, either party may terminate such tenancy by giving the other party at least thirty (30) days advance notice of the date of termination. The provisions of this Article shall not constitute a waiver by Landlord of any right of re-entry as otherwise available to Landlord, nor shall receipt of any Rent or any other act appearing to affirm the tenancy operate as a waiver of the right to terminate this Lease for a Default by Tenant hereof.

 ARTICLE23

 SURRENDER OF PREMISES

 Upon the expiration or earlier termination of this Lease, Tenant shall peaceably surrender the Premises to Landlord subject to the interest of valid Transferees. All fixtures, equipment, improvements, and appurtenances attached to or built into the Premises at the commencement of or during the Term, whether or not by or at the expense of Tenant, other than Sub-Tenant's Property, shall be and remain a part of the Premises, shall be the property of Landlord, and shall not be removed by Tenant, except as otherwise required elsewhere in this Lease. Tenant shall promptly repair any damage to the Premises resulting from such removal. Sub-Tenant's Property shall be and shall remain the property of such Sub-Tenants.

 ARTICLE27

 LENDER PROVISIONS

 27.1 Subordination

 . This Lease is subject and subordinate to the lien of any mortgages, deeds to secure debt or trust deeds, now or hereafter in force against the Civic Square Parcel, if any, and to all renewals, extensions, modifications, consolidations and replacements thereof (collectively, "Mortgages"), and to all advances made or hereafter to be made upon the security of such Mortgages. Tenant covenants and agrees in the event any proceedings are brought for the foreclosure of any mortgage, deed to secure debt or trust deed to attorn, without any deductions or set-offs whatsoever, to the purchaser upon any such foreclosure sale (the "Purchaser") if so requested to do so by the Purchaser, and to recognize the Purchaser as the lessor under this Lease. Tenant shall, within twenty (20) days of a request by Landlord, execute such further instruments or assurances as Landlord may reasonably deem necessary to evidence or confirm the subordination or superiority of this Lease to any Mortgages. Notwithstanding the provisions hereof, should any Mortgagee require that this Lease be prior rather than subordinate to its Mortgage, or require that Tenant attorn to any Purchaser, then in such event, this Lease shall become prior and superior to such Mortgage, or Tenant shall so attorn, upon notice to that effect to Tenant from such Mortgagee. The aforesaid superiority of this Lease to any Mortgage shall be self-operative upon the giving of such notice and no further documentation other than such notice shall be required to effectuate such superiority or attornment. In the event Landlord or such Mortgagee desires confirmation of such superiority or attornment, Tenant shall, promptly upon request therefor by Landlord or such Mortgagee, and without charge therefor, execute a document acknowledging such priority or attornment obligation to the Mortgagee as Landlord in the event of foreclosure or deed in lieu thereof or termination of a ground lease. Tenant's subordination of its interest in this Lease and agreement to attorn to the Purchaser is conditioned on its receipt of an executed non-disturbance agreement in form reasonably acceptable to Tenant as may be requested periodically by Tenant.

 27.2 Estoppel Certificates

 . Within thirty (30) days after written request from either party, either party shall execute and deliver to the requesting party a written statement certifying that this Lease is unmodified and in full force and effect or is in full force and effect as modified and stating the modifications; the amount of Minimum Rent and the date to which Minimum Rent and Additional Rent have been paid in advance; the amount of any security deposit, if any; that the requesting is not in default hereunder or, if the requesting party is claimed to be in default, stating the nature of any claimed default; and such other factual matters concerning the Lease or the Premises as may be reasonably requested. Any such statement may be relied upon by a purchaser, assignee, or Mortgagee.

 27.3 Notice and Cure Rights

 . Tenant agrees to copy any Mortgagee whose address has been furnished to Tenant on any notice of default served by Tenant on Landlord. If Landlord fails to cure such default within the time provided for in this Lease, such Mortgagee shall have an additional thirty (30) days to cure such default; provided that, if such default cannot reasonably be cured within that thirty (30) day period, then such Mortgagee shall have such additional time to cure the default as is reasonably necessary under the circumstances.

 ARTICLE28

 . No payment by Tenant or receipt by Landlord of a lesser amount than the Rent provided for in this Lease shall be deemed to be other than on account of the earliest due Rent; nor shall any endorsement or statement on any check or letter accompanying any check or payment as Rent be deemed an accord and satisfaction. Landlord may accept such check or payment without prejudice to Landlord's right to recover the balance of the Rent or pursue any other remedy provided for in this Lease. In connection with the foregoing, Landlord shall have the absolute right in its sole discretion to apply any payment received from Tenant to any account or other payment of Tenant then not current and due or delinquent.

 EXHIBIT D-1 - TENANT IMPROVEMENT WORK

 1. Preparation of Working Drawings.

 (a) Landlord and Tenant have established specifications to be used in the construction of the Tenant Improvements (the "Specifications"). The quality of Tenant Improvements shall be equal to or of greater quality than the quality of the Specifications.

 (b) Tenant shall retain an architect/space planner reasonably approved by Landlord ("Architect") to prepare the construction drawings for the Tenant Improvements. The plans and drawings to be prepared by Architect and the Engineer hereunder shall be known collectively as the "Working Drawings." All Working Drawings shall comply with the drawing format and specifications as reasonably determined by Landlord. It shall be the responsibility of Tenant and Architect to verify, in the field, the dimensions and conditions as shown on the relevant portions of the base Premises plans.

 (c) On or before the date set forth in Schedule 1 attached hereto, Tenant and Architect shall prepare the final space plan for Tenant Improvements in the Premises (collectively, "Final Space Plans"), which Final Space Plans shall include a layout and designation of all offices, rooms and other partitioning, their intended use, and equipment to be contained therein, and shall deliver the Final Space Plans to Landlord for Landlord's reasonable approval, which shall be given (or denied, with an explanation of the basis therefor) within twenty (20) days after submittal.

 (d) On or before the date set forth in Schedule 1, Tenant and Architect shall complete the architectural and engineering drawings for the Premises, and the final architectural working drawings in a form that is sufficient to allow subcontractors to bid on the work and to obtain all applicable permits (collectively, "Final Working Drawings") and shall submit the same to Landlord for Landlord's reasonable approval, which shall be given (or denied, with an explanation of the basis therefor) within twenty (20) days after submittal.

 (e) The Landlord must approve the Final Working Drawings ("Approved Working Drawings") prior to the commencement of the construction of the Tenant Improvements. Landlord shall not unreasonably withhold its approval of the Final Working Drawings, but may withhold such approval in the event that the proposed Final Drawings are not consistent with the architecture and aesthetics other Tenant Improvements constructed upon the Civic Square Parcel.

 2. Permits.

 (a) Upon receipt of Landlord's approval, Tenant shall promptly submit the Approved Working Drawings to the appropriate municipal authorities for all applicable building permits necessary for the Tenant Improvements ("Permits"), and, in connection therewith, Tenant shall coordinate with Landlord in order to allow Landlord, at its option, to take part in all phases of the permitting process. Tenant shall supply Landlord, as soon as possible, with all plan check numbers and dates of submittal. Tenant shall use commercially reasonable efforts to obtain the Permits on or before the date set forth in Schedule 1. Neither Landlord nor Landlord's consultants shall be responsible for obtaining any building permit or certificate of occupancy for the Premises and that the obtaining of the same shall be Tenant's responsibility; provided however that Landlord shall, in any event, cooperate with Tenant in executing permit applications and performing other ministerial acts reasonably necessary to enable Tenant to obtain any Permits.

 3. Time Deadlines.

 The parties cooperate and use good faith, efforts and all due diligence to cooperate with each other and the Architect, and the Engineers to complete all phases of the working drawings and the permitting process so that Tenant may receive the Permits as soon as possible after the execution of the Lease, and, in that regard, shall meet together on a scheduled basis to discuss Tenant's progress in connection with the same. The applicable dates for approval of items, plans and drawings in this Tenant Work Letter are set forth and further elaborated upon in Schedule 1 ("Time Deadlines"), attached hereto. The parties agree to use reasonable efforts to comply with the Time Deadlines.

 4. Allowance.

 Provided no uncured Default then exists, Landlord shall provide an amount equal to the Allowance to be applied toward the "Total Construction Costs" for the Tenant Improvements, which as used herein shall mean the entire costs incurred by Tenant for: constructing the Tenant Improvements, including space planning and preparation of the Approved Working Drawings, labor and materials, electrical and other utility usage during construction, permit fees, inspection fees, additional janitorial services, trash removal, general tenant signage, related taxes, bonding and insurance costs, if any, the general contractor's general conditions, fees of Tenant's construction managers, WSST, and the initial costs to acquire and install kiosks, carts, and displays. All Tenant Improvements for which the Allowance has been made available shall be deemed Landlord's property to the extent they are constructed upon (or, in the cast of any kiosks, carts or displays funded with the Allowance, used on) the Civic Square Parcel. Tenant shall not be entitled to use any portion of the Allowance for anything other than the foregoing. In no event shall Landlord be obligated to make disbursements with respect to the Tenant Improvements in an amount that exceeds the Allowance. The Allowance shall be disbursed to Tenant within twenty (20) days after receipt of Tenant's written request therefor, accompanied by a statement of values of work performed covered by the request signed by Tenant's general contractor or architect and lien waivers from Tenant's general contractor and all subcontractors and material suppliers providing more than $10,000 of labor or materials during the period covered by the reimbursement request.

 Landlord shall not be required to initially disburse more than $40.00 per rentable square foot of those portions of the Premises that have been or are then being improved by Tenant. For example, if Tenant expends $80.00 per rentable square foot of Total Construction Costs on the first 7,000 rentable square feet being improved as part of the Tenant Improvements (i.e, Total Construction Costs as to such portion equal to $560,000.00), Landlord shall nevertheless be required to disburse only up to $280,000.00 toward such costs (i.e., $40.00 x 7,000 rentable square feet then being improved). If Tenant expends less than $40.00 per rentable square foot of Total Construction Costs on any particular Tenant Improvement project, Tenant shall still be entitled to apply the remainder toward future Tenant Improvement Work, so long as at no time shall Landlord be required to disburse more than $40.00 per rentable square foot of those portions of the Premises that have been or are then being improved by Tenant.
