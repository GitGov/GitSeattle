 111.4 Authority to disconnect utilities in emergencies. The code official has the authority to disconnect fuel-gas utility service or energy supplies to a building, structure, premises or equipment regulated by this code in case of emergency where necessary to eliminate an immediate hazard to life or property. The code official may enter any building or premises to disconnect utility service. The code official shall, whenever possible, notify the serving utility, the owner and the occupant of the building, structure or premises of the decision to disconnect prior to taking such action, and shall notify the serving utility, owner and occupant of the building, structure or premises in writing of such disconnection immediately thereafter.

 111.5 Authority to condemn equipment. Whenever the code official determines that any equipment or portion thereof regulated by this code is hazardous to life, health or property, the code official shall order in writing that such equipment either be disconnected, removed or restored to a safe or sanitary condition, as appropriate. The written notice shall fix a date certain for compliance with such order. It is a violation for any person to use or maintain defective equipment after receiving such notice.

 When any equipment or installation is to be disconnected, the code official shall give written notice of such disconnection and causes therefor within 24 hours to the serving utility, the owner and the occupant of the building, structure or premises.

 111.8 Enforcement in Municipal Court. Civil actions to enforce this chapter shall be brought exclusively in Seattle Municipal Court, except as otherwise required by law or court rule. In any civil action for a penalty, the City has the burden of proving by a preponderance of the evidence that a violation exists or existed; the issuance of a notice of violation or of an order following a review by the code official is not itself evidence that a violation exists.

 111.9 Judicial review. Because civil actions to enforce this code must be brought exclusively in Seattle Municipal Court pursuant to Section 111.8, orders of the code official, including notices of violation issued under this chapter, are not subject to judicial review pursuant to chapter 36.70C RCW.

Each day's violation shall constitute a separate offense.

 111.11 Additional relief. The code official may seek legal or equitable relief to enjoin any acts or practices and abate any condition when necessary to achieve compliance.

 EXCEPTION  : Intermittently operating ventilation systems: The mechanical system shall have controls for intermittent operation per Section 403.8.2 and shall supply at least the volume of outdoor air required for intermittent operation based on the combination of its delivered capacity (from Table 403.3 or Table 403.8.1), its ventilation effectiveness (from Table 403.8.5.1) and its fractional operation time (used in Table 403.8.5.1) using the formula:

 Where:

 Qf = outdoor air flow rate

 Qr = ventilation air requirement (from Table 403.3 or 403.8.1)

 = ventilation effectiveness (from Table 403.8.5.1)

 f = fractional operation time is the on-time for one cycle divided by the cycle time (used in Table 403.8.5.1)

</table> a  If the cycle time is three hours or less and the fractional operation time (f) is 50% of greater, then 1.0 can be used as the ventilation effectiveness.  Intermittent Mechanical Ventilation Airflow Calculation Examples:

 Example #1:  Calculating fan airflow based on Table 403.8.5.1 values:

 An intermittently operated whole house fan that serves a dwelling unit with a continuous ventilation requirement of 30 CFM (from Table 403.3 or 403.8.1) is controlled to operate with an on-time of 3 hours and off-time of 9 hours throughout the day.

 The minimum intermittent ventilation rate is calculated as follows:

 Qr = 30 CFM (from Table 403.3 or 403.8.1)

 Cycle time = 12 hours

 Fractional Operation Time (f) = 3 / (3+9) = 25%

 (where: f is equal to the on-time divided by the cycle time)

 (where: cycle time is equal to the on-time plus the off- time)

 Ventilation Effectiveness  = 0.33 (from Table 403.8.5.1)

 Qf = Qr / = 30 CFM / (0.33) / (25%) = 364 CFM

 Example #2:  Calculating fan airflow based on footnote a to Table 403.8.5.1:

 An intermittently operated whole house fan that serves a dwelling unit with a continuous ventilation requirement of 30 CFM (from Table 403.3 or 403.8.1) is controlled to operate with an on-time of 2 hours and off-time of 1 hour throughout the day.

 The minimum intermittent ventilation rate is calculated as follows:

 Qr = 30 CFM (from Table 403.3 or 403.8.1)

 Cycle time = 3 hours

 Fractional Operation Time (f) = 2 / (2+1) = 66% (this is greater than 50%)

 (where: f is equal to the on-time divided by the cycle time)

 (where: cycle time is equal to the on-time plus the off- time)

 Ventilation Effectiveness = 1.0 (per footnote a of Table 403.8.5.1)

 Qf = Qr / = 30 CFM / (1.0) / (66%) = 45 CFM

 See ASHRAE 62.2-2007 Appendix B for further explanation and examples.
