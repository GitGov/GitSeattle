 WHEREAS, where deemed appropriate by the appointing authority, the extraordinary work efforts of salaried employees who are exempt from or not covered by the overtime pay provisions of Fair labor Standards Act or the Washington Minimum Wage Act should be recognized by providing eligible employees with Merit Leave;

 NOW, THEREFORE,

 BE IT ORDAINED BY THE CITY OF SEATTLE AS FOLLOWS:

 Section 1. Section 4.20.320 of the Seattle Municipal code is amended as follows:

 SMC 4.20.320 Executive and Merit leave for eligible employees~~.~~

 A. Definitions~~.~~

 1. "Eligible employee" is any regular, salaried, professional, administrative, or executive employee who is exempt from or not covered by the overtime pay provisions of the Fair Labor Standards Act ~~,~~or the Washington Minimum Wage Act, and not otherwise excluded by this section. Eligible employees are those assigned to a classification or position which receives a top salary step equal to or greater than the top salary step of pay range 36.5, and those assigned to the Accountability Pay for Executives Program, Manager Compensation Program, or Strategic Advisor Program, regardless of pay group or zone, and are not entitled to receive overtime compensation or compensatory time for hours worked in excess of ~~forty (~~40~~)~~ in one~~(1)~~ workweek. In the Executive Department, the Law Department, and the Legislative Branch an "eligible employee" is any regular, salaried employee who is not entitled to receive overtime compensation or compensatory time under state or federal law.

 B. Policy~~.~~

 1. Executive leave: Unless specifically excluded in subsection C of this Section 4.20.320 ~~below~~, all eligible employees shall receive four ~~(4)~~ days of executive leave at the beginning of each calendar year. Executive leave must be used in the calendar year for which it is given.

 2. Eligible employees are expected to fulfill their professional responsibilities with no ~~expectation of receiving~~receipt of overtime or compensatory time off in lieu of overtime, regardless of the actual time it takes to perform assigned tasks. Eligible employees should be allowed discretion in structuring their workday to ensure that assigned tasks are completed. Eligible employees are not required to use paid vacation or sick leave to cover occasional absences of less than four ~~(4)~~ hours during any one ~~(1)~~ workday, and shall be paid their regular salary despite such absences. Eligible employees are expected to notify supervisors in advance of such absences and are expected to schedule such absences in a manner which will cause the least impact on work within their work unit.

 3. Merit leave: An Appointing Authority ~~A Department Director~~ may, at his or her discretion, award to eligible employees up to six ~~(6)~~ days of merit leave during the month of December of each year. Eligible employees must use any awarded merit leave in the subsequent calendar year and may not receive cash in lieu of merit leave.

 4. Out-of-class assignment: Employees who are otherwise eligible for overtime compensation who work out-of-class in an executive leave eligible position shall be eligible for executive and merit leave according to a minimum hour threshold and formula established and published by the Personnel Director and shall not receive overtime compensation when so assigned. This provision may apply to represented employees provided their bargaining agent has concurred in its application. ~~Part 2 of this subsection~~Subsection B.2 of this Section 4.20.320 becomes applicable to employees who work out-of-class in an executive leave eligible position after a specified threshold is reached as defined by the Personnel Director.

 C. Exclusions~~.~~

 1. ~~Employees who are not covered by or are otherwise exempt from provisions of the Fair Labor Standards Act and work in the Executive Department, the Legislative Department, the Law Department and~~ Department Directors who receive vacation allowance pursuant to ~~SMC~~ Section 4.34.030 shall be excluded from Section~~s~~ 4.20.315 and this Section 4.20.320. Officers and employees of the Seattle Municipal Court who are exempt from, or not otherwise covered by the Fair Labor Standards Act; and employees who are working pursuant to a collective bargaining agreement shall also be excluded from Section~~s~~ 4.20.315 and this Section 4.20.320 except as provided for in subsection ~~B4~~B.4 of this ~~section~~Section 4.20.320. All employees employed by the Seattle Public ~~library~~Library are specifically excluded from all provisions of Section~~s~~ 4.20.315 and this Section 4.20.320.

 2. Emergency Response Employees. In order to ensure continued effective response to public emergencies, all emergency response employees who work in position titles designated in ~~SMC~~subsection A.2. of this Section 4.20.320~~A2~~ shall be eligible for overtime or compensatory time at the rate of time-and-one-half for all hours worked in excess of ~~forty (~~40~~)~~ during one ~~(1)~~ workweek. Emergency response employees shall not receive executive or merit leave ~~benefit(s)~~benefits.

 3. Class Series Exception. If at least one ~~(1)~~ position title in a class series is below the 36.5 salary range, then all position titles in the class series up through and including the "senior" level will be eligible for overtime and shall not receive executive or merit leave ~~benefit(s)~~benefits. This Section does not apply to eligible employees in the Executive Department, the Law Department and the Legislative Branch.

~~D. Review. It is recognized that executive and merit leave are new personnel practices in The City of Seattle, and that it may be necessary to adjust aspects of this policy from time to time. Therefore, it shall be the responsibility of the Personnel Director to study the impact of the executive leave policy and, when appropriate, make recommendations to the Council regarding its impact, and propose any appropriate rules to implement the provisions of this act. The Personnel Director shall make a report to the Council regarding implementation of this policy twenty-four (24) months after the effective date of the ordinance codified in Sections 4.20.315 and 4.20.320.~~

 Section 2. The award of merit and/or executive leave in departments and branches not previously covered by Section 4.20.320 is hereby ratified and confirmed. Such leave may only be used during continued employment and no employee may receive cash in lieu of such leave. The appointing authorities in those departments and branches are authorized to place conditions and limitations on the use of such leave.

 Section 3. This ordinance shall take effect and be in force 30 days from and after its approval by the Mayor, but if not approved and returned by the Mayor within 10 days after presentation, it shall take effect as provided by Seattle Municipal Code Section 1.04.020.
