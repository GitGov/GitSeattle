 This Agreement regarding a Restrictive Covenant and Public Access Rights at the High Point Neighborhood Center ("Agreement") is made and entered into by and between the following parties:

 The City of Seattle ("the City"), a first class city of the State of Washington, acting by and through its Department of Parks and Recreation ("DPR") and its Superintendent (the "Superintendent"); and

 Neighborhood House, Incorporated, a Washington non-profit corporation ("NH"); and

 Neighborhood House High Point QALICB ("NH High Point"), a Washington non-profit corporation and an affiliate of NH.

 Except as otherwise stated, NH and NH High Point are co- obligees under this agreement and are referred to collectively as "Neighborhood House".

 I. PURPOSE OF AGREEMENT

 WHEREAS, NH is a non-profit organization founded in 1906 with a mission of helping diverse communities of people with limited resources attain their goals for self sufficiency, financial independence and community building; and

 WHEREAS, NH has successfully collaborated in the past with Seattle Housing Authority to create the New Holly and Rainier Vista housing redevelopments, national models for providing low-income housing in a mixed- housing community development; and

 WHEREAS, NH and Seattle Housing Authority are currently collaborating on the High Point redevelopment project, which will provide low-income housing in a mixed-income community in the heart of West Seattle; and

 WHEREAS, Neighborhood House is nearing completion of a capital campaign to raise funds for the purpose of designing and constructing a community center in the High Point redevelopment neighborhood (the "High Point Neighborhood Center"), on land owned by NH High Point which building, once constructed, will be owned by NH High Point and leased to NH and Seattle Housing Authority; and

 WHEREAS, construction of the High Point Neighborhood Center will make it possible for NH to expand its current provision of social services specifically targeted to serve low-income and special needs populations; and

 WHEREAS, construction of the High Point Neighborhood Center will make it possible for Neighborhood House to provide expanded recreational and educational opportunities and programs to the High Point redevelopment neighborhood and general public; and

 WHEREAS, providing parks and recreational facilities for the general public is a fundamental government purpose; and

 WHEREAS, the City of Seattle owns and pays for the operation of community centers that provide space for community gathering, play, education and recreation; and

 WHEREAS, a community center in the High Point redevelopment neighborhood will help further the Department of Parks and Recreation's mission "to provide safe and welcoming opportunities to play, learn, contemplate and build community;" and

 WHEREAS, the City of Seattle has a fundamental public interest in guaranteeing that low-income families in the High Point neighborhood and greater Seattle area have access to necessary support and services such as job counseling, family services, social workers and English language classes;

 Now therefore, in consideration of the foregoing, and the mutual benefits and covenants herein, the City and Neighborhood House agree as follows:

 Restrictive Covenant: The covenants and obligations that bind and restrict the use of the Property, as defined and described in Section 4 below.

 Use Period: The period of time beginning on the date when the construction of the High Point Neighborhood Center is completed and the Center is open and available for public use, and ending ten (10) years later, except as it may be extended pursuant to Section 11 hereof.

 3. TERM OF AGREEMENT

 3.1 This Agreement shall be effective when authorized by Seattle City Council and fully executed and delivered by both parties, which may be in separate counterparts, and shall continue in full force and effect until the Use Period has expired or until otherwise terminated as permitted herein.

 4.1 In consideration of the City's promises herein, Neighborhood House hereby covenants and agrees to abide by restrictions on the development and use of the Property as follows:

 A. Neighborhood House will use the Property solely for the purpose of developing and constructing the High Point Neighborhood Center and for no other purpose whatsoever.

 B. For the duration of the Use Period, Neighborhood House will maintain and operate the Center as a community center offering recreational and educational activities, programs and services.

 B. Within 15 days of receiving the invoice, the Superintendent or his designee shall authorize payment or notify NH High Point of any deficiencies in the request or additional information required.

 Within 30 days after the Superintendent or his designee has approved the invoice, the City will issue payment of $500,000 to NH High Point.

 B. Neither the Restrictive Covenant nor any provision of this Agreement is in conflict with any provision of any other agreement or instrument by which NH and NH High Point are bound or to which the Property is subject (including but not limited to any debts that are secured by the Property), nor shall the execution, delivery or performance of this Restrictive Covenant and Agreement constitute an event of default under any such agreement or instrument.

 14. RECORDING AND PRIORITY

 14.1 This Agreement shall be duly recorded with King County. Neighborhood House warrants and covenants that the Restrictive Covenant shall have priority over all encumbrances on the Property, other than those in favor of the City and any future exceptions to which the City subordinates this Agreement by instrument hereafter recorded, to the extent of such subordination.

 15. NONDISCRIMINATION

 15.1 Neighborhood House shall comply, and cause all contractors and subcontractors working on the Property to comply, with all applicable equal employment opportunity and nondiscrimination laws of the United States, the State of Washington, and the City of Seattle, including but not limited to Chapters 14.04, 14.10 and 20.42 of the Seattle Municipal Code (SMC), to the extent applicable, and rules, regulations, orders and directives of the associated administrative agencies and their officers.

 16. ASSIGNMENT OR TRANSFER

 16.1 In the event that NH High Point assigns or transfers its rights and ownership in the Property during the term of this Agreement, NH agrees to completely and faithfully assume and fulfill all responsibilities and obligations allocated to NH High Point individually under this Agreement. Neither NH nor NH Highpoint will assign or transfer its rights and obligations under this agreement to any person or entity not a party to this Agreement without the prior written approval of the Superintendent.

 17. DEFAULT

 17.1 If Neighborhood House fails to perform when required any obligation or breach any term of this Agreement, the City shall provide written notice to NH and NH High Point, specifying the nature of the breach and the reasonable number of days (a minimum of 30 days, but in any event the City shall not be required to allow more than sixty (60) days) after the date of the notice within which such breach must be cured. Unless Neighborhood House shall fully cure all breaches specified in such notice within the time allowed, Neighborhood House shall be in Default.

 17.2 In case of Default by either Neighborhood House collectively, or by NH High Point or NH individually, the City may exercise remedies as specified in Section 20, or specified under any applicable provision of this Agreement. In addition to or in lieu of the foregoing, the City shall be entitled to all remedies permitted from time to time by the laws of the State of Washington. The City's rights and remedies hereunder are not exclusive, but cumulative, and the City's exercise of any right or remedy due to Neighborhood House's failure to perform any covenant or condition of this Agreement shall not be deemed a waiver of, or alter, affect or prejudice any other right or remedy that the City may have under this Agreement or by law or in equity.

 18. DEFAULT BY CITY AND REMEDIES

 18.1 If, within sixty (60) days after Neighborhood House shall have timely satisfied all conditions to the City's obligation for payment hereunder, the City shall not have tendered full payment hereunder, then Neighborhood House may either (1) terminate this Agreement by written notice to the City within 30 days, in which case neither party shall have any liability or obligation hereunder; or (2) pursue any remedy available at law or in equity for enforcement of this Agreement, provided that the City shall not be liable for damages or any other monetary remedy in excess of the total price stated hereunder, plus interest as may be allowed by law.

 19. TERMINATION

 19.1 This Agreement shall continue in effect until the earliest to occur of:

 A. The expiration of the Use Period; or

 B. If the City elects to claim liquidated damages after Default in accordance with Section 20 hereof, the date on which the City receives full payment of all liquidated damages; or

 19.2 The City may terminate this Agreement in the event that, prior to payment by the City hereunder, Neighborhood House is in Default, or the City, in its reasonable discretion, determines that Neighborhood House will be unable to timely complete the construction of the High Point Neighborhood Center.

 20. LIQUIDATED DAMAGES

 20.1 The parties understand and agree that the City's ability to obtain value from this Agreement is conditioned upon the development and construction of the Property and the completion, opening, and operation of the High Point Neighborhood Center. From the nature of this Agreement, it would be impracticable and extremely difficult to fix the actual damages sustained as a result of the failure of Neighborhood House to complete the Center or make it available for uses contemplated herein, or sustained as a result of Neighborhood House's use of the Property for purposes contrary to the terms of the Restrictive Covenant. As a result, the parties agree that in the circumstances expressly set forth in this section and other applicable sections of this Agreement, the City shall have the right to recover, at its option, liquidated damages in the amounts set forth herein, which amounts the parties agree are a reasonable estimate of the damage to the City, and are intended to fairly measure the loss to the City and not to be punitive in nature.

 20.2 In the event that Neighborhood House fails to complete the High Point Neighborhood Center or otherwise fails to cause the Use Period to commence by the date required herein, NH agrees to pay the City on demand liquidated damages in the amount of the greater of FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND AND NO/100 DOLLARS ($500,000) plus interest, or the amount equal to the total of any purchase money already paid by the City, plus interest. Interest shall accrue from the date the City tenders any payment under this Agreement until the date of full repayment at the rate applied during the same period of time to the participating funds of the Consolidated Cash Portfolio of the City of Seattle.

 20.3 Additionally, in the event of Default after the beginning of the Use Period and prior to the expiration of the Use Period, NH agrees to pay the City on demand liquidated damages in the amount of FIFTY THOUSAND AND NO/100 DOLLARS ($50,000) for each year remaining in the Use Period (prorated for any Partial Use Year based upon the number of months remaining) plus interest on that amount, accrued as described in Section 20.2, for each year remaining in the Use Period.

 20.4 NH shall be solely liable for any liquidated damages that the City may be entitled to under the terms of this Agreement, regardless of whether the liability is incurred as a result of default or breach by either NH or NH High Point individually, or by Neighborhood House collectively. The City may directly pursue against NH any remedy allowed under this Agreement or at law. Any future sale or transfer of the Property shall not extinguish NH's obligations hereunder, nor shall it impair the City's ability to pursue liquidated damages from NH.

 20.5 After receipt of liquidated damages in cleared funds, the City shall, within a reasonable time, record an instrument terminating the Restrictive Covenant and this Agreement shall be terminated.

 20.6 The City may, at its option, set off any liquidated damages under this Section against any amount otherwise payable or distributable by the City to NH, whether or not in relation to this Agreement or the Property.

 21. COMPLIANCE WITH LAW

 21.1 Neighborhood House shall comply at its sole expense with all applicable laws of the United States and the State of Washington; the Charter, Municipal Code and ordinances of the City of Seattle; and rules, regulations, orders and directives of their administrative agencies and the officers thereof (all of the foregoing are referred to as "applicable laws".) Neighborhood House shall require all contractors and subcontractors working on the Property to comply with all applicable laws.

 21.2 Neighborhood House represents and warrants that any activities in connection with the development of the Property prior to this Agreement have been in compliance with all applicable laws.

 21.3 Neighborhood House shall defend and indemnify the City and its officers and employees from and against any claim, demand, liability or loss resulting from the failure of Grantors or of any contractor or subcontractor to comply with applicable laws.

 22. Indemnity

 22.1 Neighborhood House shall have control over and responsibility for the development, construction, operation, and maintenance of the Property, the Center and the services provided therein. As a result, NH agrees to defend, indemnify, and hold the City of Seattle, its elected officials, officers, employees and agents harmless from any and all damages, claims, liabilities, losses and/or costs of any kind, including attorney's fees, that arise in any way from the development, construction, financing, operation, maintenance or use of the Property and the Center, including without limitation any public use under this Agreement of the Center and adjacent grounds on the Property.

 22.2 This clause applies to claims, liabilities, costs, losses and/or damages of any kind notwithstanding any acts, omissions or negligence of the City or its officers, officials, employees, contractors or agents; provided, that nothing herein shall be construed as requiring either NH and NH High Point to indemnify the City against liability for bodily injury or damage to property caused by or resulting from the sole negligence of the City or of any of its officers, elected officials, employees or agents, and further provided, that if RCW 4.24.115 (or successor provision) shall apply to any claim for any such damage or injury, then to the extent required by such statute, (1) this indemnity shall not apply in case of any liability for damages arising out of bodily injury to persons or damage to property caused or resulting from the sole negligence of the City, its agents or employees, and (2) in case of liability for damages arising out of bodily injury to persons or damage to property caused by or resulting from the concurrent negligence of (a) the City or its agents or employees, and (b) Neighborhood House and or its agents or employees, this indemnity shall apply only to the extent of Neighborhood House's negligence. The indemnification obligation set forth in this section shall survive the expiration or earlier termination of this Agreement.

 22.3 For purposes of this Section, Neighborhood House waives, solely with respect to City, its immunity under RCW Title 51, Industrial Insurance. Neighborhood House and City acknowledge that this waiver has been specifically negotiated and that City would not have entered into this Agreement absent this waiver.

 This Section 22 shall survive termination of this Agreement for the duration of applicable laws relating to limitations of actions.

 23. APPLICABLE LAW; VENUE

 23.1 This Agreement shall be construed and interpreted in accordance with the laws of the State of Washington. The venue of any action brought hereunder shall be in the Superior Court for King County.

 24. HEADINGS

 24.1 The headings used in this Agreement are for convenience only and do not define or limit the contents.
