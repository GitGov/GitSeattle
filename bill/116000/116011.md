 ORDINANCE _________________

 AN ORDINANCE stating the City Council's intent not to propose or to enact any ordinance that would have the effect of approving any amendment to the Premises Use & Occupancy Agreement between the City of Seattle and the Professional Basketball Club, L.L.C. allowing the Seattle SuperSonics to vacate the KeyArena prior to September 30, 2010.

 WHEREAS, on February 14, 1994, the City Council passed, and the Mayor signed, Seattle Ordinance 117049, under which the Seattle Center Director was authorized to enter into a Premises Use & Occupancy Agreement with SSI Sports, Inc. ("SSI"), the corporation that then owned the Seattle SuperSonics professional basketball team; and

 WHEREAS, Ordinance 117049 specifically provided that the term of the Premises Use & Occupancy Agreement would commence on or about October 1, 1995, and would expire on September 30, 2010; and

 WHEREAS, on or about March 14, 1994, SSI and the City of Seattle executed the Premises Use & Occupancy Agreement, including a termination date of September 30, 2010; and

 WHEREAS, The Professional Basketball Club, L.L.C. became a party to the Premises Use & Occupancy Agreement, as amended, through an Instrument of Assumption executed on October 23, 2006; and

 WHEREAS, the Seattle SuperSonics have played professional basketball in Seattle for 40 years, including winning a National Basketball Association championship in 1979 with the starting five of Gus Williams, Dennis Johnson, Jack Sikma, Lonnie Shelton and John Johnson; and

 WHEREAS, the Seattle Storm have played professional basketball in Seattle for eight years and won a championship in 2004 with the starting five of Sue Bird, Lauren Jackson, Kamila Vodichkova, Betty Lennox and Sheri Sam; and

 WHEREAS, the Seattle community has been immeasurably enriched through the volunteer work of Seattle SuperSonics players; and

 WHEREAS, the Sonics and Storm Foundation has made financial contributions to build or refurbish 26 basketball courts through the Neighbor Hoops program; and

 WHEREAS, in 1993, the Seattle City Council approved a contract for the renovation of the Seattle Center Coliseum; and

 WHEREAS, as a condition of that approval, the Council sought a 20- year lease term from SSI to coincide with the length of the debt financing; and

 WHEREAS, the Council approved the contract for renovation with only a 15-year lease term, because of the cultural, civic and community benefits derived from having the Seattle Supersonics play their home games in the City of Seattle; and

 WHEREAS, the lease term was a material term of the contract and a principal incentive for Council approval of the original contract; and

 WHEREAS, the principal benefit the City of Seattle receives under the Premises & Use Agreement is the promise that the Seattle SuperSonics will play all of their home games at the KeyArena; and

 WHEREAS, the economic cost to the City of Seattle caused by the Seattle SuperSonics vacating the KeyArena earlier than the term provided for in the Premises Use & Occupancy Agreement is impossible to measure because of intangible factors such as goodwill, prestige, trade, commerce, and cultural and general economic benefit to the City; and

 WHEREAS, the City Council must, by ordinance, approve any amendment to the Premises Use & Occupancy Agreement that would allow that Agreement to expire prior to September 30, 2010; NOW, THEREFORE,

 BE IT ORDAINED BY THE CITY OF SEATTLE AS FOLLOWS:

 Section 1. It is the City Council's intent not to propose or to enact any ordinance that would have the effect of approving any amendment to the Premises Use & Occupancy Agreement between the City of Seattle and The Professional Basketball Club, L.L.C. allowing the Seattle SuperSonics to vacate the KeyArena prior to September 30, 2010.
