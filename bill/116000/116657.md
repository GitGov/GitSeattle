 11.16.317 Establishing, expanding, reducing, and dissolving restricted parking zones

 A. The Director of Transportation or ~~his or her~~the Director's designee shall consider whether a restricted parking zone, within a designated area, would promote certain benefits or would result in adverse impacts.

 1. Benefits that may lead to establishing an RPZ ~~may~~ include, but are not limited to: increased access for area residents, reduced traffic congestion, increased traffic or pedestrian safety, reduced air or noise pollution, reduced commuter parking in neighborhoods, prevention of blighted areas, and promoting the use of alternative modes of transportation.

 2. Adverse impacts that may prevent ~~implementation~~ establishing an RPZ include, but are not limited to: transferring a parking problem to a different area, inability to effectively enforce program restrictions, lack of alternative transportation modes, and availability of simpler, cheaper or more effective solutions.

 3. Regardless of potential benefits or adverse impacts that may result ~~from creating an RPZ in any downtown zone including all zones contained in Map 1A of Ch. 23.49 SMC~~, the Seattle Department of Transportation will not install RPZs in ~~such zones~~any downtown zone, including all zones contained in Map 1A of Chapter 23.49 SMC, in part~~,~~ because of high demand and multiple, competing needs for on- street parking.

 B. The Director of Transportation may establish a new or expand an existingrestricted parking zone whenever ~~seventy-five (~~75~~)~~ percent or more of the capacity of the streets available for parking on ten ~~(10)~~ contiguous blocks (and/or ~~twenty (~~20~~)~~ block faces) in such designated area is generally occupied; over ~~thirty-five (~~35~~)~~ percent of the vehicles parked on the street in the area are not owned by residents of the designated area; a strong and effective community engagement effort indicating that generally stakeholders in the designated area have reviewed and support the restricted parking zone, which could include a petition signed by a majority of the residents in the designated area in support of the restricted parking zone ; and the public interest would be served. In cases where the criteria listed above are not met, the Director of Transportation is authorized to establish a restricted parking zone when, in ~~his or her~~the Director's judgment, the parking problem will be ameliorated by a restricted parking zone and the public interest would be served.

 C. The Director of Transportation or ~~his or her~~the Director's designee is authorized to engage affected and interested community stakeholders to review and assist in refining any future RPZ proposals.

 1. The public information and involvement program may include department presentations to business and community organizations, information distribution through the City's web site, news releases and related media, direct mailings of informational materials, facilitated meetings, sounding boards, walking tours, surveys, and other techniques as appropriate to the scale of the proposal.

 2. Prior to the Director of Transportation's decision to establish, not to establish, to dissolve ~~an RPZ~~, ~~or~~ to expand, or to reduce an RPZ by more than two ~~(2)~~ contiguous blocks, the Seattle Department of Transportation shall hold ~~an administrative~~a public hearing where it will provide interested persons an opportunity to submit written and spoken comment into the public record.
