 This project constructs a new westbound off-ramp from I-5 and I-90 via the current South Atlantic Street Overpass, leaving South Atlantic Street's current eastbound lanes intact. Improvements will be made at the intersections of First Avenue South and South Atlantic Street and Occidental Avenue and South Atlantic Street. Additionally, a grade- separated crossing at South Royal Brougham Way will be built which will eliminate vehicle, freight, and pedestrian conflicts with trains at South Royal Brougham Way and Third Avenue South. Funding shown below pays for SDOT staff involvement in the project in the areas of project facilitation and coordination, establishment of design criteria, and technical advice and reviews.

 This program addresses capital improvements needed on water infrastructure as a result of the 2006 winter storms which were declared a federal emergency. The majority of this work takes place in the watersheds, as the storms had the most lasting impact in those areas. This work is expected to be reimbursed by the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA).

 This project relocates the Bow Lake Pipeline away from SeaTac Airport onto a new road along the north perimeter of

 the airport property. The original pipeline crossed both runways, and was not compatible with the third runway. As a

 result it was determined that the pipeline should be relocated away from the runways. The Port of Seattle is bearing the

 majority of the costs, and the amounts shown below are SPU's contribution to the project. The certainty of the cost

 estimate is high, and SPU's Asset Management Committee has approved the project.
