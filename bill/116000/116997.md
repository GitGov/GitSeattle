 WHEREAS, the Mayor submitted a list of proposed position modifications as part of the 2011 Proposed Budget; and

 WHEREAS, by Resolution 24964, the City Council adopted the concept of implementing the City's Capital Improvement Program through appropriations in budgets adopted annually to the greatest extent feasible; and

 WHEREAS, the proposed budget for 2011 includes certain appropriations for capital programs that are described in the 2011-2016 Proposed Capital Improvement Program; and

 WHEREAS, the City's 2011-2016 Capital Improvement Program, in conjunction with the Capital Facilities, Utility and Transportation Elements of the Comprehensive Plan, is in accordance with the State Growth Management Act; NOW, THEREFORE,

 BE IT ORDAINED BY THE CITY OF SEATTLE AS FOLLOWS:

 Section 1. (a) In accordance with RCW 35.32A.050, the City Council has modified the proposed budget submitted by the Mayor.

 (b) The expenditure allowances for the budget control levels in Attachment A to this ordinance, as restricted by the budget provisos included in Clerk File (C.F.) 311072, are adopted and constitute the appropriations for the City's annual budget for 2011.

 (c) The expenditure allowance for each budget control level in Attachment A may be used only for the purpose listed in Attachment A for that budget control level, unless transferred pursuant to Seattle Municipal Code (SMC) Chapter 5.08. Each budget control level listed in Attachment A is a "budget item" as that term is used in SMC Section 5.08.020. Use of any amount of any appropriation restricted by one or more of the provisos in C.F. 311072 for any other purpose than that stated, or for any purpose expressly excluded, or in violation of any condition specified by proviso, whether by transfer pursuant to SMC Section 5.08.020 or by any other means, is prohibited.

 (d) Unspent funds for the Executive Department Office of Housing's Low-Income Housing Fund 16400 Budget Control Level appropriated by Section 1(b) shall carry forward to subsequent fiscal years until they are exhausted or abandoned by ordinance.

 (e) Unspent funds for the Pike Place Market Renovation Budget Control Level appropriated by Section 1(b) shall carry forward to subsequent fiscal years until they are exhausted or abandoned by ordinance.

 (f) The revenue estimates for 2011 contained in the Mayor's 2011 Proposed Budget, filed in C.F. 311070, as modified by the changes of the City Council in C.F. 311072, are adopted.

 Section 2. The 2011-2016 Proposed Capital Improvement Program submitted by the Mayor, filed in C.F. 311071, as modified by the changes of the City Council in C.F. 311072, is adopted as the City's six-year Capital Improvement Program ("CIP").

 Section 3. (a) The officer and employee position modifications in Attachment B, including the creation of some positions exempt from civil service, are adopted effective January 4, 2011.

 (b) The City by enacting Ordinance 123308 established a position list that became effective as of January 1, 2010. Subsection 3(a) of this ordinance modifies that list. It is anticipated that the Personnel Department will submit a proposed list of the City's regular positions for each department or office as of January 4, 2011, to the City Council for possible action in early 2011. The proposed list should reflect (i) the modifications made in Subsection 3(a) of this ordinance that take effect on January 4, 2011; (ii) the reclassifications of regular positions made by the Personnel Director from January 1, 2010, through January 3, 2011; and (iii) the creation, modification, or abrogation of regular positions by ordinances effective from January 1, 2010, through January 3, 2011.

 Section 4. (a) Subject to the conditions in Section 1 above, the appropriation of money in the budget adopted by this ordinance, for a budget control level that includes a program or project assigned a project identification number in the 2011-2016 Adopted CIP, constitutes authority for the designated City department, commission, or office (after compliance with the State Environmental Policy Act) to acquire personal property; obtain options to acquire real property; negotiate to acquire right-of-way and other real property interests; prepare plans and designs; demolish, construct, make improvements; and obtain any ancillary services, including, without limitation, planning, engineering, design, appraisal, escrow, title insurance, construction, inspection, environmental audits, and remediation appraisals or other reviews; all in order to carry out the project or program substantially as described in the 2011-2016 Adopted CIP. Each department may obtain the authorized services or property using City staff or by contract as authorized in Section 6. Where projects or programs are identified in the 2011-2016 Adopted CIP to be carried out by other entities wholly or in part with City funds, the appropriation constitutes authority to provide such funds to such other entities for such purposes, subject to applicable laws and ordinances.

 (b) None of the appropriations in the 2011 Adopted Budget may be spent on capital projects or programs unless the projects or programs are specifically identified and assigned a project identification number in the 2011-2016 Adopted CIP or are added to the 2011-2016 Adopted CIP by a future amending ordinance. This prohibition includes, but is not limited to, spending on the planning, acquisition, construction, reconstruction, repair, replacement, rehabilitation, or improvement of streets, roads, highways, sidewalks, street and road lighting systems, traffic signals, bridges, domestic water systems, storm and sanitary sewer systems, parks, recreational facilities, law enforcement facilities, fire protection facilities, trails, libraries, administrative or judicial facilities, river or waterway flood control projects, or power transmission or generation facilities.

 (c) Without future Council authorization by ordinance, expenditures in 2011 on any project or program identified and assigned a project identification number in the 2011-2016 Adopted CIP for Seattle City Light, Seattle Public Utilities, or the Seattle Department of Transportation, other than expenditures pursuant to unspent capital appropriations carried forward from 2010 into 2011 in accordance with RCW 35.32A.080 and allocated to the same project or program, shall not exceed by more than $1,000,000 the amount shown as the Appropriations Total in the 2011 column for that project or program. The City Budget Office shall certify to the Chair of the City Council Finance and Budget Committee a list of those unspent capital appropriations not subject to the expenditure restriction imposed by this subsection by May 1, 2011. The list shall include the project identification number and the dollar amount by project or program not subject to the expenditure restriction, at minimum. The Chair of the City Council Finance and Budget Committee shall then file this certification with the City Clerk.

 (d) Moneys appropriated from funds, subfunds, accounts, and subaccounts in which are deposited the proceeds derived from the issuance of bonded obligations shall be expended only in accordance with the terms, conditions, and restrictions of ordinances authorizing such obligations and establishing the respective funds.

 (e) The 2011-2016 Adopted CIP is part of the 2011 Adopted Budget and identifies, among other projects, those capital projects funded wholly or in part from the proceeds of the taxes authorized in RCW 82.46.010 and/or RCW 82.46.035, and/or from the proceeds of bonds, for the repayment of which tax revenues under RCW 82.46.010 have been pledged. Such taxes are intended to be in addition to other funds that may be reasonably available for such capital projects.

 (f) The portions of the 2011-2016 Adopted CIP pertaining to Seattle City Light and Seattle Public Utilities, as those portions of the 2011-2016 Adopted CIP may be amended from time to time, are adopted as systems or plans of additions to, and betterments and extensions of, the facilities, physical plants, or systems of Seattle City Light and Seattle Public Utilities, respectively.

 (g) The Director of the Department of Finance and Administrative Services and the City's Director of Finance are authorized to draw and pay the necessary warrants or checks and to make any necessary transfers among funds and accounts.

 (h) Except as limited by this Section or by Section 1 above or by any other ordinance, the funds appropriated in the 2011 Adopted Budget shall be subject to transfer for use with other projects as provided in SMC Chapter 5.08.

 Section 5. The Mayor or, at the Mayor's request, the head of the department that is designated to carry out a project for and on behalf of The City of Seattle, is authorized to submit applications as may be deemed appropriate to the United States of America, or any of its departments, and the State of Washington, or any of its departments, for financial assistance in carrying out the authorized projects included in the 2011-2016 Adopted CIP; to make for and on behalf of the City all assurances, promises, representations, and consent to suit, and/or covenants to comply with any applicable regulations of the United States relating to implementation of the projects; to act in connection with the applications as the authorized representative of the City; to provide additional information as may be required; and to prepare plans for implementation of terms and conditions as may accompany financial assistance, provided that the submission of an application shall not result in the making of a contract, in incurring of any indebtedness, or in the acceptance of moneys imposing any duties or obligations upon the City except as shall be authorized by this or other ordinance.

 Section 6. The Director of Transportation, the Superintendent of Parks and Recreation, the Director of the Office of Arts and Cultural Affairs, the Superintendent of City Light, the Director of Seattle Public Utilities, the Director of the Department of Finance and Administrative Services, the City Librarian, the Chief Technology Officer, and the Director of the Seattle Center Department are authorized to negotiate for and enter into non-public works contracts, within their appropriation authority, to obtain property and services authorized in Section 4 to carry out those capital projects and programs included in the 2011-2016 Adopted CIP and assigned to their respective departments or offices.

 Section 7. Effective January 1, 2011, a new barrier fund entitled the Finance and Administrative Services Fund is created in the City Treasury.

 (a) The purpose of the Finance and Administrative Services Fund is to account for revenues, expenditures, assets and liabilities associated with the operations of the Department of Finance and Administrative Services' operations.

 (b) The Finance and Administrative Services Fund shall receive authorized associated revenues including, but not limited to: City levied fees and taxes; interfund transfers; revenues from federal, state, county, or other grants or transfers; private funding, donations or gifts; revenues from private businesses or individuals; and other monies as authorized by ordinance.

 (c) The Director of Finance and Administrative Services is responsible for administering the Finance and Administrative Services Fund. The Director of Finance is authorized to create other Subfunds, Accounts or Subaccounts as may be needed to implement the Fund's purpose and intent. Investment earnings attributable to the subfunds within the Finance and Administrative Services Fund shall be deposited into the appropriate subfunds.

 (d) All assets and liabilities in the Fleets and Facilities Fund shall transfer to the Finance and Administrative Services Fund.

 (e) All assets and liabilities in the General Subfund associated with the Department of Executive Administration shall transfer to the Finance and Administrative Services Fund.

 (g) The Fleets and Facilities Fund is abolished, effective January 1, 2011.

 Section 8. The Mayor and the City Council find that the General Fund's 2011 contribution to the Park and Recreation Fund exceeds the requirements established in Article XI, Section 3 of the City Charter.

 Section 9. The provisions of this ordinance are declared to be separate and severable. If one or more of the provisions of this ordinance shall be declared by any court of competent jurisdiction to be contrary to law, the provision shall be severed from the rest of the ordinance and all other provisions shall remain valid.

 Section 10. This ordinance shall take effect and be in force thirty (30) days from and after its approval by the Mayor, but if not approved and returned by the Mayor within ten (10) days after presentation, it shall take effect as provided by Seattle Municipal Code Section 1.04.020.
