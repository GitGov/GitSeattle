 ORDINANCE _________________

 AN ORDINANCE relating to Seattle Public Utilities; authorizing the purchase of approximately 67.7 acres of real property in Section 36, Township 23 North, Range 8 East, W.M. in King County, Washington, commonly called the Mount Washington property, adjacent to the Cedar River Municipal Watershed, from the Washington State Parks and Recreation Commission, granting a recreational trail easement over a portion of the property, and ratifying and confirming certain prior acts.

 WHEREAS, the City, acting through and by Seattle Public Utilities ("SPU"), owns and manages the more than 92,000-acre Cedar River Municipal Watershed ("Watershed"), which is both a source of unfiltered drinking water for Seattle and surrounding communities and home to many species of fish and wildlife; and

 WHEREAS, the State of Washington, through its Parks and Recreation Commission ("State"), desires to sell approximately 67.7 acres of undeveloped real property it currently owns and manages within Iron Horse Park, commonly referred to as the Mount Washington property ("Property"), adjacent to the northern boundary of the Watershed and within a portion of the hydrographic boundary not yet owned by the City; and

 WHEREAS, SPU has determined that purchasing the Property will achieve its critical management objectives for the Watershed including: (1) increasing control of lands draining to the municipal water supply, (2) avoiding future risk and costs associated with illegal trespass in and around the Watershed, (3) reducing risk and liability costs associated with State's future construction of a proposed recreational trail near the Watershed, which may cross a small portion of the Property, and (4) providing a sustainably long term partnership with State; and

 WHEREAS, SPU and State have agreed to a Purchase and Sale Agreement which includes SPU granting an approximately ten-foot wide and 3,300-foot long trail easement across a small portion of the Property for the future construction of a proposed recreational trail by State; NOW, THEREFORE,

 BE IT ORDAINED BY THE CITY OF SEATTLE AS FOLLOWS:

 Section 2. The Property acquired pursuant to this ordinance shall be placed under the jurisdiction of Seattle Public Utilities.

 Section 3. Any act pursuant to the authority and prior to the effective date of this ordinance is hereby ratified and confirmed.

 Section 4. This ordinance shall take effect and be in force 30 days from and after its approval by the Mayor, but if not approved and returned by the Mayor within ten days after presentation, it shall take effect as provided by Seattle Municipal Code Section 1.04.020.
