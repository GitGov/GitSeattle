 This First Amendment ("Amendment") is made as of the date of last signature below by PACIFIC BUILDING PARTNERS LLC, a Washington limited liability company ("Landlord"), and THE CITY OF SEATTLE, a municipal corporation of the State of Washington, acting by and through the SEATTLE CITY EMPLOYEES' RETIREMENT SYSTEM ("Tenant"). RECITALS: A. Pursuant to a Lease between LHT Corporation, a Washington corporation ("Original Landlord"), as landlord, and Tenant, as tenant, dated as of April 8, 2005 (the "Lease"), Original Landlord leased to Tenant certain premises having an agreed area of 8,226 rentable square feet (the "Existing Premises") located on the 10th floor of the building commonly known as Pacific Building (the "Building"), located at 720 Third Avenue in Seattle, Washington. The Existing Premises are commonly referred to as Suite 1000 of the Building and consist of the entire 10th floor of the Building. The Existing Premises and the Building are more particularly described in the Lease. Capitalized terms used in this Amendment and not defined in this Amendment shall have the meanings given to them in the Lease. B. Landlord purchased the Building from Original Landlord and is the current holder of Original Landlord's interests under the Lease. C. The Term of the Lease expired on April 30, 2010 and has continued on month-to- month basis. Subject to the terms and conditions of this Amendment, Landlord and Tenant have agreed to reinstate the Lease, extend the Term and relocate Tenant to premises located on the 9th floor of the Building, also having an agreed area of 8,226 rentable square feet, and consisting of the entire 9th floor of the Building (the "Substitute Premises"). The Substitute Premises are more particularly shown on the floor plan attached to this Amendment as Exhibit A. AGREEMENT: In consideration of the mutual covenants and promises in this Amendment, and in the Lease, Landlord and Tenant agree as follows: 1. Substitution of Premises. Effective as of the "Relocation Date" (defined below), Tenant will vacate and surrender possession of the Existing Premises to Landlord in accordance with the terms of the Lease and Tenant will take occupancy of the Substitute Premises. From and after the Relocation Date, all references in the Lease to the "Premises" shall mean the Substitute Premises. Effective as of the Relocation Date, the floor plan of the Substitute Premises attached to this Amendment as Exhibit A shall replace the floor plan of the Existing Premises attached to the Lease as Exhibit B. For purposes of this Amendment, the term "Relocation Date" means the first to occur of the following events: (i) four (4) business days after Landlord notifies Tenant that the "Tenant Improvements" (as defined in Paragraph 7 below) are substantially complete, or (ii) the date on which Tenant opens for business in the ordinary course in the Substitute Premises. The estimated Relocation Date is September 1, 2010 (the "Estimated Relocation Date"). If Landlord is unable to deliver possession of the Substitute Premises to Tenant, with the Tenant Improvements substantially completed, on the Estimated Relocation Date, Landlord shall not be liable for any damage caused by failing to deliver possession and this Lease shall not be void or voidable. For purposes of this Amendment, the term "substantially complete" means the completion of the Tenant Improvements, subject to completion or correction of "punch list" items that are of such a nature that they do not materially interfere with or impair Tenant's use of the Premises as general business offices. Until the Relocation Date, all terms and conditions of the Lease and this Amendment will apply to Tenant's use and occupancy of the Existing Premises, except the substitution of the floor plan and legal description of the Premises, which will only be effective as of the Relocation Date. 2. Lease Term. The Term of the Lease is hereby extended for a period of one hundred thirty two (132) months, commencing on September 1, 2010, and expiring on August 31, 2021 (the "New Term"). 3. Rent. Effective on the first day of the New Term (September 1, 2010), the Base Rent payable by Tenant pursuant to the Lease during the New Term shall be as follows:

(d) Paragraph (i) of the "Arbitration of Market Rate Disputes" paragraph in Section 22 of Part B is amended by deleting Tenant's right to withdraw its Notice of Exercise following the exchange and opening of the envelopes. 6. Termination Right. From and after the date of this Amendment, Tenant shall have the right to terminate the Lease pursuant to the terms of Paragraph 12(b) of Part B of the Lease, except as follows: (a) If Tenant exercises its termination right after the execution of this Amendment but before September 1, 2010, the termination fee payable by Tenant shall be equal to the sum of (i) the amount payable by Tenant pursuant to Paragraph 12(b) of Part B of the Lease, and (ii) the amount of the fees and commissions paid to Tenant's Agent and Landlord's Agent pursuant to this Amendment, and the costs and expenses incurred by Landlord in designing and constructing the tenant improvements to the Substitute Premises pursuant to this Amendment.

In addition, Landlord shall supply and install in the Premises the workstations previously toured by Tenant. Such workstations shall be installed substantially as shown on the Space Plan. Except for the installation of the new energy efficient lights, the Tenant Improvements will be substantially complete prior to the Relocation Date.

Landlord will correct defective items stated in the punchlist which are the responsibility of Landlord or its contractor. If Tenant does not so provide Landlord with a punchlist prior to occupying the Substitute Premises, Tenant shall be deemed to have accepted the Substitute Premises and the Tenant Improvements in their then present condition, except for latent defects not reasonably discoverable upon an inspection. The existence of punchlist items shall not postpone the Relocation Date or result in a delay or abatement of Tenant's obligation to pay rent or give rise to a damage claim against Landlord. Landlord agrees to complete all punchlist items which are the responsibility of Landlord or its contractor within thirty (30) days after receiving the final punchlist (or longer if reasonably necessary). 8.
