 WHEREAS, at the time the 1961 Agreement was signed, the CITY was responsible for the payment of bonds that were outstanding for acquisition and construction of the facilities, preventing the CITY from conveying facilities until the bonds were paid; and

 WHEREAS, the 1961 Agreement provided that "The city shall continue to own the facilities described in this Section 9 and shall continue to pay the principal of and interest on any bonds issued to pay in whole or in part the cost of acquisition and construction of such facilities, provided that facilities which are designated as "permanent" shall be conveyed by the City to Metro by quit claim deed upon payment of all presently outstanding revenue bonds or general obligation bonds of the City secured by or issued to acquire or construct said facilities"; and

 WHEREAS, the CITY has paid the entire principal and interest of all such bonds issued to pay in whole or in part the cost of acquisition and construction of such facilities, and the bonds are no longer in existence; and

 WHEREAS, in 1994 Metro merged with the COUNTY; and

 WHEREAS, a number of the facilities cross CITY land under the jurisdiction or management and control of the Seattle Department of Parks and Recreation; and

 WHEREAS, the CITY and the COUNTY have agreed to record a separate easement agreement for each park, park boulevard, park overlook or other property under the jurisdiction or management and control of the Seattle Department of Parks and Recreation that is affected by the 1961 Agreement; and

 WHEREAS, the CITY and the COUNTY recognize the need to protect park land and public use of and access to CITY park land while making it possible for the COUNTY to maintain, repair and reconstruct the sewer infrastructure that serves both the CITY and the COUNTY; and

 WHEREAS, the park land affected by this Easement Agreement is hereafter referred to as "Park Land";

 NOW, THEREFORE, the CITY and the COUNTY hereby agree as follows:

 AGREEMENT

 1. Grant and Purpose. The CITY hereby grants to the COUNTY, subject to the conditions contained in this Easement Agreement, an easement (Easement) in, upon and under the real property described on Exhibit "A", attached hereto and incorporated herein by this reference (Easement Area), together with reasonable pedestrian access or vehicular access across surfaces capable of supporting the weight of the vehicles, so as not to damage the "Park Land", to reach the Easement Area.

 The purpose of the Easement is for installing, constructing, operating, maintaining, removing, repairing and replacing a wastewater pipeline below the surface of the Easement Area, together with the following listed improvements at or below the surface of the Easement Area, and for no other purposes: maintenance holes, vaults, meters, cathodic devices, electrical poles and drops, "goosenecks" and other small unobtrusive odor control devices, telemetry devices and poles, monitoring equipment, portable sampling device(s) and below grade carbon beds. All of the COUNTY's permitted improvements now or hereafter located in the Easement Area are referred to as Easement Improvements.

 2. Limitations. The COUNTY shall keep the Easement Improvements in good condition and repair at all times at the COUNTY's sole cost. Except in case of emergency or request by the CITY, the COUNTY shall provide ten (10) business days prior written notification to the CITY before undertaking any work in the Easement Area involving digging, trenching, removal of Park improvements, pruning or removal of vegetation. For purposes of this Easement pruning or removal of vegetation that has overgrown or blocked surface Easement Improvements does not require prior notice to the CITY.

 The COUNTY shall obtain a permit or other license or form of permission from the Superintendent of Parks and Recreation or duly authorized official and pay such fees or other charges as may be applicable or negotiated prior to any use or occupation of the "Park Land" outside of the Easement Area, except temporary parking for one to three maintenance vehicles in the "Park Land" parking lot (if applicable).

 All activities of the COUNTY under this Easement Agreement shall be completed without delay by COUNTY employees or by a qualified, licensed and bonded contractor, at the sole expense of the COUNTY and, upon completion of such permitted activity, the COUNTY shall immediately remove all equipment and debris and restore all disturbed topography, vegetation, landscape features and improvements, to their condition immediately prior to the initiation of such activity, unless otherwise mutually agreed in writing.

 3. CITY's Rights. The CITY shall have the continuing right to use the Easement Area, so long as such use does not interfere with the easement rights of the COUNTY and does not obstruct or endanger the usefulness of any Easement Improvements now or hereafter maintained by the COUNTY in the Easement Area. Except in case of emergency, prior to any construction in the Easement Area and prior to any activity by the CITY that requires use of the subsurface of the Easement Area the CITY shall notify the COUNTY in writing and shall provide the COUNTY with a copy of all plans and specifications for such proposed construction activity for review at least thirty (30) days prior to the commencement of such construction. Except in case of emergency, the CITY shall not commence such construction or activity unless and until it has received the COUNTY's prior written consent that the CITY's proposed construction or activity will not interfere with the COUNTY's rights under this Easement Agreement. The County's review and, if applicable, approval of the CITY's plans and specifications shall be strictly limited to the facilities and/or excavation shown on the plans and specifications submitted to the COUNTY and shall in no event constitute or be construed as a certification of the adequacy or sufficiency of the CITY's plans and specifications nor whether the CITY's construction or activity complies with other applicable laws, building codes and other governmental rules and regulations. For purposes of this Easement Agreement, landscaping activities in the Easement Area that do not obstruct or endanger the usefulness of Easement Improvements and that do not disturb that portion of the subsurface within five (5) feet from the wastewater pipeline do not require notice to and approval by the COUNTY.

 Except as otherwise provided herein, and after the date of this Easement Agreement, the construction, installation, or maintenance of any structures, whether temporary or permanent, shall be absolutely prohibited within the Easement Area and shall be deemed an unreasonable interference with the COUNTY's easement rights unless specifically approved in writing by the COUNTY as provided above, which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld. For purposes of this Easement Agreement, signs, trails, and temporary protections for new or sensitive vegetation installed by or with the permission of the CITY are permitted.

 4. Compliance with Laws; Indemnity. The COUNTY shall at all times exercise its rights under this Easement Agreement in accordance with the requirements of all applicable statutes, orders, rules and regulations of any public authority having jurisdiction. The COUNTY shall indemnify, defend, at the option of the CITY, and hold harmless the CITY, its successors and assigns, from any and all claims, damage, costs (including attorneys' fees) and liability arising in any way from acts or omissions, whether negligent or intentional, of the COUNTY, or its agents, employees or contractors, in connection with this Easement Agreement, the Easement, the Easement Area, the "Park Land" or the Easement Improvements. The COUNTY's obligations under this paragraph do not include claims, damage or liability to the extent caused by the CITY's negligence.

 5. Costs. If the COUNTY violates the terms of this Easement Agreement, requiring action by the CITY, the COUNTY shall reimburse the CITY for its reasonable costs for "Park Land" restoration, vegetation, replanting, trail or other improvement reconstruction or for repair of Easement Improvements. The COUNTY shall reimburse the CITY within forty-five (45) days of the CITY providing adequate documentation of such costs to the COUNTY. In addition, if the COUNTY fails to obtain permits required under this Easement Agreement, the CITY shall be entitled, in addition to other remedies, to recover from the COUNTY all applicable fees for the COUNTY's use of the "Park Land".

 6. Notices. Any notices required or permitted under this Easement Agreement shall be personally delivered or sent by certified mail, return receipt requested and shall be deemed given three (3) days following the date when mailed or one (1) business day following personal delivery.
