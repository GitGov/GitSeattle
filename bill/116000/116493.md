 WHEREAS, when the PC-1 North Lot is redeveloped, the City intends that the best possible redevelopment plan be pursued, and the City recognizes that the location of the cooling equipment in the easement area of the PC-1 North Lot may turn out not to be an ideal location for such equipment; and

 WHEREAS, the City seeks to ensure that the Market PDA, as it participates in redevelopment of the PC-1 North Lot, does not let the redevelopment design be constrained by the existence of this easement or the location of the cooling equipment on the PC-1 North Lot;

 NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the above and foregoing recitals, the mutual promises and covenants herein contained, and for other good and valuable consideration, the parties hereto agree as follows:

 1. Purpose: This Agreement is for the City to grant an exclusive easement for central cooling equipment purposes to the Market PDA over, under, through, across and upon a portion of the property known as PC-1 North Lot in Seattle.

 2. Conditions and Provisions: This Agreement is pursuant to the following conditions and provisions:

 * The easement under this Agreement shall be for installation of cooling equipment to serve the Pike Place Market, as managed by the Market PDA, with necessary appurtenances over, under, through, across and upon a portion of the City owned property known as PC-1 North Lot in Seattle.

 * The easement area shall be approximately 1,500 sq. ft. (25' x 60') and shall include only such rights in the property under easement as shall be necessary for the construction, reconstruction, alteration, operation, maintenance and repair of said cooling equipment.

 * The cooling equipment in the easement area shall be sited so that the top of the equipment is below the level of the top parking deck.

 * The cooling equipment in the easement area shall be sited and screened to minimize negative impacts on the Heritage House at the Market assisted living facility and on pedestrians using the pathway and stairs that link the Pike Place Market with the waterfront, to make the coolers as unobtrusive as practical, and to make the area attractive to passers-by. Design treatments might include fencing, wall finishes, landscaping, lighting, public art, and/or other elements. The Market Historical Commission may impose conditions on final design that it believes will help achieve these design goals.

 * The Market PDA, at its sole cost and expense, shall be responsible for all maintenance, repair and security of easement area.

 * The Market PDA, at its sole cost and expense, shall be responsible for installation and maintenance of all utilities located in the easement area.

 * The City shall have the right to enter onto the easement area for any City purpose at any time, provided the City's site entry and use shall not materially interfere with the Market PDA's use of the easement area.

 3. Existing Easements and Agreements: The City and Market PDA acknowledge and agree to comply with an existing 16-foot easement and covenant, granted by City Ordinance #114210, and an existing Parking Lot Management Agreement, authorized by City Ordinance #122562.

 Subject to City Fleets and Facilities Department Director approval, the Market PDA may install cooling equipment within the easement area. The Market PDA shall provide the City Fleets and Facilities Department Director in advance with detailed plans and specifications for any such improvements.

 5. Permits: The City makes no representation regarding the fitness of the easement area for Market PDA purposes. The Market PDA certifies that it has reviewed its property improvement proposals pertaining to the easement area, including the existing 16-foot easement and covenant described in Section 3 of this Agreement, with the City Department of Planning and Development and that contemplated improvements are compatible and in compliance with existing property and use restrictions.

 8. Term of Agreement: This Agreement shall become effective when executed by both parties. This Agreement shall survive the filing of the easement and shall remain in effect unless terminated under the terms of this Agreement. The Parties hereby agree that the easement may be extinguished upon the happening of any one or more of the following:
