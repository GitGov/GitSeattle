 ORDINANCE _________________

 AN ORDINANCE related to the City's computer software; removing a budget proviso that restricts an appropriation in the 2008 Adopted Budget for the Department of Information Technology's Technology and Governance Budget Control Level; and authorizing expenditure of the appropriation for Microsoft Office 2007 licenses under an enterprise agreement and for planning an upgrade of the City's computer software to Microsoft Office 2007.

 WHEREAS, for many years, Microsoft Office ("MS Office") has been the City's standard for word processing, spreadsheets, and other end-user functions, and Novell GroupWise has been the City's standard for e- mail and calendaring; and

 WHEREAS, the Department of Information Technology (DoIT) is pursuing an overall strategy (referred to as the "Technology Infrastructure Optimization" or "TIO" project) to move the City towards an integrated software platform based on Microsoft products and has received Council authorization to move forward with initial planning under Ordinance 122500; and

 WHEREAS, the TIO project has three phases of work including: 1) migrating the City's e-mail system from Novell GroupWise to Microsoft Exchange/Outlook; 2) upgrading the current version of MS Office; and 3) converting the currently mixed file/print system to a standard Microsoft Windows platform; and

 WHEREAS, the 2008 Adopted Budget provides $2,752,768 in DoIT's Technology and Governance Budget Control Level for DoIT to purchase MS Office 2007 for all departments except Seattle City Light, Seattle Public Utilities, and Seattle Public Library (which either have purchased or will purchase the licenses separately); and

 WHEREAS, in adopting the 2008 budget, the City Council passed Green Sheet 90-1-A-1, which includes a budget proviso restricting the expenditure of the $2,752,768 appropriation in DoIT's 2008 Adopted Budget for upgrading software for City departments to MS Office 2007; and

 WHEREAS, the City Council stated its intention to lift the proviso provided that the City Council has reviewed the detailed implementation plan and cost estimate for the part of TIO involving e-mail migration; and

 WHEREAS, during development of the detailed implementation plan and cost estimate for the first phase of TIO, DoIT determined that purchasing MS Office 2007 licenses under an enterprise agreement and beginning to plan for an upgrade of the City's computer software to MS Office 2007 would best serve the City's technological and financial interests; and

 WHEREAS, DoIT has provided the Council with a detailed implementation plan and cost estimate for the first phase of the TIO project described above, thereby satisfying the requirements set forth in the Council's 2008 budget proviso; NOW, THEREFORE,
