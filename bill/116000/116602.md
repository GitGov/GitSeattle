 ;and

 WHEREAS, in consideration of the State's contribution of funds used by the City to acquire the Property and the State's assumption of the operation of the WTBBL on July 1, 2008, the City and the State desire to transfer the ownership of Floors 1 and 2 of the Building from the City to the State; and

 WHEREAS, the City and State have agreed to basic terms and conditions under which the parties will complete the conversion of the Property to the condominium and by which the City will convey two units in the condominium to the State; NOW, THEREFORE,

 BE IT ORDAINED BY THE CITY OF SEATTLE AS FOLLOWS:

 Section 1. The Director of the Fleets and Facilities Department or designee is hereby authorized, for and on behalf of the City of Seattle, to execute, deliver, perform, administer and enforce a Condominium Creation and Conveyance Agreement substantially in the form of Attachment 1 hereto (the "Agreement") for the creation of a nonresidential condominium on the Property legally described on Exhibit A to Attachment 1 (the "Condominium").

 Section 2. Conditioned upon execution of the Agreement described in Section 1, the Director of the Fleets and Facilities Department or designee is authorized to record a Condominium Declaration, substantially in the form of Attachment 2 hereto, and a survey map and plans, substantially in the form of Attachment 3 hereto, which documents will establish four nonresidential Condominium units on the Property. In addition, the Director of the Fleets and Facilities Department or designee is authorized to prepare bylaws and rules and regulations for the operation of the Condominium that are consistent with the Condominium Declaration, and is further authorized to execute and record a Right of First Offer Agreement in the form of Attachment 4 hereto, which will give the State or the City, as the case may be, the first right to purchase any Condominium unit that either party wishes to sell.

 Section 3. Upon the recording of the Condominium Declaration and survey map and plans, the Director of the Fleets and Facilities Department or designee is hereby authorized, for and on behalf of the City, to convey the Floor 1 Unit and Floor 2 Unit to the State of Washington by Bargain and Sale Deed substantially in the form of Attachment 5 hereto.

 Section 4. Vehicle access to and from the Basement Unit and Floor 3 Unit is available only by way of an access ramp and tunnel, respectively, both of which are located on the adjacent City-owned West Police Precinct property. To facilitate continued access to and from these Units, temporary easements will be created over the West Police Precinct property, benefitting the Basement and Floor 3 Units and the Condominium association. The Director of the Fleets and Facilities Department or designee is authorized, for and on behalf of the City, to execute and record a declaration of such temporary easements, substantially in the form of Attachment 6 hereto.

 Section 5. The Director of the Fleets and Facilities Department or designee is further authorized and directed, for and on behalf of the City, to make technical, conforming or otherwise nonmaterial changes to the Agreement; and to execute, deliver, record, administer and perform such ancillary agreements or documents or to take such other actions as in their judgment may be necessary, appropriate or desirable in order to carry out the terms and provisions of, and complete the transactions contemplated by, this ordinance.

 Section 6. Because the four Condominium units will share various common spaces, facilities and structures (the "Common Elements"), it is desirable and efficient that certain services be provided uniformly throughout the Condominium. The Condominium Association as a whole will be responsible to facilitate such services. Therefore, the provisions of Title 20 of the Seattle Municipal Code (relating to Public Works, Improvements and Purchasing) shall not apply to the purchase of products or services by the Condominium Association for the operation, maintenance, repair and replacement of the Common Elements. The City's operation, maintenance, repair and replacement of the City's Condominium Units and the City's limited common elements, however, shall comply with all provisions of the Municipal Code, including Title 20.

 Section 7. The City's Excess Property Disposition Policies adopted by Resolution 29799 and amended by Resolution 30862 shall not apply to this transaction.

 Section 8. This ordinance shall take effect and be in force thirty (30) days from and after its approval by the Mayor, but if not approved and returned by the Mayor within ten (10) days after presentation, it shall take effect as provided by Municipal Code Section 1.04.020.

The 2008 MOU described a "Project Agreement" to be made by the City and the State. This Agreement is intended to be the "Project Agreement" described in the 2008 MOU.

 I. This Agreement is made to set forth the terms and conditions under which the parties will complete the conversion of the Property to the Condominium and by which the City will convey one or more units in the Condominium to the State.

The Condominium shall comprise four (4) Condominium units: the Basement Unit, Floor 1 Unit, Floor 2 Unit, and Floor 3 Unit (collectively, the "Units"), all as depicted generally on the Drawings attached hereto as Exhibit B. The exact boundaries of the Units and Common Elements shall be established by the Condominium survey map and plans and declaration approved by the parties as described hereinbelow.

 (E) Recommendations regarding the means by which all utility services may be separately metered to each Unit.

 b. Cooperation of Parties. The City shall cooperate with and involve the State in the supervision of the Architect/Engineer.

 ENTRY FOR REPAIRS

 The Association and its agents or employees may enter any Unit and the Limited Common Elements adjacent or allocated thereto to effect repairs, improvements, replacements, or maintenance deemed by the Board to be necessary in the performance of its duties, to do necessary work that the Unit Owner has failed to perform, or to prevent damage to the Common Elements or to another Unit. Except in cases of great emergency that preclude advance notice, the Board shall cause the Unit occupant to be given notice and an explanation of the need for entry as far in advance of entry as is reasonably practicable. Such entry shall be made with as little inconvenience to the Owners and occupants as practicable. Any damage caused by such entry shall be repaired by the Association as a common expense unless the repairs or maintenance were necessitated by the acts or default of the Owner or occupant of the Unit entered, in which event the costs of the repairs or maintenance shall be specially assessed to that Unit. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if any Unit is owned by the City of Seattle, then the Association and its agents or employees shall comply with all requirements of the City of Seattle regarding background checks and other security precautions before entering any such Unit or Limited Common Elements adjacent or allocated thereto.

 ARTICLE 13

 ASSOCIATION OF UNIT OWNERS

 Section 13.1 Form of Association

 Section 13.3 Transfer of Membership

 . The Association membership of each Owner (including Declarant) shall be appurtenant to the Unit giving rise to such membership, and shall not be transferred in any way except upon the transfer of the Owner's interest in the Unit and then only to the transferee. Any attempt to make a prohibited transfer shall be void. Any transfer of an Owner's interest in a Unit shall operate automatically to transfer the membership in the Association to the new Owner.

 Section 13.4 Voting

 . The voting power of the Owner of each Unit shall be equal to the Allocated Interest of the Unit as set forth on Exhibit B. An Owner (including Declarant) of more than one Unit shall have the votes appertaining to all Units owned. No votes allocated to a Unit owned by the Association may be cast, and in determining the percentage of votes required to act on any matter, the votes allocated to the Association shall be disregarded. No lessee of any Unit shall have the right to use the voting power of the Owner of such Unit, unless such lessee has been designated as the voting representative of such Unit by the Owner pursuant to Section 13.5 below.

 Section 13.5 Voting Representative

 . An Owner may, by written notice to the Board, designate a voting representative for its Unit. The voting representative need not be an Owner. The designation may be revoked at any time by written notice to the Board from the Owner or by actual notice to the Board of the death or judicially declared incompetence of the Owner, except in cases in which the person designated is a Mortgagee of the Unit. This power of designation and revocation may be exercised by the guardian of an Owner, the attorney-in-fact for the Owner under a durable power of attorney, and the administrators or executors of an Owner's estate. If no designation has been made among multiple Owners of a Unit, or if a designation has been revoked and no new designation has been made, all votes allocated to each Unit may be cast by the one of multiple Owners present at the meeting, or if more than one of multiple Owners are present, according to the agreement of a majority in interest of such Owners in the Unit.

 Section 13.6 Joint Owner Disputes

 . The voting interest of each Unit must be cast as a single vote. Fractional votes shall not be allowed. If joint Owners are unable to agree how their vote shall be cast, they shall lose their right to vote on the matter in question.

 Section 13.7 Pledged Votes

 . If an Owner is in default under a First Mortgage on its Unit for sixty (60) consecutive days or more, the Mortgagee shall automatically be authorized to declare at any time thereafter that the Owner has pledged its vote on all issues to the Mortgagee during the continuance of the default. If the Board has been notified of any such pledge to a Mortgagee, and if the pledge is then effective, only the vote of the Mortgagee will be recognized on the issues that are subject to the pledge.

 Section 13.8 Annual and Special Meetings

 . There shall be an annual meeting of the members of the Association in the second quarter of each fiscal year at such reasonable place and time as may be designated by no less than ten (10) or more than sixty (60) days written notice from the Board. Special meetings of the Association may be called at any time by the president, a majority of the Board or Owners having twenty percent (20%) of the votes in the Association, for the purpose of considering matters which require the approval of all or some of the Owners, or for any other reasonable purpose. Any Institutional Holder of a First Mortgage may attend or designate a representative to attend the meetings of the Association.

 Section 13.10 Audits

 . At the annual meeting, there shall be presented an audited financial statement of the Association, prepared by a certified or licensed public accountant who is not a member of the Board or an Owner. The above-described audit may be waived annually by the unanimous vote of all Owners. If the above-described audit is waived, any holder of a Mortgage may cause an audited financial statement of the Condominium to be prepared at such holder's expense and the Association shall cooperate fully with any such audit. The Board, or persons having thirty-five percent (35%) or more of the voting power of the Association, may require that an audit of the Association and management books be presented at any special meeting. An Owner, at its expense, may at any reasonable time conduct an audit of the books of the Board and the Association.

 Section 13.11 Articles and Bylaws

 . The Association will adopt Bylaws to supplement this Declaration and the Articles and to provide for the administration of the Association and the Property and for other purposes not inconsistent with the Condominium Statute or this Declaration. The Articles and Bylaws may be amended as provided therein and consistent with applicable law. However, no material amendment of the Articles or Bylaws may be made without the prior written approval of fifty-one percent (51%) of the Eligible Mortgagees.

If delivery is made by mail, the notice shall be deemed to have been delivered on the third (3rd) day of regular mail delivery after it has been deposited in the United States mail, first class, postage prepaid, addressed to the person entitled to such notice at the most recent address known to the Board. Notice to the Owner of any Unit shall be sufficient if mailed to the Unit if no other mailing address has been given to the Board. Mailing addresses may be changed by notice in writing to the Board. Notices to the Board shall be given to the president or secretary of the Association.

 Section 14.2 Eligible Mortgagees

 . Until such time as any Eligible Mortgagee withdraws its request for notice or satisfies the Mortgage held, guaranteed or insured by such Eligible Mortgagee of record, the Board shall send to the Eligible Mortgagee a copy of all notices of any proposed actions which require the consent of a specified percentage of Eligible Mortgagees. All Institutional Holders of First Mortgages shall be entitled to notices under Article 22 (damage and repair of damage to property) and Article 23 (condemnation) irrespective of whether they have filed requests for notices.

The Board may hire such full-time or part- time employees as it considers necessary.

 Section 15.4 Managing Agent

 . The Board may, but shall not be required to, contract with an experienced professional Managing Agent to assist the Board in the management and operation of the Condominium and may delegate such of its powers and duties to the Managing Agent as it deems to be appropriate, except as limited herein. Only the Board can approve an annual budget or a supplemental budget, and only the Board can impose a special assessment on a Unit or authorize foreclosure of an assessment lien. Any contract with a Managing Agent, or any other contract providing for management or operational services, shall have a term no longer than one (1) year (but may be renewable by agreement of the parties for successive one- (1) year periods) and shall be terminable by the Board without payment of a termination fee, with or without cause, on thirty (30) days' written notice.

 Section 15.5 Protection of Property

The Board may impose and collect reasonable charges for the preparation and recording of amendments to the Declaration and statements of unpaid assessments, and may assign its right to future income, including the right to receive common expense assessments. The Board may impose and collect any payments, fees or charges for the use, rental or operation of the Common Elements other than Limited Common Elements appurtenant to each Unit, and for services provided to Owners. Upon ninety (90) days' notice, the Board may terminate without penalty any management contract, employment contract, or any other contract or lease between the Association and Declarant or an affiliate of Declarant, or any contract or lease that is not bona fide or was unconscionable to the Owners at the time entered into under the circumstances then prevailing, if such contract or lease was entered into before the Board appointed or elected by the Owners took office.

 ARTICLE 16

 BUDGET AND ASSESSMENT FOR COMMON EXPENSES

 Section 16.1 Preparation of Budget

 . At least ninety (90) days prior to the beginning of each calendar year, the Board shall estimate the charges (including common expenses, and any special charges for particular Units) to be paid during such year and prepare a budget for creating, funding and maintaining reasonable repair, replacement and acquisition of Common Elements, taking into account any expected income and any surplus available from the prior year's operating fund (which surplus may be applied by the Association to current operating expenses as referenced in the budget). Within thirty (30) days after adoption of any proposed budget for the Condominium, the Board shall provide a summary thereof to all Owners and set a date which is not less than fourteen (14) nor more than sixty (60) days after mailing of the summary for a meeting of the Owners to consider ratification of the budget. The budget shall be ratified unless at such meeting any Owner rejects the budget, whether or not a quorum is present. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing but in furtherance thereof, the Board may create and maintain from regular periodic assessments a reserve fund for periodic maintenance and repair of Common Elements and for replacement of those Common Elements which can reasonably be expected to require replacement prior to the end of the useful life of the Building. If the Board creates and maintains a maintenance reserve fund, then the Board is encouraged to make reasonable efforts to ensure that reserves are fully adequate to cover all reasonably foreseeable replacement costs, including hiring independent consultants to evaluate the useful life of each component of the Common Elements, should such efforts be requested by any Owner. If the sum estimated and budgeted at any time proves inadequate for any reason (including nonpayment of any Owner's assessment), the Board may prepare a supplemental budget, which shall be subject to Owner ratification as described above.

 Section 16.2 Periodic Assessments for Common Expenses and Accrual of Assessments

 . The sums required by the Association for common expenses as reflected by the budget and any supplemental budgets shall be divided into equal installments to be paid each month over the period of time covered by the budget or supplemental budget, provided, however, that any Owner that is a governmental entity, including without limitation the City of Seattle or any department or office of the State of Washington, shall have the option to pay its annual assessment once each fiscal year without penalty at any time during the first six (6) months of the Association's fiscal year. The regular assessments shall be assessed to all of the Units and their respective Owners in proportion to the Units' Allocated Interests in the Common Elements, initially as described in Exhibit B. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the budget may include expenses related to Limited Common Elements which may be assessed against the Units to which such Limited Common Elements appertain equally and/or expenses benefiting certain Units may be assessed exclusively against those Units. The cost of utilities shall be assessed in proportion to usage as described in Section 11.4 above. Assessments to pay a judgment against the Association perfected under RCW 4.64.020 may be made only against Units in the Condominium at the time the judgment was entered in proportion to their Allocated Interests in common expense liability at the time the judgment was entered. Any common expenses caused by the misconduct of an Owner may be assessed exclusively against such Owner's Unit. Until the Association makes a common expense assessment, the Declarant shall pay all common expenses. The first assessment shall be made by the Association against all Units, no later than sixty (60) days after the first Unit is conveyed. Thereafter, assessments shall be made against all Units, based on a budget adopted by the Association.

 Section 16.3 Revised Assessments

 . The assessments shall be based upon the Allocated Interests stated in Exhibit B as amended except as expressly provided otherwise in this Declaration.

 Section 16.4 Special Assessments

 . The Board may levy special assessments for those Common Expenses that were not anticipated at the time any budget or supplemental budget was ratified by the Owners. If a special assessment becomes chargeable against a Unit under the authority of this Declaration or the Bylaws, the Board shall determine the amount of such special assessment and fix the schedule upon which it is to be paid, provided, however, that any Owner that is a governmental entity shall have the option to pay all special assessments due during any fiscal year in a single payment without penalty at any time within six (6) months after the initial payment of the special assessment is due during such fiscal year. The special assessment shall be added to the Unit's regular assessment of common expenses and be included in the assessment against the Unit.

 Section 16.5 Notice of Assessment

 . The Board shall notify each Owner in writing of the amount of the assessments to be paid for such Owner's Unit and shall furnish copies of each budget on which the assessments are based to all Owners and, if so requested, to their respective Mortgagees.

 Section 16.6 Payment of Assessments

 . On or before the first day of each calendar month each Owner shall pay or cause to be paid to the treasurer or Managing Agent of the Association the assessment against the Unit for that month, except as otherwise permitted in Section 16.2 as to any Owner that is a governmental entity. Any assessment not paid when due shall be delinquent and subject to late charges, interest charges and collection procedures as provided in Article 17.

 Section 16.7 Proceeds Belong to Association

 . All assessments and other receipts received by the Association on behalf of the Condominium shall belong to the Association.

 Section 16.8 Failure to Assess

 . Any failure by the Board or the Association to make the budget and assessments hereunder before the expiration of any budget period for the ensuing period shall not be deemed a waiver or modification in any respect of the provisions of this Declaration, or a release of the Owners from the obligation to pay assessments during that or any subsequent time period, and the assessments and amounts previously established shall continue until a new assessment is established.

 Section 16.9 Certificate of Unpaid Assessments

 . Upon the request of any Owner, Mortgagee, prospective purchaser, or prospective Mortgagee of a Unit, the Board shall furnish within fifteen (15) days after request therefor a certificate in recordable form stating the amount, if any, of unpaid assessments charged to the Unit. The certificate shall be binding upon the Board, the Association and every Owner as to the amount of such indebtedness on the date of the certificate unless and to the extent known by the recipient to be false.

 Section 16.10 Separate Accounts

 . If the Association maintains reserve accounts, then the Board shall require that the Association maintain separate accounts for current operations, maintenance reserves, and insurance reserves. No funds of the Association shall be commingled with the funds of any other association or with the funds of the Managing Agent or any other person responsible for the custody of such funds. Any action affecting reserve funds, including issuance of checks, shall require the signature of at least two (2) persons who are officers or directors of the Association. All such assessments and charges shall be collected and held in trust for, and administered and expended for the benefit of, the Owners.

 ARTICLE 17

 LIEN AND COLLECTION OF ASSESSMENTS

 Section 17.1 Assessments Are a Lien; Priority

 . All unpaid sums assessed by the Association for the share of the common expenses chargeable to any Unit and any sums specially assessed to any Unit under the authority of this Declaration or the Bylaws (together with interest, fines, late charges, costs, and attorneys' fees in the event of delinquency) shall constitute a continuing lien on the Unit and all its appurtenances from the time the assessment is due. The lien for such unpaid assessments shall be prior to all other liens and encumbrances except (a) liens and encumbrances recorded before the recording of the Declaration, (b) a Mortgage on the Unit recorded before the date on which the assessment sought to be enforced became delinquent, and (c) liens for real property taxes and other governmental assessments or charges against the Unit. Except as provided above (and subject to the provisions of Section 17.2 below), a Mortgagee that obtains the right of possession of a Unit through a foreclosure or deed of trust sale, or by taking a deed in lieu of foreclosure or sale, or a purchaser at a foreclosure sale, shall take the Unit free of any claims for assessments or installments thereof that became due prior to such right of possession, but will be liable for the common expenses and assessments that become due thereafter. The Unit's past due share of common expenses or assessments shall become new common expenses chargeable to all of the Owners, including the Mortgagee or foreclosure sale purchaser and their successors and assigns, in proportion to their respective Allocated Interests in the Common Elements; however, the Owner shall continue to be personally liable for such past accrued assessments, as provided in Section 17.3. For the purpose of this Section, the terms "Mortgage" and "Mortgagee" shall not mean any real estate contract or vendor or designee or assignee of a vendor under a real estate contract.

 Section 17.2 Judicial Foreclosure

 . The lien arising under Section 17.1 may be foreclosed judicially by the Association or its authorized representative in the manner set forth in RCW Chapter 61.12. The Association or its authorized representative shall have the power to purchase the Unit at the foreclosure sale and to acquire, hold, lease, mortgage, or convey the same. Upon an express waiver in the complaint of any right to a deficiency judgment in a judicial foreclosure action, the period of redemption shall be eight (8) months. Nothing in this section shall prohibit the Association from taking a deed in lieu of foreclosure.

 Section 17.3 Nonjudicial Foreclosure

 . A lien arising under Section 17.1 may be foreclosed nonjudicially in the manner set forth in RCW Chapter 61.24 for the nonjudicial foreclosure of deeds of trust. Each Unit Owner ("Grantor") by its acceptance of title to its Unit does grant its Unit in trust to Chicago Title Insurance Company ("Trustee") to secure the obligations of such Unit Owner ("Grantor") to the Association ("Beneficiary") for the payment of assessments. Each Grantor shall retain the right to possession of Grantor's Unit so long as Grantor is not in default of any obligation to pay assessments. The Trustee shall have a power of sale with respect to each Unit, which becomes operative in the case of a default in a Grantor's obligation to pay assessments. The Units are not used principally for agricultural or farming purposes.

 Section 17.4 Assessments Are Personal Obligations

 . In addition to constituting a lien on the Unit and all its appurtenances, all sums assessed by the Association chargeable to any Unit (together with interest, costs and attorneys' fees in the event of delinquency) shall be the joint and several personal obligations of the Unit Owner when the assessment is made and such Owner's successors in title who assume such obligations, for all assessments due up to the time of each Owner's conveyance of the Unit, without prejudice to any such successor's ability to recover from the Owner the amounts paid by such successor therefore, provided, however, that if an Owner is a corporate or governmental entity then these obligations shall not be the personal obligations of the individuals who may be affiliated with such entity unless they expressly personally assume such obligations. Suit to recover a personal judgment for any delinquent assessments shall be maintainable without foreclosing or waiving the lien securing them.

 Section 17.5 Receiver

 . From the later of (a) commencement of an action by the Association to foreclose a lien for delinquent assessment(s) against a Unit that is not occupied by its Owner or (b) delinquency of the assessment(s), the Association may appoint a receiver to collect from any lessee of the Unit the rent for the Unit as and when due. If the rental is not paid, the receiver may obtain possession of the Unit, refurbish it for rental up to a reasonable standard for rental units in this type of condominium, rent the Unit or permit its rental to others and apply the rents first to the cost of the receivership and attorneys' fees thereof, then to the cost of refurbishing the Unit, then to applicable charges, then to costs, fees and charges of the foreclosure action, and then to the payment of the delinquent assessments. Exercise by the Association of the foregoing rights shall not effect the priority of any preexisting liens on the Unit.

 Section 17.6 Late Charges and Interest on Delinquent Assessments

 . The Board may from time to time establish reasonable late charges and a rate of interest to be charged on assessments that may thereafter become delinquent. In the absence of another established nonusurious rate, delinquent assessments shall bear interest at the rate of twelve percent (12%) per annum.

 Section 17.7 Recovery of Attorneys' Fees and Costs

 . In any action to collect delinquent assessments, including appeal thereof and enforcement of a judgment, the prevailing party shall be entitled to recover as a part of its judgment a reasonable sum for attorneys' fees and expenses reasonably incurred in connection with the action, in addition to taxable costs permitted by law, provided, however, that the foregoing provision shall not apply if all Units are owned by governmental entities.

 Section 17.8 Remedies Cumulative

 . The remedies provided herein are cumulative and the Board may pursue them, and any other remedies which may be available under the law although not expressed herein, either concurrently or in any order.

 Section 17.9 Security Deposit

 . An Owner who has been delinquent in paying its assessments for seven (7) of the twelve (12) preceding months may be required by the Board, from time to time, to make and maintain a security deposit not in excess of three (3) months' estimated monthly assessments, which shall be collected and shall be subject to penalties for nonpayment as are other assessments. The deposit shall be held by the Association in a separate fund, credited to such Owner, and may be resorted to by the Association at any time when such Owner is ten (10) days or more delinquent in paying its assessments.

 Section 17.10 No Lien on City or State Property

 . Notwithstanding any other provision of this Declaration to the contrary, if any Unit is owned or leased by the City of Seattle, any department or office of the State of Washington, or other governmental entity within the meaning of RCW 6.17.080, as it may be amended from time to time, no lien created by this Declaration shall attach to such Unit, provided that this Section 17.10 shall not affect the liability of such governmental entity for the payment of any assessments due hereunder, which shall, as provided in Section 17.3, be the personal obligation of the governmental entity.

 ARTICLE 18

 COMPLIANCE WITH DECLARATION

 Section 18.1 Enforcement

 . Each Owner and the Association shall comply strictly with the provisions of this Declaration and with the Bylaws and administrative rules and regulations passed hereunder, as the same may be lawfully amended from time to time, and with all decisions adopted pursuant to this Declaration and the Bylaws and administrative rules and regulations. Failure to comply shall be grounds for an action to recover sums due for damages, or injunctive relief, or both maintainable by the Board acting through its officers on behalf of the Owners, or by any aggrieved Owner on its own.

 Section 18.2 No Waiver of Strict Performance

 . The failure of the Board (or the Managing Agent) in any instance to insist upon the strict compliance with this Declaration or the Bylaws or rules and regulations of the Association, or to exercise any right contained in such documents or to serve any notice or to institute any action, shall not be construed as a waiver or a relinquishment for the future of any term covenant, condition, or restriction. The receipt by the Board of payment of an assessment from an Owner, with knowledge of a breach by the Owner, shall not be a waiver of the breach. No waiver by the Board of any requirement shall be effective unless expressed in writing and signed for the Board.

 ARTICLE 19

 LIMITATION OF LIABILITY

 Section 19.1 Liability for Utility Failure, Etc

 . Except to the extent covered by insurance obtained by the Board, none of the Association, the Board, the Managing Agent or the Declarant shall be liable for: the failure of any utility or other service to be obtained and paid for by the Board; any injury or damage to person or property caused by the elements, or resulting from electricity, water, rain, dust, or sand which may lead or flow from outside or from any parts of the Buildings, or from any of their pipes, drains, conduits, appliances, or equipment, or from any other place; or for inconvenience or discomfort resulting from any action taken to comply with any law, ordinance, or orders of a governmental authority. No diminution or abatement of common expense assessments shall be claimed or allowed for any such utility or service failure, or for such injury or damage, or for such inconvenience or discomfort.

 Section 19.2 No Personal Liability

 . Except as otherwise provided in the Condominium Statute, so long as a Board member, Association committee member, Association officer, Declarant or the Managing Agent has acted in good faith, with ordinary and reasonable care (and in the case of Board officers and members appointed by Declarant, with the care required of a fiduciary of the Owners), without willful or intentional misconduct, upon the basis of such information as is then possessed by such person, no such person shall be personally liable to any Owner, or to any other person, including the Association, for any damage, loss, or prejudice suffered or claimed on account of any act, omission, error, or negligence of such person; provided that this section shall not apply where the consequences of such act, omission, error, or negligence is covered by insurance obtained by the Board.

 ARTICLE 20

 INDEMNIFICATION

 Each Board member, Association committee member, and Association officer shall be indemnified by the Association against all expenses and liabilities, including attorneys' fees, reasonably incurred by or imposed in connection with any proceeding to which he or she may be a party, or in which he or she may become involved, by reason of holding or having held the position of Board member, Association committee member, or Association officer, or any settlement thereof, whether or not he or she holds such position at the time such expenses or liabilities are incurred, except to the extent such expenses and liabilities are covered by any type of insurance and except in such cases wherein such person is adjudged guilty of willful misfeasance in the performance of his or her duties; provided that, in the event of a settlement, the indemnification shall apply only when the Board approves such settlement and reimbursement as being for the best interests of the Association; and further provided that nothing contained in this Article 20 shall be deemed to obligate the Association to indemnify any Owner who is or has been a Board member or officer of the Association with respect to any duties or obligations assumed or liabilities incurred by he or she under or by virtue of the Declaration as an Owner of a Unit covered thereby.

 ARTICLE 21

 INSURANCE

 Section 21.1 General Requirements

 . The Board shall cause the Association to purchase and maintain at all times as a common expense a policy or policies and bonds necessary to provide property insurance; comprehensive liability insurance; fidelity bonds; worker's compensation insurance to the extent required by applicable laws; insurance against loss of personal property of the Association by fire, theft, or other causes with such deductible provisions as the Board deems advisable; insurance, if available, for the protection of the Association's directors, officers, and representatives from personal liability in the management of the Association's affairs; and such other insurance as the Board deems advisable or is required by the Condominium Statute. The Board shall review at least annually the adequacy of the Association's insurance coverage. All insurance shall be obtained from an insurance carrier rated Triple A (and rated in Class XI or better financial condition) by Best's Insurance Reports or equivalent rating service, and licensed to do business in the State of Washington. Notwithstanding any other provisions herein, the Association shall continuously maintain in effect casualty, flood, and liability insurance and a fidelity bond that meets the insurance and fidelity bond requirements for commercial condominium projects established by any applicable law, ordinance, or regulation. All such insurance policies and fidelity bonds shall provide that coverage may not be cancelled, modified or allowed to lapse (including cancellation for nonpayment of premium) without compliance with all applicable provisions of Chapter 48.18 RCW pertaining to cancellation or nonrenewal of insurance and at least thirty (30) days' prior written notice to any and all Mortgagees, designated servicers of Mortgagees, and all insurers that issue certificates or memoranda to the Association and, upon written request, to any Owner or Mortgagee. Promptly upon the conveyance of a Unit, the new Owner shall notify the Association of the date of the conveyance and the Owner's name and address. The Association shall notify each insurance company that has issued an insurance policy to the Association for the benefit of the Owners under this Article 21 of the name and address of the new Owner and request that the new Owner be made a named insured under such policy. No claims may be made under any insurance policy held by the Association except upon the approval of the Board. If any requirement of this Article 21 may be satisfied by participating in a government-procured program of insurance, then the Association may at its option satisfy such requirement by participating in such program.

 Section 21.2 Property Insurance

 . The property insurance shall, at the minimum, consist of a standard form of fire insurance policy with extended coverage or "all risk" endorsements in an amount equal to the full replacement value (i.e., one hundred percent (100%) of current replacement cost exclusive of land, foundation, excavation, and other items normally excluded from coverage) of the Common Elements, and all fixtures and equipment belonging to the Association with an "Agreed Amount Endorsement" or its equivalent, if available, or an "Inflation Guard Endorsement." In addition to protection against loss or damage by fire and other hazards covered by the standard extended coverage endorsement, the policy shall provide protection against loss or damage from sprinkler leakage, debris removal, cost of demolition, vandalism, malicious mischief, windstorm, water damage, and such other risks as are customarily covered in policies for commercial condominium projects of similar construction and use in the greater Seattle metropolitan area. The policy or policies shall provide for separate protection for each Unit to the full insurance replacement value thereof (limited as above provided), and a separate loss payable endorsement in favor of the holder of the Mortgage that creates a lien against such Unit; provided, however, that each Owner shall obtain property insurance on the Owner's Unit on such terms as are generally consistent with the property insurance requirements of this Declaration and each Owner shall be responsible for casualty damages to its Unit up to the deductible amounts of its property insurance policy and the Association's property insurance policy. The insurance proceeds may be made payable to any trustee with which the Association may enter into an insurable trust agreement, or any successor trustee, who shall have exclusive authority to negotiate losses under the policies. The policies shall provide that, notwithstanding any provisions thereof which give the carrier the right to elect to restore damage in lieu of making a cash settlement, such option shall not be exercisable without the prior written approval of the Association (or any insurance trustee) or when in conflict with the provisions of any insurance trust agreement to which the Association may be a party, or any requirement of law. The policy or policies shall have deductibles of no greater than the lesser of Five Hundred Thousand Dollars ($500,000.00) or one percent (1%) of the coverage amount.

 Section 21.3 Comprehensive Public Liability Insurance

 . The comprehensive policy of public liability insurance shall insure the Board, the Association, the Owners, and the Managing Agent, and cover all of the Common Elements, with a "Severability of Interest Endorsement" or equivalent coverage that would preclude the insurer from denying the claim of an Owner because of the negligent acts of the Association or of another Owner, and shall include protection against water damage liability, liability for nonowned and hired automobiles, liability for property of others, and such other risks as are customarily covered with respect to commercial condominium projects of similar construction and use in the greater Seattle metropolitan area. The limits of liability shall not be less than One Million Dollars ($1,000,000) covering all claims for personal injury and/or property damage arising out of a single occurrence and Two Million Dollars ($2,000,000) general aggregate.

 Section 21.4 Additional Policy Provisions

 . The Board shall exercise its reasonable best efforts to obtain insurance policies pursuant to Sections 21.2 and 21.3 containing the following provisions and limitations:

 (a)

 The named insured shall be the Association, as trustee for each of the Owners in accordance with their respective Allocated Interests in the Common Elements. The insurance proceeds may be made payable to any trustee with which the Association may enter into an insurance trust agreement, or any successor trustee, who shall have exclusive authority to negotiate losses under the policies.

 (b)

 Such policies shall not provide for contribution by or assessment against Mortgagees or become a lien on the Property superior to the lien of a First Mortgage.

 (c)

 In no event shall the insurance coverage be brought into contribution with insurance purchased by the Owners of the Units or their Mortgagees.

 (d)

 Coverage shall not be prejudiced by (i) any act or neglect of the Owners when such act or neglect is not within the control of the Association, or (ii) failure of the Association to comply with any warranty or condition with regard to any portion of the Property over which the Association has no control.

 (e)

 A waiver of subrogation by the insurer as to any and all claims against the Association, any Owner and their respective agents, employees, household members, or tenants, and of any defenses based upon co-insurance or upon invalidity arising from the acts of the insured.

 (f)

 A standard mortgagee clause which shall provide:

 (i) that any reference to a mortgagee in the policy shall mean and include all holders of Mortgages that create liens against any Units or Unit leaseholds or subleaseholds in their respective order of preference, whether or not named therein;

 (ii) that such insurance as to the interest of any holder of a Mortgage shall not be invalidated by any act or neglect of the Board or Owners or any persons under any of them;

 (iii) any provision invalidating such mortgagee clause by reason of the failure of any holder of a Mortgage to notify the insurer of any hazardous use or vacancy, any requirement that such holder pay any premium thereon, and any contribution clause; and

 (iv) that, without affecting any protection afforded by such mortgagee clause, any proceeds payable under such policy shall be payable to the Board or the insurance trustee.

 Section 21.5 Fidelity Bonds

 . The required fidelity bonds shall afford coverage to protect against dishonest acts on the part of officers, directors, trustees, and employees of the Association or the Managing Agent and all other persons who handle or are responsible for handling funds of the Association and be in an amount equal to at least fifty-five percent (55%) of the estimated annual operating expenses of the Condominium, including reserves. All such fidelity bonds shall name the Association as an obligee and contain waivers of any defense based upon the exclusion of persons who serve without compensation from any definition of "employee" or similar expression.

 Section 21.6 Owners' Individual Insurance

 . Each Owner shall obtain additional insurance on its Unit and the contents at its own expense unless the Owner's insurance would decrease the amount that the Board, or any trustee for the Board, on behalf of all of the Owners, will realize under any insurance policy that the Board may have in force on the Property. Any Owner who obtains individual insurance policies covering any portion of the Property other than personal property belonging to such Owner shall file a copy of its individual policy or policies with the Board within thirty (30) days after such Owner buys it, and the Board shall immediately review its effect with the Board's insurance broker, agent, or carrier.

 Section 21.7 Insurance Proceeds

 . Insurance proceeds for damage or destruction to any part of the Property shall be paid to the Board on behalf of the Association which shall segregate such proceeds from any other funds of the Association for use and payment as provided for in Article 22. The Association acting through the Board shall have the authority to settle and compromise any claim under insurance obtained by the Association, each Owner hereby appoints the Association as its attorney in fact for this purpose and the insurer may accept the release and discharge of liability made by the Board on behalf of the named insured under the policy.

 ARTICLE 22

 DAMAGE AND REPAIR OF DAMAGE TO PROPERTY

 Section 22.1 Initial Board Determination

 . In the event of damage to any part of the Property, the Board shall promptly, and in all events within sixty (60) days after the date of damage, make the following determinations with respect thereto, employing such advice as the Board deems advisable:

 (a)

 The nature and extent of the damage, together with an inventory of the Property directly affected thereby.

 (b)

 A reasonably reliable estimate of the cost to repair the damage, which estimate shall, if reasonably practicable, be based upon two (2) or more firm bids obtained from responsible contractors. If the repair is deemed to be a public works project and if the Association is deemed to be subject to competitive bidding requirements under any applicable law, order, ordinance, or regulation, then such regulatory requirements shall control in the event of any conflict with any requirement of this Article 22.

 (c)

 The expected insurance proceeds, if any, to be available from insurance covering the loss based on the amount paid or initially offered by the insurer.

 (d)

 The amount, if any, by which the estimated cost of repair exceeds the expected insurance proceeds and the amount of the assessments that would have to be made against each Unit if the excess cost were to be paid as a maintenance expense and specially assessed against all the Units in proportion to their Allocated Interests in the Common Elements.

 (e)

 The Board's recommendation whether the damage should be repaired.

 Section 22.2 Filing Proof of Loss

 . The Board shall promptly file a proof of loss statement with its insurer if the loss is covered by insurance and abide by all terms and conditions of its insurance policies, unless the Board determines it would not be in the best interest of the Association to file a proof of loss.

 Section 22.3 Notice of Damage

 . The Board shall provide each Owner and each Institutional Holder of a First Mortgage with a written notice describing the damage and summarizing the initial Board determinations made under Section 22.1. If the Board fails to do so promptly after such damage, any Owner or Institutional Holder of a First Mortgage may make the determinations required under Section 22.1 and give the notice required under this Section 22.3.

 Section 22.4 Definitions: Damage, Repair, Emergency Work

 . As used in this Article 22:

 (a)

 Damage shall mean all kinds of damage, whether of slight degree or total destruction.

 (b)

 Repair shall mean restoring the improvements to substantially the condition they were in before they were damaged, with each Unit and the Common Elements (including Limited Common Elements) having substantially the same vertical and horizontal boundaries as before. Modifications to conform to applicable governmental rules and regulations or available means of construction may be made.

 (c)

 Emergency Work shall mean work that the Board deems reasonably necessary to avoid further damage or substantial diminution in value to the improvements and to protect the Owners from liability from the condition of the site.

 Section 22.5 Execution of Repairs.

 (a)

 The Board shall promptly repair the damage and use the available insurance proceeds therefor unless (a) the Condominium is terminated, (b) the repair or replacement would be illegal under any state or local health or safety statute or ordinance, or (c) before the repairs (other than Emergency Work) are begun the Owners decide in accordance with this Article not to repair. If the cost of repair of the Common Elements exceeds the available insurance proceeds the Board shall impose a special assessment against all Units in proportion to their Allocated Interests in the Common Elements in an aggregate amount sufficient to pay the excess costs.

 (b)

 The Board shall have the authority to employ architects and engineers, advertise for bids, let contracts to contractors and others, and take such other action as is reasonably necessary to make the repairs. Contracts for the repair work shall be awarded when the Board, by means of insurance proceeds and sufficient assessments, has provided for paying the cost. The Board may authorize the insurance carrier to make the repairs if the Board is satisfied that the work will be done satisfactorily, and if such authorization does not contravene any insurance trust agreement or requirement of law. The Board shall require any building service vendor, general contractor, or subcontractor making repairs or providing services to provide a certificate of general liability insurance evidencing coverage of not less than One Million Dollars ($1,000,000) for bodily injury or property damages liability and with aggregate limits of not less than One Million Dollars ($1,000,000).

 (c)

 The Board may enter into a written agreement with a reputable financial institution or trust or escrow company that the institution or company shall act as an insurance trustee to adjust and settle any claim for casualty loss in excess of One Hundred Thousand Dollars ($100,000) or for the institution or company to collect the insurance proceeds and carry out the provisions of this Article 22.

 Section 22.6 Damage Not Substantial; Assessment Under One Million Dollars ($1,000,000)

 . If the estimated assessment determined under subsection 22.1(d) does not exceed One Million Dollars ($1,000,000) for any one Unit, the damage will be deemed not to be substantial and the provisions of this Section 22.6 shall apply.

 (a)

 Either the Board or the requisite number of Owners may, but shall not be required to, call a special Owners' meeting in accordance with Section 13.8 and the Bylaws to decide whether to repair the damage.

 (b)

 Except for Emergency Work, no repairs shall be commenced until after the conclusion of the special meeting if such a special meeting is called.

 (c)

 A concurring vote of all Owners and eighty percent (80%) of the Institutional Holders of First Mortgages will be required to elect not to repair the damage or to rebuild in a manner different from the original design. The failure of the Board and the Owners within sixty (60) days after the date of damage to call a special Owners' meeting to decide whether to repair the damage shall be deemed a decision to repair the damage.

 Section 22.7 Substantial Damage; Assessment Over One Million Dollars ($1,000,000)

 . If the estimated assessment determined under subsection 22.1(d) is One Million Dollars ($1,000,000) or more for any one Unit, the damage will be deemed substantial and the provisions of this Section 22.7 shall apply.

 (a)

 The Board shall promptly, and in all events within sixty (60) days after the date of damage, call a special Owners' meeting to consider repairing the damage. If the Board fails to do so within sixty (60) days, then notwithstanding the provisions of Section 13.8 and the Bylaws, any Owner or Institutional Holder of a First Mortgage may call and conduct the meeting.

 (b)

 Except for Emergency Work, no repairs shall be commenced until the conclusion of the special Owners' meeting.

 (c)

 A concurring vote of all Owners will be required to elect not to repair the damage. Failure of the Board, the Owners, and the Institutional Holders of First Mortgages to conduct the special meeting provided for under subsection 22.5(a) within one hundred twenty (120) days after the date of damage shall be deemed a unanimous decision to repair the damage.

 Section 22.8 Effect of Decision Not to Repair

 . Prior to and notwithstanding a decision under either subsections 22.4(a) or 22.5(a) not to repair the damage, the Board may nevertheless expend so much of the insurance proceeds and common funds as the Board deems reasonably necessary for Emergency Work (which Emergency Work may include but is not necessarily limited to removal of the damaged improvements and clearing, filling, and grading the land), and the remaining funds, if any, and the Property shall thereafter be held and distributed as follows:

 (a)

 If Owners of all Units and eighty percent (80%) of the Institutional Holders of First Mortgagees vote to terminate the Condominium:

 (i) The Property shall be owned in common by the Owners and shall no longer be subject to this Declaration or to condominium ownership;

 (ii) Owner's respective undivided interest in the Property shall be the same as the proportion of the fair market value of that Owner's Unit and Allocated Interest in the Common Elements (as determined by one (1) or more appraisers selected by the Association) to the fair market value of all Units and Common Elements immediately before the casualty. If any Unit or any Common Element is destroyed to the extent that an appraisal of the fair market value thereof before destruction cannot be made, each Owner's respective undivided interest in the Property shall be the same as each Owner's Allocated Interest in the Common Elements immediately before the termination;

 (iii) Mortgages and other liens affecting any of the Units shall be deemed transferred in accordance with the existing priorities to the Owners' respective undivided interests in the Property; and

 (iv) The Property shall be subject to an action for partition at the suit of any Owner, in which event the net proceeds of sale, together with the net proceeds of the insurance on the Property, if any, shall be considered as one (1) fund, which fund shall be divided into separate shares, one (1) for each Owner in a percentage equal to the percentage of undivided interest owned by such Owner in the Property. After first paying out of the respective share of each Owner, to the extent sufficient for the purpose, all Mortgages and other liens on such Owner's interest, the balance remaining in each share shall be distributed to the Owner. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the right of partition shall be suspended if an agreement ("Sales Agreement") to sell the Property is provided for in an agreement ("Termination Agreement") to terminate the Condominium entered into by Owners of Units to which at least eighty percent (80%) of the votes in the Association are allocated. The suspension of the right to partition shall continue unless and until the first to occur of the following: (A) no binding obligation to sell exists three (3) months after the recording of the Termination Agreement, (B) the Sales Agreement is terminated, or (C) one (1) year after the Termination Agreement is recorded.

 (b)

 If Owners of all Units and eighty percent (80%) of the Institutional Holders of First Mortgagees do not vote to terminate the Condominium:

 (i) Insurance proceeds attributable to the damaged Common Elements shall be used to restore the damaged area to a condition compatible with the remainder of the Condominium;

 (ii) Insurance proceeds attributable to any Units and Limited Common Elements which are not rebuilt shall be distributed to the Owners of such Units and the Owners of the Units to which such Limited Common Elements were allocated, or to the holders of any Mortgages or other liens affecting such Units, as their interests may appear; and

 (iii) The remainder of the insurance proceeds shall be distributed to all of the Owners and holders of Mortgagees or other liens, as their interests may appear, in proportion to the Owners' respective Allocated Interests in the Common Elements. If the Owners vote not to rebuild any Unit, that Unit's Allocated Interest shall be automatically reallocated upon such vote as if the Unit had been condemned as provided in Article 23.

 ARTICLE 23

 CONDEMNATION

 Section 23.1 Consequences of Condemnation; Notices

 . If any Unit or portion thereof or the Common Elements (including Limited Common Elements) or any portion thereof is made the subject matter of any condemnation or eminent domain proceeding or is otherwise sought to be acquired by a condemning authority (collectively, a "Taking") notice of the Taking shall promptly be given to each Owner and to each Institutional Holder of a First Mortgage and the provisions of this Article 23 shall apply. If no Unit is owned by the condemning authority, then the Association, acting through the Board, shall represent the Owners in any proceedings, negotiations, settlements or agreements in connection with any Taking, and each Owner shall appoint the Association its attorney-in- fact for this purpose. If any Unit is owned by the condemning authority, then the Association shall be deemed to have a conflict of interest and each Owner shall represent itself in any proceedings, negotiations, settlements or agreements in connection with any Taking.

 Section 23.2 Proceeds

 . All compensation, damages, or other proceeds of the Taking (collectively, the "Award") shall be payable to the Association, as trustee for the Owners and Mortgagees as their interests may appear.

 Section 23.3 Complete Taking

 . If the entire Property is taken the Condominium ownership shall terminate effective as of the acquisition of the Property by the condemning authority. The Award shall be apportioned among the Owners in proportion to their respective Allocated Interests in the Common Elements; provided that, if a standard different from the value of the Property as a whole is employed to measure the Award in the Taking, then in determining such shares the same standard shall be employed to the extent it is relevant and applicable. On the basis of the foregoing principle, the Board shall as soon as practicable determine the share of the Award to which each Owner is entitled. Each Owner's share shall be applied first to the payment of all Mortgages and liens on the Owner's interest in accordance with the existing priorities and the balance of each share, if any, shall be distributed to the Owner.

 Section 23.4 Partial Taking

 . If less than the entire Property is taken the Condominium ownership shall not terminate. The Allocated Interests of all Units taken shall be reallocated to the remaining Units in proportion to the respective Allocated Interests of those Units before the Taking and the Association shall promptly prepare, execute and record an amendment to this Declaration reflecting the reallocations. Any remnant of a Unit remaining after part of the Unit is taken, which remnant may not practically or lawfully be used for any purpose permitted by this Declaration, shall become a Common Element effective as of the acquisition of the Property taken by the condemning authority. If part of a Unit is taken and the remaining part may be practically and lawfully used for a purpose permitted by this declaration, that Unit's Allocated Interest shall be reduced in proportion to the reduction in size of the Unit or on any other basis specified herein and the portion of the Allocated Interest divested from the partially taken Unit shall be automatically reallocated to such Unit and the remaining Units in proportion to the respective Allocated Interests of those units before the Taking, with any partially taken Unit sharing in the reallocation on the basis of its reduced Allocated Interest. Each Owner shall be entitled to a share of the Award determined in the following manner:

 (a)

 As soon as practicable the Board shall, reasonably and in good faith, allocate the Award among compensation for Property taken, severance damages, or other proceeds.

 (b)

 Any amount allocated to taking of or injury to the Common Elements shall be apportioned among Owners in proportion to their respective Allocated Interests in the Common Elements.

 (c)

 Any amount allocated to the taking or partial taking of or injury to a particular Unit, Limited Common Elements appurtenant thereto and/or improvements made by the Owner therein shall be apportioned to the Unit.

 (d)

 Any amount allocated to severance damages shall be apportioned to the Units that were not taken.

 (e)

 Any amount allocated to consequential damages and any other takings or injuries shall be apportioned as the Board determines to be equitable in the circumstances.

 (f)

 If an allocation of the Award has already been established in negotiation, judicial decree, or otherwise, then in apportioning the Award the Board shall employ that allocation to the extent it is relevant and applicable.

 (g)

 Distribution of apportioned proceeds shall be made to the Owners and their respective Mortgagees in the manner provided in Section 23.4.

 Section 23.5 Reconstruction and Repair

 . Any reconstruction and repair necessitated by a Taking shall be governed by the procedures specified in Article 22 for repair of damage; provided that the Board may retain and apply such portion of each Owner's share of the Award as is necessary to discharge the Owner's liability for any special assessment arising from the operation of Article 22.

 ARTICLE 24

 EASEMENTS

 Section 24.1 In General

 . Each Unit has an easement in and through each other Unit and the Common Elements for structural support and utility cables, wires, pipes, tanks, ducts, vents, elevator facilities, telecommunications facilities except towers, telecommunications towers existing as of January 1, 2009, outdoor building signs, heating and cooling facilities, outdoor waste container facilities, and for reasonable access thereto, as required to effectuate and continue the proper operation of the Condominium. The specific mention or reservation of any easement in this Declaration does not limit or negate the general easement for Common Elements reserved by law. Section 8.2 acknowledges certain limitations on rights of vehicle access within the Condominium to and from the Basement Unit and Floor 3 Unit.

 Section 24.2 Encroachments

 . Each Unit and all Common Elements are hereby declared to have an easement over all adjoining Units and Common Elements for the purpose of accommodating any present or future encroachment as a result of engineering errors, construction, reconstruction, repairs, settlement, shifting, or movement of any portion of the Property, or any other similar cause, and any encroachment due to Building overhang or projection. There shall be valid easements for the maintenance of the encroaching Units and/or Common Elements so long as such encroachments shall exist, and the rights and obligations of Owners shall not be altered in any way by such encroachments; provided, however, that in no event shall a valid easement for encroachment be created in favor of a Unit if the encroachment was caused by the willful act with full knowledge of the Owner. The encroachments described in this Section 24.2 shall not be construed to be encumbrances affecting the marketability of title to any Unit.

 Section 24.3 Easements and Other Rights Granted by Association

 . The Association shall have the right to grant additional permits, licenses and easements over the Common Elements for utilities, roads and other purposes necessary for the proper operation of the Condominium.

 Section 24.5 Easements Run With the Land

 . The easements, covenants, restrictions, benefits and obligations hereunder shall be perpetual and run with the land.

 ARTICLE 25

 . In the event of a subdivision, the Association shall prepare, execute and record (and the Owner of the subdivided Unit shall execute) an amendment to this Declaration and the Survey Map and Plans, subdividing the Unit, assigning identifying numbers to the Units created, and reallocating the Allocated Interests formerly allocated to the subdivided Unit to the new Units.

 (b) Relocation of Boundaries

 . In the event of a relocation of Unit boundaries, the Association shall prepare an amendment to the Declaration that identifies the Units involved and states the reallocations of Allocated Interests. The amendment must be executed by the Owners of the Units involved, contain words of conveyance between them and be recorded in the county in which the Condominium is located.

Upon a written request sent by any Mortgagee to the Association stating such Mortgagee's name and address and the Unit number or address of the Unit subject to the Mortgage held, guaranteed or insured by such Mortgagee, such Mortgagee shall be entitled to timely written notice without charge of:

 (a)

 Any condemnation or casualty loss that affects either a material portion of the Condominium or the Unit subject to the Mortgage held, insured or guaranteed by such Mortgagee;

 (b)

 Any default in payment of assessments or charges owed by the Owner of a Unit subject to the Mortgage held, insured or guaranteed by such Mortgagee, where the delinquency has not been cured in sixty (60) days;

 (c)

 Any lapse, cancellation or material modification of any insurance policy or fidelity bond maintained by the Association;

 (d)

 Any of the proposed changes referred to in Section 31.1(a) of this Declaration.

 ARTICLE 32

 CONVEYANCE OR ENCUMBRANCE OF COMMON ELEMENTS

 Portions of the Common Elements not necessary for the habitability of a Unit may be conveyed or subjected to a security interest by the Association if approved by the Owners of Units to which at least eighty percent (80%) of the votes in the Association are allocated, but in order to convey any Limited Common Elements or subject them to a security interest, all of the Owners of the Units to which such Limited Common Elements are allocated must consent in writing. Proceeds of any such sale or financing shall be an asset of the Association. Any agreement to convey Common Elements or subject them to a security interest must be evidenced by the execution of an agreement or ratification thereof in the same manner as a deed by the requisite number of Owners. The agreement must specify a date after which the agreement will be void unless recorded before that date. The agreement and all ratifications thereof must be recorded in every county in which a portion of the Condominium is located. The Association, on behalf of the Owners, may contract to convey Common Elements or subject them to a security interest but the contract shall not be enforceable against the Association until approved as required under this Article 32. Thereafter, the Association shall have all powers necessary and appropriate to effect the conveyance or encumbrance, including the power to execute deeds or other instruments. No conveyance or encumbrance of Common Elements pursuant to this Article 32 shall deprive any Unit of its rights of access and support, nor affect the priority or validity of any preexisting encumbrances.

 RIGHT OF FIRST OFFER AGREEMENT

 (NINTH AND LENORA CONDOMINIUM)

 THIS RIGHT OF FIRST OFFER AGREEMENT (this "Agreement") is made this \_\_\_\_\_\_ day of \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_, 2009, by THE CITY OF SEATTLE, a Washington municipal corporation (the "City"), and STATE OF WASHINGTON, acting by and through the Office of the Secretary of State (the "State").

 RECITALS

 A. The City owns the condominium units legally described on Exhibit A attached hereto (the "City Property").

 B. The State owns the condominium units legally described on Exhibit B attached hereto (the "State Property"). The City Property and the State Property comprise all of the units within a nonresidential condominium known as Ninth and Lenora Condominium, as more fully described on Exhibits A and B attached hereto (the "Condominium").

 C. The City and the State desire to establish certain rights relating to the City Property and the State Property as set forth in this Agreement.

 AGREEMENT

 NOW, THEREFORE, for good and valuable consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of which are hereby acknowledged, the parties hereby agree and covenant as follows:

 1. City Right of First Offer.

 a. Generally. The City shall have a right of first offer to purchase such portion of the State Property as the State may desire to sell from time to time (a "State Sale Unit"). If the State shall desire to sell a State Sale Unit, then the State first shall give the City written notice of such intent, and thereafter the City shall have sixty (60) days to submit to the State a complete binding offer, executed by an authorized official of the City, to purchase the State Sale Unit, setting forth the legal description of the State Sale Unit, the closing date (which shall be any date between six (6) and fifteen (15) months after the date of the initial offer but subsequently may be set at a later date by the mutual agreement of the City and State), the conditions precedent to the City's obligation to complete the purchase (which may include without limitation the approval of the City Council and availability of sufficient funds to pay the purchase price), and such other terms as may be customary in the form of commercial condominium purchase and sale agreement promulgated by the Commercial Broker's Association for Seattle, Washington, at the time the offer is made, except for the purchase price, which shall be determined as provided in the following subsections, and the earnest money deposit, which shall be Zero Dollars (US$0).

 b. Determination of Fair Market Value. Within fifteen (15) days following the State's receipt of the City's binding offer to purchase the State Sale Unit, the City and State shall retain a mutually agreed upon M.A.I. Appraiser to determine the fair market value of the State Sale Unit and provide a written appraisal within sixty (60) days of being retained. The cost of the appraisal shall be borne equally by the City and State. If City and State cannot agree upon an M.A.I Appraiser within fifteen (15) days as provided above, then each party shall obtain a separate appraisal performed by an appraiser meeting the criteria set forth above, the cost of which shall be paid by each party to its separately contracted appraiser and which appraisal shall be completed within sixty (60) days after the due date for agreeing upon an M.A.I. Appraiser. If the conclusions of the two appraisers do not vary by more than 10% of the higher valuation, then the fair market value of the State Sale Unit shall be the average of the two conclusions. If the conclusions vary by more than 10% of the higher valuation, then the two appraisers shall join to appoint a third appraiser within ten (10) days after the date of completion of their appraisals. Such third appraiser shall then review the two appraisals and, based upon such review, determine the fair market value of the State Sale Unit within thirty (30) days after the date of appointment. In the event such third appraiser's determination is higher than the previous high, said previous high shall be the fair market value, or in the event such third appraiser's determination is lower than the previous low, said previous low shall be the fair market value. The cost of the third appraiser, if any, shall be shared equally between the parties.

 c. Notice of Proposed Purchase Price and Acceptance of Offer. Within thirty (30) days after the completion of the appraisal process described above, the City shall deliver to the State written notice of the City's proposed purchase price of the State Sale Unit. If the City's proposed purchase price is equal to or greater than the fair market value of the State Sale Unit as determined by the appraisal process described above, then the City shall be obligated to purchase and the State shall be obligated to sell the State Sale Unit for the City's proposed purchase price and on the other terms of the City's complete binding offer described above, and within thirty (30) days after the City's delivery of written notice of its proposed purchase price the parties shall execute such purchase and sale agreement and other documents as may be reasonably necessary to evidence such obligations. If the City's proposed purchase price is less than the fair market value of the State Sale Unit as determined by the appraisal process described above, then the State may in its discretion either accept or reject the proposed purchase price; if the State accepts the proposed purchase price, then the parties shall execute such purchase and sale agreement and other documents as may be reasonably necessary to evidence their agreement, and if the State rejects the proposed purchase price, then the City shall have no right to purchase the State Sale Unit, and the State may offer and agree to sell the State Sale Unit to any third party, provided, however, that the State may not offer or agree to sell the State Sale Unit to any third party for a purchase price equal to or less than the City's proposed purchase price without granting the City the opportunity to purchase the State Sale Unit at such lesser purchase price and on such other terms as had been offered by the City. In no event shall the State accept any offer or make any agreement to sell any portion of the State Sale Unit within one hundred eighty (180) days after giving the City written notice of its intent to sell, except to the City.

 d. Termination; Subsequent Owners. The right of first offer described in this Section 2 shall bind the State but shall not bind any subsequent owner of any portion of the State Property. If the City does not submit a written offer in full compliance with the requirements set forth above within sixty (60) days after receipt of the State's notice of intent to sell, then this right of first offer shall terminate as to the State Sale Unit and the State shall be free to sell the State Sale Unit to any third party. If the City and State agree on the terms of the purchase and sale of the State Sale Unit, and if the City thereafter shall fail to complete the purchase of the State Sale Unit within the period provided in the binding agreement, then this right of first offer shall terminate as to the State Sale Unit and the State shall be free to sell the State Sale Unit to any third party. The right of first offer described in this paragraph shall terminate upon the first to occur of (a) the date twenty (20) years after the date hereof, (b) the date of termination of the Condominium, and (c) as described above, as to the State Sale Unit only, upon the failure of the City to submit a written offer or the failure of the City to complete the purchase. If the State Sale Unit does not comprise the entirety of the State Property then owned by the State, then the right of first offer shall continue in effect as to the remainder of the State Property, regardless whether or not the City exercised its right of first offer as to the State Sale Unit.

 2. State Right of First Offer.

 a. Generally. The State shall have a right of first offer to purchase such portion of the City Property as the City may desire to sell from time to time (a "City Sale Unit"). If the City shall desire to sell a City Sale Unit, then the City first shall give the State written notice of such intent, and thereafter the State shall have sixty (60) days to submit to the City a complete binding offer, executed by an authorized official of the State, to purchase the City Sale Unit, setting forth the legal description of the City Sale Unit, the closing date (which shall be any date between six (6) and fifteen (15) months after the date of the initial offer but subsequently may be set at a later date by the mutual agreement of the State and City), the conditions precedent to the State's obligation to complete the purchase (which may include without limitation the approval of the State Legislature and availability of sufficient funds to pay the purchase price), and such other terms as may be customary in the form of commercial condominium purchase and sale agreement promulgated by the Commercial Broker's Association for Seattle, Washington, at the time the offer is made, except for the purchase price, which shall be determined as provided in the following subsections, and the earnest money deposit, which shall be Zero Dollars (US$0).

 b. Determination of Fair Market Value. Within fifteen (15) days following the City's receipt of the State's binding offer to purchase the City Sale Unit, the City and State shall retain a mutually agreed upon M.A.I. Appraiser to determine the fair market value of the City Sale Unit and provide a written appraisal within sixty (60) days of being retained. The cost of the appraisal shall be borne equally by the City and State. If City and State cannot agree upon an M.A.I Appraiser within fifteen (15) days as provided above, then each party shall obtain a separate appraisal performed by an appraiser meeting the criteria set forth above, the cost of which shall be paid by each party to its separately contracted appraiser and which appraisal shall be completed within sixty (60) days after the due date for agreeing upon an M.A.I. Appraiser. If the conclusions of the two appraisers do not vary by more than 10% of the higher valuation, then the fair market value of the City Sale Unit shall be the average of the two conclusions. If the conclusions vary by more than 10% of the higher valuation, then the two appraisers shall join to appoint a third appraiser within ten (10) days after the date of completion of their appraisals. Such third appraiser shall then review the two appraisals and, based upon such review, determine the fair market value of the City Sale Unit within thirty (30) days after the date of appointment. In the event such third appraiser's determination is higher than the previous high, said previous high shall be the fair market value, or in the event such third appraiser's determination is lower than the previous low, said previous low shall be the fair market value. The cost of the third appraiser, if any, shall be shared equally between the parties.

 c. Notice of Proposed Purchase Price and Acceptance of Offer. Within thirty (30) days after the completion of the appraisal process described above, the State shall deliver to the City written notice of the State's proposed purchase price of the City Sale Unit. If the State's proposed purchase price is equal to or greater than the fair market value of the City Sale Unit as determined by the appraisal process described above, then the State shall be obligated to purchase and the City shall be obligated to sell the City Sale Unit for the State's proposed purchase price and on the other terms of the State's complete binding offer described above, and within thirty (30) days after the State's delivery of written notice of its proposed purchase price the parties shall execute such purchase and sale agreement and other documents as may be reasonably necessary to evidence such obligations. If the State's proposed purchase price is less than the fair market value of the City Sale Unit as determined by the appraisal process described above, then the City may in its discretion either accept or reject the proposed purchase price; if the City accepts the proposed purchase price, then the parties shall execute such purchase and sale agreement and other documents as may be reasonably necessary to evidence their agreement, and if the City rejects the proposed purchase price, then the State shall have no right to purchase the City Sale Unit, and the City may offer and agree to sell the City Sale Unit to any third party, provided, however, that the City may not offer or agree to sell the City Sale Unit to any third party for a purchase price equal to or less than the State's proposed purchase price without granting the State the opportunity to purchase the City Sale Unit at such lesser purchase price and on such other terms as had been offered by the State. In no event shall the City accept any offer or make any agreement to sell any portion of the City Sale Unit within one hundred eighty (180) days after giving the State written notice of its intent to sell, except to the State.

 d. Termination; Subsequent Owners. The right of first offer described in this Section 2 shall bind the City but shall not bind any subsequent owner of any portion of the City Property. If the State does not submit a written offer in full compliance with the requirements set forth above within sixty (60) days after receipt of the City's notice of intent to sell, then this right of first offer shall terminate as to the City Sale Unit and the City shall be free to sell the City Sale Unit to any third party. If the City and State agree on the terms of the purchase and sale of the City Sale Unit, and if the State thereafter shall fail to complete the purchase of the City Sale Unit within the period provided in the binding agreement, then this right of first offer shall terminate as to the City Sale Unit and the City shall be free to sell the City Sale Unit to any third party. The right of first offer described in this paragraph shall terminate upon the first to occur of (a) the date twenty (20) years after the date hereof, (b) the date of termination of the Condominium, and (c) as described above, as to the City Sale Unit only, upon the failure of the State to submit a written offer or the failure of the State to complete the purchase. If the City Sale Unit does not comprise the entirety of the City Property then owned by the City, then the right of first offer shall continue in effect as to the remainder of the City Property, regardless whether or not the State exercised its right of first offer as to the City Sale Unit.

 3. Time Is of the Essence. Time is of the essence of this Agreement. No party shall have any right to an extension of any deadline, nor any right to deliver any notice or perform any act after the date set forth in this Agreement.

 4. No Third Party Beneficiary. This Agreement is not made for the benefit of any third party.

 5. Attorneys' Fees and Costs. If any party shall bring any action arising out of this Agreement, then the losing party shall pay the prevailing party a reasonable sum for attorneys' fees and costs incurred in such suit, at trial and on appeal, and such attorneys' fees and costs shall be deemed to have accrued on the commencement of such action.

 6. General. This Agreement shall be recorded in the real property records of King County, Washington. This Agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of Washington.
