 105.3.1 Expiration. An operational permit shall remain in effect until reissued, renewed, or revoked or for such a period of time as specified in the permit. ~~Construction permits shall automatically become invalid unless the work authorized by such permit is commenced within 180 days after its issuance, or if the work authorized by such permit is suspended or abandoned for a period of 180 days after the time the work is commenced. Before such work recommences, a new permit shall be first obtained and the fee to recommence work, if any, shall be one-half the amount required for a new permit for such work, provided no changes have been made or will be made in the original construction documents for such work, and provided further that such suspension or abandonment has not exceeded one year.~~ Permits are not transferable and any change in occupancy, operation, tenancy or ownership shall require that a new permit be issued.

 105.3.3~~4~~ Conditional approval to occupy ~~permits~~. ~~Where permits are required and upon the request of a permit applicant, t~~The fire code official is authorized to recommend to the building code official that a Temporary Certificate of Occupancy be issued granting a conditional permit to occupy the premises or portion thereof before the entire work or operations on the premises is completed, provided that such portion or portions will be occupied safely prior to full completion or installation of equipment and operations without endangering life or public welfare. The fire code official shall notify the ~~permit applicant~~building code official in writing of any limitations or restrictions necessary to keep the permit area safe. The holder of a conditional permit shall proceed only to the point for which approval has been given, at the permit holder's own risk and without assurance that approval for the occupancy or the utilization of the entire premises, equipment or operations will be granted.

 105.3.4~~5~~ Posting the permit. Issued permits shall be kept on the premises designated therein at all times and shall be readily available for inspection by the fire code official.

 105.3.5~~6~~ Compliance with code. The issuance or granting of a permit shall not be construed to be a permit for, or an approval of, any violation of any of the provisions of this code or of any other ordinance of the jurisdiction. Permits presuming to give authority to violate or cancel the provisions of this code or other ordinances of the jurisdiction shall not be valid. The issuance of a permit based on construction documents and other data shall not prevent the fire code official from requiring the correction of errors in the construction documents and other data. Any addition to or alteration of approved construction documents shall be approved in advance by the fire code official, as evidenced by the issuance of a new or amended permit.

 105.3.6~~7~~ Information on the permit. The fire code official shall issue all permits required by this code on an approved form furnished for that purpose.

The applicant's policy shall evidence a "Comprehensive General Liability" (including automobile coverage) insurance limit of $2 million ($2,000,000), combined single limit per occurrence and annual aggregate, no deductible and naming the City of Seattle as an additional insured. The fire code official may increase or decrease these amounts.

 In those instances where this code requires, as a condition of issuing a permit, that the applicant for the license provide insurance, the purpose of the requirement is to insure that members of the public and the City will be compensated for losses caused by personal injury or property damage resulting from the negligent acts of the licensees or their agents or employees.

 Whenever the issuance of a permit is conditioned upon obtaining a policy or policies of public liability insurance by the applicant for such permit, the policy:

 1. Shall be issued by a company or companies authorized to do business as an insurer in Washington State pursuant to the provisions of RCW Title 48 as now or hereafter amended;

 2. Shall contain, by endorsement or otherwise, the following recital:

 "This policy is issued pursuant to Section 105 of the Seattle Fire Code of the City of Seattle for the purpose of complying with the conditions and requirements of the code.

 Where used in this Chapter, the term "Building Code" means the 1982 Seattle Building Code. Where used in this Chapter, the terms "this Code" and "the fire

 code" mean the 1982 Seattle Fire Code.

 SECTION 9301

 GENERAL

 9301.1 Purpose. The main purpose of this chapter is to improve the fire and life safety of existing high-rise buildings that do not conform to current City codes so that the health, safety and welfare of the general public is provided for and promoted. It is recognized that the application of present day fire protection techniques to some existing high-rise buildings is difficult. For this reason, this chapter may permit the use of alternative methods and innovative approaches and techniques to achieve its purpose, when approved by the chief and the Building Official.

 9301.2 Scope. This chapter applies to all high-rise buildings in existence at the time of its adoption, as well as to all high-rise buildings coming into existence after the adoption thereof.

 9301.2.1 Hazards and design features. Whenever the chief finds a condition in a high-rise building not specifically addressed in this chapter, which in the chief's opinion makes fire escape or fire fighting unusually difficult, the chief is authorized to declare it to be a hazard, notify the owner of such condition and order its correction in a manner consistent with these minimum safeguards.

 9301.2.2 Exempt Buildings. The chief and the Director of the Department of Planning and Development may exempt high-rise buildings that meet the requirements of Section 403 of the 1982 Seattle Building Code from complying with provisions of this chapter.

 9301.2.3 Conflicts. Where there is a conflict between the provisions of this chapter and the provisions of an ordinance or code adopted after January 23, 1982, the provisions of the later adopted ordinance or code apply.

 9301.3 Definitions. For the purpose of this chapter, certain words shall be construed as specified in this section.

 CENTRAL STATION: A fire alarm reporting service listed by the Underwriters Laboratories or authorized by the chief to report alarms to the Seattle Fire Department Alarm Center. In lieu of connection to a central station listed by Underwriters Laboratories, the chief may approve building staff monitoring of a fire alarm annunciator panel where:

 1. Such staff are properly trained to monitor the annunciator panel and report alarm signals to the fire department alarm center via the 9-1-1 system.

 2. One or more building staff is on duty 24 hours a day and remains in the direct vicinity of the annunciator panel, e.g., a hotel desk clerk where the panel is behind the registration desk.

 3. Staff persons are available in low income high-rise buildings whose primary duty requires them to be at the front desk.

 DEAD-END CORRIDOR: A corridor which permits only one direction of travel from a unit or normally occupied room door to an exit, or which intersects an exit corridor on one end and does not provide an exit path on the other end. A corridor which has fire escapes directly accessible from it is not a dead-end corridor.

 FLOOR USED FOR HUMAN OCCUPANCY: A floor designed and intended for occupancy by one or more persons for any part of a day, including a roof garden and an active storage area. An area that is permanently unoccupied or is occupied for the service of building equipment only is not included in this definition.

 HIGH-RISE BUILDING: Buildings having floors used for human occupancy located more than 75 feet above the lowest level of fire department vehicle access.

 LOW INCOME RESIDENTIAL BUILDINGS: Those buildings that meet the following requirements:

 1. At least fifty percent (50%) of the dwelling or housing units as defined in the Seattle Housing and Building Maintenance Code (Seattle Municipal Code Ch. 22.204) are rented to non-transient persons at a rent at or below .9% of the current median income for all families in the Seattle area as determined by the United States Department of Housing and Urban Development; and

 2. The average monthly rent for all dwelling or housing units in the building does not exceed 1.4% of the Median Income Limit.

 For purposes of calculating the average monthly rent, a room which is rented on a hostel-style basis to three (3) or more non-related persons shall be considered as one room rented for $200 per month.

 Monthly rent shall include all charges for shelter and provision of items normally associated with such use, but shall not include board, health care, telephone charges and other such items.

 SECTION 9302

 EXITS

 9302.1 General. All exits in high-rise buildings shall be illuminated as required in Section 1211 of this Code and enclosed with a minimum of one-hour fire resistive construction. Every high-rise building shall have at least one such exit. Where existing exterior fire escapes are used for additional exits, they shall be tested and identified as required in Section 9302.3.

 9302.2 Smokeproof enclosure. Where a high-rise building has a single, enclosed exit, the enclosure shall be continued to the exterior of the building and the exit shall be smoke-proof by mechanical ventilation in accordance with Section 3310 of the 1982 Seattle Building Code, or shall be mechanically pressurized with fresh air to 0.15 inches water column and shall have a concurrent 2500 cubic feet per minute (CFM) exhaust to atmosphere in an emergency, in accordance with the provisions of the Building Code.

 Exceptions:

 1. Pressurization may be omitted when the building has an approved automatic sprinkler system, all corridor openings are self-closing, all occupied areas have access to a second means of egress or a fire escape and the omission is approved by the chief.

 2. A single stair may exit through a building lobby, where the lobby is of non- combustible construction, does not contain combustible furnishings, and is separated from the rest of the building by one-hour fire-resistive construction. Wire-glass protected by sprinklers on both sides may be accepted as one-hour fire-resistive construction.
