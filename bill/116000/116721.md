 ORDINANCE ___________

 AN ORDINANCE relating to the rates, terms and conditions for the use and sale of electricity supplied by the City Light Department; and amending Seattle Municipal Code Chapter 21.49 in connection therewith.

 WHEREAS, Resolution 30428, adopted by the City Council on December 10, 2001, established the financial policy for City Light that net revenue available to fund capital requirements in each calendar year should be positive with a probability of at least 95%, taking into account the variability of cash flows resulting from the uncertainty of water conditions, market prices and system load; and

 WHEREAS, Resolution 30761, adopted by the City Council on May 2, 2005, affirmed the policy described above and added the financial policy that rates should also be set to ensure a first and second lien debt service coverage ratio of 2.0; and

 WHEREAS, Resolution 30933, adopted by the City Council on November 20, 2006, established long-term rate setting objectives and electric rate policies for the City Light Department; and

 WHEREAS, Ordinance 120247, passed by the City Council on January 29, 2001, established an automatic BPA cost adjustment, which was reaffirmed and amended most recently in Ordinance 122282, passed by the City Council on November 20, 2006; and

 WHEREAS, as BPA notified City Light that new higher rates for the power it supplies to City Light would go into effect as of October 1, 2009, City Light automatically added the amount of $0.001 to the kilowatt-hour charges in all rate schedules that include energy charges per kilowatt- hour, except that $0.0005 was added to the energy charges in residential rate assistance schedules in accordance with SMC 21.49.081; and

 WHEREAS, in accordance with SMC 21.49.081, BPA pass-through rates took effect automatically on October 1, 2009; and

 WHEREAS, SMC 21.49.081 provides that lighting rate schedules T, P and F are exempted from the automatic BPA increment and that residential rate assistance rate schedules should be increased or decreased by one-half the BPA increment, but City Light has recommended that Schedules T, P and F should be subject to the full automatic BPA increment, while rate assistance rate schedules should be increased or decreased by forty percent (40%) of the BPA increment in order to be consistent with the percentage increases normally applied to these schedules when comprehensive rate increases are adopted; and

 WHEREAS, Ordinance 122282, passed by the City Council on November 20, 2006, established comprehensive rates, terms, and conditions for the use and sale of electricity supplied by City Light; and

 WHEREAS, Ordinance 122523, which was passed by the City Council on October 1, 2007, Ordinance 122679, which was passed by the City Council on April 28, 2008, and Ordinance 122910, which was passed by the City Council on February 9, 2009, established new rates for City Light customers in the City of Shoreline pursuant to the terms of the franchise agreement with that city; and

 WHEREAS, Ordinance 122903, passed by the City Council on January 20, 2009, changed the income thresholds for low-income customers to be eligible for rate assistance; and

 WHEREAS, Ordinance 122998, passed by the City Council on June 1, 2009, established new rates for City Light customers in the City of Burien pursuant to the terms of the franchise agreement with that city, but contained certain inaccuracies in its reference to SMC 21.49.040, which did not effectively amend the language previously established in Ordinance 122903; and

 WHEREAS, the City Council has reviewed City Light's costs of providing electric service and has determined that they have increased beyond the level that can be sustained by the rates currently in effect; and

 WHEREAS, the City Council has determined that the required rate increase should be implemented on January 1, 2010, in the form of an across-the- board increase of 13.8%; and

 WHEREAS, Ordinance 122335, passed by the City Council on July 6, 2009, established a Rates Advisory Committee (RAC) in order to provide for a public input process prior to the establishment of new comprehensive City Light rates and, before passage of this legislation, the RAC will have submitted its recommendation regarding this proposal to the City Council; and

 WHEREAS, City Light proposes to increase the penalty for unauthorized attachments to its poles and other facilities from three times the annual rental rate to five times the annual rental rate, plus interest, in order to provide a more meaningful deterrent to such attachments, to ensure that City Light receives the appropriate revenue from such attachments, and to be consistent with national practices; and

 WHEREAS, the City Council has reviewed the rates, terms, and conditions set out within this Ordinance, has determined they are consistent with the financial policies supported by the Council, and believes they will continue to provide the users of electric service supplied by the City of Seattle efficient electric service at low cost; NOW THEREFORE,

The full annual rental rate shall be charged for the year in which an installation or attachment is made, regardless of what point in the year use of City Light facilities commences.

 Each lessee shall submit annually to City Light an inventory listing the amount of duct and vault space and the number of poles used, together with the location of all ducts, vaults and poles used. This inventory shall be effective as of January 1st of each year and submitted to City Light no later than February 1st of each year. Rental charges shall be due within thirty (30) days of invoice by City Light. Any installations or attachments not identified in the lessee's inventory shall be charged at ~~three (3)~~five (5) times the rental rates set forth below plus interest. Interest charged is to be at the statutory nominal percentage rate, compounded monthly.

 In addition, in the event the lessee fails to submit an annual inventory, the lessee shall also reimburse City Light for all costs, including loaded employee time, associated with performing an inventory of lessee's use of City Light facilities.

 RATES EFFECTIVE JANUARY 1, 2007:

 Section 9. Section 21.49.081 of the Seattle Municipal Code is amended to read as follows:

 SMC 21.49.081 Automatic BPA Cost Adjustment

 Each time that BPA adjusts its rates from those in its block and slice power sales agreements (PSAs) with City Light effective as of January 1, 2007, City Light will calculate the difference (in dollars) between what City Light would have paid for its BPA purchases under the PSAs for a twelve (12) month period beginning on the effective date of the BPA adjustment and what City Light will actually pay for the same period under the adjusted BPA rates. The dollar difference will then be multiplied by 1.1095, which is the effective tax rate, and the product divided by forecast load (in kWh) over the twelve (12) month period to calculate a number (in dollars/kWh rounded to the nearest ten thousandth of a dollar) which will be called the "BPA increment."

 For example, if an increase in BPA PSA rates results in increased costs to the Department of $18,422,543 per year, this amount would be multiplied by the 1.1095 effective tax rate to get required additional customer revenue of $20,439,811. The additional revenue required would then be divided by the forecast kWh load to calculate the BPA increment.

 As soon as practical after a BPA adjustment in PSA rates, energy charges in effect under all rate schedules ~~except Schedules T, P, and F~~ will be increased or decreased by the BPA increment, provided that for customers served under Schedules REC, RLC, RET, RLT, RES, ~~and~~ RLS, REH, RLH, REB and RLB, energy charges shall be increased or decreased by ~~one-half (1/2)~~forty percent (40%) of the BPA increment. The BPA increment will increase or decrease equally first block and second block charges in residential rates and peak and off-peak rates for large and high demand general service customers as well as the single energy charges for small and medium general service customers and the energy charge portion of Schedules T, P and F.

 If at any time after December 31, 2006 BPA announces an adjustment in the rates to be charged under the PSAs to City Light, then City Light shall compute the BPA increment for the purpose of ensuring that only the increase or decrease in costs under the PSA will be passed through to City Light's customers. The increment will be based on the projected load for a twelve (12) month period. City Light's rates shall be adjusted to give effect to the BPA increment, and the adjusted rates shall take effect after the effective date of the adjusted BPA rates as soon as the billing process can be implemented.

 Section 10. Subsection K of Section 21.49.100 of the Seattle Municipal Code is amended to read as follows:

 SMC 21.49.100 Application and Contract Provisions

 K. Account Service Charge. An applicant or a customer shall be charged an account service charge for establishing an account. The charge shall be included in the initial billing to the first permanent occupant after the establishment of an account. The schedule of charges shall be established through the Administrative Code process.1 The account service charge shall not apply in the following cases:

 1. For a name, address, or rate schedule change involving the same premises and account, or the addition of names to existing accounts;

 2. For temporary service used for the purpose of new construction;

 3. For meters or other charges added to an existing account;

 4. For customers billed on Schedules REC, RES, RET, REH, REB, RLT, RLC,~~and~~ RLS, RLH and RLB;

 5. For the transfer of responsibility for an existing account for service to an existing premises from the occupant of record to another party, and the assumption by that other party of the obligation to pay for the service, when no opening or closing of the account is involved;

 6. For billing of vacancy current to property owners or authorized agent;

 7. For a change in status between vacant and occupied.

 Section 11. This ordinance shall take effect and be in force thirty (30) days from and after its approval by the Mayor, but if not approved and returned by the Mayor within ten (10) days after presentation, it shall take effect as provided by Municipal Code Section 1.04.020.
