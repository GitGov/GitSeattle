Revenues may be used for, but are not exclusive to, the following component programs:

 A. Public Areas Maintenance

Records for the initial assessment calculation are based on information provided by the King County Assessor's Office for the year 2008. The CCBIA will update property data annually based on information provided by the King County Assessor's Office. Property owned by governmental entities or public utilities shall not be assessed.

 Section 5. Rate Changes. Changes in the assessment rate shall only be made by ordinance and as authorized in RCW 35.87A.140.

The composition of the Board shall be representative of the CCBIA. The Director may appoint additional members to the Ratepayers Advisory Board to ensure that a broad representation of Ratepayers is provided.
