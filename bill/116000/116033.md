 SECTION 1005 - ABOVE-GRADE WALLS

 1005.1 General: Table 10-5, 10-5A and 10-5B list heat loss coefficients for the opaque portion of above-grade wood stud frame walls, metal stud frame walls and concrete masonry walls (Btu/h?ft2? degrees F) respectively. They are derived from procedures listed in Standard RS-1, listed in Chapter 7. For intermediate floor slabs which penetrate the insulated wall, use the concrete wall U-factors in Table 10-5B(5).

 Insulation is assumed to uniformly fill the entire cavity and to be installed as per manufacturer's directions. All walls are assumed to be finished on the inside with 1/2 inch gypsum wallboard, and on the outside with either beveled wood siding over 1/2 inch plywood sheathing or with 5/8 inch T1-11 siding. Insulated sheathing (either interior or exterior) is assumed to cover the entire opaque wall surface.

Metal building walls have a different construction and are addressed in Table 10-5A(3).

***

 1005.3 Component Description: Default coefficients for ~~four~~ the following types of walls are listed: single-stud walls, ~~metal stud walls,~~ strap walls, and double-stud walls, log walls, stress-skin panels, metal stud walls, metal building walls, .

 Single-Stud Wall, Tables 10-5(1)-(8): Assumes either 2x4 or 2x6 studs framed on 16 or 24 inch centers. Headers are solid for 2x4 walls and double 2x for 2x6 walls, with either dead-air or rigid- board insulation in the remaining space.

~~Metal Stud Wall: Assumes metal studs spaced on 16 or 24 inch centers with insulation installed to fill wall cavities. Continuous rigid board insulation is applied without creating uninsulated voids in the wall assembly.~~

 Strap Wall, Table 10-5(9): Assumes 2x6 studs framed on 16 or 24 inch centers. 2x3 or 2x4 strapping is run horizontally along the interior surface of the wall to provide additional space for insulation.

 Double-Stud Wall, Tables 10-5(10)-(11): Assumes an exterior structural wall and a separate interior, non-structural wall. Insulation is placed in both wall cavities and in the space between the two walls. Stud spacing is assumed to be on 24 inch centers for both walls.

Log Wall, Table 10-5(12).  Stress-Skin Panel, Table 10-5(13).

 Metal Stud Wall, Overall Assembly U-Factors, Table 10-5A(1): Assumes metal studs spaced on 16 or 24 inch centers with insulation installed to fill wall cavities. Continuous rigid board insulation is applied without creating uninsulated voids in the wall assembly.

 Metal Stud Wall, Effective R-Values for Metal Framing and Cavity Only, Table 10-5A(2): These values may be used for the metal- framing/cavity layer in walls metal studs spaced on 16 or 24 inch centers with insulation installed to fill wall cavities in lieu of using the zone method provided in Chapter 25 of Standard RS-1 listed in Chapter 7.

 Metal Building Wall, Table 10-5A(3): A wall whose structure consists of metal spanning panels supported by steel structural members (does not include spandrel glass or metal panels in curtain wall systems). The first nominal R-Value is for insulation compressed between metal wall panels and the steel structure. For double-layer installations, the second rated R-value of insulation is for insulation installed from the inside, covering the girts. For continuous insulation (e.g., insulation boards) it is assumed that the insulation boards are installed on the inside of the girts and uninterrupted by the framing members. Insulation exposed to the conditioned space or semiheated space shall have a facing, and all insulation seams shall be continuously sealed to provide a continuous air barrier.

 Concrete Masonry, 8", Table 10-5B(1a). Group R occupancy.

 Concrete Masonry, 12", Table 10-5B(1b). Group R occupancy.

 Clay Brick, 8", Table 10-5B(1c). Group R occupancy.

 Concrete, 6" Poured or Precast, Table 10-5B(1d). Group R occupancy.

Notes for Default Table 10-5B(2)  1. It is acceptable to use the U-factors in Table 10-5B(2) for all concrete and masonry walls, provided that the grouting is equal to or less than that specified.

 - For ungrouted walls, use the partially-grouted column.

 - For metal studs and z-furring, use the continuous-metal-framing category.

 - For discontinuous metal clips 1 inch square or smaller, use the metal-clip category.

 - For insulation that is attached without any framing members (e.g. glued), use the continuous-insulation-uninterrupted-by-framing category. Continuous insulation may be installed on the interior or exterior of masonry walls, or between stand-alone walls in multi- layer masonry walls, or on the interior or exterior of the concrete.

 2. For Table 10-5B(2), the U-factor includes R-0.17 for exterior air film and R-0.68 for interior air film - vertical surfaces. For insulated walls, the U-factor also includes R-0.45 for 0.5 in. gypsum board. U-factors are provided for the following configurations:

(a) Concrete wall: 8-in. normal weight concrete wall with a density of 145 lb/ft3.

(b) Solid grouted concrete block wall: 8-in. medium weight ASTM C90 concrete block with a density of 115 lb/ft3 and solid grouted cores.

(c) Partially grouted concrete block wall: 8-in. medium weight ASTM C90 concrete block with a density of 115 lb/ft3 having reinforcing steel every 32 in. vertically and every 48 in. horizontally, with cores grouted in those areas only. Other cores are filled with insulating material only if there is no other insulation.  3. For walls with insulation contained in a framing layer, the U- factors in Table 10-5B(2) assume contact (and thermal bridging) between the mass wall and other framing. For wall assemblies with multiple layers where the wood or metal framing layer does not contact the concrete or masonry layer (i.e. walls with an airspace between the stud wall layer and the mass wall layer), it is acceptable to use the appropriate wood or metal frame wall default U- factors in Tables 10-5 or 10-5A. Note, it is acceptable to use this approach where the insulation extends beyond the framing and is in contact with the mass wall layer (e.g. a nominal four-inch metal stud containing insulation that is nominally six inches thick and therefore extends two inches beyond the back of the metal stud).

 4. Except for wall assemblies qualifying for note 3, if not taken from Table 10-5B(2), mass wall U-factors shall be determined in accordance with ASHRAE/IESNA Standard 90.1-2004, Appendix A, Section A3.1 and Tables A3.1A to A3.1D, or Section A9.4. If not taken from Table 10-9, heat capacity for mass walls shall be taken from ASHRAE/IESNA Standard 90.1-2004, Appendix A, Table A3.1B or A3.1C.

 SECTION 1007 -- CEILINGS

 1007.1 General: Table 10-7 lists heat loss coefficients for the opaque portion of exterior ceilings below vented attics, vaulted ceilings and roof decks in units of Btu/h?ft2? degrees F of ceiling.

 They are derived from procedures listed in Standard RS-1, listed in Chapter 7. Ceiling U-factors are modified for the buffering effect of the attic, assuming an indoor temperature of 65 degrees F and an outdoor temperature of 45 degrees F.

 Metal Framed Ceilings: The nominal R-values in Table 10-5A(2): Effective R-Values for Metal Framing and Cavity Only may be used for

 purposes of calculating metal framed ceiling section U-factors in lieu of the ASHRAE zone calculation method as provided in Chapter 25 of Standard RS-1.

Metal building roofs have a different construction and are addressed in Table 10-7(F).

1007.2 Component Description: The ~~four~~ types of ceilings are characterized as follows:

 Ceilings Below a Vented Attic: Attic insulation is assumed to be blown-in, loose-fill fiberglass with a K-value of 2.6 h?ft2? degrees F/Btu per inch. Full bag count for specified R-value is assumed in all cases. Ceiling dimensions for flat ceiling calculations are 45 by 30 feet, with a gabled roof having a 4/12 pitch. The attic is assumed to vent naturally at the rate of 3 air changes per hour through soffit and ridge vents. A void fraction of 0.002 is assumed for all attics with insulation baffles. Standard-framed, unbaffled attics assume a void fraction of 0.008.

 Attic framing is either standard or advanced. Standard framing assumes tapering of insulation depth around the perimeter with resultant decrease in thermal resistance. An increased R-value is assumed in the center of the ceiling due to the effect of piling leftover insulation. Advanced framing assumes full and even depth of

 insulation extending to the outside edge of exterior walls. Advanced framing does not change from the default value.

 U-factors for flat ceilings below vented attics with standard framing may be modified with the following table:

 U-factor for Roof Pitch Standard Framing

 R-30 R-38

 4/12 0.036 0.031

 5/12 0.035 0.030

 6/12 0.034 0.029

 7/12 0.034 0.029

 8/12 0.034 0.028

 9/12 0.034 0.028

 10/12 0.033 0.028

 11/12 0.033 0.027

 12/12 0.033 0.027

 Vented scissors truss attics assume a ceiling pitch of 2/12 with a roof pitch of either 4/12 or 5/12. Unbaffled standard framed scissors truss attics are assumed to have a void fraction of 0.016.

 Vaulted Ceilings: Insulation is assumed to be fiberglass batts installed in roof joist cavities. In the vented case, at least 1.5 inches between the top of the batts and the underside of the roof sheathing is left open for ventilation in each cavity. A ventilation rate of 3.0 air changes per hour is assumed. In the unvented or

 dense pack case, the ceiling cavity is assumed to be fully packed with insulation, leaving no space for ventilation.

 Roof Decks: Rigid insulation is applied to the top of roof decking with no space left for ventilation. Roofing materials are attached directly on top of the insulation. Framing members are often left exposed on the interior side.

 Metal Truss Framing: Overall system tested values for the roof/ceiling Uo for metal framed truss assemblies from approved laboratories shall be used, when such data is acceptable to the building official.

 Alternatively, the Uo for roof/ceiling assemblies using metal truss framing may be obtained from Tables 10-7A, 10-7B, 10-7C, 10-7D, and 10-7E.

Steel Truss Framed Ceiling, Table 10-7A.  Steel Truss Framed Ceiling with R-3 Sheathing, Table 10-7B.

 Steel Truss Framed Ceiling with R-5 Sheathing, Table 10-7C.

 Steel Truss Framed Ceiling with R-10 Sheathing, Table 10-7D.

 Steel Truss Framed Ceiling with R-15 Sheathing, Table 10-7E.

 Metal Building Roof, Table 10-7F: the base assembly is a roof where the insulation is draped over the steel structure (purlins) and then compressed when the metal roof panels are attached to the steel structure (purlins). Additional assemblies include continuous insulation, uncompressed and uninterrupted by framing.

The first nominal R-value is for insulation draped over purlins and then compressed when the metal roof panels are attached, or for insulation hung between the purlins. A minimum 1 in. R-5 thermal spacer block between the purlins and the metal roof panels is required when specified in Table 10-7F.

For double-layer installations, the second nominal R-value is for insulation installed parallel to the purlins.

For continuous insulation (e.g., insulation boards or blankets), it is assumed that the insulation is installed below the purlins and is uninterrupted by framing members. Insulation exposed to the conditioned space or semiheated space shall have a facing, and all insulation seams shall be continuously sealed to provide a continuous air barrier.  Roofs with Insulation Entirely Above Deck (uninterrupted by framing), Table 10-7G: the base assembly is continuous insulation over a structural deck. Added insulation is continuous and uninterrupted by framing. For the insulation, the first column lists the R-value for continuous insulation with a uniform thickness; the second column

 lists the comparable area-weighted average R-value for continuous insulation provided that the insulation thickness is never less than R-5 (except at roof drains) and that the slope is no greater than 1/4 inch per foot.

 1132.3 Lighting and Motors: Where the use in a space changes from one use in Table 15-1 to another use in Table 15-1, the installed lighting wattage shall comply with Section 1521 or 1531.

 Other tenant improvements, alterations or repairs where 60 percent or more of the fixtures in a space enclosed by walls or ceiling-height partitions are new shall comply with Sections 1531 and 1532. (Where this threshold is triggered, the areas of the affected spaces may be combined for lighting code compliance calculations.)

 Where less than 60 percent of the fixtures in s apace enclosed by walls or ceiling-height partitions are new, the installed lighting wattage shall be maintained or reduced. Where 60 percent or more of the lighting fixtures in a suspended ceiling are new, and the existing insulation is on the suspended ceiling, the roof/ceiling assembly shall be insulated according to the provisions of Chapter 13, Section 1311.2.

 Where new wiring is being installed to serve added fixtures and/or fixtures are being relocated to a new circuit (except as noted in the following paragraph), controls shall comply with Sections 1513.1 through 1513.5 and, as applicable, 1513.7. For compliance with Section 1513.3.2 for existing luminaires where the existing ballasts are not being changed, the number of required incremental steps of automatic daylighting control shall be equal to one plus the number of ballasts in the luminaire. In addition, office areas less than 300 ft2 enclosed by walls or ceiling-height

 partitions, and all meeting and conference rooms, and all school classrooms, shall be equipped with occupancy sensors that comply with Section 1513.6 and 1513.7. Where a new lighting panel (or a moved lighting panel) with all new raceway and conductor wiring from the panel to the fixtures is being installed, controls shall also comply with the other requirements in Sections 1513.6 and 1513.7.

 Where new walls or ceiling-height partitions are added to an existing space and create a new enclosed space, but the lighting fixtures are not being changed, other than being relocated, the new enclosed space shall have controls that comply with Sections 1513.1 through 1513.2, 1513.4, and 1513.6 through 1513.7.

 Those motors which are altered or replaced shall comply with Section 1511.

 a. Any unconditioned space that is altered to become semi-heated, cooled, or fully heated, or any semi-heated space that is altered to become cooled or fully heated space shall be required to be brought into full compliance with this Code. For spaces constructed prior to this Code, the installed heating output capacity shall not exceed 16 Btu/h per square foot unless the building envelope complies with Chapter 13. Existing warehouses and repair shops are considered unconditioned space unless they are indicated as conditioned space in DPD records or they were built after 1980 and they comply with the building envelope requirements for conditioned space in effect at the time of construction. (See the Seattle Mechanical Code for requirements for combustion appliances.)

 b. Any Group R Occupancy which is converted to other than a Group R Occupancy shall be required to comply with all of the provisions of Sections 1130 through 1132 of this Code.

 ***

 1144 Violations and Penalties~~:It shall be a violation of this Code for any person, firm, or corporation to erect or construct any building, or remodel or rehabilitate any existing building or structure in the state, or allow the same to be done, contrary to any of the provisions of this Code.~~

1144.1 Violations: It is a violation of this Code for anyone to:  1. erect, construct, enlarge, repair, move, improve, remove, convert, demolish, equip, occupy, inspect or maintain any building or structure in the City, contrary to or in violation of any of the provisions of this Code.

 2. knowingly aid, abet, counsel, encourage, hire, commend, induce or otherwise procure another to violate or fail to comply with this Code.

 3. use any material or to install any device, appliance or equipment which does not comply with the applicable standards of this Code or which has not been approved by the building official.

 4. violate or fail to comply with any final order issued by the building official pursuant to the provisions of this code or with any requirements of this code.

 5. remove, mutilate, destroy or conceal any notice or order issued or posted by the building official pursuant to the provisions of this code, or any notice or order issued or posted by the building official in response to a natural disaster or other emergency.

 1144.2 Notice of Violation: If after investigation the building official determines that standards or requirements of this code have been violated, the building official may serve a notice of violation upon the owner or other person responsible for the action or condition. The notice of violation shall state the standards or requirements violated, shall state what corrective action, if any, is necessary to comply with the standards or requirements, and shall set a reasonable time for compliance. The notice shall be served upon the owner or other responsible person by regular first class mail addressed to the last known address of such person. In addition, a copy of the notice may be posted at a conspicuous place on the property. The notice may also be posted even if served by personal service or first class mail. The notice of violation shall be considered an order of the building official. Nothing in this subsection shall be deemed to limit or preclude any action or proceeding pursuant to Sections 102, 103 or 104 of the Seattle Building Code, and nothing in this section shall be deemed to obligate or require the building official to issue a notice of violation prior to the imposition of civil or criminal penalties.

 1144.2.1 Review by the building official for notice of violation

 1144.2.1.1 Any person affected by a notice of violation issued pursuant to Section 1144.2 may obtain a review of the notice by making a request in writing within ten days after service of the notice. When the last day of the period computed is a Saturday, Sunday, federal or City holiday, the period runs until 5:00 p.m. of the next business day. The review shall occur not less than ten nor more than twenty days after the request is received by the building official unless otherwise agreed by the person requesting the review. Any person aggrieved by or interested in the notice of violation may submit additional information to the building official.

 1144.2.1.2 The review shall be made by a representative of the building official who will review any additional information that is submitted and the basis for issuance of the notice of violation. The reviewer may request clarification of the information received and a site visit. After the review, the building official shall:

 1. Sustain the notice; or

 2. Withdraw the notice; or

 3. Continue the review to a date certain; or

 4. Amend the notice.

 1144.2.1.3 The building official shall issue an order containing the decision within 15 days of the date that the review is completed and shall cause the order to be mailed by regular first class mail to the persons requesting the review and the persons named on the notice of violation, addressed to their last known address.

 1144.2.1.4 Because civil actions to enforce Title 22 SMC are brought in Seattle Municipal Court pursuant to Section 1144.3.2, orders of the building official issued under this chapter are not subject to judicial review pursuant to chapter 36.70C RCW.

1144.3 Civil Penalties:  1144.3.1 Any person violating or failing to comply with the

 provisions of this code shall be subject to a cumulative civil penalty in an amount not to exceed $500 per day for each violation from the date the violation occurs or begins until compliance is achieved. In cases where the building official has issued a notice of violation, the violation will be deemed to begin, for purposes of determining the number of days of violation, on the date compliance is required by notice of violation.

 1144.3.2 Civil actions to enforce this chapter shall be brought exclusively in Seattle Municipal Court, except as otherwise required by law or court rule. In any civil action for a penalty, the City has the burden of proving by a preponderance of the evidence that a violation exists or existed; the issuance of the notice of violation or of an order following a review by the building official is not itself evidence that a violation exists.

 1144.4 Alternative Criminal Penalty: Anyone who violates or fails to comply with any order issued by the building official pursuant to this code or who removes, mutilates, destroys or conceals a notice issued or posted by the building official shall, upon conviction thereof, be punished by a fine of not more than $5000 or by imprisonment for not more than 365 days, or by both such fine and imprisonment. Each day's violation or failure to comply shall constitute a separate offense.

 1144.5 Additional Relief: The building official may seek legal or equitable relief to enjoin any acts or practices and abate any condition when necessary to achieve compliance.

 1144.6 Recording of Orders and Notices: The building official may record a copy of any order or notice with the Department of Records and Elections of King County. The building official may record with

 the Department of Records and Elections of King County a notification that a permit has expired without a final inspection after reasonable efforts have been made to provide a final inspection.

1150 Conflicts with Other Codes: In case of conflicts among Codes enumerated in RCW 19.27.031 subsections (1), (2), (3) and (4) and this Code, the first named Code shall govern. The duct insulation requirements in this Code or a local jurisdiction's energy code, whichever is more stringent, supersede the requirements in the Mechanical Code.

Additional efficiency standards for electrical energy use may also appear in Seattle City Light service requirements, which should be consulted.

 Where, in any specific case, different sections of this Code specify different materials, methods of construction or other requirements, the most restrictive shall govern. Where there is a conflict between a general requirement and a specific requirement, the specific requirement shall be applicable.

 1160 Severability and Liability

 ***

 1162 Liability: Nothing contained in this Code is intended to be nor shall be construed to create or form the basis for any liability on the part of ~~any city or county~~the City or its officers, employees or agents for any injury or damage resulting from the failure of a building to conform to the provisions of this Code, or by reason of or in consequence of any inspection, notice, order, certificate, permission of approval authorized or issued or done in connection with the implementation or enforcement of this Code, or by reason of any action or inaction on the part of the City related in any manner to the enforcement of this Code or by its officers or agents. This code shall not be construed to lessen or relieve the responsibility of any person owning, operating or controlling any building or structure for any damages to persons or property caused by defects, nor shall the Department of Planning and Development or the City of Seattle be held to have assumed any such liability by reason of the inspections authorized by this code or any permits or certificates issued under this code.

 Section The following sections of Chapter 13 of the 2006 Washington State Energy Code are amended as follows:

 CHAPTER 13

 BUILDING ENVELOPE

 1301 Scope: Conditioned buildings or portions thereof shall be constructed to provide the required thermal performance of the various components according to the requirements of this chapter. Unless otherwise approved by the building official, all spaces shall be assumed to be at least semi-heated.

 EXCEPTIONS:

 1. Greenhouses isolated from any conditioned space and not intended for occupancy.

 2. As approved by the building official, spaces not assumed to be at least semi-heated.

 3. Unconditioned Group U occupancy accessory to Group R occupancy.

 4. Unstaffed equipment shelters or cabinets used solely for personal wireless service facilities.

5. Parking lot attendant booths no larger than 100 square feet, provided that the roof insulation is R-21 minimum and the wall insulation is R-13 minimum, unless otherwise allowed by Section 1310.

***

 1310.2 Semi-Heated Spaces: All spaces shall be considered conditioned spaces, and shall comply with the requirements in Section 1310.1 unless they meet the following criteria for semi-heated spaces. The installed heating equipment output, in Climate Zone 1, shall be 3 Btu/(h * ft2) or greater but not greater than 8 Btu/(h * ft2) and in Climate Zone 2, shall be 5 Btu/(h * ft2) or greater but not greater than 12 Btu/(h * ft2).

 For semi-heated spaces, the building envelope shall comply with the same requirements as that for conditioned spaces in Section 1310.1. However, semi-heated spaces shall be calculated separately from other conditioned spaces for compliance purposes.

 EXCEPTION: For semi-heated spaced heated by other fuels only, wall insulation is not required for those walls that separate semi- heated spaces (see definition in Section 201.1) from the exterior provided that the space is heated solely by a heating system controlled by a thermostat with a maximum setpoint capacity of 45 degrees F, mounted no lower than the heating unit.

 ***

 1311.6 Radiant Floors (on or below grade): Slab on grade insulation shall extend downward from the top of the slab a minimum distance of 36 inches or downward to the top of the footing and horizontal for an aggregate of not less that 36 inches.

~~If required by the building official where soil conditions warrant such insulation,~~~~the~~The entire area of radiant floor shall be thermally isolated from the soil. Where a

 soil gas control system is provided below the radiant floor, which results in increased convective flow below the radiant floor, the radiant floor shall be thermally isolated from the sub-floor gravel layer.

 ***

 1312.2 Solar Heat Gain Coefficient and ~~Shading Coefficient~~ Visible Transmittance: Solar Heat Gain Coefficient (SHGC) and Visible Transmittance (VT), shall be determined, certified and labeled in accordance with the National Fenestration Rating Council (NFRC) Standard by a certified, independent agency, licensed by the NFRC.

 EXCEPTIONS: 1. Shading coefficients (SC) or solar heat gain coefficient for the center of glass shall be an acceptable alternate for compliance with solar heat gain coefficient requirements. Shading coefficients or solar heat gain coefficient for the center of glass for glazing shall be taken from Chapter 31 of Standard RS-1 or from the manufacturer's ~~test~~data using a spectral data file determined in accordance with NFRC 300.

2. For the purposes of 1323, Exception 1, visible transmittance for the center of the glazing assembly shall be taken from Chapter 31 of Standard RS-1 or from the manufacturer's data using a spectral data file determined in accordance with NFRC 300.

Note that using the exception for the SHGC for the center-of- glass does not give the full credit for the overall product (including the frame) that the NFRC-certified SHGC does. Though the SHGC for the frame is not zero (the ASHRAE Handbook of Fundamentals indicates that the SHGC can range from 0.11-0.14 for metal frames and  from 0.02-0.07 for wood/vinyl/fiberglass frames), the SHGC for the frame is invariably lower than that for the glass. Consequently, an NFRC-certified SHGC will generally be lower.

Conversely, the VT for the center-of-glass overstates the VT for the overall product (including the frame). The VT for the frame is zero. Consequently, an NFRC-certified VT will always be lower. For this reason, Exception 2 to Section 1312.2 is only applicable to Exception 1 in Section 1323. It is not applicable to other sections.

***

 1314 Air Leakage

 1314.1 ~~Building Envelope: The requirements of this section shall apply to building elements separating conditioned from unconditioned spaces. Exterior joints around windows and door frames, openings between walls and foundation, between walls and roof and wall panels; openings at penetrations of utility services through walls, floors and roofs; and all other openings in the building envelope shall be~~sealed, caulked, gasketed or weatherstripped to limit air leakage.

Building Envelope Sealing. The following areas of the building envelope shall be sealed, caulked, gasketed, or weather-stripped to minimize air leakage:  a. joints around fenestration and door frames,

 b. junctions between walls and foundations, between walls at building corners, between walls and structural floors or roofs, and between walls and roof or wall panels,

 c. openings at penetrations of utility services through roofs, walls,

 and floors,

 d. site-built fenestration and doors,

 e. building assemblies used as ducts or plenums,

 f. joints, seams, and penetrations of vapor retarders,

 g. all other openings in the building envelope.

1314.2 Glazing and Doors: Air leakage for fenestration and doors shall be determined in accordance with NFRC 400 or AAMA/WDMA/CSA101/I.S.2/A440. Air leakage shall be determined by a laboratory accredited by a nationally recognized accreditation organization, such as the National Fenestration Rating Council, and shall be labeled and certified by the manufacturer. Air leakage shall not exceed 1.0 cfm/ft2 for glazed swinging entrance doors and for revolving doors and 0.3 cfm/ft2 for all other products. ~~Doors and operable glazing separating conditioned from unconditioned space shall be weatherstripped. Fixed windows shall be tight fitting with glass retained by stops with sealant or caulking all around.~~

 EXCEPTIONS: 1. Openings that are required to be fire resistant.

2. Field-fabricated fenestration and doors that are weather- stripped or sealed in accordance with 1314.1.

3. For garage doors, air leakage determined by test at standard test conditions in accordance with ANSI/DASMA 105 shall be an acceptable alternate for compliance with air leakage requirements.

4. Units without air leakage ratings produced by small  business that are weather-stripped or sealed in accordance with 1314.1.

***

1314.5 Loading Dock Weatherseals. Cargo doors and loading dock doors shall be equipped with weatherseals to restrict infiltration when vehicles are parked in the doorway.  1314.6 Vestibules. Building entrances that separate conditioned space from the exterior shall be protected with an enclosed vestibule, with all doors opening into and out of the vestibule equipped with self- closing devices. Vestibules shall be designed so that in passing through the vestibule it is not necessary for the interior and exterior doors to open at the same time. Interior and exterior doors shall have a minimum distance between them of not less than 7 ft when in the closed position. The exterior envelope of conditioned vestibules shall comply with the requirements for a conditioned space. Either the interior or exterior envelope of unconditioned vestibules shall comply with the requirements for a conditioned space.

 EXCEPTIONS: 1. Building entrances with revolving doors.

 2. Doors not intended to be used as a building entrance.

 3. Building entrances in buildings that are less than four stories above grade and less than 10,000 ft2 in area.

 4. Doors that open directly from a space that is less than 3000 ft2 in area and is separate from the building entrance.

 ***

 1322 Opaque Envelope: Roof/ceilings, opaque exterior walls, opaque doors, floors over unconditioned space, below-grade walls, slab-on- grade floors and radiant floors enclosing conditioned spaces shall be insulated according to Section 1311 and Tables 13-1 or 13-2. Compliance with nominal R-values shall be demonstrated for the thermal resistance of the added insulation in framing cavities and/or insulated sheathing only. Nominal R-values shall not include the thermal transmittance of other building materials or air films.

 For metal frame assemblies used in spaces with electric resistance space heat, compliance shall be demonstrated with the component U-factor for the overall assembly based on the assemblies in Chapter 10.

Area-weighted averaging of the R-value is not allowed. When showing compliance with R-values, the minimum insulation R-value for all areas of the component shall comply with Table 13-1. When calculating compliance using U-factors, area-weighted averaging is allowed. Where insulation is tapered (e.g. roofs), separate assembly U-factors shall be calculated for each four-foot section of tapered insulation.

 EXCEPTIONS: 1. Opaque smoke vents are not required to meet insulation requirements.

 2. For prescriptive compliance only:

~~a. For glazing areas that are 30% and less of the gross wall area, the~~The insulation of the perimeter edge of an above grade floor slab which penetrates the exterior wall may be reduced to R-5 provided the glazing U-factor is reduced to U-0.05 below that required in Tables 13-1 and 13-2.

~~b. For glazing areas that exceed 30% of the gross wall area, the perimeter edge of an above grade floor slab which penetrates the exterior wall may be left uninsulated provided the glazing U-factor is reduced by U-0.10 below that required in Tables 13-1 and 13-2.~~

3. For roofs with continuous rigid insulation on the top of the roof, the insulation R-value may be averaged for compliance with minimum prescriptive R-values only, provided that both:  a. the minimum insulation is no less than R-5 (but not including area within 6 inches of each roof drain), and

 b. the area-weighted average insulation is R-50 (in lieu of R-30).

1323 Glazing: Glazing shall comply with Section 1312 and Tables 13-1 or 13-2. All glazing shall be, at a minimum, double glazing. In addition, all glazing assemblies shall have at least one low- emissivity coating unless the glazing assembly has an overall U- factor that complies with the values in Table 13-1.

Visible transmittance shall be determined in accordance with Section 1312.2, and,

~~b.~~ c. does not exceed 75% of the gross exterior wall area of the display side of the street level story. However, if the display side of the street level story exceeds 20 feet in height, then this exemption may only be used for the first 20 feet of that story.

 When this exception is utilized, separate calculations shall be performed for these sections of the building envelope and these values shall not be averaged with any others for compliance purposes. The 75% area may be exceeded on the street level, if the additional glass area is provided from allowances from other areas of the building.

 2. Single glazing for ornamental, security, or architectural purposes shall be included in the percentage of total glazing area, U-factor calculation and SHGC as allowed in the Tables 13-1 or 13-2. The maximum area allowed for the total of all single glazing is 1% of the gross exterior wall area.

 ***

 1323.3 Solar Heat Gain Coefficient: The area-weighted average solar heat gain coefficient of all glazing shall not be greater than that specified in Tables 13-1 or 13-2 for the appropriate area and U- factor.

EXCEPTIONS:

1. Glazing separating conditioned space from semi-heated space or unconditioned space.

 ***

 1331 General: Buildings or structures whose design heat loss rate (UAp) and solar heat gain coefficient rate (SHGC * Ap) are less than or equal to the target heat loss rate (UAt) and solar heat gain coefficient rate (SHGC * At) shall be considered in compliance with this section. The stated U-factor, F-factor or allowable area of any component assembly, listed in Tables 13-1 or 13-2, such as roof/ceiling, opaque wall, opaque door, glazing, floor over conditioned space, slab on grade floor, radiant floor or opaque floor may be increased and the U-factor or F-factor for other components decreased, provided that the total heat gain or loss for the entire building envelope does not exceed the total resulting from compliance to the U-factors, F-factors or allowable areas specified in this section.

EXCEPTIONS:

1. Compliance is also allowed to be shown using RS-32.

2. The prescriptive approach in Section 1323 may be used for that portion of the building envelope that complies with Exception 1 to Section 1323.

***

 1333 UA Calculations: The target UAt and the proposed UAp shall be calculated using Equations 13-1 and 13-2 and the corresponding areas and U-factors from Table 13-1 or 13-2.

Non-standard Part Load Value (NPLV) is defined as single number part-load efficiency figure of merit for chillers references to conditions other than IPLV conditions. Design condenser water flow rate shall not be less than 2.5 gpm/ton.

Equipment not listed in Tables 14-1A to 14-1G is allowed to be used.

***

1412.9 Enclosed Parking Garage Ventilation. See the Seattle Mechanical Code, Section 404 for requirements for controls for parking garage ventilation.

***

 1413.1 Operation: Air economizers shall be capable of automatically modulating outside and return air dampers to provide 100% of the

 design supply air as outside air to reduce or eliminate the need for mechanical cooling. Air economizers shall be used for RS-29 analysis base case for all systems without exceptions in Sections 1413, 1423, or 1433. Water economizers, when allowed by Section 1132.2  exception 1 or Section 1433 exception 9,

 shall be capable of providing the total concurrent cooling load served by the connected terminal equipment lacking airside economizer, at outside air temperatures of 45?F dry-bulb/40?F wet-bulb and below. For this calculation, all factors including solar and internal load shall be the same as those used for peak load calculations, except for the outside temperatures.

~~EXCEPTION: Water economizers using air-cooled heat rejection equipment may use a 35?F dry-bulb outside air temperature for this~~calculation. This exception is limited to a maximum of 20 tons per

 building.

 Note that this requirement will result in a larger cooling tower.

 ***

1413.5 Economizer Heating System Impact: Any HVAC system that increases the building heating energy use during economizer operation is not allowed (e.g. single-fan/dual-duct systems and multizone systems).

EXCEPTIONS:

1. Where the heating is allowed by Section 1435.

2. Water source heat pump systems that comply with Section 1433, Exception 2.

 Note that single-fan/dual-duct systems and multizone systems do not comply with this requirement. This is because economizer operation lowers the temperature of the air entering the hot deck heating coil, increasing its energy use. In order to use this type of system, the system must meet one of the economizer exceptions and have neither type of economizer. (Another resolution is to use a dual-fan/dual-duct system where the hot deck fan supplies only return air or return air plus minimum ventilation air.)  This requirement will not affect three-deck multizone since they cannot work with an air economizer in any case (it would make the neutral deck a cold deck).

 An exception to the heating impact is provided for economizers on VAV systems that cause zone level heating to increase due to a reduction in supply air temperature. Reducing supply air temperatures on a cooling-VAV system will reduce fan energy (particularly if the system has a variable speed drive), offsetting the energy lost due to increased reheat energy.

 See the discussion and diagrams of Section 6.5.1.4 of ASHRAE/IESNA Standard 90.1 in the Users Manual.

 ***

 1414.1 Sealing: Duct work which is designed to operate at pressures above 1/2 inch water column static pressure shall be sealed ~~in accordance with Standard RS-18. Extent of sealing required is~~as follows:

 1. ~~Static pressure: 1/2 inch to 2 inches; seal transverse joints.~~(Reserved.)

 2. Static pressure: ~~2~~1/2 inches to 3 inches; seal all transverse joints and longitudinal seams. Spiral lock seams in round and flat oval ductwork do not require sealing, however, other seams shall be sealed.

 3. Static pressure: above 3 inches; seal all transverse joints, longitudinal seams and duct wall penetrations.

~~Duct tape and other pressure sensitive tape shall not be used as the primary sealant where ducts are designed to operate at static pressures of 1 inch W.C. or greater.~~

All low-pressure supply and return air systems not located entirely within the conditioned space, including the unconditioned side of enclosed stud bays or joist cavities/spaces used to transport air, shall be securely fastened and sealed. Ductwork shall be sealed using welds, gaskets, mastic, or mastic-plus-embedded-fabric tape. Enclosed stud bays or joist cavities/spaces used to transport air shall be sealed using mastic-plus-embedded-fabric tape or, when drywall is used to enclose the air system, drywall mud and tape. Duct tape is not permitted as a sealant on any ducts.

EXCEPTION: Fibrous glass duct systems installed in accordance with standard UL 181A and flexible duct systems installed in accordance with standard UL 181B may use tapes listed for these systems.

Note that longitudinal seams are joints oriented in the direction of airflow. Transverse joints are connections of two duct sections oriented perpendicular to airflow. Duct wall penetrations are openings made by any screw fastener, pipe, rod or wire. All other connections are considered transverse joints, including but not limited to spin-ins, taps and other branch connections, access door frames and jambs, duct connections to equipment.

 1414.2 Insulation: Ducts and plenums that are constructed and function as part of the building envelope, by separating interior space from exterior space, shall meet all applicable requirements of Chapter 13. These requirements include insulation installation, moisture control, air leakage, and building envelope insulation

 levels. ~~Unheated equipment rooms with combustion air louvers shall be isolated from the conditioned space by insulating interior surfaces to a minimum of R 11 and any exterior envelope surfaces per Chapter 13.~~ Outside air ducts serving individual supply air units with less than 2,800 cfm of total supply air capacity shall be insulated to a minimum of R-7 and are not considered building envelope.

That portion of the equipment serving Group R occupancy is not included in determining the total capacity of all units without economizers in a building.~~

 ***

1431.2 System Sizing Limits: Heating and cooling design loads for the purpose of sizing systems shall be determined in accordance with one of the procedures described in Chapter 29 of Standard RS-1 listed in Chapter 7 or an equivalent computation procedure. For interior temperatures, 70 degrees F shall be used for heating and 75 degrees F for cooling, except where different values are specified in the Washington Administrative Code (WAC). For exterior temperatures, 24 degrees F shall be used for heating and 82 degrees F dry bulb and 66 degrees F for wet bulb for cooling.

Building mechanical systems for all buildings which provide space heating and/or space cooling shall be sized no greater than 150% of the design load as calculated above, except that cooling towers shall comply with the sizing requirements in Section 1411.1. No additional safety factor is allowed.

For buildings with a total equipment cooling capacity of 300 tons and above, the equipment shall comply with one of the following: (1) no one unit shall have a cooling capacity of more than 2/3 of the total installed cooling equipment capacity; (2) the equipment shall have a variable speed drive; or (3) the equipment shall have multiple compressors.~~~~EXCEPTIONS: The following limited exemptions from the sizing limit shall be allowed, however, in all cases heating and/or cooling design load calculations shall be submitted.

***

 1433 Economizers: Air economizers meeting the requirements of Section 1413 shall be provided on all new systems including those serving computer server rooms, electronic equipment, radio equipment, telephone switchgear.

 EXCEPTIONS: 1. Qualifying small equipment: This exception shall not be used for unitary cooling equipment installed outdoors or in a mechanical room adjacent to the outdoors. This exception is allowed to be used for other cooling units and split systems with a total cooling capacity rated in accordance with 1411.2 of less than 33,000 Btu/h (hereafter referred to as qualifying small systems) provided that these are ~~High~~high-efficiency cooling ~~units~~ equipment with SEER and EER values more than ~~10%~~15% higher than minimum efficiencies listed in Tables 14-1A, 14-1B and 14-1D, in the appropriate size category, using the same test procedures. The total capacity of all ~~systems~~qualifying small equipment without economizers shall not exceed ~~480,000~~72,000 Btu/h per building, or ~~20%~~5% of its air economizer capacity, whichever is greater. That portion of the equipment serving Group R Occupancy is not included in determining the total capacity of all units without economizers in a building. Redundant units are not counted in the capacity limitations. This exception shall not be used for RS-29 analysis~~nor include unitary cooling equipment installed outdoors nor in a mechanical room adjacent to outdoors~~.

Note: Exception 1 is only applicable to HVAC equipment that complies with Section 1411.1 and is regulated in Tables 14-1A, 14-1B  and 14-1D.

 - Section 1411.1 requires that "If a nationally recognized certification program exists for a product covered in Tables 14-1A through 14-1G, and it includes provisions for verification and challenge of equipment efficiency ratings, then the product shall be listed in the certification program." As the ARI program does

 satisfy those criteria, products subject to the ARI standards must be listed in the ARI Certification Program.

 - In Tables 14-1A, 14-1B, and 14-1D, virtually all of the equipment efficiency ratings are required to be determined in accordance with an ARI standard. Energy Code compliance is determined at standard conditions (not at project specific conditions). Compliance should be verifiable through the ARI directory at www.aridirectory.org. It is not acceptable for a manufacturer to submit their own calculations for ARI standards.

 - Consequently, to use Exception 1 to Section 1433, a product must both: be within the scope of the specified ARI standard and be included in the ARI certification program. Certain equipment used in computer server rooms is not within the scope of the standards listed in Tables 14-1A, 14-1B, and 14-1D and is not eligible for certification. Therefore, such equipment does not qualify to use Exception 1 to Section 1433 (though it may qualify to use another exception).

 2. Chilled water terminal units connected to systems with chilled water generation equipment with ~~COP and~~ IPLV or NPLV values more than 10% higher than minimum efficiencies listed in Table 14-1C, 14-1K, 14-1L or 14-1M, in the appropriate size category, using the same test procedures. The total capacity of all systems without economizers shall not exceed ~~480,000~~72,000 Btu/h per building, or ~~20%~~5% of its air economizer capacity, whichever is greater. That portion of the equipment serving Group R Occupancy is not included in determining the total capacity of all units without economizers in a building. This exception shall not be used for RS-29 analysis.

 3. ~~Water-cooled refrigeration equipment provided with a water economizer meeting the requirements of Section 1413. Water economizer capacity per building shall not exceed 500 tons. This exception shall not be used for RS-29 analysis.~~ Reserved.

4. Systems for which at least 75% of the annual energy used for mechanical cooling is provided from site-recovery or site-solar energy source.

 5. Systems where special outside air filtration and treatment, for the reduction and treatment of unusual outdoor contaminants, makes an air economizer infeasible.

 6. Systems with dehumidification that affect other systems

~~(such as dehumidification and supermarket refrigeration systems)~~ so as to increase the overall building energy consumption. New

 humidification equipment shall comply with Section 1413.4.

 7. Systems complying with all of the following criteria:

 a. Consist of multiple water source heat pumps with a total cooling capacity for each water-source heat pump of less than 54,000 Btu/h that are connected to a common water loop;

 b. Have a minimum of 60% air economizer complying with Section 1413 that is ducted in a fully enclosed path directly to every heat pump unit in each zone, except that ducts may terminate within 12 inches of the intake to an HVAC unit provided that they are physically fastened so that the outside air duct is directed into the unit intake;

 c. Have water source heat pumps with an EER at least 15% higher for cooling and, for units serving perimeter zones with heating loads (e.g. zones with exterior walls, roofs, or floors), a COP at least 15% higher for heating than that specified in Section 1411;

 d. Where provided with a dedicated boiler or furnace for that building, have a central boiler or furnace efficiency of:

 i. 90% minimum for units up to 199,000 Btu/h; and

 ii. 85% minimum for units above 199,000 Btu/h input; and

 e. Provide heat recovery with a minimum 50% heat recovery effectiveness as defined in Section 1436 to preheat the outside air supply.

 8. For Group R Occupancy, cooling units installed outdoors or in a mechanical room adjacent to outdoors with a total cooling capacity less than 20,000 Btu/h and other cooling units with a total cooling capacity less than 54,000 Btu/h.

9. Equipment used to cool any dedicated server room, electronic equipment room or telecom switch room provided that they completely comply with option a or option b or option c or option d in the table below. This exception shall not be used for RS-29 analysis.  Equipment Type Higher Equipment Part-load Economizer Efficiency Control

Notes to Exception 9.

a. For a system where all of cooling equipment is subject to the ARI standards listed in Table 14-1A and Table 14-1B, the system shall comply with all of the following (note that if the system contains any cooling equipment that exceeds the capacity limits in Table14-1A or Table 14-1B, or if the system contains any cooling equipment that is not included in Table14-1A or Table 14-1B, then system is not allowed to use this option).

c. For units with a total cooling capacity over 85,000 Btuh, the system shall utilize part-load capacity control schemes that are able to modulate to a part-load capacity of 50% of the load or less that results in the compressor operating at the same or higher EER at part loads than at full load (e.g. minimum of two-stages of compressor unloading such as cylinder unloading, two-stage scrolls, dual tandem scrolls, but hot gas bypass is not credited as a compressor unloading system).

d. The cooling equipment shall have an EER value and an IPLV value that is a minimum of 5% greater than the value listed in Table 14-1A and Table 14-1B (1.05 x values in Tables 14-1A and 14-1B).

Water economizers shall be capable of providing the total concurrent cooling load served by the connected terminal equipment lacking airside economizer, at outside air temperatures of 45?F dry-bulb/40?F wet-bulb and below. For this calculation, all factors including solar and internal load shall be the same as those used for peak load calculations, except for the outside temperatures. The equipment shall be served by a dedicated condenser water system unless a non-dedicated condenser water system exists that can provide appropriate water temperatures during hours when waterside economizer cooling is available.

h. The chiller shall utilize part-load capacity control schemes that are able to modulate to a part-load capacity of 50% of the load or less that results in the compressor operating at the same or higher EER at part loads than at full load (e.g. minimum of two- stages of compressor unloading such as cylinder unloading, two-stage scrolls, dual tandem scrolls, but hot gas bypass is not credited as a compressor unloading system).

i. For a system where all of cooling equipment is subject to ASHRAE Standard 127-2001.

j. The cooling equipment subject to the ASHRAE Standard 127-2001 shall have an EER value and an IPLV value that is equal or greater than the value listed in Table 14-1A and Table 14-1B when determined in accordance with the rating conditions ASHRAE Standard 127-2001 (i.e. not the rating conditions in ARI Standard 210/240 or 340/360).

Note: Exception 9, options 9a and 9b are only applicable to HVAC equipment that complies with Section 1411.1 and is regulated in Tables 14-1A and 14-1B.  - Section 1411.1 requires that "If a nationally recognized certification program exists for a product covered in Tables 14-1A through 14-1G, and it includes provisions for verification and challenge of equipment efficiency ratings, then the product shall be listed in the certification program." As the ARI program does satisfy those criteria, products subject to the ARI standards must be listed in the ARI Certification Program.

 - In Tables 14-1A and 14-1B, virtually all of the equipment

 efficiency ratings are required to be determined in accordance with an ARI standard. Energy Code compliance is determined at standard conditions (not at project specific conditions). Compliance should be verifiable through the ARI directory at www.aridirectory.org. It is not acceptable for a manufacturer to submit their own calculations for ARI standards.

 - Consequently, to use Exception 9 options 9a and 9b to Section 1433, a product must both: be within the scope of the specified ARI

 standard and be included in the ARI certification program. Certain equipment used in computer server rooms is not within the scope of the standards listed in Tables 14-1A and 14-1B and is not eligible for certification. Therefore, such equipment does not qualify to use Exception 9 options 9a and 9b to Section 1433.

 - Certain equipment used in computer server rooms is not within the scope of the standards listed in Tables 14-1A and 14-1B, but is within the scope of ASHRAE Standard 127, Method of Testing for Rating Computer and Data Processing Room Unitary Air Conditioners. This equipment is eligible to use Exception 9 option 9d to Section 1433.

 Note: For hydronic systems over 300,000 Btuh, see Section 1432.2.2.

 ***

 1435 Simultaneous Heating and Cooling: Systems which provide heating and cooling simultaneously to a zone are prohibited. Zone thermostatic and humidistatic controls shall be capable of operating in sequence the supply of heating and cooling energy to the zone. Such controls shall prevent:

For multiple zone systems, each zone need not comply with this exception provided the average of all zones served by the system that have both heating and cooling ability comply.

 c. 300 cfm. This exception is for zones whose peak flow rate totals no more than 10% of the total fan system flow rate.

 d. Any higher rate that can be demonstrated, to the satisfaction of the building official, to reduce overall system annual energy usage by offsetting reheat/recool energy losses through a reduction in outdoor air intake in accordance with the multiple space requirements defined in ASHRAE Standard 62.

 2. Zones where special pressurization relationships, cross- contamination requirements, or code required minimum circulation rates are such that variable air volume systems are impractical.

 3. Zones where at least 75% of the energy for reheating or for providing warm air in mixing systems is provided from a site- recovered (including condenser heat) or site-solar energy source.

 4. Zones where specific humidity levels are required to satisfy process needs, such as computer rooms, museums, surgical suites, and buildings with refrigerating systems, such as supermarkets, refrigerated warehouses, and ice arenas.

.

1513.3.1 Separate Control: Daylight zones shall have controls which control the lights independent of general area lighting.

 Contiguous daylight zones adjacent to vertical glazing are allowed to be controlled by a single controlling device provided that they do not include zones facing more than two adjacent cardinal orientations (i.e. north, east, south, west). Daylight zones under overhead glazing more than 15 feet from the perimeter shall be controlled separately from daylight zones adjacent to vertical glazing. For daylight zones under overhead glazing that exceed 5,000 square feet, there must be at least two independent photocontrol systems with each system having a dedicated photosensor.

 EXCEPTION: Daylight spaces enclosed by walls or ceiling height partitions and containing 2 or fewer lighting fixtures are not required to have a separate switch for general area lighting.

1513.3.2 Automatic Control: Daylight zones shall have controls which automatically reduce lighting power in response to available daylight by either:  a. a combination of dimming ballasts and daylight-sensing automatic controls, which are capable of dimming the lights continuously, or

 b. a combination of stepped switching and daylight-sensing automatic controls, which are capable of incrementally reducing the light level in steps automatically and turning the lights off automatically.

i.

As an alternate, where the daylight zone contains two rows of luminaires and they are parallel to a window, three levels of automatic control may also be achieved by having both rows on, the row closest to the window off and the other row on, and both rows off. For rooms, such as small offices, which contain only a single one-lamp luminaire, it is acceptable for the daylighting control system to automatically switch off the entire luminaire.

ii. Two-lamp luminaires shall have three levels of automatic control: both lamps on, one lamp on and one lamp off, and both lamps off. As an alternate, where the daylight zone contains two rows of luminaires and they are parallel to a window, three levels of automatic control may also be achieved by having both rows on, the row closest to the window off and the other row on, and both rows off. For rooms, such as small offices, which contain only a single two-lamp luminaire, it is acceptable for the daylighting control system to automatically switch off the entire luminaire rather than switching off one lamp, then both lamps.

iii. Three-lamp luminaires shall have four levels of automatic control: all three lamps on, two lamps on and one lamp off, one lamp on and two lamps off, and all three lamps off.

iv. For other multi-lamp luminaries with four or more lamps, the number of required incremental steps shall be equal to one plus the number of lamps in the luminaire.  Any switching devices installed to override the automatic daylighting control shall comply with the criteria in Section 1513.6.2a-e.

 3.3 Envelope

 3.3.1 Insulation and Glazing: Glazing area and U-factor of the standard building envelope shall be determined by using the Target UA requirements of Equation 13-1 and U-factor values in Table 13-1 or 13-2. The glazing solar heat gain coefficient (SHGC) of the standard building shall be the lesser of 0.65 and the SHGC required by Table 13-1 or 13-2 for the vertical or overhead glazing area for the appropriate wall type. The opaque area U-factors of the standard building shall be determined by using the Target UA requirements from Equation 13-1~~including the appropriate mass for walls~~, except that the walls in the standard design shall be metal stud walls. The insulation characteristics and glazing area are prescribed assumptions for the standard building for calculating the standard energy consumption. In the calculation of the proposed energy consumption of the proposed design, the envelope characteristics of the proposed design shall be used. The standard design shall use the lesser of the glazing area of the proposed design or the maximum glazing areas listed in Tables 13-1 or 13-2 for the appropriate use. The distribution of vertical glazing in the gross wall area of the standard design shall be equal to the distribution of vertical glazing in the proposed design or shall constitute an equal percentage of gross wall area on all sides of the standard building. The distribution of overhead glazing in the gross roof/ceiling area of the standard design shall be equal to the distribution of overhead glazing in the proposed design. The distribution of doors in the gross opaque wall area of the standard design shall be identical to the distribution of doors in the proposed design.

 3.3.2 Infiltration: For standard and proposed buildings, infiltration assumptions shall be equal.

 3.3.3 Envelope and Ground Absorptivities: For the standard building, absorptivity assumptions shall be default assumptions for computing the standard energy consumption and default assumptions for computing the proposed energy consumption.

 3.3.4 Window Treatment: No draperies or blinds shall be modeled for the standard or proposed building.

 3.3.5 Shading: For standard building and the proposed design, shading by permanent structures and terrain shall be taken into account for computing energy consumption whether or not these features are located on the building site. A permanent fixture is one that is likely to remain for the life of the proposed design. Credit may be taken for external shading devices that are part of the proposed design.

 3.4 HVAC Systems and Equipment: For the standard building, the HVAC system used shall be the system type used in the proposed design. If

 the proposed HVAC system type does not comply with Sections 1432 through 1439 the standard design system shall comply in all respects with those sections.

 2. Thermally similar zones, such as those facing one orientation on different floors, may be grouped together for the purposes of either the standard or proposed building simulation.

 3.4.2 Process Equipment Sizing: Process sensible and latent loads shall be equal in calculating both the standard energy consumption and the proposed energy consumption. The designer shall document the installation of process equipment and the size of process loads.

 3.4.3 HVAC Equipment Sizing: The equipment shall be sized to include the capacity to meet the process loads. For calculating the proposed energy consumption, actual air flow rates and installed equipment size shall be used in the simulation. Equipment sizing in the simulation of the proposed design shall correspond to the equipment intended to be selected for the design and the designer shall not use equipment sized automatically by the simulation tool.

 Equipment sizing for the standard design shall be based on the same as the proposed design or lesser sizing ratio of installed system capacity to the design load for heating and for cooling.

 Chilled water systems for the standard building shall be modeled using a reciprocating chiller for systems with total cooling capacities less than 175 tons, and centrifugal chillers for systems with cooling capacities of 175 tons or greater. For systems with cooling capacities of 600 tons or more, the standard energy consumption shall be calculated using two centrifugal chillers, lead/lag controlled. Chilled water shall be assumed to be controlled at a constant 44?F temperature rise, from 44?F to 56?F, operating at 65 % combined impeller and motor efficiency.

 Numbered Footnotes for Table 3-3

 HVAC System Descriptions for Prototype Buildings

 1. The systems and energy types presented in this Table are not intended as requirements or recommendations for the proposed design.

 2. For occupancies such as restaurants, assembly and retail that are

 part of a mixed use building which, according to Table 3-3, includes a central chilled water plant (systems 3, 5, or 6), chilled water system type 3 or 5 shall be used as indicated in the table.

 3. Constant volume may be used in zones where pressurization relationships must be maintained by code. Where constant volume is used, the system shall have heat recovery if required by Section 1436. VAV shall be used in all other areas, in accordance with Sections 1432 through 1439.

 4. Provide run-around heat recovery systems for all fan systems with a minimum outside air intake greater than 70%. Recovery effectiveness shall be 0.50.

 5. If a warehouse is not intended to be mechanically cooled, both the standard and proposed designs shall be calculated assuming no mechanical cooling.

 6. The system listed is for guest rooms only. Areas such as public areas and back-of-house areas shall be served by system 4. Other areas such as offices and retail shall be served by systems listed in Table 3-3 for these occupancy types.

 7. The system listed is for guest rooms only. Areas such as public areas and back-of- house areas shall be served by system 5. Other areas such as offices and retail shall be served by systems listed in Table 3-3 for these occupancy types.

 8. Reserved.

 9. Reserved.

 10. Design supply air circulation rate shall be based on a supply-air to room-air temperature difference of 20?F. A higher supply-air temperature may be used if required to maintain a minimum circulation rate of 4.5 air changes per hour or 15 cfm per person to each zone served by the system, at design conditions. If return fans are specified, they shall be sized for the supply fan capacity less the required minimum ventilation with outside air, or 75% of the supply fan capacity, whichever is larger. Except where noted, supply and return fans shall be operated continuously during occupied hours.

 11. Fan energy when included in the efficiency rating of the unit as defined in Section 1411, need not be modeled explicitly for this system. The fan shall cycle with calls for heating or cooling.

 12. Chilled water systems shall be modeled using a reciprocating chiller for systems with total cooling capacities less than 175 tons, and centrifugal chillers for systems with cooling capacities of 175 tons or greater. For systems with cooling capacities of 600 tons or more, the standard design energy consumption shall be calculated using two centrifugal chillers, lead/lag controlled. Chilled water shall be assumed to be controlled at a constant 44?F. Chiller water pumps shall be sized using a 12?F temperature rise, from 44?F to 56?F, operating at 65% combined impeller and motor efficiency. Condenser water pumps shall be sized using a 10?F temperature rise, operating at 60% combined impeller and motor efficiency. The cooling tower shall be an open circuit, centrifugal blower type sized for the larger of 85?F leaving water temperature or 10?F approach to design wetbulb temperature. The tower shall be controlled to provide a 65?F leaving water temperature whenever weather conditions permit, floating up to design leaving water temperatures at design conditions. Chilled water supply temperature shall be reset in accordance with Section 1432.2.2.

 13. Hot water system shall include a natural draft fossil fuel or electric boiler. The hot water pump shall be sized based on a 30?F temperature drop, from 180?F to 150?F, operating at a combined impeller and motor efficiency of 60%. Hot water supply temperature shall be reset in accordance with Section 1432.2.2.
