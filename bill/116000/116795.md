 Version #1 Attachment 1:

 AMENDMENT TO CONCESSION AGREEMENT

 This Amendment to the February 2, 2009, Concession Agreement by and between THE CITY OF SEATTLE ("City") and ARENA SPORTS MAGNUSON PARK, LLC, a Washington limited liability company ("Concessionaire"), is effective as of ____________, 2010 (the "Effective Date").

 Agreement

 In consideration of the mutual promises contained herein, the parties hereby agree to amend the Agreement as follows:

 1. Exhibits. Subsection 1.8 of the Agreement is amended to include a new Exhibit F, as indicated below:

 1.8 Exhibits. The following exhibits are made a part of this Agreement:

 Exhibit A - USA Deed

 Exhibit B - Legal Description

 Exhibit C - Parking Area Depiction

 Exhibit D - Public Benefit Requirements

 Exhibit E - Initial Alterations Plan

 Exhibit F - Floor Plan with Access Towers

 2. Term. Section 3 of the Agreement is amended as indicated below:

 3.1 Term. This Agreement shall commence on the Effective Date and terminate forty (40) years after the Rent Commencement Date, unless the Agreement is terminated earlier as provided herein. Concessionaire shall have exclusive access to the Premises commencing on the Possession Date in order for Concessionaire to design and construct the Initial Alterations.

 3.2 [Reserved].

 3.3 City's Right to Terminate. Commencing on the tenth (10th) anniversary of the Rent Commencement Date, the City shall have an option to terminate this Agreement if Concessionaire fails to fully renovate and occupy the northwest and southwest access towers located within the Premises and depicted on Exhibit F hereto, in accordance with all applicable building code and historic preservation requirements. The City may exercise its termination option by delivering written notice to Concessionaire specifying the effective termination date which shall in no event be less than two (2) years from the date of said notice. If the City exercises such option, the City shall pay Concessionaire the amount of its eligible capital expenditures for the Premises to the extent not previously offset, and Concessionaire shall no longer be entitled to any Capital Improvement Rental Offset under this Agreement. Thereafter, this Agreement shall continue in effect until the effective termination date subject to earlier termination by Concessionaire upon thirty (30) days' written notice to the City.

 3. Capital Improvement Rental Offset. Subsection 4.3 of the Agreement is amended as indicated below:

 4.3 Capital Improvement Rental Offset. Except as provided below with respect to expenditures eligible for Federal rehabilitation tax credits, throughout the Term, Concessionaire shall be entitled to apply as an offset against up to 77% of each monthly Base Rent payment, the actual remaining unamortized costs incurred by Concessionaire and directly related to the design, permitting and construction of the Initial Alterations and any subsequent capital improvements to the Premises approved by the Superintendent pursuant to Section 11, below. These costs may include hard and soft costs such as, but not limited to, labor, materials, architecture and engineering fees, permits, licensing fees, equipment costs or rental fees, construction or project management fees, sales tax, and consultants' fees, but shall not include interest on construction financing. Prior to commencement of construction of the Initial Alterations or subsequent capital improvement to the Premises, Concessionaire shall submit to the Superintendent a budget for the same (the "Construction Budget"). Within thirty (30) days after receipt of the Construction Budget, the Superintendent, in his or her reasonable discretion, shall certify the total amount of construction costs of the Initial Alterations (or subsequent capital improvement to the Premises) that the Superintendent approves as eligible for Concessionaire's Capital Improvement Rental Offset. Not later than six (6) months after Concessionaire receives a certificate of occupancy for the Initial Alterations (and upon final completion of any later Superintendent-approved capital improvement), Concessionaire shall provide the Superintendent with an accounting of its actual costs associated with the capital improvements completed to the Premises, together with such supporting documentation as the Superintendent may reasonably request. The Superintendent, in his or her reasonable discretion, shall certify the final amount of costs incurred by Concessionaire in connection with such improvements and this amount shall constitute the amount of Concessionaire's Capital Improvement Rental Offset.

 Each month throughout the Term, Concessionaire shall report to the Parks Finance Director, or his or her designee, the dollar amount of Capital Improvement Rental Offset it is applying to such Base Rent. If the aggregate amount of capital expenditures subject to the Capital Improvement Rental Offset exceeds the total Base Rent payable under this Agreement during the Term, Concessionaire shall not have any right to recover from the City the balance. Unless the Superintendent agrees otherwise, upon the termination or expiration of this Agreement any remaining balance shall be deemed to be donated to the City, and the improvements shall be surrendered with the Premises in accordance with Sections 11.4 and 14.

 The parties anticipate that Concessionaire will be applying for Federal historic rehabilitation tax credits pursuant to Internal Revenue Code Section 47 ("Rehabilitation Tax Credit") as part of its financing for the Initial Alterations. If Concessionaire receives any Rehabilitation Tax Credit, then the aggregate amount of costs of the Initial Alterations that Tenant may apply against Base Rent pursuant to this Section 4.3 shall be reduced by an amount equal to seventy- five percent (75%) of the net amount of the Rehabilitation Tax Credit less costs incurred by Tenant in connection with its application and processing necessary to obtain the Rehabilitation Tax Credit. For purposes of illustration, if the costs of the Initial Alterations is $700,000.00, the amount of the Rehabilitation Tax Credit is $110,000.00 and Tenant incurs costs of $10,000.00 in connection with its application for the Rehabilitation Tax Credit, Tenant may apply up to $625,000.00 against Base Rent in accordance with this Section 4.3, calculated as follows: $700,000.00 - 75% ($110,000.00 - $10,000.00).

 4. High Capacity Events. Subsection 8.2 of the Agreement is amended, as indicated below:

 8.2 High Capacity Events. Magnuson Park has limited capacity to handle multiple events with large numbers of attendees. Therefore, if the Concessionaire reasonably anticipates that more than 500 people will attend any event on the Premises at the same time, the Concessionaire shall provide the City with no less than thirty (30) days advance written notice. If the City determines that the event would conflict with other high capacity events that have already been scheduled to take place at the same time, the City shall notify the Concessionaire within five (5) business days after receipt of the Concessionaire's notice. Upon receipt of such notice, the Concessionaire must either reschedule the event or reduce the size of the event to less than 500 attendees.

 5. Conflict. In the event of any conflict between the terms of this Amendment and the terms of the Agreement, the provisions of this Amendment shall control.

 6. No Other Modification. Except as modified by this Amendment, the Agreement remains in full force and effect.

 7. Counterparts. This Amendment may be executed in two or more counterparts, each of which shall be deemed to be an original and all of which shall constitute part of a single Amendment.

 8. Facsimile Signatures. Each party hereto, and their respective successors and assigns, shall be authorized to rely upon the signatures of all of the parties hereto on this Amendment that are delivered by facsimile as constituting a duly authorized, irrevocable, actual, current delivery of this Amendment.

 IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the parties hereto have affixed or caused to be affixed their respective signatures with the intent to be bound by the terms hereof as of the Effective Date.
