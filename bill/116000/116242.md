 AN ORDINANCE relating to regular property taxes; providing for the submission to the qualified electors of the City at an election to be held on November 4, 2008, of a proposition authorizing the City to levy regular property taxes in excess of the limitation on levies in Chapter 84.55 RCW for the purpose of renovating the Pike Place Market and its environs; authorizing the Executive to enter into an agreement with the Pike Place Market Preservation and Development Authority; creating a new fund in the City Treasury; providing for interim financing pending tax receipts; and ratifying and confirming certain prior acts.

 WHEREAS, the Pike Place Market has been a treasured landmark since it was founded by the City of Seattle in 1907, and is currently home to more than 250 businesses, 200 crafts vendors, 100 farmers, 500 residents, and has nearly 10 million visitors each year; and

 WHEREAS, in 1973 the City of Seattle established the Pike Place Market Preservation and Development Authority (PDA) to own and manage the properties of the Pike Place Market with the objective of preserving its historic qualities, assuring its economic vitality, and promoting good management and harmonious relationships among Market users; and

 WHEREAS, the PDA owns 85% of the property in the Pike Place Market Historic District, which includes many buildings that are more than 100 years old that have not had substantial renovation for nearly 30 years; and

 WHEREAS, the Pike Place Market is in need of major repairs to, and replacement of, its basic infrastructure, including plumbing, mechanical and electrical systems, roofs, windows, floors, building facades, and seismic and fire safety systems; and

 WHEREAS, in 2003, the PDA formed a Citizens Advisory Committee to evaluate the Market's capital needs, and options for funding and financing such needs, and this Citizens Advisory Committee, over the past five years, studied and evaluated the Market's operations, capital programs and various methods of funding such needs; and

 WHEREAS, in 2006 the PDA began an in-depth analysis of its facilities to identify necessary capital improvements to improve accessibility, operational efficiency, and customer service, decrease annual repair costs, and preserve the Market's historic integrity and traditional uses; and

 WHEREAS, in November 2006 a Renovation Committee of the PDA Council was established to review the analysis and oversee and monitor the further development of the Market's renovation plan; and

 WHEREAS, a schematic design report dated October 19, 2007 identified priorities for renovation of Pike Place Market facilities totaling $80 million, and on November 27, 2007 the PDA Council affirmed its commitment and agreed to the plan's further evaluation and development; and

 WHEREAS, from November 2007 to May 2008, the PDA conducted public meetings with Seattle citizens and Market community members and completed both tenant and customer surveys to collect opinions on the plan's proposals; and

 WHEREAS, on April 29, 2008 the PDA Council adopted a revised schematic design report, which incorporated public input and identified $68.6 million in basic infrastructure improvements and $8 million in additional improvements to public and retail spaces; and

 WHEREAS, the PDA has requested that the City place before the voters, on the November 2008 ballot, the question whether to levy property taxes to pay for and finance basic infrastructure improvements at the Market; and

 WHEREAS, the City has supported the PDA in its renovation effort by authorizing the PDA to use the General Contractor/Construction Manager alternative contracting procedure under the City's authority through Resolution 30989, and by dedicating City parking revenues from PDA operated parking lots in the vicinity of Pike Place Market to planning efforts for the Market renovation through Ordinance 122562; and

 WHEREAS, current and future citizens of Seattle will reap the benefits of the basic infrastructure improvements made to the Pike Place Market to preserve its existence and traditional use for many years into the future; NOW, THEREFORE,

 Section 2. Levy of Additional Regular Property Taxes - Submittal. The City hereby submits to the qualified electors of the City a proposition as authorized by RCW 84.55.050 to exceed the levy limitation on regular property taxes contained in RCW 84.55.010 for property taxes levied in 2008 through 2013 for collection in 2009 through 2014, respectively, raising up to Seventy-three Million Dollars ($73,000,000) in aggregate over a period of up to six (6) years. The proposition shall be limited so that the City shall not levy more than Twelve Million Five Hundred Thousand Dollars ($12,500,000) additional taxes each year. All the Levy Proceeds shall be used to pay or finance the cost of major repairs to, replacement of, and additions to infrastructure such as plumbing, mechanical and electrical systems, roofs, elevators, windows, floors, building facades, restrooms, and seismic and fire safety systems at Pike Place Market. The taxes authorized by this proposition will be in addition to the maximum amount of regular property taxes the City would have been limited to by RCW 84.55.010 in the absence of voter approval under this ordinance, plus other authorized lid lifts. Pursuant to RCW 84.55.050(5), the maximum regular property taxes that may be levied in 2014 for collection in 2015 and in later years shall be computed as if the limit on regular property taxes had not been increased under this ordinance.

 Section 3. Agreement. If the voters approve the levy as provided herein, the Mayor is authorized to execute, on behalf of the City, an Agreement regarding Levy Proceeds by and between the City of Seattle and the Pike Place Market Preservation and Development Authority, substantially in the form contained in Attachment 1, hereto.

 Section 4. Deposit of Levy Proceeds. If the voters approve the levy as provided herein, all Levy Proceeds shall be placed in and segregated within the Pike Place Market Renovation Fund hereby created in the City Treasury. The Levy Proceeds may be temporarily deposited or invested in such manner as may be lawful for the investment of City money and all investment earnings shall be deposited in the Pike Place Market Renovation Fund.

 Section 5. Use of Levy Proceeds. The Levy Proceeds shall be used solely for the purposes approved by the voters in accordance with RCW 84.55.050. Up to Sixty-Eight Million, Six Hundred Thousand Dollars ($68,600,000) of the additional taxes authorized under this ordinance shall be used to pay or finance costs of the Core Market Infrastructure Projects, as more fully described in Exhibit B to Attachment 1, and to the extent permitted under the Agreement, to pay or finance costs of all or a portion of the Supplemental Market Infrastructure Projects, as more fully described in Exhibit C to Attachment 1, or to pay or finance costs of an infrastructure project substituted by City Council under Section 7. Up to Four Million Four Hundred Thousand Dollars ($4,400,000) of the additional taxes authorized under this ordinance shall be used for the purpose of providing construction financing known as City Financing as more fully described in Attachment 2.

 Section 7. Alterations, Deletions, and Additions to PDA's Market Infrastructure Projects.

 A. The City intends that the PDA will construct all Core Market Infrastructure Projects shown in Exhibit B to Attachment 1 using Levy Proceeds and other funds that may become available. If, however, the City determines in an ordinance passed by a two-thirds (2/3) vote of the City Council that it is impractical or no longer desirable to construct a Core Market Infrastructure Project identified in Exhibit B, that Core Market Infrastructure Project may be deleted or materially reduced in scope. If the City approves deletion or a material reduction in scope of a Core Market Infrastructure Project, it may also approve substitution of a Supplemental Market Infrastructure Project (Exhibit C to Attachment 1) or a different project; provided, however, that any such different project shall be a basic infrastructure upgrade to one or more PDA-owned buildings in the Market.

 B. The PDA may seek supplemental, matching or additional funds from other sources to pay all or part of the cost of the Market Infrastructure Projects. The PDA may apply such other funds to one or more Supplemental Market Infrastructure Projects or one or more Core Market Infrastructure Projects. To the extent such other funds offset Levy Proceeds identified to fund Market Infrastructure Projects, a like amount of Levy Proceeds shall be available for application to other Market Infrastructure Projects, as provided in the Agreement.

 Section 8. Contracting Outreach. The PDA will, when soliciting businesses for goods or services agreements in connection with Market Infrastructure Projects, perform outreach to small, economically disadvantaged businesses, including those owned by women and minorities. PDA agreements with businesses for goods and services and with other public entities and non-profits in connection with Market Infrastructure Projects will encourage these entities to employ a workforce reflective of the region's diversity. All PDA agreements for goods and services in connection with Market Infrastructure Projects will require the contracting entities to comply with all then-applicable requirements for non-discrimination in employment in federal, state, and City of Seattle laws and regulations.

 Section 9. Reporting. The Director of the PDA will prepare and submit to the City Council and the Mayor annual progress reports on the implementation of the Market Infrastructure Projects defined in Section 1. The City will have the right to audit the Market's levy expenditures at its discretion.

 Section 10. Election - Ballot Title. The King County Director of Records and Elections, as ex officio supervisor of elections, is hereby requested to conduct a special election, which the City hereby calls pursuant to RCW 84.55.050, to be held in conjunction with the state-wide general election on November 4, 2008, and to submit to the qualified electors of the City the proposition set forth herein.

 The City Clerk is hereby authorized and directed not less than eighty-four days prior to November 4, 2008, to certify the proposition to the King County Director of Records and Elections in the following form or as modified by the City Attorney pursuant to RCW 29A.26.071:

 ARTICLE 4.

 Application of Levy Proceeds

 Section 4.1 Amount to be Allocated. Subject to the requirements of this Agreement, the Total PDA Amount shall be provided to the PDA. The Total City Amount shall be retained by the City to pay City financing costs.

 Section 4.2 Annual PDA Requests. The projected cash flow incorporated as Exhibit A sets forth the anticipated timing and amount of monthly draws of increments of the Total PDA Amount expected to be paid to the PDA. On an annual basis, the PDA shall provide an updated cash flow to the Director. The updated cash flow shall be in the same form as Exhibit A, and shall show the portion of the Total PDA Amount previously disbursed as well as anticipated remaining monthly draws. The updated cash flow shall be submitted by the PDA Representative to the Director on or before October 1 of each

 year, except that the PDA's initial (October 1, 2008) updated cash flow shall be submitted to the Director no later than November 5, 2008. The PDA's updated cash flows may include monthly draw amounts that differ from the monthly draw amounts set forth in Exhibit A. If the PDA requests a monthly draw amount that is less than the amount set forth for the same month in Exhibit A, the difference shall accumulate to be available to the PDA for inclusion in a draw amount for a subsequent month or months, as determined by the PDA. If the PDA requests a monthly draw amount that is more than the draw amount set forth for the same month in Exhibit A, the difference shall be deducted from an amount requested for a subsequent month or months, as determined by the PDA.

 In addition to providing the annual updated cash flow required under this section, the PDA shall also promptly notify the City of any material change expected to occur in the timing or amount of draws set forth in a particular updated cash flow.

 Section 4.3 City Budget. The City's adopted budget will reflect the updated cash flows submitted pursuant to Section 4.2.

 Section 4.4 Financing; Interest Rate Assumptions. The City agrees to obtain financing to the extent necessary to provide funds to the PDA in accordance with updated cash flows submitted pursuant to Section 4.2. The form, timing and amount of any City debt will be solely in the City's discretion. The cash flow incorporated as Exhibit A projects debt service on City debt based on both the timing and amount of the PDA's projected draws and the Assumed Financing Costs. If Actual Financing Costs are less than or equal to the Assumed Financing Costs, the City will use a portion of the Total City Amount to pay the Actual Financing Costs, subject to any adjustment resulting from acceleration or deceleration of PDA draw requests pursuant to Section 4.5. If Actual Financing Costs exceed the Assumed Financing Costs, the City will pay the difference from City sources, subject to any adjustment resulting from acceleration or deceleration of PDA draw requests pursuant to Section 4.5. Notwithstanding the foregoing, to the extent that the Actual Financing Costs exceed the Assumed Financing Costs because the City's bond counsel determines that some or all of the City debt can not be issued as tax-exempt obligations, the PDA (and not the City) shall be responsible for the amount by which the Actual Financing Costs exceed the Assumed Financing Costs as a result of the taxable nature of those obligations (such difference in financing costs to be determined by the City's financial advisor, acting reasonably, based on the difference in interest costs between taxable and tax-exempt obligations of comparable maturities at the time the obligations are priced). If Actual Financing Costs on all City debt issued to finance the Total PDA Amount are less than the Assumed Financing Costs for reasons other than acceleration or deceleration of PDA draw requests (that is, if there are aggregate savings due to interest rates or costs of issuance that are lower than assumed), the City will apply the difference to reduce the amount of the Levy in the final year.

 Section 4.5 Increased Financing Costs Associated with Accelerated or Decelerated Draws. If the PDA has submitted an updated cash flow that requires the issuance of more City debt than is assumed in Exhibit A, an amount shall be deducted from the Total PDA Amount available to be drawn by the PDA, to be used to pay the resulting increase in financing costs. If the PDA has submitted an updated cash flow that requests draws that require the issuance of less City debt than is assumed in Exhibit A, the resulting savings will be added to the Total PDA Amount available to be drawn by the PDA. Attached as Exhibit D to this Agreement are examples demonstrating how increased costs and savings shall be calculated and allocated in the event that PDA draw amounts are accelerated or decelerated from the amounts set forth in Exhibit A. Within 30 days after the PDA has submitted an annual updated cash flow, the City shall provide such calculations to the PDA for its review and confirmation.

 Section 4.6 Investment of Levy Proceeds. The City shall hold all Levy Proceeds until distributed to the PDA pursuant to this Agreement. The City shall invest Levy Proceeds in accordance with State law and the City's investment policy. The City will apply investment earnings to pay debt service on City debt incurred pursuant to Section 4.4. Prior to the issuance of debt pursuant to Section 4.4 and to the extent that cumulative investment earnings are no longer needed for or exceed debt service requirements, investment earnings shall be retained by the City to reduce the amount of the Levy in the final year.

 Section 4.7 Phasing. The Core Market Infrastructure Projects will be undertaken by the PDA in phases as set forth in Exhibit B, each phase representing one or more PDA-owned buildings. For each phase, the PDA will prepare a budget, to be confirmed upon negotiation with its contractor of a guaranteed maximum price for that phase. Upon completion of a phase, any unspent Levy Proceeds for such phase will be applied as provided in Section 6.1.

 Section 4.8 Distribution of Funds. The PDA shall request draws of increments of the Total PDA Amount no more frequently than monthly. All requests shall include documentation as required in Section 4.9 and shall be submitted by the PDA Representative via email to the individual or group designated by the Director. If a request for funds is submitted in compliance with the requirements of this Agreement, the City shall provide funding within five Business Days after the request is submitted. If the City has not provided funding in the amount requested within five Business Days after a request is submitted, the City will pay interest on the amount not paid at the rate earned in the City's consolidated cash pool, commencing on the sixth Business Day after the request was submitted.

 Section 4.9 Documentation. Each request from the PDA to draw an increment of the Total PDA Amount shall be accompanied by a completed invoice of the PDA, copies of vendor invoices to be paid or reimbursed with the requested funds, an identification of the project or projects associated with each vendor invoice, and certification by the PDA Representative that the request complies with the terms of this Agreement. All documents are to be submitted with the request as PDF attachments to an email sent to the individual or group designated by the Director.

 Section 5.2 Use of Levy Proceeds by the PDA. Except as otherwise provided in this Agreement, the Total PDA Amount will be used only to pay the costs of Core Market Infrastructure Projects identified in Exhibit B and, to the extent permitted under Section 6.1, for Supplemental Market Infrastructure Projects identified in Exhibit C.

 Section 5.3 Public Art. The PDA shall spend at least $105,000 (which amount may be paid from a portion of the Total PDA Amount) to provide public art as part of the Market Infrastructure Program. The public art may be located anywhere within the Market. The selection

 of public art shall follow a process agreed to between the PDA and the City's Office of Arts & Cultural Affairs. It is expected that the Office of Arts & Cultural Affairs will have some representation on the review and selection panel. The public art, its location and display shall be subject to usual and customary review and approval by the Pike Place Market Historical Commission.

 Section 5.4 Excess Funds. In the event the PDA's actual cost of completion of any phase of construction of the Core Market Infrastructure Projects is less than the amount shown in Exhibit B, the unused portion for that phase may be applied only to Core Market Infrastructure Projects, or to one or more Supplemental Market Infrastructure Projects in accordance with Section 6.1.

 ARTICLE 6.

 Changes in Scope

 Section 6.1 Additions. A portion of the Total PDA Amount may fund all or a portion of the cost of one or more Supplemental Market Infrastructure Projects at the request of the PDA, subject to the approval of the Director. In seeking the approval of the Director to apply a portion of the Total PDA Amount to a Supplemental Market Infrastructure Project, the PDA must demonstrate to the Director's reasonable satisfaction the PDA's continuing capacity to complete the Core Market Infrastructure Projects within available resources.

 Section 6.2 Deletions or Material Reductions. A determination not to construct a Core Market Infrastructure Project or to materially reduce the scope of any Core Market Infrastructure Project in Exhibit B requires the approval of the City by an ordinance passed by the City Council by a vote of not less than a two-thirds majority of its members. In the event the PDA determines that, due to circumstances beyond its own control, it is unable to construct all Core Market Infrastructure Projects, it shall immediately notify the Director. The Director, in consultation with the PDA, shall take the following steps:

 (c) Evaluate the PDA's conclusion with respect to its inability to construct all Core Market Infrastructure Projects, including the circumstances cited by the PDA for its inability to do so;

 (d) Evaluate other sources of potential funding available to the PDA that would enable the PDA to construct the Core Market Infrastructure Projects;

 (e) Evaluate alternative projects that could provide some or all of the functional benefit of the Core Market Infrastructure Projects the PDA has determined it is unable to construct;

 (f) Evaluate alternatives to eliminating or materially reducing the scope of any Core Market Infrastructure Project the PDA has determined it is unable to construct including delayed delivery of any such Core Market Infrastructure Project; bridge financing to enable the PDA to timely complete any such Core Market Infrastructure Project; elimination of one or more lower priority projects in the Market Infrastructure Program to enable timely completion of the Core Market Infrastructure Project the PDA has determined it is unable to construct; and such other possible measures in the Director's discretion; and

 (g) Provide a recommendation to the City Council regarding the PDA's request that a Core Market Infrastructure Project be deleted or materially reduced in scope as well as such other action as he or she deems reasonably appropriate under the circumstances presented.

 ARTICLE 7.

 Other Funding

 Section 7.1 Cost Overrun Responsibility. The PDA will be responsible for all Core Market Infrastructure Project costs above the amounts shown in Exhibit B and will furnish any money necessary, in addition to the Total PDA Amount, to complete the Core Market Infrastructure Projects, except as permitted herein. The PDA acknowledges that the obligation of the City under this Agreement to provide the Total PDA Amount does not in any way constitute a representation, warranty, guaranty, advice or suggestion by the City as to the feasibility or viability of the Core Market Infrastructure Projects, and may not be relied on as such by any investor, tenant, lender, or other person, for any reason.

 Section 7.2 Other PDA Funding. The parties acknowledge that the PDA will seek other funding to construct the Market Infrastructure Projects and the PDA Projects, which would complement the funding from Levy Proceeds. The PDA intends to apply other funding to pay costs of Supplemental Market Infrastructure Projects as well as for costs of PDA Projects, if the PDA determines to proceed with such projects. To the extent that the PDA applies other funding to pay costs of Core Market Infrastructure Projects, the portion of the Total PDA Amount originally programmed to pay the cost of such projects will be added to the Market Infrastructure Program contingency.

 To the extent otherwise permitted by applicable law, the PDA may use a portion of its Total PDA Amount in a manner that enables it to obtain private investment in PDA-owned buildings under Federal income tax credit programs so long as an amount equal to the portion of the Total PDA Amount so applied is ultimately utilized to pay costs of Market Infrastructure Projects, all subject to restrictions on the sale of PDA-owned buildings under applicable law and its charter. Specifically, the PDA may apply for Federal new market tax credits for improvements to buildings to be improved during the first phase of the Market Infrastructure Program (consisting of the Hillclimb, Leland and Fairley buildings). If new market tax credits are obtained for this phase, an amount equal to the invested tax credit equity will be applied in the following order of priority:

 (a) PDA Projects (such as improvements to the Pike Market Child Care and Preschool facility, relocation of the PDA offices, and improvements to Pike Place);

 (b) Supplemental Market Infrastructure Projects in the Hillclimb, Leland and Fairley buildings; and

 (c) Core Market Infrastructure Projects in the Hillclimb, Leland and Fairley buildings.

 Section 7.3 Alternate Distribution of Funds. In the event that the provision of a portion of the Total PDA Amount prior to the actual completion of work is needed for the PDA to obtain Federal new market tax credits, the PDA will request a lump sum distribution. The City will disburse the requested lump sum provided that the PDA submits evidence demonstrating to the Director's satisfaction that the following conditions have been met: (a) that the PDA has a commitment from a Federal tax credit investor, (b) that the PDA has controls in place to guarantee that an amount equal to the lump sum distribution will be used to fund the projects authorized by the City Ordinance and in accordance with this Agreement, and (c) that the PDA has formed or identified a qualified low income community business entity to facilitate the tax credit investments. Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing in this Section shall in any way reduce or limit the PDA's obligation to comply with all federal, state and local laws applicable to obtaining other funding, including Federal new market tax credits.

 ARTICLE 8.

 Reporting

 Section 8.1 Phase Reports. The PDA will provide to the Director a report following completion of each phase of the Core Market Infrastructure Projects. The report for a phase shall be provided to the Director within 180 days after completion of the phase.

 Section 8.2 Annual Reports. The PDA will provide to the Director an annual financial and status report regarding the Market Infrastructure Projects, updating the budget and amount spent for the Market Infrastructure Project by phase and showing spent and remaining contingencies. The Authority shall also provide reports to the Mayor and City Council as required by the City Ordinance. Annual reports of the PDA shall be provided together with the annual updated cash flow required pursuant to Section 4.2. The City shall provide to the PDA an annual report on the status of the collection, investment and distribution of Levy Proceeds, and any financing in connection therewith. The annual report of the City shall be provided prior to the date the PDA is required to submit its annual updated cash flow pursuant to Section 4.2.

 Section 8.3 Audit. The PDA shall permit the City, from time to time as the City Auditor or the Director deems necessary (including up to six years after the final payment of any work funded by Levy Proceeds, or longer if the City deems it necessary for the City to comply with Internal Revenue Service records retention requirements in connection with tax-exempt bonds), to inspect and audit at any and all reasonable times and at such reasonable location as the City Auditor and/or Director selects, all pertinent books and records of the PDA or any other person or entity that has performed work funded by Levy Proceeds to verify, among other things, that all Levy Proceeds have been spent in compliance with this Agreement and applicable ordinances, that all documentation of funding requests is complete and accurate, and that work funded by Levy Proceeds has been performed in compliance with applicable contracts. Additionally, upon the City Auditor's or the Director's request, the PDA shall supply the City with, or shall permit the City to make, a copy of any books and records and any portion thereof. The PDA shall ensure that such inspection, audit and copying right of the City is a condition of any contract, agreement or other arrangement under which any other person or entity is permitted to perform work in connection with or related to the Market Infrastructure Program and the Levy Proceeds provided to the PDA under this Agreement.

 Section 8.4 Communication and Information. The City and the PDA recognize that well-planned and executed communication between the PDA and its tenants, customers, and stakeholders throughout the implementation of the Market Infrastructure Program will be essential to the program's success. To provide good communication, the PDA will work closely with Turner Construction (Contractor), its General Contractor/Construction Manager (GC/CM), to provide information in a variety of ways, including the following or other methods that will achieve substantially the same results.

 (a) The PDA will publish and distribute to tenants a bi-monthly paper newsletter (increased to monthly if warranted) devoted to Market Infrastructure Program news, progress, and events.

 (b) The PDA will hold regular public meetings, anticipated to be monthly but less frequently if warranted, for tenants and other members of the Market community to hear updates from, and provide comments to, the PDA and Contractor. Well in advance of each meeting, the PDA will publicize the date, time, and location of the meeting.

 (c) The PDA will provide and keep up-to-date an easy-to-navigate website with information about the Market Infrastructure Program, including - for meetings of the PDA Council, its Capital Renovation Committee, its Finance and Asset Management Committee, and public meetings related to the Market Infrastructure Program - meeting notices, meeting agendas, and an archive of meeting minutes or notes. The website will also include current and past newsletters, schedule for upcoming construction activities and general anticipated impacts, whom to contact with questions, and other relevant information. During construction, the website will include a dedicated comment/question e-mail box that will be reviewed and answered at least every two or three days.

 (d) Not less than one month before construction begins for each phase, the PDA and Contractor will meet with tenants in the affected areas for that phase to discuss the details of anticipated impacts, provide written notice of the anticipated date for starting construction, and provide a written scope of work for the area in the immediate vicinity of each tenant. These meetings will cover topics such as when a business can expect workers to be in or near the shop, who those workers will be, what work they will do, tips on how to protect and secure merchandise during construction activity, and if and how construction in a business tenant's immediate area will affect its business hours.

 (e) The PDA will assign a member of the PDA's capital renovation team to each phase of the Market Infrastructure Program, and will give tenants the name and phone number of this person to provide a clear line of communication for questions or problem-solving. The PDA will give tenants the name and phone number of a 24/7 contact in case of an emergency.

 (f) The PDA will provide a centrally-located Information Center in the Market where it will post information regarding the Market Infrastructure Program such as construction work plans, schedules for the current phase, and contact information for the responsible staff at the PDA and Contractor.

 (g) The PDA will hand-deliver to each tenant, post in the Information Center, and post in a designated location in each affected building, written Tenant Alerts to provide information about construction schedules.

 (h) During construction, the PDA will schedule meetings bi-weekly, or less frequently if warranted, for affected tenants to address group needs and concerns and provide input to the PDA about the project.

 (i) During construction, the PDA will deliver a written update at least weekly, or less frequently if warranted, to each affected tenant describing construction progress.
