 Maintenance of Facilities. Grantee shall, at its sole cost and expense, maintain the Facilities in good condition, repair and working order. If it becomes necessary to repair, clean or reconstruct any of the Facilities, Grantee shall have a right of entry on the Burdened Property for that purpose, subject to such reasonable requirements as Grantor may impose. Grantee agrees that a requirement that the Burdened Property be restored to its condition immediately before such repairs, cleaning or reconstruction and that Grantee obtain liability insurance satisfactory to and for the benefit of Grantor prior to commencing any such work, are reasonable.

 Term of Easement. The term of this Easement Agreement and the Utilities Easement shall commence as of the date of this Agreement and shall remain in full force and effect for the duration of the June 1, 1997, Ground Lease between the City of Seattle and the Experience Music Project.

 5. Indemnity. Grantee does hereby release and shall indemnify and hold Grantor harmless for, from and against all losses, liabilities, claims (including mechanics' or materialmen's liens), costs (including attorneys' fees), actions or damages of any sort or nature whatsoever incurred as a result of or arising out of the presence of or the use by Grantee or its servants, agents, employees and contractors of the Facilities or Grantee's exercise of its rights hereunder. In the event that any action is brought against Grantor by any employee of Grantee, the indemnification obligation of Grantee set forth in this Paragraph shall not be limited by a limit on the amount or type of damages, compensation or benefits payable by or for Grantee under RCW Title 51, the Industrial Insurance Act, or any other employee benefit act. In addition, solely for the purpose of giving full effect to the indemnities contained herein and not for the benefit of Grantee's employees or any third parties, Grantee waives its immunity under RCW Title 51. Grantee acknowledges that the parties have negotiated this indemnification.

 6. No Interference with Grantee's Use of Easement. Grantor shall not take any actions or permit acts by third parties that would unreasonably interfere with the purpose of this Easement Agreement or would otherwise unreasonably impair or interfere with Grantee's use and enjoyment of the Facilities.

 7. Covenant With the Land. The Utilities Easement granted herein and the rights and restrictions contained herein shall be covenants running with the land and shall be binding upon the Burdened Property and inure to the benefit of the Benefited Property.

 8. Grantor's Remedies Upon Grantee Default. Grantor shall only be entitled to terminate this Easement Agreement as a result of any default or breach by Grantee of any representation, warranty or covenant hereunder if (a) Grantor has given written notice of such default to Grantee and (b) Grantee has failed to cure such default within sixty (60) days of receipt of such written notice of default (or if the cure is not reasonably susceptible to cure within such sixty (60) day period, Grantee has commenced the cure within such sixty (60) day period and thereafter diligently pursues the cure to completion). Subject to the foregoing limitation, Grantor shall be entitled to pursue any and all other any right or remedy available at law or in equity for such default or breach by Grantee, including without limitation an action for specific performance, injunctive relief or actual damages.

 9. Notices.
