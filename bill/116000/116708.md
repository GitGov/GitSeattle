 AN ORDINANCE relating to drainage and wastewater services of Seattle Public Utilities; amending Section 21.28.040 of the Seattle Municipal Code to adjust wastewater rates; amending Section 21.33.030 of the Seattle Municipal Code to adjust drainage rates; and amending Section 21.76.040 of the Seattle Municipal Code to adjust credits to low-income drainage and wastewater customers.

 WHEREAS, drainage and wastewater rates were last increased on January 1, 2009, as authorized by Ordinance 122868; and

 WHEREAS, 2009 drainage and wastewater rates were approved based on a 2007 rate study by Seattle Public Utilities ("SPU") that proposed rates for 2008 and 2009; and

 WHEREAS, the endorsed 2010 budget anticipated a 2009 rate study that would propose drainage and wastewater rates for 2010 and beyond; and

 WHEREAS, to minimize rate payer impacts during the recession, no new rates were proposed for 2010, resulting in less revenue being available to support drainage and wastewater activities than was assumed in the endorsed budget; and

 WHEREAS, expenditures in the proposed 2010 budget are lower than those in the endorsed budget to reflect revenue constraints; and

 WHEREAS, to achieve lower expenditures, the proposed budget cuts or reduces key capital projects and operations and maintenance ("O&M") activities that support Clean Water Act compliance, flood reduction, water quality improvement, and infrastructure maintenance; and

 WHEREAS, the City Council wishes to raise 2010 drainage and wastewater rates so that these key capital projects and O&M activities can be conducted, and their benefits realized, in 2010; and

 WHEREAS, wastewater and drainage credits for qualified low-income customers, not billed directly by SPU for water or wastewater services, are based on typical residential bills, and credits for such customers need to be revised to reflect changes in wastewater rates; NOW, THEREFORE,

 BE IT ORDAINED BY THE CITY OF SEATTLE AS FOLLOWS:

 Section 1. Subsection 21.28.040 B of the Seattle Municipal Code is amended as follows:

 SMC 21.28.040 Wastewater volume charge.

 * * *

 B. The wastewater volume rate shall be the sum of the treatment rate, the system rate and, where applicable, the MMRD surcharge, as follows:

 1. Treatment rate: The "treatment rate" shall be the rate required to pay the wastewater share of "treatment cost" which is the cost of wastewater treatment, interception and disposal services and any associated costs required to meet Drainage and Wastewater Fund financial policies. The treatment rate shall be the amount obtained when (a) the projected wastewater treatment cost is divided by (b) the projected billed wastewater consumption, each for the next calendar year, and the result is multiplied by one hundred sixteen and seven-tenths percent (116.7%) to cover the costs of taxes and low income rate assistance. The projected treatment cost shall be the treatment cost anticipated for the upcoming calendar year, which may include an adjustment to reflect the difference, whether positive or negative, between the total expected treatment cost for the current year and the total wastewater volume charge revenues attributable to the treatment rate expected for the current year. The treatment rate is designed to pass through cost changes driven by King County and may be adjusted by ordinance at any time in response to such charges.

 2. System rate: The "system rate" shall be the rate required to pay the cost of carrying and discharging all wastewater and any wastewater funded- share of stormwater into the City sewerage system, as presently maintained and operated and as may be added to, improved and extended.

 3. The wastewater volume rate shall be in accordance with the following schedule:

 Section 2. Subsection 21.33.030 D of the Seattle Municipal Code is amended as follows:

 SMC 21.33.030 Drainage service charges and drainage rates - Schedule - Exemptions.

 * * *

 D. Drainage rates used in the calculation of drainage service charges shall be the sum of the treatment rate and the system rate, as follows:

 1. Treatment rate: The "treatment rate" shall be the rate required to pay the drainage share of "treatment cost" which is the cost of wastewater treatment, interception and disposal service, and any associated costs necessary to meet Drainage and Wastewater Fund policies. The treatment rate shall be the amount obtained when (a) the projected drainage treatment cost for each rate category is divided by (b) the projected number of billing units in each rate category and the result is multiplied by one hundred sixteen and three-tenths percent (116.3%) to cover the costs of taxes and low income rate assistance. The projected treatment cost shall be the treatment cost anticipated for the upcoming calendar year, which may include an adjustment to reflect the difference, whether positive or negative, between the drainage share of expected total treatment cost for the current year and the total drainage service charge revenues attributable to the treatment rate expected for the current year. The treatment rate is designed to pass through cost changes driven by King County and may be adjusted by ordinance at any time in response to such charges.

 2. System rate: The "system rate" shall be the rate required to fund the expense associated with operating, maintaining, and constructing the City's surface and stormwater management system, including any share of combined sanitary and stormwater system expense assigned to drainage.

 3. The rate categories and the corresponding annual drainage rates are as follows:
