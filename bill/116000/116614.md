 ORDINANCE _________________

 AN ORDINANCE relating to the Stormwater, Grading, and Drainage Control Code; repealing, re-enacting, and amending Chapters 22.800, 22.801, 22.802 and 22.808 of the Seattle Municipal Code, and adding Chapters 22.803, 22.805 and 22.807.

 WHEREAS, The City of Seattle (the "City") is subject to the terms of the National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System and State Waste Discharge General Permit for Discharges from Large and Small Municipal Separate Storm Sewer Systems ("Permit"), issued January 17, 2007, by the State of Washington Department of Ecology ("Ecology") in compliance with the federal Clean Water Act and state law, as the permit may be amended by Ecology; and

 WHEREAS the Permit requires that the City adopt ordinances and other enforceable documents that are determined by Ecology to be equivalent to the minimum technical requirements for new development and redevelopment contained in Appendix 1 of the Permit or equivalent to relevant portions of Ecology's 2005 Stormwater Management Manual for Western Washington ("Ecology's 2005 Manual") and that require the application of certain source control best management practices for pollutant-generating sources that are functionally equivalent to Ecology's 2005 Manual; and

 WHEREAS the Permit requires that the City evaluate and, if necessary, update existing ordinances and other regulatory mechanisms to effectively prohibit non-stormwater, illegal discharges and dumping into the City's municipal separate stormwater sewer system and that the City require maintenance of permanent stormwater treatment and flow control facilities regulated by the City that are as protective or more protective of facility function than those specified in Ecology's 2005 Manual; and

 WHEREAS Ecology has determined that the substance of this ordinance, together with the substance of an accompanying ordinance creating new Chapter 22.170 to be entitled "Grading Code" and of four new Directors' Rules to be issued jointly by the Director of Seattle Public Utilities (SPU) and the Director of the Planning and Development (DPD) entitled "Source Control Technical Requirements Manual," "Construction Stormwater Control Technical Requirements Manual," "Stormwater Flow Control and Water Quality Treatment Technical Requirements Manual," and "Stormwater Code Enforcement Manual" are equivalent to Appendix 1 of the Permit and the required portions of Ecology's 2005 Manual and meet relevant Permit requirements; and

 WHEREAS this ordinance also contains changes, initiated by the City and beyond the requirements of the Permit, to improve water quality and to further the purposes of this ordinance; and

 WHEREAS, Ecology is expected to modify the Permit in the future to incorporate low impact development requirements and a deadline for implementation, which could require the City again to revise its Stormwater Code; and

 WHEREAS, in developing stormwater and grading regulations that protect the functions and values of critical areas, including those in the Shoreline District, the City has included the best available science; and

 WHEREAS, protecting Seattle's water bodies is a central goal of the Mayor's Restore Our Waters strategy, the City of Seattle Comprehensive Plan, and Seattle Public Utilities Comprehensive Drainage Plan; and

 WHEREAS, drainage rate customers from the city ranked "improvement in water quality in lakes and streams" as the most important drainage investment; NOW THEREFORE,

 BE IT ORDAINED BY THE CITY OF SEATTLE AS FOLLOWS:

 Section 1. The text of Chapters 22.800, 22.801, 22.802, and 22.808 of the Seattle Municipal Code, last amended by Ordinance 122738 and previously amended by Ordinances 122055, 121276, 119965, 118396, 117852, 117789, 117697, and 117432, and adopted by Ordinance 116425, which currently reads as follows, is repealed:

~~Chapter 22.800 Title, Purpose, Scope and Authority~~22.800.010 Title.

 This subtitle, comprised of SMC Chapters 22.800 through 22.808, shall be known as the "Stormwater, Grading and Drainage Control Code," and may be cited as such.

 22.800.020 Purpose.

 A. The provisions of this subtitle shall be liberally construed to accomplish its remedial purposes, which are:

 1. Protect, to the greatest extent practicable, life, property and the environment from loss, injury and damage by pollution, erosion, flooding, landslides, strong ground motion, soil liquefaction, accelerated soil creep, settlement and subsidence, and other potential hazards, whether from natural causes or from human activity;

 2. Protect the public interest in drainage and related functions of drainage basins, watercourses and shoreline areas;

 3. Protect surface waters and receiving waters from pollution, mechanical damage, excessive flows and other conditions in their drainage basins which will increase the rate of downcutting, streambank erosion, and/or the degree of turbidity, siltation and other forms of pollution, or which will reduce their low flows or low levels to levels which degrade the environment, reduce recharging of groundwater, or endanger aquatic and benthic life within these surface waters and receiving waters of the state;

 4. Meet the requirements of state and federal law and the City's municipal stormwater NPDES permit; and

 5. Fulfill the responsibilities of the City as trustee of the environment for future generations.

 B. It is expressly the purpose of this subtitle to provide for and promote the health, safety and welfare of the general public. This subtitle is not intended to create or otherwise establish or designate any particular class or group of persons who will or should be especially protected or benefitted by its terms.

 C. It is expressly acknowledged that water quality degradation can result either directly from one discharge or through the collective impact of many small discharges. Therefore, the water quality protection measures in this subtitle are necessary to protect the health, safety and welfare of the residents of Seattle and the integrity of natural resources for the benefit of all and for the purposes of this subtitle. Such water quality protection measures are required under the federal Clean Water Act, 33 U.S.C. Section 1251, et seq., and in response to the obligations of the City's municipal stormwater discharge permit, issued by the State of Washington under the federal National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System program.

 22.800.030 Scope.

 This subtitle applies to:

 A. All grading and drainage and erosion control, whether or not a permit is required; and

 B. All new or replaced impervious surface and all land disturbing activities, whether or not a permit is required; and

 C. All discharges directly or indirectly to a public drainage control system; and

 D. All discharges directly or indirectly into surface waters within or contiguous to Seattle city limits; and

 E. All new and existing land uses.

 22.800.050 Potentially hazardous locations.

 A. Any site on a list, register, or data base compiled by the United States Environmental Protection Agency ("EPA") or the Washington State Department of Ecology ("DOE") for investigation, cleanup, or other action regarding contamination under any federal or state environmental law shall be a potentially hazardous location under this subtitle. When EPA or DOE removes the site from the list, register or data base, or when the owner otherwise establishes contamination does not pose a present or potential threat to human health or the environment, the site will no longer be considered a potentially hazardous location.

 B. The following property may also be designated by the Director of DCLU as potentially hazardous locations:

 1. Existing and abandoned solid waste disposal sites;

 2. Hazardous waste treatment, storage, or disposal facilities, all as defined by the federal Solid Waste Disposal Act, 42 U.S.C. section 6901, et seq.

 22.800.060 Compliance with other laws.

 A. The requirements of this subtitle are minimum requirements. They do not replace, repeal, abrogate, supersede or affect any other more stringent requirements, rules, regulations, covenants, standards, or restrictions. Where this subtitle imposes requirements which are more protective of human health or the environment than those set forth elsewhere, the provisions of this subtitle shall prevail.

 B. Approvals and permits granted under this subtitle are not waivers of the requirements of any other laws, nor do they indicate compliance with any other laws. Compliance is still required with all applicable federal, state and local laws and regulations, including rules promulgated under authority of this subtitle.

 C. Compliance with the provisions of this subtitle and of regulations and manuals adopted by the City in relation to this subtitle does not necessarily mitigate all impacts to the environment. Thus, compliance with this subtitle and related regulations and manuals should not be construed as mitigating all stormwater impacts, and additional mitigation may be required to protect the environment. The primary obligation for compliance with this chapter, and for preventing environmental harm on or from property, is placed upon responsible parties as defined by this subtitle.

 22.800.070 City projects.

 f. All temporary on-site conveyance channels shall be designed, constructed, and stabilized to prevent erosion from the expected velocity of a two (2)-year, twenty-four (24)-hour design storm for the developed condition. Stabilization adequate to prevent erosion of outlets, adjacent streambanks, slopes, and downstream reaches shall be provided at the outlets of all conveyance systems;

 g. Whenever construction vehicle access routes intersect paved roads, the transport of sediment onto the paved road shall be minimized. If sediment is transported onto a paved road surface, the roads shall be cleaned thoroughly at the end of each day. Sediment shall be removed from paved roads by shoveling or sweeping and shall be transported to a controlled sediment disposal area. Street washing shall be allowed only after sediment is removed in this manner;

 h. All temporary erosion and sediment controls shall be removed within thirty (30) days after final site stabilization is achieved or after the temporary controls are no longer needed, whichever is later. Trapped sediment shall be removed or stabilized on site. Disturbed soil areas resulting from removal shall be permanently stabilized;

 i. When dewatering devices discharge on site or to a public drainage control system, dewatering devices shall discharge into a sediment trap or sediment pond or gently sloping vegetated area; and

 j. In the construction of underground utility lines, where feasible, no more than five hundred (500) feet of trench shall be opened at one time, unless soil is replaced within the same working day, and where consistent with safety and space considerations, excavated material shall be placed on the uphill side of trenches.

 B. Joint and Several Liability. Each responsible party is jointly and severally liable for a violation of this subtitle. The Director of SPU or the Director of DCLU or both of them may take enforcement action, in whole or in part, against any responsible party. All applicable civil penalties may be imposed against each responsible party. In the event enforcement action is taken against more than one (1) responsible party, recoverable damages, costs, and expenses may be allocated among the responsible parties by the court or the Hearing Examiner based upon the extent to which each responsible party's acts or omissions caused the violation, unless this factor cannot be determined, or the party receiving the allocation under this factor is unable to correct the violation, or is unable to pay the damages, costs, expenses, and any penalty imposed, in which case the trier of fact shall consider:

 1. Awareness of the violation;

 2. Ability to correct the violation;

 3. Ability to pay the damages, costs, and expenses;

 4. Cooperation with government agencies;

 5. Degree to which any impact or threatened impact on water or sediment quality, human health, or the environment is related to acts or omissions by each responsible party;

 6. Degree to which the responsible parties made good- faith efforts to avoid a violation or to mitigate its consequences; and

 7. Other equitable factors.

 C. Defenses. A responsible party shall not be liable under this subtitle when the responsible party carries the burden of proving, by a preponderance of the evidence, one (1) of the following defenses:

 1. The violation was caused solely by an act of God;

 2. The violation was caused solely by another responsible party over whom the defending responsible party had no authority or control and the defending responsible party could not have reasonably prevented the violation;

 3. The violation was caused solely by a prior owner or occupant when the defending responsible party took possession of the property without knowledge of the violation, after using reasonable efforts to identify violations. However, the defending responsible party shall be liable for all continuing, recurrent, or new violations after becoming the owner or occupant;

 4. The responsible party implemented and maintained all appropriate drainage control facilities, treatment facilities, flow control facilities, erosion and sediment controls, source controls and best management practices identified in rules promulgated by the Director of DCLU and the Director of SPU, or in manuals published by the State Department of Ecology until superseded by rules of the Directors, or as otherwise identified and required of the responsible party by the Director in writing pursuant to this subtitle.

 22.808.025 Right of entry.

 With the consent of the owner or occupant of a building or premises, or pursuant to a lawfully issued warrant, the Director of DCLU may enter a building or premises at any reasonable time to perform the duties imposed by this code.

Service by certified mail shall be effective on the date of mailing. If the whereabouts of the responsible party is unknown and cannot be ascertained in the exercise of reasonable diligence, and either Director makes an affidavit to that effect, then service may be accomplished by publishing the notice once each week for two (2) consecutive weeks in the City official newspaper.

 C. Alternatives to Notice of Violation.

 1. Stop-work Order.

 a. In lieu of issuing a notice of violation, the Director of SPU or the Director of DCLU may order work on a site stopped when he or she determines it is necessary to do so in order to obtain compliance with or to correct a violation of any provision of this subtitle or rules promulgated hereunder or to correct a violation of a permit or approval granted under this subtitle. The stop-work notice shall contain the following information:

 i. A description of the violation; and

The Director of SPU and the Director of DCLU are each authorized to enter any property when it reasonably appears that a condition associated with grading, drainage, erosion control or a drainage control facility creates a substantial and present or imminent danger to the public health, safety or welfare, the environment, or public or private property. The Director of SPU and the Director of DCLU each may enter property without permission or an administrative warrant in the case of an extreme emergency placing human life, property or the environment in immediate and substantial jeopardy which requires corrective action before either permission or an administrative warrant can be obtained.

 b. The Director of SPU or the Director of DCLU or both of them may order the responsible party to take corrective action and set a schedule for compliance and may require immediate compliance with an order to correct. Any emergency which is not corrected as ordered by the Director of SPU or the Director of DCLU is a public nuisance which each Director is authorized to abate summarily. The costs of abatement shall be collected as set forth in Section 22.808.080.

 D. Appeal of Director's Decisions. Any Notice of Violation or final order other than a stop-work order or emergency order issued by the Director of SPU or the Director of DCLU pursuant to this subtitle may be appealed to the Hearing Examiner by an aggrieved person. Appeals shall be initiated by filing a written notice with the applicable fee, as set forth in SMC Section 23.76.022. When, as set forth in Section 22.808.070, an invoice is issued without a prior hearing, the appeal period shall commence upon issuance of the invoice.

 E. Filing Notice or Order. A notice of violation, voluntary compliance agreement or an order issued by a Director of SPU, Director of DCLU, Hearing Examiner or municipal Judge, may be filed with the King County Department of Records and Elections.

 B. Enforcement Through Hearing Examiner's Office. Enforcement actions through the Office of the Hearing Examiner shall proceed according to this subsection.

 1. Hearing Schedule. The Hearing Examiner's Office shall schedule a hearing after notification by the Director that enforcement will be pursued through the Hearing Examiner's Office.

 2. Conduct of the Hearing. The Hearing Examiner shall conduct a hearing on the violation pursuant to the rules of procedure of the Hearing Examiner, as modified by this section. The Director, the person to whom the notice of violation was issued, and any other responsible party regarding the matters addressed in the notice of violation may participate as parties in the hearing, with or without representation by an attorney. Each party may call and compel the attendance of witnesses.

 3. Standard of Review and Burden of Proof. The determinations of the Director of Seattle Public Utilities and the determinations of the Director of Construction and Land Use shall be accorded substantial weight by the Hearing Examiner. The defending responsible party shall have the burden of proving by a preponderance of the evidence all defenses, mitigating factors and objections to the required corrective action or schedule.

 4. Hearing Examiner's Order. The Hearing Examiner shall affirm, vacate or modify the Director's determinations. The Hearing Examiner shall issue an order within fifteen (15) days following the close of the record unless all parties agree to an extension of time. The order shall contain the following information:

 a. The decision regarding the alleged violation;

 b. Findings of fact and conclusions based thereon in support of the decision;

 c. The required corrective action (if any);

 d. The date and time by which the corrective action must be completed;

 e. The monetary penalties and other costs, expenses, or damages being assessed against the responsible party;

 f. Notice that the responsible party has twenty- one (21) days from the date of issuance of the decision to petition for judicial review, as provided by Section 705 of Chapter 347 of the Laws of 1995; and

 g. Authorization for the City to abate or correct the violation following expiration of the appeal period and the time set for compliance with the order if the responsible party has not completed the required corrective action, and to charge the responsible party for its costs, as set forth in Section 22.808.080. The order shall not require the City to abate or correct the violation.

 5. Failure to Appear. If the responsible party to whom the notice of violation was issued fails to appear at a scheduled hearing before the Hearing Examiner, and no other responsible party appears to defend, then, upon an offer of proof by the City, which may be made by declaration, the Hearing Examiner shall issue an order finding that the violation occurred. The order shall contain the information set forth in subsection B4 above. In the absence of an offer of proof by the City, the Hearing Examiner shall issue an order finding the responsible party to be in default, and setting forth the penalties and other relief described in subsection B4.

 22.808.050 Voluntary compliance agreement.

 A. Initiation. Either a responsible party or the Director of Seattle Public Utilities or the Director of Construction and Land Use may initiate negotiations for a voluntary compliance agreement at any time. Neither Director has any obligation to enter into any voluntary compliance agreement.

 B. Contents. A voluntary compliance agreement shall set forth actions to be taken by the responsible party that will correct past or existing violations of this subtitle. It may also set forth actions to mitigate the impacts of violations. The voluntary compliance agreement shall set forth a schedule for completion of the corrective and mitigating actions. It shall contain a provision allowing the Director of Seattle Public Utilities and the Director of Construction and Land Use to inspect the premises to determine compliance with the agreement.

 C. Effect of Agreement.

 1. A voluntary compliance agreement is a binding contract between the party executing it and the City. It is not enforceable by any other party. All voluntary compliance agreements shall provide that the responsible party agrees the City may perform the actions set forth in the agreement if the responsible party fails to do so according to the terms and schedule of the agreement, and the responsible party will pay the costs, expenses and damages the City incurs in performing the actions, as set forth in Section 22.808.080 regarding abatements. By entering into a voluntary compliance agreement, a responsible party waives the right to an administrative appeal of the violation.

 2. Penalties may be reduced or waived if violations are corrected or mitigated according to the terms and schedule of a voluntary compliance agreement. If the responsible party fails to perform according to the terms and schedule of the voluntary compliance agreement, penalties for each violation addressed in the agreement may be assessed starting from the date the violation occurred.

 D. Modification. The terms and schedule of the voluntary compliance agreement may be modified by mutual agreement of the responsible party and either Director if circumstances or conditions outside the responsible party's control, or unknown at the time the agreement was made, or other just cause necessitate such modifications.

 22.808.060 Penalties and damages.

 A. Commencement of Penalties. The Hearing Examiner and any Judge hearing matters under this subtitle shall have the following options in assessing monetary penalties:

 1. Assess monetary penalties beginning on the date the notice of violation was issued and thereafter; or

 2. Assess monetary penalties beginning on the correction deadline set by the Director or an alternate deadline for corrective action set by the Judge or Hearing Examiner, and thereafter; or

 3. Assess no monetary penalties; or

 4. When it appears likely the responsible party will perform the required corrective action, suspend assessment of the penalty conditioned upon completion of the corrective action by the ordered deadline.

 B. Schedule of Penalties.

 1. Basic Penalty. Each day or portion thereof during which a violation of this subtitle exists is a separate violation of this subtitle. The cumulative monetary penalty for each violation of this subtitle shall be as follows:

 a. The penalty for the first day a violation exists is One Hundred Dollars ($100.00);

Chapter 22.800 TITLE, PURPOSE, SCOPE AND AUTHORITY

22.800.010 Title  This subtitle, comprised of Chapters 22.800 through 22.808, shall be known as the "Stormwater Code" and may be cited as such.

 22.800.020

Purpose  A.

The provisions of this subtitle shall be liberally construed to accomplish its remedial purposes, which are:  1.

Protect, to the greatest extent practicable, life, property and the environment from loss, injury and damage by pollution, erosion, flooding, landslides, strong ground motion, soil liquefaction, accelerated soil creep, settlement and subsidence, and other potential hazards, whether from natural causes or from human activity;  2. Protect the public interest in drainage and related functions of drainage basins, watercourses and shoreline areas;

 3. Protect receiving waters from pollution, mechanical damage, excessive flows and other conditions in their drainage basins which will increase the rate of downcutting, streambank erosion, and/or the degree of turbidity, siltation and other forms of pollution, or which will reduce their low flows or low levels to levels which degrade the environment, reduce recharging of groundwater, or endanger aquatic and benthic life within these receiving waters and receiving waters of the state;

 4. Meet the requirements of state and federal law and the City's municipal stormwater National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System ("NPDES") permit;

 5. To protect the functions and values of environmentally critical areas as required under the state's Growth Management Act and Shoreline Management Act;

 6. To protect the public drainage system from loss, injury and damage by pollution, erosion, flooding, landslides, strong ground motion, soil liquefaction, accelerated soil creep, settlement and subsidence, and other potential hazards, whether from natural causes or from human activity; and

 7. Fulfill the responsibilities of the City as trustee of the environment for future generations.

 B. It is expressly the purpose of this subtitle to provide for and promote the health, safety and welfare of the general public. This subtitle is not intended to create or otherwise establish or designate any particular class or group of persons who will or should be especially protected or benefited by its terms.

 C. It is expressly acknowledged that water quality degradation can result either directly from one discharge or through the collective impact of many small discharges. Therefore, the water quality protection measures in this subtitle are necessary to protect the health, safety and welfare of the residents of Seattle and the integrity of natural resources for the benefit of all and for the purposes of this subtitle. Such water quality protection measures are required under the federal Clean Water Act, 33 U.S.C. Section 1251, et seq., and in response to the obligations of the City's municipal stormwater discharge permit, issued by the State of Washington under the federal National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System program.

 22.800.060 Compliance With Other Laws

 A. The requirements of this subtitle are minimum requirements. They do not replace, repeal, abrogate, supersede or affect any other more stringent requirements, rules, regulations, covenants, standards, or restrictions. Where this subtitle imposes requirements that are more protective of human health or the environment than those set forth elsewhere, the provisions of this subtitle shall prevail. When this subtitle imposes requirements that are less protective of human health or the environment than those set forth elsewhere, the provisions of the more protective requirements shall prevail.

 B. Approvals and permits granted under this subtitle are not waivers of the requirements of any other laws, nor do they indicate compliance with any other laws. Compliance is still required with all applicable federal, state and local laws and regulations, including rules promulgated under authority of this subtitle.

 C. Compliance with the provisions of this subtitle and of regulations and manuals adopted by the City in relation to this subtitle does not necessarily mitigate all impacts to the environment. Thus, compliance with this subtitle and related regulations and manuals should not be construed as mitigating all drainage water or other environmental impacts, and additional mitigation may be required to protect the environment. The primary obligation for compliance with this subtitle, and for preventing environmental harm on or from property, is placed upon responsible parties as defined by this subtitle.

 D. Minimum Requirements for Construction Site Stormwater Pollution Prevention Control. Temporary and permanent construction controls shall be used to accomplish the following minimum requirements. All projects are required to meet each of the elements below or document why an element is not applicable. Additional controls may be required by the Director when minimum controls are not sufficient to prevent erosion or transport of sediment or other pollutants from the site.

 1. Mark Clearing Limits and Environmentally Critical Areas. Within the boundaries of the project site and prior to beginning land disturbing activities, including clearing and grading, clearly mark all clearing limits, easements, setbacks, all environmentally critical areas and their buffers, and all trees, and drainage courses that are to be preserved within the construction area.

 2. Retain Top Layer. Within the boundaries of the project site, the duff layer, topsoil, and native vegetation, if there is any, shall be retained in an undisturbed state to the maximum extent feasible. If it is not feasible to retain the top layer in place, it should be stockpiled on-site, covered to prevent erosion, and replaced immediately upon completion of the ground disturbing activities to the maximum extent feasible.

 3. Establish Construction Access. Limit construction vehicle access, whenever possible, to one route. Stabilize access points and minimize tracking sediment onto public roads. Promptly remove any sediment tracked off site.

 4. Protect Downstream Properties and Receiving Waters. Protect properties and receiving waters downstream from the development sites from erosion due to increases in the volume, velocity, and peak flow rate of drainage water from the project site. If it is necessary to construct flow control facilities to meet this requirement, these facilities shall be functioning prior to implementation of other land disturbing activity. If permanent infiltration ponds are used to control flows during construction, these facilities shall be protected from siltation during the construction phase of the project.

 5. Prevent Erosion and Sediment Transport from the Site. Pass all drainage water from disturbed areas through a sediment trap, sediment pond, or other appropriate sediment removal BMP before leaving the site or prior to discharge to an infiltration facility. Sediment controls intended to trap sediment on site shall be constructed as one of the first steps in grading and shall be functional before other land disturbing activities take place. BMPs intended to trap sedimentation shall be located in a manner to avoid interference with the movement of juvenile salmonids attempting to enter off-channel areas or drainages.

 6. Prevent Erosion and Sediment Transport from the Site by Vehicles. Whenever construction vehicle access routes intersect paved roads, the transport of sediment onto the paved road shall be minimized. If sediment is transported onto a paved road surface, the roads shall be cleaned thoroughly at the end of each day. Sediment shall be removed from paved roads by shoveling or sweeping and shall be transported to a controlled sediment disposal area. If sediment is tracked off site, roads shall be cleaned thoroughly at the end of each day, or at least twice daily during wet weather. Street washing is allowed only after sediment is removed and street wash wastewater shall be prevented from entering the public drainage system and receiving waters.

 7. Stabilize Soils. Prevent on-site erosion by stabilizing all exposed and unworked soils, including stock piles and earthen structures such as dams, dikes, and diversions. From October 1 to April 30, no soils shall remain exposed and unworked for more than two days. From May 1 to September 30, no soils shall remain exposed for more than seven days. Soils shall be stabilized at the end of the shift before a holiday or weekend if needed based on the weather forecast. Soil stockpiles shall be stabilized from erosion, protected with sediment trapping measures, and be located away from storm drain inlets, waterways, and drainage channels. Before the completion of the project, permanently stabilize all exposed soils that have been disturbed during construction.

 8. Protect Slopes. Erosion from slopes shall be minimized. Cut and fill slopes shall be designed and constructed in a manner that will minimize erosion. Off-site stormwater run-on or groundwater shall be diverted away from slopes and undisturbed areas with interceptor dikes, pipes, and/or swales. Pipe slope drains or protected channels shall be constructed at the top of slopes to collect drainage and prevent erosion. Excavated material shall be placed on the uphill side of trenches, consistent with safety and space considerations. Check dams shall be placed at regular intervals within constructed channels that are cut down a slope.

 9. Protect Storm Drains. Prevent sediment from entering all storm drains, including ditches that receive drainage water from the project. Storm drain inlets protection devices shall be cleaned or removed and replaced as recommended by the product manufacturer, or more frequently if required to prevent failure of the device or flooding. Storm drain inlets made operable during construction shall be protected so that drainage water does not enter the drainage system without first being filtered or treated to remove sediments. Storm drain inlet protection devices shall be removed at the conclusion of the project. When manufactured storm drain inlet protection devices are not feasible, inlets and catch basins must be cleaned as necessary to prevent sediment from entering the drainage control system.

 10. Stabilize Channels and Outlets. All temporary on-site drainage systems shall be designed, constructed, and stabilized to prevent erosion. Stabilization shall be provided at the outlets of all drainage systems that is adequate to prevent erosion of outlets, adjacent stream banks, slopes, and downstream reaches.

 11. Control Pollutants. Measures shall be taken to control potential pollutants that include, but are not limited to, the following measures:

 a. All pollutants, including sediment, waste materials, and demolition debris, that occur onsite shall be handled and disposed of in a manner that does not cause contamination of drainage water and per all applicable disposal laws.

 b. Containment, cover, and protection from vandalism shall be provided for all chemicals, liquid products, petroleum products, and other materials that have the potential to pose a threat to human health or the environment.

 c. On-site fueling tanks shall include secondary containment.

 d. Maintenance, fueling, and repair of heavy equipment and vehicles involving oil changes, hydraulic system drain down, solvent and de-greasing cleaning operations, fuel tank drain down and removal, and other activities which may result in discharge or spillage of pollutants to the ground or into drainage water runoff shall be conducted using spill prevention and control measures.

 e. Contaminated surfaces shall be cleaned immediately following any discharge or spill incident.

 f. Wheel wash or tire bath wastewater shall be discharged to a separate on-site treatment system or to the sanitary sewer or combined sewer system with approval of the Director of SPU. Temporary discharges or connections to the public sanitary and combined sewers shall be made in accordance with Chapter 21.16 (Side Sewer Code).

 g. Application of fertilizers and pesticides shall be conducted in a manner and at application rates that will not result in loss of chemical to drainage water. Manufacturers' label requirements for application rates and procedures shall be followed.

 h. BMPs shall be used to prevent or treat contamination of drainage water by pH-modifying sources. These sources include, but are not limited to, bulk cement, cement kiln dust, fly ash, new concrete washing and curing waters, waste streams generated from concrete grinding and sawing, exposed aggregate processes, and concrete pumping and mixer washout waters. Construction site operators may be required to adjust the pH of drainage water if necessary to prevent a violation of water quality standards. Construction site operators must obtain written approval from Ecology prior to using chemical treatment other than carbon dioxide (CO2) or dry ice to adjust pH.

 12. Control Dewatering. When dewatering devices discharge on site or to a public drainage system, dewatering devices shall discharge into a sediment trap, sediment pond, gently sloping vegetated area of sufficient length to remove sediment contamination, or other sediment removal BMP. Foundation, vault, and trench dewatering waters must be discharged into a controlled drainage system prior to discharge to a sediment trap or sediment pond. Clean, non-turbid dewatering water, such as well-point ground water, that is discharged to systems tributary to state surface waters must not cause erosion or flooding. Highly turbid or contaminated dewatering water shall be handled separately from drainage water. For any project with an excavation depth of 12 feet or more below the existing grade and for all large projects, dewatering flows must be determined and it must be verified that there is sufficient capacity in the public drainage system and public combined sewer prior to discharging.

 13. Maintain BMPs. All temporary and permanent erosion and sediment control BMPs shall be maintained and repaired as needed to assure continued performance of their intended function. All temporary erosion and sediment controls shall be removed within five days after final site stabilization is achieved or after the temporary controls are no longer needed, whichever is later. Trapped sediment shall be removed or stabilized on site. Disturbed soil areas resulting from removal shall be permanently stabilized.

 14. Inspect BMPs. BMPs shall be periodically inspected. For projects with 5,000 square feet or more of new plus replaced impervious surface or 7,000 square feet or more of land disturbing activity, site inspections shall be conducted by a Certified Erosion and Sediment Control Lead who shall be identified in the Construction Stormwater Control Plan and shall be present on-site or on-call at all times.

 15. Execute Construction Stormwater Control Plan. Construction site operators shall maintain, update, and implement their Construction Stormwater Control Plan. Construction site operators shall modify their Construction Stormwater Control Plan to maintain compliance whenever there is a change in design, construction, operation, or maintenance at the site that has, or could have, a significant effect on the discharge of pollutants to waters of the state.

 16 Minimize Open Trenches. In the construction of underground utility lines, where feasible, no more than 150 feet of trench shall be opened at one time, unless soil is replaced within the same working day, and where consistent with safety and space considerations, excavated material shall be placed on the uphill side of trenches. Trench dewatering devices shall discharge into a sediment trap or sediment pond.

 17. Phase the Project. Development projects shall be phased to the maximum extent feasible in order to minimize the amount of land disturbing activity occurring at the same time and shall take into account seasonal work limitations.

Water quality treatment facilities shall be installed to the extent allowed by law and maintained per rules promulgated by the Director to treat flows from the pollution generating pervious and impervious surfaces on the site being developed. When stormwater flows from other areas, including non-pollution generating surfaces (e.g., roofs), dewatering activities, and offsite areas, cannot be separated or bypassed, treatment BMPs shall be designed for the entire area draining to the treatment facility. All projects shall use green stormwater infrastructure the maximum extent feasible to meet the minimum requirements.

 1. Runoff Volume. Stormwater treatment facilities shall be designed based on the stormwater runoff volume from the contributing area or a peak flow rate as follows:

 a. The daily runoff volume at or below which 91 percent of the total runoff volume for the simulation period occurs, as determined using an approved continuous model. It is calculated as follows:

 1) Rank the daily runoff volumes from highest to lowest.

 2) Sum all the daily volumes and multiply by 0.09.

 3) Sequentially sum daily runoff volumes, starting with the highest value, until the total equals 9 percent of the total runoff volume. The last daily value added to the sum is defined as the water quality design volume.

 b. Different design flow rates are required depending on whether a treatment facility will be located upstream or downstream of a detention facility:

 1) For facilities located upstream of detention or when detention is not required, the design flow rate is the flow rate at or below which 91 percent of the total runoff volume for the simulation period is treated, as determined using an approved continuous runoff model.

 2) For facilities located downstream of detention, the design flow rate is the release rate from the detention facility that has a 50 percent annual probability of occurring in any given year (2- year recurrence interval), as determined using an approved continuous runoff model.

 c. Infiltration facilities designed for water quality treatment must infiltrate 91 percent of the total runoff volume as determined using an approved continuous runoff model. To prevent the onset of anaerobic conditions, an infiltration facility designed for water quality treatment purposes must be designed to drain the water quality design treatment volume (the 91st percentile, 24-hour volume) within 48 hours.

The Director shall serve the notice upon a responsible party either by personal service, by first class mail, or by certified mail return receipt requested, to the party's last known address. If the address of the responsible party cannot be found after a reasonable search, the notice may be served by posting a copy of the notice at a conspicuous place on the property. Alternatively, if the whereabouts of the responsible party is unknown and cannot be ascertained in the exercise of reasonable diligence, and the Director makes an affidavit to that effect, then service may be accomplished by publishing the notice once each week for two consecutive weeks in the City official newspaper.

4. Nothing in this subtitle shall be deemed to obligate or require the Director to issue a Notice of Violation or order prior to the initiation of enforcement action by the City Attorney's Office pursuant to subsection 22.808.030.E.  C. Stop Work and Emergency Orders.

1. Stop Work Order. The Director may order work on a site stopped when he or she determines it is necessary to do so in order to obtain compliance with or to correct a violation of any provision of this subtitle or rules promulgated hereunder or to correct a violation of a permit or approval granted under this subtitle.

a. The stop work notice shall contain the following information:

1) A description of the violation; and

2) An order that the work be stopped until corrective action has been completed and approved by the Director.

b. The stop work order shall be personally served on the responsible party or posted conspicuously on the premises.

2. Emergency Order.

a. The Director may order a responsible party to take emergency corrective action and set a schedule for compliance and/or may require immediate compliance with an emergency order to correct when the Director determines that it is necessary to do so in order to obtain immediate compliance with or to correct a violation of any provision of this subtitle, or to correct a violation of a permit or approval granted under this subtitle.

b. An emergency order shall be personally served on the responsible party or posted conspicuously on the premises.

c. The Director is authorized to enter any property to investigate and correct a condition associated with grading, drainage, erosion control, drainage water, or a drainage control facility when it reasonably appears that the condition creates a substantial and present or imminent danger to the public health, safety or welfare, the environment, or public or private property. The Director may enter property without permission or an administrative warrant in the case of an extreme emergency placing human life, property, or the environment in immediate and substantial jeopardy which requires corrective action before either permission or an administrative warrant can be obtained. The cost of such emergency corrective action shall be collected as set forth in subsection 22.808.060.

3. Director's Review of Stop Work and Emergency Order. A stop work order or emergency order shall be final and not subject to a Director's review.  D. Review by Director.

1. A Notice of Violation, Director's order, or invoice issued pursuant to this subtitle shall be final and not subject to further appeal unless an aggrieved party requests in writing a review by the Director within ten days after service of the Notice of Violation, order or invoice. When the last day of the period so computed is a Saturday, Sunday or federal or City holiday, the period shall run until 5:00 p.m. on the next business day.

2. Following receipt of a request for review, the Director shall notify the requesting party, any persons served the Notice of Violation, order or invoice, and any person who has requested notice of the review, that the request for review has been received by the Director. Additional information for consideration as part of the review shall be submitted to the Director no later than 15 days after the written request for a review is mailed.  3. The Director will review the basis for issuance of the Notice of Violation, order, or invoice and all information received by the deadline for submission of additional information for consideration as part of the review. The Director may request clarification of information received and a site visit. After the review is completed, the Director may:

a. Sustain the Notice of Violation, order, or invoice;

b. Withdraw the Notice of Violation, order or invoice;

c. Continue the review to a date certain for receipt of additional information; or

d. Modify or amend the Notice of Violation, order, or invoice.

4. The Director's decision shall become final and is not subject to further administrative appeal.  E. Referral to City Attorney for Enforcement. If a responsible party fails to correct a violation or pay a penalty as required by a Notice of Violation, or fails to comply with a Director's order, the Director shall refer the matter to the City Attorney's Office for civil or criminal enforcement action. Civil actions to enforce a violation of this subtitle shall be exclusively in Municipal Court.

 F. Appeal to Superior Court. Because civil actions to enforce Title 22 are brought exclusively in Municipal Court, notices of violation, orders, and all other actions made under this chapter are not subject to judicial review under chapter 36.70C RCW. Instead, final decisions of the Municipal Court on enforcement actions authorized by this chapter may be appealed under the Rules of Appeals of Decisions of Courts of Limited Jurisdiction.

 G. Filing of Notice or Order. A Notice of Violation, voluntary compliance agreement or an order issued by the Director or court, may be filed with the King County Recorder's Office.

 H. Change of Ownership. When a Notice of Violation, voluntary compliance agreement, or an order issued by the Director or court has been filed with the King County Recorder's Office, a Notice of Violation or an order regarding the same violations need not be served upon a new owner of the property where the violation occurred. If no Notice of Violation or order is served upon the new owner, the Director may grant the new owner the same number of days to comply as was given the previous owner. The compliance period for the new owner shall begin on the date that the conveyance of title to the new owner is completed.

 22.808.040 Voluntary Compliance Agreement

 A. Initiation. Either a responsible party or the Director may initiate negotiations for a voluntary compliance agreement at any time. Neither has any obligation to enter into any voluntary compliance agreement.

 B. Contents. A voluntary compliance agreement shall identify actions to be taken by the responsible party that will correct past or existing violations of this subtitle. The agreement may also identify actions to mitigate the impacts of violations. The agreement shall contain a schedule for completion of the corrective actions and any mitigating actions. The agreement shall contain a provision allowing the Director to inspect the premises to determine compliance with the agreement. The agreement shall provide that the responsible party agrees the City may perform the actions set forth in the agreement if the responsible party fails to do so according to the terms and schedule of the agreement, and the responsible party will pay the costs, expenses and damages the City incurs in performing the actions, as set forth in Section 22.808.060.

 C. Effect of Agreement.

1. A voluntary compliance agreement is a binding contract between the party executing it and the City. It is not enforceable by any other party. By entering into a voluntary compliance agreement, a responsible party waives the right to Director's Review of the Notice of Violation or order.  2. Penalties may be reduced or waived if violations are corrected or mitigated according to the terms and schedule of a voluntary compliance agreement. If the responsible party fails to perform according to the terms and schedule of the voluntary compliance agreement, penalties for each violation addressed in the agreement may be assessed starting from the date the violation occurred, or as otherwise provided for in a Notice of Violation or Director's order.

 D. Modification. The terms and schedule of the voluntary compliance agreement may be modified by mutual agreement of the responsible party and either Director if circumstances or conditions outside the responsible party's control, or unknown at the time the agreement was made, or other just cause necessitate such modifications.

 22.808.050 Penalties and Damages

 A. Assessment of Penalties by the Director. The Director, after considering all available information, may assess a penalty for each violation of this subtitle based upon the Schedule of Civil Penalties.

 B. Schedule of Civil Penalties. The Director shall determine penalties as follows:

1. Basic Penalty.

a. Maximum Penalty. A violation of this subtitle is subject to a maximum civil penalty of up to $5,000. Each day or portion thereof during which a violation of this subtitle exists is a separate violation of this subtitle.

b. Commencement Date. The penalty shall commence on the date of the violation, unless otherwise provided for in a Notice of Violation or Director's order.

c. Assessment Matrix. The penalty shall be assessed using a matrix of criteria and scored as defined in rules promulgated by the Director. The total score will equate with a penalty up to a maximum of $5000 for each violation. The penalty shall be rated for severity by using the criteria listed below and by answering "No", "Possibly", "Probably", or "Definitely":

1) Does the violation pose a public health risk;

2) Does the violation cause environmental damage or adversely impact infrastructure;

3) Was the responsible party willful or knowing of the violation;

4) Was the responsible party unresponsive in correcting the violation;

5) Was there improper operation or maintenance;

6) Was there a failure to obtain necessary permits or approval;

7) Does the violation provide economic benefit for non-compliance; and

8) Was the violation a repeat violation.  C. Penalty for Significant Violation. For violations causing significant harm to public health, safety, welfare, the environment, or private or public property, the Director may, as an alternative to the Basic Penalty, refer the matter to the City Attorney's Office for enforcement and request the City Attorney seek a penalty equivalent to the economic benefit the responsible party derived from the violation. Significant harm is damage or injury which cannot be fully corrected or mitigated by the responsible party, and which cannot be adequately compensated for by assessment of the Basic Penalty and costs, expenses, or damages under this subtitle. Economic benefit may be determined by savings in costs realized by the responsible party, value received by the responsible party, increased income to the responsible party, increase in market value of property, or any other method reasonable under the circumstances.

 D. Damages. Whoever violates any of the provisions of this subtitle shall, in addition to any penalties provided for such violation, be liable for any: investigation cost, cost to correct or any other cost expense; loss or damage incurred by the City; plus a charge of 15% for administrative costs. This subtitle does not establish a cause of action that may be asserted by any party other than the City. Penalties, damages, costs and expenses may be recovered only by the City.

 E. Effect of Payment of Penalties. The responsible party named in a Notice of Violation or order is not relieved of the duty to correct the violation by paying civil penalties.

 22.808.060 Collection of Costs and Penalties

 A. Invoice and Demand for Payment of Investigation and Correction Costs. The Director may issue an invoice and demand for payment of the City's costs and expenses when the Director has investigated or corrected a violation of this subtitle. The invoice shall include:

5. Notice that interest shall accrue on the unpaid balance if not paid within 30 days after the invoice date.  B. Invoice and Demand for Payment of Civil Penalties. The Director may issue an invoice and demand for payment of civil penalties when the responsible party has failed to pay a penalty by the deadline in a Notice of Violation or order and has failed to request a Director's review or file an appeal within the required time periods established in subsection 22.808.030.D. The invoice shall include:

1. The amount of the penalty;  2. Either a legal description of the property corresponding as nearly as possible to that used for the property on the rolls of the King County Assessor or, where available, the property's street address;

 3. Notice that if the amount due is not paid within 30 days, the unpaid amount may be collected in any of the manners identified in subsection 22.808.060.C and

 4. Notice that interest shall accrue on the unpaid balance if not paid within 30 days after the invoice date.

 C. Collection Following a Judicial Review. If a court has issued an order or judgment imposing penalties, costs, damages, or expenses for a violation of this subtitle, and the court's order or judgment is not appealed within 30 days, the Director may:

 1. Refer the matter to the City Attorney to initiate appropriate enforcement action;

 2. Refer, after consultation with the City Attorney, the matter to a collection agency; or

 3. Add a surcharge in the amount owed under the order to the bill for drainage and wastewater services to the site. If unpaid, the surcharge may become a lien on the property, may be foreclosed, and may accrue interest as provided by state law or Section 21.33.110.

 22.808.070 Public Nuisance

 A. Abatement Required. A public nuisance affecting drainage water, drainage, erosion control, grading and other public nuisances set forth in this subsection are violations of this subtitle. A responsible party shall immediately abate a public nuisance upon becoming aware of its existence.

 B. Dysfunctional Facility or Practice. Any private drainage control facility or best management practice not installed or maintained as required by this subtitle, or otherwise found to be in a state of dysfunction creating, a threat to the public health, safety or welfare, the environment, or public or private property is a public nuisance.

 C. Obstruction of Watercourse. Obstruction of a watercourse without authorization by the Director, and obstruction in such a manner as to increase the risk of flooding or erosion should a storm occur, is a public nuisance.

 D. Dangerous Conditions. Any condition relating to grading, drainage water, drainage or erosion which creates a present or imminent danger, or which is likely to create a danger in the event of a storm, to the public health, safety or welfare, the environment, or public or private property is a public nuisance.

 E. Abatement by the City. The Director is authorized, but not required to investigate a condition that the Director suspects of being a public nuisance under this subtitle, and to abate any public nuisance. If a public nuisance is an immediate threat to the public health, safety or welfare or to the environment, the Director may summarily and without prior notice abate the condition. The Director shall give notice of the abatement to the responsible party as soon as reasonably possible after the abatement.

 F. Collection of Abatement Costs. The costs of abatement may be collected from the responsible party, including, a reasonable charge for attorney time, and a 15% surcharge for administrative expenses as set forth in subsection 22.808.050.D. Abatement costs and other damages, expenses and penalties collected by the City shall go into an abatement account for the department collecting the moneys. The money in the abatement account shall be used for abatements, investigations, and corrections of violations performed by the City. When the account is insufficient the Director may use other available funds.

 22.808.080 Additional Relief

 In addition to any remedy provided in this subtitle, the Director may seek any other legal or equitable remedy to enjoin any acts or practice or abate any condition that or will constitute a violation of this subtitle or a public nuisance.

 22.808.090 Suspension or Revocation

 Approvals or permits granted on the basis of inaccurate or misleading information may be suspended or revoked. Other permits or approvals interrelated with an approval suspended or revoked under this subsection, including certificates of occupancy or approvals for occupancy, may also be suspended or revoked. When an approval or permit is suspended or revoked, the Director may require the applicant take corrective action to bring the project into compliance with this subtitle by a deadline set by the Director, or may take other enforcement action.

 22.808.100 Fees

 Fees for grading permits, drainage control plan review and approvals shall be as identified in the Fee Subtitle, Subtitle IX of Title 22, Seattle Municipal Code. Fees for record-keeping or other activities pursuant to this subtitle shall, unless otherwise provided for in this subtitle, be prescribed by ordinance.

 22.808.110 Financial Assurance and Covenants

 As a condition precedent to issuance of any permit or approval provided for in this subtitle, the Director may require an applicant for a permit or approval to submit financial assurances as provided in this subsection.

 A. Insurance.

1. The Director may require the property owners or contractor carry liability and property damage insurance naming the City as an additional insured. The amount, as determined by the Director, shall be commensurate with the risks.

2. The Director may also require the property owner maintain a policy of general public liability insurance against personal injury, death, property damage and/or loss from activities conducted pursuant to the permit or approval, or conditions caused by such activities, and naming the City as an additional insured. The amount, as determined by the Director, shall be commensurate with the risks. It shall cover a period of not more than ten years from the date of issuance of a certificate of occupancy or finalization of the permit or approval. A certificate evidencing such insurance shall be filed with the Director before issuing a certificate of occupancy or finalizing a permit for any single family dwelling or duplex.

3. The insurance policy shall provide that the City will be notified of cancellation of the policy at least 30 days prior to cancellation. The notice shall be sent to the Director who required the insurance and shall state the insured's name and the property address. If a property owner's insurance is canceled and not replaced, the permit or approval and any interrelated permit or approval may be revoked, including a certificate of occupancy or approval for occupancy.  B. Bonds, Cash Deposits or Instruments of Credit.

1. Surety Bond.

a. The Director may require that the property owners or contractor deliver to the Director for filing in the Office of the City Clerk a surety bond, cash deposit or an instrument of credit in such form and amounts deemed by the Director to be necessary to ensure that requirements of the permit or approval are met. A surety bond may be furnished only by a surety company licensed to do business in The State of Washington. The bond shall be conditioned that the work will be completed in accordance with the conditions of the permit or approval, or, if the work is not completed, that the site will be left in a safe condition. The bond shall also be conditioned that the site and nearby, adjacent or surrounding areas will be restored if damaged or made unsafe by activities conducted pursuant to the permit or approval.

b. The bond will be exonerated one year after a determination by the Director that the requirements of the permit or approval have been met. For work under a building permit, issuance of a certificate of occupancy or approval for occupancy following a final inspection shall be considered to be such a determination.

2. Assurance in Lieu of Surety Bond. In lieu of a surety bond, the owners may elect to file a cash deposit or instrument of credit with the Director in an amount equal to that which would be required in the surety bond and in a form approved by the Director. The cash deposit or instrument of credit shall comply with the same conditions as required for surety bonds.  C. Covenants.

1. The Director may require a covenant between the property owners and the City. The covenant shall be signed by the owners of the site and notarized prior to issuing any permit or approval in a potential landslide area, potentially hazardous location, flood prone zone, or other area of potentially hazardous soils or drainage or erosion conditions. The covenant shall not be required where the permit or approval is for work done by the City. The covenant shall include:  a. A legal description of the property;

 b. A description of the property condition making this subsection applicable;

 c. A statement that the owners of the property understands and accepts the responsibility for the risks associated with development on the property given the described condition, and agrees to inform future purchasers and other successors and assignees of the risks;

 d. The application date, type, and number of the permit or approval for which the covenant is required; and

 e. A statement waiving the right of the owners, the owners' heirs, successors and assigns, to assert any claim against the City by reason of or arising out of issuance of the permit or approval by the City for the development on the property, except only for such losses that may directly result from the sole negligence of the City.

2. The covenant shall be filed by the Director with the King County Recorder's Office, at the expense of the owners, so as to become part of the King County real property records.

 Section 5. When a permit application for a project within the scope of this ordinance is pending on the effective date of this ordinance, this ordinance applies unless 1) the City has made a written determination on any part of the permit application under the provisions of the Seattle Municipal Code Sections 22.800 through 22.802 and 22.808 prior to their amendment by this ordinance, including granting an exception under those Sections, 2) the application is vested under currently applicable law to previous regulation, or 3) the Seattle Municipal Code or a City ordinance provides otherwise. An applicant for a permit that is not subject to the provisions of this ordinance may ask the City to review the entire application under the provisions of this ordinance.

 Section 6. The provisions of this ordinance are hereby declared to be separate and severable. The invalidity of any clause, sentence, paragraph, subdivision, subsection or portion of this ordinance or the invalidity of the application thereof to any person or circumstance shall not affect the validity of the remainder of this ordinance or the validity of its application to other persons or circumstances.

 Section 7. To the extent that sections of this ordinance recodify or incorporate into new or different sections provisions of the Seattle Municipal Code as previously in effect, this ordinance shall be construed to continue such provisions in effect. The repeal of various sections of Title 22 of the Seattle Municipal Code by this ordinance shall not relieve any person of the obligation to comply with the terms and conditions of any permit issued pursuant to the provisions of such title as in effect prior to such repeal, nor shall it relieve any person or property of any obligations, conditions, or restrictions in any agreement of instrument made or granted pursuant to, or with reference to, the provisions of such Title in effect prior to such repeal.

 Section 8. This ordinance shall take effect and be in force on the latest of: (1) sixty days from and after its approval by the Mayor, or if not approved and returned by the Mayor within ten (10) days after presentation, 60 days from the date when it would take effect as provided by Municipal Code Section 1.04.020; (2) the date when CB 116616 (revising grading regulations) takes effect, or would be effective contingent only on the effectiveness of this ordinance and CB 116615 (amending cross references to the grading and stormwater regulations in the Seattle Municipal Code); and (3) the date when CB 116615 (amending cross references to the grading and stormwater regulations in the Seattle Municipal Code) takes effect, or would be effective contingent only on the effectiveness of this ordinance and CB 116616 (revising grading regulations). The intent is that all three ordinances will take effect at the same time.).
