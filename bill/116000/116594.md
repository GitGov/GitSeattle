 Form Last Revised on December 17, 2008 1

 Attachment 1

 AGREEMENT

 THIS AGREEMENT is entered into between King County, a municipal corporation and political subdivision of the State of Washington, hereinafter referred to as "King County," and The City of Seattle, a Washington municipal corporation, hereinafter referred to as "Seattle", each being a unit of general local government of the State of Washington.

 RECITALS

 WHEREAS, in 2007 the King County Housing and Community Development Program awarded funding for the SOPI Village affordable housing project, located at 13th Avenue SW and SW 100th Street in White Center in unincorporated King County and hereinafter referred to as the "Project," to the Delridge Neighborhoods Development Association ("DNDA"); and

 WHEREAS, the Project forms a key part of the White Center Community Development Agency's Strength of Place Initiative, a neighborhood wide planning effort dedicated to preserving income diversity in a rapidly gentrifying area of unincorporated King County; and

 WHEREAS, low-income housing tax credit equity is needed as a major source of funding for the Project, and DNDA concluded that a joint venture is necessary to secure a low-income tax credit equity investor; and

 WHEREAS, DNDA desires to partner with Capitol Hill Housing Improvement Program ("CHHIP"), a public corporation chartered by The City of Seattle, which is a development entity with financial resources and a proven track record, to secure a tax credit investment and complete development of the Project; and

 WHEREAS, DNDA and CHHIP have reached an agreement for CHHIP to act as the lead developer for the Project; and

 WHEREAS, CHHIP is a public corporation established under SMC Chapter 3.110; and

 WHEREAS, Seattle Municipal Code, Section 3.110.170, states in part: "If authorized by its charter to do so, a public corporation may undertake projects and activities or perform acts outside the limits of the City only in those areas of another jurisdiction whose governing body by agreement with the City consents thereto," and the CHHIP Charter so authorizes;

 WHEREAS, both King County and Seattle desire to facilitate CHHIP's participation in the SOPI Village project, to provide needed affordable housing; and

 WHEREAS, by Ordinance _________ the City Council of Seattle authorized the Director of the Office of Housing of Seattle to enter into this agreement with King County to enable CHHIP to help develop the Project;

 NOW, THEREFORE, IN CONSIDERATION OF THE FOREGOING CIRCUMSTANCES, THE PARTIES AGREE AS FOLLOWS:

 1. Consents

 King County and Seattle each consents to Capitol Hill Housing Improvement Program ("CHHIP"), a public corporation chartered by Seattle, developing an affordable housing project located outside the City of Seattle in unincorporated King County, which may include, without limitation, participating in the financing, ownership, and operation of the project. The project is known as the SOPI Village project, to be located at 13th Avenue SW and SW 100th Street ("Project"). The consent provided in this Agreement is intended to satisfy the conditions of SMC 3.110.170 and the Charter of CHHIP for actions outside the City of Seattle, and does not constitute approval of required revisions to existing funding agreements between King County and DNDA to reflect CHHIP's participation in the SOPI Village project.

 2. Powers and Authority

 Pursuant to RCW Section 35.21.740, King County and Seattle agree that with respect to all activities of CHHIP related to the Project and all related property interests now or hereafter held by CHHIP, the powers, authorities and rights of Seattle to establish, to confer power and authority upon, and to exercise authority over, a public corporation or authority, as expressly or impliedly granted pursuant to RCW Sections 35.21.730 through 35.21.755, shall be operable, applicable and effective in unincorporated King County, so that CHHIP shall have the same powers, authority and rights with respect to such activities as CHHIP has within the corporate limits of the City of Seattle, and shall be subject to the same Seattle ordinances and authority of Seattle.

 3. Duration

 This Agreement and the consents herein shall take effect when both parties have signed this Agreement, and shall remain in effect so long as the corporate existence of CHHIP continues, unless and until modified or terminated by written agreement of King County and Seattle, but no such modification or termination shall affect the validity or binding effect of any agreement or action previously made or taken by CHHIP.

 4. Miscellaneous

 This Agreement represents the entire agreement of the parties with respect to the subject matter hereof. Nothing in this Agreement shall impose any obligation, liability or responsibility on King County or Seattle for any liability, action or omission of CHHIP.
