 Version #1a

 AGREEMENT

 REGARDING DISPOSITION OF LIBRARY CAPITAL ASSETS

 IN THE EVENT OF CERTAIN ANNEXATIONS

 This AGREEMENT REGARDING THE DISPOSITION OF LIBRARY CAPITAL ASSETS IN THE EVENT OF CERTAIN ANNEXATIONS (this "Agreement"), is made by and between the KING COUNTY RURAL LIBRARY DISTRICT, doing business as the King County Library System ("KCLS"), a Washington rural county library district, and THE CITY OF SEATTLE, WASHINGTON, a municipal corporation of the State of Washington ("the City").

 RECITALS

 WHEREAS, KCLS provides library services to the citizens of unincorporated King County, Washington (the "County"), and those cities and towns within King County that have chosen to annex into KCLS; and

 WHEREAS, the City, located within the County, has not annexed into KCLS, but provides library services to its citizens; and

 WHEREAS, the City has identified the unincorporated North Highline Potential Annexation Area, identified in Exhibit A hereto, as an area all or portions of which might be annexed into the City, subject to the approval of the registered voters in those areas, respectively, as provided by law; and

 WHEREAS, any such successful annexation by the City would have the effect of removing the annexed area from the jurisdiction of KCLS, and increasing the area and population served by the City's libraries; and

 WHEREAS, KCLS and the City now desire to memorialize their agreements regarding the transfer of library capital assets in the event of any such annexation in order to maintain the past, present and future library capital investments by the citizens of the affected areas in a manner that will ensure their continued access to appropriate library services;

 NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of their mutual agreements set forth herein, KCLS and the City hereby agree as follows:

 1. Transfer of Assets. In the event of any successful annexation of any portion of the North Highline Potential Annexation Area by the City, the following shall occur:

 (a) KCLS shall pay to the City an amount equal to the product of (i) two million dollars ($2,000,000) multiplied by (ii) a fraction the numerator of which is the assessed value of the property located within the annexed area and the denominator of which is the total assessed value of all property located within the North Highline Potential Annexation Area. The City agrees to use these funds solely for the purpose of library services in the annexed area.

 (b) KCLS shall transfer title to all KCLS library buildings located within the annexed area and the real property on which they are located to the City without further consideration and free of all encumbrances.

 2. Timing of Payments and Transfers.

 (a) Subject to the provisions of Section 2(b) of this Agreement, the amount due from KCLS to the City, as described in Section 1(a) of this Agreement, shall be due and payable, as follows, at the option of KCLS:

 (i) In a single payment due on the June 1 or December 1, whichever comes first, that is at least six months following the effective date of such annexation; or

 (ii) In four, equal, semiannual installments, together with interest thereon at the net monthly rate paid by the King County Investment Pool on the unpaid balance from the date of the initial installment (computed on the basis of a 360-day year comprised of twelve 30-day months), on June 1 and December 1 of each year, commencing with the June 1 or December 1, whichever comes first, that is at least six months following the effective date of such annexation.

 (b) The transfer of library buildings and real property from KCLS to the City shall occur on the June 1 or December 1, whichever comes first, that is at least six months following the effective date of such annexation.

 3. Dispute Resolution. If a dispute arises between KCLS and the City concerning the performance of any provision of this Agreement or the interpretation thereof, and KCLS and the City are unable to resolve their differences through informal discussions, the parties will endeavor to settle the dispute by mediation under such mediation rules as shall be agreeable to the parties. Such mediation will be non-binding but a condition precedent to having the dispute resolved pursuant to litigation.

 In the event any action is brought to enforce any provision of this Agreement, the parties agree to be subject to exclusive jurisdiction in the King County Superior Court, and agree that in any such action venue shall lie exclusively in King County.

 4. Duration of Agreement. This Agreement shall become effective upon signatures of both parties and, if one or more of the contemplated annexations are approved by the voters of the affected area(s) by December 31, 2015, shall remain in full force and effect until the date of payment of the last amount due to be paid hereunder; provided, that, notwithstanding the foregoing, if no such annexation is approved by the voters of the affected area(s) by December 31, 2015, then this Agreement shall terminate, and shall be of no further force and effect after that date.

 5. Relationship of the Parties. The parties to this Agreement are independent and nothing in this Agreement is intended to create a partnership, joint venture or other mutual undertaking between the parties.

 6. No Assignment. The terms, covenants and conditions set forth in this Agreement shall be deemed personal to the parties hereto and may not be assigned or transferred to any other person.

 7. No Third-Party Beneficiaries. This Agreement is solely for the benefit of the parties hereto, and no third party shall be entitled to claim or enforce any rights hereunder except as specifically provided herein.

 8. Severability. In the event any part of this Agreement is declared void or invalid, the remaining portions of this Agreement shall not be affected, but shall remain in full force and effect.

 9. Modification. The obligations of the parties to this Agreement may not be modified, amended or waived except by written agreement executed by both parties.

 10. Notices. All notices, demands or other communications required or permitted to be given pursuant to the provisions of this Agreement shall be in writing and shall be considered as properly given if delivered personally or sent by United States Postal Service first class or overnight express mail or by overnight commercial courier service, postage and other charges prepaid. Notices so sent shall be effective three days after mailing, if mailed by first class mail, and otherwise upon receipt at the address set forth below; provided, however, that non-receipt of any communication as the result of any change of address of which the sending party was not notified or as the result of a refusal to accept delivery shall be deemed receipt of such communication, if addressed as follows, or as later designated in writing:
