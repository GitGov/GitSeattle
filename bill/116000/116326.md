 AN ORDINANCE relating to taxicabs and for-hire vehicles; making the current mandatory digital security camera equipment requirement a permanent safety feature for all licensed taxicabs; adding a new permanent mandatory digital security camera equipment requirement for all for-hire vehicles; and amending Section 6.310.320 of the Seattle Municipal Code.

 WHEREAS, driving a taxicab is identified as a high risk occupation for workplace violence by the Occupation Safety and Health Administration, and a 2004 comprehensive study on Seattle taxicab driver personal safety by the Taxicab Advisory Group recommended that additional safety equipment be required for all taxicabs, including digital security cameras; and

 WHEREAS, Ordinance 121738 was adopted in 2005 requiring all taxicabs operating in Seattle to be equipped with operational digital security cameras; and

 WHEREAS, according to Seattle Police Department crime statistics, robbery crimes against taxicab drivers were reduced from 13.8 per year during the period 2000-2005 before digital security cameras were installed, to 5.0 per year during the period 2006-2007 after digital security cameras were installed, for a reduction of 63.8% in "planned" crimes thus demonstrating the effectiveness of the mandatory security cameras in preventing such crimes against taxicab drivers; and

 WHEREAS, digital security cameras have proved very effective in the arrest and prosecution of suspects in taxicab crimes as demonstrated by a recent conviction in King County Superior Court for a notorious murder-arson crime where the images recorded during the crime were the key evidence presented to the jury; and

 WHEREAS, the recent licensing of a small fleet of for-hire vehicles has made it necessary to extend the protection provided by digital security cameras to drivers of for-hire vehicles who are subject to the same occupational risks as drivers of taxicabs; and

 WHEREAS, the City recognizes the importance of making the current digital security camera requirement a permanent safety feature for all taxicabs operating within the city and also establishing a new permanent digital security camera safety requirement for all for-hire vehicles operating within the city; NOW, THEREFORE,

 BE IT ORDAINED BY THE CITY OF SEATTLE AS FOLLOWS:

 Section 1. Section 6.310.320 of the Seattle Municipal Code is amended as follows:

 6.310.320 Taxicab and for-hire vehicle - Vehicle operating requirements.

 No taxicab or for-hire vehicle, unless otherwise specifically provided herein, licensed by the City may lawfully operate within ~~T~~the ~~C~~city of Seattle unless the following minimum vehicle requirements are met:

 ***

 S. The taxicab and for-hire vehicle must be equipped with an operable digital security camera system approved by the Director pursuant to specifications provided by rule and adopted by the Director (summary suspension and Class B). ~~The requirement for digital security cameras will expire on March 1, 2009, unless the City of Seattle adopts an ordinance to extend the requirement.~~ All for-hire vehicles must be in compliance with this provision by March 1, 2009. Access to images made by any digital security camera is restricted to law enforcement personnel solely for the investigation and prosecution of crimes (Class C). Nothing in this subsection S shall be construed to remove a law enforcement agency's obligation to comply with the Fourth Amendment of the United States Constitution and article I, section 7 of the Washington Constitution in obtaining access to digital security camera images, including the requirement to obtain a search warrant if needed;

 ***

 Section 2. If the amendment to Seattle Municipal Code 6.310.320 submitted by Council Bill No. 116210 is also enacted into law, then both the amendment to Seattle Municipal Code 6.310.320 in Council Bill No. 116210 and the amendments to Seattle Municipal Code 6.310.320 in this ordinance shall be coordinated and given effect.

 Section 3. This ordinance shall take effect and be in force thirty (30) days from and after its approval by the Mayor, but if not approved and returned by the Mayor within ten (10) days after presentation, it shall take effect as provided by Municipal Code Section 1.04.020.
