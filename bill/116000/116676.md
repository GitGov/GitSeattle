On November 21, 2008, Owner applied for a contract rezone of the Property from SF-7200 to either Neighborhood Commercial 2 or Neighborhood Commercial 3 with a 40-foot height limit (NC2-40 or NC3-40). Both the Department of Planning & Development and the Hearing Examiner recommended approval of a rezone to NC3-40.

 C. Seattle Municipal Code ("SMC") 23.34.004 allows the City to approve a contract rezone subject to subject to the execution, delivery and recording of an agreement executed by the legal or beneficial owner of the property to be rezoned to self-imposed restrictions upon the use and development of the property in order to ameliorate adverse impacts that could occur from unrestricted use and development permitted by development regulations otherwise applicable after the rezone.

 NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the mutual agreements contained herein, the parties agree as follows:

 Section 1. Agreement. Pursuant to Seattle Municipal Code 23.34.004, Owner hereby covenants, bargains and agrees, on behalf of itself and its successors and assigns, that it will comply with the following limitations and conditions in consideration of the rezone of the Property from Single- Family 7200 (SF-7200) to Neighborhood Commercial 3 with a 40-foot height limit (NC3-40).

 1. Owner will construct the proposed Safeway store substantially in compliance with the final approved Master Use Permit plans dated May 29, 2009, as amended June 12, 2009. This substantial compliance shall include but not be limited to the details of structure design, structure height, building materials, landscaping, street improvements, parking lot design and layout, signage and site lighting.

 Section 2. Agreement Runs With the Land. This Property Use and Development Agreement (hereinafter "Agreement") shall be recorded in the records of King County by the City Clerk. The covenants hereof shall be deemed to attach to and run with the land and shall be binding upon the Owner, its heirs, successors and assigns, and shall apply to after- acquired title of the Owner of the Property.

 Section 3. Termination. These covenants and the rezone shall expire two years from the effective date of approval, unless, within the two year period, an application is filed for a Master Use Permit for the Property, which permit is subsequently issued. The rezone remains in effect unless revoked pursuant to Section 23.34.004.

 Section 4. Amendment. This Agreement may be amended or modified by agreement between Owners and the City; provided, such amendment agreement shall be approved by the legislative authority of the City by ordinance.

 Section 5. Exercise of Police Power. Nothing in this Agreement shall prevent the City Council from making such further amendments to the Seattle Municipal Code or Land Use Code as it may deem necessary in the public interest.

 Section 6. No Precedent. The conditions contained in this Agreement are based on the unique circumstances applicable to this Property and this Agreement is not intended to establish precedent for other rezones in the surrounding area.

 Section 7. Benefited. This Agreement is made for the benefit of the City and for the benefit of the owners of property within 300 feet of the Property and either the City or any such property owners may institute and prosecute any proceeding at law or in equity to enforce this Agreement.

 Section 8. Repeal as Additional Remedy. Owner acknowledges that compliance with the conditions of this Agreement is a condition of the subject rezone and that if Owner avails itself of the benefits of this rezone but then fails to comply with the conditions of this Agreement with the City, in addition to pursuing any other remedy, the City may revoke the rezone by ordinance and require the use of the Property to conform to the requirements of the SF-7200 zone.
