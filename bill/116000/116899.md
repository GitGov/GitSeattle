 AN ORDINANCE relating to the Department of Parks and Recreation; authorizing the acquisition of real property located on 8th Avenue between Marion and Columbia Streets, otherwise known as Lot 4 Block 71, Terry's First Addition to the Town of Seattle, according to the plat thereof recorded in Volume 1 of Plats, page 49, in King County, Washington and; authorizing acceptance and recording of the deed for open space, park, and recreation purposes; and authorizing acquisition by condemnation.

 WHEREAS, the Neighborhood Parks, Green Spaces, Trails and Zoo Levy ("2000 Parks Levy"), as proposed by Ordinance 120024 and approved by City of Seattle ("City") voters on November 7, 2000, provides funds for the acquisition of new neighborhood parks and green spaces; and

 WHEREAS, Ordinance 120024 identified a specific parcel of real property for the First Hill Park Acquisition project, but the City was not successful in acquiring that parcel; and

 WHEREAS, in Resolution 31055 the Council created the Parks and Green Spaces Levy Citizens' Advisory Committee to ensure citizen participation in the development of a potential package of parks, open space, boulevards, trails, green infrastructure, and recreation projects and a proposed set of options to fund the package; and

 WHEREAS, the Parks and Green Spaces Levy Citizens' Advisory Committee, after being duly appointed and after spending many hours in open meetings and receiving public testimony and deliberating on the levy, voted by a strong majority to recommend that the City Council place a $145.5 million six-year levy proposal for park purposes before the voters of Seattle; and

 WHEREAS, in response to this recommendation, the City Council passed Ordinance 122749, placing Proposition 2, the 2008 Parks and Green Spaces Levy before the voters of Seattle; and

 WHEREAS, Ordinance 122749 identifies the First Hill Urban Center Village for a potential neighborhood park acquisition; and

 WHEREAS, the Department of Parks and Recreation considers the First Hill Urban Center Village as significantly underserved with quality open space and is, therefore, a priority for additional development of parks and open space; and

 WHEREAS, a site located on 8th Avenue between Marion and Columbia Streets is well-suited for open space, park, and recreation uses; and

 WHEREAS, the City has determined that the property on 8th Avenue between Marion and Columbia Streets will provide a new neighborhood park that meets the criteria to address open space needs established in Seattle's Park and Recreation Comprehensive Plan, Seattle's Parks and Recreation Plan 2000, and Seattle's 2006 Open Space Gap Report Update, that it is in the public's best interest to acquire the same for open space, park, and recreation purposes; NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT ORDAINED BY THE CITY OF SEATTLE AS FOLLOWS: Section 1.
