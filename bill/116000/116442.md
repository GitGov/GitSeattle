 SPU Lane Case Surcharge ORD

 Version 7

 Form Last Revised on December 31, 2007 2

 CB 116442, CB 116456, and CB 116457

 Hydrant Water Rate Surcharge, Utility Tax, and General Subfund Appropriation

 Divided Report

 For Consideration at Full Council on Tuesday February 17, 2009

 In late 2008, the Washington Supreme Court ruled that the City's General Subfund (GF) must repay Seattle Public Utilities (SPU) for fire hydrant costs included in water bills from March 1, 2002 through December 2004. The Court also directed SPU to use the GF payment to make refunds to water customers. The ruling is implemented through a December 2008 Superior Court order (the "Order").

 To comply with the Order, the Executive proposed a temporary water rate increase (called a surcharge) that would fund a temporary utility tax increase and other SPU costs associated with the Order. As originally proposed in C.B. 116442, the 143% surcharge would collect $22.7 million in March-April 2009. The surcharge would cover SPU Order-related costs including C.B. 116441's 9.21% increase in the City water utility tax for May-December 2009.

 To separate the tax and GF appropriation decisions, the Finance and Budget (F&B) Committee directed that C.B. 116441 be replaced with a utility tax ordinance (C.B. 116457) and a GF appropriation ordinance (C.B. 116456). The F&B Committee also narrowed the alternatives to the Executive proposal down to two options. The Committee approved an option which imposes a 10.2% surcharge that collects $21.2 million from March 31, 2009 through December 31, 2010. The surcharge covers a utility tax increase to 19.87% which generates $14.4 million in GF revenue. It also covers $6.8 million of other SPU Order-related costs which is a $1.5 million reduction compared to the Executive proposal. This option required amendments to both the surcharge ordinance (C.B. 116442) and the utility tax ordinance (C.B. 116457). The option also required approval of the GF appropriation ordinance (C.B. 116456).

 The F&B Committee had a divided report on the amended C.B. 116442 (with version 7 reflecting Committee amendments), the amended C.B. 116457 (with version 2 reflecting Committee amendments), and C.B. 116456 version 1:

 Yes 6 (Burgess, Clark, Conlin, Godden, McIver, Rasmussen)

 No 1 (Harrell)

 The reports on this legislation are as follows:

 Yes on CB 116442 (as amended), CB 116457 (as amended) and C.B. 116456:

 Until January 1, 2005, the City funded fire hydrant services through water rates as did many other Washington cities. Since that time, SPU has billed the General Subfund (GF) and other general government customers for hydrant services. The City made these funding changes quickly after the results of the Okeson street lights lawsuit were known.

 Despite its efforts to pay for hydrants with appropriate funding sources, the City has been ordered by the court to make hydrant- related refunds and payments. Yet City GF and Water Fund revenues were fully allocated in the 2009 budget. Resources to comply with the Order can only be gained through new revenues (such as the surcharge and utility tax increase) or reduced spending on other GF and Water Fund services.

 With the slow economy the GF is already facing a large 2009 revenue shortfall that may drive significant service cuts later this year. Because the Council must decide to issue this refund in this challenging economic climate, the Committee weighed several factors to balance the impacts on rate payers while maintaining the financial health of the utility. The Committee believed it could do this by reducing impacts to rate payers through SPU spending reductions of $1.5 million. To maintain the financial health of the Water Fund, however, the Council's hydrant decision should not include further cuts to SPU services or revenues.

 No on CB 116442 (as amended), CB 116457 (as amended) and C.B. 116456:

 In today's economic climate, many Seattle rate payers are struggling to make ends meet. Our primary emphasis in addressing the legal liability that this legislation is addressing, should be how we lessen the financial impact to ratepayers, small and large businesses, and those rate payers who have already been asked to pay more for their water service in the next three years. Even without a surcharge, water rates increased in 2009 and will increase again in 2010 and 2011, so that typical bills in 2011 will be 38.2% higher than in 2008. Raising water rates even more should not be considered without first looking for spending reductions that could be achieved through efficiencies in the City's businesses practices to deal with a short term cash need, organizational design, and temporary delays in certain capital projects. The GF is facing a significant 2009 revenue shortfall beyond any shortfall arising from the hydrant Order and the hydrant-related GF spending cuts should be part of that broader discussion.

 Although efficiencies and spending reductions must be found, some new revenues (including a surcharge and temporary tax increase) are needed to make hydrant refunds and payments in the court-ordered time frame. To be fair to the ratepayer, the revenue raised by a surcharge should not exceed the amount refunded to water customers under the court order, necessitating a 7.3% surcharge as opposed to the 10.2% surcharge in the F&B Committee-recommended version of CB 116442. By limiting surcharge revenue collection to $15.2 million, impacts on customers' water bills can be reduced during these tough economic times and the Council can then examine its legislative priorities and develop short and long term solutions to the immediate need of paying for this legal liability.
