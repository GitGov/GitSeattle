 (Representing the Supervisory Employees)

 June 11, 2008 through December 31, 2010

 THIS AGREEMENT is by and between the CITY OF SEATTLE/MUNICIPAL COURT, hereinafter referred to as the Employer, and PUBLIC, PROFESSIONAL & OFFICE-CLERICAL EMPLOYEES AND DRIVERS LOCAL UNION NO. 763, affiliated with the International Brotherhood of Teamsters, hereinafter referred to as the Union.

 Aspects of employment at Seattle Municipal Court that are related to wages and wage-related benefits are within the legal authority of the City of Seattle. Aspects of employment at Seattle Municipal Court that are not related to wages and wage-related benefits are within the legal authority of Seattle Municipal Court.

 ARTICLE 1 - RECOGNITION, BARGAINING UNIT AND TEMPORARY EMPLOYMENT

 1.1 Recognition and Bargaining Unit - The Employer recognizes the Union as the exclusive collective bargaining representative for the purpose stated in Chapter 108, Extra Session Laws of 1967 of the State of Washington, for the collective bargaining unit described in the decision emanating from the Washington State Public Employment Relations Commission Case Number 21662-E-08-3357. For purposes of this Agreement and the bargaining unit described herein, the following definitions shall apply:

 1.1.1 The term "employee" shall be defined to include probationary employees, regular employees, full-time employees, part-time employees and temporary employees not otherwise excluded or limited in the following Sections of this Article.

 1.1.2 The term "probationary employee" shall be defined as an employee who is within his/her first twelve (12) month trial period of employment following his/her initial regular appointment within the classified service.

 1.1.3 The term "regular employee" shall be defined as an employee who has successfully completed a twelve (12) month probationary period and who has had no subsequent break in service as occasioned by quit, resignation, discharge for just cause, or retirement.

 1.1.4 The term "full-time employee" shall be defined as an employee who has been regularly appointed and who has a usual work schedule of forty (40) hours per week.

 1.1.5 The term "part-time employee" shall be defined as an employee who has been regularly appointed and who has a usual work schedule averaging at least twenty (20) hours but less than forty (40) hours per week on an annual basis.

 1.1.6 The terms temporary employee and temporary worker shall be defined to include both temporary and less than half time employees and means a person who is employed in:

 1. An interim assignment(s) of up to one (1) year to a vacant regular position to perform work associated with a regularly budgeted position that is temporarily vacant and has no incumbent; or

 2. An interim assignment for short-term replacement of a regular employee of up to one (1) year when the incumbent is temporarily absent; or

 3. A short-term assignment of up to one (1) year, which may be extended beyond one year only while the assignment is in the process of being converted to a regular position, to perform work that is not ongoing regular work and for which there is no regularly budgeted position; or

 4. A less than half-time assignment for seasonal, on-call, intermittent or regularly scheduled work that normally does not exceed one thousand forty (1040) hours in a year, but may be extended up to one thousand three hundred (1300) hours once every three years and may also be extended while the assignment is in the process of being converted to a regular position; or

 5. A term-limited assignment for a period of more than one but less than three (3) years for time-limited work related to a specific project, grant or other non-routine substantial body of work, or for the replacement of a regularly appointed employee when that employee is absent on long-term disability time loss, medical or military leave of absence.

 1.1.7 Temporary workers in the following types of assignments shall cease receiving premium pay at the time indicated and begin receiving wage progression and benefits as provided in SMC 4.20.055 D:

 1.1.7.1 Interim and short term assignments after one thousand forty (1,040) regular straight time hours for the remainder of the assignment unless the Personnel Director determines that the assignment will terminate so imminently that the benefits package would be of minimal value to the worker.

 1.1.7.2 Term-limited assignments starting with the first day and for the duration of the assignment.

 1.1.7.3 Any assignment that the appointing authority has proposed be converted to regular position authority regardless of the number of hours worked.

 1.2 All provisions expressed in Chapter 11.0 of the Personnel Rules shall govern the utilization and management of temporary assignments except where they are inconsistent with the expressed terms of the collective bargaining agreement.

 1.3 Temporary Employment - Temporary employees shall be exempt from all provisions of this Agreement except Sections 1.2; 1.2.1; 1.2.2;1.2.2.1; 1.2.2.2; 1.2.3; 1.2.4; 1.2.5; 1.2.6; 1.2.7; 1.2.8; 1.2.9; 1.2.10; 3.1.1; 5.2; 5.6; and Article 20, Grievance Procedure; provided however, temporary employees shall be covered by the Grievance Procedure solely for purposes of adjudicating grievances relating to Sections identified within this Section. Where the provisions in Personnel Rule 11 do not conflict with the expressed provisions of this Agreement, the Personnel Rule 11 shall apply and be subject to the grievance procedure as provided for in Article 20.

 1.3.1 Temporary employees who are not in benefits-eligible assignments shall be paid for all hours worked at the first Pay Step of the hourly rates of pay set forth within the appropriate Appendix "A" covering the classification of work in which he/she is employed. Temporary employees who are in a benefits-eligible assignment shall receive step increases consistent with Article 4.3.1., 4.3.4. and 4.3.5.

 1.3.2 Temporary Employee Premium Pay for Employees Who are not in Benefits-Eligible Assignments - Each temporary employee shall receive premium pay as hereinafter set forth based upon the corresponding number of cumulative non-overtime hours worked by the temporary employee unless the employee is in a benefits-eligible assignment:

 0001st hour through 0520th hour 05% premium pay

 0521st hour through 1040th hour 10% premium pay

 1041st hour through 2080th hour 15% premium pay (If an employee worked 800 hours or more in the previous 12 months, he/she shall receive 20% premium pay)

 2081st hour + 20% premium pay (If an employee worked 800 hours or more in the previous 12 months, he/she shall receive 25% premium pay)

 The appropriate percentage premium payment shall be applied to all gross earnings.

 1.3.2.1 Once a temporary employee reaches a given premium level, the premium shall not be reduced for that temporary employee as long as the employee continues to work for the Employer without a voluntary break in service as set forth within Section 1.2.8. Non-overtime hours already worked by an existing temporary employee shall apply in determining the applicable premium rate. In view of the escalating and continuing nature of the premium, the Employer may require that a temporary employee be available to work for a minimum number of hours or periods of time during the year.

 1.3.2.2 The premium pay in Section 1.2.2 does not include either increased vacation pay due to accrual rate increases or the Employer's share of any retirement contributions. Any increase in a temporary employee's vacation accrual rate percentage shall be added on to the premium pay percentages for the temporary employee to whom it applies.

 1.3.3 Employee Medical And Dental Eligibility for Temporary Employees Who are not in Benefits-Eligible Positions - Once a temporary employee has worked at least one thousand forty (1040) cumulative non-overtime hours and at least eight hundred (800) non-overtime hours or more in the previous twelve (12) months, he/she may within ninety (90) calendar days thereafter elect to participate in the Employer's medical and dental insurance programs by agreeing to pay the required monthly premium. To participate the temporary employee must agree to a payroll deduction equal to the amount necessary to pay the monthly health care premiums, or the Employer, at its discretion, may reduce the premium pay of the employee who chooses this option in an amount equal to the insurance premiums. The temporary employee must continue to work enough hours each month to pay the premiums and maintain eligibility. After meeting the hours worked requirement, a temporary employee shall also be allowed to elect this option during any subsequent open period allowed regular employees. An employee who elects to participate in these insurance programs and fails to make the required payments in a timely fashion shall be dropped from Employer medical and dental coverage and shall not be able to participate again while employed by the Employer as temporary. If a temporary employee's hours of work are insufficient for his/her pay to cover the insurance premium, the temporary employee may, on no more than one occasion, pay the difference, or self-pay the insurance premium, for up to three (3) consecutive months.

 1.3.4 Holiday Work for Non-Benefits Eligible Temporary Employees - A temporary employee who works on any of the specific calendar days designated by the Employer as paid holidays shall be paid at the rate of one and one-half (1 1/2) times his/her regular straight-time hourly rate of pay for hours worked during his/her scheduled shift. When a specific holiday falls on a weekend day and most regular employees honor the holiday on the preceding Friday or following Monday adjacent to the holiday, the holiday premium pay of one and one-half (1 1/2) times the employee's regular straight-time rate of pay shall apply to those temporary employees who work on the weekend day specified as the holiday.

 1.3.5 A temporary employee who is scheduled to work regularly or on and off throughout the year and who has worked two thousand eighty (2080) cumulative non-overtime hours without a voluntary break in service and who has also worked eight hundred (800) non-overtime hours or more in the previous twelve (12) months, may request an unpaid leave of absence not to exceed the amount of vacation time he/she would have earned in the previous year if he/she had not received vacation premium pay in lieu of annual paid vacation. Where such requests are made, the timing and scheduling of such unpaid leaves must be agreeable to the employing department. The leave shall be handled in a manner similar to the scheduling of vacation for regular employees. This provision shall not be applicable in cases where a temporary employee accrues vacation time rather than premium pay as set forth within Section 1.2.7.

 1.3.6 Premium pay set forth within Section 1.2.2 shall be in lieu of the base level of vacation and all other fringe benefits, such as sick leave, holiday pay, funeral leave, military leave, jury duty pay, disability leave, and medical and dental insurance, except as otherwise provided in Sections 1.2.2.2, 1.2.3, and 1.2.4.

 1.3.7 The Employer may, at any time after ninety (90) calendar days' advance notification to and upon consultation with the Union, provide all fringe benefits covered by the premium pay set forth within Section 1.2.2 to all or some groups (departmental or occupational) of temporary employees to the same extent that they are available to regular employees within the same group, and in such event the premium pay provision in Section 1.2.2 shall no longer be applicable to that particular group of temporary employees. The Employer, at its discretion, may also after ninety (90) calendar days' advance notification to and upon consultation with the Union, provide paid vacation and/or sick leave benefits to all or some groups (departmental or occupational) of temporary employees to the same extent that they are available to regular employees without providing other fringe benefits and in such event the premium pay in Section 1.2.2 shall be reduced by a percentage amount equivalent to the value of vacation and/or sick leave benefits. The applicable amount for base-level vacation shall be recognized as four point eight one percent (4.81%) which could be higher dependent upon accrual rate increases. The applicable amount for base-level sick leave shall be four point six percent (4.6%). The Employer shall not use this option to change to and from premiums and benefits on an occasional basis. The Employer may also continue to provide benefits in lieu of all or part of the premiums in Section 1.2.2 where it has already been doing so and it may in such cases reduce the premium paid to the affected employees by the applicable percentage.

 1.3.8 The premium pay provisions set forth within Section 1.2.2 shall apply to cumulative non-overtime hours that occur without a voluntary break in service by the temporary employee. A voluntary break in service shall be defined as quit, resignation, service retirement or failure to return from an unpaid leave. If the temporary employee has not worked for at least one year (12 months or 26 pay periods) it shall be presumed that the employee's break in service was voluntary.

 1.3.9 The Employer may work temporary employees beyond one thousand forty (1040) regular hours within any twelve (12) month period; provided however, the Employer shall not use temporary employees to supplant permanent positions. The Employer shall not assign or schedule temporary employees (or fail to do so) solely to avoid accumulation of regular hours that would increase the premium pay provided for in Section 1.2.2, or solely to avoid considering creation of permanent positions.

 1.3.9.1 In the event that an interim assignment of a temporary employee to a vacant regular position accrues more than one thousand five hundred (1500) hours or accumulates hours in eighteen (18) or more consecutive pay periods, the City shall notify the union that a labor-management meeting shall take place within two (2) weeks for the purpose of discussing the status of filling the vacant position prior to one (1) year.

 1.3.10 A temporary employee who has worked in excess of five hundred twenty (520) regular hours and who is appointed to a permanent position without a voluntary break in service greater than thirty (30) days shall have his/her time worked counted for purposes of salary step placement (where appropriate). In addition, a temporary employee who is in a term- limited assignment shall receive service credit for layoff purposes if the employee is immediately hired (within thirty (30) business days without a break in service) into the same job title and position after the term is completed.

 1.3.11 Temporary employees covered by this Agreement who have worked for the City for one thousand forty (1,040) hours, without a break in service are eligible to apply for all positions advertised internally.

 1.4 The Employer may establish on-the-job training program(s) in a different classification and/or within another bargaining unit for the purpose of providing individuals an opportunity to compete and potentially move laterally and/or upward into new career fields. Prior to implementation of such a program(s) relative to bargaining unit employees, the Employer shall discuss the program(s) with the Union and the issue of bargaining unit jurisdiction and/or salary shall be a proper subject for negotiations at that time upon the request of either party.

 1.5 As part of its public responsibility, the Employer may participate in or establish public employment programs to provide employment and/or training for and/or service to the Employer by various segments of its citizenry. Such programs may result in individuals performing work for the Employer which is considered bargaining unit work pursuant to RCW 41.56. Such programs have included and may include youth training and/or employment programs, adult training and/or employment programs, vocational rehabilitation programs, work study and student intern programs, court- ordered community service programs, volunteer programs and other programs with similar purposes. Some examples of such programs already in effect include Summer Youth Employment Program (SYEP), Youth Employment Training Program (YETP), Work Study, Adopt-a-Park, Seattle Conservation Corps, and court-ordered Community Service. Individuals working for the Employer pursuant to such programs shall be exempt from all provisions of this Agreement.

 1.5.1 The Employer shall have the right to implement new public employment programs or expand its current programs beyond what exists as of the signature date of this Agreement, but where such implementation or expansion involves bargaining unit work and results in a significant departure from existing practice, the Employer shall give thirty (30) days' advance written notice to the Union of such and upon receipt of a written request from the Union thereafter, the Employer shall engage in discussions with the Union on concerns raised by the Union. Notwithstanding any provision to the contrary, the expanded use of individuals under such a public employment program which involves the performance of bargaining unit work within a given Employer department, beyond what has traditionally existed, shall not be the cause of (1) a layoff of regular employees covered by this Agreement, or (2) the abrogation of a regular budgeted full-time position covered by this Agreement which recently had been occupied by a regular full-time employee that performed the specific bargaining unit work now being or about to be performed by an individual under one of the Employer's public employment programs.

 ARTICLE 2 - NONDISCRIMINATION

 2.1 The Employer and the Union shall not unlawfully discriminate against any employee by reason of race, creed, age, color, sex, national origin, religious belief, marital status, veteran status, gender identity, sexual orientation, political ideology, ancestry or the presence of any sensory, mental or physical handicap unless based on a bona fide occupational qualification reasonably necessary to the operations of the Employer.

 2.1.1 Wherever words denoting a specific gender are used in this Agreement, they are intended and shall be construed so as to apply equally to either gender.

 2.2 Disputes involving this Article must be processed through the appropriate Local, State or Federal agency. Such disputes shall not be subject to the grievance procedure contained within this Agreement.

 2.3 The parties agree nothing in this Agreement, including seniority provisions, shall serve to prevent a job placement or other reasonable accommodation as may be made pursuant to state or federal law for prevention of discrimination on the basis of disability.

 ARTICLE 3 - UNION MEMBERSHIP, DUES AND PAYROLL DEDUCTION

 3.1 Union Membership - It shall be a condition of employment that all employees of the Employer covered by this Agreement who are members of the Union in good standing on the effective date of this Agreement shall remain members in good standing and all those who are not members of the Union on the effective date of this Agreement shall, on or before the thirtieth (30th) day following the effective date of this Agreement, become and remain members in good standing in the Union or contribute an amount equivalent to the regular monthly dues of the Union to the Union. It shall also be a condition of employment that all employees covered by this Agreement who are hired on or after its effective date shall, on or before the thirtieth (30th) day following the beginning of such employment, become and remain members in good standing in the Union or pay an amount equivalent to the regular monthly dues of the Union to the Union. Failure by any such employee to apply for and/or maintain such membership or pay an amount equivalent to the regular monthly dues of the Union in accordance with this provision shall constitute cause for discharge of such employee; provided however, the requirements to apply for Union membership and/or maintain Union membership in good standing shall be recognized as having been satisfied by an employee's payment of the regular initiation fee, regular re-initiation fee, and the regular monthly dues uniformly required by the Union of its members.

 3.1.1 A temporary employee may, in lieu of the Union membership requirements set forth within Section 3.1, pay a Union service fee in an amount equivalent to one and one-half percent (1.5%) of the total gross earnings received by the temporary employee for all hours worked within the bargaining unit each biweekly pay period, commencing with the thirty- first (31st) day following the temporary employee's first date of assignment to perform bargaining unit work.

 3.1.2 An employee who is determined by the Public Employment Relations Commission to satisfy the religious exemption requirements of RCW 41.56.122 shall contribute an amount equivalent to regular union dues and initiation fees to a non-religious charity or to another charitable organization mutually agreed upon by the employee and the Union. Such employee shall furnish proof of payment to the Union no later than the twentieth of the month in which the contribution is due.

 3.2 Dues - Failure by an employee to abide by the afore-referenced provisions of this Article shall constitute cause for discharge of such employee; provided however, it shall be the responsibility of the Union to notify the Employer in writing when it is seeking discharge of an employee for non-compliance with Sections 3.1 or 3.1.1 or 3.1.2 of this Article. When an employee fails to fulfill the union membership obligations set forth within this Article, the Union shall forward a "Request For Discharge Letter" to the Court Administrator (with copies to the employee, the Court Personnel Manager and the City Director of Labor Relations). Accompanying the Discharge Letter shall be a copy of the letter to the employee from the Union explaining the employee's obligation under Article 3, Sections 3.1 or 3.1.1 or 3.1.2.

 3.2.1 The contents of the "Request For Discharge Letter" shall specifically request the discharge of the employee for failure to abide by Sections 3.1 or 3.1.1 or 3.1.2 of Article 3, but provide the employee and the Employer with thirty (30) calendar days' written notification of the Union's intent to initiate discharge action, during which time the employee may make restitution in the amount which is overdue. Upon receipt of the Union's request, the Court Administrator shall give notice in writing to the employee, with a copy to the Union and the City Director of Labor Relations, that the employee faces discharge upon the request of the Union at the end of the thirty (30) calendar day period noted in the Union's "Request For Discharge Letter" and that the employee has an opportunity before the end of said thirty (30) calendar day period to present to the Department any information relevant to why the Department should not act upon the Union's written request for the employee's discharge.

 3.2.2 In the event the employee has not yet fulfilled the obligation set forth within Sections 3.1 or 3.1.1 or 3.1.2 of this Article within the thirty (30) calendar day period noted in the "Request For Discharge Letter", the Union shall thereafter reaffirm in writing to the Court Administrator, with copies to the employee, the Court Personnel Manager and the City Director of Labor Relations, its original written request for discharge of such employee. Unless sufficient legal explanation or reason is presented by the employee why discharge is not appropriate, or unless the Union rescinds its request for the discharge, the Employer shall, as soon as possible thereafter, effectuate the discharge of such employee. If the employee has fulfilled the union membership obligation within the thirty (30) calendar day period, the Union shall so notify the Court Administrator in writing, with a copy to the Court Personnel Manager, the City Director of Labor Relations and the employee. If the Union has reaffirmed its request for discharge, the Court Administrator shall notify the Union in writing, with a copy to the City Director of Labor Relations and the employee, that the Department effectuated the discharge and the specific date such discharge was effectuated, or that the Department has not discharged the employee, setting forth the reasons why it has not done so.

 3.3 Payroll Deduction - The Employer shall deduct from the pay check of each employee who has so authorized it, the regular initiation fee and regular monthly dues uniformly required of members of the Union or the alternative biweekly Union service fees required of temporary employees per Section 3.1.1. The amounts deducted shall be transmitted monthly to the Union on behalf of the employees involved. If an improper deduction is made, the Union shall refund directly to the employee any such amount. Authorization by the employee shall be on a form approved by the parties hereto and may be revoked by the employee upon request.

 3.4 The Union shall indemnify and save harmless the Employer against any and all liability arising out of this Article.

 3.5 Union Notification - Within thirty (30) calendar days from an employee's date of hire into a bargaining unit position, the Employer shall forward to the Union a copy of the form entitled "Notice of Appointment to Bargaining Unit Position," or such other form agreed upon by the parties, which shall include the name, address and social security number of the new employee as furnished by the employee. The Employer shall notify the Union within thirty (30) calendar days of the termination of employment by an employee in the bargaining unit.

 ARTICLE 4 - CLASSIFICATIONS AND RATES OF PAY

 4.1 The classifications of employees covered under this Agreement and the corresponding rates of pay effective December 26, 2007, are set forth within Appendix "A" which is attached hereto and made a part of this Agreement.

 4.2 Effective January 7, 2009, wages will be increased by 100% of the annual average growth rate of the bi-monthly Seattle-Tacoma-Bremerton Area Consumer Price Index for Urban Wage Earners and Clerical Workers (CPI-W) for the period August 2006 through June 2007 to the period August 2007 through June 2008.

 4.2.1 Effective January 6, 2010, wages will be increased by 100% of the annual average growth rate of the bi-monthly Seattle-Tacoma-Bremerton Area Consumer Price Index for Urban Wage Earners and Clerical Workers (CPI-W) for the period August 2007 through June 2008 to the period August 2008 through June 2009.

 4.2.2 In the event the "Consumer Price Index" becomes unavailable for purposes of computing any one of the afore-referenced increases, the parties shall jointly request the Bureau of Labor Statistics to provide a comparable index for purposes of computing such increase and if that is not satisfactory, the parties shall promptly undertake negotiations solely with respect to agreeing upon a substitute formula for determining a comparable adjustment.

 4.2.3 For 2009 and 2010, the percentage increases shall be at least two percent (2%) and not more than seven percent (7%).

 4.3 An employee, upon first appointment or assignment, shall receive the minimum rate of the salary range fixed for the position as set forth within Appendix "A" attached hereto.

 4.3.1 An employee shall be granted the first automatic step increase in salary rate upon completion of six (6) months of "actual service" when hired at the first step of the salary range, and succeeding automatic step increases shall be granted after twelve (12) months of "actual service" from the date of eligibility for the last step increase to the maximum of the range. Actual service for purposes of this Section shall be defined in terms of one month's service for each month of full-time employment, including paid absences. This provision shall not apply to temporary employees prior to regular appointment except as otherwise provided for in Section 1.2.10; and except that step increments in the out-of-class title shall be authorized when a step increase in the primary title reduces the pay differential to less than what the promotion rule permits, provided that such increment shall not exceed the top step of the higher salary range. Further, when an employee is assigned to perform out-of-class duties in the same title for a total of twelve (12) months, (each 2088 hours) of actual service, he/she will receive one step increment in the higher-paid title; provided that he/she has not received a step increment in the out-of-class title based on changes in the primary pay rate within the previous twelve (12) months, and that such increment does not exceed the top step of the higher salary range. However, hours worked out-of- class, that were properly paid per Article 5.9 of this Agreement, shall apply toward salary step placement if the employee's position is reclassified to the same title as the out-of-class assignment within twelve (12) months of the end of such assignment.

 4.3.2 Those employees who have been given step increases for periodic "work outside of classification" prior to the effective date of this Agreement shall continue at that step but shall not be given credit for future step increases, except as provided for in Section 4.3.1.

 4.3.3 For employees assigned salary steps other than the beginning step of the salary range, subsequent salary increases within the salary range shall be granted after twelve (12) months of "actual service" from the appointment or increase, then at succeeding twelve (12) month intervals to the maximum of the salary range established for the class.

 4.3.4 In determining "actual service" for advancement in salary step, absence due to sickness or injury for which the employee does not receive compensation may, at the discretion of the Employer, be credited at the rate of thirty (30) calendar days per year. Unpaid absences due to other causes may, at the discretion of the Employer, be credited at the rate of fifteen (15) calendar days per year. For the purposes of this Section, time lost by reason of disability for which an employee is compensated by Industrial Insurance or Charter disability provisions shall not be considered absence. An employee who returns after layoff, or who is reduced in rank to a position in the same or another department, may be given credit for such prior service.

 4.3.5 Any increase in salary based on service shall become effective upon the first day immediately following completion of the applicable period of service.

 4.3.6 Changes in Incumbent Status Transfers - An employee transferred to another position in the same class or having an identical salary range shall continue to be compensated at the same rate of pay until the combined service requirement is fulfilled for a step increase and shall thereafter receive step increases as provided in Section 4.3.1.

 4.3.7 Promotion - An employee appointed to a position in a class having a higher maximum salary shall be paid at the nearest step in the higher range which (1) provides the employee who is not at the top step of his/her current salary range a dollar amount at least equal to the next step increase of the employee's current salary range or (2) provides the employee who is at the top step of his/her current salary range an increase in pay through placement at the salary step in the new salary range which is closest to a four percent (4%) increase, provided that such increase shall not exceed the maximum step established for the higher paying position; and provided further, that this provision shall apply only to appointments of employees from regular full-time positions and shall not apply to appointments from positions designated as "intermittent" or "as needed" nor to "temporary assignments" providing pay "over regular salary while so assigned."

 4.3.7.1 Hours worked out of class shall apply toward salary step placement if the employee is promoted, or his/her position reclassified, to the same title as the out-of-class assignment within twelve (12) months of the end of such assignment.

 4.3.8 Demotion - An employee demoted because of inability to meet established performance standards from a regular full-time or part-time position to a position in a class having a lower salary range shall be paid the salary step in the lower range determined as follows:

 - If the rate of pay received in the higher class is above the maximum salary for the lower class, the employee shall receive the maximum salary of the lower range.

 - If the rate of pay received in the higher class is within the salary range for the lower class, the employee shall receive that salary rate for the lower class which, without increase, is nearest to the salary rate to which such employee was entitled in the higher class; provided however, the employee shall receive not less than the minimum salary of the lower range.

 4.3.9 Reorganization - An employee reduced because of organizational change or reduction in force from a regular full-time or part-time position to a position in a class having a lower salary range shall be paid the salary rate of the lower range which is nearest to the salary rate to which he/she was entitled in his/her former position without reduction; provided however, such salary shall in no event exceed the maximum salary of the lower range. If an employee who has completed twenty-five (25) years of Employer service and who within five (5) years of a reduction in lieu of layoff to a position in a class having a lower salary range, such employee shall receive the salary he/she was receiving prior to such second reduction as an "incumbent" for so long as he/she remains in such position or until the regular salary for the lower class exceeds the "incumbent" rate of pay.

 4.3.10 Reclassification - When a position is reclassified by the Personnel Director to a new or different class having a different salary range the employee occupying the position immediately prior to and at the time of reclassification shall receive the salary rate which shall be determined in the same manner as for a promotion; provided however, if the employee's salary prior to reclassification is higher than the maximum salary of the range for such new or different class, he/she shall continue to receive such higher salary as an "incumbent" for so long as he/she remains in position or until the regular salary for the classification exceeds the "incumbent" rate of pay.

 4.4 Court-Specific Classifications - The Court will submit to the City's Classification and Compensation Department, for classification review, Position Description Questionnaires (PDQs) for the following bargaining unit positions within 12 months of contract signing: Court Clerk Supervisor, Court Cashier Supervisor, and Administrative Support Supervisor. The Court encourages the Union's collaboration on the completion of these PDQs, the details of which can be arranged in the Labor Management Committee. The Court is not responsible for City classification determinations, and this provision does not guarantee any changes to the existing classifications of the named positions.

 ARTICLE 5 - HOURS OF WORK AND OVERTIME

 5.1 Hours Of Work - Eight (8) hours within nine (9) consecutive hours shall constitute a workday. Work schedules shall normally consist of five (5) consecutive days followed by two (2) consecutive days off, except for relief shift assignments.

 5.1.1 By mutual agreement between the Employer and the employee, an employee may work a schedule other than that set forth within Section 5.1.

 5.1.2 Implementation of an alternative work schedule for a work unit shall be subject to consultation and agreement with the Union.

 5.1.3 Any past, present or future work schedule in which an employee, by action of the Employer, receives eight (8) hours pay for less than eight (8) hours work per day may be changed by the Employer, at any time, so as to require such an employee to work eighty (8) hours per day for eight (8) hours pay.

 5.1.4 When the Employer deems it necessary, work schedules may be established other than Monday through Friday.

 5.1.5 Employees shall be assigned a regular work schedule (days of work). An employee shall normally be advised of a change in his/her work schedule by the end of the last shift of a week's schedule. In the event an employee is not given the required notice of a revised schedule, he/she shall be paid at the overtime rate for the first shift of the new schedule. If the starting time of an employee's work shift is to be changed to an earlier start time, notice shall be given to the employee at least forty-eight (48) hours in advance, Absent such notice, the overtime rate shall be due for the hours worked prior to the previous start time for the first shift of the new schedule. This provision shall not apply to part-time employees who are required to work extra hours or shifts with little or no notice.

 5.2 Meal Period - Employees shall receive a meal period which shall commence no less than two (2) hours nor more than five (5) hours from the beginning of the employee's regular shift or when he/she is called in to work on his/her regular day off. The meal period shall be no less than one-half (1/2) hour nor more than one (1) hour in duration and shall be without compensation. Should an employee be required to work in excess of five (5) continuous hours from the commencement of his/her regular shift without being provided a meal period, the employee shall be compensated two (2) times the employee's straight-time hourly rate of pay for the time worked during his/her normal meal period and be afforded a meal period at the first available opportunity during working hours without compensation. If an employee is required to work through the scheduled meal period and there is inability to reschedule the meal period during the shift, all hours worked shall be compensated.

 5.3 Rest Breaks - Employees shall receive a fifteen (15) minute rest break during the first four (4) hour period of their workday, and a second fifteen (15) minute rest break during the second four (4) hour period of their workday. Employees shall be compensated at their prevailing wage rate for time spent while on rest breaks.

 5.3.1 When a courtroom employee does not receive a rest break because the Court does not recess, the employee shall receive additional compensation in the form of fifteen (15) minutes of compensatory time for each rest break not received. Such compensatory time shall not entitle the employee to schedule a rest break at the end of the work shift and leave work early but shall be added to the employee's compensatory time account. To be eligible for the compensatory time, the employee must have not received a rest break during that portion of the employee's work shift before or after the meal break.

 It is the expectation that the employee will request a rest break through the Court Clerk and if necessary, request a replacement employee through the Court Clerk Supervisor or designee. It is also an expectation that the employee will document the compensatory time in lieu of a rest break no later than the next scheduled work shift on a form prescribed by the Employer.

 5.4 Overtime - All time worked in excess of eight (8) hours in any one shift shall be paid for at the rate of one and one-half (1 1/2) times the straight-time hourly rate of pay. Voluntary overtime in a lower classification may be compensated at the rate of pay for the lower classification.

 5.4.1 All time worked before an employee's regularly scheduled starting time shall be paid for at the rate of one and one-half (1 1/2) times the straight-time hourly rate of pay, provided the resulting hours worked for the day exceed the normally scheduled eight (8) hours.

 5.4.2 All time worked on an employee's regularly scheduled days off shall be paid for at the rate of one and one-half (1 1/2) times the straight- time hourly rate of pay.

 5.4.3 A "work week" for purposes of determining whether an employee exceeds forty (40) hours in a work week shall be a seven (7) consecutive day period of time beginning on Wednesday and ending on Tuesday except when expressly designated to begin and end on different days and times from the normal Wednesday through Tuesday work week.

 5.4.4 In administering an alternate work schedule, overtime shall be paid for any hours worked in excess of the employee's normal daily schedule.

 5.4.5 In no event shall an employee be paid overtime for hours worked less than eight (8) hours in a day unless the hours exceed forty (40) hours in a week.

 5.5 Compensatory Time - Compensatory time may be used as a method of compensating employees for overtime work in lieu of overtime pay as specified in Section 5.4. If used, the compensatory time shall be accrued at the rate of one and one-half (1 1/2) hours of compensatory time for each hour of overtime work. Accrual of compensatory time must be mutually agreeable to the employee and the Employer. The Employer may pay off a portion or all of accrued compensatory time over forty (40) hours, at its discretion, for all employees within the bargaining unit.

 5.6 Call Back - An employee who is called back to work after completing their regular shift shall be compensated at the overtime rate and shall receive no less than four (4) hours compensation at the straight-time hourly rate of pay.

 5.7 Meal Reimbursement - When an employee is specifically directed by the Employer to work two (2) hours or longer at the end of his/her normal work shift of at least eight (8) hours or work two (2) hours or longer at the end of his/her work shift of at least eight (8) hours when he/she is called in to work on his/her regular day off, or otherwise works under circumstances for which meal reimbursement is authorized per Ordinance 111768 and the employee actually purchases a reasonably priced meal away from his place of residence as a result of such additional hours of work, the employee shall be reimbursed for the "reasonable cost" of such meal in accordance with Ordinance 111768. In order to receive reimbursement, the employee must furnish the Employer with a receipt for said meal no later than forty-eight (48) hours from the beginning of his/her next regular shift; otherwise, the employee shall be paid a maximum of six dollars ($6.00) in lieu of reimbursement for the meal.

 5.7.1 To receive reimbursement for a meal under this provision the following rules shall be adhered to:

 (1) Said meal must be eaten within two (2) hours after completion of the overtime work. Meals shall not be saved, consumed and claimed at some later date.

 (2) In determining "reasonable cost" the following shall also be considered:

 - The time period during which the overtime is worked;

 - The availability of reasonably priced eating establishments at that time.

 (3) The Employer shall not reimburse for the cost of alcoholic beverages or gratuities.

 5.7.2 In lieu of any meal compensation as set forth within this Section, the Employer may, at its discretion, provide a meal.

 5.8 Standby Duty - Whenever an employee is placed on Standby Duty by the Employer, the employee shall be available at a predetermined location to respond to emergency calls and when necessary, return immediately to work. Employees who are placed on Standby Duty by the Employer shall be paid at rate of ten percent (10%) of the employee's straight-time hourly rate of pay. When an employee is required to return to work while on Standby Duty the Standby Duty pay shall be discontinued for the actual hours on work duty and compensation shall be provided in accordance with Section 5.6 Callback.

 5.9 Work Outside Of Classification - Whenever an employee is assigned by proper authority to perform the normal, ongoing duties of and accept responsibility of a higher-paid position when the duties of the higher position are clearly outside the scope of an employee's regular classification for a period of three (3) consecutive hours or longer, he/she shall be paid at the out-of-class salary rate while performing such duties and accepting such responsibility. The out-of-class salary rate shall be determined in the same manner as for a promotion. "Proper authority" shall be a supervisor, manager or director directly above the position which is being filled out of class, who has budget management authority of the work unit as determined by the Court Administrator. Employees must meet the minimum qualifications of the higher class, and must have demonstrated or be able to demonstrate their ability to perform the duties of the class.

 5.9.1 If an employee is assigned by proper authority or designee pursuant to Section 5.9 to perform the duties of a higher classification on a continuous basis in excess of sixty (60) consecutive calendar days, he/she shall thereafter, while still assigned to the higher level, be compensated for sick leave, vacation and holidays at the rate of the assigned, higher classification.

 5.9.2 An employee may be temporarily assigned to perform the duties of a lower classification without a reduction in pay. At management's discretion, an employee may be temporarily assigned the duties of a lower- level class, or the duties of a class with the same pay rate range as his/her primary class, across union jurisdictional lines, with no change to his/her regular pay rate. Out-of-class provisions related to threshold for payment, salary step placement, service credit for salary step placement and payment for absences do not apply in these instances.

 5.9.3 An out-of-class assignment shall be formally made in advance of the out-of-class opportunity created in normal operating conditions. Where the work is not authorized in advance, it is the responsibility of the proper authority to determine immediately how to accomplish the duties which would otherwise constitute an out-of-class assignment. Any employee may request that this determination be made. The employee will not carry out any duty of the higher-level position when such duty is not also a duty of his/ her own classification if the employee is not formally assigned to perform the duties on an out-of-class basis.

 No employee may assume the duties of the higher-paid position without being formally assigned to do so except in a bona fide emergency. When an employee has assumed an out-of-class role in a bona fide emergency, the individual may apply to his/her department head for retroactive payment of out-of-class pay. The decision of the department head as to whether the duties were performed and whether performance thereof was appropriate shall be final.

 5.9.4 An employee who is temporarily unable to perform the regular duties of his/her classification due to an off-the-job injury or illness may opt to perform work within a lower paying classification dependent upon the availability of such work and subject to the approval of the Employer. The involved employee shall receive the salary rate for the lower class which, without increase, is nearest to the salary rate to which such employee was entitled in the higher class.

 5.9.5 Employees working outside of classification for training purposes as designated by the Employer shall not be eligible for additional compensation as provided in Section 5.9.

 5.9.6 The Employer shall make a reasonable effort to accommodate employees who have an off-the-job injury or illness with light duty work if such work is available.

 5.10 Shift Premium - An employee who is scheduled to work not less than four (4) hours of his/her regular work shift during the evening (swing) shift shall receive 65 cents for all scheduled hours worked during such shift(s). An employee who is scheduled to work not less than four (4) hours of his/her regular work shift during the night (graveyard) shift, shall receive ninety cents (90 cents) shift premiums for all scheduled hours worked during such shift(s).

 5.10.1 The above shift premium shall apply to time worked as opposed to time off with pay and therefore, for example, the premium shall not apply to sick leave, vacation, holiday pay, funeral leave, etc. Employees who work one of the shifts for which a premium is paid and who are required to work overtime, shall have the shift premium included as part of the base hourly rate for purposes of computing the overtime rate pursuant to the requirements of the Fair Labor Standards Act.

 5.10.2 The swing shift period shall encompass the hours from 4:00 p.m. to midnight. The graveyard shift period shall encompass the hours from midnight to 8:00 a.m.

The amount of paid holiday time off for which the part-time employee is eligible shall be in proportion to the holiday time off provided for full-time employees. For example, a full-time employee working eighty (80) hours per pay period would be eligible for eight (8) hours off with pay on a holiday while a part-time employee who works forty (40) hours during the pay period preceding the holiday would be eligible for four (4) hours off with pay.

 6.5 All full-time employees shall receive eight (8) hours of pay per holiday. Those employees whose work schedules consist of work days in excess of eight (8) hours may use accrued vacation leave or compensatory time to supplement the holiday pay in order to receive pay for a full work day for a holiday. As an alternative, with supervisory and/or management approval, the employee may revert to a five (5) day, forty (40) hour schedule for the work week in which the holiday occurs, provided the reversion does not result in more than forty (40) hours of work in a work week requiring the payment of overtime.

</td></tr></table> 7.4 An employee who is eligible for vacation benefits shall accrue vacation from the date of entering City service or the date upon which he/she became eligible and may accumulate a vacation balance which shall never exceed at any time two (2) times the number of annual vacation hours for which the employee is currently eligible. Accrual and accumulation of vacation time shall cease at the time an employee's vacation balance reaches the maximum balance allowed and shall not resume until the employee's vacation balance is below the maximum allowed.

 7.5 Employees may, with Department approval, use accumulated vacation with pay after completing one thousand forty (1040) hours on regular pay status.

 7.6 In the event that the Employer cancels an employee's already scheduled and approved vacation, leaving no time to reschedule such vacation before the employee's maximum balance will be reached, the employee's vacation balance will be permitted to exceed the allowable maximum and the employee will continue to accrue vacation for a period of up to three months if such exception is approved by both the department head and the Personnel Director in order to allow rescheduling of the employee's vacation. In such cases the department head shall provide the Personnel Director with the circumstances and reasons leading to the need for such an extension. No extension of this grace period will be allowed.

 7.7 The minimum vacation allowance to be taken by an employee shall be one-half (1/2) of a day or, at the discretion of the head of the department, such lesser fraction of a day as shall be approved by the department head.

 7.8 An employee who leaves the City service for any reason after more than six (6) months' service shall be paid in a lump sum for any unused vacation he/she has previously accrued.

 7.9 Upon the death of an employee in active service, pay shall be allowed for any vacation earned and not taken prior to the death of such employee.

 7.10 An employee granted an extended leave of absence which includes the next succeeding calendar year shall be paid in a lump sum for any unused vacation he/she has previously accrued or, at the Employer's option, the employee shall be required to exhaust such vacation time before being separated from the payroll.

 Where the terms of this Section 7.10 are in conflict with the City of Seattle family and medical leave ordinance cited at SMC 4.26, as it exists or may be hereafter modified, the ordinance shall apply.

 7.11 Where an employee has exhausted his/her sick leave balance, the employee may use vacation or personal holiday for further leave for medical reasons. Verification of such usage by the employee's medical care provider is not automatically required for up to two occasions in a calendar year or up to 32 hours of vacation and/or personal holiday in lieu of sick leave in a calendar year. Use of vacation and personal holiday in lieu of sick leave beyond two instances or 32 hours in a calendar year is subject to verification by the employee's medical care provider. In all other instances, employees must use all accrued vacation prior to beginning a leave of absence, except that employees who are called to active military service or who respond to requests for assistance from Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) may, at their option, use accrued vacation in conjunction with leave of absence. Where the terms of this Section 7.11 are in conflict with the City of Seattle family and medical leave ordinance cited at SMC 4.26, as it exists or may be hereafter modified, the ordinance shall apply. Nothing in this provision shall in any way limit the application of Sections 8.1 and 8.1.1.1 of this Agreement.

 7.12 The department head shall arrange vacation time for employees on such schedules as will least interfere with the functions of the department but which accommodate the desires of the employee to the greatest degree feasible.

 ARTICLE 8 - SICK LEAVE, FUNERAL LEAVE, EMERGENCY

 LEAVE AND VEBA

 8.1 Sick Leave - Regular employees shall accumulate sick leave credit at the rate of .046 hours for each hour on regular pay status as shown on the payroll, but not to exceed forty (40) hours per week. New employees entering City service shall not be entitled to sick leave with pay during the first thirty (30) days of employment but shall accumulate sick leave credits during such thirty (30) day period. Sick leave credit may be used by the employee for bona fide cases of:

 A. Illness or injury which prevents the employee from performing his/her regular duties.

 B. Disability of the employee due to pregnancy and/or childbirth.

 C. Medical or dental appointments for the employee.

 D. Care of an employee's spouse or domestic partner, or the parent, sibling, dependent or adult child or grandparent of such employee or his or her spouse or domestic partner, in instances of an illness, injury, or health care appointment where the absence of the employee from work is required, or when such absence is recommended by a health care provider, and as required of the City by the Family Care Act, Chapter 296-130 W.A.C., and/or as defined and provided for by City Ordinance as cited at SMC 4.24.

 E. Non-medical care of their newborn children and the non-medical care of children placed with them for adoption consistent with Personnel Rule 7.7.3.

 F. Treatment of alcoholism or drug addiction as recommended by a physician, psychiatrist, certified social worker, or other qualified professional.

 8.1.1 Abuse of sick leave shall be grounds for suspension or dismissal.

 8.1.1.1 Regular work attendance is a requirement of continued employment. Employees using sick leave improperly or excessively may be subject to progressive discipline. Employees showing a pattern of absenteeism that indicates abuse of sick leave may be asked to justify their absences with a note from the treating health care professional. Failure to provide acceptable documentation may result in discipline.

 8.1.2 Unlimited sick leave credit may be accumulated.

 8.1.3 For calendar years 2008, 2009 and 2010, upon retirement, thirty- five percent (35%) of an employee's unused sick leave credit accumulation shall be transferred to a VEBA account (as described below) to be used according to Internal Revenue Service (IRS) regulations on the day prior to his retirement.

 Cash payments of unused sick leave may be deferred for a period of one (1) year or less, providing the employee notifies the Department Personnel Office of his/her desires at the time of retirement. Requests for deferred cash payments of unused sick leave shall be made in writing.

 8.1.3.1 Employees who are eligible to retire during the term of this contract shall participate in a vote administered by the union to determine if the Voluntary Employee Benefits Association (VEBA) benefit shall be offered to employees who elect to retire during the term of this contract. The VEBA benefit allows employees who are eligible to retire from City Service to cash out their unused sick leave balance upon retirement and place it in a VEBA account to be used for post-retirement healthcare costs as allowed under IRS regulations.

 Eligibility-to-Retire Requirements:

 * 5 - 9 years of service and are age 62 or older

 * 10 - 19 years of service and are age 57 or older

 * 20 - 29 years of service and are age 52 or older

 * 30 years of service and are any age

 For purposes of identifying all potential eligible-to-retire employees, the City shall create a list of members who are in the City's HRIS system at age 45 or older as of the final day of the contract term and provide this list to the union so that the union can administer the vote.

 1. If the eligible-to-retire members of the bargaining unit votes to accept the VEBA, then all members of the bargaining unit who retire during the term of this contract, shall either:

 a. place their sick leave cashout at 35% into their VEBA account, or

 b. forfeit the sick leave cash out altogether. There is no minimum threshold for the sick leave cash out.

 Members are not eligible to deposit their sick leave cashout into their deferred compensation account or receive cash.

 2. If the eligible-to-retire members of the bargaining unit votes to reject the VEBA, all members of the bargaining unit who retire during the term of this contract shall be ineligible to place their sick leave cashout into a VEBA account. Instead, these members shall have two choices:

 a. Members can cash out their sick leave balance at 35% and deposit those dollars into their deferred compensation account. The annual limits for the deferred compensation contributions as set by the IRS would apply; or

 b. Members can cash out their sick leave balance at 25% and receive the dollars as cash on their final paycheck.

 Sabbatical Leave and VEBA: Members of a bargaining unit that votes to accept the VEBA and who meet the eligible-to-retire criteria are not eligible to cash out their sick leave at 25% as a part of their sabbatical benefit. Members who do not meet the eligible-to-retire criteria may cash out their sick leave at 25% in accordance with the sabbatical benefit.

 8.1.4 Upon the death of an employee, either by accident or natural causes, twenty-five percent (25%) of such employee's accumulated sick leave credits shall be paid to his/her designated beneficiary.

 8.1.5 Change in position or transfer to another City department shall not result in loss of accumulated sick leave. An employee reinstated or re- employed within one (1) year in the same or another department after termination of service, except after dismissal for cause, resignation or quitting, shall be credited with all unused sick leave accumulated prior to such termination.

 8.1.6 Compensation for the first four (4) days of absence shall be paid upon approval of the Personnel Director or his designee. In order to receive compensation for such absence, employees shall make themselves available for such reasonable investigation, medical or otherwise, as the Personnel Director or his designee shall see fit to have made. Compensation for such absences beyond four (4) continuous days shall be paid only after approval of the Personnel Director or his designee of a request from the employee supported by a report of the employee's physician. The employee shall provide himself/herself with such medical treatment or take such other reasonable precautions as necessary to hasten recovery and provide for an early return to duty.

 8.1.7 Conditions Not Covered - Employees shall not be eligible for sick leave when:

 - Suspended or on leave without pay and when laid off or on other non-pay status.

 - Off work on a holiday.

 - An employee works during his/her free time for an employer other than the City of Seattle and his/her illness or disability arises therefrom.

 8.1.8 Prerequisites For Payment - The following applicable requirements shall be fulfilled in order to establish an employee's eligibility for sick leave benefits.

 8.1.8.1 Prompt Notification - The employee shall promptly notify the immediate supervisor, by telephone or otherwise, on the first day off due to illness and each day thereafter unless advised otherwise by the immediate supervisor. For those absences of more than one day, notification on his/her first day off with an expected date of return shall suffice. The employee shall advise the supervisor of any change in expected date of return. If an employee is on a special work schedule, particularly where a relief replacement is necessary when the employee is absent, the employee shall notify the immediate supervisor as far as possible in advance of the scheduled time to report for work.

 8.1.8.2 Notification While On Paid Vacation Or Compensatory Time Off - If an employee is injured or is taken ill while on paid vacation or compensatory time off, he/she shall notify his/her department on the first day of disability. However, if it is physically impossible to give the required notice on the first day, notice shall be provided as soon as possible and shall be accompanied by an acceptable showing of reasons for the delay. A doctor's statement or other acceptable proof of illness or disability, while on vacation or compensatory time off, must be presented regardless of the number of days involved.

 8.1.8.3 Filing Application - Unless there are extenuating circumstances, the employee shall submit the required application for sick leave pay within sixteen (16) working hours after his/her return to duty. However, if he/she is absent because of illness or injury for more than eighty (80) working hours, he/she shall then file an application for an indefinite period of time. The necessary forms shall be available to the employee through his/her Department Supervisor.

 8.1.8.4 Claims To Be In 15 minute increments - Sick leave shall be claimed in 15 minute increments to the nearest full 15 minute increment. A fraction of less than 8 minutes shall be disregarded. Separate portions of absence interrupted by a return to work shall be claimed on separate application forms.

 8.1.8.5 Limitations Of Claims - All sick leave claims shall be limited to the actual amount of time lost due to illness or disability. The total amount of sick leave claimed in any pay period by an employee shall not exceed the employee's sick leave accumulation as shown on the payroll for the pay period immediately preceding his/her illness or disability. It is the responsibility of his/her department to verify that sick leave accounts have not been overdrawn; and if a claim exceeds the number of hours an employee has to his/her credit, the department shall correct his/her application.

 8.1.8.6 Sick Leave Transfer Program - Employees shall be afforded the option to transfer and/or receive sick leave in accordance with the terms and conditions of the City's Sick Leave Transfer Program as established and set forth by City Ordinance. All benefits and/or rights existing under such program may be amended and/or terminated at any time as may be determined appropriate by the City. All terms, conditions and/or benefits of such program shall not be subject to the grievance procedure.

 8.2 Bereavement/Funeral Leave - Regular employees shall be allowed one (1) day off without salary deduction for bereavement purposes in the event of the death of any close relative; provided however, where attendance at a funeral or for bereavement purposes requires total travel of two hundred (200) miles or more, one (1) additional day with pay shall be allowed; provided further, the Department Head may, when circumstances require and upon application stating the reasons therefore, authorize for such purpose not to exceed an additional four (4) days chargeable to the sick leave account of the employee, but no combination of paid absence under this Section shall exceed five (5) days for any one (1) period of absence. In like circumstances and upon like application the Department Head may authorize for the purpose of attending the funeral/bereavement of a relative other than a close relative, a number of days off work not to exceed five (5) days chargeable to the sick leave account of an employee. For purposes of this Section, the term "close relative" shall mean the spouse or domestic partner, child, mother, stepmother, father, stepfather, brother, sister, grandchild, grandfather or grandmother of the employee or spouse or domestic partner, and the term "relative other than a close relative" shall mean the uncle, aunt, cousin, niece, nephew or the spouse or domestic partner of the brother, sister, child or grandchild of the employee or spouse or domestic partner.

 8.2.1 Bereavement/funeral leave may be allowed for bereavement purposes and/or attendance at the funeral of any other relative as allowed by Seattle Municipal Code (SMC) 4.28.020. Such relatives shall be determined as close relatives or relatives other than close relatives pursuant to the terms of SMC 4.28.020 for purposes of determining the extent of bereavement/funeral leave or sick leave allowable as provided for in Section 8.2. In the event SMC 4.28.020 is repealed in whole or in part by an initiative, the parties shall renegotiate this provision in accordance with the terms of Article 21.

 8.3 Emergency Leave - One (1) day or a portion thereof per calendar year without loss of pay may be taken off subject to approval of the employee's Supervisor and/or Department Head when it is necessary that the employee be immediately off work to attend to one of the following situations either of which necessitates immediate action on the part of the employee:

 The employee's spouse, domestic partner, child, grandparent or parent has unexpectedly become seriously ill or has had a serious accident; or

 An unforeseen occurrence with respect to the employee's household (e.g. fire, flood, or ongoing loss of power). "Household" shall be defined as the physical aspects of the employee's residence.

 The "day" of emergency leave may be used for two separate incidents. The total hours compensated under this provision, however, shall not exceed eight (8) in a contract year.

 8.4 Leaves of Absence - Requests for leaves of absence must be made by employees in writing to their manager. Such request shall be reviewed and considered under the provisions of Chapter 4.26 of the Seattle Municipal Code (Family and Medical Leave) and Chapter 7 of the Personnel Rules. The Union shall be provided a copy of correspondence or forms on which leave of absence requests are approved in writing when the leave extends for more than thirty (30) calendar days without pay.

 8.5 Jury Leave - Employees called to jury duty shall be paid their regular base pay while on jury duty and for other court related reasons as allowed by City Ordinance.

 8.6 Sabbatical Leave - Regular employees covered by this Agreement shall be eligible for sabbatical leave under the terms of Seattle Municipal Code Chapter 4.33.

 8.7 Reinstatement - An employee who goes on leave does not have a greater right to reinstatement or other benefits and conditions of employment than if the employee had been continuously employed during the leave period.

 ARTICLE 9 - INDUSTRIAL INJURY OR ILLNESS

 9.1 Any employee who is disabled in the discharge of his duties and if such disablement results in absence from his/her regular duties, shall be compensated, except as otherwise hereinafter provided, in the amount of eighty percent (80%) of the employee's normal hourly rate of pay, not to exceed two hundred and sixty-one (261) regularly scheduled workdays counted from the first regularly scheduled workday after the day of the on-the-job injury; provided the disability sustained must qualify the employee for benefits under State Industrial Insurance and Medical Aid Acts.

 9.1.1 Whenever an employee is injured on the job and compelled to seek immediate medical treatment, the employee shall be compensated in full for the remaining part of the day of injury without effect to his/her sick leave or vacation account. Scheduled workdays falling within only the first three (3) calendar days following the day of injury shall be compensable through accrued sick leave. Any earned vacation may be used in a like manner after sick leave is exhausted, provided that, if neither accrued sick leave nor accrued vacation is available, the employee shall be placed on nonpay status for these three (3) days. If the period of disability extends beyond fourteen (14) calendar days, then (1) any accrued sick leave or vacation leave utilized that results in absence from his/her regular duties (up to a maximum of eighty percent [80%] of the employee's normal hourly rate of pay per day) shall be reinstated by Industrial Insurance or (2) if no sick leave or vacation leave was available to the employee at that time, then the employee shall thereafter be compensated for the three (3) calendar days at the eighty percent (80%) compensation rate described in Section 9.1. Such compensation shall be authorized by the Personnel Director or his/her designee with the advice of such employee's department head on request from the employee supported by satisfactory evidence of medical treatment of the illness or injury giving rise to such employee's claim for compensation under SMC 4.44, as now or hereinafter amended.

 9.1.2 In no circumstances will the amount paid under these provisions exceed the normal take-home pay of an employee. This provision shall become effective when SMC 4.44, Disability Compensation, is revised to incorporate this limit.

 9.1.3 Employees must meet the standards listed in SMC 4.44.020 to be eligible for the benefit amount provided herein which exceeds the rate required to be paid by state law, hereinafter referred to as supplemental benefits. These standards require that employees: (1) comply with all Department of Labor and Industries rules and regulations and related City of Seattle and employing department policies and procedures; (2) respond, be available for and attend medical appointments and treatments and meetings related to rehabilitation, and work hardening, conditioning or other treatment arranged by the City and authorized by the attending physician; (3) accept modified or alternative duty assigned by supervisors when released to perform such duty by the attending physician; (4) attend all meetings scheduled by the City of Seattle Workers' Compensation or employing department concerning the employee's status or claim when properly notified at least five (5) working days in advance of such meeting unless other medical treatment conflicts with the meeting and the employee provides twenty-four (24) hours' notice of such meeting or examination. The City will provide a copy of the eligibility requirements to employees when they file a workers' compensation claim. If records indicate two (2) no-shows, supplemental benefits may be terminated no sooner than seven (7) days after notification to the employee. The City's action is subject to the grievance procedure.

 9.2 Compensation for holidays and earned vacation falling within a period of absence due to such disability shall be at the normal rate of pay but such days shall not be considered as regularly scheduled workdays as applied to the time limitations set forth within Section 9.1. Disabled employees affected by the provisions of SMC 4.44 shall continue to accrue vacation and sick leave as though actively employed during the period set forth within Section 9.1.

 9.3 Any employee eligible for the benefits provided by this Ordinance whose disability prevents him/her from performing his/her regular duties but, in the judgment of his/her physician could perform duties of a less strenuous nature, shall be employed at his/her normal rate of pay in such other suitable duties as the department head shall direct, with the approval of such employee's physician until the Personnel Director requests closure of such employee's claim pursuant to SMC 4.44, as now or hereinafter amended.

 9.4 Sick leave shall not be used for any disability herein described except as allowed in Section 9.1.1.

 9.5 The afore-referenced disability compensation shall be understood to be in lieu of State Industrial Insurance Compensation And Medical Aid.

 9.6 Appeals of any denials under this Article shall be made through the Department of Labor and Industries as prescribed in Title 51 RCW.

 9.7 The parties agree either may reopen for negotiation the terms and conditions of this Article.

 10.5.1 If a probationary employee is subsequently appointed to a different classification in the same or different department, the employee shall serve a complete twelve (12) month probationary period in the new classification. If a regular employee is subsequently appointed to a different classification in the same or different department, the employee shall serve a complete twelve (12) month trial service period in the new classification.

 10.5.2 Within the same department, if a regular employee is appointed to a higher classification while serving in a trial service period, the trial service period for the lower classification and the new trial service period for the higher classification shall overlap provided that the higher and lower classifications are in the same or a closely related field. The employee shall complete the terms of the original trial service period and be given regular status in the lower classification. Such employee shall also be granted the rights normally accruing to trial service for the remainder of the trial service period in the higher classification.

 10.5.3 Within the same department, if a probationary employee is regularly appointed to a higher classification while serving in a probationary period, the probationary period and the new trial service period for the higher classification shall overlap provided the higher and the lower classifications are in the same or a closely related field.

 ARTICLE 11 - TRANSFERS, VOLUNTARY REDUCTION, LAYOFF AND RECALL

 11.1 Transfers - The transfer of an employee shall not constitute a promotion except as provided in Section 11.1.2(5).

 11.1.1 Intra-departmental Transfers - A Department Head may transfer an employee from one position to another position in the same class in his/her department without prior approval of the Personnel Director, but must report any such transfer to the Personnel Department within five (5) days of its effective date.

 11.1.2 Other transfers may be made upon consent of the Department Head of the departments involved and with the Personnel Director's approval as follows:

 (1) Transfer in the same class from one department to another.

 (2) Transfer to another class in the same or a different department in case of injury in line of duty either with the City service or with the armed forces in time of war, resulting in permanent partial disability, where showing is made that the transferee is capable of satisfactorily performing the duties of the new position.

 (3) Transfer, in lieu of layoff, may be made to a position in the same class to a different department, upon showing that the transferee is capable of satisfactorily performing the duties of the position, and that a regular employee or probationer is not displaced. The employee subject to layoff shall have this opportunity for transfer provided there is no one on the reinstatement recall list for the same class for that department. If there is more than one employee eligible for transfer in lieu of layoff in the same job title, the employee names shall be placed on a layoff transfer list in order of job class seniority. Eligibility to choose this opportunity to transfer is limited to those employees who have no rights to other positions in the application of the layoff language herein, including Section 11.3.4.

 The department will be provided with the names of eligible employees and their job skills. The department will fill the position with the most senior employee with the job skills needed for the position. The department may test or otherwise affirm the employee has the skills and ability to perform the work.

 An employee on the layoff transfer list who is not placed in another position prior to layoff shall be eligible for placement on the reinstatement recall list pursuant to Section 11.4.

 (4) Transfer, in lieu of layoff, may be made to a position in another class in the same or a different department, upon showing that the transferee is capable of satisfactorily performing the duties of the position, and that a regular employee or probationer is not displaced.

 (5) Transfer, in lieu of layoff, may be made to a position in another class when such transfer would constitute a promotion or advancement in the service, provided a showing is made that the transferee is capable of satisfactorily performing the duties of the position and that a regular employee or probationer is not displaced, and when transfer in lieu of layoff under Section 11.1.2 of this Article is not practicable.

 (6) The Personnel Director may approve a transfer under Sections 11.1.2 (1), (2), (3), (4), or (5) above with the consent of the appointing authority of the receiving department only, upon a showing of circumstances justifying such action.

 (7) Transfer may be made to another similar class with the same maximum rate of pay in the same or a different department upon the director's approval of a written request by the appointing authority.

 11.1.2.1 Employees transferred pursuant to the provisions of Section 11.1.2 shall serve probationary and/or trial service periods as may be required in Article 10, Sections 10.5, 10.5.1, 10.5.2, and 10.5.3.

 11.1.3 Regular part-time employees shall have the first right of refusal for vacant, regular full-time positions in their work unit, provided the positions are to be filled and the employees submit written requests to be considered for the position(s). This option may be exercised only if the vacant, regular full-time positions are within the same job classification and working job title; that is, the job duties of the part-time and full- time positions are the same. A Department Director may refuse to approve a transfer request of an employee who is under written notice that his or her work performance is not satisfactory. Should two or more part-time employees request the transfer, the Department Director shall conduct a competitive process in accordance with existing policies and procedures.

 11.2 Voluntary Reduction - A regularly appointed employee may be reduced to a lower class upon his/her written request stating his/her reason for such requested reduction, if the request is concurred in by the Department Head and is approved by the Personnel Director. Such reduction shall not displace any regular employee or any probationary employee.

 11.2.1 An employee so reduced shall be entitled to credit for previous regular service in the lower class and to other service credit in accordance with Section 11.3.5. Upon a showing, concurred in by the Department Head that the reason for such voluntary reduction no longer exists, the Personnel Director may restore the employee to his/her former status.

 11.3 Layoff - Layoff shall be defined as the interruption of employment and suspension of pay of any regular or probationary employee because of lack of work, lack of funds or through reorganization. Reorganization when used as a criterion for layoff shall be based upon a specific policy decision by legislative authority to eliminate, restrict or reduce functions or funds of a particular department.

 11.3.1 Employees within a given class in a department shall be subject to layoff in accordance with the following order:

 (1) Temporary or intermittent employees not earning service credit;

 (2) Probationary employees (except as their layoff may be affected by military service during probation);

 (3) Regular employees in order of their length of service, the one with the least amount of service being laid off first.

 11.3.2 The Employer may layoff out of the order set forth within Section 11.3.1 for the following reason:

 (1) Upon showing by the Court Administrator that the operating needs of the department require a special experience, training, or skill.

 ARTICLE 18 - SUBORDINATION OF AGREEMENT

If at any Step in the contract grievance procedure, management's answer in writing is unsatisfactory, the Union's reason for non-acceptance must be presented in writing.

 20.4 Failure by an employee or the Union to comply with any time limitation of the procedure in this Article shall constitute withdrawal of the grievance; provided however, any time limits stipulated in the grievance procedure may be extended for stated periods of time by the appropriate parties by mutual agreement in writing.

 20.5 Arbitration awards or grievance settlements shall not be made retroactive beyond the date of the occurrence or non-occurrence upon which the grievance is based, that date being twenty (20) business days or less prior to the initial filing of the grievance.

 20.6 A contract grievance shall be processed in accordance with the following procedure:

 20.6.1 Step 1 - A contract grievance shall be verbally presented by the Union representative to the Manager of the aggrieved employee within twenty (20) business days of the alleged contract violation. The parties shall make every effort to settle the contract grievance at this stage promptly. The Manager shall verbally answer the grievance within ten (10) business days after discussion of the alleged contract grievance with the Union representative. If the grievance was presented by the employee, the Manager shall also provide the Union with notification of the response to the grievance.

 20.6.2 Step 2 - If the contract grievance is not resolved as provided in Step 1, or if the contract grievance is initially submitted at this Step pursuant to Section 20.2, it shall be reduced to written form, which shall include identification of the Section(s) of the Agreement allegedly violated and the violation. The Union shall forward the written contract grievance to the Division Director with copies to the Court Administrator and Court Human Resources Manager within ten (10) business days after the Step 1 answer.

 With Mediation

 At the time the aggrieved employee and/or the Union Representative submits the grievance to the Division Director, the Union or the aggrieved employee or the Division Director may submit a written request for voluntary mediation assistance, with a copy to the Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) Coordinator, the City Director of Labor Relations and the Union Representative. If the ADR Coordinator determines that the case is in line with the protocols and procedures of the ADR process, within fifteen (15) business days from receipt of the request for voluntary mediation assistance, the ADR Coordinator or his/her designee will schedule a mediation conference and make the necessary arrangements for the selection of a mediator(s). The mediator(s) will serve as an impartial third party who will encourage and facilitate a resolution to the dispute. The mediation conference(s) will be confidential and will include the parties. The Union Representative and a Labor Negotiator from City Labor Relations may attend the mediation conference(s). Other persons may attend with the permission of the mediator(s) and both parties. If the parties agree to settle the matter, the mediator(s) will assist in drafting a settlement agreement, which the parties shall sign. An executed copy of the settlement agreement shall be provided to the parties, with either a copy or a signed statement of the disposition of the grievance submitted to the City Director of Labor Relations and the Union Representative. The relevant terms of the settlement agreement shall be provided by the parties to the department's designated officials who need to assist in implementing the agreement. If the grievance is not settled within ten (10) business days of the initial mediation conference date, the City Director of Labor Relations, the Division Director and the Union Representative shall be so informed by the ADR Coordinator.

 The parties to a mediation shall have no power through a settlement agreement to add to, subtract from, alter, change, or modify the terms of the collective bargaining agreement or to create a precedent regarding the interpretation of the collective bargaining agreement or to apply the settlement agreement to any circumstance beyond the explicit dispute applicable to said settlement agreement.

 If the grievance is not resolved through mediation, the Division Director and/or his/her designee shall thereafter convene a meeting within ten (10) business days after receipt of notification that the grievance was not resolved through mediation between the Union Representative and aggrieved employee, together with the Human Resources Manager, Section Manager and any other members of management whose presence is deemed necessary to a fair consideration of the alleged contract grievance. The Division Director and/or his/her designee shall give a written answer to the Union within ten (10) business days after the contract grievance meeting.

 Without Mediation

 The Division Director and/or his/her designee shall thereafter convene a meeting within ten (10) business days between the Union Representative and aggrieved employee, together with the Court Administrator, Section Manager and any other members of management whose presence is deemed necessary to a fair consideration of the alleged contract grievance. The Division Director and/or his/her designee shall give a written answer to the Union within ten (10) business days after the contract grievance meeting.

 20.6.3 Step 3 - If the contract grievance is not resolved as provided in Step 2, the written contract grievance defined in the same manner as provided in Step 2, shall be forwarded within ten (10) business days after the Step 2 answer to the City Director of Labor Relations and the Court Administrator, with copies to the Court Human Resources Manager and the Division Director. The City Director of Labor Relations and the Court Administrator will determine which entity, the Court or the City, has authority to resolve the grievance at Step 3. The Court and the City will resolve any conflict over which entity has authority to resolve a grievance in accordance with the Letter of Agreement between the Court and the City dated December 10, 2004, a copy of which has been provided to the Union. The timelines for Step 3 shall be extended for up to 30 days, if necessary to resolve any such conflict.

 Mediation can be requested at Step 3 in the same manner as outlined in Step 2. The grievance must be filed in the time frame specified in Step 3 and responded to in the time frame specified in Step 3 after receipt of notification from the ADR Coordinator that the grievance was not resolved through mediation.

 For grievances under City authority, the Director of Labor Relations or his/her designee shall investigate the alleged contract grievance and, if deemed appropriate, he/she shall convene a meeting between the appropriate parties within ten (10) business days. He/she shall thereafter make a confidential recommendation to the Presiding Judge who shall, in turn, give the Union an answer in writing ten (10) business days after receipt of the contract grievance or the meeting between the parties.

 For grievances under Court authority, the Court Administrator or his/her designee shall investigate the alleged contract grievance and, if deemed appropriate, he/she shall convene a meeting between the appropriate parties within ten (10) business days. The Court Administrator shall thereafter give the Union an answer in writing ten (10) business days after receipt of the contract grievance or the meeting between the parties.

 20.6.4 Step 4 - Grievances under City Authority. If the contract grievance is not settled in Step 3, the Union may submit any grievance under City authority to arbitration within twenty (20) business days after the Employer's answer in Step 3. All grievances under Court authority are covered under Section 20.6.5 below.

 Mediation can be requested at Step 4 in the same manner as outlined in Step 2. The grievance must be submitted to binding arbitration within the time frame specified in Step 4 and processed within the time frame specified in Step 4 after receipt of notification from the ADR Coordinator that the grievance was not resolved in mediation.

 The notice of arbitration shall be filed with the City Director of Labor Relations with copies to the Court Administrator, Presiding Judge and Court Human Resources Manager, and shall include the following information:

 - Identification of Section(s) of Agreement allegedly violated.

 - Nature of the alleged violation.

 - Question(s) which the arbitrator is being asked to decide.

 - Remedy sought.

 Within ten (10) business days thereafter, the City Director of Labor Relations or his/her designee shall schedule a meeting or confer with the Union to select an arbitrator. If the Employer and the Union are unable to agree upon an arbitrator within five (5) business days after they first meet to determine such an appointee, the Union shall request the Federal Mediation and Conciliation Service (FMCS) to provide a list of nine (9) arbitrators from which the parties may select one.

 20.6.5 Step 4 - Grievances under Court Authority. If the contract grievance is not settled in Step 3, the Union may submit the grievance to arbitration within twenty (20) business days after the Employer's answer in Step 3.

 Mediation can be requested at Step 4 in the same manner as outlined in Step 2. The grievance must be submitted to arbitration within the time frame specified in Step 4 and processed within the time frame specified in Step 4 after receipt of notification from the ADR Coordinator that the grievance was not resolved in mediation.

 The notice of arbitration shall be filed with the City Director of Labor Relations and the Court Administrator, with copies to the Presiding Judge and Court Human Resources Manager, and shall include the following information:

 - Identification of Section(s) of Agreement allegedly violated.

 - Nature of the alleged violation.

 - Question(s) which the arbitrator is being asked to decide.

 - Remedy sought.

 After the Notice of Arbitration is filed, the Court and the Union will utilize, on a rotating basis beginning with the first Arbitrator listed, an Arbitrator from the following panel of four Standing Arbitrators to hear the parties' dispute:

 * Timothy Williams

 * Michael Beck

 * Eric Lindauer

 * Alan Krebs

 However, if the Standing Arbitrator who would be next in the rotation is not available to hear the matter within 180 days of the request, the next individual on the list shall be contacted until one of the Standing Arbitrators can hear the matter within 180 days from the date of the request. If none of the Standing Arbitrators is available within 180 days, the Standing Arbitrator who would be next in the rotation will hear the dispute unless parties agree to use one of the other three.

 20.7 The parties shall abide by the award made in connection with any arbitrable difference. There shall be no suspension of work, slowdown, or curtailment of services while any difference is in process of adjustment or arbitration.

 20.8 In connection with any arbitration proceeding held pursuant to this Agreement, it is understood that:

 20.8.1 The arbitrator shall have no power to render a decision that will add to, subtract from or alter, change or modify the terms of this Agreement, and his power shall be limited to interpretation or application of the express terms of this Agreement, and all other matters shall be excluded from arbitration.

 20.8.2 The decision of the arbitrator regarding any arbitrable difference shall be final, conclusive and binding upon the Employer, the Union and the employees involved.

 20.8.3 The cost of the arbitrator shall be borne equally by the Employer and the Union. Each party shall bear the cost of presenting its own case.

 20.8.4 The arbitrator's decision shall be made in writing and shall be issued to the parties within thirty (30) calendar days after the case is submitted to the arbitrator.

 20.9 In no event shall this Agreement alter or interfere with disciplinary procedures followed by the City or provided for by City Charter, Ordinance or Law; provided however, disciplinary action may be processed through the contract grievance procedure; provided further, an employee covered by this Agreement must upon initiating objections relating to disciplinary action use either the contract grievance procedure contained herein (with the Union processing the grievance) or pertinent Civil Service procedures regarding disciplinary appeals. In the event both a contract grievance and a Civil Service Commission appeal have been filed regarding the same disciplinary action, only upon withdrawal of the Civil Service Commission appeal may the grievance be pursued under this contract grievance procedure.

 20.10 A reclassification grievance will be initially submitted by the Union in writing to the Director of Labor Relations with a copy to the Court Administrator, and the Court Human Resources Manager. The Union will identify in the grievance letter the name(s) of the grievant(s), their current job classification, the proposed job classification, and any other relevant information that will explain why the position should be reclassified. After initial submittal of the grievance, the procedure will be as follows:

 (1) The grievant(s) will be required to submit a completed Position Description Questionnaire (PDQ) to the Director of Labor Relations within ninety (90) calendar days of the filing of the grievance. If the PDQ is not submitted with ninety (90) calendar days the grievance will be deemed withdrawn. Upon receipt of the PDQ, the Director of Labor Relations or designee will notify the Union of such receipt and will provide a date (not to exceed six (6) months from the date of receipt of the PDQ) when a proposed classification determination report responding to the grievance will be sent to the Union. The Director of Labor Relations will provide notice to the Union when, due to unforeseen delays, the time for the classification review will exceed the six (6) month period.

 (2) The Court Administrator, upon receipt of the proposed classification determination report from the Director of Labor Relations, will respond to the grievance in writing.

 (3) If the grievance is not resolved, the Union may within twenty (20) business days of the date the grievance response is received, submit to the Director of Labor Relations a letter designating one of the following processes for final resolution:

 A. The Union may submit the grievance to binding arbitration per Section 20.6.4, or

 B. The Union may request the classification determination be reviewed by the Classification Appeals Board. The Classification Appeals Board will then convene a hearing and the Board will make a recommendation to the Personnel Director within forty-five (45) calendar days of the appeal hearing. The Director of Labor Relations or designee will respond to the Union after receipt of the Personnel Director's determination. If the Personnel Director affirms the Classification Board recommendation, that decision shall be final and binding and not subject to further appeal. If the Personnel Director does not affirm the Classification Appeals Board decision and the grievance is thereby not resolved, the Union may submit the grievance to arbitration per Section 20.6.4.

 ARTICLE 21 - SAVINGS CLAUSE

 21.1 If an Article of this Agreement or any Addenda thereto should be held invalid by operation of law or by any tribunal of competent jurisdiction, or if compliance with or enforcement of any Article should be restrained by such tribunal, the remainder of this Agreement and Addenda shall not be affected hereby, and the parties shall enter into immediate collective bargaining negotiations for the purpose of arriving at a mutually satisfactory replacement for such Article.

 ARTICLE 22 - TERM OF AGREEMENT

 22.1 All terms and provisions of this Agreement shall become effective on June 11, 2008, or upon the signature date, whichever is later, unless otherwise specified elsewhere within this Agreement, and shall remain in full force and effect through December 31, 2010. Any modifications requested by either party must be submitted to the other party on the first date mutually agreed upon to begin negotiations of a successor agreement and any modifications requested at a later date shall not be subject to negotiations unless mutually agreed upon by both parties.

 22.1.1 Notwithstanding the provisions of Section 22.1, in the event negotiations for a new Agreement extend beyond the anniversary date of this Agreement, all of the terms and provisions of this Agreement shall continue to remain in full force and effect during the course of collective bargaining until such time as the terms of a new Agreement have been consummated or unless either party serves the other party with ten (10) days' written notice of intent to terminate the existing Agreement.

 The Mayor hereby agrees only to those provisions that are related to wages and wage-related benefits. The Presiding Judge hereby agrees only to those provisions that are not related to wages or wage-related benefits.

 MEMORANDUM OF UNDERSTANDING

 By and between

 CITY OF SEATTLE

 THE SEATTLE MUNICIPAL COURT

 And

 TEAMSTERS, LOCAL 763 - MUNICIPAL COURT EMPLOYEES

 AND SUPERVISORS UNITS

 This Memorandum of Understanding ("MOU") is entered into between the City of Seattle and the Seattle Municipal Court ("Court") and the individual unions that are signatory to this MOU that are also members of the Coalition of City Unions ("Coalition"). Collectively, the Court, the City, and the unions shall be known as "the Parties."

 The Parties agree to amend their collective bargaining agreements to incorporate the following terms and conditions:

 I. 2010 Furloughs

 1) Scope. All employees who are members of unions that are signatory to this Agreement shall participate in furloughs, except for certain employees whose job titles and positions the Parties have identified as exceptions. The Parties shall convene labor-management meetings prior to the first furlough in order to reach agreement on exceptions or alternatives to the furlough schedule.

 Scheduled furlough days may not be cancelled or rescheduled except in the event of an emergency with the approval of the Court Administrator. If this occurs the employee shall schedule a different furlough day in the same or subsequent pay period in which the furlough occurs on the day before or after their weekend. Work performed on the previously scheduled furlough day shall not be paid overtime except as required by applicable collective bargaining agreement or the FLSA.

 2) Total Furlough Hours. Full-time employees subject to furloughs shall each take a number of unpaid furlough days totaling eighty (80) hours (or a pro-rated equivalent for part-time employees) in 2010.

 3) Scheduling of Furlough Days. Scheduling of furlough days shall be determined by the Court on a department or work unit basis, and will be according to operational need. Employees will be assigned furlough dates in 2010, as scheduled by their departments, to equal a total of eighty (80) hours (pro-rated for part-time employees). Employees on alternative schedules shall schedule furlough days in order to equal a total of eighty (80) hours (e.g., employees on 4/10s shall take eight (8) furlough days of ten (10) hours each). Furlough days will generally be scheduled on "premium days," which are the work days preceding and following City holidays, and on other available Fridays throughout 2010.

 The Court agrees to discuss how furlough days will be scheduled in labor- management meetings by bargaining unit, including how employee requests for furlough dates may be considered. Employees will not be required to take more than one furlough day within two consecutive pay periods. Furlough dates will be set by the end of 2009.

 Premium days are identified as follows:

 January 4

 January 15 and 19

 February 12 and 16

 May 28 and June 1

 July 2 and 6

 September 3 and 7

 November 12

 November 24 and 29

 December 23 and 27

 December 30

 Other available Friday furlough dates include:

 January 8, 22, 29

 February 5, 19, 26

 March 5, 12, 19, 26

 April 2, 9, 16, 23, 30

 May 7, 14, 21

 June 4, 11, 18, 25

 July 9, 16, 23, 30

 August 6, 13, 20, 27

 September 10, 17, 24

 October 1, 8, 15, 22, 29

 November 5, 19

 December 3, 10, 17

 4) Leave Accrual. Furlough days will accrue sick leave and vacation time. However, furlough hours may not count towards the hours thresholds used to determine vacation accrual rates. The value of such accrued leave will either be accrued as earned or will be loaded into employees' leave balances by the end of 2010.

 5) Holidays. Furlough hours will not affect employee holiday pay or holiday benefits.

 6) Personal Holidays. Furlough hours will count towards the hours threshold used to determine the number of personal holidays received.

 7) Wage Exemption. Employees whose pay is less than eighteen dollars ($18.00) an hour may opt to use paid vacation, personal holidays, or compensatory time during their absence for a furlough day.

 8) Retirement. The City and employees will not make contributions into the retirement system for furlough days, nor will employees receive service credit for retirement for furlough days.

 An employee assigned to a work group subject to furloughs who plans to retire by December 31, 2012, shall be permitted to use vacation or compensatory time on furlough dates, provided he or she submits a written notice of intent to retire to his or her Human Resources unit no later than December 31, 2010. Should such employee not retire by December 31, 2012, the employee shall return payment for the leave used on furlough days to the City either by pay or deduction of equivalent vacation or compensatory hours.

 9) Health Insurance and Other Benefits. Medical, dental, vision and any other insured benefits coverage shall not be impacted by the furloughs.

 10) Personnel Processes. Furloughs will not count as a break in service and shall not impact seniority, step placement, probationary periods and trial service periods.

 11) Temporary Employees and Volunteers. Temporary employees and volunteers shall not be assigned to perform work to cover the time loss associated with furloughs.

 12) The Parties will use their labor-management committees as a forum for discussion and resolution of implementation issues associated with furloughs.

 II. Contracting Out and Span of Control. The Court agrees to participate in labor-management meetings convened by the City as appropriate with unions signatory to this Agreement to review the City's 2010 budgetary process relating to contracting out and span of control issues. One purpose of the City's review is intended to reduce or eliminate the practice of contracting out of work that can be performed by the City employees to further reduce the need for employee layoffs or reductions of work hours.

 III. Reinstatement and Project Hire. The length of time an employee may remain on the reinstatement list for a position from which he or she was laid off in 2009 or 2010 shall increase from one (1) year to two (2) years. The length of time that an employee may participate in Project Hire for an employee laid off in 2009 or 2010 shall increase from one (1) year to two (2) years.

 IV. Other Terms and Conditions.

 1) The Parties may reopen and negotiate the terms of this MOU by mutual agreement.

 2) To the extent that collective bargaining agreements, City or Court procedures, rules or guidelines conflict with this MOU, this MOU shall prevail.

 3) Any dispute regarding the interpretation and/or application of this MOU shall be addressed pursuant to the terms of the applicable Union's grievance procedure, provided that if more than one Union has the same or similar dispute, the grievances shall be consolidated.

 4) It is the intent of this agreement to mitigate layoffs of Coalition union members signatory to this agreement.

 CITY OF SEATTLE/SEATTLE MUNICIPAL COURT

 And

 PUBLIC, PROFESSIONAL & OFFICE-CLERICAL EMPLOYEES AND DRIVERS

 LOCAL UNION NO. 763

 (MUNICIPAL COURT EMPLOYEES AND SUPERVISORS' UNITS)

 (COALITION OF CITY UNIONS MEMBERS)

 (Amending existing collective bargaining agreements

 expiring December 31, 2010)

 WHEREAS, certain unions representing employees at the City of Seattle/Seattle Municipal Court have formed a coalition (herein referred to as the "Coalition of City Unions") to collectively negotiate wages, health care, retirement and other conditions of employment with the City of Seattle (herein referred to as "the City;" together the City and the Coalition of City Unions shall be referred to as "the Parties"); and

 WHEREAS, the Coalition of City Unions for the purpose of this Memorandum of Understanding shall include the Public, Professional & Office-Clerical Employees and Drivers Local Union No. 763 Municipal Court Employees and Supervisors Units; and

 WHEREAS, Ordinance 122551 authorized the October 3, 2007 Tentative Agreement between the Parties, and certain additional ordinances authorized collective bargaining agreements consistent with the Tentative Agreement between the Parties for the period of January 1, 2008 through December 31, 2010; and

 WHEREAS, Seattle Municipal Code 4.36, as amended by ordinance, provides for the administration and funding of the Seattle City Employees' Retirement System; and

 WHEREAS, the Parties have voluntarily entered into negotiations on wages, health care, retirement and other conditions of employment and have come to the following agreement:

 1) Existing collective bargaining agreements between the parties shall be amended so that the term of the agreement covers the time period of January 1, 2008 through December 31, 2011;

 2) All wages, hours, and working conditions shall continue as expressed in the labor agreements between the Parties, with the exception of the following items:

 A) Effective January 5, 2011, the wages of all job titles represented by the Coalition of City Unions signatory to this Memorandum of Understanding shall be increased by 100% of the annual average growth rate of the bi- monthly Seattle-Tacoma-Bremerton Area Consumer Price Index for Urban Wage Earners and Clerical Workers (CPI-W) for the period August 2008 through June 2009 to the period August 2009 through June 2010, provided however, said percentage increase shall not be less than two percent (2%) nor shall it exceed seven percent (7%).

 B) The parties agree that the Seattle Municipal Code regarding the funding of the Seattle City Employees' Retirement System (hereinafter, "System") shall be amended consistent with the following language:

 If a year-end actuarial study commissioned by the System finds that the amortization period for the System's unfunded actuarial liability exceeds thirty (30) years, based on the current contribution rate of 8.03% to the System that the City and employee(s) each pay, and the City determines that an increase in contribution rates to the System is necessary, the City and employees shall equally increase contribution rates. Such increases shall not result in employees paying greater than a 10.03% contribution rate.

 The required contribution rate increases, if necessary, shall take effect no sooner than the beginning of the first pay period of the year following completion of the actuarial study. For example, if the actuarial study for the System as of December 31, 2008 was presented to the Retirement Board in June 2009, and if that study showed an amortization period for the unfunded liability in excess of thirty (30) years that the City determined required a total increase in contributions of one percent (1%) to meet the System's unfunded liability threshold, the City's contribution rate would increase by one-half of one percent (.5%) resulting in an 8.53% City contribution rate and the employee contribution rate would increase by one-half of one percent (.5%) resulting in an 8.53% employee contribution rate as soon as the beginning of the first pay period of 2010.
