This commitment includes keeping abreast of the defendant's participation in and compliance with the MHC Conditions of Release or Sentence, appearing with the defendant at scheduled reviews or other hearings, and being assigned to the defendant for any new cases in the MHC filed with Seattle Municipal Court.

 b. The Agency and the attorneys assigned to MHC shall embrace the MHC goals, philosophy and principles, including working collaboratively with the MHC team, provided that such collaborative approach is not in conflict with counsel's duties under the Rules of Professional Conduct of zealous representation, confidentiality and undivided loyalty, and the constitutions of the United States and Washington State.

 c. The Agency shall assign specific attorneys who are experienced in working with mentally ill misdemeanants to the MHC for a period of two (2) years to assure consistency of experienced staff.

 f. The Agency and the attorneys assigned to MHC shall participate as required by SMC for future and on-going evaluation efforts and in MHC program development processes as scheduled.

The Seattle Community Court serves "chronic public system users" - offenders who repeatedly commit low-level crimes, fail to comply with sanctions, fail to appear for Court, and who use jail days when they could be more effectively rehabilitated through alternative strategies.

 a. The Agency and the attorneys assigned to Community Court shall embrace the Community Court goals, philosophy and principles, including working collaboratively with the Community Court team, provided that such collaborative approach is not in conflict with counsel's duties under the Rules of Professional Conduct of zealous representation, confidentiality and undivided loyalty, and the constitutions of the United States and Washington State.

 b. The Agency shall assign specific attorneys who are experienced in working with chronic homeless, alcoholic and mentally ill misdemeanants who voluntarily opt-in to the Community Court for a period of, usually, up to 90 days.

 d. The Agency and the attorneys assigned to Community Court shall assure (through established protocols) expeditious integration of referral and assessment and appropriate referrals to the Community Court at arraignment and without undue delay in the schedule for arraignment. This shall include Community Court referrals from the weekend calendar.

 e. The Agency and the attorneys assigned to Community Court shall participate as required by SMC for future and on-going evaluation efforts and in Community Court program development processes as scheduled.

 13. Provide for representation on any City criminal justice committees or workgroups as requested by the Contract Administrator, the Court, or any other City criminal justice agency. The Primary Defender shall represent the interests of the three defender agencies at these meetings. The Primary Defender shall keep the Secondary and Third Defenders informed of the issues presented at these meetings. Should a difference of opinion arise among the defender agencies as to the position the Defense should take on an issue, the Secondary and Third Defenders may give their opinion in writing to the Primary Defender. The Primary Defender will then share this opinion with the other members of the committee or workgroup.

 F. Duties and Responsibilities of Agency Attorneys: In order to perform their duties under this Contract, staff attorneys of the Agency shall:

 1. Counsel and represent in all ensuing criminal proceedings before appeal those clients who are officially referred by the Court. Such services include, but are not limited to: preparation for and representation of the client at the pretrial hearings, trial and at sentencing. Attorneys or other staff will make efforts to call or e- mail` out-of-custody clients to remind them of upcoming court dates.

 2. Use City funding to represent clients only in criminal matters in Seattle Municipal Court and related infractions, writs, and RALJ appeals. Attorneys shall not use City funding to represent clients in any matter which is civil in nature.

 The amount of payment to the Agency ("Payment") for the period for January 1, 2009 through June 31, 2011, will be determined based on the 2009, 2010, and 2011 budgets passed by the Seattle City Council.

In the event that no additional funds are available, the caseloads and Contract Payments as currently described shall be renegotiated to reflect total funds available.

 Payment for 2009, 2010 and 2011 shall be adjusted to account for changes in projected caseload and changes in cost. Allowable cost increases include inflationary adjustments to the Kenny Salary Schedule, benefits, rent, and other required operations and maintenance costs and must be approved by the Contract Administrator. Assuming no changes in the level of service, total cost may not increase by more than the rolling average of the CPI-W.

The cost per case and estimated number of cases will be updated annually as described in Section 6 A and as shown in Attachment 2.

 E. Contract Payment includes the Agency's provision of legal advice 24 hours a day 7 days a week via pager (or comparable technology) access and response by phone promptly to any accused adult who is in the investigation phase or recently charged with a misdemeanor offense within the jurisdiction of the City.

A case which was closed and submitted to the Contract Administrator for full payment because the court had issued a bench warrant for the client and had struck all further court dates shall not be considered a new case when that warrant is quashed or served and new hearing dates are set within twelve (12) months of the case closure.

 2. If the warrant is quashed or served and new hearing dates are set more than twelve (12) months after the case was closed, it will be treated as a new case and may be submitted for payment upon case completion.

 H. No payment shall be made for work on cases which are subsequently identified as conflicts with the exception of cases in which the client obtains a new attorney at his own expense or through a request to the Court; or for other extraordinary circumstances approved by the City including, but not limited to, information or evidence which defense counsel could not have reasonably known or discovered at the time of the initial conflicts check. Under these circumstances, payment will be considered if a minimum of two (2) hours of attorney work has been performed.
