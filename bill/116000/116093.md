 ORDINANCE _________________

 AN ORDINANCE concerning indigent public defense services; establishing a process for selecting providers of those services; creating a proposal review panel; setting out standards for those services; establishing contractual requirements for agreements between the City and public defense service providers; requesting the Seattle City Auditor to audit compliance; repealing Ordinance 122493 and Ordinance 121501; and ratifying and confirming certain prior acts.

 WHEREAS, it is a constitutional requirement, a requirement of Chapter 10.101 RCW and a public purpose that each person charged with a crime punishable by incarceration or involved in certain other proceedings that may result in loss of liberty or loss of fundamental rights, be provided with effective legal representation in order to ensure equal justice under law without regard to his or her ability to pay; and

 WHEREAS, effective legal representation should be provided consistent with the constitutional requirements of fairness, equal protection, and due process in all cases where the right to counsel attaches; and

 WHEREAS, it is the intention of The City of Seattle (the "City"), consistent with Chapter 10.101 RCW and other applicable law, to make such services available in an efficient manner that provides effective representation at reasonable cost to the city; and

 WHEREAS, the provision of indigent public defense services by nonprofit service providers helps ensure a client focus by those entrusted with representing indigent persons; and

 WHEREAS, a non-profit board of directors is generally representative of the community it serves, and the City Council and Mayor desire Seattle's public defense program to be representative of the community it serves; and

 WHEREAS, the King County Bar Indigent Defense Services Task Force developed a 300 case per-attorney, per-year guideline in 1982; and

 WHEREAS, the Seattle City Council adopted Resolution 27696 on September 28, 1987, adopting a framework and schedule for implementing recommendations contained in the 1987 Public Defender Salary and Caseload Review conducted by City Council staff, which report led to a 1989 City Council Budget Intent Statement establishing a 380 case per-attorney, per-year limit, and conditions leading to those recommendation have not materially changed; and

 WHEREAS, the City is guided by the standards referenced in Chapter 10.101 RCW and the American Bar Association's (ABA's) Ten Principles of a Public Defense Delivery System; and

 WHEREAS, in 2004, the City Council passed Ordinance 121501, stating that public defense contracts shall require caseloads no higher than 380 cases per-attorney per-year; and

 WHEREAS, in September 2007, the City Council passed Ordinance 122493, stating that public defense contracts shall require caseloads no higher than 380 total assigned cases per-attorney per-year; and

 WHEREAS, a 2007 City of Seattle Audit found that the Office of Policy and Management's (OPM's) method of determining attorney caseload is not an accurate measure of workload and can conflict with the City caseload standard of 380 annual cases per attorney specified in Ordinance 121501; and the Auditor further found that in 2005 and 2006, the current primary public defense agency's caseload exceeded the standard established in Ordinance 121501; and

 WHEREAS, the Audit also commented on OPM's Request for Proposals process, observing that the Mayor appointed all the members of the 2004 proposal review committee, and recommended that the Executive and City Council should decide whether this Mayoral role provides sufficient independence as outlined in the ABA principles; and

 WHEREAS, overall, this 2007 City Audit contains 36 recommendations for improving the City's public defense program, including a recommendation to have a larger secondary public defense agency;

 NOW, THEREFORE,

 BE IT ORDAINED BY THE CITY OF SEATTLE AS FOLLOWS:

 Section 1. Indigent public defense services proposal review panel established; panel appointment, functions and duration.

 a. There is hereby established an indigent public defense services proposal review panel ("panel"), which shall act in an advisory capacity.

 b. The duties of the panel are to review and comment upon the request for proposals (RFP) for indigent public defense services before its issuance, review and comment upon providers' responses to the RFP, and make recommendations concerning the selection of providers.

 c. The panel shall have six members and four alternates, all to be appointed by the Mayor.

 d. The Mayor shall appoint a new panel for each RFP process. Panelists must be appointed before the RFP process for new indigent public-defense services contracts is to begin, [0]

 and will serve only for the duration of that process. However, there is no limit to the number of times a person may be appointed to the panel. Members from the 2007 panel shall not serve on the 2008 panel.

 e. Two panel members and two alternates shall be City employees. Of these, one panel member and one alternate shall have expertise in financial management, and the other panel member and alternate shall have expertise in contract administration. Alternates may serve on the panel when a City employee panel member is prevented from doing so by absence due to illness or other unavoidable reason.

 f. The remaining four panel members and two alternates shall not be City employees. The City will request that the King County Bar Association (KCBA) identify and evaluate potential candidates for these four panel and two alternate positions, and forward to the Mayor a list containing no fewer than six recommended names. The Mayor shall select the four non-City employee panelists and two non- City employee alternates from among the names provided by KCBA. An alternate may serve on the panel when a non-City employee panel member is prevented from doing so by absence due to illness or other reason.

 g. In its recommendations for persons to serve on the panel, KCBA shall attempt to include, but shall not be limited to, lawyers with criminal-defense experience and/or experience in Seattle Municipal Court, community members with legal experience, and those who hold firm the interests of low-income communities.

 h. The following persons may not serve on the panel:

 i. Employees, officers or board members of non-profit indigent public-defense agencies that are responding or are intending to respond to the RFP;

 ii. City attorneys, county prosecutors, and law-enforcement officers and their assistants or deputies; or

 iii. Any person whose service on the panel would constitute a financial conflict of interest.

 Section 2. Standards for indigent public defense services. The City's 1989 Budget Intent Statement, the American Bar Association's (ABA's) Ten Principles of a Public Defense Delivery System, and the provisions of Sections 2 and 3 of this Ordinance shall collectively constitute "standards for public defense services" as that term is used in RCW 10.101.030 until such time as the City Council may by ordinance adjust those standards. A copy of the 1989 Budget Intent Statement is attached to this ordinance as Attachment 1, and is incorporated herein. A copy of the ABA's Ten Principles is attached to this ordinance as Attachment 2, and is incorporated herein.

 Section 3. Supervision standards affirmed. The City affirms the Washington State Bar-endorsed supervision standard of one full-time supervisor for every ten staff lawyers.

 Section 4. Statement of intent concerning future standards for public defense services. The Council and Mayor intend that any future standards for public defense services established by ordinance as contemplated by RCW 10.101.030 relating to "compensation of counsel, duties and responsibilities of counsel, case load limits and types of cases, responsibility for expert witness fees and other costs associated with representation, administrative expenses, support services, reports of attorney activity and vouchers, training, supervision, monitoring and evaluation of attorneys, substitution of attorneys or assignment of contracts, limitations on private practice of contract attorneys, qualifications of attorneys, disposition of client complaints, cause for termination of contract or removal of attorney, and nondiscrimination," shall be made following a comprehensive review that involves the Executive, the City Council, public defenders, law school faculty, KCBA, and non-profit community service providers.

 Section 5. Selecting service providers. After having received the panel's recommendations, the Director of Executive Administration shall select providers for indigent public defense services ("providers"), and negotiate and, upon City Council approval as required by Section 10 of this ordinance, execute contracts with those providers.

 Section 6. Contracts only with non-profit corporations; exception. Except as provided in Section 8 of this Ordinance, the City shall enter into contracts for indigent public defense services only with non-profit corporations formed for the express purpose of providing legal services to persons eligible for representation through a public defense program.

 Section 7. Three providers. The City shall enter into contracts for indigent public defense services with three providers: a primary provider; a secondary provider to handle conflict cases and other cases as may be assigned by the contract administrator; and a third provider to represent defendants in cases in which both the primary and secondary providers have a conflict of interest.

 Section 8. Assigned counsel services. In cases or other proceedings where conflicts of interest or other special circumstances exist at the three providers, the City may provide for assigned counsel services by persons or entities other than nonprofit corporations. The City will enter into an agreement with one of the three providers to administer assigned counsel cases. The City will pay directly, not via any of the three providers, for assigned counsel services provided by persons or entities other than nonprofit corporations.

 Section 9. Contract requirements. City contracts with providers for indigent public-defense services must, among other things, meet the following requirements:

 a. The contract with the primary provider shall require that a minimum of fifteen full-time equivalent attorneys be assigned to Seattle Municipal Court. The contract with the secondary provider shall require that a minimum of seven full-time equivalent attorneys be assigned to Seattle Municipal Court. The contract with the third provider shall require that a minimum of one full-time equivalent attorney be assigned to Seattle Municipal Court.

 b. All contracts must conform to the standards for public defense as established in Sections 2 and 3 of this ordinance, or as may be established by future ordinance.

 c. No contract shall permit a caseload of more than 380 total assigned cases per-attorney per-year.

 d. No contract shall exceed three years in duration.

 Section 10. Approval by ordinance required. No agreement to provide indigent public defense services shall be executed or become effective unless and until approved by the City Council by ordinance.

 Section 11. Audit requested. The City Council requests the Seattle City Auditor to audit compliance in the first quarter of 2010 with the standards established by this Ordinance for the public defense agreements enacted for the 2008 to 2010 period.

 Section 12. Ordinances repealed. Ordinance 122493 and Ordinance 121501 are hereby repealed.

 Section 13. Certain acts ratified. Any act consistent with the authority and prior to the effective date of this ordinance is hereby ratified and confirmed.

 Section 14. Effective date. This ordinance shall take effect and be in force thirty (30) days from and after its approval by the Mayor, but if not approved and returned by the Mayor within ten (10) days after presentation, it shall take effect as provided by Municipal Code Section 1.04.020.

 Attachment 1 to the Ordinance

 City of Seattle 1989 Budget Intent Statement

 LEGISLATIVE INTENT

 In approving the 1989 budget of the Department of Finance General, the City Council expressed the following intent:

 In approving the increased appropriation for Indigent Defense Services, it is the intent of the City Council to recognize the issues of caseload and salary. This increment of $75,000 is to be used to lower the contracting standard from 390 cases per attorney to 380 cases per attorney annually.

 If a public defender program is already meeting the lower standard of 380 cases per FTE attorney, it is the intent of the City Council that the additional increment received by the agency shall be used to raise the average salary of its attorneys practicing in the Municipal Court. OMB shall report to the Council no later than June 30, 1989, on the status of these issues.

 It is the further intent of the Council that OMB shall monitor:

 a. the agencies' performance to ensure that public defenders practicing at Municipal Court carry caseloads no higher than 385 per FTE attorney; and

 b. the experience level of public defenders assigned to Municipal Court.

 Furthermore, it is the intent of the City to continue to work with the County to reach agreement on uniform caseload and salary standards.
