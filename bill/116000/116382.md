 ORDINANCE _________________

 AN ORDINANCE relating to the Firefighters' Pension Fund established under RCW 41.16; amending Ordinances 117216, 118814 and 122293 to suspend contributions to the Actuarial Account for two years beginning in 2009.

 WHEREAS, on July 11, 1994, the City Council passed Ordinance 117216, establishing an Actuarial Account within the Firefighters' Pension Fund; and

 WHEREAS, on November 13, 1997, the City Council passed Ordinance 118814, which clarified the funding plan for the Actuarial Account; and

 WHEREAS, on November 20, 2006, the City Council passed Ordinance 122293, postponing by five years the date by which full funding of the Actuarial Account was to be achieved in recognition of lower interest rates available for investments; and

 WHEREAS, the rapid escalation in salaries for current firefighters has increased the amount needed for the Actuarial Account far beyond the levels envisioned when the Account was originally created; and

 WHEREAS, the Firefighters' Pension Fund is a closed system and has not accepted new members since 1977, thereby limiting the amount of future liability; and

 WHEREAS, interest rates have fallen even further than the 5.125 percent assumed in Ordinance 122293, with the City's investment pool earning only 4.2 percent through August 2008; and

 WHEREAS, the City faces significant financial uncertainty due to the condition of the national economy, turmoil in financial markets, and higher inflation; NOW, THEREFORE,

 BE IT ORDAINED BY THE CITY OF SEATTLE AS FOLLOWS:

 Section 1. Section 1 of Ordinance 117216, as amended by Ordinance 118814, and Ordinance 122293, is further amended as follows:

~~As requested by the Firefighters' Pension Board (the "Board"), t~~The following funding policy is adopted with respect to the Firefighters' Pension Fund (the "Fund"):

 A. Beginning in 1994, the City will place in a separate "Actuarial Account" within the Fund each year an amount which is sufficient to fully amortize as described below the estimated remaining pension liabilities of the Fund by December 31, 2023. The Actuarial Account will be funded as follows:

 1. Each year, the City will appropriate a "Level Payment Amount" to the Fund. The Level Payment Amount is intended to be constant for each year between 1994 and 2023. If necessary, the Level Payment Amount will be modified every two years as specified in subsection A(4) below. Notwithstanding the foregoing, no payments will be made in 2009 and 2010.

 2. In each year, the Level Payment Amount will be the sum of the expected current pension obligations for that year and a contribution to the Actuarial Account. Thus, the transfer to the Actuarial Account may vary in amount from year to year.

 3. In some years, the expected current pension obligations will exceed the Level Payment Amount. In such years, the City will appropriate additional funds to the Fund in order to cover all expected current pension obligations. No contribution will be made to the Actuarial Account in such years.

 4. The actuarial calculations of the Level Payment Amount and of the portion to be contributed to the Actuarial Account shall be performed in a manner consistent with Attachment A to Ordinance 118814.

 5. Beginning in 1998, the Level Payment Amount will be recalculated by June 30 of each even-numbered year by a qualified actuary retained by the Board. While the Level Payment Amount is generally expected to remain constant over time, small variations are likely due to changes in mortality, inflation, and other factors. In addition, the actuary will calculate the expected current pension obligations for each of the two following years. The contribution to the Actuarial Account will be defined as the difference between the Level Payment Amount and the expected current pension obligations for each year. The City will use the actuary's figures in establishing the Level Payment Amount in the biennial budget for the following two (2) years, subject to Board confirmation. In the mid-biennium, the City shall revise the expected current pension obligations based on the actuary's latest estimates, subject to Board confirmation. This may change the contribution to the Actuarial Account in the second year of each biennium depending on any increases or decreases in expected current pension obligations.

 6. In the event that actual current pension obligations for any year exceed the amounts projected by the actuary and included in the budget, the City will appropriate additional amounts to cover any shortfall. Transfers to the Actuarial Account will not be changed once they are included in the Adopted Budget.

 7. Funds in the Actuarial Account are for the purpose of meeting pension obligations and funds will not be transferred from the Actuarial Account for any other purpose unless and until all pension obligations of the Fund have been satisfied.

8. The Department of Finance and the Seattle Firefighters' Pension Board will review actuarial projections in 2010 and will develop recommendations for possible future funding of the Actuarial Account.

 * * *

 Section 2. This ordinance shall take effect and be in force thirty (30) days from and after its approval by the Mayor, but if not approved and returned by the Mayor within ten (10) days after presentation, it shall take effect as provided by Municipal Code Section 1.04.020.
