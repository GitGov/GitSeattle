 AN ORDINANCE related to parking rates; amending Sections 11.16.120 and 11.16.121 of the Seattle Municipal Code and amending Ordinance 121330 to set a new limit on parking rates at parking payment devices.

 WHEREAS, the City's Comprehensive Plan recognizes the importance of paid on-street parking to encourage parking turnover, customer access, and efficient allocation of parking among a diverse group of users; and

 WHEREAS, in 2004, the Seattle Department of Transportation (SDOT) began to replace single-space parking meters with parking pay stations to provide improved parking management, revenue benefits, and customer service and streetscape enhancements; and,

 WHEREAS, by mid-2008, SDOT had installed approximately 1,850 pay stations and controlled about 13,500 paid parking spaces; and

 WHEREAS, Seattle's paid parking pay stations provide convenient payment options for the public, allowing payment to be made by cash, credit card, or debit card; and

 WHEREAS, the Seattle Department of Transportation has started implementing a "performance-based pricing" parking management system in certain areas that includes regular monitoring of parking space utilization and potential adjustments of hourly parking rates or time-limits to achieve desired parking occupancy and other policy goals; and

 WHEREAS, studies by the Seattle Department of Transportation show that on-street parking in many parts of the city with paid parking is full most of the day and, as such, does not provide appropriate access for customers and visitors to downtown and other neighborhood business districts; and

 WHEREAS, Section 11.16.120 of the Seattle Municipal Code was amended in 2003 to allow the Director of Transportation to set parking rates within certain limits and, in 2004, Ordinance 121388 made technical changes to the definition of parking payment devices, but did not intend to alter the authority of the Director to set rates; and

 WHEREAS, it is appropriate to clarify the Director's continued authority to set rates to be charged at parking payment devices and change the limits on that authority; NOW, THEREFORE,
