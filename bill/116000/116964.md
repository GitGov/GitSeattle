 ORDINANCE _________________

 AN ORDINANCE relating to the Department of Finance and Administrative Services; authorizing the Director of Finance and Administrative Services to execute an amendment to a lease agreement with the U.S. General Services Administration for warehouse space at Federal Center South, 4735 East Marginal Way South in Seattle; and ratifying and confirming certain prior acts.

 WHEREAS, Ordinance 122490 authorized the Fleets and Facilities Department, now known as the Department of Finance and Administrative Services, to execute and amend a lease agreement with the United States General Services Administration (GSA) for use and occupancy of certain real property located at 4735 East Marginal Way South in Seattle; and

 WHEREAS, the Seattle Police Department (SPD) has leased warehouse space at Federal Center South since 2006, for the purpose of storing vehicles and equipment obtained as evidence; and

 WHEREAS, the amount of warehouse space SPD needs cannot be accommodated within City-owned buildings now and for the foreseeable future; and

 WHEREAS, Federal Center South is especially suitable to SPD's needs because of the low rental rate and the security available at the site; and

 WHEREAS, in April 2010, SPD reduced the amount of space it occupies at Federal Center South, thereby reducing its cost for the secure warehouse space; and

 WHEREAS, GSA was delayed in providing the City with a recalculated premises area, the Supplemental Lease Agreement is retroactive to April 1, 2010 for an additional three year term, under the same terms and conditions of the Original Lease Agreement, except as previously amended; and

 WHEREAS, Seattle Municipal Code 3.127.020 requires City Council approval of the lease agreement, because the total warehouse square footage leased in one calendar year exceeds 9,000 square feet; NOW, THEREFORE,

 BE IT ORDAINED BY THE CITY OF SEATTLE AS FOLLOWS:

 Section 1. As requested by the Department of Finance and Administrative Services Director and recommended by the Mayor, said Director is hereby authorized to execute, for and on behalf of the City of Seattle, an amendment to a lease agreement with the U.S. General Services Administration, substantially in the form of Attachment 1, attached hereto and identified as "Supplemental Lease Agreement No. 2 to Lease No. GS-10PTE-OL-6-21," providing for the City of Seattle's tenancy and occupancy of a portion of the real property commonly known as Federal Center South, located at 4735 East Marginal Way South in Seattle.

 Section 2. The Supplemental Lease Agreement is intended to be effective as of April 1, 2010. Accordingly, any act consistent with the authority of this ordinance prior to its effective date is hereby ratified and confirmed.

 Section 3. The rental payments contemplated by the terms of the lease agreement authorized in Section 1 hereof shall be charged to the appropriate expenditure allowance or allowances in the budget of the Department of Finance and Administrative Services and shall be reimbursed to that department by the Seattle Police Department.

 Section 4. This ordinance shall take effect and be in force 30 days from and after its approval by the Mayor, but if not approved and returned by the Mayor within ten days after presentation, it shall take effect as provided by Seattle Municipal Code Section 1.04.020.
