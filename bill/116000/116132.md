 AN ORDINANCE approving a work program for study and analysis of the Seattle Streetcar Network Concept and removing a budget proviso that restricts spending on streetcar network analysis.

 WHEREAS, successful streetcar projects throughout the United States have acted as catalysts to develop underutilized areas and attract high ridership levels to this climate-friendly transit alternative; and

 WHEREAS, Seattle's fixed-rail streetcar line connecting the downtown Westlake Transit Hub to the South Lake Union neighborhood opened on December 12, 2007 as part of a plan to revitalize the south lakeshore area; and

 WHEREAS, during the 2008 budget process, the Seattle City Council adopted a proviso that limits spending for streetcar network development to $225,000 until authorized by future ordinance; and

 WHEREAS, conditions of the budget proviso specify the Council's intent to designate a preliminary streetcar network; determine whether any of the work proposed for consultants could be either done directly by or funded by Sound Transit depending on the outcome of the November, 2007 Proposition 1: Roads and Transit ballot; approve a work program for streetcar network development; all prior to authorizing the Seattle Department of Transportation (SDOT) to conduct an analysis of specified segments of the network and lifting the proviso by ordinance; and

 WHEREAS, the Roads and Transit ballot measure was defeated at the polls in November 2007 leaving Sound Transit without additional funds from that ballot measure to do the consultant work related to a streetcar network; and

 WHEREAS, the City Council anticipates that SDOT will analyze the feasibility of the potential streetcar routes identified in the Seattle Streetcar Network Concept (SSNC) and provide Council with the information to assist Council in evaluating the merits of developing a streetcar network; and

 WHEREAS, following the completion of SDOT's analysis, the City Council may make a threshold decision as to whether the City should continue planning for the potential development of a streetcar network; and

 WHEREAS, if the City Council decides that the City should continue developing a streetcar network, it will need to adopt specific conditions that guide SDOT's future route-specific streetcar planning and preliminary engineering before SDOT can proceed; and

 WHEREAS, the conditions of the City Council's budget proviso have been met, including submission of a Resolution designating the preliminary SSNC, which shows potential streetcar corridors from downtown to neighborhoods in the City; NOW, THEREFORE,

 BE IT ORDAINED BY THE CITY OF SEATTLE AS FOLLOWS:

 Section 1. The Seattle Streetcar Network Concept Work Program, included as Exhibit 1, is approved.

 Section 2. The restrictions imposed by the following budget proviso are removed and there are no longer restrictions for any purpose, including for Subsection 1(b) of Ordinance 122560:
