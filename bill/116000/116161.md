 ORDINANCE _________________

 AN ORDINANCE relating to financing certain capital activities of Seattle Department of Transportation; increasing appropriations to the Department of Transportation in the 2008 Budget; and amending the 2008-2013 Capital Improvement Program; all by a three-fourths vote of the City Council.

 WHEREAS, Ordinance 122232 authorized a vote on a property tax levy for transportation improvements that was approved by the voters in November 2006, Ordinance 122191 imposed an employee hours tax for transportation purposes, Ordinance 122192 imposed a commercial parking tax for transportation purposes, and Resolution 30915 collectively referred to these referenced funding sources and the transportation improvements for which the collected revenues will be used as the "Bridging the Gap" (BTG) transportation funding package; and

 WHEREAS, the Mayor has proposed and the City Council has approved a 2008 Budget and 2008-2013 Capital Improvement Program that includes the S Lander St. Grade Separation project; and

 WHEREAS, the Mayor has proposed and the City Council has approved a 2008 Budget and 2008-2013 Capital Improvement Program that includes the Spokane St. Viaduct project; and

 WHEREAS, the Mayor has proposed and the City Council has approved a 2008 Budget and 2008-2013 Capital Improvement Program that includes the Mercer Corridor Project; and

 WHEREAS, due to the failure of Proposition 1, the roads and transit proposal, on the November 2007 ballot, the 2008 Budget and 2008-2013 Capital Improvement Program do not include Regional Transportation Investment District (RTID) revenue, RTID-backed bonds, BTG revenue, or BTG-backed bonds for the S Lander St. Grade Separation project, the Spokane St. Viaduct project, and the Mercer Corridor Project; and

 WHEREAS, it is in the City's best interest to fund and continue implementation of the Spokane St. Viaduct at this time, prior to initiation of the Alaskan Way Viaduct (AWV) replacement project because this project will help lessen the negative impact of the AWV replacement project during construction; and

 WHEREAS, the City Council intends to give limited funding and approval to continue implementation of the Mercer Corridor Project at this time until demonstrated progress is made towards securing state, federal, and private funding; and

 WHEREAS, the City Council agrees with the Executive proposal to not move forward with the S Lander St. Grade Separation project at this time; and

 WHEREAS, the Department of Transportation has developed a revised finance plan for the Spokane St. Viaduct and the Mercer Corridor Project that does not include RTID revenue or RTID-backed bonds; and

 WHEREAS, the revised finance plan for the Spokane St. Viaduct leaves a funding gap of $40 million in currently unsecured funding anticipated from state and federal sources; and

 WHEREAS, the revised finance plan for the Mercer Corridor Project leaves a funding gap of $88 million in currently unsecured funding anticipated from private participation and state and federal sources; and

 WHEREAS, it is the City's intention to work with WSDOT to create a 2- way Mercer Corridor from Dexter west to Elliott and 15th, and the Council supports that intention as our preference as we move forward with this additional project on the Mercer Corridor; and

 WHEREAS, the City Council intends to consider future appropriation authority for the Mercer Corridor Project in the context of whether substantial progress is made toward closing this funding gap, NOW, THEREFORE,

 BE IT ORDAINED BY THE CITY OF SEATTLE AS FOLLOWS:

 Section 1. In order to pay for necessary capital costs and expenses incurred, or to be incurred, but for which insufficient appropriations were made, the appropriations for the following in the 2008 Budget are increased from the fund shown, as follows:

 Fund Department Budget Control Level Amount Transportation Seattle Department Major Projects $25,664,000 Operating Fund of Transportation (19002) (10310)

 Transportation Seattle Department General $1,537,000 Operating Fund of Transportation Expense (18002) (10310)

 Section 2. The 2008-2013 Adopted Capital Improvement Program is hereby amended as shown in Exhibit A with respect to those projects or programs included in Exhibit A.

 Section 3. In accordance with RCW 35.32A.060, the foregoing appropriations are made to meet actual necessary expenditures of the City for which insufficient appropriations have been made due to causes which could not reasonably have been foreseen at the time of the making of the 2008 Budget.

 Section 4. Future appropriation authority related to the Mercer Corridor Project will not be granted until the City Council has had the opportunity to evaluate the Executive's progress toward closing the existing funding gap. To inform this evaluation, the Executive will provide the following information to the City Council:

 1. A fully revised financing plan for both the Spokane St. Viaduct Project and Mercer Corridor Project that includes:

 (a) Revised schedule for anticipated revenues and expenditures; and

 (b) Updated project cost estimates based on 100% design and further value engineering analysis; and

 (c) Documentation of anticipated revenues and supporting information from specific sources of funding that the Executive has characterized as "private participation" in their April 2008 financing plan for the Mercer Corridor Project. These sources should total the equivalent of $36.2 million in funding for the project or reductions or off-sets in project costs. This documentation should verify the actual level of private participation funding realized through real estate acquisition for right of way needs; and

 (d) Documentation of secured revenues or supporting information demonstrating substantial progress toward securing funding in the amounts shown in the Executive's April 2008 financing plan for the Spokane St. Viaduct Project and Mercer Corridor Project from the following sources:

 (i) State or regional funding from the Washington State Department of Transportation, King County Department of Transportation, Freight Mobility Strategic Investment Board and Transportation Improvement Board for both projects; and

 (ii) Federal funding from the Puget Sound Regional Council's distribution of the region's Surface Transportation / Congestion Management & Air Quality (STP/CMAQ) funds, annual earmark appropriations, Safe, Accountable, Flexible, Efficient Transportation Equity Act: A Legacy for Users (SAFETEA-LU) Reauthorization earmarks, and other federal grant sources.

 (iii) A revised assessment of potential sources for grant and partner agency funding and an updated schedule for anticipated revenues from the sources of funding noted in (i) and (ii) above; and

 (e) An assessment of potential need for interim financing in the event external revenues are not secured according to the project schedule; and

 (f) A contingency plan that identifies proposed alternative funding sources in the event that either project fails to secure all anticipated revenues.

 2. Documentation of completed environmental review, including but not limited to the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) Environmental Assessment (EA), technical reports & memoranda, and Finding of No Significant Impacts (FONSI).

 Section 5. This ordinance shall take effect and be in force thirty (30) days from and after its approval by the Mayor, but if not approved and returned by the Mayor within ten (10) days after presentation, it shall take effect as provided by Municipal Code Section 1.04.020.

 This project develops a grade separation of the S Lander St.roadway and the Burlington Northern mainline railroad tracks between First Ave. S and Fourth Ave. S. Previously, City staff evaluated traffic conditions and identified an initial design concept. During the preliminary engineering phase of the project, a consultant conducted a Type, Size and Location study to develop more detailed plans and cost estimates. The project design recommenced in November of 2006, and in January of 2007, survey, geotechnical and scoping of the design work began. The project was put on hold in March 2008 until further funding becomes available.
