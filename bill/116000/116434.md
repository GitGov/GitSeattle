 AN ORDINANCE relating to income thresholds for low-income rate credit qualification for customers of Seattle Public Utilities and Seattle City Light; and amending Seattle Municipal Code Chapter 21.76 and Chapter 21.49, all in connection therewith.

 WHEREAS, the City of Seattle is committed to making its utility services accessible and affordable to low-income customers; and

 WHEREAS, Seattle Public Utilities and Seattle City Light offer rate assistance to low-income customers but have consistently low participation levels, at an estimated twenty (20) percent of eligible households; and

 WHEREAS, Seattle Public Utilities' and Seattle City Light's low-income rate assistance programs have two different income criteria, one for seniors and people with disabilities at seventy (70) percent of state median income, and one for other low-income customers at two hundred (200) percent of the federal poverty level; and

 WHEREAS, research into the incomes that households require to meet basic needs and be self-sufficient indicates many households require assistance even at the higher criterion; and
