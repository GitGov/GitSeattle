 THIS AGREEMENT is by and between THE CITY OF SEATTLE, hereinafter referred to as the City, and the PACIFIC NORTHWEST REGIONAL COUNCIL OF CARPENTERS, hereinafter referred to as the Union.

 ARTICLE 1 - RECOGNITION, BARGAINING UNIT AND TEMPORARY EMPLOYMENT

 1.1 The City recognizes the Pacific Northwest Regional Council of Carpenters as the exclusive collective bargaining representative for the purpose stated in Chapter 108, Extra Session Laws of 1967 of the State of Washington for employees employed within the bargaining unit defined in Appendix A of this Agreement. For purposes of this Agreement, the bargaining unit shall consist of all regular full time, regular part time, temporary full time, temporary part time and probationary employees.

 1.1.1 The term "employee" shall be defined to include probationary employees, regular employees, full-time employees, part-time employees and temporary employees not otherwise excluded or limited in the following Sections of this Article.

 1.1.2 The term "probationary employee" shall be defined as an employee who is within his/her first twelve (12) month trial period of employment following his/her initial regular appointment within the classified service.

 1.1.3 The term "regular employee" shall be defined as an employee who has successfully completed a twelve (12) month probationary period and who has had no subsequent break in service as occasioned by quit, resignation, discharge for just cause, or retirement.

 1.1.4 The term "full-time employee" shall be defined as an employee who has been regularly appointed and who has a usual work schedule of forty (40) hours per week.

 1.1.5 The term "part-time employee" shall be defined as an employee who has been regularly appointed and who has a usual work schedule averaging at least twenty (20) hours but less than forty (40) hours per week.

 1.1.6 The terms temporary employee and temporary worker shall be defined to include both temporary and less than half time employees and means a person who is employed in:

 1. An interim assignment(s) of up to one (1) year to a vacant regular position to perform work associated with a regularly budgeted position that is temporarily vacant and has no incumbent; or

 2. An interim assignment for short-term replacement of a regular employee of up to one (1) year when the incumbent is temporarily absent; or

 3. A short-term assignment of up to one (1) year, which may be extended beyond one year only while the assignment is in the process of being converted to a regular position, to perform work that is not ongoing regular work and for which there is no regularly budgeted position; or

 4. A less than half-time assignment for seasonal, on-call, intermittent or regularly scheduled work that normally does not exceed one thousand forty (1040) hours in a year, but may be extended up to one thousand three hundred (1300) hours once every three years and may also be extended while the assignment is in the process of being converted to a regular position; or

 5. A term-limited assignment for a period of more than one (1) but less than three (3) years for time-limited work related to a specific project, grant or other non-routine substantial body of work, or for the replacement of a regularly appointed employee when that employee is absent on long-term disability time loss, medical or military leave of absence.

 1.1.6.1 Temporary Employees - When the city needs additional employees, it reserves the right to hire from its own recruiting sources. Generally, however, this practice shall include a call to the Union.

 1.1.7 Temporary workers in the following types of assignments shall cease receiving premium pay at the time indicated and begin receiving wage progression and benefits as provided in SMC 4.20.055 D:

 1.1.7.1 Interim and short term assignments after one thousand forty (1,040) regular straight time hours for the remainder of the assignment unless the Personnel Director determines that the assignment will terminate so imminently that the benefits package would be of minimal value to the worker.

 1.1.7.2 Term-limited assignments starting with the first day and for the duration of the assignment.

 1.1.7.3 Any assignment that the appointing authority has proposed be converted to regular position authority regardless of the number of hours worked.

 1.2 Temporary employees shall be exempt from all provisions of this Agreement except Sections 1.2; 1.2.1; 1.2.2; 1.2.2.1; 1.2.2.2; 1.2.3; 1.2.4; 1.2.5; 1.2.6; 1.2.7; 1.2.8; 1.2.9; 1.2.10; 1.2.10.1, 1.2.11; 1.2.12, 1.2.13, 1.2.14; 1.2.15; 3.1.1; 5.1.1; 5.1.2; 5.1.3; 5.2; 5.4.2; 5.6; 5.6.2 (only applies if Temporary Employees are benefited); 14.5; 14.5.1; 14.6.3; 14.10; 14.11; 14.12; 14.13; 14.18; and Article 20, Grievance Procedure; provided however, temporary employees shall be covered by the Grievance Procedure solely for purposes of adjudicating grievances relating to Sections identified within this Section. Where the provisions in Personnel Rule 11 do not conflict with the expressed provisions of this Agreement, the Personnel Rule 11 shall apply and be subject to the grievance procedure as provided for in Article 20.

 1.2.1 Temporary employees who are not in benefits-eligible assignments shall be paid for all hours worked at the first Pay Step of the hourly rates of pay set forth within the appropriate Appendix covering the classification of work in which he/she is employed. Temporary employees who are in a benefits-eligible assignment shall receive step increases consistent with Article 4.2.1 and 4.2.4 and 4.2.5.

 1.2.2 Premiums Applicable Only To City Of Seattle Temporary Employees who are not in benefits-eligible assignments - Each temporary employee shall receive premium pay as hereinafter set forth based upon the corresponding number of cumulative non-overtime hours worked by the temporary employee unless the employee is in a benefits eligible assignment:

 0001st hour through 0520th hour 5% premium pay

 0521st hour through 1,040th hour 10% premium pay

 1,041st hour through 2,080th hour 15% premium pay (If an employee worked 800 hours or more in the previous twelve [12] months, they shall receive twenty percent [20%] premium pay.)

 2,081st hour + 20% premium pay (If an employee worked eight hundred [800] hours or more in the previous twelve [12] months, they shall receive twenty-five percent [25%] premium pay.)

 The appropriate percentage premium payment shall be applied to all gross earnings.

 1.2.2.1 Once a temporary employee reaches a given premium level, the premium shall not be reduced for that temporary employee as long as the employee continues to work for the City without a voluntary break in service as set forth within Section 1.2.8. Non-overtime hours already worked by an existing temporary employee shall apply in determining the applicable premium rate. In view of the escalating and continuing nature of the premium, the City may require that a temporary employee be available to work for a minimum number of hours or periods of time during the year.

 1.2.2.2 The premium pay in Section 1.2.2 does not include either increased vacation pay due to accrual rate increases or the City's share of any retirement contributions. Any increase in a temporary employee's vacation accrual rate percentage shall be added on to the premium pay percentages for the temporary employee to whom it applies.

 1.2.3 Medical, Dental and Vision Coverage to Temporary Employees who are not in Benefits-Eligible Positions - Once a temporary employee has worked at least one thousand forty (1,040) cumulative non- overtime hours and at least eight hundred (800) non-overtime hours or more in the previous twelve (12) months, the employee may within ninety (90) calendar days thereafter elect to participate in the City's medical, dental and vision insurance programs by agreeing to pay the required monthly premium. To participate, the temporary employee must agree to a payroll deduction equal to the amount necessary to pay the monthly health care premiums, or the City, at its discretion, may reduce the premium pay of the employee who chooses this option in an amount equal to the insurance premiums. The temporary employee must continue to work enough hours each month to pay the premiums and maintain eligibility. After meeting the requirements stated in this Section, a temporary employee shall also be allowed to elect this option during any subsequent open enrollment period allowed regular employees. An employee who elects to participate in these insurance programs and fails to make the required payments in a timely fashion shall be dropped from City medical, dental and vision coverage and shall not be able to participate again while employed by the City as temporary unless he or she is converted from receiving premium pay to receiving benefits. If a temporary employee's hours of work are insufficient for their pay to cover the insurance premium, the temporary employee may, on no more than one occasion, pay the difference, or self-pay the insurance premium, for up to three (3) consecutive months.

 1.2.4 Holiday Work for Non-Benefits-Eligible Temporary Employees - A temporary employee who works on any of the specific calendar days designated by the City as paid holidays shall be paid at the rate of one and one-half (11/2) times his/her regular straight-time hourly rate of pay for hours worked during his/her scheduled shift. When a specific holiday falls on a weekend day and most regular employees honor the holiday on the preceding Friday or following Monday adjacent to the holiday, the holiday premium pay of one and one-half (11/2) times the employee's regular straight-time rate of pay shall apply to those temporary employees who work on the weekend day specified as the holiday.

 1.2.5 Benefits-Eligible Temporary Employee Holiday Pay - A temporary employee shall be compensated at his or her straight-time rate of pay for all officially recognized City holidays that occur subsequent to the employee becoming eligible for fringe benefits, for as long as he or she remains in such eligible assignment.

 1. To qualify for a holiday pay, the employee must be on active pay status the normally scheduled workday before or after the holiday as provided by Section 6.2

 2. Officially recognized City holidays that fall on Saturday shall be observed on the preceding Friday. Officially recognized City holidays that fall on Sunday shall be observed on the following Monday. If the City's observance of a holiday falls on a temporary employee's normal day off, he or she shall be eligible for another day off, with pay during the same workweek.

 3. Temporary employees who work less than 80 hours per pay period shall have their holiday pay pro-rated based on the number of straight-time hours compensated during the preceding pay period.

 4. A temporary employee shall receive two personal holidays immediately upon becoming eligible for fringe benefits, provided he or she has not already received personal holidays in another assignment within the same calendar year.

 5. Personal holidays cannot be carried over from calendar year to calendar year, nor can they be cashed out.

 6. A temporary employee must use any personal holidays before his or her current eligibility for fringe benefits terminates. If a employee requests and is denied the opportunity to use his or her personal holidays during the eligibility assignment, the employing unit must permit him or her to use and be compensated for the holidays immediately following the last day worked in the assignment, prior to termination of the assignment.

 1.2.6 Premium pay set forth within Section 1.2.2 shall be in lieu of the base level of vacation and all other fringe benefits, such as sick leave, holiday pay, funeral leave, military leave, jury duty pay, disability leave, and medical and dental insurance, except as otherwise provided in Sections 1.2.2.2, 1.2.3, and 1.2.4.

 1.2.7 The City may, at any time after ninety (90) calendar days' advance notification to and upon consultation with the affected collective bargaining representatives, provide all fringe benefits covered by the premium pay set forth within Section 1.2.2 to all or some groups (departmental or occupational) of temporary employees to the same extent that they are available to regular employees within the same group, and in such event the premium pay provision in Section 1.2.2 shall no longer be applicable to that particular group of temporary employees. The City, at its discretion, may also after ninety (90) calendar days' advance notification to and upon consultation with the affected collective bargaining representatives, provide paid vacation and/or sick leave benefits to all or some groups (departmental or occupational) of temporary employees to the same extent that they are available to regular employees without providing other fringe benefits and in such event the premium pay in Section 1.2.2 shall be reduced by a percentage amount equivalent to the value of vacation and/or sick leave benefits. The applicable amount for base-level vacation shall be recognized as four point eight one percent (4.81%) which could be higher dependent upon accrual rate increases. The applicable amount for base-level sick leave shall be four point six percent (4.6%). The City shall not use this option to change to and from premiums and benefits on an occasional basis. The City may also continue to provide benefits in lieu of all or part of the premiums in Section 1.2.2 where it has already been doing so and it may in such cases reduce the premium paid to the affected employees by the applicable percentage.

 1.2.8 A temporary employee who is assigned to a benefits eligible assignment will receive fringe benefits in-lieu-of premium pay until the assignment is converted or terminated.

 1.2.9 The premium pay provisions set forth within Section 1.2.2 shall apply to cumulative non-overtime hours that occur without a voluntary break in service by the temporary employee. A voluntary break in service shall be defined as quit, resignation, service retirement or failure to return from an unpaid leave. If the temporary employee has not worked for at least one year (twelve [12] months or twenty-six [26] pay periods), it shall be presumed that the employee's break in service was voluntary.

 1.2.10 The City may work temporary employees beyond one thousand forty (1,040) regular hours within any twelve (12) month period; provided however, the City shall not use temporary employees to supplant regular positions. The City shall not assign or schedule temporary employees (or fail to do so) solely to avoid accumulation of regular hours that would increase the premium pay provided for in Section 1.2.2, or solely to avoid considering creation of regular positions.

 1.2.10.1 In the event that an interim assignment of a temporary employee to a vacant regular position accrues more than one thousand five hundred (1500) hours or accumulates hours in eighteen (18) or more consecutive pay periods, the City shall notify the union that a labor-management meeting shall take place within two (2) weeks for the purpose of discussing the status of filling the vacant position prior to one (1) year.

 1.2.11 A temporary employee who has worked in excess of five hundred twenty (520) regular hours and who is appointed to a regular position without a voluntary break in service greater than thirty (30) days shall have his/her time worked counted for purposes of salary step placement (where appropriate). In addition, a temporary employee who is in a term-limited assignment shall receive service credit for layoff purposes if the employee is immediately hired (within thirty (30) business days without a break in service) into the same job title and position after the term is completed.

 1.2.12 Temporary employees covered by this Agreement who have worked for the City for one thousand forty (1,040) hours, without a break in service are eligible to apply for all positions advertised internally.

 1.2.13 A temporary employee who has worked one thousand forty (1,040) straight-time hours and is receiving benefits from the City may by mutual agreement be allowed to accrue compensatory time if the work unit in which the temporary employee is assigned has a practice/policy of accruing compensatory time. Scheduling compensatory time shall be by mutual agreement with the supervisor. If the temporary employee does not use his or her accrued compensatory time prior to the termination of the benefits eligible assignment, the compensatory time will be cashed out upon termination of the assignment.

 1.2.14 A temporary employee who receives fringe benefits in-lieu-of premium pay may be eligible for the sick leave transfer program.

 1.2.15 On an annual basis, the City will provide the Union with a copy of the Temporary Employee Utilization Report.

 1.3 The City may establish on-the-job training program(s) in a different classification and/or within another bargaining unit for the purpose of providing individuals an opportunity to compete and potentially move laterally and/or upwardly into new career fields. Prior to implementation of such a program(s) relative to bargaining unit employees, the City shall discuss the program(s) with the appropriate Union or Unions and the issue of bargaining unit jurisdiction and/or salary shall be a proper subject for negotiations at that time upon the request of either party.

 1.4 As part of its public responsibility, the City may participate in or establish public employment programs to provide employment and/or training for and/or service to the City by various segments of its citizenry. Such programs may result in individuals performing work for the City which is considered bargaining unit work pursuant to RCW 41.56. Such programs have included and may include youth training and/or employment programs, adult training and or employment programs, vocational rehabilitation programs, work-study and student- intern programs, court-ordered community service programs, volunteer programs and other programs with similar purposes. Some examples of such programs already in effect include Summer Youth Employment Program (SYEP), Youth Employment Training Program (YETP), Work-Study, Adopt-a-Park, Seattle Conservation Corps, and court-ordered Community Service. Individuals working for the City pursuant to such programs shall be exempt from all provisions of this Agreement.

 1.4.1 The City shall have the right to implement new public employment programs or expand its current programs beyond what exists as of the signature date of this Agreement, but where such implementation or expansion involves bargaining unit work and results in a significant departure from existing practice, the City shall give thirty (30) days' advance written notice to the union of such and upon receipt of a written request from the Union thereafter, the City shall engage in discussions with the Union on concerns raised by the Union. Notwithstanding any provision to the contrary, the expanded use of individuals under such a public employment program which involves the performance of bargaining unit work within a given City department, beyond what has traditionally existed, shall not be a cause of (1) a layoff of regular employees covered by this Agreement, or (2) the abrogation of a regular budgeted full-time position covered by this Agreement that recently had been occupied by a regular full-time employee who performed the specific bargaining unit work now being or about to be performed by an individual under one of the City's public employment programs.

 1.5 An employee who is worked out of classification or who is promoted on an interim basis from a classification falling under one bargaining unit to another bargaining unit shall remain under the jurisdiction of the initial bargaining unit until such time as his/her promotion becomes permanent.

 ARTICLE 2 - NON DISCRIMINATION

 2.1 The City and the Union shall not unlawfully discriminate against any employee by reason of race, creed, age, color, sex, national origin, religious belief, marital status, sexual orientation, gender identity, veteran status, political ideology, ancestry or the presence of any sensory, mental or physical handicap unless based on a bona fide occupational qualification reasonably necessary to the operations of the City.

 2.1.1 Wherever words denoting a specific gender are used in this Agreement, they are intended and shall be construed so as to apply equally to either gender.

 ARTICLE 3 - UNION MEMBERSHIP AND DUES

 3.1 It shall be a condition of employment that each employee covered by this Agreement shall become and remain a member in good standing of the United Brotherhood of Carpenters and Joiners of America on or before the thirtieth (30th) day of employment. Failure by any such employee to apply for and/or maintain such membership in accordance with this provision shall constitute cause for discharge of such employee; provided however, the requirements to apply for Union membership and/or maintain union membership shall be satisfied by the employee's payment of the regular initiation fee or regular re- initiation fee and the regular dues uniformly required by the Union of its members.

 3.1.1 A temporary employee may, in lieu of the Union membership requirements set forth within Section 3.1, pay a Union service fee for all hours worked within the bargaining unit each biweekly pay period, commencing with the thirty-first (31st) day following the temporary employee's first date of assignment to perform bargaining unit work.

 3.1.2 Employees who are determined by the Public Employment Relations Commission to satisfy the religious exemption requirements of RCW 41.56.122 shall contribute an amount equivalent to regular union dues and initiation fees to a non-religious charity or to another charitable organization mutually agreed upon by the employee affected and the bargaining representative to which such employee would otherwise pay the regular monthly dues.

 3.2 Failure by an employee to abide by the afore-referenced provisions of this Article shall constitute cause for discharge of such employee; provided however, it shall be the responsibility of the Union to notify the City in writing when it is seeking discharge of an employee for non-compliance with Sections 3.1 or 3.1.1 or 3.1.2 of this Article. When an employee fails to fulfill the union security obligations set forth within this Article, the Union shall forward a "Request For Discharge Letter" to the affected Department Head (with copies to the affected employee and the City Director of Labor Relations). Accompanying the Discharge Letter shall be a copy of the letter to the employee from the Union explaining the employee's obligation under Article 3, Sections 3.1 or 3.1.1 or 3.1.2.

 3.2.1 The contents of the "Request For Discharge Letter" shall specifically request the discharge of the employee for failure to abide by Sections 3.1 or 3.1.1 or 3.1.2 of Article 3, but provide the employee and the City with thirty (30) calendar days' written notification of the Union's intent to initiate discharge action, during which time the employee may make restitution in the amount which is overdue. Upon receipt of the Union's request, the affected Department Head shall give notice in writing to the employee, with a copy to the Union and the City Director of Labor Relations that the employee faces discharge upon the request of the Union at the end of the thirty (30) calendar day period noted in the Union's "Request For Discharge Letter" and that the employee has an opportunity before the end of said thirty (30) calendar day period to present to the affected department any information relevant to why the Department should not act upon the Union's written request for the employee's discharge.

 3.2.2 In the event the employee has not yet fulfilled the obligation set forth within Sections 3.1 or 3.1.1 or 3.1.2 of this Article within the thirty (30) calendar day period noted in the Request For Discharge Letter, the Union shall thereafter reaffirm in writing to the affected Department Head, with copies to the affected employee and the Director of Labor Relations, its original written request for discharge of such employee. Unless sufficient legal explanation or reason is presented by the employee why discharge is not appropriate or unless the Union rescinds its request of the discharge the City shall, as soon as possible thereafter, effectuate the discharge of such employee. If the employee has fulfilled the union security obligation within the thirty (30) calendar day period, the Union shall so notify the affected Department Head in writing, with a copy to the City Director of Labor Relations and the affected employee. If the Union has reaffirmed its request for discharge, the affected Department Head shall notify the Union in writing, with a copy to the City Director of Labor Relations and the affected employee, that the Department effectuated the discharge and the specific date such discharge was effectuated, or that the Department has not discharged the employee, setting forth the reasons why it has not done so.

 3.3 The City shall deduct from the pay check of each employee who has so authorized it, the regular initiation fee and regular monthly dues uniformly required of members of the Union or the alternative biweekly Union service fees required of temporary employees per Section 3.1.1. The amounts deducted shall be transmitted monthly to the Union on behalf of the employees involved. The Union shall indemnify and save harmless the City against any and all liability resulting from dues deductions.. If an improper deduction is made, the Union shall refund directly to the employee any such amount. Authorization by the employee shall be on a form approved by the parties hereto and may be revoked by the employee upon request.

 ARTICLE 4 - CLASSIFICATIONS AND RATES OF PAY

 4.1 The classifications of employees covered under this Agreement and the corresponding rates of pay are set forth within Appendix "A" which is attached hereto and made a part of this Agreement.

 4.1.1 Effective January 9, 2008, the base wage rates, as displayed in the Appendix of this Agreement will be increased 3.8%.

 4.1.2 Effective January 7, 2009, the base wage rates, as displayed in the Appendix of this Agreement will be increased 4.5%.

 4.1.3 Effective January 6, 2010, wages will be increased by 100% of the annual average growth rate of the bi-monthly Seattle-Tacoma- Bremerton Area Consumer Price Index for Urban Wage Earners and Clerical Workers (CPI-W) for the period August 2007 through June 2008 to the period August 2008 through June 2009.

 4.1.4 For year 2010, the percentage increases shall be at least two percent (2%) and not more than seven percent (7%).

 4.1.5 The base wage rates referenced above shall be calculated by applying the appropriate percentage increase to base hourly rates or as otherwise provided for herein.

 4.1.6 In the event the "Consumer Price Index" becomes unavailable for purposes of computing any one of the afore-referenced increases, the parties shall jointly request the Bureau of Labor Statistics to provide a comparable index for purposes of computing such increase and if that is not satisfactory, the parties shall promptly undertake negotiations solely with respect to agreeing upon a substitute formula for determining a comparable adjustment.

 4.2 An employee, upon first appointment or assignment shall receive the minimum rate of the salary range fixed for the position as set forth in the Appendix.

 4.2.1 An employee shall be granted the first automatic step increase in salary rate upon completion of six (6) months of "actual service" when hired at the first step of the salary range, and succeeding automatic step increases shall be granted after twelve (12) months of "actual service" from the date of eligibility for the last step increase to the maximum of the range. Actual service for purposes of this Section shall be defined in terms of one month's service for each month of full-time employment, including paid absences. This provision shall not apply to temporary employees prior to regular appointment, except as otherwise provided for in Section 1.2.11 and except that step increments in the out-of-class title shall be authorized when a step increase in the primary title reduces the pay differential to less than what the promotion rule permits, provided that such increment shall not exceed the top step of the higher salary range. Further, when an employee is assigned to perform out- of-class duties in the same title for a total of twelve (12) months (each 2088 hours) of actual service, he/she will receive one-step increment in the higher-paid title; provided that he/she has not received a step increment in the out-of-class title based on changes to the primary pay rate within the previous twelve (12) months, and that such increment does not exceed the top step of the higher salary range. However, hours worked out-of-class that were properly paid per Article 5.9 of this Agreement, shall apply toward salary step placement if the employee's position is reclassified to the same title as the out-of-class assignment within twelve (12) months of the end of such assignment.

 4.2.2 Those employees who have been given step increases for periodic "work outside of classification" prior to the effective date of this Agreement shall continue at that step but shall not be given credit for future step increases, except as provided for in Section 4.2.1.

 4.2.3 For employees assigned salary steps other than the beginning step of the salary range, subsequent salary increases within the salary range shall be granted after twelve (12) months of actual service from the appointment or increase, then at succeeding twelve (12) month intervals to the maximum of the salary range established for the class.

 4.2.4 In determining actual service for advancement in salary step, absence due to sickness or injury for which the employee does not receive compensation may at the discretion of the City be credited at the rate of thirty (30) calendar days per year. Unpaid absences due to other causes may, at the discretion of the City, be credited at the rate of fifteen (15) calendar days per year. For the purposes of this Section, time lost by reason of disability for which an employee is compensated by Industrial Insurance or Charter disability provisions shall not be considered absence. An employee who returns after layoff, or who is reduced in rank to a position in the same or another department, may be given credit for such prior service.

 4.2.5 Any increase in salary based on service shall become effective upon the first day immediately following completion of the applicable period of service.

 4.2.6 Changes in Incumbent Status Transfers - An employee transferred to another position in the same class or having an identical salary range shall continue to be compensated at the same rate of pay until the combined service requirement is fulfilled for a step increase and shall thereafter receive step increases as provided in Section 4.2.1.

 4.2.7 Promotions - An employee appointed to a position in a class having a higher maximum salary shall be paid at the nearest step in the higher range which (1) provides the employee who is not at the top step of his/her current salary range a dollar amount at least equal to the next step increase of the employee's current salary range, or (2) provides the employee who is at the top step of his/her current salary range an increase in pay through placement at the salary step in the new salary range which is closest to a four percent (4%) increase, provided that such increase shall not exceed the maximum step established for the higher-paying position; and provided further, that this provision shall apply only to appointments of employees from regular full-time positions and shall not apply to appointments from positions designated as "intermittent" or "as needed". However, hours worked out-of-class shall apply toward salary step placement if the employee is appointed to the same title as the out-of-class assignment within twelve (12) months of the end of such assignment.

 4.2.8 An employee demoted because of inability to meet established performance standards from a regular full-time or part-time position to a position in a class having a lower salary range shall be paid the salary step in the lower range determined as follows:

 - If the rate of pay received in the higher class is above the maximum salary for the lower class, the employee shall receive the maximum salary of the lower range.

 - If the rate of pay received in the higher class is within the salary range for the lower class, the employee shall receive that salary rate for the lower class which, without increase, is nearest to the salary rate to which such employee was entitled in the higher class; provided however, the employee shall receive not less than the minimum salary of the lower range.

 4.2.9 An employee reduced because of organizational change or reduction in force from a regular full-time or part-time position to a position in a class having a lower salary range shall be paid the salary rate of the lower range which is nearest to the salary rate to which he/she was entitled in his/her former position without reduction; provided however, such salary shall in no event exceed the maximum salary of the lower range. If an employee who has completed twenty-five (25) years of City service and who within five (5) years of a reduction in lieu of layoff to a position in a class having a lower salary range, such employee shall receive the salary he/she was receiving prior to such second reduction as an "incumbent" for so long as he/she remains in such position or until the regular salary for the lower class exceeds the "incumbent" rate of pay.

 4.2.10 When a position is reclassified by ordinance to a new or different class having a different salary range, the employee occupying the position immediately prior to and at the time of reclassification shall receive the salary rate which shall be determined in the same manner as for a promotion; provided however, if the employee's salary prior to reclassification is higher than the maximum salary of the range for such new or different class, he/she shall continue to receive such higher salary as an "incumbent" for so long as he/she remains in position or until the regular salary for the classification exceeds the "incumbent" rate of pay.

 4.2.11 Correction of Payroll Errors - In the event it is determined there has been an error in an employee's paycheck, an underpayment shall be corrected within two pay periods; and, upon written notice, an overpayment shall be corrected as follows:

 A. If the overpayment involved only one (1) paycheck;

 1. by payroll deductions spread over two (2) pay periods; or

 2. by payments from the employee spread over two (2) pay periods.

 B. If the overpayment involved multiple paychecks, by a repayment schedule through payroll deduction not to exceed twenty-six (26) pay periods in duration, with a minimum payroll deduction of not less than twenty-five dollars ($25) per pay period.

 C. If an employee separates from the City service before an overpayment is repaid, any remaining amount due the City will be deducted from his/her final paycheck(s).

 D. By other means as may be mutually agreed between the City and the employee, the union representative may participate in this process at the request of the involved employee. All parties will communicate/cooperate in resolving these issues.

 ARTICLE 5 - HOURS OF WORK AND OVERTIME

 5.1 Hours Of Work - Eight (8) hours within nine (9) consecutive hours shall constitute a normal workday. There shall be no split work shifts. Work schedules shall normally consist of five (5) consecutive days followed by two (2) consecutive days' off, except for relief shift assignments, four (4) day/ten- (10) hour work schedules and other special schedules.

 5.1.1 Meal Period - Employees shall receive a meal period which shall commence no less than two (2) hours nor more than five (5) hours from the beginning of the employee's regular shift or when he/she is called in to work on his/her regular day off. The meal period shall be no less than one-half (1/2) hour nor more than one (1) hour in duration and shall be without compensation. Should an employee be required to work in excess of five (5) continuous hours from the commencement of his/her regular shift without being provided a meal period, the employee shall be compensated two (2) times the employee's straight-time hourly rate of pay for the time worked during his/her normal meal period and be afforded a meal period at the first available opportunity during working hours without compensation.

 5.1.2 Rest Breaks - Employees shall receive a fifteen (15) minute rest break during the first four (4) hour period of their workday, and a second fifteen (15) minute rest break during the second four (4) hour period in their workday. Employees shall be compensated at their prevailing wage rate for time spent while on rest breaks.

 5.1.3 Where work conditions require continuous manning throughout a work shift for thirty (30) consecutive days or more the City may, in lieu of the meal period and rest periods set forth within Sections 5.1.1 and 5.1.2, provide a working meal period and working rest periods during working hours without a loss in pay so that such periods do not interfere with ongoing work requirements.

 5.2 Overtime - All time worked in excess of eight (8) hours in any one (1) shift shall be paid for at the rate of two (2) times the straight-time rate of pay.

 5.2.1 All time worked before an employee's regularly scheduled starting time shall be paid for at the rate of two (2) times the straight-time rate of pay.

 5.2.2 All time worked on an employee's regularly scheduled days off shall be paid for at the rate of two (2) times the straight-time rate of pay.

 5.2.3 Overtime shall be paid at the applicable overtime rate or by mutual consent between the employee and his/her supervisor in compensatory time off at the applicable overtime rate.

 5.2.4 A "work week" for purposes of determining whether an employee exceeds forty (40) hours in a work week shall be a seven (7) consecutive day period of time beginning on Wednesday and ending on

 Tuesday except when expressly designated to begin and end on different days and times from the normal Wednesday through Tuesday work week.

 5.2.5 All overtime work shall be offered to qualified regular employees in the classification before any temporary employees are asked to work overtime.

 5.2.6 When deemed necessary by the City, the City may require an employee to perform work outside of his/her regularly scheduled work shift. The immediate circumstance of the situation shall be considered by the City in deciding which employee(s) shall be assigned to perform the overtime work in question. Overtime assignments shall be allotted in as fair and equitable manner as circumstances will permit amongst employees in an affected work unit who have the work experience to immediately perform the overtime work. When an unforeseen situation arises which necessitates overtime work either as an extension of a shift or as a call-in, the City may assign or call in the first individual(s) it contacts for such overtime work.

 5.3 Call Back - Employees who are called back to work after completing their regular shift shall be paid a minimum of four (4) hours straight-time pay for all time worked up to two (2) hours. Any time worked in excess of two (2) hours shall be paid for at double the straight-time rate of pay for actual hours worked.

 Example: Zero (0) minutes to two (2) hours = four (4) hours' straight-time pay. Two and one-half (21/2) hours = five (5) hours straight-time pay. Four (4) hours = eight (8) hours straight-time pay.

 5.3.1 Definition of a Call Back - A Call Back shall be defined as a circumstance where an employee has left the work premises at the completion of his/her regular work shift and is required to report back to work prior to the start of his/her next regularly scheduled work shift. An employee who is called back to report to work before the commencement of his/her regular work shift shall be compensated in accordance with the Call Back provisions of his/her Labor Agreement; provided however, in the event he/she is called back to report to work within two (2) hours from the starting time of his/her next regularly scheduled work shift, he/she shall be compensated at the overtime rate of pay for only those hours immediately preceding the start of his/her next regularly scheduled work shift and the Call-Back provision shall not apply.

 5.4 Meal Reimbursement - When an employee is specifically directed by the City to work two (2) hours or longer at the end of his/her normal work shift of at least eight (8) hours or work two (2) hours or longer at the end of his/her work shift of at least eight (8) hours when he/she is called in to work on his/her regular day off, or otherwise works under circumstances for which meal reimbursement is authorized per Ordinance 111768 and the employee actually purchases a reasonably priced meal away from his place of residence as a result of such additional hours of work, the employee shall be reimbursed for the "reasonable cost" of such meal in accordance with Seattle Municipal Code (SMC) 4.20.325. In order to receive reimbursement, the employee must furnish the City with a dated original itemized receipt from the establishment indicating the time of the meal no later than forty-eight (48) hours from the beginning of his/her next regular shift; otherwise, the employee shall be paid a minimum of ten dollars ($10) in lieu of reimbursement for the meal.

 5.4.1 To receive reimbursement for a meal under this provision, the following rules shall be adhered to:

 (1) Said meal must be eaten within two (2) hours after completion of the overtime work. Meals shall not be saved, consumed and claimed at

 some later date.

 (2) In determining "reasonable cost" the following shall also be considered:

 - The time period during which the overtime is worked.

 - The availability of reasonably priced eating establishments at that time.

 (3) The City shall not reimburse for the cost of alcoholic beverages.

 5.4.2 In lieu of any meal compensation as set forth within this Section, the City may, at its discretion, provide a meal.

 5.4.3 When an employee is called out in an emergency to work two (2) hours or longer of unscheduled overtime immediately prior to his/her normal eight (8) hour work shift, said employee shall be eligible for meal reimbursement pursuant to Sections 5.4, 5.4.1 and 5.4.2; provided however, if the employee is not given time off to eat a meal within two (2) hours after completion of the overtime, the employee shall be paid a minimum of ten dollars ($10) in lieu of reimbursement for the meal. Any time spent consuming a meal during working hours shall be without compensation

 5.4.4 Meal reimbursement while on Travel Status. An employee shall be reimbursed for meals while on travel status at the federal per diem rate. An employee will not be required to submit receipts for meals and may retain any unspent portion of an advance cash allowance for meals.

 5.5 When management deems it necessary, work schedules may be established other than Monday through Friday; provided however, that where workweeks other than the basic departmental workweek schedules in force on the effective date of this Agreement are deemed necessary, the change(s) and reason therefore shall be provided to the Union at least forty-eight (48) hours in advance and, upon request, such change(s) shall be discussed with the Union. At least forty-eight (48) hours advance notification shall be afforded the Union and the affected employees when shift changes are required by the City. In instances where forty-eight (48) hours advance notification is not provided to an employee, said employee shall be compensated at the overtime rate of pay for the first shift worked under the new schedule.

 5.6 Implementation of a four (4) day, forty (40) hour or other alternative work schedule shall be subject to consultation and agreement with the Union involved. In administering the four (4) day, forty (40) hour work schedule or other alternative work schedule, overtime shall be paid for any hours worked in excess of ten (10) hours per day or forty (40) hours per week. It will be clearly established whether an alternative work schedule is applicable for a temporary employee.

 5.6.1 For employees who work a four (4) day, forty (40) hour work week or other alternative work schedule, the following shall apply:

 If a holiday is observed on a Saturday or on a Friday that is the normal day off, the holiday will be taken on the last normal workday. If a holiday is observed on a Monday that is the normal day off or on a Sunday, the holiday will be taken on the next normal workday. This schedule will be followed unless the employee and his/her supervisor determine that some other day will be taken off for the holiday; provided, however, that in such case the holiday time must be used no later than the end of the following pay period. If the holiday falls on a Tuesday, Wednesday, or Thursday that is the employee's normal scheduled day off, the holiday must be scheduled off no later than the end of the following pay period.

 5.6.2 Employees, including those on alternate work schedules, shall receive 8 hours pay per holiday (except as identified in 6.1.2. and 6.2.

 Employees working an alternate work schedule during a holiday work week are permitted to make scheduling or pay status adjustments as follows:

 1. Employees may revert back to a 5-day/40 hour work week, in which the holidays falls, if available.

 2. Employees may use vacation or compensatory time to supplement the 8-hour holiday pay to achieve full pay for the work week without making other scheduling adjustments, or at the employees' discretion, to be unpaid.

 3. By mutual agreement, pre-arranged between the employee and his or her supervisor, employees may work beyond their normally scheduled workday hours to make up holiday hours. These holiday make-up hours will not be counted as overtime and must be worked during the work week in which the holiday fails. In the event that a request for a modified holiday work week schedule cannot be accommodated, such denial shall not be arbitrary or capricious.

 NOTE: Past practice with regard to holiday pay for employees on alternate work assignments consistent with the 1991 directive on holiday pay will continue.

 5.7 Any past, present or future work schedule in which an employee, by action of the City, receives eight (8) hours pay for less than eight (8) hours work per day may be changed by the City, at any time, so as to require such an employee to work eight (8) hours per day for eight (8) hours pay.

 5.8 Standby Duty - Whenever an employee is placed on Standby Duty by the City, the employee shall be available to respond to emergency calls and when necessary, report as directed. Employees who are placed on Standby Duty by the City shall be paid at a rate of ten percent (10%) of the employee's straight-time hourly rate of pay. When an employee is required to return to work while on Standby Duty the Standby Duty pay shall be discontinued for the actual hours on work duty and compensation shall be provided in accordance with Section 5.3.

 5.9 Work Outside of Classification - Effective upon the signature date of this Agreement, work out of class is a management tool, the purpose of which is to complete essential public services whenever an employee is assigned by proper authority to perform the normal, ongoing duties of and accept responsibility of a position. When the duties of the higher-paid position are clearly outside the scope of an employee's regular classification for a period of three (3) hours or longer in any one (1) work week, he/she shall be paid at the out- of-class salary rate while performing such duties and accepting such responsibility. The out-of-class rate shall be determined in the same manner as for a promotion. Proper authority shall be a supervisor and/or Crew Chief, who has been designated the authority by a manager or director directly above the position which is being filled out of class, and who has budget management authority of the work unit. The City shall have the sole authority to direct its supervisors as to when to assign employees to a higher classification. Employees must meet the minimum qualifications of the higher class, and must have demonstrated or be able to demonstrate their ability to perform the duties of the class. (If an employee is mistakenly assigned out-of-class who does not meet the above qualifications, the City will stop the practice immediately once discovered and will see that the out-of-class is paid for work already performed.) The City may work employees out of class across bargaining unit jurisdictions for a period not to exceed six (6) continuous months for any one position. The six (6) month period may be exceeded under the following circumstances: 1) when a hiring freeze exists and vacancies cannot be filled; 2) extended industrial or off-the-job injury or disability; 3) when a position is scheduled for abrogation; or 4) a position is encumbered (an assignment in lieu of a layoff; e.g., with the renovation of the Seattle Center Coliseum). When such circumstances require that an out-of-class assignment be extended beyond six (6) months for any one position, the City shall notify the union or unions which represent the employee who is so assigned and/or the body of work which is being performed on an out-of-class basis. After nine (9) months, the union which represents the body of work being performed out of class must concur with any additional extension of the assignment. The union that represents the body of work will consider all requests on a good faith basis.

 5.9.1 The practice of no out-of-class pay for paid leave will continue.

 5.9.2 An employee may be temporarily assigned to perform the duties of a lower classification without a reduction in pay. When employees voluntarily apply for and voluntarily accept a position in a lower- level classification, they shall receive the salary rate for the lower class, which, without increase, is nearest to the salary rate to which such employee was entitled in the higher class. For such temporary period, the employee shall continue to pay dues to the union of the higher class. The overtime provisions applicable are those of the contract covering the bargaining unit position of the work being performed on an overtime basis. At management's discretion, an employee may be temporarily assigned the duties of a lower-level class, or the duties of a class with the same pay rate range as his/her primary class, across union jurisdictional lines, with no change to his or her regular pay rate. Out-of-class provisions related to threshold for payment, salary step placement, service credit for salary step placement and payment for absences do not apply in these instances.

 5.9.3 An employee who is temporarily unable to perform the regular duties of his/her classification due to an off-the-job injury or illness may opt to perform work within a lower-paying classification dependent upon the availability of such work and subject to the approval of the City. The involved employee shall receive the salary rate for the lower class which, without increase, is nearest to the salary rate to which such employee was entitled in the higher class.

 5.9.4 The City shall make a reasonable effort to accommodate employees who have an off-the-job injury or illness with light-duty work if such work is available.

 5.9.5 Out-of-class work shall be formally assigned in advance of the out-of-class opportunity created in normal operating conditions. Where the work is not authorized in advance, it is the responsibility of the proper authority to determine immediately how to accomplish the duties which would otherwise constitute an out-of-class assignment. Any employee may request that this determination be made. The employee will not carry out any duty of the higher-level position when such duty is not also a duty of his or her own classification, if the employee is not formally assigned to perform the duties on an out-of-class basis.

 No employee may assume the duties of the higher-paid position without being formally assigned to do so except in a bona fide emergency. When an employee has assumed an out-of-class role in a bona fide emergency, the individual may apply to his or her department director for retroactive payment of out-of-class pay. The decision of the department director as to whether the duties were performed and whether performance thereof was appropriate shall be final.

 ARTICLE 6 - HOLIDAYS

 6.1 The following days, or days in lieu thereof, shall be recognized as paid holidays:

 New Year's Day January 1st Martin Luther King, Jr.'s Birthday 3rd Monday in January President's Day 3rd Monday in February Memorial Day Last Monday in May Independence Day July 4th Labor Day 1st Monday in September Veteran's Day November 11th Thanksgiving Day 4th Thursday in November Day After Thanksgiving Day Day after Thanksgiving Day Christmas Day December 25th Two Personal Holidays (0-9 years of service) Four Personal Holidays (after completion of 18,720 regular hours)

 6.1.1 Whenever any paid holiday falls upon a Sunday, the following Monday shall be recognized as the paid holiday. Whenever any paid holiday falls upon a Saturday, the preceding Friday shall be recognized as the paid holiday; provided however, paid holidays falling on Saturday or Sunday shall be recognized and paid pursuant to Section 6.4 on those actual days (Saturday or Sunday) for employees who are regularly scheduled to work those days. Payment pursuant to Section 6.4 shall be made only once per affected employee for any one holiday.

 6.1.1.1 Employees who have either:

 1. completed eighteen thousand seven hundred and twenty (18,720) hours or more on regular pay status (Article 7.2) or

 2. are accruing vacation at a rate of .0615 or greater (Article 7.13)

 on or before December 31st of the current year shall receive an additional two (2) personal holidays for a total of four (4) personal holidays (per Article 6.1) to be added to their leave balance on the pay date of the first full pay period in January of the following year.

 6.1.2 A permanent part-time employee shall receive paid holiday time off (or paid time off in lieu thereof) based upon straight-time hours compensated during the pay period immediately prior to the pay period in which the holiday falls. The amount of paid holiday time off for which the part-time employee is eligible shall be in proportion to the holiday time off provided for full-time employees. For example, a full-time employee working eighty (80) hours per pay period would be eligible for eight (8) hours off with pay on a holiday while a part-time employee who works forty (40) hours during the pay period preceding the holiday would be eligible for four (4) hours off with pay.

 6.2 To qualify for holiday pay, City employees shall have been on pay status their normal workday before or their normal workday following the holiday; provided however, employees returning from non-pay leave who start work the day after a holiday shall not be entitled to pay for the holiday preceding their first day of work.

 6.3. A Personal Holiday shall be used during the calendar year as a regular holiday. Use of the Personal Holiday shall be requested in advance. When the Personal Holiday has been approved in advance and is later canceled by the City with less than a thirty (30) day advance notice, the employee shall have the option of rescheduling the day or receiving holiday premium pay pursuant to Section 6.4 for all time worked on the originally scheduled Personal Holiday.

 6.4 An employee who has been given at least forty-eight (48) hours advance notification and who is required to work on a holiday shall be paid for the holiday at his/her regular straight-time hourly rate of pay and, in addition, he/she shall receive one and one-half (11/2) times his/her regular straight-time hourly rate of pay for those hours worked on the holiday; or by mutual agreement between the affected employee and the City, the employee may receive one and one- half (11/2) times those hours worked in the form of compensatory time off to be taken at another mutually agreed-upon date.

 6.5 In the event an employee is required to work without having been given at least a forty-eight (48) hours advance notification on a holiday he/she normally would have off with pay, said employee shall be paid for the holiday at his/her regular straight-time hourly rate of pay and, in addition, he/she shall receive two (2) times his/her regular straight-time hourly rate of pay for those hours worked on the holiday; or by mutual agreement between the affected employee and the City, the employee may receive two (2) times those hours worked in the form of compensatory time off to be taken at another mutually agreed-upon date.

 ARTICLE 7 - ANNUAL VACATION

 7.1 Annual vacations with pay shall be granted to eligible employees computed at the rate shown in Section 7.3 for each hour on regular pay status as shown on the payroll, but not to exceed eighty (80) hours per pay period.

 7.2 Regular pay status is defined as regular straight-time hours of work plus paid time off such as vacation time, holiday time off, compensatory time and sick leave. At the discretion of the City, up to one hundred sixty (160) hours per calendar year of unpaid leave of absence may be included as service for purposes of accruing vacation. Time lost by reasons of disability for which an employee is compensated by Industrial Insurance or Charter Disability provisions shall not be considered absence. An employee who returns after layoff shall be given credit for such prior service.

 7.3 The vacation accrual rate shall be determined in accordance with the rates set forth in Column No. 1. Column No. 2 depicts the corresponding equivalent annual vacation for a regular full-time employee. Column No. 3 depicts the maximum number of vacation hours that can be accrued and accumulated by an employee at any time.

 7.4 An employee who is eligible for vacation benefits shall accrue vacation from the date of entering City service or the date upon which he/she became eligible and may accumulate a vacation balance which shall never exceed at any time two (2) times the number of annual vacation hours for which the employee is currently eligible. Accrual and accumulation of vacation time shall cease at the time an employee's vacation balance reaches the maximum balance allowed and shall not resume until the employee's vacation balance is below the maximum allowed.

 7.5 Employees may, with Department approval, use accumulated vacation with pay after completing one thousand forty (1,040) hours on regular pay status.

 7.6 In the event that the City cancels an employee's already scheduled and approved vacation, leaving no time to reschedule such vacation before the employee's maximum balance will be reached, the employee's vacation balance will be permitted to exceed the allowable maximum and the employee shall continue to accrue vacation for a period of up to three (3) months if such exception is approved by both the Department Head and the Personnel Director in order to allow rescheduling of the employee's vacation. In such cases the Department Head shall provide the Personnel Director with the circumstances and reasons leading to the need for such an extension. No extension of this grace period shall be allowed.

 7.7 "Service year" is defined as the period of time between an employee's date of hire and the one year anniversary date of the employee's date of hire or the period of time between any two (2) consecutive anniversaries of the employee's date of hire thereafter.

 7.8 The minimum vacation allowance to be taken by an employee shall be one-half (1/2) of a day, or at the discretion of the Department Head, such lesser amount as may be approved by the Department Head.

 7.9 An employee who separates from City service for any reason after more than six (6) months' service, shall be paid in a lump-sum for any unused vacation he/she has accrued.

 7.10 Upon the death of an employee in active service, pay shall be allowed for any vacation earned in the preceding year and in the current year and not taken prior to the death of such employee.

 7.11 Where an employee has exhausted his/her sick leave balance, the employee may use vacation for further leave for medical reasons subject to verification by the employee's medical care provider. Employees who are called to active military service or who respond to requests for assistance from Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) may, at their option, use accrued vacation in conjunction with a leave of absence.

 7.12 The Department Head shall arrange vacation time for employees on such schedules as will least interfere with the functions of the department but which accommodate the desires of the employees to the greatest degree feasible.

 7.13 Employees with prior regular City service who are appointed to regular positions within the City shall begin accruing vacation at the rate which was applicable upon their most recent separation from regular City service. Regular City service (on or before December 31, 1992) in the Seattle-King County Health Department will be considered as City service.

 ARTICLE 8 - SICK LEAVE, FUNERAL LEAVE AND EMERGENCY LEAVE AND VEBA

 8.1 Sick Leave - Regular employees shall accumulate sick leave credit at the rate of .046 hours for each hour on regular pay status as shown on the payroll, but not to exceed forty (40) hours per week. New employees entering City service shall not be entitled to sick leave with pay during the first thirty (30) days of employment but shall accumulate sick leave credits during such thirty (30) day period. Sick leave credit may be used by the employee for bona fide cases of:

 - Illness or injury which prevents the employee from performing his/her regular duties.

 - Disability of the employee due to pregnancy and/or childbirth.

 - Medical or dental appointments for the employee.

 - Care of family members as required of the City by State law and/or as defined and provided for by City of Seattle ordinance, which may be repealed in whole or in part by an initiative, in which case the parties shall renegotiate this provision in accordance with the terms of Article 21.

 8.1.1 Abuse of sick leave shall be grounds for suspension or dismissal.

 8.1.2 Unlimited sick leave credit may be accumulated.

 8.1.3 Upon retirement, twenty-five percent (25%) of an employee's unused sick leave credit accumulation can be applied to the payment of health care premiums or to a cash payment at the straight-time rate of pay of such employee in effect on the day prior to his retirement.

 8.1.3.1 Cash payments of unused sick leave may be deferred for a period of one (1) year or less, providing the employee notifies the Department Personnel Office of his/her desires at the time of retirement. Request for deferred cash payments of unused sick leave shall be made in writing.

 8.1.5 Change in position or transfer to another City department shall not result in loss of accumulated sick leave. An employee reinstated or re-employed within one (1) year in the same or another department after termination of service, except after dismissal for cause, resignation or quitting, shall be credited with all unused sick leave accumulated prior to such termination.

 8.1.6 Compensation for the first four (4) consecutive workdays of absence shall be paid upon approval of the Personnel Director or his/her designee. In order to receive compensation for such absence, employees make themselves available for such reasonable investigation, medical or otherwise, as the Personnel Director or his/her designee may deem appropriate. Compensation for such absences beyond four (4) consecutive workdays shall be paid only after approval of the Personnel Director or his/her designee of a request from the employee supported by a report of the employee's physician. The employee shall provide himself/herself with such medical treatment or take such other reasonable precautions as necessary to hasten recovery and provide for an early return to duty.

 8.1.7 Conditions Not Covered - Employees shall not be eligible for sick leave when:

 - Suspended or on leave without pay and when laid off or on other non-pay status.

 - Off work on a holiday.

 - An employee works during his free time for an Employer other than the City of Seattle and his/her illness or disability arises therefrom.

 8.1.8 Prerequisites For Payment - The following applicable requirements shall be fulfilled in order to establish an employee's eligibility for sick leave benefits.

 8.1.8.1 Prompt Notification - The employee shall promptly notify the immediate supervisor, by telephone or otherwise, on the first day off due to illness and each day thereafter unless advised otherwise by the immediate supervisor. For those absences of more than one day, notification on his/her first day off with an expected date of return shall suffice. The employee shall advise the supervisor of any change in expected date of return. If an employee is on a special work schedule, particularly where a relief replacement is necessary when the employee is absent, the employee shall notify the immediate supervisor as far as possible in advance of the scheduled time to report for work.

 8.1.8.2 Notification While On Paid Vacation Or Compensatory Time Off - If an employee is injured or is taken ill while on paid vacation or compensatory time off, he/she shall notify his/her department on the first day of disability. However, if it is physically impossible to give the required notice on the first day, notice shall be sent as soon as possible and shall be accompanied by an acceptable showing of reasons for the delay. A doctor's statement or other acceptable proof of illness or disability, while on vacation or compensatory time off, must be presented regardless of the number of days involved.

 8.1.8.3 Filing Application - Unless there are extenuating circumstances, the employee shall submit the required application for sick leave pay within sixteen (16) working hours after his/her return to duty. However, if he/she is absent because of illness or injury for more than eighty (80) working hours, he/she shall then file an application for an indefinite period for time. The necessary forms shall be available to the employee through his/her Department Supervisor.

 8.1.8.4 Claims To Be In 15 Minute Increments - Sick leave shall be claimed in 15 minute increments to the nearest full 15 minute increment, a fraction of less than 8 minutes being disregarded. Separate portions of absence interrupted by a return to work shall be claimed on separate application forms.

 8.1.8.5 Limitations Of Claims - All sick leave claims shall be limited to the actual amount of time lost due to illness or disability. The total amount of sick leave claimed in any pay period by an employee shall not exceed the employee's sick leave accumulation as shown on the payroll for the pay period immediately preceding his/her illness or disability. It is the responsibility of his/her department to verify that sick leave accounts have not been overdrawn; and if a claim exceeds the number of hours an employee has to his/her credit, the department shall correct his/her application.

 8.1.8.6 Sick Leave Transfer Program - Employees shall be afforded the option to transfer and/or receive sick leave in accordance with the terms and conditions of the City's Sick Leave Transfer Program as established and set forth by City Ordinance. All benefits and/or rights existing under such program may be amended and/or terminated at any time as may be determined appropriate by the City. All terms, conditions and/or benefits of such program shall not be subject to the grievance procedure.

 8.2 Bereavement/Funeral Leave - Regular employees shall be allowed one (1) day off without salary deduction for bereavement purposes in the event of the death of any close relative; provided however, where attendance at a funeral requires total travel of two hundred (200) miles or more, one (1) additional day with pay shall be allowed; provided further, the Department Head may, when circumstances require and upon application stating the reasons therefore, authorize for such purpose not to exceed an additional four (4) days chargeable to the sick leave account of the employee, but no combination of paid absence under this Section shall exceed five (5) days for any one (1) period of absence. In like circumstances and upon like application the Department Head may authorize for the purpose of attending the funeral of a relative other than a close relative, a number of days off work not to exceed five (5) days chargeable to the sick leave account of an employee. For purposes of this Section, the term "close relative" shall mean the spouse or domestic partner, child, mother, stepmother, father, stepfather, brother, sister, grandchild, grandfather or grandmother of the employee or spouse or domestic partner, and the term "relative other than a close relative" shall mean the uncle, aunt, cousin, niece, nephew or the spouse or domestic partner of the brother, sister, child or grandchild of the employee or spouse or domestic partner.

 8.2.1 Bereavement/funeral leave may be allowed for bereavement purposes and/or attendance at the funeral of any other relative as allowed by Seattle Municipal Code (SMC) 4.28.020. Such relatives shall be determined as close relatives or relatives other than close relatives pursuant to the terms of SMC 4.28.020 for purposes of determining the extent of Bereavement/Funeral leave or sick leave allowable as provided for in Section 8.2. In the event SMC 4.28.020 is repealed in whole or in part by an initiative, the parties shall renegotiate this provision in accordance with the terms of Article 21.

 8.3 Emergency Leave - One (1) day or a portion thereof per Agreement year without loss of pay may be taken off subject to approval of the employee's Supervisor and/or Department Head when it is necessary that the employee be immediately off work to attend to one of the following situations, either of which necessitates immediate action on the part of the employee:

 The employee's spouse, child, parent, or domestic partner has unexpectedly become seriously ill or has had a serious accident; or

 An unforeseen occurrence with respect to the employee's household (e.g., fire or flood or ongoing loss of power). "Household" shall be defined as the physical aspects of the employee's residence.

 The "day" of emergency leave may be used for two separate incidents. The total hours compensated under this provision, however, shall not exceed eight (8) in a contract year.

 8.4 Upon advance notice, the City may approve a bargaining unit member's request for unpaid leave of absence for purposes of attending a Union convention or similar Union event.

 8.5 Employees who are eligible to retire during the term of this contract shall participate in a vote administered by the union to determine if the Voluntary Employee Benefits Association (VEBA) benefit shall be offered to employees who elect to retire during the term of this contract. The VEBA benefit allows employees who are eligible to retire from City Service to cash out their unused sick leave balance upon retirement and place it in a VEBA account to be used for post-retirement healthcare costs as allowed under IRS regulations.

 a. Eligibility-to-Retire Requirements:

 * 5 - 9 years of service and are age 62 or older

 * 10 - 19 years of service and are age 57 or older

 * 20 - 29 years of service and are age 52 or older

 * 30 years of service and are any age

 For purposes of identifying all potential eligible-to-retire employees, the City shall create a list of members who are in the City's HRIS system as age 45 or older as of the final day of the contract term and provide this list to the union so that the union can administer the vote.

 1. If the eligible-to-retire members of the bargaining unit vote to accept the VEBA, then all members of the bargaining unit who retire during the term of this contract, shall either:

 a. place their sick leave cashout at 35% into their VEBA account, or

 b. forfeit the sick leave cash out altogether. There is no minimum threshold for the sick leave cash out.

 Members are not eligible to deposit their sick leave cashout into their deferred compensation account or receive cash.

 2. If the eligible-to-retire members of the bargaining unit vote to reject the VEBA, all members of the bargaining unit who retire during the term of this contract shall be ineligible to place their sick leave cashout into a VEBA account. Instead, these members shall have two choices:

 a. Members can cash out their sick leave balance at 35% and deposit those dollars into their deferred compensation account. The annual limits for the deferred compensation contributions as set by the IRS would apply; or

 b. Members can cash out their sick leave balance at 25% and receive the dollars as cash on their final paycheck.

 8.6 Sabbatical Leave and VEBA: Members of a bargaining unit that votes to

 accept the VEBA and who meet the eligible-to-retire criteria are not eligible to cash out their sick leave at 25% as a part of their sabbatical benefit. Members who do not meet the eligible-to-retire criteria may cash out their sick leave at 25% in accordance with the sabbatical benefit.

 ARTICLE 9 - INDUSTRIAL INJURY OR ILLNESS

 9.1 Any employee who is disabled in the discharge of his/her duties and if such disablement results in absence from his/her regular duties, shall be compensated, except as otherwise hereinafter provided, in the amount of eighty percent (80%) of the employee's normal hourly rate of pay, not to exceed two hundred and sixty-one (261) regularly scheduled workdays counted from the first regularly scheduled workday after the day of the on-the-job injury; provided the disability sustained must qualify the employee for benefits under State Industrial Insurance and Medical Aid Acts.

 9.1.1 Whenever an employee is injured on the job and compelled to seek immediate medical treatment, the employee shall be compensated in full for the remaining part of the day of injury without effect to his/her sick leave or vacation or other paid leave account. Scheduled workdays falling within only the first three (3) calendar days following the day of injury shall be compensable through accrued sick leave. Any earned vacation or other paid leave may be used in a like manner after sick leave is exhausted, provided that, if neither accrued sick leave nor accrued vacation or other paid leave is available, the employee shall be placed on no pay status for these three (3) days. If the period of disability equals or extends beyond fourteen (14) calendar days, then (1) any accrued sick leave, vacation, or other paid leave utilized due to absence from his/her regular duties as provided for in this section shall be reinstated and the employee shall be paid in accordance with Section 9.1 which provides payment at the eighty percent (80%) rate, or (2) if no sick leave, vacation, or other paid leave was available to the employee at that time, then the employee shall thereafter be compensated for the three (3) calendar days at the eighty percent (80%) compensation rate described in Section 9.1.

 9.1.2 Such compensation shall be authorized by the Personnel Director or his/her designee with the advice of such employee's Department Head on request from the employee supported by satisfactory evidence of medical treatment of the illness or injury giving rise to such employee's claim for compensation under SMC 4.44, as now or hereinafter amended.

 9.1.3 In no circumstances will the amount paid under these provisions exceed an employee's gross pay minus mandatory deductions (taxes, retirement). This provision shall become effective when SMC 4.44 - Disability Compensation is revised to incorporate this limit.

 9.1.4 Employees must meet the standards listed in SMC 4.44.020 to be eligible for the benefit amount provided herein which exceeds the rate required to be paid by state law, hereinafter referred to as supplemental benefits. These standards require that employees: (1) comply with all Department of Labor and Industries rules and regulations and related City of Seattle and employing department policies and procedures; (2) respond, be available for and attend medical appointments and treatments and meetings related to rehabilitation, and work hardening, conditioning or other treatment arranged by the City and authorized by the attending physician; (3) accept modified or alternative duty assigned by supervisors when released to perform such duty by the attending physician; (4) attend all meetings scheduled by the City of Seattle Workers' Compensation unit or employing department concerning the employee's status or claim when properly notified at least five (5) working days in advance of such meeting unless other medical treatment conflicts with the meeting and the employee provides twenty-four (24) hours' notice of such meeting or examination.

 The City will provide a copy of the eligibility requirements to employees when they file a workers' compensation claim. If records indicate two (2) no-shows, supplemental benefits may be terminated no sooner than seven (7) calendar days after notification to the employee.

 9.2 Compensation for holidays and earned vacation falling within a period of absence due to such disability shall be at the normal rate of pay, but such days shall not be considered as regularly scheduled workdays as applied to the time limitations set forth within Section 9.1. Disabled employees affected by the provisions of SMC 4.44 shall continue to accrue vacation and sick leave as though actively employed during the period set forth within Section 9.1.

 9.3 Any employee eligible for the benefits provided by SMC 4.44 whose disability prevents him/her from performing his/her regular duties, but in the judgment of his/her physician could perform duties of a less strenuous nature, shall be employed at his/her normal rate of pay in such other suitable duties as the Department Head shall direct, with the approval of such employee's physician until the Personnel Director requests closure of such employee's claim pursuant to SMC 4.44, as now or hereinafter amended.

 9.4 Sick leave shall not be used for any disability herein described except as allowed in Section 9.1.

 9.5 The afore-referenced disability compensation shall be understood to be in lieu of State Industrial Insurance Compensation and Medical Aid.

 9.6 Appeals of any denials under this Article shall be made through the Department of Labor and Industries as prescribed in Title 51 R.C.W.

 9.7 The parties agree either may reopen for negotiation the terms

 and conditions of this Article.

 10.2.2 An employee shall become regular after having completed his/her probationary period unless the individual is dismissed under provisions of Section 10.3 and Section 10.3.1.

 10.3 Probationary Period/Dismissal - An employee may be dismissed during his/her probationary period after having been given written notice five (5) working days prior to the effective date of dismissal.

The reasons for the dismissal shall be filed with the Director of Personnel and a copy sent to the Union.

 10.3.1 An employee dismissed during his/her probationary period shall not have the right to appeal the dismissal.

If a regular employee or an employee who is still serving a trial service period is subsequently appointed in the same classification from one department to another, the receiving department may, with the approval of the Personnel Director, require that a twelve (12) month trial service period be served in that department.

 10.5.1 If a probationary employee is subsequently appointed to a different classification in the same or different department, the employee shall serve a complete twelve (12) month probationary period in the new classification. If a regular employee is subsequently appointed to a different classification in the same or different department, the employee shall serve a complete twelve (12) month trial service period in the new classification.

 10.5.2 Within the same department, if a regular employee is appointed to a higher classification while serving in a trial service period, the trial service period for the lower classification and the new trial service period for the higher classification shall overlap provided that the higher and lower classifications are in the same or a closely related field.

Occasional absences due to illness, vacations, jury duty, and military leaves shall not result in an extension of the probationary period, but upon approval of the Personnel Director, an employee's probationary period may be extended so as to include the equivalent of a full twelve (12) months of actual service where there are numerous absences.

 10.7 Nothing in this Article shall be construed as being in conflict with provisions of Article 11.

 ARTICLE 11 - TRANSFERS, VOLUNTARY REDUCTION, LAYOFF AND RECALL

 11.1.1 Intra-departmental Transfers - An appointing authority may transfer an employee from one position to another position in the same class in his/her department without prior approval of the Personnel Director, but must report any such transfer to the Personnel Department within five (5) days of its effective date.

 11.1.2 Other transfers may be made upon consent of the appointing authorities of the departments involved and with the Personnel Director's approval as follows:

 (1) Transfer in the same class from one department to another.

 (2) Transfer to another class in the same or a different department in case of injury in line of duty either with the City service or with the armed forces in time of war, resulting in permanent partial disability, where showing is made that the transferee is capable of satisfactorily performing the duties of the new position.

 (3) Transfer, in lieu of layoff, may be made to a position in the same class to a different department, upon showing that the transferee is capable of satisfactorily performing the duties of the position, and that a regular, trial service or probationary employee is not displaced. The employee subject to layoff shall have this opportunity to transfer provided there is no one on the Reinstatement Recall List for the same class for that department. If there is more than one employee eligible for transfer in lieu of layoff in the same job title, the employee names shall be placed on a layoff transfer list in order of job class seniority. Eligibility to choose this opportunity to transfer is limited to those employees who have no rights to other positions in the application of the layoff language herein including Section 11.3.4.

 A department will be provided with the names of eligible employees and their job skills. The department will fill the position with the most senior employee with the job skills needed for the position. The department may test or otherwise affirm the employee has the skills and ability to perform the work.

 An employee on the layoff transfer list who is not placed in another position prior to layoff shall be eligible for placement on the Reinstatement Recall List pursuant to Section 11.4.

 (4) Transfer, in lieu of layoff, may be made to a single position in another class in the same or a different department, upon showing that the transferee is capable of satisfactorily performing the duties of the position, and that a regular, trial service or probationary employee is not displaced.

 (6) The Personnel Director may approve a transfer under Sections 11.1.2 (1), (2), (3), (4) or (5) above with the consent of the appointing authority of the Receiving Department only, upon a showing of the circumstances justifying such action.

 (7) Transfer may be made to another similar class with the same maximum rate of pay in the same or a different department upon the Director's approval of a written request by the appointing authority.

 11.1.2.1 Employees transferred pursuant to the provisions of Section 11.1.2 shall serve probationary and/or trial service periods as may be required in Article 10, Sections 10.5, 10.5.1, 10.5.2, and 10.5.3.

 11.2.1 The employee so reduced shall be entitled to credit for previous regular service in the lower class and to other service credit in accordance with Section 11.5. Upon a showing, concurred in by the appointing authority of the department that the reason for such voluntary reduction no longer exists, the Personnel Director may restore the employee to his/her former status.

 11.3 Layoff - The City shall notify the Union and the affected employees in writing at least two (2) weeks in advance whenever possible, when a layoff is imminent within the bargaining unit.

 11.3.1 Layoff - Layoff for purposes of this Agreement shall be defined as the interruption of employment and suspension of pay of any regular, trial service or probationary employee because of lack of work, lack of funds or through reorganization. Reorganization when used as a criterion for layoff under this Agreement shall be based upon specific policy decision(s) by legislative authority to eliminate, restrict or reduce functions or funds of a particular department.

 11.3.2 In a given class in a department, the following shall be the order of layoff:

 (1) Interim appointees

 (2) Temporary or intermittent employees not earning service credit.

 (3) Probationary employees*

 (4) Trial service employees* (who cannot be reverted in accordance with Section 10.4.2.)

 (5) Regular employees* in order of their length of service, the one with the least service being laid off first.

 * Except as their layoff may be affected by military service.

 11.3.3 However, the City may lay off out of the order described above for one or more of the reasons cited below:

 (1) Upon showing by the appointing authority that the operating needs of the department require a special experience, training, or skill.

 (2) When (1) women or minorities are substantially underrepresented in an "EEO" category within a department; or (2) a planned layoff would produce substantial underrepresentation of women or minorities; and (3) such layoff in normal order would have a negative, disparate impact on women or minorities; then the Personnel Director shall make the minimal adjustment necessary in the order of layoff in order to prevent the negative disparate impact.

 11.3.4 At the time of layoff, a regular employee or a trial service employee (per 11.3.2 above) shall be given an opportunity to accept reduction (bump) to the next lower class in a series of classes in his/her department or he/she may be transferred as provided in Section 11.1.2(3). An employee so reduced shall be entitled to credit for any previous regular service in the lower class and to other service credit in accordance with Section 11.5.

 11.4.1 Anyone on a Reinstatement Recall List who becomes a regular employee in the same class in another department shall lose his/her reinstatement rights in his/her former department.

 11.4.2 Refusal to accept work from a Reinstatement Recall List shall terminate all rights granted under this Agreement; provided, no employee shall lose reinstatement eligibility by refusing to accept appointment in a lower class.

 11.4.3 If a vacancy is to be filled in a given department and a Reinstatement Recall List for the classification for that vacancy contains the names of eligible employees who were laid off from that classification, the following shall be the order of the Reinstatement Recall List:

 (1) Regular employees laid off from the department having the vacancy in the order of their length of service. The regular employee on the Reinstatement Recall List who has the most service credit shall be first reinstated.

 (2) Trial service employees laid off from the department having the vacancy in the order of their length of service. The trial service employee on the Reinstatement Recall List who has the most service credit shall be first reinstated.

 (3) Probationary employees laid off from the department having the vacancy without regard to length of service. The names of all these probationary employees shall be listed together on the Reinstatement Recall List.

 (4) Regular employees laid off from the same classification in another City department and regular employees on a Layoff Transfer

 List. The regular employee on this combined list who has the most service credit and who has the job skills necessary for the vacant position will be offered employment on a trial basis in said vacancy. The trial service provisions of Article 10, Section 10.4 shall apply.

 (5) Trial service employees laid off from the same classification in another City department and trial service employees on a Layoff Transfer List. The trial service employee on this combined list who has the most service credit and who has the job skills necessary for the vacant position will be offered employment on a trial basis in said vacancy. The trial service provisions of Article 10, Section 10.4 shall apply.

 (6) Probationary employees laid off from the same classification in another City department and probationary employees on the Layoff Transfer List without regard to length of service. The names of all these probationary employees shall be listed together on the Reinstatement Recall List.

 (7) The City may recall laid-off employees out of the order described above upon showing by the appointing authority that the operating needs of the department require such experience, training, or skill.

 (8) The Joint Crafts Council agrees that employees from other bargaining units whose names are on the Reinstatement Recall List for the same classifications shall be considered in the same manner as employees of these bargaining units provided the Union representing those employees has agreed to a reciprocal right to employees of these bargaining units. Otherwise, this section shall only be applicable to those positions that are covered by this Agreement.

 11.4.4 Nothing in this Article shall prevent the reinstatement of any regular, trial service, or probationary employee for the purpose of appointment to another lateral title or for voluntary reduction in class as provided in this Article.

 11.5 For purposes of layoff, service credit in a class for a regular employee shall be computed to cover all service subsequent to their regular appointment to a position in that class and shall be applicable in the department in which employed and specifically as follows:

 (1) After completion of the probationary period, service credit shall be given for employment in the same, equal or higher class, including service in other departments and shall include temporary or intermittent employment in the same class under regular appointment prior to permanent appointment.

 17.2 Delivery of municipal services in the most efficient, effective and courteous manner is of paramount importance to the City, and as such, maximized productivity is recognized to be an obligation of employees covered by this Agreement. In order to achieve this goal, the parties hereby recognize the City's right to determine the methods, processes and means of providing municipal services, to increase, diminish or change municipal equipment, including the introduction of any and all new, improved or automated methods or equipment, the assignment of employees to a specific job within the bargaining unit, the right to temporarily assign employees to a specific job or position outside the bargaining unit, and the right to determine appropriate work out-of-class assignments.

 17.4 The City agrees that performance standards shall be reasonable.

 ARTICLE 18 - SUBORDINATION OF AGREEMENT

 18.1 The parties hereto and the employees of the City are governed by the provisions of applicable Federal Law, State Law, and the City Charter. When any provisions thereof are in conflict with the provisions of this Agreement, the provisions of said Federal Law, State Law, or City Charter are paramount and shall prevail.

 18.2 The parties hereto and the employees of the City are governed by applicable City Ordinances and said Ordinances are paramount except where they conflict with the express provisions of this Agreement.

 ARTICLE 19 - ENTIRE AGREEMENT

 19.1 The Agreement expressed herein in writing constitutes the entire Agreement between the parties, and no oral statement shall add to or supersede any of its provisions.

 19.2 The parties acknowledge that each has had the unlimited right and opportunity to make demands and proposals with respect to any matter deemed a proper subject for collective bargaining. The results of the exercise of that right are set forth in this Agreement. Therefore, except as otherwise provided in this Agreement, each voluntarily and unqualifiedly agrees to waive the right to oblige the other party to bargain with respect to any subject or matter whether or not specifically referred to or covered in this Agreement.

 ARTICLE 20 - GRIEVANCE PROCEDURE

 20.1 Any dispute between the City and the Union concerning the interpretation, application, claim of breach or violation of the express terms of this Agreement shall be deemed a contract grievance. The following outline of grievance procedures is written for a grievance of the Union against the City, but it is understood the steps are similar for a grievance of the City against the Union.

 20.2 A contract grievance in the interest of a majority of the employees in the bargaining unit shall be reduced to writing by the Union and may be introduced at Step 3 of the contract grievance procedure and be processed within the time limits set forth herein.

 20.2.1 Grievances shall be filed at the Step in which there is authority to adjudicate such grievance within twenty (20) business days of the alleged contract violation. (Business days are defined as Monday through Friday excluding recognized City holidays [not to include personal holidays].)

 20.3 As a means of facilitating settlement of a contract grievance, either party may include an additional member at its expense on its committee. Additionally, either party may amend an initial grievance up to the second Step of the following procedure. If at any Step in the contract grievance procedure, management's answer in writing is unsatisfactory, the Union's reason for non-acceptance must be presented in writing.

 20.4 For grievances filed in accordance with Sections 20.2 and/or 20.2.1, failure by an employee or the Union to comply with any time limitation of Steps 2, 3, and 4 of the procedure in this Article shall constitute withdrawal of the grievance; provided however, any time limits stipulated in the grievance procedure may be extended for stated periods of time by the appropriate parties by mutual agreement in writing.

 20.5 Arbitration awards or grievance settlements shall not be made retroactive beyond the date of the occurrence or non-occurrence upon which the grievance is based, that date being twenty (20) business days or less prior to the initial filing of the grievance.

 20.6 A contract grievance shall be processed in accordance with the following procedure:

 20.6.1 (Step 1) - The contract grievance shall be reduced to written form by the aggrieved employee and/or the Union, stating the section of the agreement allegedly violated and explaining the grievance in detail. The aggrieved employee and/or the Union Representative shall present the written grievance to the employee's supervisor within twenty (20) business days of the alleged contract violation, with a copy of the grievance submitted to the Union by the aggrieved employee. The immediate supervisor should consult and/or arrange a meeting with his/her supervisor, if necessary to resolve the contract grievance. The parties shall make every effort to settle the contract grievance at this stage promptly. The immediate supervisor shall, in writing, answer the grievance within ten (10) business days after being notified of the grievance, with a copy of the response submitted to the aggrieved employee and the Union.

 20.6.2 (Step 2) - If the contract grievance is not resolved as provided in Step 1, or if the contract grievance is initially submitted at Step 2, it shall be reduced to written form, which shall include identification of the Section(s) of the Agreement allegedly violated, the nature of the alleged violation, and the remedy sought. The Union representative shall forward the written contract grievance to the Division Head with a copy to the City Director of Labor Relations within ten (10) business days after the Step 1 answer.

 With Mediation

 At the time the Union submits the grievance to the division head, the Union Representative or the aggrieved employee or the division head may submit a written request for voluntary mediation assistance, with a copy to the Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) Coordinator, the City Director of Labor Relations, and the Union representative. If the ADR Coordinator determines that the case is in line with the protocols and procedures of the ADR process, within ten (10) business days from receipt of the request for voluntary mediation assistance, the ADR Coordinator or his/her designee will schedule a mediation conference and make the necessary arrangements for the selection of a mediator(s). The mediator(s) will serve as an impartial third party who will encourage and facilitate a resolution to the dispute. The mediation conference(s) will be confidential and will include the parties. The Union representative and a Labor Negotiator from City Labor Relations may attend the mediation conference(s). Other persons may attend with the permission of the mediator(s) and both parties. If the parties agree to settle the matter, the mediator(s) will assist in drafting a settlement agreement, which the parties shall sign. An executed copy of the settlement agreement shall be provided to the parties, with either a copy or a signed statement of the disposition of the grievance submitted to the City Director of Labor Relations and the Union. The relevant terms of the settlement agreement shall be provided by the parties to the department's designated officials who need to assist in the implementing the agreement. If the grievance is not settled within ten (10) business days of the initial mediation conference date, the City Director of Labor Relations, the appropriate division head, and the appropriate Union representative shall be so informed by the ADR Coordinator.

 The parties to a mediation shall have no power through a settlement agreement to add to, subtract from, alter, change, or modify the terms of the collective bargaining agreement or to create a precedent regarding the interpretation of the collective bargaining agreement or to apply the settlement agreement to any circumstance beyond the explicit dispute applicable to said settlement agreement.

 If the grievance is not resolved through mediation, the Division Head shall thereafter convene a meeting within ten (10) business days between the Union representative and aggrieved employee, together with the designated Supervisor, the Section Manager, the Department Labor Relations Officer and any other members of management whose presence is deemed necessary by the City to a fair consideration of the alleged contract grievance. The City Director of Labor Relations or his/her designee may attend such meeting. The Division head shall give a written answer to the Union within ten (10) business days after the contract grievance meeting.

 20.6.3 (Step 3) - If the contract grievance is not resolved as provided in Step 2, the written contract grievance defined in the same manner as provided in Step 2 shall be forwarded within ten (10) business days after the Step 2 answer or if the contract grievance is initially submitted at Step 3, within twenty (20) business days, pursuant to Section 20.2.1 to the City Director of Labor Relations with a copy to the appropriate Department Head. The Director of Labor Relations or his/her designee shall investigate the alleged contract grievance and, if deemed appropriate, he/she shall convene a meeting between the appropriate parties. He/she shall thereafter make a confidential recommendation to the affected Department Head who shall, in turn, give the Union an answer in writing ten (10) business days after receipt of the contract grievance or the meeting between the parties.

 Mediation can be requested at Step 3 in the same manner as outlined in Step 2. The grievance must be filed in the time frame specified in Step 3 and responded to in the frame specified in Step 3 after receipt of notification from the ADR Coordinator that the grievance was not resolved through mediation.

 20.6.4 (Step 4) - If the contract grievance is not settled in Step 3, either of the signatory parties to this Agreement may submit the grievance to binding arbitration. It may be referred to the Federal Mediation and Conciliation Service for arbitration to be conducted under its voluntary labor arbitration regulations. Such reference to arbitration shall be made within twenty (20) business days after the City's answer or failure to answer in Step 3, and shall be accompanied by the following information:

 - Identification of Section(s) of Agreement allegedly violated.

 - Nature of the alleged violation.

 - Question(s) which the arbitrator is being asked to decide.

 - Remedy sought.

 In lieu of the procedure set forth in Section 20.6.4, Step 4, the City and the Union may mutually agree to select an arbitrator to decide the issue.

 Mediation can be requested at Step 4 in the same manner as outlined in Step 2. The grievance must be submitted to binding arbitration within the time frame specified in Step 4 and processed within the time frame specified in Step 4 after receipt of notification from the ADR Coordinator that the grievance was not resolved in mediation.

 20.6.5 A reclassification grievance will be initially submitted by the Union, in writing, to the Director of Labor Relations, with a copy to the Department. The Union will identify in the grievance letter the name(s) of the grievant(s), their current job classification, and the proposed job classification. The Union will include with the grievance letter a Position Description Questionnaire (PDQ) completed and signed by the grievant(s). At the time of the initial filing, if the PDQ is not submitted, the Union will have sixty (60) business days to submit the PDQ to Labor

 Relations. After initial submittal of the grievance, the procedure will be as follows:

 1. The Director of Labor Relations, or designee, will notify the Union of such receipt and will provide a date [not to exceed six (6) months from the date of receipt of the grievance] when a proposed classification determination report responding to the grievance will be sent to the Union. The Director of Labor Relations, or designee, will provide notice to the Union when, due to unforeseen delays, the time for the classification review will exceed the six (6) month period.

 2. The Department Director, upon receipt of the proposed classification determination report from the Director of Labor Relations, or designee, will respond to the grievance in writing.

 3. If the grievance is not resolved, the Union may, within twenty (20) business days of the date the grievance response is received, submit to the Director of Labor Relations a letter designating one of the following processes for final resolution:

 A. The Union may submit the grievance to binding arbitration per Article 20, Section 20.6.4; or

 B. The Union may request the classification determination be reviewed by the Classification Appeals Board, consisting of two members of the Classification/Compensation Unit and one Human Resource professional from an unaffected department. The Classification Appeals Board will, whenever possible, within ten (10) business days of receipt of the request, arrange a hearing; and, when possible, convene the hearing within thirty (30) business days. The Board will make a recommendation to the Personnel Director with forty-five (45) business days of the appeal hearing. The Director of Labor Relations, or designee, will respond to the Union after receipt of the Personnel Director's determination. If the Personnel Director affirms the Classification Board's recommendation, that decision shall be final and binding and not subject to further appeal. If the Personnel Director does not affirm the Classification Appeals Board recommendation within fifteen (15) business days, the Union may submit the grievance to arbitration per Article 20, Section 20.6.4.

 20.7 The parties shall abide by the award made in connection with any arbitrable difference. There shall be no suspension of work, slowdown, or curtailment of services while any difference is in process of adjustment or arbitration.

 20.8 In connection with any arbitration proceeding held pursuant to this Agreement, it is understood that:

 20.8.1 The arbitrator shall have no power to render a decision that will add to, subtract from or alter, change or modify the terms of this Agreement, and his power shall be limited to interpretation or application of the express terms of this Agreement, and all other matters shall be excluded from arbitration.

 20.8.2 The decision of the arbitrator regarding any arbitrable difference shall be final, conclusive and binding upon the City, the Union and the employees involved.

 20.8.3 The cost of the arbitrator shall be borne equally by the City and the Union and each party shall bear the cost of presenting its own case.

 20.8.4 The arbitrator's decision shall be made in writing and shall be issued to the parties within thirty (30) days after the case is submitted to the arbitrator.

 20.9 In no event shall this Agreement alter or interfere with disciplinary procedures followed by the City or provided for by City Charter, Ordinance or Law; provided however, disciplinary action may be processed through the contract grievance procedure; provided further, an employee covered by this Agreement must upon initiating objections relating to disciplinary action use either the contract grievance procedure contained herein (with the Union processing the grievance) or pertinent Civil Service procedures regarding disciplinary appeals. Should the employee attempt to adjudicate his/her objections relating to a disciplinary action through both the grievance procedure and the Civil Service Commission, the grievance shall be considered withdrawn upon first notice that an appeal has been filed before the Civil Service Commission. In grievances relating to discharge, the City shall present its position first before an arbitrator or the Civil Service Commission.

 20.10 The parties have agreed, through a Memorandum of Agreement, to adopt the following two procedures attached thereto that were developed by the Citywide Labor-Management Committee on Progressive Discipline:

 (1) Either party may request that grievances submitted to arbitration be subjected to a confidential Peer Review by a committee of peers from management or labor, respectively, in which case the time lines of the grievance procedure will be held in abeyance pending the completion of the Peer Review process; and

 (2) Either party may make an "Offer of Settlement" to encourage settlement of a grievance in advance of a scheduled arbitration hearing, with the potential consequence that the party refusing to accept an offer of settlement may be required to bear all of the costs of arbitration, excluding attorney and witness fees, contrary to Section 20.8.3.

 The parties may mutually agree to alter, amend or eliminate these procedures by executing a revised Memorandum of Agreement.

 ARTICLE 21 - SAVINGS CLAUSE

 21.1 If an Article of this Agreement or any Addenda thereto should be held invalid by operation of law or by any tribunal of competent jurisdiction, or if compliance with or enforcement of any Article should be restrained by such tribunal, the remainder of this Agreement and Addenda shall not be affected hereby, and the parties shall enter into immediate collective bargaining negotiations for the purpose of arriving at a mutually satisfactory replacement for such Article.

 ARTICLE 22- DISCIPLINARY ACTIONS

 22.1 The parties agree that in their respective roles primary emphasis shall be placed on preventing situations requiring disciplinary actions through effective employee-management relations. The primary objective of discipline shall be to correct and rehabilitate, not to punish or penalize. To this end, in order of increasing severity, the disciplinary actions that the City may take against an employee include:

 A. verbal warning;

 B. written reprimand;

 C. suspensions;

 D. demotion; or

 E. termination.

 Which disciplinary action is taken depends upon the seriousness of the affected employee's conduct.

 22.2 In cases of suspension or discharge, the specified charges and duration, where applicable, of the action shall be furnished to the employee in writing not later than one (1) working day after the action became or becomes effective. An employee may be suspended for just cause pending demotion or discharge action.

 22.3 Effective upon signature of this Agreement, whenever an employee is given written notice of a disciplinary action as defined above in Section 22.1, a copy of the disciplinary notice shall be transmitted to the Union. Provided, that the Department shall first ask the affected employee's permission, and in the event the employee declines, then a copy will not be sent to the Union.

 ARTICLE 23 - TERM OF AGREEMENT

 23.1 All terms and provisions of this Agreement shall become effective upon signature of both parties unless otherwise specified elsewhere, and shall remain in full force and effect through December 31, 2010. Written notice of intent to terminate or modify this Agreement must be served by the requesting party at least ninety (90) but not more than one hundred twenty (120) days prior to December 31, 2010. Any modifications requested by either party must be submitted to the other party no later than sixty (60) days prior to the expiration date of this Agreement and any modifications requested at a later date shall not be subject to negotiations unless mutually agreed upon by both parties.

 23.1.1 Notwithstanding the provisions of Section 23.1, in the event negotiations for a new Agreement extend beyond the anniversary date of this Agreement, all of the terms and provisions of this Agreement shall continue to remain in full force and effect during the course of collective bargaining, until such time as the terms of a new Agreement have been consummated, or unless either party serves the other party with ten (10) days' written notice of intent to terminate the existing Agreement.
