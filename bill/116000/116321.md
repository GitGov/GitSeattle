 WHEREAS, the City has provided for public participation in the development and review of these proposed amendments; and

 WHEREAS, the Council has reviewed and considered the Executive's report and recommendations, public testimony made at the public hearing, and other pertinent material regarding the proposed amendments; and

 WHEREAS, the Council finds that the amendments to be adopted are consistent with the Growth Management Act, and will protect and promote the health, safety, and welfare of the general public; NOW, THEREFORE,

 BE IT ORDAINED BY THE CITY OF SEATTLE AS FOLLOWS:

 Section 1. The Seattle Comprehensive Plan, as last amended by Ordinance 122600, is amended as follows:

 A. Add to Neighborhood Planning Downtown Transportation Policy 5 as follows:

 7. ~~First Hill/Capitol Hill~~Linkages across I-5. Look for opportunities to re-establish connections between Downtown and ~~First Hill/Capitol Hill~~adjacent areas by enlarging existing crossings, creating crossings under, or constructing lids over I-5 that can also provide opportunities for development or open space.

 B. Add new transportation policy T30.5 as follows:

 Look for opportunities to re-establish connections across I-5 by enlarging existing crossings, creating crossing under, or constructing lids over I-5 that can also provide opportunities for development or open space.

 C. Amend the Future Land Use Map to designate the land shown in Attachment A as a Commercial Mixed Use Area.

 D. Amend Neighborhood Planning Downtown Land Use Policy 11 as follows:

 Provide incentives to maintain variations in building scale, create public open space, and preserve buildings and uses that are scarce public benefit resources through allowing ~~a~~ transfer of development rights~~(TDR) program~~. Consistent with priorities for use of development incentives, limit the sites that may transfer development rights. Among sites eligible to transfer development rights, consider including:

 1. housing with a minimum amount of residential floor area occupied by units affordable to households with incomes at or below 50 percent of median income;

 2. Seattle landmarks in downtown areas not subject to special review district or historical district provisions;

3. Seattle landmarks and other historic properties within the Pioneer Square Preservation District and the International Special Review District;

~~3~~4. publicly available open space meeting minimum size and other standards; and

~~4~~5. sites on the same block as the receiving site in high density areas where it is desirable to retain varied building scale.

 Limitations on Sending and Receiving Site Locations. Limit sending and receiving sites so as to promote development that is consistent with the development objectives of different land use districts and to promote other goals and policies of this Plan. The proportion of floor area that may be gained through TDRs from particular sources may be limited. Limit sites eligible~~ility~~ to transfer TDRs to ~~sites~~those that provide limited downtown resources of public benefit, such as low-income housing, designated landmark structures or historic structures in historic districts, and open space, except where TDRs are allowed to be sent to nearby lots in areas where a variable scale of development is desired.

 E. Amend Neighborhood Planning Downtown Urban Design Policy 3 as follows:

 Provide the following development incentives to increase the attractiveness of preserving landmark structures and encourage adaptive reuse of historic resources: Seattle Landmarks Transfer of Development Rights. Allow the transfer of ~~unused~~ development rights from designated Seattle Landmarks located in downtown areas ~~not subject to special review district or historical district provisions,~~ where these resources are most threatened by development pressure. Subject transfers from designated Seattle Landmarks to limits, including limits on sending and receiving sites implementing Policy LU 11: Transfer of Development Rights, and to other appropriate conditions to promote the rehabilitation and public enjoyment of designated landmark features.

 Incentives. Provisions for allowing floor area above the base should not create incentives for the demolition of designated landmark structures.

 Floor Area Allowance. Within downtown mixed-use residential zones where the floor area of existing structures may exceed the density limits for non-residential use, provide an economic incentive for the use and rehabilitation of designated Seattle Landmarks by allowing the total existing floor area of a landmark structure committed to long term preservation to be occupied by permitted non-residential uses, regardless of FAR limits and without use of bonuses or TDR. Allow this incentive under the conditions that there is no reduction in the amount of floor area occupied by residential use prior to rehabilitation or any increase in the floor area in nonresidential use beyond the total floor area of the structure prior to rehabilitation. Consider limiting this incentive to lots not benefiting from other incentives, such as TDR transfers.

 F. Amend Neighborhood Planning Downtown Land Use Policy 9 as follows:

 Allow additional floor area above the base densities, and consider allowing greater height where appropriate, up to maximum limits, in specified downtown areas where it is desirable to accommodate growth, through bonuses and transfer of development rights. In determining conditions for bonus floor area, consider measures to mitigate impacts of higher density development on the downtown environment, including such resources as affordable housing, public open space, child care, human services, and pedestrian circulation.

 Allow transfer of ~~unused commercial~~ development potential from one site to another in certain circumstances, consistent with policy LU 11. When transferable, development potential is referred to for convenience as "transferable development rights," or "TDRs," but such terms do not mean that there is any legal right vested in the owner of TDRs to use or transfer them. The conditions and limitations on the transfer or use of TDRs may be modified from time to time as the City may find appropriate to implement the policies of the Comprehensive Plan in light of experience and changing conditions.

 G. Amend the Future Land Use Map to designate the portion of the South Lake Union Urban Center shown in Attachment B as a Commercial Mixed Use Area.

 H. Add new Transportation Policy T24.5 as follows:

 Work with transit providers to locate transit stops and stations to facilitate pedestrian access. Seek to develop safe street crossings at transit stop locations, particularly on roadways with more than one travel lane in any direction.

 I. Amend Transportation Policy 17 as follows:

 Provide, support, and promote programs and strategies aimed at reducing the number of car trips and miles driven (for work and non- work purposes) to increase the efficiency of the transportation system, and reduce greenhouse gas emissions.

 J. Add new Urban Village Policy 2.5 as follows:

 In areas surrounding major transit hubs, except in industrial zones, allow densities sufficient to take advantage of significant investment in public transportation infrastructure. Use incentive zoning programs and other strategies to help ensure the provision of affordable housing.

 K. Add new Urban Village Policy 7.5 as follows:

 Coordinate public and private activities to address transportation, utilities, open space and other public services to accommodate the new growth associated with subarea rezones (e.g., in transit station areas) that result in significant increases in density.

 L. Add new Housing Goal 11.5 as follows:

 Implement strategies and programs to help ensure a range of housing opportunities affordable to those who work in Seattle.

 M. Amend Land Use Policy 5.2 as follows:

 Seek opportunities in rezones or changes in development regulations to incorporate incentive programs for development of housing that is affordable for the longest term ~~practicable~~practical.

 N. Amend Urban Village Policy 57 as follows:

 Promote inter-agency and intergovernmental cooperation to expand community gardening opportunities~~, and include P-Patch community gardening among priorities for use of City surplus property~~.

 O. Add new Urban Village Policy 57.5 as follows:

 Create opportunities for people to experience the natural environment by including parks, forested areas, community gardens (P-Patches), and viewpoints among the priority uses to be considered for the City's surplus properties.

 P. Amend discussion in the Environment Element under Part E, as follows:

 Part E. Climate Change

 Climate change and the human factors that contribute to it are not confined to jurisdictional boundaries. Nevertheless, Seattle City government can contribute to reductions of those factors through public education, regulation, and by reducing emissions from City government operations.

 Seattle is a regional employment center and, as such, is a locus for the generation of greenhouse gas emissions from industry and traffic that are the shared responsibility of the region, state, and nation. By monitoring and seeking to respond to emissions within Seattle's geographic boundaries, Seattle can contribute to regional reduction in greenhouse gases.

 This Comprehensive Plan addresses the period between 2004 and 2024. The greenhouse gas emission goals below are set to correspond to a 50- year goal consistent with studies prepared by national and international organizations. These studies indicate that developed countries must reduce greenhouse gases as much as 80 percent in carbon dioxide equivalents (CO2e) below 1990 levels by 2050 in order to achieve climate stabilization.

 Meeting targets for reductions in greenhouse gas emissions will require political consensus and technology innovation. Without such consensus and innovation, there is a risk that the City may not continue to make necessary progress in meeting these goals. Seattle can, and should, be in the forefront of developing new economic opportunities in industrial sectors that can positively affect greenhouse gas reduction.

In addition to doing its part to reduce the effects of climate change, the City must also prepare for, and adapt to, the effects of climate change.

 Q. Add new Environment Goal 7.5 as follows:

 Be prepared for the likely effects of climate change.

 R. Add new Environment Policy 15.5 as follows:

 For itself and the general public, the City should anticipate the effects of climate change and make plans for adapting to those effects.

 S. Add new Transportation Policy T35.5 as follows:

 Provide facilities for non-motorized modes of travel that keep pace with development in the City.

 T. Add new part and discussion section to the Environment Element as follows:

Part H. Seattle's Trees  Discussion

 The existence of tree canopy and significant trees in the city are important to retaining the livability of the City as growth occurs. The significance of trees is reflected not only in the policies in this Environment Element, but also in the significant number of policies distributed throughout this plan. The reader may want to see the following related policies: UVG40, LU39, LU40, LU41, LU53.1, LU151, LU165, T13, U10, A-P33, BL-P13, BL-P18, BL-P27, CH/B-P15, ID-P13, GL-P31, G/PR-G3 A, G/PR-P21, G/PR-P33, QA-P1, R-EP1, R-EP4, SLU-P46, CR6, Also see the discussion in the Transportation Element, in section E, "Improving the Environment."

 U. Relocate policies E.4, E.9, E.9.5 and E.10.1 to the new Part H described in subsection T above, as follows:

~~E4: Strive to protect and retain certain trees and groups of trees that enhance Seattle's historical, cultural, environmental and aesthetic character.~~

~~E9: Work to achieve a sustainable urban forest that contains a diverse mix of tree species and ages in order to use the forest's abilities to reduce storm water runoff and pollution, absorb air pollutants, provide wildlife habitat, absorb carbon dioxide, provide shade, stabilize soil, and increase property values.~~

~~E9.5: Strive to achieve no net loss of tree canopy coverage starting in 2008, and strive to increase tree canopy coverage by 1 percent per year up to a total of 40 percent, to reduce storm runoff, absorb air pollutants, reduce noise, stabilize soil, provide habitat, and mitigate the heat island effect of developed areas.~~

~~E10.1: Update the 2000 tree canopy inventory in the Urban Forest Management Plan every 10 years to measure progress toward the goal of increased canopy coverage.~~

Policies  E21: Strive to protect and retain certain trees and groups of trees that enhance Seattle's historical, cultural, environmental and aesthetic character.

 E22: Work to achieve a sustainable urban forest that contains a diverse mix of tree species and ages in order to use the forest's abilities to reduce storm water runoff and pollution, absorb air pollutants, provide wildlife habitat, absorb carbon dioxide, provide shade, stabilize soil, and increase property values.

 E23: Strive to achieve no net loss of tree canopy coverage starting in 2008, and strive to increase tree canopy coverage by 1 percent per year up to a total of 40 percent, to reduce storm runoff, absorb air pollutants, reduce noise, stabilize soil, provide habitat, and mitigate the heat island effect of developed areas.
