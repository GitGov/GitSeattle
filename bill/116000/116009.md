 ORDINANCE _________________

 AN ORDINANCE related to land use and zoning; amending Sections 23.49.011, 23.49.013, and 23.49.035 of the Seattle Municipal Code, revising regulations for Downtown Seattle; amending provisions for allowing chargeable floor area to exceed the base floor area ratio; adding floor area exemptions; providing incentives for maintaining designated Landmark structures and existing small scale structures on a development lot; amending regulations regarding development standards for lots where such incentives are used; and making technical corrections.

 WHEREAS, designated Landmark structures and small structures that add interest and diversity to the scale of Downtown development are recognized as providing a significant public benefit, and Seattle's Comprehensive Plan includes goals and policies to protect them, including CR11 in the Cultural Resources Element and DT-G4, DT-UDP1, DT-LUP11, COM-P1, COM-P2, and COM-P3 in the Neighborhood Planning Element; and

 WHEREAS, Ordinance 122054 enacted density increases for several Downtown zones, which could increase redevelopment pressure for lots occupied by Landmark structures and smaller structures, making it increasingly important to provide incentives to retain such structures as redevelopment occurs; and

 WHEREAS, the City has conducted analysis of locations with potential for redevelopment that could have an impact on Landmark structures and small structures, and determined that the need and potential use of such incentives to retain these structures as proposed is greatest in the Downtown Office Core 1 (DOC1) zone; NOW, THEREFORE,

 BE IT ORDAINED BY THE CITY OF SEATTLE AS FOLLOWS:

 Section 1. Section 23.49.011 of the Seattle Municipal Code, which Section was last amended by Ordinance 122054, is amended as follows:

 23.49.011 Floor area ratio.

 A. General Standards.

 1. The base and maximum floor area ratio (FAR) for each zone is provided in Chart 23.49.011 A1.

 N.A. = Not Applicable.

 2. Chargeable floor area shall not exceed the applicable base FAR except as expressly authorized pursuant to the provisions of this chapter.

 a. For new structures in DOC1, DOC2 and DMC zones allowing chargeable floor area above the base FAR, the first increment of chargeable floor area above the base FAR, shown for each zone on Chart 23.49.011 A.2, shall be gained by making a commitment satisfactory to the Director that the proposed development will earn a LEED Silver rating or ~~a~~ meet a substantially equivalent standard approved by the Director as a Type I decision. In these zones, no chargeable floor area above the base FAR is allowed for a project that includes chargeable floor area in a new structure unless the applicant makes such a commitment. When such a commitment is made, the provisions of SMC Section 23.49.020 shall apply. The Director may establish by rule procedures for determining whether an applicant has demonstrated that a new structure has earned a LEED Silver rating or met any such substantially equivalent standard, provided that no rule shall assign authority for making a final determination to any person other than an officer of the Department of Planning and Development or another City agency with regulatory authority and expertise in green building practices. This subsection A2a shall expire on May 12, 2011.

 Seattle Municipal Code Chart 23.49.011 A2

 ZONE First increment of FAR above the base FAR achieved through LEED Silver Rating DOC1 1.0 DOC2 0.75 DMC 340/290-400 0.50 DMC 125, 160, 240/290-400 0.25

 b. In DOC1, DOC2, and DMC zones, additional chargeable floor area above the first increment of FAR that exceeds the base FAR may be obtained only by qualifying for floor area bonuses pursuant to Section 23.49.012 or 23.49.013, or by the transfer of development rights pursuant to Section 23.49.014, or both, except as provided in subsections A2c through A2i, A2k and A2l of this section. After the expiration of subsection A2a of this section, the first increment of floor area above the base FAR  shall be zero (0).

 c. In the DOC1 zone, additional chargeable floor area over seventeen (17) FAR may be obtained only through the transfer of rural development credits, except as provided below in this subsection A2c. No chargeable floor area shall be allowed under this subsection A2c unless, at the time of the Master Use Permit application for the project proposing such floor area, an agreement is in effect between the City and King County, duly authorized by City ordinance, for the implementation of a Rural Development Credits Program. If no such agreement is in effect, the chargeable floor area above the seventeenth FAR may be obtained according to the provisions of Section 23.49.011A2f.

 d. In no event shall the use of bonuses, TDR, or rural development credits, or any combination of them, be allowed to result in chargeable floor area in excess of the maximum as set forth in Chart 23.49.011 A.1, except that a structure on a lot in a planned community development pursuant to Section 23.49.036 or a combined lot development pursuant to Section 23.49.041, may exceed the floor area ratio otherwise permitted on that lot, provided the chargeable floor area on all lots included in the planned community development or combined lot development as a whole does not exceed the combined total permitted chargeable floor area.

 e. Except as otherwise provided in this subsection A2e or subsections A2g or A2i of this section, not less than five (5) percent of all floor area above the base FAR to be gained on any lot, excluding any floor area gained under subsections A2a, A2k, and A2l of this ~~S~~section, shall be gained through the transfer of Landmark TDR, to the extent that Landmark TDR is available. Landmark TDR shall be considered "available" only to the extent that, at the time of the Master Use Permit application to gain the additional floor area, the City of Seattle is offering Landmark TDR for sale, at a price per square foot no greater than the total bonus contribution under Section 23.49.012 for a project using the cash option for both housing and childcare facilities. An applicant may satisfy the minimum Landmark TDR requirement in this section by purchases from private parties, by transfer from an eligible sending lot owned by the applicant, by purchase from the City, or by any combination of the foregoing. This subsection A2e does not apply to any lot in a DMR zone.

 f. Except as otherwise permitted under subsection A2h or A2i of this section, on any lot except a lot in a DMR zone, the total amount of chargeable floor area gained through bonuses under Section 23.49.012, together with any housing TDR and Landmark housing TDR used for the same project, shall equal seventy-five (75) percent of the amount, if any, by which the total chargeable floor area to be permitted on the lot exceeds the sum of

 (i) the base FAR, as determined under this section and Section 23.49.032 if applicable, plus (ii) any chargeable floor area gained on the lot pursuant to subsections A2a, A2c, A2h, ~~or~~A2i, A2k, and A2l of this section. At least half of the remaining twenty-five (25) percent shall be gained by using TDR from a sending lot with a major performing arts facility, to the extent available. The balance of such twenty-five (25) percent shall be gained through bonuses under Section 23.49.013 or through TDR other than housing TDR, or both, consistent with this chapter. TDR from a sending lot with a major performing arts facility shall be considered "available" only to the extent that, at the time of the Master Use Permit application to gain the additional floor area, the City of Seattle is offering such TDR for sale, at a price per square foot not exceeding the prevailing market price for TDR other than housing TDR, as determined by the Director.

 g. In order to gain chargeable floor area on any lot in a DMR zone, an applicant may (i) use any types of TDR eligible under this chapter in any proportions, or (ii) use bonuses under Section 23.49.012 or 23.49.013, or both, subject to the limits for particular types of bonus under Section 23.49.013, or (iii) combine such TDR and bonuses in any proportions.

 h. On any lot in a DMC zone allowing a maximum FAR of seven (7), in addition to the provisions of subsection A2f above, an applicant may gain chargeable floor area above the first increment of FAR above the base FAR through use of DMC housing TDR, or any combination of DMC housing TDR with floor area gained through other TDR and bonuses as prescribed in subsection A2f.

 i. When the amount of bonus development sought in any permit application does not exceed five thousand (5,000) square feet of chargeable floor area, the Director may permit such floor area to be achieved solely through the bonus for housing and child care.

~~j. Subsection A2a of this section shall expire~~~~five (5) years from the effective date of Ordinance 122054, and thereafter that first increment of floor area above the base FAR shall be zero (0).~~~~~~j.~~k.~~ No chargeable floor area above the base FAR shall be granted to any proposed development that would result in significant alteration to any designated feature of a Landmark structure, unless a Certificate of Approval for the alteration is granted by the Landmarks Preservation Board.

k. On a lot entirely in a DOC1 zone, additional chargeable floor area equal to 1.0 FAR may be permitted above the increment achieved through a commitment as prescribed in subsection 23.49.011A2a, or above the base FAR after expiration of that subsection, on a lot that includes one or more qualifying Landmarks, subject to the following conditions:

(1) the structure is rehabilitated to the extent necessary so that all features and characteristics controlled or designated by ordinance pursuant to SMC Chapter 25.12 or Ordinance 102229 are in good condition and consistent with the applicable ordinances and with any certificates of approval issued by the Landmarks Preservation Board, all as determined by the Director of Neighborhoods; and

(2) a notice shall be recorded in the King County real estate records, in form satisfactory to the Director, regarding the bonus allowed and the effect thereof under the terms of this chapter.  For purposes of this section, a "qualifying Landmark" is a structure that (i) has a gross floor area above grade of at least five thousand (5,000) square feet; (ii) is separate from the principal structure or structures existing or to be developed on the lot, except that it may abut and connect with one such structure along one exterior wall; (iii) is subject, in whole or in part, to a designating ordinance pursuant to SMC Chapter 25.12, or was designated pursuant to Ordinance 102229; and (iv) is on a lot on which no improvement, object, feature or characteristic has been altered or removed contrary to any provision of Chapter 25.12 or any designating ordinance. A qualifying Landmark for which a bonus is allowed under this subsection shall be considered a public benefit feature, but shall not be considered an amenity for purposes of Section 23.49.013. For so long as any of the chargeable floor area allowed under this subsection A2k remains on the lot, each qualifying Landmark for which such bonus was granted shall remain designated as a Landmark under Chapter 25.12 and the owner shall maintain the exterior and interior of each qualifying Landmark in good condition and repair and in a manner that preserves the features and characteristics that are subject to designation or controls by ordinance, and that maintains compliance with all applicable requirements of federal, state and local laws, ordinances, regulations, and restrictions.

 l. On a lot entirely in a DOC1 zone, as an incentive to maintain diversity in the scale of downtown development, additional floor area equal to 0.5 FAR may be granted above the increment achieved through a commitment as prescribed in subsection 23.49.011A2a, or above the base FAR after expiration of that subsection, on a lot that includes one or more qualifying small structures, subject to the conditions in this subsection A2l.

(1) A "qualifying small structure" is one that satisfies all of the following standards:

(iv) the structure is not occupied by parking above the ground floor.

(2) If the structure is removed from the lot or ceases to be a qualifying small structure, then any development on the portion of the lot previously occupied by the structure, defined by a rectangle enclosing the exterior walls of the structure as they exist at the time the bonus is granted and extended to the nearest street frontage, shall be limited to a maximum floor area of fifty thousand (50,000) square feet for all uses and a maximum height of one hundred and twenty-five (125) feet, excluding any rooftop features as specified in subsection 23.49.008.d.

(3) A notice shall be recorded in the King County real estate records, in form satisfactory to the Director, regarding the bonus allowed and the effect thereof under the terms of this chapter.

(4) Bonus floor area under this subsection A2l may not be granted on the basis of a Landmark structure for which bonus floor area is allowed under subsection A2k of this section, but may be allowed on the basis of a different structure or structures that are on the same lot as a Landmark structure for which such bonus floor area is allowed.

3. The Master Use Permit application to establish any bonus development under this section shall include a calculation of the amount of bonus development sought and shall identify the manner in which the conditions to such bonus development shall be satisfied. The Director shall, at the time of issuance of any Master Use Permit decision approving any such bonus development, issue a Type I decision as to the amount of bonus development to be allowed and the conditions to such bonus development, which decision may include alternative means to achieve bonus development, at the applicant's option, if each alternative would be consistent with the  provisions of this section and~~conditions of~~ any other conditions of the permit, including Design Review if applicable.

c. The Director may allow departures from the eligibility conditions in the Downtown Amenity Standards as a Type I decision, to allow floor area in a Landmark structure satisfying the standards of Section 23.49.011A2k or in a small structure satisfying the standards of Section 23.49.011A2l to qualify as floor area eligible for a bonus when adapted to serve as a hillclimb assist, museum, shopping corridor, or public atrium amenity.

 B. Unless the specified period for which a feature is to be maintained has expired in accordance with the terms of this chapter, or another provision of this chapter specifically otherwise provides, a public benefit feature may be diminished or discontinued only if:

 1. the feature is not housing or child care; and

 2. a. the additional gross floor area permitted in return for the specific feature is ~~permanently~~ removed or converted to a use that is not counted as chargeable floor area; or

 b. an amount of chargeable floor area equal to that obtained by the public benefit feature to be replaced is provided pursuant to provisions for granting floor area above the base FAR in this chapter.

 C. The terms under which use as a ~~l~~Landmark performing arts theater maybe discontinued or diminished, and the sanctions for failure to continue such use, shall be governed by the agreements and instruments executed by the City and owners of the properties on which such theaters are located. Any such change in use shall not affect any other structure for which additional FAR was granted in return for the provision of such public benefit features.

 D. In addition to the provisions of subsections A and B, this subsection applies in Downtown zones when additional gross floor area or a floor area exemption is granted for any of the following public benefit features: Human service uses, child care centers, retail shopping, cinemas, performing arts theaters other than landmark performing arts theaters, major retail stores, and museums.

 1. In the event that the occupant or operator of one (1) of the public benefit features listed in this subsection moves out of a structure, or notifies the owner of intent to move, the owner or owner's agent shall notify the Director within five (5) days of the date that notice of intent to move is given or that the occupant or operator moves out, whichever is earlier.

 2. Starting from the fifth day after notice is given or that the occupant or operator moves out, whichever is first, the owner or owner's agent shall have a maximum of six (6) months to replace the use with another use that meets the provisions of Section 23.49.011 and the Downtown Amenity Standards.

 3. When the public benefit feature is replaced, any portion of the gross floor area formerly occupied by that feature and not reoccupied by a replacement feature, may be either:

 a. Changed to other uses that are exempt from FAR calculations in the zone in which the structure is located; or

 b. Changed to uses that are not exempt from FAR calculations, provided that this would not cause the structure to exceed the maximum FAR limit for the zone in which it is located, and that gross floor area in an amount equivalent to the gross floor area proposed to be changed shall be achieved through provision of public benefit features, or transfer of development rights, according to the provisions of SMC Section 23.49.011.

 4. As a condition to allowing the substitution of a feature, rather than an application to establish floor area de novo under the terms of this chapter, during the time that the space formerly constituting the amenity feature is vacant, it shall be made available to nonprofit community and charitable organizations for events at no charge.

 E. Modifications of amenity features that do not result in the diminishment or discontinuation of the feature may be permitted by the Director as a Type I decision, provided that the Director finds that the feature as modified meets the eligibility conditions in the Downtown Amenity Standards.

F. A qualifying small structure for which a bonus is allowed pursuant to Section 23.49.011 shall be considered discontinued if it is removed or altered so that it is no longer a qualifying small structure within the meaning of that Section.

G. A qualifying Landmark for which a bonus is allowed pursuant to Section 23.49.011 shall be considered discontinued if it is demolished or removed, or it is altered so that it is no longer a qualifying Landmark within the meaning in that Section; or if any feature or characteristic that is controlled or designated by ordinance is removed or altered contrary to any provision of Chapter 25.12; or if the owner fails to maintain in good condition and repair any feature or characteristic of the structure that is designated or subject to controls under any ordinance; or if there is any revision or revocation of controls pursuant to Section 25.12.860 or successor provision.
