 ORDINANCE _________________

 WHEREAS, the current taximeter rates became effective on April 1, 2005, and since that time the Consumer Price Index has risen approximately 7% in the Seattle metropolitan area, with fuel prices increasing at an even higher rate, making it appropriate to adjust rates to reflect inflationary cost increases; NOW, THEREFORE,

 BE IT ORDAINED BY THE CITY OF SEATTLE AS FOLLOWS:

 Section 1. Effective October 1, 2008, Subsections D and E of Section 6.310.530 of the Seattle Municipal Code are amended as follows:

 * * *

 D. Except for special or contract rates as provided for in this chapter, or any per trip fee established by the Port of Seattle and set forth in any operating agreement or tariff, or an airport flat rate defined in this section, or a temporary fuel surcharge authorized by the Director pursuant to subsection I of this section, it shall be unlawful for anyone operating a taxicab licensed by The City of Seattle to advertise, charge, demand or receive any greater or lesser rate than the following:

 Meter rate:

 1. Drop charge: for passengers for first 1/10 mile.... $2.50[CoS1]

 2. Per mile: For each 1/10 mile or fraction thereof after the first 1/10 mile.... $ 0 .25

 3. For every one (1) minute of waiting time.... $.50* (charged at $0.25 per 30 seconds)

4. Additional per passenger charge for more than two (2) persons, excluding children under twelve (12) years of age.... $.50

 * Waiting time rates are charged when taxicab speed is less than twelve (12) miles per hour or when a taxicab driver is asked to wait for the customer.

 E. Special Rates, Contract Rates, "Downtown to Airport" Flat Rate, and Coupons.

 1. Special rates as defined in this chapter shall be calculated as a fraction or percentage of the meter rate.

 2. The special rates must be filed with the Director on forms furnished by the Director.

 3. All special rates and/or contract rates shall be filed once a year at the time of application by the taxicab association representative, or by the owner of a for-hire vehicle which is not a taxicab.

 4. Licensees may change the special rates filed no more than once a year.

 5. Contract rates set during the license year shall be filed within two (2) weeks of securing such contract and before implementing the contract rate.

 6. All taxicabs shall charge a flat rate of ~~Twenty-eight Dollars ($28)~~Thirty-Two Dollars ($32) from the downtown hotel district to Seattle-Tacoma International Airport except when contract rates are in effect for the trip, or when the Director has temporarily suspended the flat rate in accordance with subsection J of this section. The downtown hotel district is the area defined by Broad Street to Mercer Street to I-5 on the north, Elliot Bay on the west, South Dearborn Street on the south, and Boren Ave, to the I-5 Freeway and then the Freeway on the east.

 7. The use of coupons or discounts to establish a lower rate, or a rate not provided within this section, is prohibited (Class A - each incident).
