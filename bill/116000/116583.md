 AN ORDINANCE relating to Interlaken Park; authorizing an exchange of property to accomplish a lot boundary adjustment to correct an encroachment onto Interlaken Park; and finding that such exchange of property meets the requirements of Ordinance 118477, which adopted Initiative 42.

 WHEREAS, James and Melissa Crisera (the Criseras) purchased in 1998 the residence at 1931 Boyer Avenue East, adjacent to Interlaken Park; and

 WHEREAS, subsequent to the purchase the Criseras learned that a portion of their house extends beyond their property line into Interlaken Park and contacted the Department of Parks and Recreation with a proposal to exchange equivalent property; and

 WHEREAS, the Superintendent of Parks and Recreation issued the Criseras a Revocable Use Permit (#2006-09), which allows the Criseras to temporarily occupy park property and provides a procedure to develop a permanent solution through a lot boundary adjustment; and

 WHEREAS, pursuant to Ordinance 118477 no land held for park and recreation purposes is to be sold, transferred, or changed from park use unless there is no reasonable and practical alternative and the City of Seattle receives in exchange land of equivalent or better size, value, location, and usefulness in the vicinity, serving the same community and the same park purposes; and

 WHEREAS, equivalent property has been identified that is acceptable as replacement property for the park land to be transferred to accomplish the lot boundary adjustment; and

 WHEREAS, the parcels proposed for exchange have been appraised and determined to be of equivalent value; and

 WHEREAS, the lot boundary adjustment will reflect an exchange of similar and close to equal areas of land resulting in no reduction in size of Interlaken Park; and
