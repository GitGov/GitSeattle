 AN ORDINANCE relating to Lake Union Park amending Section 3 of Ordinance 122085.

 WHEREAS, Seattle citizens have envisioned the creation of an accessible waterfront park at the south end of Lake Union since the Olmsted Park Plan was developed more than one hundred years ago; and

 WHEREAS, the 1998 South Lake Union Neighborhood Plan emphasized the development of the South Lake Union Park as a top priority; and

 WHEREAS, Resolution 30080 authorized the property disposition process that led to the sale of City of Seattle ("City") property in Lake Union and set forth a number of policy objectives, which continue to guide the City's actions; and

 WHEREAS, the 2000 Neighborhood Parks, Green Spaces, Trails and Zoo Levy ("2000 Parks Levy") identified funding for the development of the Lake Union Park ("LU Park"); and

 WHEREAS, the voters of Seattle approved the 2000 Parks Levy on November 7, 2000; and

 WHEREAS, Ordinance 121963 authorized the execution of an Agreement (Attachment A of the Ordinance) between the Seattle Department of Parks and Recreation ("DPR") and the Seattle Parks Foundation ("Foundation"), committing the Foundation to launch a fundraising campaign to raise Ten Million Dollars ($10,000,000) to be donated to the City for design, development, and construction of LU Park; and

 WHEREAS, Exhibit A to Attachment A of Ordinance 121963 outlined a Twenty-five Million Dollar ($25,000,000) budget for the LU Park Development Project; and

 WHEREAS, Ordinance 122084 amended the Agreement authorized by Ordinance 121963 between DPR and the Foundation; and

 WHEREAS, Ordinance 122085 increased the LU Park Development Project budget by Four Million Two Hundred Twenty-eight Thousand Dollars ($4,228,000) for a total project budget of Twenty-nine Million Two Hundred Twenty-eight Thousand Dollars ($29,228,000); and

 WHEREAS, Section 3 of Ordinance 122085 stated the City Council's intent that the City would not appropriate any additional funds to the LU Park Development project if total costs exceeded the Approved Budget of Twenty-nine Million Two Hundred Twenty-seven Thousand Nine Hundred Thirty-five Dollars ($29,227,935); and

 WHEREAS, construction of LU Park is being undertaken in phases; and

 WHEREAS, construction of phases one and two of LU Park are projected to cost approximately One Million Eight Hundred Twenty-one Thousand Dollars ($1,821,000) more than the budget approved in Ordinance 122085 for phases one and two of the LU Park project; and

 WHEREAS, these cost increases are due to rapid escalation of steel and concrete costs, specifically a thirty-two percent rise in steel costs, which increased the costs for the bulkhead and pedestrian bridge, and a twenty-four percent rise in concrete costs, which also raised the costs for the pedestrian bridge; and

 WHEREAS, the general escalation rate of construction costs within the contingency was mistakenly applied only to the construction subtotal and not to the tax and design and estimating contingency, and

 WHEREAS, the Washington State sales tax costs increased because of a sales tax rate increase from 8.8% to 9%; and

 WHEREAS, DPR can cover these additional costs by transferring surplus funds from the completed Lake Union Park - Armory Assessment and Roof Repair project (K732224), completed Cal Anderson Park Development Project (K733132) and state grants; NOW, THEREFORE,

 BE IT ORDAINED BY THE CITY OF SEATTLE AS FOLLOWS:

 Section 1. Section 3 of Ordinance 122085 shall be amended as follows:

 Section 3. If the Finance Director, pursuant to the procedures in Section 2.2 of the Agreement with the Foundation authorized by Ordinance 121693 (the "Agreement"), concludes that it is more likely than not that the Foundation will not achieve its goal of raising $10 million in private funds (pledges and cash) by June 30, 2008, it is the Council's intent that the project scope for Phase 2 will be reduced and that the Council will not appropriate additional funds to fill the gap. ~~Further, except as otherwise required by the Agreement, it is the Council's intent that the City will not appropriate additional funds to the SLU Park Development Project if total costs exceed the Approved Budget of $29,227, 935, as shown in the Revised Project Budget, Exhibit 1 to the Agreement~~Further, except as otherwise required by the Agreement, it is the Council's intent that it will not make future appropriations in excess of $31,049,366 to the Department of Parks and Recreation for the Lake Union Park Development Project [K733134], as shown in Attachment A, including appropriation of any future grants. The Council also requests that the department not transfer funds that would increase expenditures for the project above $31,049,366.

 Section 2. Any act pursuant to the authority of this ordinance and prior to its effective date is hereby ratified and confirmed.

 Section 3. This ordinance shall take effect and be in force thirty (30) days from and after its approval by the Mayor, but if not approved and returned by the Mayor within ten (10) days after presentation, it shall take effect as provided by Municipal Code Section 1.04.020.

 Notes:1) The variance of $1,399,431 in Phase I is comprised of additional costs associated with an escalation of steel and concrete costs, an increase in the State sales tax and construction of two of the five planting islands originally scheduled to be constructed under Phase II. These additional costs are covered by funding transferred from the Lake Union Park Armory Assessment Project ($831,389), the Cal Anderson Park Development Project (K733132 - $300,000), and partial funding associated with two IAC grants ($268,042 from the grants). The five planting islands were originally scheduled to be installed under Phase II with two islands in an area under construction in Phase I. In order to avoid re-doing this area and to save installation costs these were installed during Phase I.2) The Phase II variance of $422,000 is based on higher than expected bids. These additional costs are covered by two IAC grants of $190,042 + $500,000.
