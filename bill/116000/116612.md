 AN ORDINANCE related to farmers markets; stating the Seattle City Council's findings regarding the economic impacts of farmers markets; adopting and authorizing the establishment of a program regarding farmers markets; amending the current Department of Parks and Recreation (Parks) fee schedule (Attachment 1 to Ordinance No. 122850) and the current Seattle Department of Transportation (SDOT) fee schedule (Exhibit A to Ordinance No. 122295) to clarify the appropriate application of certain Parks and SDOT permit fees to farmers markets participating in the program; amending SMC 11.26.260C in order to exempt farmers markets from service parking permits; amending SMC 22.602, Schedule B, Table 22.602.045B, in order to establish certain Seattle Fire Department (SFD) permit codes and fees for farmers markets participating in the program; amending SMC 3.14.620 to clarify that the Director of the Office of Economic Development (OED) has authority to adopt rules; authorizing and directing the OED to adopt rules implementing this ordinance; and ratifying and confirming certain prior acts.

 WHEREAS, farmers markets are an important contributor to Seattle's economic and cultural life; and

 WHEREAS, due to widespread redevelopment of property in Seattle's neighborhood business districts, existing farmers markets are experiencing difficulty staging markets on privately owned sites and market sponsors have asked the City to assist them in securing more stable locations on public property; and

 WHEREAS, the City owns and operates various real properties and manages public rights of way, including property under the jurisdiction of the Department of Parks and Recreation (Parks), the Seattle Department of Transportation (SDOT), and the Fleets and Facilities Department (FFD); and

 WHEREAS Parks, SDOT, the Seattle Fire Department (SFD), and the Office of Economic Development (OED) have adopted administrative rules implementing a program for farmers markets, which clarify how their respective fee schedules are applied to farmers markets participating in the program; and

 WHEREAS, several farmers markets have applied for and been granted permits to use property and or public rights of way under Parks' and SDOT's jurisdictions to stage and support those farmers markets; and

 WHEREAS, SDOT's and Parks' current fee schedules do not include specific references to particular permits for farmers markets located on City-owned property within those departments' jurisdictions; and

 WHEREAS, SFD is authorized to charge a variety of permit fees, including those authorized by SMC Section 22.602 and its attached schedules, which do not include a specific reference to particular permits for farmers markets; and

 WHEREAS, the City wishes to adopt and authorize the establishment of the program; NOW THEREFORE,

 BE IT ORDAINED BY THE CITY OF SEATTLE AS FOLLOWS:

 Section 1. The City Council makes the following legislative findings regarding the economic impacts of farmers markets on Seattle.

 1. The City has a substantial interest in identifying stable locations for farmers markets because they are extremely popular in the neighborhoods and provide valuable public benefits. The markets provide fresh regionally produced farm products directly to consumers who shop in neighborhood business districts. Other public benefits brought by these simple, popular markets include: improved access to high quality fresh fruits and vegetables; increased use of adjacent City-owned property or rights-of-way for desirable purposes such as pedestrian and recreational uses; the provision of a regular gathering place for people to interact in their neighborhood business districts; increased commerce for adjacent businesses due to greater pedestrian traffic on market days; and preservation of local farm land from redevelopment. Regional small farmers report that neighborhood farmers markets have become a vitally important source of revenue that enables them to keep their farms in production.

 2. City-owned properties or rights-of-way located in or near neighborhood business districts are often the most stable sites for farmers markets because they are not subject to redevelopment pressures. Examples of these types of properties include temporary use of Parks properties, SDOT street closures, and properties controlled by FFD and they are the most suitable publicly-owned sites upon which to locate regularly recurring farmers markets.

 3. A major barrier to using City-owned property or rights-of-way for such farmers markets has been the manner in which certain fees have been computed for regularly recurring farmers markets. Regularly recurring farmers markets use public property or rights-of-way in substantially the same manner each time, so certain fees should, as provided below, be calculated on an annual rather than a weekly or other "per use" basis.

 Section 2. The City hereby adopts and authorizes the establishment of a Farmers Market Program which was first operated as the Farmers Market Pilot Program described in Multi-Departmental Administrative Rule (MDAR) 09-01 (Attachment A). Parks, SDOT, SFD, and OED are authorized to continue implementing the farmers market program described in MDAR 09-01, including the authority to interpret and apply the applicable fee schedules and to waive or assess certain fees in the manner described in the rule. OED shall have primary responsibility for administering the program. The Director of OED is authorized and directed to adopt, and if necessary amend, additional administrative rules implementing the program. Farmers markets that wish to participate in the program shall submit applications to OED on forms developed for that purpose. OED shall process the applications, determine initial eligibility, coordinate the issuance of necessary permits, and periodically verify participating farmers markets' ongoing eligibility to participate in the program. Participating farmers markets shall promptly notify OED of any material changes in their operations that might affect their eligibility to participate in the program.

 Section 3. Parks Permits. The Parks 2009-2010 Fee Schedule, Attachment 1 to Ordinance No. 122850, is amended as follows:
