 AN ORDINANCE relating to taxation, establishing a new rate for the tax levied upon total gross income from the wastewater charges provided for under City ordinances; and amending Section 5.48.050 of the Seattle Municipal Code.

 WHEREAS, Ordinance 120531 directed Seattle Public Utilities (SPU) to enter into a contract for the installation, operation, and maintenance of five automated public toilets (APTs) in Seattle's downtown and urban centers; and

 WHEREAS, Ordinance 121673 established a new rate for the tax levied upon total gross income from the drainage and wastewater charges provided for under City ordinances, with such rate including a one-half a percent (0.5%) increase in the tax imposed on wastewater charges to provide a revenue stream sufficient to cover the costs of operating and maintaining the five automated public toilets; and

 WHEREAS, the City terminated the toilet contract on July 31, 2008; and

 WHEREAS, the Drainage and Wastewater Utility faces significant revenue losses in the declining economy, requiring major reductions to its operating and capital budgets, while at the same time coming under new state and federal regulatory mandates that require a significant new effort to inspect and maintain the drainage system and prevent combined sewer overflows; and

 WHEREAS, the Mayor and Council wish to avoid an increase in drainage and wastewater rates in 2010; and

 WHEREAS, a rollback of the tax increment formerly associated with automated public toilets would save the utility approximately $900,000 in annual tax payments, which can be applied to the provision of utility services; NOW THEREFORE

 BE IT ORDAINED BY THE CITY OF SEATTLE AS FOLLOWS:
