 AN ORDINANCE related to land use and zoning, amending Sections 23.50.027 and 23.50.028 of the Seattle Municipal Code to reduce the size limit for certain non-industrial uses in industrial zones.

 WHEREAS the City's policy, as expressed in the Comprehensive Plan, directs the City to "(p)reserve industrial land for industrial uses..."; and

 WHEREAS, the City has conducted studies indicating a continuing high demand for industrial businesses to locate in the city; and

 WHEREAS, the City's studies further indicate that development of retail and office uses in industrial zones reduces the amount of land available for industrial uses and inhibits the ability of industrial businesses to locate, remain or expand in the city; and

 WHEREAS, the City's current regulations allow new office uses of 50,000 square feet in the general industrial 1 (IG1) zone and 100,000 square feet in the general industrial 2 (IG2) zone and retail uses of 30,000 square feet and 75,000 square feet, respectively, in these zones; and

 WHEREAS, a series of reports on Seattle's Industrial Lands indicate that stricter limits on office and retail uses could better fulfill the intent of the City's adopted policy of preserving industrial land for industrial uses and discourage competition for industrial land by nonindustrial uses; NOW, THEREFORE,

 BE IT ORDAINED BY THE CITY OF SEATTLE AS FOLLOWS:
