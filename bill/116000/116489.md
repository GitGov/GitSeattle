 AN ORDINANCE related to the Seattle Youth Violence Prevention Initiative, lifting a budget proviso, amending the 2009 Adopted Budget, creating a new Youth Violence Prevention budget control level, changing appropriations to various department budgets and budget control levels, and abrogating positions in connection thereto.

 WHEREAS, while Seattle's overall crime rate has dropped to its lowest point since 1968, violence involving the city's young people is unacceptably high; and

 WHEREAS, to respond to the high number of violent incidents involving youth, the City of Seattle brought together community leaders, School District representatives, and members of the faith community to review proven anti-violence strategies to develop a new approach to preventing youth and gang-related violence in Seattle; and

 WHEREAS, the Seattle Youth Violence Prevention Initiative (SYVPI) was developed to identify and help young people at the highest risk of perpetuating, or becoming victims of, violence at vulnerable points in their lives; and

 WHEREAS, the SYVPI proposes a new approach of using outreach workers to prevent violent acts and retaliation before they occur and to engage youth in pro-social activities; and

 WHEREAS, the SYVPI calls for establishing youth centers with extended hours, thereby giving youth a safe place to go or be taken to stay out of trouble; adding police officers in middle schools; improving school attendance, and training children to deal with conflict; supporting more community-based projects that engage and mentor young people; and providing youth employment opportunities; and

 WHEREAS, the SYVPI is being coordinated through three neighborhood networks in southeast, southwest, and central Seattle, and community organizations in the network areas have presented the City with plans describing how best to serve youth; and

 WHEREAS, the SYVPI is being charged to achieve a fifty percent reduction in court referrals for juvenile violent crime committed by youth living in the three network neighborhoods and a fifty percent reduction in the number of suspensions/expulsions due to violent incidents in five selected middle schools; and

 WHEREAS, the City Council placed a proviso on $1,259,247 in the 2009 Adopted Budget for the Finance General budget control level, as well as on $3,227,656 expected to be appropriated in 2010, all of which is to be spent solely for youth violence prevention once authorized by future ordinance; and

 WHEREAS, attached to the fiscal note that accompanies this legislation, the Executive is transmitting to Council a detailed response to Statement of Legislative Intent (SLI) #122-2-A-1 described in Ordinance 122863 and a plan outlining the strategic and financial components of the SYVPI and, through this SLI response and legislation, has satisfied the terms of the budget proviso; NOW, THEREFORE,
