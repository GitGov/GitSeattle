 AN ORDINANCE relating to taxation, amending the Seattle Municipal Code due to changes in the Revised Code of Washington as it pertains to the definition of telecommunications, and the state mandate regarding the required assignment and apportionment of gross receipts to local jurisdictions; making technical corrections; adding a new section 5.45.081; and amending sections 5.30.025, 5.30.050, 5.30.060, 5.45.075, 5.45.080, 5.45.100, and 5.48.050 of the Seattle Municipal Code.

 WHEREAS, in 2003 the Washington State Legislature passed HB 2030, now codified as RCW 35.102, which established mandatory provisions of a Model Ordinance to be used by cities that impose a gross receipts business and occupation tax; and

 WHEREAS, beginning on January 1, 2008, RCW 35.102 adds new tax requirements and restrictions to the Model Ordinance that must be adopted by cities within Washington that impose a gross receipts business and occupation tax; and

 WHEREAS, the City intends to comply with RCW 35.102 and adopt the amendments to the Model Ordinance; and

 WHEREAS, the State of Washington has adopted a new definition of "telecommunications service" that replaces the term "network telephone business" and the City desires to incorporate the new definition into its code; and

 WHEREAS, the City desires to add the definition of "delivery," make technical changes to the definitions of "competitive telephone service" and "value proceeding or accruing," and reword the deduction in SMC 5.45.100 J, which allows for a deduction of sales of tangible personal property when such property is delivered by the seller to the buyer at a point outside of Washington; NOW, THEREFORE,

 BE IT ORDAINED BY THE CITY OF SEATTLE AS FOLLOWS:

 Section 1. Effective January 1, 2008 Section 5.30.025 of the Seattle Municipal Code is amended as follows:

 5.30.025 Definitions, C -- D.

 E. "Competitive telephone service" means the providing by any person of telecommunications equipment or apparatus, or service related to that equipment or apparatus such as repair or maintenance service, if the equipment or apparatus is of a type which may be provided by persons not subject to regulation as telephone companies under RCW Title 80, and for which a separate charge is made. Competitive telephone service also includes ~~directory advertising and~~leasing of telephone street directories. Transmission of communication through cellular telephones is classified as "telephone business" rather than "competitive telephone service."

J. "Delivery" means the transfer of possession of tangible personal property between the seller and the buyer or the buyer's representative. Delivery to an employee of a buyer is considered delivery to the buyer. Transfer of possession of tangible personal property occurs when the buyer or the buyer's representative first takes physical control of the property or exercises dominion and control over the property. Dominion and control means the buyer has the ability to put the property to the buyer's own purposes. It means the buyer or the buyer's representative has made the final decision to accept or reject the property, and the seller has no further right to possession of the property and the buyer has no right to return the property to the seller, other than under a warranty contract. A buyer does not exercise dominion and control over tangible personal property merely by arranging for shipment of the property from the seller to itself. A buyer's representative is a person, other than an employee of the buyer, who is authorized in writing by the buyer to receive tangible personal property and take dominion and control by making the final decision to accept or reject the property. Neither a shipping company nor a seller can serve as a buyer's representative. It is immaterial where the contract of sale is negotiated or where the buyer obtains title to the property. Delivery terms and other provisions of the Uniform Commercial Code (Title 62A RCW) do not determine when or where delivery of tangible personal property occurs for purposes of Seattle's business license tax.

~~J.~~K. "Director" means the Director of Executive Administration of the city or any officer, agent or employee of the city designated to act on the Director's behalf.

~~K.~~L. "Distribution affiliate" means a partnership, limited liability company or other entity that sells merchandise to the customer-owners of the distribution cooperative and which is owned fifty (50) percent or more by the distribution cooperative.

~~L.~~M. "Distribution cooperative" means a person a) that itself sells, or owns fifty (50) percent or more of a distribution affiliate that sells, merchandise to its customer-owners for resale at retail, b) in which two-thirds of the aggregate outstanding voting ownership interest is owned by its customer-owners, c) that makes distributions to its customer-owners at least partly on the basis of patronage, and d) that qualifies for federal income tax purposes under the provisions of subchapter T of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended.

 b. The use of a single factor;

 7. "Tax period" means the calendar year during which tax liability is accrued. If taxes are reported by a taxpayer on a basis more frequent than once per year, taxpayers shall calculate the factors for the previous calendar year for reporting in the current calendar year and correct the reporting for the previous year when the factors are calculated for that year, but not later than the end of the first quarter of the following year.

 8. "Taxable in the customer location" means either that a taxpayer is subject to a gross receipts tax in the customer location for the privilege of doing business, or that the government where the customer is located has the authority to subject the taxpayer to gross receipts tax regardless of whether, in fact, the government does so.

 E. Assignment or apportionment of revenue under this section shall be made in accordance with and in full compliance with the provisions of the Interstate Commerce Clause of the United States Constitution where applicable.

 F. This section does not apply to allocate gross income of motor carriers included in the measure of the tax pursuant to subsection 5.45.050 F of the Seattle Municipal Code.
