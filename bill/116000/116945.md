 WHEREAS, the City issued a competitive Request for Proposals to solicit proposals for redevelopment of land located at 12th Avenue and East Jefferson Street; and

 WHEREAS, in response to the Request for Proposals, Capitol Hill Housing Improvement Program ("CHH") submitted a proposal dated May 23, 2008, to acquire the 12th Avenue and East Jefferson Street parcel and construct a mixed use project containing rental units; and

 WHEREAS, the Director of the City's Office of Housing has determined that the CHH proposal is complete and responsive to the Request for Proposals, and recommends that the City Council authorize transfer of ownership of the 12th Avenue and East Jefferson site to CHH or a designee approved by the Housing Director;

 NOW, THEREFORE,

 BE IT ORDAINED BY THE CITY OF SEATTLE AS FOLLOWS:

 Section 1. The Director of the Office of Housing ("Director") is authorized to enter into, enforce and perform an agreement ("Agreement") with Capitol Hill Housing Improvement Program, a Washington public corporation ("CHH") or a designee of CHH approved by the Director (CHH and any approved designee, and any assignee of the Agreement approved by the Director, are referred to as "Purchaser"), for the transfer of the property, legally described as:

 Parcels A and B, City of Seattle Short Plat Number 80- 148, as recorded under Recording Number 8202030663, said short plat being more particularly described as follows:

 Lots 13, 14, 15 and 16, Block "C", W.C. Squire's Replat of Block Eight of Squire Park Addition to the City of Seattle, according to the plat thereof recorded in Volume 10 of Plats, Page 18, records of King County, Washington; Except that portion thereof condemned for widening of 12th Avenue; situated in the City of Seattle

 (the "Property") on the terms and subject to the conditions authorized in this ordinance. The Agreement shall be in the form attached to this ordinance as Attachment 1, with such revisions and additions, not inconsistent with the express terms of this ordinance or applicable law, as the Director may determine are reasonably necessary to carry out the intent of this ordinance. The stated sale price for the Property is $1,028,000. All except $15,000 shall be deferred, and may be satisfied by nonfinancial performance, under a non-recourse promissory note ("Note") in accordance with the Agreement. In order to carry out the Agreement for and on behalf of the City, the Director is authorized to execute a deed for the Property in substantially the form attached hereto as an exhibit to Attachment 1, and upon satisfaction of the conditions precedent under the Agreement, except for any that may be waived in writing by the Director, the Director is authorized to cause the deed to be recorded and delivered to the Purchaser. The Director may grant the Purchaser and others permits to enter upon and perform investigations on the Property. The Director is authorized to execute, deliver, accept, record, modify, and administer such other documents, which may include amendments to the Agreement and extensions of deadlines under the Agreement, and take such other actions, as he or she shall deem necessary or advisable to implement the purpose of this ordinance.

 Section 2. The Agreement shall require Purchaser to use diligent efforts to pursue design work, financing applications, environmental reports, permit applications and all other steps necessary to construct and permanently finance improvements on the Property as described in Section 3 of this ordinance. Except as otherwise specified in the Agreement, all such efforts of Purchaser shall be at its own expense and risk. The Agreement shall terminate if the conditions to transfer of the Property by the City are not satisfied or waived in writing by the Director within 18 months of the effective date of this ordinance, except that one extension, not to exceed six months, may be granted by the Director if in his or her judgment an extension furthers the City's objectives. The Director may waive specific conditions to Closing in the Agreement, not including required payments or the execution and recording of closing documents, if in the Director's judgment the Purchaser has demonstrated its ability and willingness to perform substantially as contemplated by this ordinance and the Agreement.

 Section 3. The Agreement shall provide that if the transfer is completed, the improvements to be developed on the Property shall include no less than 35 dwelling units, with rents affordable to households with incomes not exceeding 60 percent of median income, as defined in the Agreement. The development, including the process of obtaining necessary regulatory approvals and construction of the housing and of ground floor commercial space in the same building on the Property, is referred to in this ordinance as the "Project".

 Section 4. The Agreement shall provide for the transfer of the Property to Purchaser after various conditions are satisfied, including those relating to land use, regulatory processes and financing. If a condition is not satisfied by the date required, the Director may terminate the Agreement. If the Purchaser fails to complete the Project or otherwise defaults after closing of the transfer but before construction is completed, the Director may take action to recover the Property for the City under the terms of the relevant documents, and may accept title for and on behalf of the City. If the Agreement terminates for any reason without transfer of the Property, or if the Director recovers the Property, the Director may arrange an alternative disposition of the Property, primarily for development of housing, on such terms and through such process as are then feasible in the judgment of the Director, subject to further approval by ordinance.

 Section 5. The Director is authorized to execute and deliver such additional documents, which may include amendments to the Agreement and related covenants, and to take such other actions, as may be necessary or appropriate to implement the intent of this ordinance, and to administer and enforce the Agreement, covenants, and any other such documents. The Director may approve a transfer of the Property to a limited partnership or limited liability company managed by CHH, or the designation by CHH of such an entity as Purchaser, if the Director finds such a transfer or designation is necessary for financing of the Project. In addition, the Director may grant a partial release of the City's covenant and deed of trust from a part of the Property, to be used for nonresidential purposes, that is included in a separate condominium unit from the housing, under condominium documents acceptable to the Director.

 Section 6. Payments made from escrow at closing, from funds deposited by or on behalf of the Purchaser, of prorated assessments and other costs payable by the City at closing pursuant to the terms of the Agreement, shall be credited toward payment of the purchase price of the Property. All funds payable from escrow to the City shall be deposited in the Low-income Housing Fund (16400).

 Section 7. The sale of the property authorized in Section 1 of this ordinance, and any disposition process commenced by the Director after any termination of the Agreement as authorized in Section 4 of this ordinance, are exempted from compliance with the property disposition policies and procedures previously or hereafter contained in or adopted by resolution, including Resolution 29799 as amended by Resolution 30862.

 Section 8. Nothing in this ordinance is intended or shall be construed to require that the City exercise its authority under its regulatory ordinances to permit the development of the Property as contemplated by this ordinance or the Agreement, nor binds the City to do so. The City Council has not made any determination, and is not expressing any opinion or intent, with respect to any proposed rezone of the Property.

 Section 9. Any action taken after the passage of this ordinance and pursuant to the authority herein prior to the effective date of this ordinance is hereby ratified and confirmed.

 Section 10. This ordinance shall take effect and be in force 30 days from and after its approval by the Mayor, but if not approved and returned by the Mayor within ten days after presentation, it shall take effect as provided by Seattle Municipal Code Section 1.04.020.

 Now, therefore, the parties hereto, for and in consideration of the promises and mutual obligations herein undertaken, do hereby agree as follows:

 PART I

 Section 1. Agreement to Buy and Sell Property.

 On the terms and subject to the conditions of this Agreement, the Seller agrees to sell and convey to Purchaser, and Purchaser agrees to buy from the Seller, that certain real property located at 500 12th Avenue in the City of Seattle, commonly known as 12th and Jefferson and legally described on the attached Exhibit A (the "Property"), generally located as shown on the map included in Exhibit A. Such map is attached solely for convenience of reference and does not qualify in any way the description of the Property, nor constitute or evidence any representation or warranty of any kind as to the Property dimensions or boundaries, or any other information shown thereon, it being the intent of the parties that the Purchaser assume the risk of any discrepancies or inaccuracies in such map.

 Section 2. Payment of Purchase Price; Conveyance; Security; Transfer of Property

 2.01 Price and Form of Payment.

 Purchaser agrees to pay to the Seller the sum of One Million, Twenty Eight Thousand and 00/100 Dollars ($1,028,000.00) (the "Purchase Price") for the Property. The Purchase Price is payable as follows: Fifteen Thousand and 00/100 Dollars ($15,000.00) in cash at Closing (defined in Section 7 below); and the balance pursuant to the terms of a non-recourse promissory note ("Note") in the form attached hereto as Exhibit B, which shall be executed by Purchaser and delivered to the Seller at Closing. The Note shall bear interest at a simple rate of 1% per annum.

 2.02 Conveyance

 A. Upon (i) the payment of the cash required at Closing under this Section 2 and all other amounts required to be paid by Purchaser at Closing hereunder, and (ii) the satisfaction of the conditions set forth in this Agreement, the Seller shall convey the Property, by Quitclaim Deed in the form attached hereto as Exhibit C (the "Deed"), which is hereby approved as to form by Purchaser.

 B. The Seller and Purchaser hereby disclose and agree as follows:

 1. the sale contemplated herein is voluntary. Purchaser does not have the power to acquire the Property by condemnation or eminent domain.

 2. Purchaser estimates the fair market value of the Property to the Purchase Price.

 2.03 Security for Note

 A. The Note shall be secured by a deed of trust, assignment of rents, security agreement and fixture filing in favor of the Seller, in form and content acceptable to Seller and Purchaser, which shall be delivered at Closing and shall initially be a first lien on the Property (the "Deed of Trust").

 B. Seller shall subordinate the lien of its Deed of Trust to the liens and covenants reasonably required for the Purchaser's financing of the development of the Property as contemplated in this Agreement (the "Project") with the sole exception of liens in favor of Purchaser or its affiliates. Any obligation of the Seller to subordinate its Deed of Trust to another lien is conditioned upon the delivery to Seller, at least 30 days in advance of the date when Purchaser desires a subordination agreement to be delivered, of the proposed form of subordination agreement and all documents related to the liens or encumbrances to which subordination is requested, as well as documents demonstrating to the satisfaction of the Seller that the conditions to subordination are satisfied or will be satisfied as of the date of deliver and recording of the subordination agreement. In addition, any subordination may be conditioned upon such changes to the form of subordination agreement as the Seller may require, and the issuance to the Seller of one or more endorsements to the Seller's title insurance policy, as the Seller may require. The Seller agrees to subordinate any reversionary interests under this Agreement, the Deed and the Deed of Trust as required for financing the development.

 2.04 Transfer to Subsequent Owner

 The parties acknowledge that to complete the financing for the Project, the Purchaser intends to convey the Property to a limited liability company, limited partnership or limited liability limited partnership controlled by the Purchaser ("Company"). If

 1. the Purchaser is otherwise in full compliance with the terms of this Agreement; and

 2. the Seller receives such title insurance or endorsements thereto as the Seller may require,

 then the Seller shall permit the conveyance of the Property to the Company, provided that the Company assumes all obligations of the Purchaser hereunder and subject to the prior satisfaction of any of the conditions of Part I, section 5 below that the Seller shall have waived as conditions to Closing.

 Section 3. Low-Income Housing

 3.01 Purpose of Sale; Purchaser to Make Diligent Efforts

 Seller is selling the Property to Purchaser to enable the Purchaser promptly to construct a building and related improvements on the Property, consistent with this Agreement, according to the plans to be approved by the Seller. The improvements on the Property are to be used primarily as housing for low-income households. Purchaser shall make diligent efforts to pursue design work, financing applications, environmental reports, permit applications and all other steps necessary to construct and permanently finance improvements on the Property as described in this Agreement.

 3.02 Units for Low-Income Households

 A. As a condition of Seller's obligations at Closing, the Purchaser shall execute, acknowledge and deliver for recording a Low-Income Housing Covenant ("Covenant"), to be mutually agreed upon by Seller and Purchaser, committing to use of the Property to include no less than 35 units of housing to be rented to low- income households, with rents affordable to such households, for a minimum of 50 years, subject to the exception described in subsection B in this Section below.

 B. After an initial period of approximately fifteen (15) years from the date the Project receives its certificate of occupancy, Purchaser shall have the option of converting some or all the rental units into condominium units that can be sold individually, provided the conversion of rental units is approved by Seller and is in compliance with all applicable laws and regulations. The units sold shall be sold to, and affordable to, Eligible Buyers based on a calculation acceptable to Seller. The units shall remain affordable to low-income households for a period of time acceptable to Seller, but not less than 35 years. Units sold shall be subject to deed restrictions, financing terms or other re-sale conditions, acceptable to Seller.

 C. Any units that are not sold in accordance with subsection B of this Section shall remain subject to the rental restrictions in the Covenant.

 D. For purposes of this Agreement:

 1. A "low-income household" is a household with annual income, at the time of initial occupancy of a housing unit, at or below 60% of the Median Income.

 2. An "Eligible Buyer" is a buyer of a dwelling unit in the Property whose household annual income at the time of the buyer's purchase thereof shall be 80% or less of Median Income and who intends to occupy the unit as the household's primary residence.

 3. "Median Income" means annual median family income, as published from time to time by HUD, for the Seattle-Bellevue HMFA, or for the Seattle- Tacoma-Bellevue Metropolitan Statistical Area, whichever is then generally used by HUD to establish income limits for federal programs in Seattle, or such other area including Seattle as HUD may use from time to time for the purpose of publishing median income, and as adjusted for household size according to the method used by HUD for income limits in subsidized housing. If, at any time, Median Income for a household size cannot be determined under the foregoing sentence based on data published by HUD for the Seattle area within the most recent thirteen months, then the City may determine "Median Income" for such household size based on any data for the Seattle area or an area including Seattle, published or reported by a federal, state, or local agency, as the City shall select in its sole discretion, adjusted for household size in such manner as the City shall determine in its sole discretion.

 4. A rental unit is considered "affordable" if the cost of rent and utilities does not exceed 30% of household income. A unit sold for owner occupancy is considered "affordable" if the cost of mortgage principal and interest, property taxes, insurance and homeowner association dues and/or assessments does not exceed 35% of household income.

 5. "HUD" means the United States Department of Housing and Urban Development and any other department or agency that shall succeed to its function with respect to low-income rental housing.

 Section 4.  Title Insurance

 4.01. The Seller shall at its expense provide Purchaser with an ALTA Standard Coverage Owner's policy of title insurance, issued by Pacific Northwest Title Insurance Company, Inc. or another title insurance company reasonably acceptable to Purchaser ("Title Company") in the amount of the Purchase Price of the Property, insuring Purchaser as the sole fee title holder of the Property, subject to the Permitted Exceptions as defined below in this Section, the terms of the Deed, the Covenant, and the Deed of Trust.

 4.02. Purchaser has reviewed a preliminary title commitment (the "Title Commitment") from Pacific Northwest Title Company of Washington, Inc, Order no. 688147, dated January 5, 2009, along with all documents referenced in the Title Commitment. Any claims, liens, encumbrances and defects shown thereon are hereby approved and accepted by Purchaser, except for exceptions 5 and 6 regarding property tax exceptions. The items so approved are the "Permitted Exceptions." Prior to the date of Closing, the Seller shall not further encumber the Property, or permit additional encumbrances to attach to the Property, without the express written consent of Purchaser. If title to the Property is not insurable under a standard owner's policy on the date fixed for Closing free and clear of all liens, except for the Permitted Exceptions and any that may be created or suffered by Purchaser, then unless the Purchaser elects to accept the liens or the parties, by mutual written agreement, extend the date for Closing to allow the Seller or the Purchaser to remove such liens, this Agreement shall immediately terminate, in which case the Seller shall return the Earnest Money to Purchaser, and neither party shall have any further liability or obligation, of any kind whatsoever, to the other under this Agreement (except pursuant to indemnity provisions, which survive termination of this Agreement).

 4.03. Purchaser may obtain such additional title insurance coverage as Purchaser chooses, as long as Purchaser pays any difference in the cost between the standard coverage policy provided by the Seller and the increased premium due from any increase in coverage.

The parties acknowledge that the issuance of a MUP for the Project depends upon a decision by the Seattle City Council to rezone the Property as requested by Purchaser, and that nothing in this Agreement constitutes any assurance or commitment as to any rezoning decision.

 C. Purchaser shall have provided evidence satisfactory to the Director that Purchaser has commitments for the necessary financing to fund the construction of the Project as provided in Section 306.

Without limiting the generality of subsection A of this Section, Purchaser agrees that, except as may be specifically set forth in Part II, Subsection 2.01.C of this Agreement, neither Seller nor any person for whom Seller may have any responsibility makes any representation, warranty or promise of any kind with regard to any of the following: (1) the physical condition of the Property (land, buildings, fixtures, or infrastructure), whether or not readily determined by inspection and whether or not information related to such condition is in the possession of the Seller; (2) the presence or absence of any underground tanks or any hazardous or defective substances or conditions on or about the Property, or on adjacent properties; (3) the history of the Property or activities that may have occurred or been conducted thereon or thereunder; (4) soils conditions or drainage; (5) square footage of land or buildings; (6) encroachments; or (7) location or condition of utility lines.

 C. The Seller has entered into an agreement ("Cleanup Agreement") dated August 20, 2010 with TOC Holdings Co. ("TOC"), a prior owner of the Property, under which TOC agrees to conduct or cause to be conducted a remedial action on the Property to address the presence of the Hazardous Substances on the Property as identified and described in the Reports, with a scope intended by Seller to meet the applicable cleanup standards for residential uses determined by the Washington State Department of Ecology ("Ecology") under Chapter 173-340 Washington Administrative Code. The Purchaser has reviewed the Cleanup Agreement and a remedial action plan ("Plan") prepared by a consultant retained by TOC ("Consultant"). Purchaser has authorized the Consultant to submit on Purchaser's behalf an application to DOE for participation in its Voluntary Cleanup Program with respect to the Property, and has submitted the Plan to DOE for that purpose. Purchaser has not agreed and does not agree to implement any part of the Plan, nor does Purchaser agree to pay for any costs to implement the Plan or any fees or costs of the Consultant. As between Seller and Purchaser, all costs of the Plan and of the Consultant are the obligation of Seller. Purchaser has authorized the Consultant to communicate directly with DOE, on behalf of Purchaser as proponent of the Plan, including the submission of a request, after completion of the remedial action, for a letter from DOE stating that that no further remedial action is necessary on the Property ("NFA determination"). Purchaser acknowledges, however, that DOE may decline to issue a NFA Determination for the Property, and may require institutional controls and/or deed restrictions on the Property. Purchaser shall have the right to review and approve of any such controls or restrictions prior to Seller agreeing to the same or recording the same in the real property records. In consideration of the foregoing Seller obligations, Purchaser assigns to the Seller any and all claims, causes of action and/or rights of recovery that it may have or may acquire after purchase of the Property to recover remedial action costs related to the remediation of the Hazardous Substances identified in the Reports from any person(s) other than the Seller, as such costs are defined under the Washington State Model Toxics Control Act, ch. 70.105D RCW (MTCA) as amended, or the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act, 42 U.S.C. sections 9601 et seq. (CERCLA) as amended, or any other federal or state Environmental Law. In consideration of such assignment of claims, causes of action and/or rights of recovery, the Seller shall complete the Seller's Environmental Work December 31, 2010 and shall request and make best good faith efforts to secure from Ecology an NFA Determination no later than May 31, 2011, time being of the essence. Seller shall indemnify, defend and hold Purchaser harmless from 1) Seller's failure to complete the Seller's Environmental Work in a manner consistent with all Environmental Laws; 2) the presence of any Hazardous Substances identified in the Reports on or under any property other than the Property to the extent those Hazardous Substances originated from or migrated from the Property; and 3) any re-contamination of the Property from the Hazardous Materials identified in the Reports that have migrated or will migrate off the site and are not remediated as part of the Seller's Environmental Work. Seller acknowledges that Purchaser is relying on Seller's completion of the Seller's Environmental Work prior to December 31, 2010 and its best good faith efforts to request and obtain the NFA Determination prior to May 31, 2011, that Purchaser will incur substantial development costs in reliance upon such promise, and that Seller's failure to complete the Seller's Environmental Work by such date shall be a breach of Seller's obligations hereunder and give rise to Purchaser's rights described in section 702.

 1. Seller and Purchaser each shall promptly disclose to the other all communications between such party and DOE regarding the Property, and promptly provide the other party with copies of any written communications to or from DOE regarding the Property. Neither Purchaser nor Seller shall make or authorize any commitment to DOE with respect to the Property without the express written consent of the other party.

 2. If Purchaser is not satisfied with the Completion Report, then Purchaser shall have the right, by written notice to the Seller within thirty (30) days after receipt of the Completion Report, to terminate this Agreement and receive a refund of all Earnest Money as well as other damages, limited to reasonable out-of-pocket costs as described in Section 702. If Purchaser states in writing that the Completion Report is satisfactory to Purchaser, or if Purchaser does not give timely notice of termination under this subsection 2.01.C(2), then as between Seller and Purchaser all obligations of the Seller with respect to remediation shall be conclusively deemed satisfied.

 D. Nothing herein is intended to waive or impair any right or remedy that Purchaser or Seller may have against any third party related to any Hazardous Substances on or under the Property.

 E. The term "Hazardous Substances" in this Agreement shall mean any and all hazardous, toxic, infectious or radioactive substances, wastes or materials as defined or listed by any Environmental Law, and shall specifically include petroleum oil and its fractions.

 F. The term "Environmental Law" in this Agreement shall mean any local, state or federal law or regulation, ordinance or order pertaining to the protection of human health and/or the environment,`` as now in effect or hereafter amended, including, but not limited to: the Federal Clean Air Act; the Federal Clean Water Act; the Federal Safe Drinking Water Act; the Federal Comprehensive Environmental Response Compensation and Liability Act, as amended by the Superfund Amendments and Reauthorization Act of 1986; the Federal Resource Conservation and Recovery Act, as amended by the Solid and Hazardous Waste Amendments of 1984; the Federal Occupational Safety and Health Act; the Federal Emergency Planning and Right-to-Know Act of 1986; the Federal Hazardous Materials Transportation Control Act of 1980; the Federal Waste Management Recovery and Recycling Act; the Federal Toxic Substances Control Act; the Washington Hazardous Waste Management Act; Washington Model Toxics Control Act; the Washington Water Pollution Control Act; the Washington Underground Petroleum Storage Tanks Act; the Washington Industrial Safety and Health Act; the Washington Worker and Community Right to Know Act; the Washington Oil and Hazardous Substance Spill Prevention and Response Act; and any regulations promulgated there under from time to time.

 G. Except as otherwise expressly provided herein, Purchaser hereby irrevocably releases and waives any and all claims that Purchaser has or may have against City and its officers, employees and agents with respect to the condition of the Property or arising pursuant to CERCLA, as amended, or MTCA, or any other environmental law. The provisions of this Section 2.01 shall not be construed to limit in any way the scope of the release, covenants and indemnity obligations to be granted and assumed by the Purchaser under the Deed. Seller by the initials below acknowledge that this Section 2.01 has been specifically bargained for and that Seller would not be willing to sell the Property on the terms and conditions set forth in the rest of this Agreement without Purchaser's agreement to this Section.

 Purchaser:_______ Seller:_________

 2.02 Changes in Condition

 A. Purchaser has inspected the Property in its present condition as of the date of this Agreement and such inspection has not disclosed any physical condition that would materially impair the development thereof as contemplated hereunder, except the environmental conditions set forth in the Reports referenced in Part II, Subsection 2.01.A.

 B. If prior to Closing Seller becomes aware of any material adverse change in the physical condition of the Property or any portion thereof after the date of this Agreement, other than substantially as contemplated by the remediation Plan described in Section 2.01, or if Seller shall become aware of any Hazardous Substances on the Property not previously disclosed in the Reports (a "Seller-Discovered Changed Condition"), Seller shall notify Purchaser within ten (10) days of becoming aware of such Seller-Discovered Changed Condition, and in any event prior to Closing.

 C. If prior to Closing Purchaser becomes aware of any change in the physical condition of the Property or any portion thereof after the date of this Agreement, other than from the remediation described in Section 2.01 above, or if Purchaser shall become aware of material Hazardous Substances on the Property not previously disclosed in the Reports, in each case that would materially impair the feasibility of the Project or would substantially increase the costs of the Project (a "Purchaser-Discovered Changed Condition"), Purchaser shall within ten (10) days of becoming aware of such Purchaser-Discovered Changed Condition, and in any event prior to Closing.

 D. The term "Changed Condition" shall refer to either a Purchaser-Discovered Changed Condition or a Seller-Discovered Changed Condition or both.

 1. If the Changed Condition is caused by Purchaser or its agents, employees or contractors, Purchaser shall have the option to either restore the Property to its prior condition, complete its purchase of the Property hereunder, or both.

 2. If the Changed Condition is caused by the Seller or its agents, employees or contractors, the Seller shall at its discretion (i) restore the Property to its prior condition and reimburse Purchaser for Purchaser's damages caused by the Changed Condition or the Seller's restoration of the Property, or (ii) terminate this Agreement by written notice to Purchaser and return the Earnest Money as well as other damages as may be described in section 702.

 3. If neither Purchaser nor the Seller is responsible for the Changed Condition, then (i) if, within fifteen (15) days after the Seller sends or receives written notice of the Changed Condition, the Seller gives written notice to Purchaser that the Seller elects to remedy the Changed Condition, then this Agreement shall remain in effect and the Seller shall remedy the Changed Condition prior to Closing, or (ii) if the Seller does not give written notice of such election within said fifteen (15) days, then Purchaser shall have the option, by written notice to the Seller no later than fifteen (15) days after sending or receiving notice of the Changed Condition, either (A) to terminate this Agreement, in which case the Seller shall return the Earnest Money and neither party shall have any further obligation or liability to the other under this agreement (except pursuant to indemnity provisions, which survive termination of this Agreement), or (B) to assume the risk of the Changed Condition and complete the purchase of the Property.

 E. Together with any notice required under this Section 2.02, each party shall, to the extent they have not already done so, provide the other party with a copy of any reports or findings in its possession or control that disclose the Changed Condition or describe how such Changed Condition would in fact materially impair the development of the Property as contemplated hereunder, or would substantially increase the cost of such development.

 Section 203. Possession

 As between Seller and Purchaser, Purchaser's right to possession of the Property (subject to any rights of the Seller reserved in the Deed) shall be effective upon recording of the Deed.

 Section 204. Licenses for Entry

 A. At any time and from time to time prior to Closing and prior to any termination of this Agreement, the Purchaser may request access for Purchaser's employees, agents and contractors to the Property, for the purpose of conducting therein and thereon such inspections and studies as Purchaser may reasonably deem necessary or appropriate with respect to evaluating its condition and designing the Project. Purchaser shall make any such request in writing at least 5 days prior to the first date when it desires such access and shall state the specific purposes for entry on the Property, the names of any agents or contractors involved, and the nature of any tests or other activities intended. The Seller will not unreasonably withhold or delay consent to such entry for purposes within the scope of this Section, provided that entry will not interfere with the remediation described in Section 2.01 of Part II, above or with the terms of the Cleanup Agreement, and provided that Purchaser, and its agents or contractors if applicable, agree in writing to terms and conditions, including indemnity and release provisions, in a form of permit for entry ("Permit") acceptable to Seller.

 B. The covenants, releases and indemnities of Purchaser and any such other person in any Permit(s), whether granted before or after execution of this Agreement, shall be in addition to, and not in substitution for, the covenants, waivers and indemnities hereunder, are not superseded by this Agreement, and shall survive the Closing or termination of this Agreement.

 Section 205. Indemnification Regarding Entry.

 Purchaser hereby agrees to release and forever discharge, indemnify, defend and hold the City, and its elected officials, employees and agents, harmless from and against any and all liability, including without limitation any claims, liability, costs, damages or fees (including but not limited to reasonable attorneys' fees and costs) incurred as a result of or in connection with Purchaser's entry onto the Property, and including but not limited to Purchaser's release of any Hazardous Substances thereon, but only to the extent such liability does not arise from the negligent or wrongful actions of the City.

 The term "Hazardous Substances" for purposes of this Section shall mean any and all hazardous, toxic, infectious or radioactive substances, wastes or materials as defined or listed by any federal, state or local statute, regulation or ordinance pertaining to the protection of human health or the environment and shall specifically include petroleum oil and its fractions.

 SUBPART 300 - PLANS, APPROVALS, FINANCING AND CONSTRUCTION

 Section 301. Community Meetings on Design

 If so requested by the Director, Purchaser agrees to periodically provide progress reports to the community and attend at least one community meeting, in addition to any meetings required by the MUP/Design Review process, to present the architectural design and hear comments from neighboring residents and businesses, which comments shall not be binding upon Purchaser or require Purchaser to amend the design or other documents relating to the Project.

 Section 302. Construction Documents

 A. Purchaser shall prepare plans and specifications with respect to the construction of the Project (the "Construction Documents") substantially consistent with the approved Schematic Design and Summary Description all applicable state and local laws and regulations. The Construction Documents shall be sufficiently complete and detailed to satisfy requirements pertinent to application for a building permit to DPD and to demonstrate to the Director that the Project will be in accordance with the previously approved Schematic Design and Summary Description.

 B. Purchaser shall submit one set of the Construction Documents, together with a construction or progress schedule, to the Director at the same time as Purchaser submits the Construction Documents to DPD for the purpose of obtaining a building permit.

 Section 303. Changes in Design or Construction Documents

 A. The Director shall review the Construction Documents solely for the purpose of determining whether they substantially conform to the Schematic Design and Summary Description. The Director shall have ten (10) business days after receipt of the Construction Documents to notify the Purchaser in writing of any objections to the design as shown in the Construction Documents. Such written notice shall contain a statement of the specific reasons for such objection. Purchaser may within thirty (30) days after receiving Director's written notice of objection, submit a revision of the proposed changes, which shall be subject to the timely review described in Section 305 of this Agreement, unless the revisions are manifestly inconsistent in material respects with the approved Design or Summary Description. If in the Director's judgment the revised proposed changes satisfy the Director's objections stated in the Director's prior written notice of rejection or otherwise satisfy the criteria set forth above, the Director shall approve the revised proposed changes and evidence her approval by endorsement of the same on the revised plan sheets and by notifying the Purchaser in writing.

 B. If the revised proposed changes do not satisfy the Director's written objections or the criteria set forth above, the Director may reject the revised proposed changes and the Seller may terminate this Agreement by written notice to Purchaser and the Escrow Agent, in which case the Earnest Money shall be returned to the Purchaser. Neither party shall have any further liability or obligation, of any kind whatsoever, to the other under this Agreement (except pursuant to indemnity provisions, which survive termination of this Agreement).

 Section 304. Permits

 A. As a condition precedent to the Seller's obligation to sell the Property to the Purchaser, a Master Use Permit for the development of the Property consistent with the Schematic Design and Summary Description (as the same may have been modified with the consent of the Seller hereunder) must have been issued by the Department of Planning and Development (DPD), or DPD must have given notice that such permits are ready to issue.

 B. The Seller acknowledges that the development of the Project and the requirements of this Agreement necessitate that Purchaser apply for and obtain certain permits and other similar authorizations (collectively, the "Permits") from the City and other governmental agencies relating to the Property and the Project prior to Purchaser obtaining fee title to the Property. The term "Permits" shall include without limitation zoning changes, use permits; building permits; short plats and lot boundary adjustments and other similar authorizations and approvals; grading permits; shoring permits; permits for work in public rights-of- way; and utility permits.

 C. Nothing in this Agreement is intended or shall be construed to require that the City exercise its discretionary authority under its regulatory ordinances to further the development of the Property, nor binds the City to do so. The City will process applications for Permits as if such applications were made in the absence of this Agreement. Purchaser assumes the risk of inability to obtain any such approvals, consents, or permits, for any reason. No consent, approval or requirement contained in or made by the Director of Housing or her designees pursuant to this Agreement shall constitute the approval, consent, or Permit required for any regulatory or other City purpose, nor require the City to grant any such approval, consent, or Permit. No regulatory requirement, condition or recommendation related to any Permit shall constitute approval for any change in the Schematic Design and Summary Description or for any Construction Plans or changes therein, nor obligate the Director of Housing to grant any such approval. The Director will not unreasonably withhold approval of changes to the Schematic Design and Summary Description necessitated by the MUP/Design Review process.

 Section 305.  Timely Review of Changes in Design or Plans

 If, with respect to any transmittal or submission of any changes to the Schematic Design and Summary Description or Construction Documents, the Director does not give Purchaser written notice of her objection thereto and reasons therefore within ten (10) business days of receiving such documents, then if the first page of the transmittal conspicuously stated the effect of this Section with express reference hereto, the documents as transmitted to the Director shall be deemed approved.

 Section 306. Financing Commitment

 A. Purchaser represents that Purchaser will use its best efforts to obtain financing commitments ("Financing Commitments") from one or more lending entities (individually and collectively, the "Lender(s)") to finance the construction of the Project.

 B. As a condition precedent to the Seller's obligations hereunder, Purchaser shall provide to the Office of Housing copies of Financing Commitments from the Lender(s), that demonstrate to the satisfaction of the Director that Purchaser will obtain all financing necessary to complete the Project in accordance with this Agreement, the Schematic Design and Summary Description and the Construction Documents, and that no term of any Financing Commitment is in material conflict with the terms of this Agreement, the Schematic Design and Summary Description or the Construction Documents.

 Section 3.07 Completion of Improvements.

 Purchaser shall develop the Property with improvements substantially consistent with the Schematic Design and Summary Description, as it may be modified in accordance with this Agreement, and in compliance with all applicable state and local laws and regulations.

 A. Except as otherwise provided in this Agreement, in the event that any of the following occurs:

 1. The Seller fails to tender conveyance of the Property or otherwise fails to satisfy its obligation to close the sale of the Property in the manner required herein after satisfaction of the conditions provided in this Agreement and receipt of a notice to close from Purchaser as specified herein, and any such failure shall not be cured within thirty (30) days after notice from the Purchaser; or

 then Purchaser shall have the right to terminate this Agreement by notifying Seller in writing of its desire to do so, and upon such notice the Escrow Agent shall return the Earnest Money to the Purchaser and Purchaser shall have the right, as its sole remedy, to proceed against the Seller for actual damages, limited to reasonable out- of-pocket costs directly related to development of the Property. Such termination, recovery of Earnest Money and proceeding for such damages shall be Purchaser's only remedies for breach or default by the Seller at or prior to Closing.

 B. As used in this Section, the term "out-of- pocket costs" excludes administrative or overhead costs, excludes legal fees to the extent not incurred as part of the financing and development of the project, and also excludes consequential damages of any kind whatsoever, such as but without limitation lost profits, lost business opportunities or interference with business or contractual expectancies.

 then at the option of the Seller, at any time thereafter, this Agreement and any rights of Purchaser or of any assignee or transferee in this Agreement or arising therefrom with respect to the Seller or the Property shall be terminated by written notice from Seller to Purchaser of such termination, and the Earnest Money shall be paid to and retained by the Seller.

 B. The Earnest Money is intended as liquidated damages and not as a penalty, and in case of termination under this Section retention of the Earnest Money shall be Seller's sole and exclusive remedy. If the Purchaser's rights shall be terminated under this Section neither party shall have any further liability or obligation, of any kind whatsoever, to the other under this Agreement (except pursuant to indemnity provisions, which survive termination of this Agreement).

 Section 704. Other Rights and Remedies; No Waiver of Delay

 Either party shall have the right to institute such actions or proceedings as it may deem desirable for effectuating its remedies, subject to express limits herein. Any delay by either party in instituting or prosecuting any such actions or proceedings or otherwise asserting its rights under this Agreement shall not operate as a waiver of any rights or remedies or to deprive it of or limit such rights or remedies in any way; nor shall any waiver in fact and in writing made with respect to any specific default be considered or treated as a waiver of the rights or remedies of either party with respect to any other defaults or with respect to the particular default except to the extent specifically waived in writing.

The obligation to indemnify and defend shall include, but not be limited to, any liability of Grantor to any and all federal, state or local regulatory agencies or other persons or entities for remedial action costs and natural resources damages claims. This Release and Indemnity means that Grantee accepts the Property "as-is, where-is and with-all-faults," and that Grantee assumes all responsibility of Grantor to investigate, remove and remediate any environmental conditions on the Property and has no recourse against Grantor or any of its officers, employees or agents for any claim or liability with respect to the Property.
