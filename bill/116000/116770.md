 AGREEMENT FOR USE OF SEATTLE

 CITY LIGHT TRANSMISSION LINE EASEMENT RIGHT-OF-WAY

 P.M. # 270533-1-001 A-F

 This Agreement, is entered into by and between the City of Seattle, a municipal corporation of the State of Washington ("City"), acting by and through Seattle City Light ("SCL") and PDI Properties, Inc. (formerly known as Phoenix Development, Inc.), a Washington Corporation ("Contract Purchaser") as of this ___ day of _______________, 2009.

 WHEREAS, Contract Purchaser controls certain real property, upon which it is developing a single-family, residential subdivision plat in Section 33, Township 27 North, Range 5 East, W.M., Snohomish County, Washington, which is known as the Talasera Project, Snohomish County Project File Number: 07-100489-000-00-SD ("Project") as legally described in Exhibit A attached and incorporated herein; and

 WHEREAS, SCL owns, operates and maintains municipal electrical transmission facilities and necessary appurtenances ("SCL electrical facilities") pursuant to various recorded easements that affect generally the westerly 75 feet of the property involved in the Project ("Transmission ROW Easement Area"); and

 WHEREAS, the Contract Purchaser desires the consent of SCL to use a portion of the Transmission ROW Easement Area to install, operate and maintain stormwater drainage facilities, including a subsurface stormwater detention vault, a flow splitter and a level spreader, along with necessary appurtenances ("Talasera Drainage Facilities") on the property to serve and manage the resulting increased stormwater runoff and water quality from the whole Project area in accordance with state and local laws and requirements; and

 WHEREAS, SCL may consent to structures, improvements or facilities in its Transmission ROW Easement Area in certain limited circumstances where SCL determines that it is in the public interest and the Contract Purchaser and any future owners meet certain conditions to avoid interference with SCL's easement rights and and to ensure that SCL electrical facilities and operations are adequately protected.

 Now, therefore, the parties mutually agree to the following:

 SCL hereby consents to the Contract Purchaser and Contract Purchaser's successors and assigns specifically including but not limited to, all of the future owners of the lots in the subdivision (all future owners are collectively referred to as "Users" and are the successors and assigns of the Contract Purchaser), using a portion of the Transmission ROW Easement Area for the sole purpose of installing and maintaining the Talasera Drainage Facilities for the Project, subject to the following terms and conditions:

 1. Neither the Contract Purchaser, nor the Users will construct, install, place or allow any building, structure or improvement within the Transmission ROW Easement Area except those Talasera Drainage Facilities as included in the plans for project PFN: 07-100489-000-00-SD ("Plans") that have been reviewed and approved by Snohomish County and accepted by SCL. SCL's acceptance of the Plans has been granted as of the date of this Agreement. If for any reason, the Plans undergo a significant change in design prior to or during initial construction, Contract Purchaser shall submit the new plans to SCL for its review and approval. In addition, the Contract Purchaser agrees and represents that the Talasera Drainage Facilities will meet the following upon completion of construction:

 A. All applicable Washington State Department of Ecology 1992 Stormwater Manual requirements, including but not limited to ensuring that facilities that are designed and constructed to the appropriate size and controlled flow releases which will match the pre-developed flows for 1/2 of the 2- year, 10-year and 100-year storm events; and

 B. All applicable Snohomish County code or permit requirements; and

 C. SCL operational requirements that the detention vault, level spreader, and all access roads are designed and constructed to the American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials (AASHTO) Standard Specifications for Highway Bridges HS-20 design truck vehicle loading capacity.

 This consent is for the specific Talasera Drainage Facilities as designed and included in the Plans based on the size of the Project as approved and the resulting increased stormwater runoff from impervious surfaces to be constructed in accordance with the Plans, together with the right to reconstruct or replace the Talasara Drainage Facilities as designed and included in the Plans in the unlikely event that reconstruction or replacement becomes necessary. This consent does not include consent for any future expansion, or improvement of the Talasera Drainage Facilities, nor consent for the Talasera Drainage Facilities to manage any additional stormwater runoff due to future expansion or new facilities in the subdivision.

 2. The Contract Purchaser shall, upon completion of any construction of the Talasera Drainage Facilities, remove all debris and restore the Transmission ROW Easement Area as nearly as possible to the condition in which it existed prior to any construction by the Contract Purchaser or its agents. The Contract Purchaser agrees to submit to SCL a copy of as- built plans for the Talasera Drainage Facilities upon completion of the construction.

 3. The Contract Purchaser, to the extent it retains ownership or control of the Project, or the Users will perform regular maintenance upon the Talasera Drainage Facilities in accordance with any state or local laws or requirements and this Agreement. Regular maintenance shall include, at a minimum, annual inspection of the Talasera Drainage Facilities. Qualified representatives of SCL may inspect the Talasera Drainage Facilities, and in the event SCL determines that required maintenance is not being performed, SCL shall endeavor to provide the party with ownership or control of the Talasera Drainage Facilities, i.e. the Contract Purchaser or Users, reasonable advance notification of the need to perform the maintenance and a reasonable opportunity for that party to perform or cause to perform it. In the event that the Contract Purchaser or Users fail to complete the required maintenance within a reasonable time period, qualified representatives of SCL shall have the right to perform or contract with qualified others to perform it at the sole expense of the Contract Purchaser or Users, as appropriate. If qualified representatives of SCL, in their sole discretion determine that an imminent or present danger exists, SCL may perform any required maintenance or repair without prior notice at the sole expense of the party with ownership or control of the Talasera Drainage Facilities, i.e. the Contract Purchaser or Users. In such event, SCL shall provide the Contract Purchaser or Users with a written statement and accounting of all work performed and the fees, charges, and expenses incurred in performing such maintenance or repairs. The Contract Purchaser or Users shall promptly reimburse SCL or pay SCL's vendors directly for all reasonable fees, charges, and expenses identified in SCL's statement. If SCL is required to act as a result of the Contract Purchaser's or Users' failure to comply with this provision, SCL may remove any obstructions or interferences that in the sole opinion of SCL may impair the operation or maintenance of the Talasera Drainage Facilities or cause damage to SCL's electrical facilities.

 4. The Contract Purchaser and Users each understand and agree that any consent given herein is subject to the existing rights of the City under its existing easements and, if any, of other parties. Nothing in this Agreement shall be construed to alter the terms of existing easements. The City does not waive or subordinate any of the rights and privileges granted to the City by the easements for transmission line purposes. The City reserves its existing rights under the relevant easements to locate any transmission line facilities, support structures or any other necessary appurtances, within the Transmission ROW Easement Area, including that portion with Talasera Drainage Facilities, if necessary, in the future.

 5. Neither the Contract Purchaser nor the Users shall perform any construction, reconstruction, grading or regrading, place any fill, or place or manage any sediment from the Talasera Drainage Facilities within the Transmission ROW Easement Area except as authorized by this Agreement, the Plans, or in writing by SCL.

 6. The Contract Purchaser, to the extent it retains ownership or control of the Project, or the Users, agree to install and maintain improvements such as guard posts or curbing, at no cost to SCL, necessary to protect the existing or future SCL electrical facilities located within the Transmission ROW Easement Area from damage during Contract Purchaser's or Users' inspection, maintenance or repair of the Talasera Drainage Facilities. Neither the Contract Purchaser nor Users will allow vehicles or other equipment within five (5) feet of said poles or within ten (10) feet of said towers.

 7. Neither the Contract Purchaser or Users shall at any time interfere with SCL's access to and over the Transmission ROW Easement Area and SCL's facilities except as may be allowed by this Agreement.

 8. If the Contract Purchaser's or Users' use of the Transmission ROW Easement Area should at any time become a hazard to existing or future SCL electrical facilities or interfere with the inspection, maintenance, operation, repair of or access to such facilities, as determined by SCL, the Contract Purchaser or Users, upon thirty (30) days' written notice or other time as agreed in writing by SCL, will remove or correct such hazard or interference at their own expense. If the Contract Purchaser or Users fail to remove or correct such hazard or interference, SCL may, at its election, remove or correct such hazard or interference without liability to the Contract Purchaser or Users for loss, injury or damage thereto, and the cost of such removal or correction shall be paid promptly by the appropriate party, i.e. the Contract Purchaser or Users upon demand by SCL.

 While the Talasara Drainage Facilities may be modified to eliminate a hazard or interference problem, in no event may SCL remove the Talasara Drainage Facilities. In the event that public storm drainage facilities become available to the Project in the future, the Users will connect to such facilities within a reasonable time and properly remove or abandon the Talasera Drainage Facilities at Users' sole expense in accordance with any state or local requirements in effect at that time.

 9. The Contract Purchaser agrees to install fencing or other protective barrier system to separate the residential lots from the Talasera Drainage Facilities to help protect the facilities from interference, vandalism or dumping in order to maintain proper operation of the Talasera Drainage Facilities. Any fencing or other barriers installed within the Transmission ROW Easement Area shall be grounded according to SCL Engineering Standard E 1-7.1 as necessary. If any fencing is installed across the Transmission ROW Easement Area, the Contract Purchaser shall install and either the Contract Purchaser, to the extent it retains ownership or control of the Project, or the Users shall maintain gates that allow SCL access to the Transmission ROW Easement Area at any time.

 10. The Contract Purchaser agrees to plant and either the Contract Purchaser, to the extent it retains ownership or control of the Project, or the Users shall maintain vegetation and erosion control measures in and around the level spreader in accordance with the Plans. Neither the Contract Purchaser nor the Users will allow any plantings within the Transmission ROW Easement Area higher than twelve (12) feet. If either the Contract Purchaser or the Users do not maintain said plantings at a height below 12 feet as required herein, SCL shall have the right to trim the plantings and charge the appropriate party for the cost of such work; and SCL shall not be liable for damage to the plantings as a result of this trimming.

 11. The Contract Purchaser and Users each agree that any construction, use of equipment, or maintenance it performs within the Transmission ROW Easement Area shall be in accordance with the National Electric Safety Code and shall comply with any other applicable State or local laws governing construction or work near overhead or underground electrical facilities, including any required safety clearances.

 12. This Agreement is for the consent to use the Transmission ROW Easement Area for the sole purposes described and under the conditions stated herein only, and shall not be construed to replace or to be used in lieu of any applicable permits or licenses which may be required, granted or supervised by any other agency or subdivision of government charged with licensing, policing and supervising the operations or other rights of the Contract Purchaser or Users.

 13. The Contract Purchaser and Users each agree to assume all risk of loss, damage or injury which may result from the Contract Purchaser's, Users' or their representatives' use of the Transmission ROW Easement Area. The Contract Purchaser and Users each understand and agree that any damage to SCL's facilities or property, caused by or resulting from that party's use of the Transmission ROW Easement Area, may be repaired by SCL at the that party's expense, which costs shall be paid promptly upon receipt of an invoice from SCL.

 14. The Contract Purchaser and Users each agree that the City of Seattle shall not be liable for any damages to the Project property or the Talasera Drainage Facilities by reason of any construction, maintenance, operations or repairs performed on SCL electrical facilities or within the Transmission ROW Easement Area related to the SCL electrical facilities by SCL, its agents or representatives except to the extent those damages are caused by the negligence of SCL, its agents or representatives.

 15. During construction of the Talasara Drainage Facilities, Contract Purchaser or its successors and assigns, shall maintain in effect, with the City of Seattle named as an additional insured, a general liability insurance policy with minimum limit of $2 Million Dollars annual aggregate, insuring against loss or damage arising out of or resulting from the use of the Transmission ROW Easement Area by the Contract Purchaser, and to furnish the Superintendent of City Light a certificate evidencing that this policy is in effect. At all times following recording of the final plat for the Project, the Users, via a Homeowners' Association or any successor thereto, shall maintain in effect, with the City of Seattle named as an additional insured, a general liability insurance policy with minimum limit of $1 million annual aggregate, insuring against loss or damage arising out of or resulting from the use of the Transmission ROW Easement Area by the Users, and to furnish to the superintendent of City Lights a certificate evidencing this policy is in effect.

 16. The Contract Purchaser and Users understand that scientific studies concerning potential health effects of power frequency electric and magnetic fields (EMF) have been and are being conducted. Contract Purchaser acknowledges receipt of City Light Policy on EMF and Human Health, and the informational booklet "Electric and Magnetic Fields from 60 Hertz Electric Power: What do we know about possible health risks?" by the Department of Engineering and Public Policy, Carnegie Mellon University.

 17. The Contract Purchaser, to the extent it retains ownership or control of the Project, and the Users each agree to defend, protect and hold harmless the City, its officials, employees and agents from any and all claims, actions or damages of every kind and description which may arise out of or be in connection with installation, operation, maintenance, repair or use of the Transmission ROW Easement Area for the Talasera Drainage Facilities by the Contract Purchaser, Users or their respective officers, employees or agents; and in case of any such suit or action being brought against the City, or damages arising out of or by reason of any of the above causes, the Contract Purchaser or Users shall, upon notice of commencement of such action, defend the same at no cost or expense to the City and will fully satisfy any judgment after the said suit shall have been finally determined, if adversely to the City of Seattle. The City agrees to defend, protect and hold harmless the Contract Purchaser and Users and their officers, employees and agents from any and all claims, actions or damages of every kind and description which may arise out of or be in connection with installation, operation, maintenance, repair or use of the Transmission ROW Easement Area by the City; and in case of any such suit or action being brought against the Contract Purchaser or Users, or damages arising out of or by reason of any of the above causes, the City shall, upon notice of commencement of such action, defend the same at no cost or expense to the Contract Purchaser or Users and will fully satisfy any judgment after the said suit shall have been finally determined, if adversely to the Contract Purchaser or Users.

 18. The Contract Purchaser and Users each covenant and agree that neither they nor their agents or representatives will store, dump, bury or transfer any hazardous substances, flammable materials, inoperable vehicles, chemicals, oils, fuels, or containers for said substances, chemicals, oils, fuels, etc., within the Transmission ROW Area, and further agree to observe all environmental laws of the State of Washington, City of Seattle, or any other governmental subdivision or agency having regulatory authority over such activities within the Transmission ROW Easement Area.

 19. The Contract Purchaser and the City agree that the terms and conditions in this Agreement shall be a covenant running with the land and binding on the parties, their heirs, successors and assigns, forever, including the future owners of all the lots in the subdivision Project that will be served by the Talasera Drainage Facilities. The Contract Purchaser understands and agrees that it will include the following provision in a recordable covenant or in the recorded Covenant, Conditions, and Restrictions ("CC&Rs") for the Project, which will bind all future owners of the lots in the subdivision to the provisions of this Agreement, including any Homeowners' Association, if any.

 The Talasera Homeowners' Association, or its successor, hereby covenants and agrees to abide by that certain Consent Agreement with Seattle City Light, dated ____________, and recorded on _____________, 2009, in the records of Snohomish County, Washington.
