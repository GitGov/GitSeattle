 Library Major Maintenance

 BCL/Program Name: Library Major Maintenance BCL/Program Code: B301111 Project Type: Rehabilitation or Restoration Project ID: B301111 Start Date: Ongoing End Date: Ongoing Location: Various Neighborhood Plan: Not in a Neighborhood Plan Neighborhood District: In more than one District Neighborhood Plan Matrix: N/A Urban Village: In more than one Urban Village

 This ongoing project provides for major maintenance to Library facilities, which include the 363,000 square foot Central Library and 26 branch libraries. Typical improvements may include, but are not limited to, structural and mechanical repairs, safety and security upgrades, lighting and signage improvements, wall and floor surface repairs, landscape and exterior hard surface maintenance, and projects that enhance service delivery at our libraries. This project preserves building integrity and functionality, and provides responsible management of the Library's building assets to ensure their long-term operational use. The project was created in 2009 in connection with midyear budget reductions to facilitate efficient asset management. Ongoing Library asset management work is consolidated in this new project from the following projects: Building Systems, Landscape and Hardscape Restoration, Minor Capital Improvements, Operational Efficiency Improvements, Roof and Structural Systems, and Safety, Security and Access Improvements.
