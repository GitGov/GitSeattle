C. A complete building permit application for construction of a new principal structure on the same lot as the structure to be demolished has been submitted to the Director, the demolition permit application and the building permit application are categorically exempt from review under Chapter 25.05, Environmental Policies and Procedures, the issuance of some other approval is not required by Title 23 or Title 25 as a condition to issuing the demolition permit, and the Director has approved a waste diversion plan pursuant to Section 23.40.007; or

~~D. The housing unit(s) to be demolished have been continuously vacant since January 1, 1974.~~

 Section 2. A new Section 23.40.007 of the Seattle Municipal Code is adopted to read as follows:

 23.40.007 Reuse and Recycling of Building Materials in a Structure Containing a Dwelling Unit.

 A. Requirements of a Waste Diversion Plan. The Director shall promulgate rules that define the requirements of an acceptable waste diversion plan within the meaning of subsection 23.40.006C. Among the requirements shall be minimum levels of building materials that must be diverted from landfills. The levels shall be established by the Director on the basis of a review of practices employed in the relevant industries in the region. The levels may vary by disposal method or type of material and shall reflect, in the Director's opinion, the degree of waste diversion reasonably attainable through the use of accepted industry practices. The Director may alter the levels as industry practices evolve.

 B. Demonstration of Compliance. The applicant shall demonstrate compliance with the approved waste diversion plan by submitting a report to the Director documenting, at a minimum, the amount and manner in which building materials were diverted from landfills. The applicant must submit the report no later than 90 days after issuance of the demolition permit, or such later date as may be allowed by the Director for good cause.

 C. Violation. Failure to demonstrate compliance with the waste diversion plan is a violation of the Land Use Code.

 Section 3. Section 23.90.018 of the Seattle Municipal Code, which Section was last amended by Ordinance 122611, is amended as follows:

 23.90.018 Civil enforcement proceedings and penalties.

 A. In addition to any other remedy authorized by law or equity, any person violating or failing to comply with any of the provisions of Title 23 shall be subject to a cumulative penalty of up to ~~One Hundred Fifty Dollars ($150.00)~~$150 per day for each violation from the date the violation begins for the first ten ~~(10)~~days of noncompliance; and up to ~~Five Hundred Dollars ($500)~~$500 per day for each violation for each day beyond ten ~~(10)~~days of noncompliance until compliance is achieved, except as provided in subsection B of this section. In cases where the Director has issued a notice of violation, the violation will be deemed to begin for purposes of determining the number of days of violation on the date compliance is required by the notice of violation.

 B. Specific Violations.

 1. Violations of Section 23.71.018 are subject to the penalty in the amount specified in Section 23.71.018 H.

 2. Violations of Section 23.44.041 C are subject to a civil penalty of ~~Five Thousand Dollars ($5,000)~~$5,000, which shall be in addition to any penalty imposed under subsection A of this section.

 3. Violation of Section 23.49.011, 23.49.015 or 23.50.051 with respect to failure to demonstrate compliance with commitments to earn LEED Silver ratings or satisfy alternative standards under any such Section are subject to penalty in amounts determined under Section 23.49.020, and not to any other penalty.

4. Violation of Section 23.40.007 B with respect to failure to demonstrate compliance with a waste diversion plan for a structure permitted to be demolished under subsection 23.40.006 C is subject to a penalty in an amount determined as follows:  P = SF x .02 x RDR,

 where:

 P is the penalty;

 SF is the total square footage of the structure for which the demolition permit was issued; and

 RDR is the refuse disposal rate, which is the per ton rate established in SMC Chapter 21.40, and in effect on the date the penalty accrues, for the deposit of refuse at City recycling and disposal stations by the largest class of vehicles.

C. Civil actions to enforce Title 23 shall be brought exclusively in Seattle Municipal Court except as otherwise required by law or court rule. The Director shall request in writing that the City Attorney take enforcement action. The City Attorney shall, with the assistance of the Director, take appropriate action to enforce Title 23. In any civil action filed pursuant to this chapter, the City has the burden of proving by a preponderance of the evidence that a violation exists or existed. The issuance of the notice of violation or of an order following a review by the Director is not itself evidence that a violation exists.

 D. Except in cases of violations of Section 23.49.011, 23.49.015, or 23.50.051 with respect to failure to demonstrate compliance with commitments to earn LEED Silver ratings or satisfy alternative standards, the violator may show as full or partial mitigation of liability:

 1. That the violation giving rise to the action was caused by the willful act, or neglect, or abuse of another; or

 2. That correction of the violation was commenced promptly, but that full compliance within the time specified was prevented by inability to obtain necessary materials or labor, inability to gain access to the subject structure, or other condition or circumstance beyond the control of the defendant.

E. Use of Penalties. A subfund shall be established in the City's General Fund to receive revenue from penalties under subsection B of this section. Revenue from penalties under that subsection shall be allocated to activities or incentives to encourage and promote the development of sustainable buildings. The Director shall recommend to the Mayor and City Council how these funds should be allocated.

Section 4. This ordinance shall take effect and be in force thirty (30) days from and after its approval by the Mayor, but if not approved and returned by the Mayor within ten (10) days after presentation, it shall take effect as provided by Municipal Code Section 1.04.020.
