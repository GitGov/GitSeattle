 ORDINANCE _________________

 AN ORDINANCE relating to the creation of a Seattle-King County Taxicab Advisory Commission to advise and make recommendations to the Seattle City and King County Legislative and Executive bodies, establishing a new Chapter to the Seattle Municipal Code, and repealing Chapter 3.63 of the Seattle Municipal Code.

 WHEREAS, the Seattle-King County Taxicab Commission was dissolved in 1990; and

 WHEREAS, The City of Seattle has authority to issue taxicab licenses and to regulate taxicabs and drivers for the city; and

 WHEREAS, King County has the authority to issue taxicab licenses and to regulate taxicabs and drivers for unincorporated King County, and through interlocal agreements, for some cities within King County; and

 WHEREAS, In recent years, the City of Seattle and King County have changed their municipal codes to modify how taxicab licenses are issued and modified regulations regarding taxicabs and drivers; and

 WHEREAS, a Seattle-King County Taxicab Advisory Commission, comprised of representatives from all sectors and users of the taxi industry, would add transparency and advisory oversight to taxicab rulemaking; and

 WHEREAS, it is the intent of the Seattle City Council to include representation in such a commission of the "for-hire" and towncar industry in the future, acknowledging that current state law prohibits Seattle to regulate "for-hire" and towncar vehicles in the same way as taxicabs; and WHEREAS, it is in the public interest that an advisory commission be formed to advise elected officials with the City of Seattle and King County regarding the rational provision of taxicab services throughout the county, and to help ensure the provision of high-quality taxi service while ensuring the economic viability of owning and driving taxicabs; and
