 Chapter 1

 ADMINISTRATION

 SECTION 101

 TITLE, PURPOSE AND SCOPE

 101.1 Title. This subtitle shall be known as the "Seattle Building Code," may be so cited, and is referred to herein as "this code."

 101.2 Scope. The provisions of this code apply to the construction, alteration, moving, demolition, repair and occupancy of any building or structure within the City, except public utility towers and poles, mechanical equipment not specifically regulated in this code, and hydraulic flood control structures. See Chapter 32 for regulation of structures located on, over or under public property or a public right of way.

 Exception: Detached one- and two-family dwellings and multiple single-family dwellings (town houses) not more than three stories above grade plane in height with a separate means of egress and their accessory structures shall comply with the International Residential Code.

 101.3 Additions, alterations, repairs and change of occupancy. Additions, alterations, repairs, and changes of occupancy or character of occupancy in all buildings and structures shall comply with the provisions for new buildings and structures, except as otherwise provided in Chapter 34 of this code.

 Note: If a structure is constructed and maintained in compliance with standards and procedures of the Seattle Residential Code currently in effect, as well as the Seattle Building, Mechanical, Fire, Electrical and Plumbing Codes currently in effect, the Seattle Housing and Building Maintenance Code, SMC 22.200-22.208 does not apply.

 101.4 Purpose. The purpose of this code is to provide minimum standards to safeguard life or limb, health, property and public welfare by regulating and controlling the design, construction, quality of materials, occupancy, location and maintenance of all buildings and structures within the City and certain equipment specifically regulated herein. The purpose of this code is to provide for and promote the health, safety and welfare of the general public, and not to create or otherwise establish or designate any particular class or group of persons who will or should be especially protected or benefited by the terms of this code.

 101.5 Internal consistency. Where in any specific case, different sections of this code specify different materials, methods of construction or other requirements, the most restrictive governs. Where there is a conflict between a general requirement and a specific requirement, the specific requirement is applicable.

 101.6 Referenced codes. The codes and standards referenced in this code are considered part of this code to the extent prescribed by each such reference. Where differences occur between provisions of this code and referenced codes and standards, the provisions of this code apply.

 101.7 Appendices. Provisions in the appendices of the International Building Code do not apply unless specifically adopted.

 [W]1 101.8 Conflict with Ventilation Code. In the case of conflict between the ventilation requirements of this code and the ventilation requirements of Washington Administrative Code Chapter 51-13 the Washington State Ventilation and Indoor Air Quality Code (VIAQ), the provisions of the VIAQ govern.

 101.9 Metric units. Wherever in this ordinance there is a conflict between metric units of measurement and English units, the English units govern.

 SECTION 102

 UNSAFE BUILDINGS, STRUCTURES OR PREMISES

 102.1 Definition. For the purpose of this section, "unsafe buildings, structures or premises" include all buildings or structures and all premises immediately surrounding such buildings or structures, whether erected before or after the effective date of this code, that are structurally unsound or unsafe or not provided with adequate egress, or that constitute a fire hazard, or are otherwise dangerous to human life, or that, in relation to existing occupancy constitute a hazard to safety, health or public welfare by reason of inadequate maintenance, deterioration, instability, dilapidation, obsolescence, damage by fire or other causes or abandonment as specified in this code or any other effective ordinance.

 102.2 Emergency orders. Whenever the building official finds that any building or structure, or portion thereof is in such a dangerous and unsafe condition as to constitute an imminent hazard to life or

 limb, the building official may issue an emergency order directing that the building or structure, or portion thereof be restored to a safe condition by a date certain. The order shall be posted on the premises or personally served on the owner of the building or premises and /or any person responsible for the condition and shall specify the time for compliance. The order may also require that the building or structure, or portion thereof, be vacated within a reasonable time to be specified in the order. In the case of extreme danger, the order may specify immediate vacation of the building or structure, or may authorize immediate disconnection of the utilities or energy source. No person may occupy a building or structure, or portion thereof, after the date on which the building is required to be vacated until the building or structure, or portion thereof, is restored to a safe condition as required by the order and this code. It is a violation for any person to fail to comply with an emergency order issued by the building official.

 102.3 Hazard correction order. Whenever the building official finds that an unsafe building, structure or premises exists, the building official may issue a hazard correction order specifying the conditions causing the building, structure or premises to be unsafe and directing the owner or other person responsible for the unsafe building, structure or premises to correct the condition by a date certain. In lieu of correction, the owner may submit a report or analysis to the building official analyzing said conditions and establishing that the building, structure or premises is, in fact, safe. The building official may require that the report or analysis be prepared by a licensed engineer and may require compliance with Chapter 34. It is a violation for any person to fail to comply with a hazard correction order as specified in this subsection.

 SECTION 103

 VIOLATIONS AND PENALTIES

 103.1 Violations. It is a violation of this code for any person to:

 1. erect, construct, enlarge, repair, move, improve, remove, convert, demolish, equip, occupy, inspect or maintain any building or structure in the City, contrary to or in violation of any of the provisions of this code;

 2. knowingly aid, abet, counsel, encourage, hire, induce or otherwise procure another to violate or fail to comply with this code;

 3. use any material or to install any device, appliance or equipment that does not comply with applicable standards of this code or that has not been approved by the building official;

 4. violate or fail to comply with any final order issued by the building official pursuant to the provisions of this code or with any requirements of this code.

 5. remove, mutilate, destroy or conceal any notice or order issued or posted by the building official pursuant to the provisions of this code, or any notice or order issued or posted by the building official in response to a natural disaster or other emergency.

 103.2 Notice of violation. If, after investigation, the building official determines that standards or requirements of this code have been violated or that orders or requirements have not been complied with, the building official may serve a notice of violation upon the owner, agent, or other person responsible for the action or condition. The notice of violation shall state the standards or requirements violated, shall state what corrective action, if any, is necessary to comply with the standards or requirements, and shall set a reasonable time for compliance. The notice shall be served upon the owner, agent or other responsible person by personal service or regular first class mail addressed to the last known address of such person. If no address is available after reasonable inquiry, the notice may be posted in a conspicuous place on the premises. The notice may also be posted even if served by personal service or first class mail. The notice of violation shall be considered an order of the building official if no request for review before the building official is made pursuant to Section 103.3. Nothing in this section limits or precludes any action or proceeding to enforce this chapter, and nothing obligates or requires the building official to issue a notice of violation prior to the imposition of civil or criminal

 penalties.

 103.3 Review by the building official for notice of violation

 103.3.1 Any person affected by a notice of violation issued pursuant to Section 103.2 may obtain a review of the notice by making a request in writing within ten days after service of the notice. When the last day of the period computed is a Saturday, Sunday, federal or City holiday, the period runs until 5:00 p.m. of the next business day.

 The review shall occur not less than ten nor more than twenty days after the request is received by the building official unless otherwise agreed by the person requesting the review.

 Any person aggrieved by or interested in the notice of violation may submit additional information to the building official.

 103.3.2 The review shall be made by a representative of the building official who will review any additional information that is submitted and the basis for issuance of the notice of violation. The reviewer may request clarification of the information received and a site visit.

 After the review, the building official shall:

 1. Sustain the notice; or

 2. Withdraw the notice; or

 3. Continue the review to a date certain; or

 4. Amend the notice.

 103.3.3 The building official shall issue an order containing the decision within 15 days of the date that the review is completed and shall cause the order to be mailed by regular first class mail to the persons requesting the review and the persons named on the notice of violation, addressed to their last known addresses.

 103.4 Judicial review. Because civil actions to enforce Title 22

 SMC are brought in Seattle Municipal Court pursuant to Section 103.5.2, orders of the building official issued under this chapter are not subject to judicial review pursuant to chapter 36.70C RCW.

 103.5 Civil penalties.

 103.5.1 Any person violating or failing to comply with the provisions of this code shall be subject to a cumulative civil penalty in an amount not to exceed $500 per day for each violation from the date the violation occurs or begins until compliance is achieved. In cases where the building official has issued a notice of violation, the violation will be deemed to begin, for purposes of determining the number of days of violation, on the date compliance is required by the notice of violation.

 103.5.2 Civil actions to enforce this chapter shall be brought exclusively in Seattle Municipal Court, except as otherwise required by law or court rule. In any civil action for a penalty, the City has the burden of proving by a preponderance of the evidence that a violation exists or existed; the issuance of a notice of violation or of an order following a review by the building official is not itself evidence that a violation exists.

 103.6 Alternative criminal penalty. Anyone who violates or fails to

 comply with any order issued by the building official pursuant to this code or who removes, mutilates, destroys or conceals a notice issued or posted by the building official shall, upon conviction thereof, be punished by a fine of not more than $5000 or by imprisonment for not more than 365 days, or by both such fine and imprisonment. Each day's violation or failure to comply shall constitute a separate offense.

 103.7 Additional relief. The building official may seek legal or equitable relief to enjoin any acts or practices and abate any condition when necessary to achieve compliance.

 103.8 Recording of notices.

 103.8.1 The building official may record a copy of any order or notice with the Department of Records and Elections of King County.

 103.8.2 The building official may record with the Department of Records and Elections of King County a notice that a permit has expired without a final inspection after reasonable efforts have been made to provide a final inspection.

The building official may, but is not required to, record the approval of modifications and any relevant information in the files of the building official or on the approved permit plans.

 104.10 Alternate materials, methods of construction and design. This code does not prevent the use of any material, design or method of construction not specifically allowed or prohibited by this code, provided the alternate has been approved and its use authorized by the building official. The building official may approve an alternate, provided the building official finds that the proposed alternate complies with the provisions of this code and that the alternate, when considered together with other safety features of the building or other relevant circumstances, will provide at least an equivalent level of strength, effectiveness, fire resistance, durability, safety and sanitation. Certain code alternates have been pre-approved by the building official and are identified in this code as numbered code alternates. The building official may require that sufficient evidence or proof be submitted to reasonably substantiate any claims regarding the use or suitability of the alternate. The building official may, but is not required to, record the approval of modifications and any relevant information in the files of the building official or on the approved permit plans.

 Section 8. The following findings of fact are adopted in accordance with Washington Administrative Code 51-04-030 in support of amendments to Sections 704.6 and 705.2.:

 o Seattle is situated in an area with a high likelihood of seismic activity, having experienced three significant earthquakes in the past 60 years, and having a fault line traversing densely-populated and heavily-developed areas.

 o Seattle has experienced a greater rate of damage to buildings resulting from earthquakes than most other jurisdictions in Washington.

 o Continuity of diaphragms is critical to lateral stability of buildings under seismic conditions.

 o The average response time of the Seattle Fire Department in 2006 for fire, rescue and hazardous materials was 4.31 minutes, among the shortest response times in the area.

 o Risk of injury from buildings collapsing due to earthquakes is greater than the risk from buildings collapsing due to insufficient support during a fire.

 o The following requirements of the International Building Code are inconsistent with good seismic design: Section 704.6 that requires exterior walls to remain in place for the duration of time indicated by its fire-resistance rating; and Section 705.2 that requires fire walls to be constructed so as to remain standing when the construction on either side of it collapses due to fire.

 o These requirements that walls remain standing for the duration of time indicated by the fire-resistance rating are not consistent with the applicable testing standards, which do not measure the ability of walls to remain standing when adjacent construction collapses under fire conditions.

 o The deletion of IBC Sections 704.6 and 705.2 does not diminish the minimum performance standards of RCW 19.27.020, and deletion of those provisions from the Seattle Building Code enhances the safety of residents of the City of Seattle.

 Section 9. The following sections of Chapter 7 of the International Building Code, 2006 Edition, are amended as follows:

The live loads acting on a sloping surface shall be assumed to act vertically on the

 horizontal projection of that surface.

 1607.11.1 Distribution of roof loads. Where uniform roof live loads are reduced to less than 20 psf (0.96 kN/m2) in accordance with Section 1607.11.2.1 and are involved in the design of structural members arranged so as to create continuity, the minimum applied loads shall be the full dead loads on all spans in combination with the roof live loads on adjacent spans or on alternate spans, whichever produces the greatest effect. See Section 1607.11.2 for minimum roof live loads and Section 7.5 of ASCE 7 for ~~partial~~ snow loading.

 1607.11.2 Reduction in roof live loads. The minimum uniformly distributed roof live loads, Lo, in Table 1607.1 are permitted to be reduced according to the following provisions.

 1607.11.2.1 Flat, pitched and curved roofs. Ordinary flat, pitched and curved roofs are permitted to be designed for a reduced roof live load as specified in the following equation or other controlling combinations of loads in Section 1605, whichever produces the greater load. In structures where special scaffolding is used as a work surface for workers and materials during maintenance and repair operations, a lower roof load than specified in the following equation shall not be used unless approved by the building official. Greenhouses shall be designed for a minimum roof live load of 12 psf (0.58 kN/m2).

 Lr = Lo R1R2 (Equation 16-27)

 where: 12 For SI: Lr = Lo R1R2

 where: 0.58 Lr = Reduced live load per square foot (m2) of horizontal projection in pounds per square foot (kN/m2).

 The reduction factors R1 and R2 shall be determined as follows:

 R1 = 1 for At (18.58 m2) (Equation 16-28)

 R1 = 1.2 - 0.001At for 200 square

 feet For SI: 1.2 - 0.011At for 18.58 square meters R1 = 0.6 for At > 600 square feet

 (55.74 m2) (Equation 16-30)

 where:

 At = Tributary area (span length multiplied by effective width) in square feet (m2) supported by any structural member, and

 R2 = 1 for F R2 = 1.2 - 0.05 F for 4 R2 = 0.6 for F > 12 (Equation 16-33)

 where:

 F = For a sloped roof, the number of inches of rise per foot (for SI: F = 0.12 x slope, with slope expressed as a percentage), or for an arch or dome, the rise-to-span ratio multiplied by 32.

 1607.11.2.2 Special-purpose roofs. Roofs used for promenade purposes, roof gardens, ~~assembly purposes~~ or other special purposes shall be designed for a minimum live load as required in Table 1607.1. Such roof live loads are permitted to be reduced in accordance with 1607.9 for other than roofs used for assembly purposes. ~~

~~1607.11.2.3 Landscaped roofs. Where roofs are to be landscaped, the ~~uniform design live load in the landscaped area shall be 20 psf (0.958 kN/m2). The~~ weight of the landscaping materials shall be considered as dead load and shall be computed on the basis of saturation of the soil.

 1607.11.2.4 Awnings and canopies. Awnings and canopies shall be designed for uniform live loads as required in Table 1607.1 as well as for snow loads and wind loads as specified in Sections 1608 and 1609.

The placement of buildings and structures on or adjacent to slopes steeper than one unit vertical in three units horizontal (33.3-percent slope) shall conform to Sections 1805.3.1 through 1805.3.5.~~1805.3.1 Building clearance from ascending slopes. In general, buildings below slopes shall be set a sufficient distance from the slope to provide protection from slope drain-age, erosion and shallow failures. Except as provided for in Section 1805.3.5 and Figure 1805.3.1, the following criteria will be assumed to provide this protection. Where the existing slope is steeper than one unit vertical in one unit horizontal (100-percent slope), the toe of the slope shall be assumed to be at the intersection of a horizontal plane drawn from the top of the foundation and a plane drawn tangent to the slope at an angle of 45 degrees (0.79 rad) to the horizontal. Where a retaining wall is constructed at the toe of the slope, the height of the slope shall be measured from the top of the wall to the top of the slope.

 1805.3.2 Footing setback from descending slope surface. Footings on or adjacent to slope surfaces shall be founded in firm material with an embedment and set back from the slope surface sufficient to provide vertical and lateral support for the footing without detrimental settlement. Except as provided for in Section 1805.3.5 and Figure 1805.3.1, the following setback is deemed adequate to meet the criteria. Where the slope is steeper than 1 unit vertical in 1 unit horizontal (100-percent slope), the required setback shall be measured from an imaginary plane 45 degrees (0.79 rad) to the horizontal, projected upward from the toe of the slope.

 1805.3.3 Pools. The setback between pools regulated by this code and slopes shall be equal to one-half the building footing setback distance required by this section. That portion of the pool wall within a horizontal distance of 7 feet (2134 mm) from the top of the slope shall be capable of supporting the water in the pool without soil support.

 1805.3.4 Foundation elevation. On graded sites, the top of any exterior foundation shall extend above the elevation of the street gutter at point of discharge or the inlet of an approved drainage device a minimum of 12 inches (305 mm) plus 2 percent. Alternate elevations are permitted subject to the approval of the building official, provided it can be demonstrated that required drainage to the point of discharge and away from the structure is provided at all locations on the site.

 1805.3.5 Alternate setback and clearance. Alternate setbacks and clearances are permitted, subject to the approval of the building official. The building official is permitted to require an investigation and recommendation of a registered design professional to demonstrate that the intent of this section has been satisfied. Such an investigation shall include consideration of material, height of slope, slope gradient, load intensity and erosion characteristics of slope material.

This section applies to all construction activities on or within 1,000 feet (305 m) of an active, closed or abandoned landfill (landfill zone) that has been identified by the building official to be generating levels of methane gas on-site at the lower explosive limits or greater levels. The distance shall be calculated from the location of the proposed structure to the nearest property line of the active or former landfill site. The building official is permitted to waive these requirements if technical studies demonstrate that dangerous amounts of methane are not present on the site.

 1813.2 Protection of Structures. All enclosed structures to be built within the 1,000 foot (305 m) landfill zone shall be protected from potential methane migration. The method for protecting a structure from methane shall be identified in a report prepared by a licensed civil engineer and submitted by the applicant to the

 department for approval. The report shall contain a description of the investigation and recommendations for preventing the accumulation of explosive concentrations of methane gas within or under enclosed portions of the building or structure. At the time of final inspection, the civil engineer shall furnish a signed statement attesting that, to the best of the engineer's knowledge, the building or structure has been constructed in accordance with the recommendations for addressing methane gas migration.

 3405.2 Residential buildings or structures. Residential buildings or structures moved into or within the city are not required to

 comply with all of the requirements of this code if the original occupancy classification of the building or structure is not changed. Compliance with all of the requirements of this chapter will be

 required if the moved residential buildings or structures undergo substantial alteration. Work performed on new and existing foundations shall comply with all of the requirements of this code for new construction.

 SECTION 3406

 CHANGE OF OCCUPANCY

 No change shall be made in the character of occupancies or use of any building that would place the building in a different division or subdivision of the same group of occupancy or in a different group of occupancies, unless such building is made to comply with the requirements of this chapter and the requirements of Chapters 4, 5 and 9 for such division or group of occupancy. Change of tenants will be permitted so long as the character of the occupancy is not changed.

 Exception: The character of the occupancy of existing buildings is permitted to be changed subject to the approval of the building official, as set forth in Section 3404. The building is permitted to be occupied for purposes in other groups without conforming to all the requirements of this code for those groups, if the new or proposed use is not more hazardous, based on life and fire risk, than the existing use.

 No change in the character of occupancy of a building shall be made without a certificate of occupancy, as required in Section 109

 of this code. The building official is authorized to issue a certificate of occupancy pursuant to the above exception without certifying that the building complies with all provisions of this
