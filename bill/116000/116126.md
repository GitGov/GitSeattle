 AN ORDINANCE amending SMC 4.04.120 to add an expectation that the Seattle City Council will hold a public hearing on police accountability at least ninety days before the City begins collective bargaining on a new contract with the Seattle Police Officer's Guild or the Seattle Police Management Association or their successor labor organizations.

 WHEREAS, RCW 41.56 sets forth the City of Seattle's responsibilities to bargain in good faith with the City's employees and the City respects and honors the collective bargaining process; and

 WHEREAS, The mission of the Seattle Police Department is to prevent crime, enforce laws and support quality public safety by delivering respectful, professional and dependable police services; and

 WHEREAS, Effective policing depends in part on the public's confidence in the fairness and integrity of the Seattle Police Department and its policing practices; and

 WHEREAS, The Seattle Police Officers Guild (SPOG) represents all uniformed members in the Seattle Police Department up to and including sergeants; and

 WHEREAS, The Seattle Police Management Association (SPMA) represents all lieutenants and captains in the Seattle Police Department; and

 WHEREAS, Seattle has a multilayered police oversight system that includes the Office of Professional Accountability (OPA), the OPA Auditor and the OPA Review Board that all play a role in the City's police accountability system; and

 WHEREAS, Recognizing the importance for elected officials to hear directly from the public on the effectiveness of the City's police accountability system in a timely manner, the City Council passed Resolution 30871 providing for a public hearing on the issue of police accountability before the City begins collective bargaining agreement negotiations with the SPOG; and

 WHEREAS, elected officials will equally benefit from a public hearing on the effectiveness of the police accountability system before beginning collective bargaining agreement negotiations with the SPMA; and

 WHEREAS, the purpose of these hearings is informational only and not to establish the City's position in collective bargaining; and
