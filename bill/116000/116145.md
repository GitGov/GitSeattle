 SMC 25.21.034 Criteria for District designation.

 The Fort Lawton Historic District is significant for its association with the development and the history of the City of Seattle and for its embodiment of the characteristics of military interpretations of American architectural styles of the 1890s and early 1900s, based on standard Quartermaster General building designs, as well as its planned site. The period of significance for the Fort Lawton Historic District is from 1898 to 1945, based on the development of the post, with additional buildings and site features resulting from the Depression-era public works, and the fort's role in World War II.

 SMC 25.21.040 Design review guidelines.

 A. The Landmarks Preservation Board shall draft and, after consideration and review in accordance with SMC 3.02, shall adopt design review guidelines as rules which shall become effective upon filing with the City Clerk. Notice and conduct of such public hearing(s) shall be in accordance with the rules of the Landmarks Preservation Board and SMC 3.02.

 B. The design review guidelines shall identify the unique values of the District, shall include a statement of purpose and intent, and shall be consistent with the purposes of this chapter. The guidelines shall identify design characteristics which have either a positive or negative effect upon the unique values of the District and shall specify design-related considerations which will be allowed, encouraged, limited or excluded from the District when certificate of approval applications are reviewed. C. Until the Board adopts guidelines pursuant to subsection A, the Landmarks Preservation Board shall review any application for a certificate of approval using the Secretary of the Interior's Standards for Rehabilitation and Guidelines for Rehabilitating Historic Properties.

 SMC 25.21.050 District Administration.

 Jurisdiction over changes and improvements to the District is vested in the Board. However in order to maintain adequate community involvement and contact, an Application Review Committee is created which shall consist of five (5) members, two (2) members of the Landmarks Preservation Board, at least one (1) of whom shall be an architect, two (2) members. one selected from District property owners and/or residents and one selected from representatives of organizations that have a demonstrated interest in the history and preservation of the Fort Lawton Landmark District, and one (1) member recommended by the Superintendent of Parks.

 The members of the committee shall be appointed annually by the Chair of the Board. The committee shall review and make recommendations to the Board for issuance or denial of applications for certificates of approval within the District.

 SMC 25.21.054 Relationship between Landmark Board review and responsibilities of other City departments.

 The function of the Landmarks Board under SMC 25.21.060 is to review public or private applications for certificates of approval to demolish, alter or construct buildings, structures and site elements located within the District, for consistency with the landmarks criteria prescribed in SMC 25.21.110. It is not the function of the Landmarks Board to regulate the use of property within the District, which is the responsibility of the Department of Planning and Development, or to manage the use of City owned property within the District, which is the responsibility of the Department of Parks and Recreation.

 Privately owned properties located in the Landmark District are not located in Discovery Park, and therefore are not subject to the Discovery Park Long Range Development Plan or to the authority of the Department of Parks and Recreation.

 City owned properties located in the Landmark District are within the boundaries of Discovery Park and their management and use shall be consistent with the Discovery Park Long Range Development Plan. The Superintendent of Parks, with the advice of the Seattle Board of Park Commissioners, is the principal authority in matters relating to implementation of the Discovery Park Long-Range Development Plan, including City-owned properties within the Landmark District. The Superintendent of Parks has the primary responsibility for managing and maintaining these properties within the District, subject to the authority of the Landmarks Board as described in this Chapter. Therefore, all matters affecting the use and operation of these City-owned properties shall be approved by the Superintendent of Parks with advice from the Board of Park Commissioners.

 SMC 25.21.060 Approval of significant changes to buildings, structures and other property.

 Within the District, a certificate of approval, issued by the Landmarks Preservation Board, is required prior to the issuance of any City building, demolition, street use, or other permits for proposed work which work is within or visible from public property and, which involves:

 A. The demolition of, or exterior alterations or additions to, any building or structure;

 B. Any new construction;

 C. The addition or removal of major landscape and site elements, such as retaining walls, gateways, trees or driveways.

 In addition, for proposed removal or addition of significant landscape and site elements which are within or visible from public property but for which permits are not required, and which are identified specifically in the District development and design review guidelines, a certificate of approval from the Board is also required prior to the initiation of the proposed work.

 SMC 25.21.080 Application for certificate of approval.

 A. Application.

 1. Application for a certificate of approval may be made by filing an application for such a certificate with the Board.

 2. The following information must be provided in order for the application to be complete, unless the special review board staff indicate in writing that specific information is not necessary for a particular application:

 a. Building name and building address;

 b. Name of the business(es) located at the site of the proposed work;

 c. Applicant's name and address;

 d. Building owner's name and address;

 (2) A floor plan showing the existing features and a floor plan showing the proposed new features,

 (3) Elevations and sections of both the proposed new features and the existing features,

 3. The staff shall determine whether an application is complete and shall notify the applicant in writing within twenty-eight (28) days of the application being filed whether the application is complete or that the application is incomplete and what additional information is required before the application will be complete. Within fourteen (14) days of receiving the additional information, the staff shall notify the applicant in writing whether the application is now complete or what additional information is necessary. An application shall be deemed to be complete if the staff does not notify the applicant in writing by the deadlines in this section that the application is incomplete. A determination that the application is complete is not a determination that the application is vested.

 4. The determination of completeness does not preclude the staff or the Board from requiring additional information during the review process if more information is needed to evaluate the application according to the criteria in this chapter and in any rules adopted by the Board, or if the proposed work changes. For example, additional information that may be required could include a shadow study or a traffic study when new construction is proposed.

 B. An applicant may make a written request to submit an application for a certificate of approval for a preliminary design of a project, if the applicant waives in writing the deadline for a Board decision on the subsequent design phase or phases of the project and the applicant agrees in writing that the Board decision on the preliminary design is immediately appealable by the applicant or any interested person of record. The staff may reject the request if it appears that approval of a preliminary design would not be an efficient use of staff or Board time and resources, or would not further the goals and objectives of this chapter. To be complete, an application for a certificate of approval for a preliminary design must include the information listed above in subsection A2, subparagraphs a through h, i(1) through i(3), j, m and n. A certificate of approval that is granted for a preliminary design shall be conditioned upon subsequent submittal of the final design and all of the information listed above in subsection A2, and upon Board approval, prior to issuance of permits for work affecting any building or property in the District.

 C. If an application is made to the Director for a permit for which a certificate of approval is required, the Director shall require the applicant to submit an application to the Board for a certificate of approval. Submission of a complete application for a certificate of approval to the Board shall be required before the permit application to the Department of Planning and Development may be determined to be complete. The Director shall continue to process the application, but shall not issue any permit until a certificate of approval has been issued pursuant to this chapter, or the time for filing the notice of denial of a certificate of approval with the Director has expired.

 D. After the Board has commenced proceedings for the consideration of any application for a certificate of approval for a particular alteration or significant change by giving notice of a meeting pursuant to this section or otherwise, no other application for the same or a similar alteration or significant change at the same site may be made until the application is withdrawn or such proceedings and all appeals therefrom have been concluded, except that an application may be made for a certificate of approval for the preliminary design of a project and a later application may be made for a certificate of approval for subsequent design phase or phases of the same project.

 E. A certificate of approval shall be valid for eighteen (18) months from the date of issuance of the Board's decision granting it unless the Board grants an extension in writing; provided however, that certificates of approval for actions subject to permits issued by the Department of Planning and Development shall be valid for the life of the permit, including any extensions granted in writing by the Department of Planning and Development.

 SMC 25.21.110 Board meeting on certificate of approval.

 A. Within thirty (30) days after the filing of an application for a certificate of approval with the Board, the Board shall hold a meeting thereon and shall serve notice of the meeting on the owner and the applicant not less than five (5) days before the date of the meeting.

 B. In reviewing applications or appeals of decisions of the Board, the Board and the Hearing Examiner shall consider: (1) the purposes of this chapter;(2) the criteria specified in Section 25.21.034 ; (3) guidelines promulgated pursuant to this chapter; (4) the properties' historical and architectural or landscape value and significance; (5) the properties' architectural or landscape type and general design; (6) the arrangement, texture, material and color of the building or structure in question, and its appurtenant fixtures, including signs; (7) the relationship of such features to similar features within the Fort Lawton Landmark District; and (8) the position of such buildings, structures or landscape elements in relation to public property and to other buildings, structures and landscape elements.

 SMC 25.21.120 Issuance of Board decision.

 The Board shall consider the recommendation of the Application Review Committee and shall, within forty-five (45) days after the application for a certificate of approval is determined to be complete, issue a written decision either granting, granting with conditions, or denying a certificate of approval and shall mail a copy of the decision to the owner, the applicant and the Director within three (3) working days after such decision. A decision denying a certificate of approval shall contain an explanation of the reasons for the Board's decision and specific findings with respect to this chapter and the adopted guidelines for the District. Notice of the Board's decision shall be provided to any person who, prior to the rendering of the decision, made a written request to receive notice of the decision or submitted written substantive comments on the application.

 SMC 25.21.130 Appeal to Hearing Examiner.

 A. Any interested person of record may appeal to the Hearing Examiner the decision of the Board to grant, grant with conditions, or deny a certificate of approval by serving written notice of appeal upon the Board and by filing such notice and a copy of the Board's decision with the Hearing Examiner within fourteen (14) days after the date the Board's decision is issued.

 B. When the proposed action that is the subject of the certificate of approval is also the subject of one (1) or more related permit applications under review by the Department of Planning and Development, then the appellant must also file notice of the appeal with the Department of Planning and Development, and the appeal of the certificate of approval shall not be heard until all of the time periods for filing administrative appeals on the other permits have expired except that an appeal of a certificate of approval for the preliminary design or for subsequent design phases may proceed immediately according to Section 25.22.080 without being consolidated. If one (1) or more appeals are filed regarding the other permits, then the appeal of the certificate of approval shall be consolidated with them and shall be heard according to the same timelines established for the other appeals, except that appeals to the State Shoreline Hearings Board shall proceed independently according to the timelines set by the state for such appeals, and except that an appeal of a certificate of approval for a preliminary design or for a subsequent design phase may proceed according to Section 25.22.080 without being consolidated. If the related permit decisions would not be appealable, then the appeal of the certificate of approval decision shall proceed immediately after it is filed.

 C. The applicant for the certificate of approval may elect to have the appeal proceed immediately rather than postponed for consolidation with appeals of related permit applications, if the applicant agrees in writing that the Department of Planning and Development may suspend its review of the related permits, and that the time period for review of those permits shall be suspended until the Hearing Examiner issues a decision on the appeal of the certificate of approval.

 D. The Hearing Examiner shall hear and determine the appeal in accordance with the standards and procedures established for appeals to the Hearing Examiner under Seattle Municipal Code Sections 25.12.740 through 25.12.760 of the Landmarks Preservation Ordinance, and as prescribed under Section 25.21.110 B.

 E. The Hearing Examiner shall issue a decision not later than ninety (90) days after the last of the appeals of related permit decisions is filed, or, if the applicant chooses to proceed immediately with the appeal of the certificate of approval, as provided in subsection C, then not later than ninety (90) days from the filing of that appeal.

 The time period to consider and decide the appeal of a certificate of approval shall be exempt from the deadlines for review and decision on both the certificate of approval and any related permit applications.

 F. The Hearing Examiner's decision shall be final. The Hearing Examiner's decision shall be binding upon the Historic Preservation Officer and the Board, as well as all parties of record to the proceeding. Any judicial review must be commenced within twenty-one (21) days of issuance of the Hearing Examiner's decision, as provided by RCW 36.70C.040.

 SMC 25.21.135 Requests for interpretation.

 A. An applicant for a certificate of approval may request an interpretation of the meaning of any part of this chapter as it relates to the requested certificate of approval. An interpretation shall not have any effect on certificates of approval that have already been granted.

 B. An interpretation shall be requested in writing, specify the section of the code to be interpreted, and specify the question to be addressed. Requests shall be submitted to the Historic Preservation Officer.

 C. If the requested interpretation relates to a certificate of approval for which an application has been filed, then the request for an interpretation cannot be made any later than fourteen (14) days after the application for the certificate of approval was submitted. Provided, however, that a request for an interpretation may be sought by the applicant at a later time if the applicant agrees in writing to suspend the time frames for review of the certificate of approval, and the time frames applicable to any related permits that are under review, until the interpretation is issued.

 D. Interpretations shall be made in writing by the Historic Preservation Officer, and shall be issued within twenty-five (25) days of submission of the request. The interpretation decision shall be served on the requesting party, and notice of the decision shall be mailed to parties of record and interested persons of record.

 E. A fee shall be charged for interpretations in the amount provided in the Permit Fee Subtitle of the Seattle Municipal Code, Chapter 22.900C.010, Table C1, and shall be collected by the Department of Neighborhoods.

 F. An interpretation may be appealed by the applicant if the certificate of approval that the interpretation addresses is denied and the applicant is appealing the denial, or if the interpretation relates to conditions placed on the certificate of approval that the applicant is appealing. An appeal of an interpretation shall be filed at the same time as appeal of the related certificate of approval, and shall be consolidated with the appeal of the related certificate of approval. Appeal of the interpretation shall proceed according to the same procedures and time frames provided in Section 25.21.130 for appeal of a certificate of approval, including the provisions for consolidation with appeals of any related permit decisions.

 G. The Hearing Examiner shall give substantial weight to the Historic Preservation Officer's interpretation. The appellant shall have the burden of establishing that the interpretation is erroneous.

 H. The Hearing Examiner may affirm, reverse, or modify the Historic Preservation Officer's interpretation, in whole or in part. The Hearing Examiner may also remand the interpretation to the Historic Preservation Officer for further consideration.

 I. The decision of the Hearing Examiner shall be final. The Hearing Examiner's decision shall be binding upon the Historic Preservation Officer and the Board, as well as all parties of record to the proceeding. Copies of the Hearing Examiner's decision shall be mailed to the Historic Preservation Officer and to all parties of record before the Hearing Examiner. Judicial review must be commenced within twenty-one (21) days of issuance of the Hearing Examiner's decision, as provided by RCW 36.70C.040.
