 ORDINANCE _________________

 AN ORDINANCE relating to energy efficiency and energy conservation, amending Section 22.700.010 of the Seattle Municipal Code; enacting a new Seattle Energy Code by adopting by reference the 2009 Washington State Energy Code, with certain amendments applicable to nonresidential spaces and revisions to administrative and procedural provisions; repealing Sections 2-10 of Ordinance 122530; and providing for a deferred effective date for such repeal and for application of the new Seattle Energy Code to residential spaces.

 WHEREAS, the Washington State Building Code Council has adopted the 2009 Washington Energy Code, has deferred its effective date to October 29, 2010, and has proposed a further deferral of its effective date; NOW, THEREFORE,

 BE IT ORDAINED BY THE CITY OF SEATTLE AS FOLLOWS:

 Section 1. Section 22.700.010 of the Seattle Municipal Code is amended as follows:

 22.700.010 ((~~Adoption of the 2006 Washington State Energy Code and local amendments~~))  Seattle Energy Code .

 A. The ((~~2006~~))  2009 Washington State Energy Code (WAC 51-11), which is filed with the City Clerk in C.F. ((~~308938~~)) 311044 , and the amendments thereto adopted by Council Bill ((~~116033 that incorporate~~)) 116967 , which are  the Seattle Amendments, are hereby adopted and by this reference made a part of this subtitle((~~and constitute the Washington State Energy Code with Seattle amendments~~)). The Seattle Amendments include amendments to Reference Standard 29 and add Reference Standards 35 and 36. The 2009 Washington State Energy Code, with all Seattle Amendments, constitutes the Seattle Energy Code for all purposes other than application to residential spaces.

 B. For purposes of this Section 22.700.010:

 1. Prior to the effective date of the 2009 Washington State Energy Code, "residential spaces" are defined as spaces within the definition of "Group R" occupancy in Chapter 3 of the 2006 Seattle Building Code, as adopted by Ordinance 122528, or within the exception in Section 101.2 of that code, and

 2. effective upon the date when the 2009 Washington State Energy Code takes effect, "residential spaces" are defined as set forth in Chapter 2 of the 2009 Washington State Energy Code under "RESIDENTIAL".

 C. Effective upon the date when the 2009 Washington State Energy Code takes effect, the 2009 Washington State Energy Code, with the Seattle Amendments only to Chapter 1 and to Sections 1144 and 1162 of Chapter 11, and the provisions for procedure, administration and enforcement described in Section 1105 of the Seattle Amendments, shall constitute the Seattle Energy Code for residential spaces, to the extent that the provisions thereof apply to residential spaces. Until the effective date of the 2009 Washington State Energy Code, the 2006 Washington State Energy Code, as filed in C.F. 308938, and the amendments thereto adopted by Ordinance 122530, constitute the Seattle Energy Code for residential spaces, except as provided in Section 101.1.2 of the Seattle Amendments regarding procedure, administration and enforcement provisions.

 D. It is the City's intent that the Seattle Energy Code constitute part of a local building code, and that any provisions that would be superseded by federal standards but for the application of 42 USC Section 6316(b)(2)(B) or of any other exception to federal preemption shall be applicable to the full extent authorized by any such exception. Any other provision notwithstanding, any requirement of the Seattle Energy Code shall be applicable at any time only to the maximum extent that its application is not prohibited by United States law as then in effect. If any provision of the Seattle Amendments shall be determined to be invalid or unenforceable for any reason, and if the such invalidity or unenforceability would otherwise result in application of any standard below that required by the Washington State Energy Code as then in effect, then the standard of the Washington State Energy Code as then in effect shall apply unless such application is prohibited by applicable federal law.

 Section 2. The following sections or subsections of Chapter 1 of the 2009 Washington State Energy Code are amended, and new subsections are added, as follows:

 SECTION 101 --- SCOPE AND GENERAL REQUIREMENTS

 101.1 Title and Applicability

 101.1.1 Title :  This Code, including provisions of the 2009 Washington Energy Code as they apply without Seattle Amendments, may be referred to as the "Seattle Energy Code" or the "2009 Seattle Energy Code". References herein to "this Code" mean the entire Seattle Energy Code or the provisions thereof that are applicable to the type of structure or space involved, as the context may require.

 Chapters 1 through 10 of this Code , as they apply to single-family residential spaces, shall be known as the "((~~Washington State~~))  Seattle Single-Family Residential Energy Code" and may be cited as such . Any reference to the "Seattle Energy Code" in the Seattle Municipal Code or any Seattle ordinance, to the extent applicable to those spaces, shall include the Seattle Single-Family Residential Energy Code. ((~~; and will be referred to herein as "this Code."~~))

 101.1.2 Applicability to Single-Family Residential Spaces: Until the effective date of the 2009 Washington State Energy Code, the 2006 Washington State Energy Code, as filed in Seattle City Clerk's File 308938, and the amendments thereto adopted by Ordinance 122530, constitute the Seattle Energy Code for single-family residential spaces. Effective upon the date when the 2009 Washington State Energy Code takes effect, Chapters 1 through 10 of the 2009 Washington State Energy Code, with the Seattle Amendments only to Chapter 1, constitute the Seattle Energy Code for single-family residential spaces.

 EXCEPTION: Sections 1133, 1140, 1141.1, 1141.2, 1144, and 1162 of Chapter 11 of this Code, which relate to procedure, administration and enforcement, including Seattle Amendments to those sections, and the procedural requirements in all chapters, apply to all spaces and occupancies both before and after effectiveness of the 2009 Washington State Energy Code.

 101.2 Purpose and Intent: The purpose of  the Seattle Single-Family Residential Energy Code ((~~this Code~~)) is to provide minimum standards for new or altered buildings and structures or portions thereof to achieve efficient use and conservation of energy.

 The purpose of  the Seattle Single-Family Residential Energy Code ((~~this Code~~)) is not to create or otherwise establish or designate any particular class or group of persons who will or should be especially protected or benefited by  its terms ((~~the terms of this Code~~)). It is intended that these provisions provide flexibility to permit the use of innovative approaches and techniques to achieve efficient use and conservation of energy. These provisions are structured to permit compliance with the intent of  the Seattle Single-Family Residential Energy Code ((~~this Code~~)) by any one of the following three paths of design:

 1. A systems analysis approach for the entire building and its energy-using sub-systems which may utilize renewable energy sources; Chapters 4 and 9.

 2. A component performance approach for various building elements and mechanical systems and components; Chapters 5 and 9.

 3. A prescriptive requirements approach; Chapters 6 and 9.

 Compliance with any one of these approaches meets the intent of  the Seattle Single-Family Residential Energy Code ((~~this Code~~)).  The Seattle Single-Family Residential Energy Code ((~~This Code~~)) is not intended to abridge any safety or health requirements required under any other applicable codes or ordinances. The provisions of  the Seattle Single-Family Residential Energy Code ((~~this Code~~)) do not consider the efficiency of various energy forms as they are delivered to the building envelope. A determination of delivered energy efficiencies in conjunction with  the Seattle Single-Family Residential Energy Code ((~~this Code~~)) will provide the most efficient use of available energy in new building construction.

 101.3 Scope:  The Seattle Single-Family Residential Energy Code ((~~This Code~~)) sets forth , among other things,  minimum requirements for the design of new buildings and structures that provide facilities or shelter for residential occupancies by regulating their exterior envelopes and the selection of their mechanical systems, domestic water systems, electrical distribution and illuminating systems, and equipment for efficient use and conservation of energy. Buildings  that are subject to the Seattle Single-Family Residential Energy Code shall be designed to comply with the requirements of((~~either~~)) Chapter 4, 5 or 6 of this Code and the additional energy efficiency requirements included in Chapter 9 of this Code.

 Spaces within the scope of Section R101.2 of the ((~~International~~)) Seattle  Residential Code shall comply with Chapters 1 through 10 of this Code. All other spaces, including other Group R Occupancies, shall comply with Chapters 11 through  16 ((~~20~~)) of this Code as specified in Section 1105 . Chapter 2 (Definitions),  Chapter 3 (Design Conditions), Chapter 7 (Standards) and Chapter 10 (Default heat loss coefficients) are applicable to all building types.

 ***

 105.2.1 Required Inspections: The building official, upon notification, shall make the following inspection in addition to those inspections required in ((~~Section 109.3 of the International~~)) the Seattle  Building Code or Seattle Residential Code :

 1. Wall Insulation Inspection: To be made after all wall insulation and air vapor retarder sheet or film materials are in place, but before any wall covering is placed.

 ***

 SECTION 106 --- VIOLATIONS AND PENALTIES

 It shall be unlawful for any person, firm, or corporation to erect or construct any building, or remodel or rehabilitate any existing building or structure in the ((~~state~~)) city of Seattle , or allow the same to be done, contrary to or in violation of any of the provisions of this Code. Other violations are set forth in Section 1144 of this Code. Provisions for notices, enforcement proceedings and penalties specified in Section 103 of the Seattle Building Code apply to violations of this Code, as set forth in Section 1144 of this Code.

 ***

 SECTION 107 --- LIABILITY

 Nothing contained in this Code is intended to be nor shall be construed to create or form the basis for any liability on the part of ((~~any city or county~~)) the City of Seattle  or its officers, employees or agents for any injury or damage resulting from the failure of a building to conform to the provisions of this Code.

 ***

 SECTION 108 --- CONFLICTS WITH OTHER CODES

 In addition to the requirements of this Code, all occupancies shall conform to the provisions included in the  Seattle Building Code or Seattle Residential Code, as applicable, and other applicable codes ((~~State Building Code (Chapter 19.27 RCW)~~)). In case of conflicts among Codes enumerated in RCW 19.27.031 subsections (1), (2), (3) and (4) and this Code, an earlier named Code shall govern over those following. In the case of conflict between the duct sealing and insulation requirements of this Code and the duct insulation requirements of Sections 603 and 604 of the ((~~State~~)) Seattle  Mechanical Code ((~~(Chapter 51-52 WAC)~~)), the duct insulation requirements of this  Code ((~~code, or where applicable, a local jurisdiction's energy code~~)) shall govern.

 Where, in any specific case, different sections of this Code specify different materials, methods of construction or other requirements, the most restrictive shall govern. Where there is a conflict between a general requirement and a specific requirement, the specific requirement shall be applicable. ((~~Wherever in this Code reference is made to the appendix, the provisions in the appendix shall not apply unless specifically adopted.~~))

 ***

 Section 3. The following subsections of Section 201 of Chapter 2 of the 2009 Washington State Energy Code are amended, and new subsections are added to that Section, as follows:

 SECTION 201 -- GENERAL DEFINITIONS

 ***

 ADDITION: See the ((~~Washington State~~)) Seattle  Building Code.

 ***

 AHRI STANDARD 1160: AHRI's Standard 1160, Performance Rating of Heat Pump Pool Heaters, 2008.

 ***

 AMCA: Air Movement and Control Association.

 AMCA STANDARD 500: AMCA's Standard 500, Laboratory Methods of Testing Dampers for Rating, 1997.

 ***

 ASHRAE STANDARD 127: ASHRAE's Standard 127, Method of Testing for Rating Computer and Data Processing Room Unitary Air Conditioners, 2007.

 ***

 BUILDING, EXISTING:  An existing structure, as defined in the Seattle Building Code.  ( See  Existing Structure in the ((~~Washington State~~)) Seattle  Building Code. )

 BUILDING ENTRANCE: Any doorway, set of doors (including elevator doors such as in parking garages) , turnstile, vestibule, or other form of portal that is ordinarily used to gain access to the building by its users and occupants. Where buildings have separate one-way doors to enter and to leave, this also includes any doors ordinarily used to leave the building.

 ***

 BUILDING OFFICIAL: The ((~~official authorized to act in behalf of a jurisdiction code enforcement agency or its~~)) Director of the Seattle Department of Planning and Development, or his or her authorized representative.

 ***

 COMPUTER ROOM: a room whose primary function is to house electronic equipment for the processing and storage of electronic data and that has a design electronic data equipment power density exceeding 20 watts/ft2 of conditioned floor area (215 watts/m2).

 ***

 CONTINUOUS INSULATION (c.i.): Insulation that is continuous across all structural members without thermal bridges other than fasteners  (i.e. screws and nails) and service openings. It is installed on the interior or exterior or is integral to any opaque surface of the building envelope. For the purposes of this definition of continuous insulation, only screws and nails are considered fasteners. Insulation installed between metal studs, z-girts, z-channels, shelf angles, or insulation with penetrations by brick ties and offset brackets, or any other similar framing is not considered continuous insulation, regardless of whether the metal is continuous or occasionally discontinuous or has thermal break material. (See Section 1332 for determination of U-factors for assemblies that include metal other than screws and nails.)

 Informative Note: Even small clips degrade the performance of insulation. For mass walls, Table 13-1 contains a prescriptive compliance option for mass walls with 1-inch clips. This corresponds with the category of "1 in Metal Clips at 24 in. on center horizontally and 16 in. vertically" in Table 10-5B(3), Default U-factor for Concrete and Masonry. However, note that this is not considered continuous insulation. There is a separate listing in Table 10-5B(3) for insulation that qualifies as continuous insulation.

 Metal studs, z-girts or any other repetitive continuous metal framing can decrease the effective R-value of insulation by more than 50%. However, occasional continuous metal framing members such as shelf angles are also significant thermal bridges around the insulation. Discontinuous metal elements, such as stand-off brackets are better, but still are a thermal bridging element. Calculations on a stand-off system utilizing 6-inch brackets showed that the brackets mounted at 24 inches on center vertically and 16 inches on center horizontally decreased the effective R-value of the assembly by 25% and the brackets mounted at 48 inches on center vertically and 16 inches on center horizontally decreased the effective R- value of the assembly by 14%. Even isolated discontinuous metal elements such as brick ties have a thermal impact that is too large to be ignored.

 ***

 DAYLIGHTED ZONE:

 a. Under  skylights ((~~overhead glazing~~)): the area under  a skylight ((~~overhead glazing~~)) whose horizontal dimension, in each direction, is equal to the  skylight's ((~~overhead glazing~~)) dimension in that direction plus either 70 percent of the floor to ceiling height or the dimension to a ceiling height opaque partition or to a partition which is more than 50% opaque , or one-half the distance to  an adjacent  skylight ((~~overhead~~)) or vertical  fenestration ((~~glazing~~)), whichever is least.

 b. At vertical  fenestration ((~~glazing~~)): the area adjacent to vertical  fenestration ((~~glazing~~)) which receives daylighting from the glazing. For purposes of this definition and unless more detailed daylighting analysis is provided, the primary daylighted zone depth extends into the space a distance equal to the window head height and the secondary daylighted zone extends from the edge of the primary zone to a distance equal to two times the window head height, or to the nearest ceiling height opaque partition or to a partition which is more than 50% opaque , whichever is  least ((~~less~~)). The daylighting zone width is assumed to be the width of the window plus either two feet on each side ( or the  lesser distance to an opaque partition) or one-half the distance to adjacent  skylights ((~~overhead~~)) or vertical  fenestration ((~~glazing~~)), whichever is least.

 c. In parking garages: the area within 20 feet of any portion of a perimeter wall that has a net opening to wall ratio of at least 40% and no exterior obstructions within 20 feet.

 ***

 DOMESTIC WATER SYSTEM: Supply of hot water and cold water for domestic ,  ((~~or~~)) commercial , or industrial  purposes , including commercial and industrial processes,  other than comfort heating and cooling.

 Informative Note: As indicated in Section 1120, the Energy Code applies to industrial facilities, as well as commercial and industrial processes. Thus, the domestic water requirements apply to industrial facilities, as well as systems and equipment used in commercial and industrial processes.

 ***

 DPD: the Seattle Department of Planning and Development and any successor department responsible for administration of this Code.

 DWELLING UNIT: See the ((~~Washington State~~)) Seattle  Building Code.

 ***

 GEOTHERMAL ENERGY: heat extracted from the Earth's interior and used to produce electricity or mechanical power or provide thermal energy for heating buildings, water, or processes. Geothermal energy does not include systems that use energy independent of the geothermal source to raise the temperature of the extracted heat, such as heat pumps.

 ***

 GLAZING:  For residential spaces, ((~~All~~)) all  areas, including the frames, in the shell of a conditioned space that let in natural light including windows, clerestories, skylights, sliding or swinging glass doors and glass block walls. For other spaces, that portion of the fenestration that lets in natural light. (See Fenestration.)

 Informative Note: The terminology used for single-family residential in Chapters 1-10 differs from that used for other spaces in Chapters 2 and 10-16. For single-family residential, the term "glazing" is used to apply to the overall product including the frame. However, for other spaces (nonresidential and multifamily residential), the term "fenestration" is used for the overall product including the frame, and "glazing" means only the portion of the product that lets in natural light.

 ***

 GUEST ROOM: See the ((~~Washington State~~)) Seattle  Building Code.

 ***

 INDIRECTLY CONDITIONED SPACE: an enclosed space within a building that is not a heated or cooled space, whose area weighted heat transfer coefficient to heated or cooled spaces exceeds that to the outdoors or to unconditioned spaces; or through which air from heated or cooled spaces is transferred at a rate exceeding three air changes per hour. Enclosed corridors between conditioned spaces shall be considered as indirectly conditioned space.  Unless demonstrated otherwise, all portions of elevator shafts and stair enclosures located in the interior of the building are considered indirectly conditioned space, including those portions of elevator shafts and stair enclosures that extend above the roof and those portions that extend down below the floor into the parking garage. (See  Conditioned Space, Heated Space, Cooled Space ,  and Unconditioned Space.)

 Informative Note: For elevator shafts and stair enclosures, unless the space they enclose is demonstrated not to be conditioned space, the walls and roofs of elevator shafts and stair enclosures that extend above the roof are subject to the building envelope requirements for conditioned space, and the walls of elevator shafts and stair enclosures that extend down below the floor into the parking garage are subject to the building envelope requirements for conditioned space.

 2. Standard RS-1, listed in Chapter 7, where the metal framing is bonded on one or both sides to a metal skin or covering.

 3. The zone method as provided in Chapter 27 of Standard RS-1, listed in Chapter 7.

 4. Results of parallel path correction factors for effective framing/cavity R-values as provided in Table 10-5A: Effective R-Values for Metal Framing and Cavity Only for metal stud walls and roof/ceilings.

 Informative Note: Effective framing/cavity R-values are provided in Table 10-5A(2).

 ***

 502.1.4.1 General: All insulating materials shall comply with Sections 2603 and/or 719 of the ((~~International~~)) Seattle  Building Code. Substantial contact of the insulation with the surface being insulated is required. All insulation materials shall be installed according to the manufacturer's instructions to achieve proper densities and maintain uniform R-values and shall be installed in a manner which will permit inspection of the manufacturer's R-value identification mark. To the maximum extent possible, insulation shall extend over the full component area to the intended R-value.

 The thickness of roof/ceiling insulation that is either blown in or spray-applied shall be identified by inches of thickness, density and R-value markers installed at least one for every 300 square feet (28 m2) through the attic and/or ceiling space. In attics, the markers shall be affixed to the trusses or joists and marked with the minimum initial installed thickness with numbers a minimum 1.0 inch (25 mm) in height. Each marker shall face the attic access. The thickness of installed attic insulation shall meet or exceed the minimum initial installed thickness shown by the marker.

 502.1.4.2 Insulation Materials: All insulation materials including facings such as vapor barriers or breather papers installed within floor/ceiling assemblies, roof/ceiling assemblies, walls, crawl spaces, or attics shall have a flame spread rating of less than 25 and a smoke density not to exceed 450 when tested in accordance with ASTM E84-01.

 1005.3 Component Description: Default coefficients for the following types of walls are listed: Single-stud walls, strap walls, double-stud walls, log walls, stress-skin panels, metal stud walls, and metal building walls.

 Single-Stud Wall, Tables 10-5(1) through 10-5(8): Assumes either 2x4 or 2x6 studs framed on sixteen or twenty-four inch centers. Headers are solid for 2x4 walls and double 2x for 2x6 walls, with either dead-air or rigid-board insulation in the remaining space.

 Strap Wall, Table 10-5(9): Assumes 2x6 studs framed on sixteen or twenty-four inch centers. 2x3 or 2x4 strapping is run horizontally along the interior surface of the wall to provide additional space for insulation.

 Double-Stud Wall, Tables 10-5(10) and 10-5(11): Assumes an exterior structural wall and a separate interior, nonstructural wall. Insulation is placed in both wall cavities and in the space between the 2 walls. Stud spacing is assumed to be on 24 inch centers for both walls.

 Log Wall, Table 10-5(12).

 Stress-Skin Panel, Table 10-5(13).

 Metal Stud Wall, Overall Assembly U-Factors, Table 10-5A(1): Assumes metal studs spaced on 16- or 24-inch centers with insulation installed to fill wall cavities. Continuous rigid board insulation is applied without creating uninsulated voids in the wall assembly.

 Metal Stud Wall, Effective R-Values for Metal Framing and Cavity Only, Table 10-5A(2): These values may be used for the metal-framing/cavity layers in walls with metal studs spaced on 16- or 24-inch centers with insulation installed to fill wall cavities in lieu of using the zone method provided in Chapter 25 of Standard RS-1 listed in Chapter 7.

 Metal Building Wall, Table 10-5A(3): A wall whose structure consists of metal spanning panels supported by steel structural members (does not include spandrel glass or metal panels in curtain wall systems).  These values may be used for assemblies where the average girt spacing is at least 52 in.  The first nominal R-value is for insulation compressed between metal wall panels and the steel structure. ((~~For double-layer installations, the second rated R-value of insulation is for insulation installed from the inside, covering the girts. For continuous insulation (e.g., insulation boards) it is assumed that the insulation boards are~~))  For assemblies with continuous insulation, the continuous insulation is installed on the  outside or inside of the girts , uncompressed  and uninterrupted by the framing members. Insulation exposed to the conditioned space ,  ((or)) including a  semi-heated space ,  shall have a facing, and all insulation seams shall be continuously sealed ((~~to provide a continuous air barrier~~)). U-factors for metal building wall assemblies with average girt spacing less than 52 in. shall be determined in accordance with Section A9.2 of RS-9.

</table> Notes for Default Table 10-5B(3)

 1. It is acceptable to use the U-factors in Table 10- 5B(3) for all concrete and masonry walls, provided that the grouting is equal to or less than that specified. -- For ungrouted walls, use the partially-grouted column. -- For metal studs and z-furring, use the continuous-metal- framing category. -- For discontinuous metal clips 1 inch square or smaller, use the metal-clip category. -- For insulation that is attached without any framing members (e.g. glued), use the continuous-insulation-uninterrupted-by- framing category. Continuous insulation may be installed on the interior or exterior of masonry walls, or between stand-alone walls in multi-layer masonry walls, or on the interior or exterior of the concrete.

 2. For Table 10-5B(3), the U-factor includes R-0.17 for exterior air film and R-0.68 for interior air film - vertical surfaces. For insulated walls, the U-factor also includes R- 0.45 for 0.5 in. gypsum board. U-factors are provided for the following configurations:

 (a) Concrete wall: 8-in. normal weight concrete wall with a density of 145 lb/ft3.

 (b) Solid grouted concrete block wall: 8-in. medium weight ASTM C90 concrete block with a density of 115 lb/ft3 and solid grouted cores.

 (c) Partially grouted concrete block wall: 8-in. medium weight ASTM C90 concrete block with a density of 115 lb/ft3 having reinforcing steel every 32 in. vertically and every 48 in. horizontally, with cores grouted in those areas only. Other cores are filled with insulating material only if there is no other insulation.

 3. For walls with insulation contained in a framing layer, the U-factors in Table 10-5B(3) assume contact (and thermal bridging) between the mass wall and other framing. For wall assemblies with multiple layers where the wood or metal framing layer does not contact the concrete or masonry layer (i.e. walls with an airspace between the stud wall layer and the mass wall layer), it is acceptable to use the appropriate wood or metal frame wall default U-factors in Tables 10-5 or 10-5A. Note, it is acceptable to use this approach where the insulation extends beyond the framing and is in contact with the mass wall layer (e.g. a nominal four-inch metal stud containing insulation that is nominally six inches thick and therefore extends two inches beyond the back of the metal stud).

 4. Except for wall assemblies qualifying for note 3, if not taken from Table 10-5B(3), mass wall U-factors shall be determined in accordance with RS-9, Appendix A, Section A3.1 and Tables A3.1A to A3.1D, or Section A9.4. If not taken from Table 10-9, heat capacity for mass walls shall be taken from RS-9, Appendix A, Table A3.1B or A3.1C.

 5. See Section 1332 for determination of U-factors for assemblies that include metal other than screws and nails.

 1007.2 Component Description: The ((~~four~~)) types of ceilings are characterized as follows:

 Ceilings Below a Vented Attic: Attic insulation is assumed to be blown-in, loose-fill fiberglass with a K-value of 2.6 hùft2ù degrees F/Btu per inch. Full bag count for specified R-value is assumed in all cases. Ceiling dimensions for flat ceiling calculations are forty-five by thirty feet, with a gabled roof having a 4/12 pitch. The attic is assumed to vent naturally at the rate of three air changes per hour through soffit and ridge vents. A void fraction of 0.002 is assumed for all attics with insulation baffles. Standard-framed, unbaffled attics assume a void fraction of 0.008.

 Attic framing is either standard or advanced. Standard framing assumes tapering of insulation depth around the perimeter with resultant decrease in thermal resistance. An increased R-value is assumed in the center of the ceiling due to the effect of piling leftover insulation. Advanced framing assumes full and even depth of insulation extending to the outside edge of exterior walls. Advanced framing does not change from the default value.

 U-factors for flat ceilings below vented attics with standard framing may be modified with the following table:

</table> Vented scissors truss attics assume a ceiling pitch of 2/12 with a roof pitch of either 4/12 or 5/12. Unbaffled standard framed scissors truss attics are assumed to have a void fraction of 0.016.

 Vaulted Ceilings: Insulation is assumed to be fiberglass batts installed in roof joist cavities. In the vented case, at least 1.5-inches between the top of the batts and the underside of the roof sheathing is left open for ventilation in each cavity. A ventilation rate of 3.0 air changes per hour is assumed. In the unvented or dense pack case, the ceiling cavity is assumed to be fully packed with insulation, leaving no space for ventilation.

 EXCEPTION: Where spray polyurethane foam meets the requirements of Section 502.1.6.3 or 1313.2, the cavity shall be filled to the depth to achieve R-value requirements.

 Roof Decks: Rigid insulation is applied to the top of roof decking with no space left for ventilation. Roofing materials are attached directly on top of the insulation. Framing members are often left exposed on the interior side.

 Metal Truss Framing: Overall system tested values for the roof/ceiling Uo for metal framed truss assemblies from approved laboratories shall be used, when such data is acceptable to the building official.

 Alternatively, the Uo for roof/ceiling assemblies using metal truss framing may be obtained from Tables 10-7A, 10-7B, 10-7C, 10-7D and 10-7E.

 Steel Truss Framed Ceiling, Table 10-7A.

 Steel Truss Framed Ceiling with R-5 Sheathing, Table 10-7C.

 Steel Truss Framed Ceiling with R-10 Sheathing, Table 10-7D.

 Steel Truss Framed Ceiling with R-15 Sheathing, Table 10-7E.

 Metal Building Roof, Table 10-7F: The base assembly is a roof where the insulation is compressed when installed beneath metal roof panels attached to the steel structure (purlins). Additional assemblies include continuous insulation, uncompressed and uninterrupted by

 framing.  Insulation exposed to a conditioned space shall have a facing, and all insulation seams shall be continuously sealed.

 Single Layer. The rated R-value of insulation is for insulation installed perpendicular to and draped over purlins and then compressed when the metal roof panels are attached. A minimum R-3 (R-0.5) thermal spacer block between the purlins and the metal roof panels is required, unless compliance is shown by the overall assembly U-factor.

 Double Layer. The first rated R-value of insulation is for insulation installed perpendicular to and draped over purlins. The second rated R-value of insulation is for unfaced insulation installed above the first layer and parallel to the purlins and then compressed when the metal roof panels are attached. A minimum R-3 (R-0.5) thermal spacer block between the purlins and the metal roof panels is required, unless compliance is shown by the overall assembly U-factor.

 Continuous Insulation.  For assemblies with continuous insulation, the continuous insulation is installed above or below the purlins, uncompressed and uninterrupted by framing members.  ((~~For continuous insulation (e.g., insulation boards or blankets), it is assumed that the insulation is installed below the purlins and is uninterrupted by framing members. Insulation exposed to the conditioned space or semiheated space shall have a facing, and all insulation seams shall be continuously sealed to provide a continuous air barrier.~~))

 Liner System (Ls). A continuous membrane is installed below the purlins and uninterrupted by framing members. Uncompressed, unfaced insulation rests on top of the membrane between the purlins. For multilayer installations, the last rated R-value of insulation is for unfaced insulation draped over purlins and then compressed when the metal roof panels are attached. A minimum R-3 (R-0.5) thermal spacer block between the purlins and the metal roof panels is required, unless compliance is shown by the overall assembly U-factor.

 Filled Cavity. ((~~The first rated R-value of insulation is for faced insulation installed parallel to the purlins. The second rated R-value of insulation is for unfaced insulation installed above the first layer, parallel to and between the purlins and compressed when the metal roof panels are attached. The facer of the first layer of insulation is of sufficient width to be continuously sealed to the top flange of the purlins and to accommodate the full thickness of the second layer of insulation. A supporting structure retains the bottom of the first layer at the prescribed depth required for the full thickness of the second layer of insulation being installed above it.~~))  The first rated R-value of insulation represents faced or unfaced insulation installed between the purlins. The second rated R-value of insulation represents unfaced insulation installed above the first layer, perpendicular to the purlins and compressed where the metal roof panels are attached. A supporting structure retains the bottom of the first layer at the prescribed depth required for the full thickness of insulation.  A minimum R-5 (R-0.9) thermal spacer block between the purlins and the metal roof panels is required, unless compliance is shown by the overall assembly U-factor.

 U-factors for Metal Building Roofs. U-factors for metal building roofs shall be taken from Table 10-7F, provided the average purlin spacing is at least 52 in. and the R-value of the thermal spacer block is greater than or equal to the thermal spacer block R-value indicated in Table 10-7F for the assembly. It is not acceptable to use the U-factors in Table 10-7F if

 additional insulated sheathing is not continuous.  U- factors for metal building roof assemblies with average purlin spacing less than 52 in. shall be determined in accordance with Section A9.2 of RS-9.

 Roofs with Insulation Entirely Above Deck (uninterrupted by framing), Table 10-7G: The base assembly is continuous insulation over a structural deck. Added insulation is continuous and uninterrupted by framing. For the insulation, the first column lists the R-value for continuous insulation with a uniform thickness; the second column lists the comparable area-weighted average R-value for continuous insulation provided that the insulation thickness is never less than R-5 (except at roof drains) and that the slope is no greater than 1/4 inch per foot.

 1009.1 General: Tables 10-9 and 10-10 list default mass values for concrete masonry construction for residential . Calculations are based on standard ASHRAE values for heat-storage capacity as listed in Standard RS-1, Chapter 26. For heat capacity values for brick, concrete, and concrete masonry materials used in other projects, see Table 10-B.

 Thermal capacity of furniture is ignored, as is heat storage beyond the first four inches of mass thickness. All mass is assumed to be in direct contact with the conditioned space. Concrete separated from the heated volume by other materials must multiply the listed concrete mass value by the result of the following formula:

 Ln(R-value) x ( -.221) .+ 0.5

 Where:

 Ln = Natural log

 R-value = R-value of material covering concrete

 Note: All default values for covered concrete slabs have been adjusted according to this procedure.

 Section 10. The following sections or subsections of Chapter 11 of the 2009 Washington State Energy Code are amended, and new sections are added to that Chapter, as follows:

 SECTION 1100 --- TITLE

 Chapters 11 through  16 ((~~20~~)) of this Code shall be known as the "((~~Washington State~~))  Seattle Nonresidential  and Multifamily Residential Energy Code" and may be cited as such . Any reference to the "Seattle Energy Code" in the Seattle Municipal Code or any Seattle ordinance, to the extent applicable to those spaces, shall include the Seattle Nonresidential  and Multifamily Residential Energy Code. ((~~; and will be referred to herein as "this Code."~~))

 SECTION 1105 --- APPLICABILITY TO MULTIFAMILY RESIDENTIAL SPACES

 Until the effective date of the 2009 Washington State Energy Code, the 2006 Washington State Energy Code, as filed in Seattle City Clerk's File 308938, and the amendments thereto adopted by Ordinance 122530, constitute the Seattle Energy Code for multifamily residential spaces. Effective upon the date when the 2009 Washington State Energy Code takes effect, the 2009 Washington State Energy Code, with the Seattle Amendments only to Chapter 1, constitutes the Seattle Energy Code for multifamily residential spaces.

 EXCEPTION: Sections 1133, 1140, 1141.1, 1141.2, 1144, and 1162 of Chapter 11 of this Code, which relate to procedure, administration and enforcement, including Seattle Amendments to those sections, and the procedural requirements in all chapters, apply to all spaces and occupancies both before and after effectiveness of the 2009 Washington State Energy Code.

 For purposes of this Section: (1) Prior to the effective date of the 2009 Washington State Energy Code, "multifamily residential spaces" are defined as spaces within the definition of "Group R" occupancy in Chapter 3 of the 2006 Seattle Building Code and not falling within the scope of Section 101.2 of the 2006 Seattle Residential Code, and (2) effective upon the date when the 2009 Washington State Energy Code takes effect, "multifamily residential spaces" are defined as set forth in Chapter 2 of this Code under "RESIDENTIAL".

 Informative Note: Prior to the effective date of the 2009 Washington State Energy Code no spaces in Group I occupancy are classified as "residential," therefore all Seattle Amendments to sections relevant to those spaces apply to all such spaces.

 SECTION 1110 --- PURPOSE AND INTENT

 The purpose of this Code is to provide minimum standards for new or altered buildings and structures or portions thereof , including systems and equipment used for commercial and industrial processes contained therein,  to achieve efficient use and conservation of energy. It is intended that these provisions provide flexibility to permit the use of innovative approaches and techniques to achieve efficient use and conservation of energy.

 The purpose of this Code is not to create or otherwise establish or designate any particular class or group of persons who will or should be especially protected or benefited by the terms of this Code. This Code is not intended to abridge any safety or health requirements required under any other applicable codes or ordinances.

 The provisions of this Code do not consider the efficiency of various energy forms as they are delivered to the building envelope.

 Informative Note: As indicated in Section 1120, the Energy Code applies to industrial facilities, as well as commercial and industrial processes. Thus, the purpose and the intent is that requirements apply to industrial facilities, as well as systems and equipment used in commercial and industrial processes.

 SECTION 1120 --- SCOPE

 This Code sets forth minimum requirements for the design and commissioning of new or altered buildings and structures or portions thereof that provide facilities or shelter for public assembly, educational, business, mercantile, institutional, storage, factory, industrial, and multifamily residential occupancies by regulating their exterior envelopes and the selection of their mechanical systems, domestic water systems, electrical distribution and illuminating systems, and equipment for efficient use and conservation of energy , including systems and equipment used for commercial and industrial processes contained therein .

 EXCEPTION: The provisions of this code do not apply to temporary growing structures used solely for the commercial production of horticultural plants including ornamental plants, flowers, vegetables, and fruits. ?Temporary growing structure means a structure that has the sides and roof covered with polyethylene, polyvinyl, or similar flexible synthetic material and is used to provide plants with either frost protection or increased heat retention. A temporary growing structure is not considered a building for purposes of this Code.

 ***

 1132.1 Building Envelope: Alterations or repairs shall comply with  Chapter 13, including the nominal R-values and ((~~glazing~~)) fenestration requirements in Table 13-1 or 13-2.

 EXCEPTIONS:

 Where mechanical cooling is added to a space that was not previously cooled, the mechanical cooling system shall comply with Sections 1413 and either 1423 or 1433.

 EXCEPTIONS: These exceptions only apply to situations where mechanical cooling is added to a space that was not previously cooled.

 1. Water-cooled refrigeration equipment provided with a water economizer meeting the requirements of Section 1413 need not comply with 1423 or 1433. This exception shall not be used for RS-29 analysis.

 2. Alternate designs that are not in full compliance with this Code may be approved when the building official determines that existing building or occupancy constraints make full compliance impractical or where full compliance would be economically impractical.

 Alterations to existing mechanical cooling systems shall not decrease economizer capacity unless the system complies with Sections 1413 and either 1423 or 1433. In addition, for existing mechanical cooling systems that do not comply with Sections 1413 and either 1423 or 1433, including both the individual unit size limits and the total building capacity limits on units without economizer, other alterations shall comply with Table 11-1.

 When space cooling equipment is replaced, controls shall be installed to provide for integrated operation with economizer in accordance with Section 1413.3.

 Existing equipment currently in use may be relocated within the same floor or same tenant space if removed and reinstalled within the same permit.

 In no case shall the energy efficiency of the building be decreased.

 1132.3 Lighting and Motors: Where the use in a space changes from one use in Table 15-1 to another use in Table 15-1, the installed lighting wattage shall comply with Section 1521 or 1531.

 Other tenant improvements, alterations or repairs where ((~~60~~))  20  percent or more of the fixtures , or of the lamps plus ballasts alone,  in a space enclosed by walls or ceiling-height partitions are ((~~new~~))  altered, added, or replaced  shall comply with Sections 1531 and 1532. (Where this threshold is triggered, the areas of the affected spaces may be combined for lighting code compliance calculations.) Where less than ((~~60~~))  20  percent of the fixtures in a space enclosed by walls or ceiling-height partitions are new, the installed lighting wattage shall be maintained or reduced. Where ((~~60~~))  20  percent or more of the lighting fixtures in a suspended ceiling are new, and the existing insulation is on the suspended ceiling, the roof/ceiling assembly shall be insulated according to the provisions of Chapter 13, Section 1311.2.

 Any new lighting control devices shall comply with the requirements of Section 1513.

 Where new wiring is being installed to serve added fixtures and/or fixtures are being relocated to a new circuit, controls shall comply with Sections 1513.1 through 1513.5 and, as applicable, 1513.8. In addition, office areas less than 300 ft2 enclosed by walls or ceiling-height partitions, and all meeting and conference rooms, and all school classrooms, shall be equipped with occupancy sensors that comply with Section 1513.6 and 1513.8. Where a new lighting panel (or a moved lighting panel) with all new raceway and conductor wiring from the panel to the fixtures is being installed, controls shall also comply with the other requirements in Sections 1513.6 through 1513.8.

 Where new walls or ceiling-height partitions are added to an existing space and create a new enclosed space, but the lighting fixtures are not being changed, other than being relocated, the new enclosed space shall have controls that comply with Sections 1513.1 through 1513.2, 1513.4, and 1513.6 through 1513.8.

 Those motors which are altered or replaced shall comply with Section 1511.

 In no case shall the energy efficiency of the building be decreased.

 1133 Change of occupancy or use or space conditioning . Changes of occupancy or use  or space conditioning shall comply with the following requirements:

 a. Any unconditioned space that is altered to become semi-heated, cooled, or fully heated, or any semi-heated space that is altered to become cooled or fully heated space shall be required to be brought into full compliance with this Code. Existing warehouses and repair shops are considered unconditioned space unless they are indicated as conditioned space in DPD records or they were built after 1980 and they comply with the building envelope requirements for conditioned space in effect at the time of construction. (See the Seattle Mechanical Code for requirements for combustion appliances.)

 b. Any nonresidential space which is converted to multifamily residential space shall be brought into full compliance with this Code.

 c. Any multifamily residential space which is converted to nonresidential space shall be required to comply with all of the provisions of Sections 1130 through 1132 of this Code.

 1202 Whole Building Energy Supply Metering.  For buildings with a gross conditioned floor area of 20,000 ft2 and larger, measurement devices with remote communication capability shall be provided to collect energy use data for each energy supply source to the building including gas, electricity and district steam. The system shall collect energy use data for the total building and separately for each of the end-use categories listed in Sections 1202.1 through 1202.5 and Figure 12A.

 Exceptions:

 1. Buildings where the total usage of each of the load types described in Sections 1202.1through 1202.5 is measured through the use of installed submeters or other methods approved as equivalent by the building official.

 2. Up to 5% of the total calculated load of each end-use category, as defined in Sections 1202.1 through 1202.5, may be excluded from the energy submetering requirements of this chapter.

 3. Separate metering is not required for fire pumps, stairwell pressurization fans and associated life-safety systems that operate only during testing or emergency.

 4. Health care facilities with loads in excess of 150kVA may have submetering that measures electrical energy usage in accordance with the normal and essential electrical systems identified in Article 517 of the Seattle Electrical Code.

 All measurement devices shall be configured to automatically communicate the energy data to a data acquisition system. At a minimum, measurement devices shall provide daily data. The data acquisition system shall be capable of electronically storing the data, for a minimum of 36 months, from the measurement devices and other sensing devices and creating user reports showing daily, monthly and annual energy consumption. The system shall be commissioned in accordance with Section 1416.

 ((~~Meters with remote metering capability or automatic meter reading (AMR) capability shall be provided to collect energy use data for each energy supply source to the building including gas, electricity and district stream, that exceeds the thresholds listed in Table 12-1. Utility company service entrance/interval meters are allowed to be used provided that they are configured for automatic meter reading (AMR) capability.~~

~~Master submetering with remote metering capability (including current sensors or flow meters) shall be provided for the systems that exceed the thresholds in Table 12-1 to collect overall totalized energy use data for each subsystem in accordance with Table 12-2.~~))

 Metering shall be digital-type meters for the main meter. Current sensors or flow meters are allowed for submetering. ((~~For subsystems with multiple similar units, such as multicell cooling towers, only one meter is required for the subsystem.~~)) Existing buildings are allowed to reuse installed existing analog-type utility company service/interval meters.

 1202.1 HVAC System Total Energy Use. This category shall include all energy used to provide space heating, space cooling, and ventilation to the building including boilers, chillers, pumps, fans for supply, return, relief, exhaust, and parking garages, etc.

 1202.4 Process Load System Total Energy Use. This category shall include all energy used by any non-building operation load (e.g. nonresidential refrigeration and cooking) that accounts for over 2% of the total building connected load. If the total process energy use is less than 2% of the total building connected load, the process energy use is allowed to be included in miscellaneous process energy use.

 1202.5 Miscellaneous Total Energy Use. This category shall include energy use other than those specified in Sections 1202.1 through 1202.4 including domestic hot water, elevators and escalators, and swimming pools.

 1203 Metering for New or Replacement Systems and Equipment :  Where new or replacement systems or equipment is installed in an existing building, metering shall be installed so that that system or equipment is included in the total for the corresponding end-use category in accordance with Section 1202.

 Exceptions:

 1. Where new or replacement systems or equipment that falls below the threshold in Table 12-2 is installed in an existing building that was not subject to the requirements of this chapter, no additional metering shall be required.

 2. Where new or replacement systems or equipment ((~~is installed~~)) that exceeds the threshold in ((~~Table 12-1 or~~)) Table 12-2 is installed in an existing building that was not subject to the requirements of this chapter , metering shall be installed for that system or equipment in accordance with Section  1202 ((~~1201~~)) except that a data acquisition system shall not be required for buildings less than 50,000 ft2 .

 1204 Energy Display. For each building subject to Section 1202, a permanent, readily accessible and visible display shall be provided in the building accessible by building operation and management. At a minimum the display shall be capable of providing the current energy demand for the whole building, updated for each energy source, as well as the average and peak demands for the previous day and the same day the previous year, and the total energy usage for the previous 12 months.

 Exception: For existing buildings where a data acquisition system is not required, compliance with Section 1204 shall not be required.

 ***

 1311.5 Slab-On-Grade Floor:  Slab-on-grade insulation shall be placed on the outside of the foundation or on the inside of the foundation wall. The insulation shall extend downward from the top of the slab for a minimum distance of 24 inches or downward to at least the bottom of the slab and then horizontally to the interior or exterior for the total distance of 24 inches. Above grade insulation shall be protected. A 2-inch by 2-inch (maximum) nailer may be placed at the finished floor elevation for attachment of interior finish materials.  ((~~Slab-on-grade insulation installed inside the foundation wall shall extend downward from the top of the slab a minimum distance of 24 inches or to the top of the footing, whichever is less. Insulation installed outside the foundation shall extend downward a minimum of 24 inches or to the frost line, whichever is greater. Above grade insulation shall be protected.~~

~~EXCEPTION: For monolithic slabs, the insulation shall extend downward from the top of the slab to the bottom of the footing.~~))

 1311.6 Radiant Floors (on or below grade): Slab-on-grade insulation shall extend downward from the top of the slab a minimum distance of 36 inches or downward to the top of the footing and horizontal for an aggregate of not less than 36 inches.

 ((~~If required by the building official where soil conditions warrant such insulation, t~~))  T he entire area of a radiant floor shall be thermally isolated from the soil. Where a soil gas control system is provided below the radiant floor, which results in increased convective flow below the radiant floor, the radiant floor shall be thermally isolated from the sub- floor gravel layer.

 1312 ((~~Glazing~~)) Fenestration  and Doors

 1312.1 Standard Procedure for Determination of ((~~Glazing~~)) Fenestration  and Door U- Factors: U-factors for ((~~glazing~~)) fenestration  and doors shall be determined, certified and labeled in accordance with Standard RS-31 by a certified independent agency licensed by the National Fenestration Rating Council (NFRC). Compliance shall be based on the ((~~Residential or the Nonresidential~~)) Model Size in Table 4-3 of RS-31 . Product samples used for U-factor determinations shall be production line units or representative of units as purchased by the consumer or contractor. Unlabeled ((~~glazing~~)) fenestration  and doors shall be assigned the default U-factor in Table 10-6.

 1312.2 Solar Heat Gain Coefficient and ((~~Shading Coefficient~~)) Visible Transmittance : Solar Heat Gain Coefficient (SHGC) and Visible Transmittance (VT) , shall be determined, certified and labeled in accordance with the National Fenestration Rating Council (NFRC) Standard by a certified, independent agency, licensed by the NFRC.

 EXCEPTION S :

 1.  Shading coefficients (SC)  or solar heat gain coefficient for the center of glass  shall be an acceptable alternate for compliance with solar heat gain coefficient requirements. Shading coefficients  or solar heat gain coefficient for the center of glass  for glazing shall be taken from Chapter 15 of Standard RS-1 or from the manufacturer's ((~~test~~)) data  using a spectral data file determined in accordance with NFRC 300 .

 2. For the purposes of 1323, Exception 1, visible transmittance for the center of the glazing assembly shall be taken from Chapter 15 of Standard RS-1 or from the manufacturer's data using a spectral data file determined in accordance with NFRC 300.

 3. For dynamic glazing, the minimum SHGC shall be used to demonstrate compliance with this section. Dynamic glazing shall be considered separately from other vertical fenestration, and area-weighted averaging with other vertical fenestration that is not dynamic glazing shall not be permitted.

 Informative Note: Using the exception for the SHGC for the center-of-glass does not give the full credit for the overall product (including the frame) that the NFRC-certified SHGC does. Though the SHGC for the frame is not zero (the ASHRAE Handbook of Fundamentals indicates that the SHGC can range from 0.11-0.14 for metal frames and from 0.02 to 0.07 for wood/vinyl/ fiberglass frames), the SHGC for the frame is invariably lower than that for the glass. Consequently, an NFRC-certified SHGC will generally be lower.

 Conversely, the VT for the center-of-glass overstates the VT for the overall product (including the frame). The VT for the frame is zero. Consequently, an NFRC-certified VT will always be lower. For this reason, Exception 2 to Section 1312.2 is only applicable to Exception 1 in Section 1323. It is not applicable to other sections.

 ***

 1313.2 Roof/Ceiling Assemblies: Roof/ceiling assemblies where the ventilation space above the insulation is less than an average of 12 inches shall be provided with a vapor retarder. (For enclosed attics and enclosed rafter spaces, see Section 1203.2 of the ((~~International~~)) Seattle  Building Code.) Roof/ceiling assemblies without a vented airspace, allowed only where neither the roof deck nor the roof structure are made of wood, shall provide a continuous vapor retarder with taped seams.

 EXCEPTIONS:

 1. Vapor retarders need not be provided where all of the insulation is installed between the roof membrane and the structural roof deck.

 2. Unvented attic assemblies (spaces between the ceiling joists of the top story and the roof rafters) shall be permitted if all of the following conditions are met:

 1. The unvented attic space is completely contained within the building thermal envelope.

 2. No interior vapor retarders are installed on the ceiling side (attic floor) of the unvented attic assembly.

 3. Where wood shingles or shakes are used, a minimum 1/4 inch (6 mm) vented air space separates the shingles or shakes and the roofing underlayment above the structural sheathing.

 4. Any air-impermeable insulation shall be a vapor retarder, or shall have a vapor retarder coating or covering in direct contact with the underside of the insulation.

 5. Either items a, b or c shall be met, depending on the air permeability of the insulation directly under the structural roof sheathing.

 a. Air-impermeable insulation only. Insulation shall be applied in direct contact to the underside of the structural roof sheathing.

 i. Climate Zone 1: R-10 minimum rigid board or air-impermeable insulation R-value.

 ii. Climate Zone 2: R-25 minimum rigid board or air- impermeable insulation R-value.

 c. Air-impermeable and air-permeable insulation. The air- impermeable insulation shall be applied in direct contact to the underside of the structural roof sheathing as specified per WA Climate Zone for condensation control. The air-permeable insulation shall be installed directly under the air impermeable insulation.

 i. Climate Zone 1: R-10 minimum rigid board or air-impermeable insulation R-value.

 ii. Climate Zone 2: R-25 minimum rigid board or air- impermeable insulation R-value.

 ***

 1314.2 ((~~Glazing~~)) Fenestration  and Doors: Air leakage for fenestration and doors shall be determined in accordance with NFRC 400 or AAMA/WDMA/CSA 101/I.S.2/A440 or ASTM E283 as specified below. Air leakage shall be determined by a laboratory accredited by a nationally recognized accreditation organization, such as the National Fenestration Rating Council, and shall be labeled and certified by the manufacturer. Air leakage shall not exceed:

 a. 1.0 cfm/ft2 for glazed swinging entrance doors and revolving doors, tested at a pressure of at least 1.57 pounds per square foot (psf) in accordance with NFRC 400, AAMA/WDMA/CSA 101/I.S.2/A440, or ASTM E283.

 b. 0.04 cfm/ft2 for curtain wall and storefront ((~~glazing~~)) fenestration , tested at a pressure of at least 1.57 pounds per square foot (psf) in accordance with NFRC 400, AAMA/WDMA/CSA 101/I.S.2/A440, or ASTM E283.

 c. 0.2 cfm/ft2 for all other products when tested at a pressure of at least 1.57 pounds per square foot (psf) in accordance with NFRC 400 or AAMA/WDMA/CSA 101/I.S.2/A440, or 0.3 cfm/ft2 when tested at a pressure of at least 6.24 pounds per square foot (psf) in accordance with AAMA/WDMA/CSA 101/I.S/A440.

 EXCEPTIONS:

 1. Openings that are required to be fire resistant.

 2. Field-fabricated fenestration and doors that are weather-stripped or sealed in accordance with Section 1314.1.  A field-fabricated fenestration product is a fenestration product including a glazed exterior door whose frame is made at the construction site of standard dimensional lumber or other materials that were not previously cut, or otherwise formed with the specific intention of being used to fabricate a fenestration product or exterior door. Field-fabricated does not include curtain walls.

 3. For garage doors, air leakage determined by test at standard test conditions in accordance with ANSI/DASMA 105 shall be an acceptable alternate for compliance with air leakage requirements.

 4. Units without air leakage ratings produced by small business that are weatherstripped or sealed in accordance with Section 1314.1.

 ***

 1314.6 Continuous Air Barrier: For  all buildings ((~~over five stories~~)), the building

 envelope shall be designed and constructed with a continuous air barrier to control air leakage into, or out of, the conditioned space. All air barrier components of each envelope assembly shall be clearly identified on construction documents and the joints, interconnections and penetrations of the air barrier components shall be detailed.

 Construction documents shall also contain a diagram showing the building's pressure boundary in plan(s) and section(s) and a calculation of the area of the pressure boundary to be considered in the test.

 Informative Note: As stated above, the continuous air barrier is intended to control the air leakage into and out of the conditioned space. The definition of conditioned space includes semiheated spaces and indirectly conditioned spaces, so these spaces are included when detailing the continuous air barrier and when determining the pressure boundary for conducting the air leakage test. However, unheated spaces are not included when determining the pressure boundary.

 The air leakage test is done using calibrated fans. The amount of airflow in cfm (as adjusted for temperature and pressure) at 75 Pa (0.3" w.g.) measured during the test is divided by the area of the building envelope (the pressure boundary) included in the test. Multiplying that building envelope area by 0.4 cfm will provide an indication of how many cfm are needed to perform the test (how many fans or fan capacity).

 1314.6.1 Characteristics: The continuous air barrier shall have the following characteristics:

 a. The air barrier component of each assembly shall be joined and sealed in a flexible manner to the air barrier component of adjacent assemblies, allowing for the relative movement of these assemblies and components. This requirement shall not be construed to restrict the materials or methods by which the air barrier is achieved.

 b. It shall be capable of withstanding positive and negative combined design wind, fan and stack pressures on the air barrier without damage or displacement, and shall transfer the load to the structure. It shall not displace adjacent materials under full load.

 c. It shall be installed in accordance with the manufacturer's instructions and in such a manner as to achieve the performance requirements.

 1314.6.2 Compliance: Compliance of the continuous air barrier for the ((~~opaque~~)) building

 envelope shall be demonstrated by testing the completed building and demonstrating that the  upper 95% confidence interval for the air leakage rate of the building envelope does not exceed 0.40 cfm/ft2 at a pressure differential of 0.3 inch w.g. (1.57 psf) as specified below.

 a. Whole building testing shall be accomplished in accordance with ASTM E 779 or approved similar test. Tests shall be accomplished using either  (1) both pressurization and depressurization or (2) pressurization  alone, but not depressurization alone ((~~or depressurization or both~~)). The building shall not be tested unless it is verified that the continuous air barrier is in place and installed without failures in accordance with installation instructions so that repairs to the continuous air barrier, if needed to comply with the required air leakage rate, can be done in a timely manner. Following are comments referring to ASTM E 779:

 b. Under ASTM E 779 it is permissible to test using the building's HVAC system. In buildings with multistory HVAC systems and shafts it is permissible to test using the building's mechanical system using CAN/CGSB-149.15-96 Determination of the Overall Envelope Airtightness of Buildings by the Fan Pressurization Method Using the Building's Air Handling Systems, Canadian General Standards Board, Ottawa.

 c. ((~~In lieu of the fan pressurization method described in ASTM E 779, a tracer gas test of the building air change rate in accordance with ASTM E 741 is also allowed. The tracer gas test shall be run with building HVAC fans off.~~))  Reserved.

 d. Section 8.1 - For purposes of this test, a multizone building shall be configured as a single zone by opening all interior doors, and otherwise connecting the interior spaces as much as possible. It is also allowed to test a smaller section of the building, provided the test area can be isolated from neighboring conditioned zones by balancing the pressure in adjacent conditioned zones to that in the zone being tested. This can be very difficult to do in buildings with multistory shafts and HVAC systems. If a smaller section of the building is tested, provide a drawing showing the zone(s) tested, the pressure boundaries and a diagram of the testing equipment configuration.

 e. Section 8.2 - Seal all intentional functional openings such as exhaust and relief louvers, grilles and dryer vents that are not used in the test to introduce air, using plastic sheeting and duct tape or similar materials. All plumbing traps shall be filled with water.

 f. Section 8.10 - The test pressure range shall be from ((~~10~~))  25  Pa to 80 Pa((~~. If approved by the building official, lower test pressures are acceptable~~)), but the upper limit shall not be less than 50 Pa , and the difference between the upper and lower limit shall not be less than 25 Pa .

 g. Section 9.4 - If both pressurization and depressurization are not tested, plot the air leakage against the corrected ?P for ((~~either~~)) pressurization((~~or depressurization~~)).

 h. Section 9.6.4 - If the pressure exponent n is less than ((~~0.5~~))  0.45 or greater than ((~~1~~))  0.85 , ((~~corrective work shall be performed to the continuous air barrier and~~)) the test shall be rerun with additional readings over a longer time interval .

 i. Section 10.4 - Report the air leakage rate normalized in cfm/ft2 at 0.3 inch w.g. (1.57 psf) over the total area of the building envelope air pressure boundary including the lowest floor, any below-grade walls, above- grade walls, and roof (or ceiling) (including windows and skylights) separating the interior conditioned space from the unconditioned environment.

 Informative Note: Those familiar with building air leakage testing indicate that there are three critical areas: - the junctions at the top of the building between interior and exterior walls and the roof; - the wall areas around the perimeter of the windows (not the windows themselves); and

 - brackets and other penetrations used to support exterior features such as awnings and canopies.

 For buildings with excessive air leakage, there is a methodology to determine air leakage pathways: ASTM E 1186-03 Standard Practices for Air Leakage Site Detection in Building Envelopes and Air Barrier Systems.

 1314.6.3 Certificate of Occupancy: A final certificate of occupancy shall not be issued for the building, or portion thereof, until such time that the building official determines that the project complies with one of the following:

 a. Option 1:

 i. the continuous air barrier has been inspected by a qualified person (such as the designer or a building commissioning agent) who is not associated with the construction company and an inspection report by that person has been submitted to the building official; and

 ii. the building, or portion thereof, has been field tested in accordance with Section 1314.6.2, and the test report for the whole building air leakage testing in accordance with Section 1314.6.2 is provided to DPD and filed with the inspection record for the project .

 Informative Note: Option 1 does not require that testing achieve 0.40 cfm/ft2. The requirement is that the testing be executed in accordance with Section 1314.6.2.

 b. Option 2:

 i. the building, or portion thereof, has been field tested in accordance with Section 1314.6.2 and the building air leakage does not exceed that allowed in Section 1314.6.2 .

 Informative Note: As of 2009, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers limits air leakage in its facilities to 0.25 cfm/ft2 for mold prevention and so as to reduce energy use in accordance with the 2005 U.S. Energy Policy Act. Tested buildings have been in the range of 0.16-0.25 cfm/ft2. Their experience is that few buildings have to be sealed and re-tested to meet these requirements when buildings are designed and constructed with attention to details.

 For further information on comparisons of building envelope air leakage standards and test procedures, see "U.S. Army Corps of Engineers Air Leakage Protocol for Measuring Air Leakage in Buildings", "Controlling Air Leakage in Tall Buildings" by Colin Genge, ASHRAE Journal, April 2009, pages 50- 60, and "Protocol for Field Testing of Tall Buildings to Determine Envelope Air Leakage Rate" by William Bahnfleth, Grenville Yuill, and Brian Lee, ASHRAE Transactions 1999, V. 105, Pt. 2.

 ***

 1314.7 Vestibules. Building entrances that separate conditioned space from the exterior shall be enclosed vestibules, with all doors opening into and out of the vestibule equipped with self-closing devices. Vestibules shall be designed so that in passing through the vestibule it is not necessary for the interior and exterior doors to open at the same time. Interior and exterior doors shall have a minimum distance between them of not less than 7 ft and a maximum distance of not more than 20 ft when in the closed position. The exterior envelope of conditioned vestibules shall comply with the requirements for a conditioned space. Either the interior or exterior envelope of unconditioned vestibules shall comply with the requirements for a conditioned space. The building lobby is not considered a vestibule.

 EXCEPTIONS:

 1. Building entrances with revolving doors.

 2. Doors not intended to be used as a building entrance.

 3. Building entrances in buildings that are less than four stories above grade and less than 10,000 ft2 in area.

 4. Doors that open directly from a space that is less than 3,000 ft2 in area and is separate from the building entrance.

 5. Entrances to semi-heated spaces.

 6. Elevator doors in parking garages provided that the elevators have an enclosed lobby at each level of the garage.

 Informative Note: Building entrances are defined as the means ordinarily used to gain access to the building, so this does not include the handicapped access doors that might be adjacent to a revolving door.

 Doors other than for building entrances, such as those leading to service areas, mechanical rooms, electrical equipment rooms, or exits from fire stairways, are not covered by this requirement. There is less traffic through these doors and the vestibule may limit access for large equipment.

 Enclosed lobbies in parking garages also serve to reduce the flow of vehicle exhaust into the building.

 ***

 1321 General: This section establishes building envelope design criteria in terms of

 prescribed requirements for building construction.  Compliance shall be calculated separately for the building envelope for nonresidential spaces and for residential spaces.

 ***

 1322 Opaque Envelope: Roof/ceilings, opaque exterior walls, opaque doors, floors over unconditioned space, below-grade walls, slab-on-grade floors and radiant floors enclosing conditioned spaces shall be insulated according to Section 1311 and Tables 13-1 or 13-2. Compliance with nominal R- values shall be demonstrated for the thermal resistance of the added insulation in framing cavities and/or insulated sheathing only. Nominal R-values shall not include the thermal transmittance of other building materials or air films.

 For walls where the proposed assembly would not be continuous insulation, Table 13-1 contains two alternate nominal R-value compliance options for assemblies with isolated metal penetrations of otherwise continuous insulation. These alternate nominal R-value compliance options are allowed for projects complying with all of the following:

 a. The ratio of the cross-sectional area, as measured in the plane of the wall, of metal penetrations of otherwise continuous insulation to the overall opaque wall area is:

 i. less than 0.0004 (less than 0.04%).

 ii. less than 0.0008 (less than 0.08%).

 b. The metal penetrations of otherwise continuous insulation are isolated or discontinuous (e.g. brick ties or other discontinuous metal attachments, offset brackets supporting shelf angles that allow insulation to go between the shelf angle and the primary portions of the wall structure). No continuous metal elements (e.g. metal studs, z-girts, z-channels, shelf angles) penetrate the otherwise continuous portion of the insulation.

 c. Every wall assembly shall comply with the alternate nominal R-value compliance option, regardless of where the metal penetrations are located. All wall assemblies (e.g. mass, steel-framed, wood-framed) shall comply with the option in Table 13-1 corresponding to the cross-sectional area of metal penetrations as a percentage of the overall opaque wall area.

 d. Building permit drawings shall contain details showing the locations and dimensions of all the metal penetrations (e.g. brick ties or other discontinuous metal attachments, offset brackets, etc.) of otherwise continuous insulation. In addition, calculations shall be provided showing the ratio of the cross-sectional area of metal penetrations of otherwise continuous insulation to the overall opaque wall area.

 For other cases where the proposed assembly is not continuous insulation, see Section 1332 for determination of U-factors for assemblies that include metal other than screws and nails.

 For  the U-factor compliance for all envelope components, including metal frame assemblies ((~~used in spaces with electric resistance space heat~~)), compliance shall be demonstrated with the component U-factor for the overall assembly based on the assemblies in Chapter 10.

 Area-weighted averaging of the R-value is not allowed. When showing compliance with R-values, the minimum insulation R-value for all areas of the component shall comply with Tables 13-1 and 13-2. When calculating compliance using U- factors, area-weighted averaging is allowed. Where insulation is tapered (e.g. roofs), separate assembly U-factors shall be calculated for each four-foot section of tapered insulation.

 EXCEPTION S :

 1. Opaque smoke vents are not required to meet insulation requirements.

 2. For roofs with rigid continuous insulation on the top of the roof, the insulation R-value may be averaged for compliance with minimum prescriptive R-values only, provided that both:

 a. the minimum insulation is no less than R-5 (but not including area within 6 inches of each roof drain), and

 b. the area-weighted average insulation is R-68 (in lieu of R- 38).

 Informative Note: For the application of the building envelope requirements to elevator shafts and stair enclosures, see the definition of indirectly conditioned space in Chapter 2.

 Informative Note: For the definition of continuous insulation, see Chapter 2.

 The alternate nominal R-value compliance options provided in Section 1322 and the default U-factors in Table 10- 5A(1) for assemblies with isolated metal penetrations are intended to offer several simple prescriptive choices in lieu of the complicated calculations required to determine the U-factors of assemblies with metal framing.

 While specific calculations need to be done for each project, previous calculations have found the following approximate metal penetration area ratios:

 - Brick ties alone (that penetrate otherwise continuous insulation) may well have a metal penetration area ratio of 0.0002 (0.02% of the overall opaque wall area). - Offset brackets alone (that penetrate otherwise continuous insulation) that project out to support a shelf angle (so that the shelf angle does not penetrate otherwise continuous insulation and the insulation can run between the shelf angle and the structure) could have a metal penetration area ratio of 0.0003 (0.03% of the overall opaque wall area).

 When added together, the total metal penetration area ratio of otherwise continuous insulation for a design with only these two metal penetration types is likely to be within the range where it could qualify for one of the alternate nominal R-value compliance options.  On the other hand, shelf angles alone (such as those used to support brick veneer) when attached directly to the structure without offset brackets (thereby resulting in the shelf angle penetrating otherwise continuous insulation), such as at the perimeter edge of an intermediate floor slab, are likely to have a metal penetration area ratio in the 0.20% range. Consequently, shelf angles will always need to be mounted on offset brackets that allow insulation to go between the shelf angle and the primary portions of the wall structure in order to qualify to use one of the alternate nominal R-value compliance options.

 As the overall opaque wall area is the basis of the calculation, every wall assembly must comply with the alternate nominal R-value compliance option, regardless of where the metal penetrations are located. Thus, even if the offset brackets attached to the mass wall area were the only metal penetrations (which penetrate otherwise continuous insulation), the infill steel-framed wall or wood-framed wall assemblies would still need to comply with the insulation requirements in the alternate nominal R-value compliance option as the areas of those infill walls were included in the calculation of the metal penetration area ratio.

 There also are additional fin effects where the metal contacts the surfaces on the outside of the insulation, such as a brick facade, that have not been considered. Metal cladding would certainly further degrade the effective insulation R-value.

 ***

 1323  Fenestration  ((~~Glazing~~)).  The intent is that fenestration in building facades be designed for daylighting and vary by orientation to respond to external climatic loads. Fenestration ((~~Glazing~~)) shall comply with Section 1312 and Tables 13-1 or 13-2. All glazing shall be, at a minimum, double glazing. In addition, all glazing assemblies shall have at least one low-emissivity coating unless the  fenestration ((~~glazing~~)) assembly has an overall U-factor that complies with the values in Tables 13-1 or 13-2.

 EXCEPTIONS:

 1. Vertical  fenestration ((~~glazing~~)) located on the display side of the street level story of a retail occupancy  or where there is a street level transparency requirement in the Seattle Land Use Code or in parking lot attendant booths with a gross floor area not exceeding 50 square feet  provided  in each case that  the  fenestration  ((~~glazing~~)):

 a. (i) is double-glazed with a minimum 1/2 inch airspace and with a low-e coating having a maximum emittance of e-0.10 in a nonmetal frame or a metal frame having a thermal break (as defined in footnote 2 to Table 10-6B; or

 (ii) has an area weighted U-factor of 0.50 or less , except that revolving doors and vestibules are allowed to have an area-weighted U-factor of 0.65 or less .

 (U-factor calculations shall use overall assembly U-factors. When this exception is used, there are no SHGC requirements); and

 b.  has:

 (i) a visible transmittance for the overall fenestration assembly including the frame of 0.42, or

 (ii) a visible transmittance, determined according to Section 1312.2, Exception 2, for the center of the glazing assembly of 0.48; and,

 c. does not exceed 75 % of the gross exterior wall area of the display side of the street level story measured from the top of the finished floor at street level. However, if the display side of the street level story exceeds 20 feet in height, then this exception may only be used for the first 20 feet of that story.

 When this exception is utilized, separate calculations shall be performed for these sections of the building envelope and these values shall not be averaged with any others for compliance purposes. The 75% area may be exceeded on the street level, if the additional glass area is provided from allowances from other areas of the building.

 2.  Fenestration with single ((~~Single~~)) glazing for security purposes and  in vestibules and revolving doors shall be included in the percentage of the total ((~~glazing~~)) fenestration  area, U-factor calculation and SHGC as allowed in the Tables 13-1 or 13-2. The maximum area allowed for the total of all  fenestration with single glazing is 1% of the gross exterior wall area.

 1323.1 Area: The percentage of total  fenestration area (vertical fenestration and skylights)  ((~~glazing (vertical and overhead) area~~)) relative to the gross exterior wall area shall not be greater than the appropriate value from Tables 13-1 or 13-2 for the vertical  fenestration  ((~~glazing~~)) U-factor, ((~~overhead glazing~~)) skylight  U-factor ,  ((~~and~~)) vertical fenestration  solar heat gain coefficient , skylight solar heat gain coefficient, and, where applicable, vertical fenestration visible transmittance  selected.  For buildings with below-grade wall area, the gross wall area used to calculate the allowable fenestration area shall not include the portion of below-grade walls that is more than 10 feet below grade.

 1323.2 U-Factor: The area-weighted average U-factor of vertical  fenestration  ((~~glazing~~)) shall not be greater than that specified in Tables 13-1 or 13-2 for the appropriate area and solar heat gain coefficient and, where applicable, visible transmittance . The area-weighted average U-factor of  skylights ((~~overhead glazing~~)) shall not be greater than that specified in Tables 13-1 or 13-2 for the appropriate area and solar heat gain coefficient. U-factors for ((~~glazing~~))  fenestration shall be determined in accordance with Section 1312.

 1323.3 Solar Heat Gain Coefficient: The area-weighted average solar heat gain

 coefficient of ((~~all glazing~~))  fenestration shall be calculated separately for vertical fenestration and for skylights and shall not be greater than that specified in Tables 13-1 or 13-2 for the appropriate area and U-factor and, where applicable, visible transmittance .

 EXCEPTIONS:

 1.  Fenestration  ((~~Glazing~~)) separating conditioned space from semi-heated space or unconditioned space.

 2. Vertical  fenestration with a north orientation  ((~~glazing which is oriented within 45 degrees of north~~)) shall be allowed to have a maximum solar heat gain coefficient SHGC-0.10 above that required in Tables 13-1 and 13-2.  When this exception is utilized, separate calculations shall be performed for this vertical fenestration and these values shall not be averaged with any others for compliance purposes.

 3. For demonstrating compliance for vertical  fenestration  ((~~glazing~~)) for the first SHGC option in Tables 13-1 and 13-2 only, the SHGC in the proposed building shall be allowed to be reduced by using the multipliers in the table below for each  fenestration  ((~~glazing~~)) product shaded by permanent projections that will last as long as

 the building itself. Permanent projections consisting of open louvers shall be considered to provide shading, provided that no sun penetrates the louvers during the peak sun angle on June 21. For demonstrating compliance for vertical fenestration shaded by partially opaque permanent projections (e.g., framing with glass or perforated metal) that will last as long as the building itself, the PF shall be reduced by multiplying it by a factor that accounts for the solar transmittance.

</table> Projection factor (PF) is the ratio of the horizontal depth of the external shading projection (A) divided by the sum of the height of the fenestration and the distance from the top of the fenestration to the bottom of the farthest point of the external shading projection (B), in consistent units. (See Figure 13B.)

 Informative Note: The projection factor multiplier is used to adjust the SHGC in the proposed design for purposes of Exception 3 above. The SHGC criteria in Table 13-1 do not change.

 For example, for a building with a 27% fenestration area, the SHGC required in Table 13-1 for vertical fenestration is SHGC-0.35 maximum.

 As a simple example, if the proposed building had vertical fenestration only on the south side of the building and all the fenestration had an NFRC-certified SHGC-0.45, then the fenestration alone would not comply with the maximum SHGC criteria for vertical fenestration. However, if there were an overhang projecting out over the vertical fenestration a distance A of two feet, and the vertical height from the bottom of the window to the bottom of the tip of the overhang were a distance B of six feet, then the projection factor (PF) would be = A/B = 2 ft/6 ft = 0.33.

 From the table to Exception 3 above, the multiplier is 0.74 for a 0.33 PF for south-oriented windows. For compliance purposes, SHGC-0.45 x 0.74 multiplier = 0.33 adjusted SHGC. Therefore, the vertical fenestration in the proposed design complies with the SHGC criteria provided this overhang is installed.

 Note that for most projects, use of this exception is more complicated. Calculations must be done separately for each window with a different SHGC and with a different overhang A or different height B that changes the projection factor, and for each orientation as north-oriented fenestration has a different multiplier.

 1323.4 Visible Transmittance: The area-weighted average visible transmittance of all vertical fenestration shall not be greater than that specified in Table 13-1 for the appropriate area.

 ***

 1331 General: Buildings or structures whose design heat loss rate (UAp) and solar heat gain coefficient rate (SHGC * Ap) are less than or equal to the target heat loss rate (UAt) and solar heat gain coefficient rate (SHGC * At) shall be considered in compliance with this section. The stated U- factor, F-factor or allowable area of any component assembly, listed in Tables 13-1 or 13-2, such as roof/ceiling, opaque wall, opaque door,  vertical fenestration, skylight ((~~glazing~~)), floor over conditioned space, slab-on-grade floor, radiant floor or opaque floor may be increased and the U-factor or F-factor for other components decreased, provided that the total heat gain or loss for the entire building envelope does not exceed the total resulting from compliance to the U-factors, F-factors or allowable areas specified in this section.  Compliance shall be calculated separately for the building envelope for nonresidential spaces and for residential spaces.

 EXCEPTION S :

 1. Compliance is also allowed to be shown using RS-32 for Climate Zone 1 except

 a. for buildings  using footnote 2 to Table 13-1  ((~~containing attic roofs, wood framed walls or vertical fenestration with nonmetal frames, or~~))  and

 b. for Group R occupancies.

 2. The prescriptive approach in Section 1323 may be used for that portion of the building envelope that complies with Exception 1 to Section 1323.

 1332 Component U-factors. The U-factors for typical construction assemblies are included in Chapter 10. These values shall be used for all calculations. Where proposed construction assemblies are not represented in Chapter 10, values shall be calculated in accordance with Chapters 16 through 18 and 25 through 27 in Standard RS-1 listed in Chapter 7, using the framing factors listed in Chapter 10.

 For envelope assemblies containing metal framing, the U-factor shall be determined by one of the following methods:

 1. Results of laboratory measurements according to acceptable methods of test.

 2. Standard RS-1, listed in Chapter 7, where the metal framing is bonded on one or both sides to a metal skin or covering.

 3. The zone method as provided in Chapter 27 of Standard RS-1, listed in Chapter 7.

 4. Effective framing/cavity R-values as provided in Table 10-5A (2) .

 5. Mass wall assemblies having exterior insulation with isolated metal penetrations (such as offset brackets supporting shelf angles that allow insulation to go between the shelf angle and the primary portions of the mass wall structure) where the ratio of the cross- sectional area of metal penetrations of otherwise continuous insulation to the mass wall area only is less than 0.0004 (less than 0.04% of the mass wall area only), it is acceptable to use the U-factors shown in Table 10- 5B(3) for assemblies with 1 inch metal clips at 24 inches on center horizontally and 16 inches on center vertically. When this option is used, building permit drawings shall contain a detail showing the offset bracket with the insulation passing between the shelf angle and the primary portions of the mass wall structure. In addition, calculations shall be provided showing the ratio of the cross-sectional area of metal penetrations to the mass wall area.

 When return air ceiling plenums are employed, the roof/ceiling assembly shall:

 1. For thermal transmittance purposes, not include the ceiling proper nor the plenum space as part of the assembly; and

 2. For gross area purposes, be based upon the interior face of the upper plenum surface.

 Informative Note: For further information about compliance for assemblies with isolated metal penetrations, see Section 1322 and the default U-factors in Table 10-5A(1).

 1333 UA Calculations: The target UAt and the proposed UAp shall be calculated using Equations 13-1 and 13-2 and the corresponding areas and U-factors from Table 13-1 or 13-2. For the target UAt calculation, the ((~~overhead glazing~~)) skylights  shall be located in roof/ceiling area and the remainder of the ((~~glazing~~)) fenestration  allowed per Table 13-1 or 13-2 shall be located in the wall area.  Where insulation is tapered, separate assembly U-factors shall be calculated in accordance with Section 1322. (See also the criteria in Section 1331.)

 Informative Note: For the application of the building envelope requirements to elevator shafts and stair enclosures, see the definition of indirectly conditioned space in Chapter 2.

 Procedural Requirement: The plans shall contain a fenestration and opaque door schedule.

 The fenestration schedule shall include all vertical fenestration and skylights (curtain walls, windows, sliding and swinging glass doors and glazed roll-up doors, glass block, plastic panels, clerestories, skylights, etc.), as well as all opaque doors (swinging metal egress doors, roll-up warehouse doors, etc.).

 For all projects, the fenestration and opaque door schedule shall include the manufacturer and model number for all products regardless of U-factor.

 The fenestration and opaque door schedules shall include the product type, size, number of each type, the U-factor and whether the U-factor is NFRC-certified or default.

 If the product is claimed to be NFRC-certified, the NFRC Certified Products Directory (CPD) number shall be provided. A simulation report is not acceptable as this does not demonstrate that the product complies with the NFRC rating, labeling, and certification program. Also, a specification sheet that states "determined in accordance with NFRC 100" does not suffice.

 For site-built fenestration products (as defined by NFRC) ONLY, at the time of building permit application, it is acceptable to provide simulation reports from an NFRC-accredited simulation laboratory for each product type that is to be installed in the project. The simulation must include the specific frame profiles, glazing options, gas fills, spacers, etc. that are proposed to be installed in the building. However, the NFRC Label Certificate is required to be provided to the building inspector at the construction site. (AAMA 507 reports, thermal performance matrices, and certificates of compliance are not acceptable.)

 If a default U-factor from Chapter 10 is used for unrated products in lieu of NFRC certification, the fenestration and opaque door schedule shall include a description of the key energy-efficiency features that are necessary to achieve that default U-factor (indicating whether the fenestration product is fixed or operable, frame material type, thermal break description, number of glazing layers, emissivity of low-e coatings, gap width, gas fill, spacer, type, etc.).

 For fenestration in nonresidential spaces, the fenestration schedule shall also include the solar heat gain coefficient for each product and, where applicable, visible transmittance.

 1334 Solar Heat Gain Coefficient Rate Calculations: Solar heat gain coefficient shall comply with Section 1323.3. The target SHGCAt and the proposed SHGCAp shall be calculated using Equation 13-3 and 13-4 and the corresponding areas and SHGCs from Table 13-1 or 13-2. The target SHGC is the SHGC from Table 13-1 without the projection factor.

 1335 Visible Transmittance Calculations:

 Visible transmittance rate shall comply with Section 1323.4. The target VTAt and the proposed VTAp shall be calculated using Equations 13-5 and 13-6 and the corresponding areas and VTs from Table 13-1.

 Informative Note: There is no visible transmittance requirement or calculations required to show code compliance when the proposed total fenestration (vertical and overhead) area relative to the gross exterior wall area is in the 0-30% category of Table 13-1.

 Footnotes

 1.  Daylighting with Plastic Skylights. For plastic skylights, the SHGC is allowed to be SHGC-0.65 maximum provided that:

 ( a) the visible transmittance (VT) is greater than the SHGC and

 (b) the skylight area is no greater than 6% of the overhead daylight zone.

 ((~~Nonresidential walls may be ASTM C90 concrete block walls, ungrouted or partially grouted at 32 inches or less on center vertically and 48 inches or less on center horizontally, with ungrouted cores filled with material having a maximum thermal conductivity of 0.44 Btu*in/h*ft2* degrees F.~~))

 2. In nonresidential spaces, up to 10% of the actual vertical fenestration with metal framing is allowed to be operable fenestration with an area-weighted-average assembly maximum U-Factor (NFRC-certified or default per Section 1006) of U-0.45 provided that:

 (a) the total operable fenestration area does not exceed 10% of the total vertical fenestration (actual fixed plus operable) area,

 (b) the total fenestration (vertical and overhead) area does not exceed 40% of the gross exterior wall area, and

 (c) the building utilizes an HVAC energy management system that notifies building occupants of acceptable time periods (based on outdoor air temperatures) when the operable fenestration may be manually opened for natural ventilation and that disables HVAC operation at the perimeter zones when outdoor air conditions for natural ventilation are met. If approved by the building official, other similar control strategies are allowed to be used where they are shown to reduce the HVAC perimeter zone energy consumption when used in conjunction with natural ventilation from operable fenestration.

 This footnote does not apply to fenestration with nonmetal framing. This footnote is not allowed to be used for the RS-29 or RS-32 compliance options.

 This footnote is allowed to be used for the Component Performance compliance option in Sections 1330 through 1335 provided that the Proposed Design complies with (a), (b), and (c).

 When this footnote is utilized, separate calculations shall be performed for the operable fenestration and these values shall not be averaged with any others for compliance purposes.

 Informative Note: For the application of the building envelope requirements to elevator shafts and stair enclosures, see the definition of indirectly conditioned space in Chapter 2.

 Informative Note: For further information about compliance for assemblies with isolated metal penetrations, see Section 1322 and the default U-factors in Table 10-5A(1).

 Procedural Requirement: The plans shall contain a fenestration and opaque door schedule.

 The fenestration schedule shall include all vertical fenestration and skylights (curtain walls, windows, sliding and swinging glass doors and glazed roll-up doors, glass block, plastic panels, clerestories, skylights, etc.), as well as all opaque doors (swinging metal egress doors, roll-up warehouse doors, etc.).

 For all projects, the fenestration and opaque door schedule shall include the manufacturer and model number for all products regardless of U-factor.

 The fenestration and opaque door schedules shall include the product type, size, number of each type, the U-factor and whether the U-factor is NFRC-certified or default.

 If the product is claimed to be NFRC-certified, the NFRC Certified Products Directory (CPD) number shall be provided. A simulation report is not acceptable as this does not demonstrate that the product complies with the NFRC rating, labeling, and certification program. Also, a specification sheet that states "determined in accordance with NFRC 100" does not suffice.

 For site-built fenestration products (as defined by NFRC) ONLY, at the time of building permit application, it is acceptable to provide simulation reports from an NFRC-accredited simulation laboratory for each product type that is to be installed in the project. The simulation must include the specific frame profiles, glazing options, gas fills, spacers, etc. that are proposed to be installed in the building. However, the NFRC Label Certificate is required to be provided to the building inspector at the construction site. (AAMA 507 reports, thermal performance matrices, and certificates of compliance are not acceptable.)

 If a default U-factor from Chapter 10 is used for unrated products in lieu of NFRC certification, the fenestration and opaque door schedule shall include a description of the key energy-efficiency features that are necessary to achieve that default U-factor (indicating whether the fenestration product is fixed or operable, frame material type, thermal break description, number of glazing layers, emissivity of low-e coatings, gap width, gas fill, spacer, type, etc.).

 For fenestration in nonresidential spaces, the fenestration schedule shall also include the solar heat gain coefficient for each product and, where applicable, visible transmittance.

 1402 Mechanical Ventilation: The minimum requirements for ventilation shall comply with the ((~~Washington State Mechanical Code (WAC 51-52)~~)) Seattle Mechanical Code .

 1410 General Requirements. The building mechanical system shall comply with Sections

 1411 through 1416, Sections 1440 through 1443, Sections 1450 through 1454,  Sections 1470 and 1475, and with one of the following paths:

 a. Simple Systems (Packed Unitary Equipment), Sections 1420 through 1424

 b. Complex Systems, Sections 1430 through 1439

 c. Systems Analysis. See Section 1141.4

 Systems serving cold storage spaces and frozen storage spaces in refrigerated warehouses shall meet the requirements of Sections 1416, 1437, and 1460 through 1465 .

 1411 ((~~HVAC~~))  Mechanical  Equipment Performance Requirements.

 Informative Note: As indicated in Section 1120, the Energy Code applies to industrial facilities, as well as commercial and industrial processes. Thus, the equipment efficiency requirements apply to industrial facilities, as well as systems and equipment used in commercial and industrial processes.

 1411.1 General: Equipment shall have a minimum performance at the specified rating conditions not less than the values shown in Tables 14-1A through 14-1G.  Air conditioners primarily serving computer rooms and covered by ASHRAE Standard 127 shall comply with the requirements in Table 14- 1A(2). All other air conditioners shall comply with the requirements in Table 14-1A(1). If a nationally recognized certification program exists for a product covered in Tables 14-1A through14-1G, and it includes provisions for verification and challenge of equipment efficiency ratings, then the product shall be listed in the certification program.

 Informative Note: The AHRI certification program is nationally recognized and it does include provisions for verification and challenge of equipment efficiency ratings. Consequently, if equipment is subject to an AHRI Standard, it shall be listed in the AHRI certification program.

 For equipment not within the scope of the standards in Table 14-1A through 14-1G, this Code does not contain any minimum efficiency requirements. However, for any claims of efficiency, such as for calculations using the RS-29 compliance option, data shall be furnished by the equipment manufacturer consisting of a complete report from a test performed by an independent laboratory accredited by a nationally recognized accreditation organization.

 Gas-fired and oil-fired forced air furnaces with input ratings ? 225,000 Btu/h (65 kW) and all unit heaters shall also have an intermittent ignition or interrupted device (IID), and have either mechanical draft (including power venting) or a flue damper. A vent damper is an acceptable alternative to a flue damper for furnaces where combustion air is drawn from the conditioned space. All furnaces with input ratings ? 225,000 Btu/h (65 kW), including electric furnaces, that are not located within the conditioned space shall have jacket losses not exceeding 0.75% of the input rating.

 Chilled water plants and buildings with more than 500 tons total capacity shall not have more than 100 tons provided by air-cooled chillers.

 EXCEPTIONS:

 1. Where the designer demonstrates that the water quality at the building site fails to meet manufacturer's specifications for the use of water-cooled equipment.

 2. Air-cooled chillers with minimum efficiencies at least 10 percent higher than those listed in Table 14-1C.

 3. Replacement of existing equipment.

 Cooling towers serving chilled water systems shall be selected to be able to maintain a

 return condenser water temperature to the tower of 86 degrees F or less at peak design conditions,

 except for replacement cooling towers of the same or smaller capacity in existing buildings where physical constraints preclude a change from the original design.

 Hydronic heat pump and other cooling and refrigeration equipment (e.g. icemakers, walk-in coolers) shall not use domestic water only one time before dumping it to waste (no

 single pass water cooling systems are allowed). The only exceptions are: replacement of existing icemakers; or use of single pass cooling for medical and dental equipment during power outages and other emergencies.

 1411.2 Rating Conditions: Cooling equipment shall be rated at AHRI test conditions and procedures when available.  If equipment is rated in accordance with an AHRI Standard, it shall be rated at AHRI Standard Rating Conditions, not "design" conditions. Where no applicable procedures exist, data shall be furnished by the equipment manufacturer consisting of a complete report from a test performed by an independent laboratory accredited by a nationally recognized accreditation organization.

 1411.2.1 Water-Cooled Centrifugal Water-Chilling Packages-- Nonstandard Conditions: Water-cooled centrifugal water- chilling packages that are not designed for operation at AHRI Standard 550/590 test conditions reflected in Table 14-1C (44 degrees F leaving chilled-water temperature and 85 degrees F entering condenser water temperature with 3 gpm/ton condenser water flow) shall have maximum full-load kW/ton and NPLV ratings adjusted using Equation 14-1.

 The adjusted full load and NPLV values are only applicable over the following full-load design ranges:

 ? Minimum leaving chilled water temperature: 38 degrees F;

 ? Maximum condenser entering water temperature: 102 degrees F;

 ? Condenser water flow: 1 to 6 gpm/ton; and

 ? X > 39 and Chillers designed to operate outside of these ranges or applications utilizing fluids or solutions with secondary coolants (e.g., glycol solutions or brines) with a freeze point of 27 degrees F or lower from freeze protection are not covered by this standard.

 EQUATION 14-1

 Adjusted maximum full-load kW/ton rating = (Full load kW/ton from Table 14-1C)/Kadj

 Adjusted maximum NPLV rating = (IPLV from Table 14-1C)/Kadj

 Where:

 Kadj = 6.174722 - 0.303668(X) + 0.00629466(X)2 - 0.000045780(X)3

 X = DTstd + LIFT

 DTstd = (24 + [full load kW/ton from Table 14-1C] x 6.83)/Flow

 Flow = Condenser water flow (gpm)/cooling full load capacity (tons)

 LIFT = CEWT - CLWT

 CEWT = Full load condenser entering water temperature ( degrees F)

 CLWT = Full load condenser leaving chilled water temperature ( degrees F)

 ***

 1411.4 Packaged  and Split System Electric Heating and Cooling Equipment:

 Packaged  and split system electric equipment providing both heating and cooling , and cooling only equipment with electric heat in the main supply duct before VAV boxes, in each case  with a total cooling capacity greater than 20,000 Btu/h ,  shall be a heat pump.

 EXCEPTION: Unstaffed equipment shelters or cabinets used solely for personal wireless service facilities.

~~EXCEPTION: A parking garage ventilation system having a total design capacity under 8,000 cfm may use a time clock or occupant sensors.~~))

 1412.9.3  System Activation Devices for Enclosed Motor Vehicle Repair Garages. Ventilation systems for enclosed motor vehicle repair garages shall operate continuously and shall be staged or vary fan speed by gas sensors.

 EXCEPTION: Motor vehicle repair garages are permitted to shutdown during periods when the garage is closed provided there is a manual override switch for garage employees to enable the system after hours and the gas detection system is continuously active to stage fans or vary fan speed to maintain specified gas concentration levels below specified maximum levels.

 1412.10 Single Zone Variable-Air-Volume Controls. HVAC systems shall have variable airflow controls as follows:

 a. Air-handling and fan-coil units with chilled-water cooling coils and supply fans with motors greater than or equal to 5 hp shall have their supply fans controlled by variable-speed drives or electronically-commutated motors. At cooling demands less than or equal to 50%, the supply fan controls shall be able to reduce the airflow to no greater than the larger of the following:

 1. One half of the full fan speed, or

 2. The volume of outdoor air required to meet the ventilation requirements of the Seattle Mechanical Code.

 b. Effective January 1, 2012, all air- conditioning equipment and air-handling units with direct expansion cooling and a cooling capacity, at the rating conditions in the AHRI standard appropriate to the equipment, greater than or equal to 110,000 Btu/h that serve single zones shall have their supply fans controlled by variable-speed drives or electronically- commutated motors. At cooling demands less than or equal to 50%, the supply fan controls shall be able to reduce the airflow to no greater than the larger of the following:

 1. Two-thirds of the full fan speed, or

 2. The volume of outdoor air required to meet the ventilation requirements of the Seattle Mechanical Code.

 ***

 1413.1 Operation: Air economizers shall be capable of automatically modulating outside and return air dampers to provide 100 percent of the design supply air as outside air to

 reduce or eliminate the need for mechanical cooling.  The design supply air is the total airflow provided through the heating or cooling source. Systems shall provide a means to

 relieve excess outdoor air during air economizer operation to prevent overpressurizing the building. Air economizers shall be used for RS-29 analysis base case for all systems without exceptions in Sections 1413, 1423, or 1433. Water economizers, when allowed by Section 1132.2 exception 1 or Section 1433 exceptions 3 and 9, shall be capable of providing the total concurrent cooling load served by the connected terminal equipment lacking airside economizer, at outside air temperatures of 50 degrees F dry-bulb/45 degrees F wet-bulb and below. For this calculation, all factors including solar and internal load shall be the same as those used for peak load calculations, except for the outside temperatures.

 ***

 1413.3 Integrated Operation: The HVAC system and its controls shall allow economizer operation when mechanical cooling is required simultaneously. Air and water economizers shall be capable of providing partial cooling even when additional mechanical cooling is required to meet the remainder of the cooling load.

 ((~~EXCEPTIONS:~~

~~1. Individual, direct expansion units that have a rated capacity less than 65,000 Btu/h and use nonintegrated economizer controls that preclude simultaneous operation of the economizer and mechanical cooling.~~

~~2. Water-cooled water chillers with waterside economizer.~~))

 ***

 1413.5 Economizer Heating System Impact. Any HVAC system that increases the building heating energy use during economizer operation is not allowed (e.g. single-fan/dual-duct systems and multizone systems).

 EXCEPTION: Where the heating is allowed by Section 1435.

 Informative Note: Single-fan/dual-duct systems and multizone systems do not comply with this requirement. This is because economizer operation lowers the temperature of the air entering the hot deck heating coil, increasing its energy use. In order to use this type of system, the system must meet one of the economizer exceptions and have neither type of economizer. (Another resolution is to use a dual-fan/dual-duct system where the hot deck fan supplies only return air or return air plus minimum ventilation air.)

 This requirement will not affect three-deck multizone since they cannot work with an air economizer in any case (it would make the neutral deck a cold deck).

 An exception to this Section 1413.5 is provided for economizers on VAV systems that cause zone level heating to increase due to a reduction in supply air temperature. Reducing supply air temperatures on a cooling-VAV system will reduce fan energy (particularly if the system has a variable speed drive), offsetting the energy lost due to increased reheat energy.

 See the discussion and diagrams in the ASHRAE Standard 90.1-2007 User?s Manual, Section 6.5.1.4, page 6-52.

These requirements include insulation installation, moisture control, air leakage, and building envelope insulation levels. ((~~Unheated equipment rooms with combustion air louvers shall be isolated from the conditioned space by insulating interior surfaces to a minimum of R-11 and any exterior envelope surfaces per Chapter 13~~)). Outside air ducts serving individual supply air units with less than 2,800 cfm of total supply air capacity shall be insulated to a minimum of R-7 and are not considered building envelope. Other outside air duct runs are considered building envelope until they,

 1. connect to the heating or cooling equipment, or

 2. are isolated from the exterior with an automatic shut-off damper complying with Section 1412.4.1.

 Once outside air ducts meet the above listed requirements, any runs within conditioned space shall comply with Table 14-5 requirements.

 1431.2 System Sizing Limits: Heating and cooling design loads for the purpose of sizing systems shall be determined in accordance with one of the procedures described in Chapter 29 of Standard RS-1 listed in Chapter 7 or an equivalent computation procedure. For interior temperatures, 70 degrees F shall be used for heating and 75 degrees F for cooling, except where different values are specified in the Washington Administrative Code (WAC).  For exterior temperatures, 24 degrees F shall be used for heating and 82 degrees F dry bulb and 66 degrees F for wet bulb for cooling.

 Building mechanical systems for all buildings which provide space heating and/or space cooling shall be sized no greater than 150 percent of the design load as calculated above, except that cooling towers shall comply with the sizing requirements in Section 1411.1. No additional safety factor is allowed.

 For buildings with a total equipment cooling capacity of 300 tons and above, the equipment shall comply with one of the following:

 1. No one unit shall have a cooling capacity of more than 2/3 of the total installed cooling equipment capacity;

 2. The equipment shall have a variable speed drive; or

 3. The equipment shall have multiple compressors.

 EXCEPTION: The following limited exemptions from the sizing limit shall be allowed; however, in all cases heating and/or cooling design load calculations shall be submitted.

 1. For a single piece of equipment which has both heating and cooling capability, only one function, either the heating or the cooling, need meet the requirements of this section. Capacity for the other function shall be, within available equipment options, the smallest size necessary to meet the load.

 2. Stand-by equipment may be installed if controls and devices are provided which allow redundant equipment to operate automatically only when the primary equipment is not operating.

 3. Multiple units of the same equipment type, such as multiple chillers and boilers, with combined capacities exceeding the design load, or a single unit that is capable of modulating to a part-load capacity of 50 percent of the load or less, may be specified to operate concurrently only if controls are provided that sequence or otherwise optimally control the operation of each unit based on load.

 4. Installed space heating equipment output that does not exceed 10 Btu/h per square foot of gross conditioned floor area and installed space cooling equipment output that does not exceed 15 Btu/h per square foot of gross conditioned floor area. No additional safety factor is allowed.

 1431.3 Hydronic System Design: All chilled water and condenser water piping shall be designed such that the design flow rate in each pipe segment shall not exceed the values listed in Table 14-3 for the appropriate total annual hours of operation. Pipe size selections for systems that operate under variable flow conditions (e.g. modulating 2-way control valves at coils) and that contain variable speed pump motors are allowed to be made from the "Variable Flow/Variable Speed" columns. All others shall be made from the "Other" columns. (Note: The flow rates listed here do not consider noise or erosion. Lower flow rates are often recommended for noise sensitive locations.)

 EXCEPTION: Design flow rates exceeding the values in Table 14-3 are allowed in specific sections of pipe if the pipe in question is not in the critical circuit at design conditions and is not predicted to be in the critical circuit during more than 30% of operating hours.

 ***

 1432.2 Systems Temperature Reset Controls

 1432.2.1 Air Systems for Multiple Zones: Systems supplying heated or cooled air to multiple zones shall include controls which automatically reset supply air temperatures by representative building loads. Temperature shall be reset by at least 25 percent of the design supply-air-to-room-air temperature difference. Interior zones without an exterior wall load impact and high occupancy areas (per Section 1412.8) shall have maximum airflow sized to meet typical cooling loads with the higher reset air temperature.

 EXCEPTIONS:

 1. Where specified humidity levels are required to satisfy process needs, such as computer rooms or museums.

 2. Systems that prevent reheating, recooling, or mixing of heated and cooled air supply.

 3. 75 percent of the energy for reheating is from site-recovered or site solar energy sources.

 4. Zones with peak supply air quantities of 300 cfm or less.

 5. Dedicated outdoor air systems less than 5,000 cfm with separate thermal controls.

 1432.2.2 Hydronic Systems: Systems with a design capacity of 300,000 Btu/h or greater supplying heated or mechanically refrigerated water shall include controls which automatically reset supply water temperatures by representative building loads or by outside air temperature. Temperature shall be reset by at least 25 percent of the design supply-to-return water temperature differences.

 EXCEPTIONS:

 1. Steam boilers.

 2. Systems that provide heating with 100 degrees F or lower supply temperature (e.g., water source heat pump loops).

 To limit the heat loss from the heat rejection device (cooling tower), for hydronic heat pumps connected to a common heat pump water loop with central devices for heat rejection (e.g., cooling tower):

 a. If a closed-circuit tower (fluid cooler) is used, either an automatic valve shall be installed to bypass all but a minimal flow of water around the tower (for freeze protection), or low leakage positive closure dampers shall be provided.

 b. If an open-circuit tower is used directly in the heat pump loop, an automatic valve shall be installed to bypass all heat pump water flow around the tower.

 c. If an open-circuit tower is used in conjunction with a separate heat exchanger to isolate the tower from the heat pump loop, then heat loss shall be controlled by shutting down the circulation pump on the cooling tower loop.

 For hydronic heat pumps connected to a common heat pump water loop with central devices for heat rejection (e.g., cooling tower) and having a total pump system power  5 hp and greater  ((~~exceeding 10 hp~~)), each hydronic heat pump shall have:

 a. A two-position two-way (but not three-way) valve, or

 b. A variable head pressure two-way (water regulating) control valve or pump.

 For the purposes of this section, pump system power is the sum of the nominal power demand (i.e., nameplate horsepower at nominal motor efficiency) of motors of all pumps that are required to operate at design conditions to supply fluid from the heating or cooling source to all heat transfer devices (e.g., coils, heat exchanger) and return it to the source. This converts the system into a variable flow system and, as such, the primary circulation pumps shall comply with the variable flow requirements in Section 1438.

 ***

 1433 Economizers. Air economizers meeting the requirements of Section 1413 shall be provided on all ((~~new~~)) systems including those serving computer server rooms, electronic

 equipment, radio equipment, telephone switchgear , medical and laboratory equipment, and also on redundant equipment .

 EXCEPTIONS:

 1.  a. Qualifying small equipment: This exception shall not be used for unitary cooling equipment installed outdoors or in a mechanical room adjacent to the outdoors. This exception is allowed to be used for other cooling units and split systems with a total cooling capacity rated in accordance with Section 1411.2 of less than 33,000 Btu/h (hereafter referred to as qualifying small systems) provided that these are high- efficiency cooling equipment with SEER and EER values more than 15% higher than minimum efficiencies listed in Tables 14-1A, 14-1B and 14-1D, in the appropriate size category, using the same test procedures. Equipment shall be listed in the appropriate certification program to qualify for this exception. The total capacity of all qualifying small equipment without economizers shall not exceed 72,000 Btu/h per building, or 5% of its air economizer capacity, whichever is greater. That portion of the equipment serving Group R Occupancy is not included in determining the total capacity of all units without economizers in a building. Redundant units are not  included in determining the total capacity of all units without economizers in a building  ((~~counted in the capacity limitations~~)). This exception shall not be used for the shell-and-core permit or for the initial tenant improvement (i.e. the first time that the space is occupied)  or for RS-29 analysis.

 b. Qualifying very-small very-high efficiency equipment: This exception shall not be used for unitary cooling equipment installed outdoors or in a mechanical room adjacent to the outdoors. This exception is allowed to be used for other cooling units and split systems with a total cooling capacity rated in accordance with Section 1411.2 of less than or equal to 24,000 Btu/h (hereafter referred to as "qualifying very-small very-high efficiency equipment") provided that these are high-efficiency cooling equipment with SEER and EER values more than 64% higher than minimum efficiencies listed in Tables 14-1A, 14-1B and 14-1D, in the appropriate size category, using the same test procedures. If a unit is rated with an IPLV, IEER or SEER, then to eliminate the required economizer, the minimum cooling efficiency of the HVAC unit shall be increased by the percentage shown. If the HVAC unit is only rated with a full load metric like EER or COP cooling then these shall be increased by the percentage shown. Equipment shall be listed in the appropriate certification program to qualify for this exception. The total capacity of all qualifying very-small very-high efficiency equipment without economizers shall not exceed 24,000 Btu/h per tenant space. This exception shall not be used for the shell-and-core permit or for the initial tenant improvement or for RS-29 analysis.

 Informative Note: Exception 1 is only applicable to HVAC equipment that complies with Section 1411.1 and is regulated in Tables 14-1A, 14-1B and 14-1D.

 Section 1411.1 requires that "if a nationally recognized certification program exists for a product covered in Tables 14-1A through 14-1G, and it includes provisions for verification and challenge of equipment efficiency ratings, then the product shall be listed in the certification program." As of the date of adoption of this Code, the AHRI program does satisfy those criteria. Therefore, products subject to the AHRI standards must be listed in the AHRI certification program.

 In Tables 14-1A, 14-1B, and 14-1D, virtually all of the equipment efficiency ratings are required to be determined in accordance with an AHRI Standard (though some products are rated in accordance with ASHRAE Standard 127). Energy Code compliance is determined at standard conditions (not at project specific conditions). Compliance should be verifiable through the AHRI directory at www.ahridirectory.org. It is not acceptable for a manufacturer to submit its own calculations for AHRI standards.

 Consequently, to use exception 1 to Section 1433, a product must both: be within the scope of the specified AHRI standard and be included in the AHRI certification program (except for those products rated in accordance with ASHRAE Standard 127). Certain equipment used in computer server rooms is not within the scope of the standards listed in Tables 14-1A, 14-1B, and 14-1D and is not eligible for certification. Therefore, such equipment does not qualify to use exception 1 to Section 1433 (though it may qualify to use another exception).

 Informative Note: The exceptions to Section 1433 generally are not equal-energy alternates to a system with air economizer. For example, the 15% higher efficiency cooling units allowed in Exception 1a do not come close to providing equivalence to air economizer.

 However, in response to requests, ASHRAE has calculated the improvement in cooling equipment efficiency necessary to compensate for the lack of outside air cooling capability of an economizer. For western Washington, the cooling equipment efficiency improvement required is 64%. This is the basis for the criteria in Exception 1b. At the time this Code was adopted, it was not known whether there were equipment models on the market that could be shown to meet the criteria in Exception 1b.

 2. Chilled water terminal units connected to systems with chilled water generation equipment with IPLV values more than 25% higher than minimum part load efficiencies listed in Table 14-1C, in the appropriate size category, using the same test procedures. Equipment shall be listed in the appropriate certification program to qualify for this exception. The total capacity of all systems without economizers shall not exceed ((~~480,000~~))  72,000 Btu/h per building, or ((~~20~~))  5 % of its air economizer capacity, whichever is greater. That portion of the equipment serving Group R Occupancy is not included in determining the total capacity of all units without economizers in a building. This exception shall not be used for the shell-and-core permit or for the initial tenant improvement or for RS-29 analysis.

 3. Water-cooled refrigeration equipment ((~~serving chilled beams and chilled ceilings space cooling systems only~~)) which are provided with a water economizer meeting the requirements of Section 1413 and that serve only the following space cooling systems:

 a. chilled floor slabs not covered with other material and having direct exposure to the space,

 b. chilled beams,

 c. chilled ceilings .

 Water economizer capacity per building shall not exceed 500 tons. This exception shall not be used for RS-29 analysis.

 Informative Note: This water economizer exception applies to equipment that only serves chilled floor slabs, chilled beams, and chilled ceilings space cooling systems. Chilled floor slabs, chilled beams, and chilled ceilings space cooling systems are often partnered with Direct Outside Air Supply (DOAS) systems. The DOAS system is not included in this exception and must comply with the air economizer requirements, unless it qualifies for one of the other exceptions.

 4. Systems for which at least 75% of the annual energy used for mechanical cooling is provided from site-recovery or site-solar energy source.

 5. Systems where special outside air filtration and treatment, for the reduction and treatment of unusual outdoor contaminants, makes an air economizer infeasible.

Equipment shall be listed in the appropriate certification program to qualify for this exception. For split-systems, compliance is based on the cooling capacity of individual fan coil units.

 Informative Note: Chillers with fan coil units do not qualify for this exception as chillers are not covered in Tables 14-1A, 14-1B, or 14-1D. Most variable refrigerant flow (VRF) systems are too large and also do not qualify for this exception, as AHRI 1230, the standard for rating the efficiency of VRF systems in Tables 14-1A(3)-(4), bases the capacity on the outside unit size.

 Informative Note: Options 9a and 9b are only applicable to HVAC equipment that complies with Section 1411.1 and is regulated in Tables 14-1A and 14-1B.

 Section 1411.1 requires that "if a nationally recognized certification program exists for a product covered in Tables 14- 1A through 14-1G, and it includes provisions for verification and challenge of equipment efficiency ratings, then the product shall be listed in the certification program." As of the date of adoption of this Code, the AHRI program does satisfy those criteria. Therefore, products subject to the AHRI standards must be listed in the AHRI certification program.

 In Tables 14-1A and 14-1B, virtually all of the equipment efficiency ratings are required to be determined in accordance with an AHRI Standard (though some products are rated in accordance with ASHRAE Standard 127). As specified in Section 1411.2, Energy Code compliance is determined at standard conditions (not at project specific conditions). Compliance should be verifiable through the AHRI directory at www.ahridirectory.org. It is not acceptable for a manufacturer to submit its own calculations for AHRI standards.

 Equipment used in computer server rooms that is within the scope of ASHRAE Standard 127, Method of Testing for Rating Computer and Data Processing Room Unitary Air Conditioners is also eligible to use exception 9 option 9c to Section 1433.

 Informative Note: For hydronic systems over 300,000 Btuh, see Section 1432.2.2.

 a. Reheating for temperature control.

 b. Recooling for temperature control.

 c. Mixing or simultaneous supply of air that has been previously mechanically heated

 and air that has been previously cooled, either by economizer systems, ((~~ground water~~))  ground-coupled hydronic loops , or by mechanical refrigeration.

 d. Other simultaneous operation of heating and cooling systems to the same zone.

 e. Reheating for humidity control.

 EXCEPTIONS:

 1. Variable air volume (VAV) systems which, during periods of occupancy are designed and controlled:

 1.1 To reduce the primary air supply to each zone to a minimum air volume when the zone temperature is in a 5 degrees F (3 degrees C) zone temperature dead band after cooling is no longer required and before reheating, recooling or mixing takes place. This minimum volume shall be no greater than the larger of the following:

 1.1.1 Twenty percent of the peak supply volume; or

 1.1.2 The volume of outdoor air required to meet zone ventilation requirements, unless increasing the volume to critical zones (zones with the highest ratio of outside air to total supply air) beyond the minimum ventilation requirements results in a decrease in overall outside air required by the HVAC system. An increase beyond minimum ventilation rates shall not be applied to more than 20 percent of the zones with reheat on any one system excluding zones equipped with ventilation controls for high occupancy areas required by Section 1317.2.2.

 1.2 So the volume of air that is reheated, recooled, or mixed in peak heating demand shall be less than 50 percent of the zone design peak supply rate.

 1.3 So the airflow between dead band and full heating or full cooling shall be modulated.

 1.4 So the control logic of each system shall have means preventing changes in setpoint(s) from inducting simultaneous heating and cooling (including economizer cooling) except for humidity control or zone controls operating as described under exception 1.1.

 2. Zones where special pressurization relationships, cross-contamination requirements, or code-required minimum circulation rates are such that variable air volume systems are impractical, such as some areas of hospitals and laboratories. Systems which use this exception and supply heated or cooled air to multiple zones shall include:

 2.1 Controls that automatically reset supply air temperatures by representative building loads or by outside air temperature unless it can be shown that supply air temperature reset increases overall building annual

 energy costs.  In all cases, these controls shall comply with the requirements in Section 1432.2.

 2.2 Variable speed drives for supply ,  ((~~and~~)) return , and exhaust  fans,  modulating pressure independent zone dampers on all zones (supply, return, and exhaust fans where applicable) , specified occupied and unoccupied or low occupancy airflows, and have controls which reduce airflow in response to changes in occupancy levels.

 3. Zones where at least 75% of the energy for reheating or for providing warm air in mixing systems is provided from a site-recovered (including condenser heat) or site solar energy source.

 4. Zones where specific humidity levels are required to satisfy process needs, such as ((~~computer rooms,~~)) museums, surgical suites, and buildings with refrigerating systems, such as supermarkets, refrigerated warehouses, and ice arenas. This exception does not apply to computer rooms.

 5. Zones with a peak supply air quantity of 300 cfm (142 L/s) or less.

 6. Three deck multizone systems that mix economizer-cooled (mixed) air with heated or cooled air where the temperature of the economizer-cooled air is reset based on weighted zone heating and cooling loads and zone airflow is reduced to a minimum of 20% design airflow or the volume of outdoor air required to meet zone ventilation requirements before mixing is allowed.

 1436 ((~~Heat~~))  Energy  Recovery.

 Informative Note: As indicated in Section 1120, the Energy Code applies to industrial facilities, as well as commercial and industrial processes. Thus, the energy recovery requirements apply to industrial facilities, as well as systems and equipment used in commercial and industrial processes.

For the purposes of sizing the energy recovery system, the applicant shall submit calculations demonstrating that the system will provide at least 50% heat recovery effectiveness.  Fifty percent heat recovery effectiveness shall mean an increase in the outside air supply temperature at design heating conditions of one half the difference between the outdoor design air temperature and 65 degrees F. Provision shall be made to bypass or control the ((~~heat~~))  energy  recovery system to permit air economizer operation as required by Section 1433. ((~~Heat~~))  Energy  recovery energy may be provided from any site-recovered or site-solar source. Where a single room or space is supplied by multiple units, the aggregate ventilation (cfm) of those units shall be used in applying this requirement.  The return/exhaust air stream temperature for heat recovery device selection shall be 70 degrees F.

 Informative Note: In Seattle, the outdoor design air temperature is 24 degrees F as specified in Table 3-1. The difference between 24 degrees F and 65 degrees F is 41 degrees. One-half of 41 degrees is 20.5 degrees. Therefore, to provide 50% heat recovery effectiveness in Seattle, the heat recovery system shall raise the outside supply air temperature to a minimum of 44.5 degrees F (24 degrees F + 20.5 degrees F) at the outdoor design conditions.

 EXCEPTIONS: These exceptions only apply to the particular exhaust subsystems. The remaining cfm of the main supply system is subject to the energy recovery requirements.

The required heat recovery system shall have the capacity to provide the smaller of:

 a. 60 percent of the peak heat rejection load at design conditions; or

 b. 50 percent of the sum of the service water heating load plus space heating load.

</table> a. Net sensible cooling capacity: The total gross cooling capacity less the latent cooling less the energy to the air movement system. (Total Gross - - latent -- Fan Power)

 b. Sensible coefficient of performance (SCOP-127): a ratio calculated by dividing the net sensible cooling capacity in watts by the total power input in watts (excluding re-heaters and humidifiers) at conditions defined in ASHRAE Standard 127. The net sensible cooling capacity is the gross sensible capacity minus the energy dissipated into the cooled space by the fan system.

 i. luminaires or lamps which have a reflector or louver assembly to direct the light;

 ii. fixtures are fitted with ceramic metal halide lamps not exceeding 150 watts; and

 iii. electronic ballasts.

 1531 Interior Lighting Power Allowance: The interior lighting power allowance shall be calculated by multiplying the gross interior floor area, in square feet, by the appropriate unit lighting power allowance, in watts per square foot, for the use as specified in Table 15-1. Accessory uses, including corridors, lobbies and toilet facilities shall be included with the primary use.

 The lighting power allowance for each use shall be separately calculated and summed to obtain the interior lighting power allowance.

 In cases where a lighting plan for only a portion of a building is submitted, the interior lighting power allowance shall be based on the gross interior floor area covered by the plan. Plans submitted for common areas only, including corridors, lobbies and toilet facilities shall use the lighting power allowance for common areas in Table 15- 1.

 When insufficient information is known about the specific use of the space, the allowance shall be based on the apparent intended use of the space.

 Compliance shall be demonstrated separately for covered parking.

 Informative Note: Section 1510 prohibits trading between interior and exterior lighting, and prohibits trading between parking garage lighting and other interior lighting or exterior lighting.

 1532 Exterior lighting power allowance. All exterior building grounds luminaires that operate at greater than 100 watts shall contain lamps having a minimum efficacy of 60 lm/W unless the luminaire is controlled by a motion sensor or qualifies for one of the following exceptions.

 The total exterior lighting power allowance for all exterior building applications is the sum of the base site allowance plus the individual allowances for areas that are designated on the buildings plans to be illuminated and are permitted in Table 15-2B for the applicable lighting zone. Trade-offs are allowed only among exterior lighting applications listed in the Table 15-2B "Tradable Surfaces" section. The lighting zone for building exterior is determined from Table 15-2A((~~unless otherwise specified by the local jurisdiction~~)).

 EXCEPTION: Lighting used for the following exterior applications is exempt when equipped with a control device independent of the control of the nonexempt lighting:

 a. Specialized signal, directional, and marker lighting associated with transportation.

 b. ((~~Lighting integral to~~))  Internally- illuminated  signs.

 c. Lighting integral to equipment or instrumentation and installed by its manufacturer.

</table> 1620 Prescriptive Option for On-Site Renewable Energy Systems.

 1621 Annual Production of On-site Renewable Energy Systems. Building projects shall contain on-site renewable energy systems that provide the annual energy production equivalent of 500 Btu/ft2 of gross conditioned floor area. The annual energy production shall be the combined sum of all on- site renewable energy systems.

 1630 Alternate Means of Compliance.

 1631 Development by Director?s Rule. The Director of DPD shall develop and adopt by rule one or more alternate means of compliance for this Chapter. Each alternate means of compliance shall be designed to achieve energy savings that are at least as great as the energy production achieved over the expected life of the building through compliance with Section 1621. Alternate means allowed by rule may include, without limitation, payments or contributions related to off- site renewable energy production.

 On-site renewable energy systems are preferred. This section is intended to ensure that a feasible alternative is available when the nature of a site or project makes on-site renewable energy systems impracticable, without requiring a determination as to practicality in each case. This section is not intended to authorize any financially more attractive means of compliance for a typical project than compliance with Section 1621, taking into account expected costs and benefits of each option over the expected life of the building, and without regard to any subsidies that may be available for on- site renewable energy systems.

 Informative Note: The 2030 Challenge specifies a set of total building energy consumption thresholds that gradually reduce over time to reach net-zero energy consumption in new buildings by 2030. (A rough rule-of-thumb from those working on net-zero energy buildings in the Northwest is that net-zero energy buildings would be achieved by a combination of a 75% reduction in building energy load with the remaining 25% being provided by on-site renewable energy.)  The 2010 threshold is for new buildings to use at least 60% less energy than the average existing building. Taking office buildings as an example, the maximum energy use for new office buildings in Seattle is approximately 32,400 Btu/ft2ùyr (as the baseline for the average existing office building is 81,000 Btu/ft2ùyr).  The value of 500 Btu/ft2 of gross conditioned floor area is approximately 1.5 % of the total energy consumption of a new office building complying with the 2030 Challenge and consuming 32,400 Btu/ft2ùyr. As service water heating loads in office buildings are often in the range of 3-5% of total energy consumption, this means that a solar water heating system could be an option for complying with the prescriptive on-site renewable energy system option (as an alternative to photovoltaics).  For photovoltaic (PV) systems, local conservative rules of thumb are 1000 kWh and 100 ft2 per kW of DC rated PV capacity. In practice, performance in any given year may be 1200 kWh/kW or higher, based on metered data from customer systems in the Seattle City Light service area (approximately 235 systems as of early 2010). Some newer crystalline modules are rated at 12 - 14 W/ft2.  See DPD?s Client Assistance Memo 420, Solar Energy Systems, for discussion of permit requirements, land use requirements, design and installation considerations, interconnection and net metering requirements, financial incentives, and sources for further information.

 Section 16. The following sections or subsections of Reference Standard 29 of the 2009 Washington State Energy Code are amended as follows:

 ((~~APPENDIX~~))

 REFERENCE STANDARD 29

 (RS-29)

 NONRESIDENTIAL  AND MULTIFAMILY RESIDENTIAL BUILDING DESIGN

 BY SYSTEMS ANALYSIS

 ***

 REFERENCE STANDARD -29

 NONRESIDENTIAL  AND MULTIFAMILY RESIDENTIAL BUILDING DESIGN BY SYSTEMS ANALYSIS

 NOTE: ((~~Washington State~~)) Seattle  Energy Code Reference Standard 29 (RS-29) is a modified version of Appendix G from ASHRAE/IESNA Standard 90.1-2007. RS-29 has been completely rewritten from the 2006 Edition.

 ***

 1.1 General: This Standard establishes design criteria in terms of total energy consumption of a building, including all of its systems.

 The building permit application for projects utilizing this Standard shall include in one submittal all building and mechanical drawings and all information necessary to verify that the building envelope and mechanical design for the project corresponds with the annual energy analysis. If credit is proposed to be taken for lighting energy savings, then an electrical permit application shall also be submitted and approved prior to the issuance of the building permit. If credit is proposed to be taken for energy savings from other components, then the corresponding permit application (e.g., plumbing, boiler, etc.) shall also be submitted and approved prior to the building permit application. Otherwise, components of the project that would not be approved as part of a building permit application shall be modeled the same in both the proposed building and the baseline

 building and shall comply with the requirements of the ((~~Washington State~~))  Seattle Energy Code.

 1.2 Performance Rating. This performance rating method requires conformance with the following provisions:

 All requirements of Sections 1201 through ((~~1202~~)) 1204 , 1310 through 1314, 1410 through 1416, 1440 through 1446, 1450 through 1455, 1460 through 1465, 1510 through 1514, and 1540 are met. These sections contain the mandatory provisions of the standard and are prerequisites for this rating method.  The proposed design shall not vary from those requirements in Sections 1320 through 1334, 1420 through 1439, 1470, 1475, 1520 through 1532, and 1620 through 1621 except to the extent those variations have been accurately and completely modeled. Where variations are not specifically analyzed, the proposed design shall comply with the requirements of the sections referred to in the preceding sentence.

 The improved performance of the proposed building design is calculated in accordance with provisions of this ((~~appendix~~)) standard  using the following formula:

<table><tr><td>Percentage improvement

</td><td>=

</td><td>100 x (Baseline building performance ‑ Proposed building performance) / Baseline building performance

</td></tr>

</table> A "proposed building" designed in accordance with this standard will be deemed as complying with this Code, if the calculated annual energy consumption is 5% LESS than that of a corresponding "baseline building."  Notes: 1. Both the proposed building performance and the baseline building performance shall include all end-use load components, such as receptacle and process loads.

 2. Neither the proposed building performance nor the baseline building performance are predictions of actual energy consumption or costs for the proposed design after construction. Actual experience will differ from these calculations due to variations such as occupancy, building operation and maintenance, weather, energy use not covered by this procedure, changes in energy rates between design of the building and occupancy, and the precision of the calculation tool.

 1.3 Trade-Off Limits. When the proposed modifications apply to less than the whole building, only parameters related to the systems to be modified shall be allowed to vary. Parameters relating to unmodified existing conditions or to future building components shall be identical for determining both the baseline building performance and the proposed building performance. Future building components shall meet the requirements of Sections 1320 through 1334, 1420 through 1439,  1470, 1475, ((~~and~~)) 1530 through 1532 , and 1620 through 1631 .

 1.4 Documentation Requirements: Simulated performance shall be documented, and documentation shall be submitted to the building official in accordance with the Reporting Format in Section 5 of RS-29 . The information submitted shall include  the material specified in Section 5 of RS-29 as well as the following:

 a. Calculated values for the baseline building performance, the proposed building performance, and the percentage improvement.

 b. A list of the energy-related features that are included in the design and on which the performance rating is based. This list shall document all energy features that differ between the models used in the baseline building performance and proposed building performance calculations.

 c. Input and output report(s) from the simulation program or compliance software including a breakdown of energy usage by at least the following components: Lights, internal equipment loads, service water heating equipment, space heating equipment, space cooling and heat rejection equipment, fans, and other HVAC equipment (such as pumps). The output reports shall also show the amount of time any loads are not met by the HVAC system for both the proposed design and baseline building design.

 d. An explanation of any error messages noted in the simulation program output.

 ***

 2.3 Climatic Data: The simulation program shall perform the simulation using hourly values of climatic data, such as temperature and humidity from representative climatic data, for the site in which the proposed design is to be located. For cities or urban regions with several climatic data entries, and for locations where weather data are not available, the designer shall select available weather data that best represent the climate at the construction site. The selected weather data shall be approved by the building official.

 Exterior design conditions are 24 degrees F dry bulb for heating and 82 degrees F dry bulb/66 degrees F wet bulb for cooling.

 For ground temperatures for below-grade wall and basement floor heat loss calculations, it is acceptable to use an annual average ground temperature of 53 degrees F. If monthly temperatures are desired, the following values are acceptable: J - 49 degrees F, F - 48 degrees F, M - 49 degrees F, A - 51 degrees F, M - 53 degrees F, J - 55 degrees F, J - 57 degrees F, A - 58 degrees F, S - 57 degrees F, O - 55 degrees F, N - 53 degrees F, D - 51 degrees F.

 2.4 Energy Conversion: The comparison between the baseline building and proposed design shall be expressed as kBtu input per square foot of conditioned floor area per year at the building site. Buildings which use electricity as the only fuel source, comparisons may be expressed in kWh. When converting electricity in kWh to kBtu a multiplier of 3.413 kWh/kBtu shall be used.

 EXCEPTION: On-site renewable energy sources or site recovered energy shall not be considered to be consumed energy and shall not be included in the proposed building performance.  When Chapter 16 of this Code applies, baseline building performance shall exclude from consumed energy the amount that is or would be provided by on-site renewable energy sources to comply with the prescriptive option in Section 1621 . ((~~Where~~))  To the extent that on-site renewable or site-recovered sources are used and  would not be required to satisfy Section 1621 , the baseline building performance shall be based on the energy source used as the backup energy source or on the use of electricity if no backup energy source has been specified.

 2.5 Exceptional Calculation Methods. Where no simulation program is available that adequately models a design, material, or device, the building official may approve an exceptional calculation method to demonstrate above-standard performance using this method.

 Applications for approval of an exceptional method shall include documentation of the calculations performed and theoretical and/or empirical information supporting the accuracy of the method.

 If there are multiple designs, materials or devices that the simulation program does not model, each shall be calculated separately and energy savings from the exceptional method determined for each. Unless otherwise approved by the building official, at no time shall the total energy savings from the exceptional method constitute more than one-half of the difference between the baseline building performance and the proposed building performance. All applications for approval of an exceptional method shall include:

 a. step-by-step documentation of the exceptional calculation method performed detailed enough to enable the reader to reproduce the results;

 b. copies of all spreadsheets used to perform the calculations;

 c. a sensitivity analysis of energy consumption when each of the input parameters is varied from half to double the value assumed;

 d. calculations performed on a time step basis consistent with the simulation program used;

 e. the percentage improvement calculated with and without the exceptional calculation method.

 ***

 3.1 Building Performance Calculations. The simulation model for calculating the proposed and baseline building performance shall be developed in accordance with the requirements in Table 3.1.  The specifications of the proposed design used in the analysis shall be as similar as is reasonably practical to those in the plans submitted for a permit. In all cases, the baseline building shall comply with Sections 1320 through 1334, 1420 through 1439, 1470, 1475, 1520 through 1532, and 1620 through 1631. Where this Code does not contain requirements, the specifications and operations of the standard design and of the proposed design shall be identical. Where assumptions are not specified in this Code, the values shall be based on accepted engineering practice and are subject to the review and approval of the building official.

 For the baseline building and the proposed building, shading by permanent structures and terrain shall be taken into account for computing energy consumption whether or not these features are located on the building site. A permanent fixture is one that is likely to remain for the life of the proposed design.

 ***

 3.1.2.2 Equipment Capacities. The equipment capacities for the baseline building design shall be based on sizing runs for each orientation (per Table 3.1, No. 5a) and shall be oversized by 15% for cooling and 25% for heating, i.e., the ratio between the capacities used in the annual simulations and the capacities determined by the sizing runs shall be 1.15 for cooling and 1.25 for heating. Unmet load hours for the proposed design or baseline building designs shall not exceed 300 (of the 8760 hours simulated), and unmet load hours for the proposed design shall not exceed the number of unmet load hours for the baseline building design ((~~by more than 50~~)). ((~~If unmet load hours in the proposed design exceed the unmet load hours in the baseline building by more than 50, simulated capacities in the baseline building shall be decreased incrementally and the building resimulated until the unmet load hours are within 50 of the unmet load hours of the proposed design.~~)) If unmet load hours for the proposed design or baseline building design exceed 300, simulated capacities shall be increased incrementally, and the building with unmet loads resimulated until unmet load hours are reduced to 300 or less. Alternatively, unmet load hours exceeding these limits may be accepted at the discretion of the building official provided that sufficient justification is given indicating that the accuracy of the simulation is not significantly compromised by these unmet loads.

 ***

 3.1.2.9 System Fan Power. System fan electrical power for supply, return, exhaust, and relief (excluding power to fan- powered VAV boxes) shall be calculated using the following formulas:

 For Systems 1 and 2,

 Pfan = CFMS ? 0.3.

 For Systems 3 through 8,

 Pfan = bhp ? 746/Fan Motor Efficiency.

 Where:

 Pfan = Electric power to fan motor (watts) and

 bhp = Brake horsepower of baseline fan motor from Table 3.1.2.9. Single zone variable-air-volume systems shall comply with the constant volume fan power limitation.

 Fan Motor Efficiency = The efficiency from Table 14-4 for the next motor size greater than the bhp using the enclosed motor at 1800 rpm.

 CFMS = The baseline system maximum design supply fan airflow rate in cfm.

Any other envelope assembly that covers less than 5% of the total area of that assembly type (e.g., exterior walls) need not be separately described provided that it is similar to an assembly being modeled. If not separately described, the area of an envelope assembly shall be added to the area of an assembly of that same type with the same orientation and thermal properties.

</table> Wk = Weekday

 1. Schedules for occupancy, lighting, receptacle, HVAC system, and service hot water are from ASHRAE Standard 90.1-1989 and addendums, except that 5% emergency lighting has been added for all off hours. Elevator schedules, except for restaurants, are from the U.S. Department of Energy Standard Evaluation Techniques except changed to 0% when occupancy is 0%. These values may be used only if actual schedules are not known.

 2. Lighting profiles are modified to reflect the requirement for occupancy sensors in Section 1513.6. For parking garage lighting, the schedule has been revised to accompany the office schedule: the lighting in the parking garage is set to be on at 100% for all hours when the building occupancy is 10% or greater, but reduced to 50% (per Section 1513.6) for all hours when the building occupancy is less than 10%. For a parking garage serving a use other than office, it is acceptable to modify the parking garage schedule to parallel that use.

 Section 5 -- Reporting Format.

 The reporting format has been developed to guide both staff and applicants through the energy analysis process. The report (three copies are to be submitted) begins with a text summary including project description, methodology description, and a discussion of the estimated energy consumption differences. These are accompanied by an appendix which has summary forms, calculations to support the inputs, and copies of the computer inputs and outputs (all with numbered pages).

 The text and summary forms are among the most important parts of the submittal. This information is read prior to any review of the computer inputs and outputs to give an overall orientation to the project. The first evaluation of the project is based on a review of the text and summary forms. These indicate what the key energy-efficiency strategies are and form the basis for a more-detailed review of the drawings and of the computer analysis. Information for statistical summaries or other evaluations is drawn from the text and summary forms. While these may be the last items completed by the applicant prior to submittal, the importance of having them complete and accurate cannot be overemphasized.

 I. Executive Summary

 The executive summary is the condensed version of the text. This is usually several paragraphs long, never more than one page, and includes:

 1.  A brief description of the project with name, address, number of stories, and total square footage, as well as a listing of the various uses and the square footage of each use.

 2.  An explanation about why the systems analysis compliance option was chosen (i.e. what elements of the Proposed Design do not comply with the prescriptive option).

 3.  A listing of the key energy efficiency features that are being used to compensate for the elements that do not comply.

 4.  The total energy consumption on a Btu-per- conditioned-square-foot-per-year basis for both the Standard Design and the Proposed Design, and the percentage ratio of the Proposed Design to the Standard Design (i.e. what the energy efficiency improvement has been).

 II. Project Description

 The project description is a detailed summary of the project. First is the name and the street address as well as adjacent cross-streets or streets on all four sides of the building if it is a full-block development. Indicate the number of stories and total square footage. A listing of the various uses and square footage of each use should be done on a floor-by-floor or a system-by-system basis. Thus, for mixed-use floors, specify how much is office and how much is retail, or how much is office and how much is lab. Include parking garage number of floors and area in the listing.

 The description should also include information on the energy efficiency of the Proposed Design systems.

 1.  For the building envelope: indicate the glazing area, and how the fenestration U-factor and SHGC compare with the Standard Design requirements; and point out any opaque component U-factors or R-values which are better than the Standard Design requirements.

 2.  For each HVAC system: provide an explanation of the system including area served, key features, economizer percentage, control strategies, etc. Indicate any differences between the Standard Design and the Proposed Design, such as equipment efficiency.

 3.  For the lighting: indicate whether any tradeoffs are included in this analysis, and, if so, what they are.

 4.  For other end-uses: indicate any differences between the Standard Design and the Proposed Design.

 It is intended that the material in this section be descriptive, supporting calculations are to be included in the appendices.

 III. Methodology Description

 The methodology description is an explanation of any aspects of the modeling which are unusual or not perfectly clear. (The algorithms in approved analysis programs are generally acceptable and do not need to be explained.) For example:

 1.  Explain what shading by adjacent buildings has been included in the analysis and how it has been modeled (e.g. either using the program capabilities or as a north-facing wall, etc.).

 2.  If there are below-grade walls and floors, explain how the heat loss has been modeled for these (e.g. either as an exterior wall with a limited ground temperature variation or as a constant negative load to a zone, etc.)

 3.  If a program cannot model a system exactly, explain why the modeling assumptions used are the best representation of that system.

 It is intended that the material in this section provide a heads-up for anything unusual. Again, it is intended that the material in this section be descriptive, supporting calculations are to be included in the appendices.

 IV. Discussion of Estimated Energy Consumption Differences

 The discussion of estimated energy consumption differences is a summary and explanation of the energy savings.

 1.  First, list the total energy consumption on a Btu-per-conditioned-square-foot-per-year basis for both the Standard Design and the Proposed Design, and the percentage ratio of the Proposed Design to the Standard Design (i.e. what the energy efficiency improvement would be).

 2.  Then, review the energy savings by end-use, starting with the end-use which has the largest difference as a percent of the Standard Design total. Attempt to correlate the differences by end-use with the strategies used. While some changes will have a simple, direct correlation with consumption, other end-use differences may have a more complex explanation due to interactive effects. For example:

 -  Changes in exterior lighting will have a simple, direct correlation with consumption.

 -  Differences in space heating and space cooling are likely due to a combination of building envelope and HVAC system strategies. (Lacking any better information, the following procedure can provide a rough-cut disaggregation. First, determine the ratio of the design heating load of the Proposed Design to the design heating load of the Standard Design. Multiply the space heating energy consumption of the Standard Design by this ratio and assume that the resulting figure is what the space heating energy consumption would have been for the Proposed Design if only the building envelope had changed. This difference is what could be attributed to the building envelope. Second, determine the ratio of the average equipment efficiency of the Proposed Design to the average equipment efficiency of the Standard Design. Multiply the space heating energy consumption from the first step by this ratio and assume that the resulting figure is what the space heating energy consumption would have been for the Proposed Design if only the building envelope and equipment efficiency had changed. This second difference is what could be attributed to changes in equipment efficiency. Finally, assume that whatever energy consumption differences remain are due to other HVAC system strategies. Follow this same process for space cooling, starting with a comparison of loads, then equipment efficiency, then system type. Differences in economizer cycle, however, add another layer of complexity.)

 This section should, at a minimum, provide confirmation that the results of the analysis are reasonable.

 Section 17. A new Reference Standard 35 to the Seattle Energy Code is adopted, as follows:

 REFERENCE STANDARD - 35 ADVANCED CRITERIA FOR OTHER PROGRAMS

 Reference Standard (RS)-35 contains advanced criteria for energy efficiency and energy conservation beyond the requirements of the Seattle Energy Code. The goal of these criteria is to achieve compliance with the 2030 Challenge. This RS-35 is adopted for incorporation in programs, agreements, or initiatives toward that goal.

 PRESCRIPTIVE COMPLIANCE OPTION

 Comply with the 2009 Seattle Energy Code with the following modifications and additions:

 Section 901, Additional Residential Energy Efficiency Requirements: Achieve a minimum of five credits (instead of one credit) from Table 9-1 or, if using the exception, achieve 30 percent less (instead of 16 percent less) than the target building energy use in Chapter 4.

 Section 1314.6.2.1, Testing of Overall Building Air Leakage: Tested air leakage of 0.25 cfm/ft2 maximum for all buildings (instead of 0.40 cfm/ft2).

 Sections 1320-1323, Prescriptive Building Envelope Option: Compliance to be based on Table A13-1 Advanced Criteria (instead of Table 13-1). See below.

 Sections 1330-1334, Component Performance Building Envelope Option: Compliance to be based on Table A13-1 Advanced Criteria (instead of Table 13-1).

 Section 1411.1, HVAC Equipment Performance Requirements, General: Building projects to have high-efficiency mechanical equipment, meaning that 90% of the equipment from each table (same category) has an efficiency that is 1.10 times the corresponding minimum efficiency in Tables 14-1A through 14- 1G. The absolute gain in minimum efficiency shall be in addition to that required elsewhere in the code such as for Section 1433 and Section 1132.2.

 Section 1521, Prescriptive Interior Lighting Requirements: This section is not allowed to be used.

 Section 1531, Interior Lighting Power Allowance: The interior lighting power allowance shall be no greater than 0.90 times the lighting power allowance in Table 15-1.

 Section 1532, Exterior Lighting Power Allowance: The exterior lighting power allowance shall be no greater than 0.90 times the lighting power allowance in Table 15-2.

 Section 18. A new Reference Standard 36 to the Seattle Energy Code is adopted, as follows:

 REFERENCE STANDARD - 36 ILLUSTRATIVE GOALS FOR THE 2030 CHALLENGE IN SEATTLE

 Note that these tables are only a reference point, not prescriptive standards nor a means of compliance.

 How to use these tables:

 The building types listed in bold define a broad building activity category. Some of the broader building type categories are broken down into more specific building activities. The building types in regular type are regional numbers calculated by Target Finder for zip code 98104 using default project parameters. For building types available in Target Finder, use Target Finder and input project specific parameters in order to establish an accurate target.

 When identifying your building within this table, first identify where your building?s function falls within the broader blue categories. Then determine if you are able to identify your building?s function more specifically by the white categories underneath. Matching your building?s main use activities most closely with the building use descriptions below will give you the most accurate energy performance target. Please note all site EUI values displayed below are annual figures.

 Targets can be calculated for mixed use buildings by multiplying site EUI for each type by the square footage for that type, summing the totals of energy use by type and dividing by total square footage.

 Secondary Space/Building Types -- Ambulatory Surgical Center, Computer Data Center, Garage, Open Parking Lot and Swimming Pool -- available in Target Finder, are not presented here. More complex projects containing these secondary uses are advised to use Target Finder to establish a target.
