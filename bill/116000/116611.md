The STATE, at its own expense, shall repair any damage attributable to the PROJECT.

 3.1.7 The STATE shall provide SCL with an overall schedule for the SCL Facilities Work, and shall coordinate with SCL to schedule shutdowns and SCL crew work. Schedule updates will be promptly communicated to SCL upon receipt by the STATE.

 3.1.8 The STATE shall take the lead in holding meetings with SCL to develop qualification criteria for potential construction contractors for Specialty Work. Qualification criteria will be incorporated into the contract bid document. The STATE shall consult with SCL on the contractors and subcontractors bidder qualifications for Specialty Work. SCL shall provide comments to the STATE on known bidder qualifications. The STATE shall not allow unqualified contractors to perform Specialty Work.

 3.1.9 The STATE shall provide all labor, materials, equipment, and tools required to excavate, provide trench support systems, and handle and dispose of all spoils (including contaminated soils, groundwater, and other debris), and provide a safe workplace for SCL staff per applicable state and federal laws, and City of Seattle standards, for the SCL Facilities Work in accordance with the Approved Plans and any SCL-approved revisions to the Approved Plans. The STATE will not provide personal protective equipment for SCL staff.

 3.1.10 The STATE shall provide SCL with material submittals for SCL review per SCL Material Standards and the City of Seattle Standard Specifications, and shall respond in a timely manner to all SCL review comments on Change Orders, contractor submittals, and design discrepancies, pursuant to Sections 7, 8 and 11 of the SDOT Holgate to King Stage 2 Agreement and Sections 5 and 8 herein.

 3.1.11 If there are two (2) or more manufacturers listed in the SCL Material Standards and the STATE's contractor chooses to utilize a manufacturer not listed, the STATE shall have its contractor follow the Material Evaluation Procedure found in the SCL Material Standards. The STATE shall have its contractor provide to the STATE a Material Evaluation Form for approval determination with supporting documentation that the proposed material or equipment meets or exceeds SCL requirements, and, as appropriate, a sample of material or equipment for SCL evaluation. The STATE will forward the request along with supporting documentation and sample to SCL for evaluation. SCL will review the submittal and respond to the STATE within fifteen (15) Business Days. Rejection of proposed equipment manufacturers by SCL will be based upon failure to meet SCL technical specifications, or lack of history demonstrating product use within the electrical power industry in the United States. If there is only one (1) manufacturer listed in the SCL Material Standards, the STATE shall require its contractor to utilize that manufacturer.

 3.1.12 The STATE agrees to ensure there will be two (2) manufacturers of cable included in the listing of proprietary items and will make certain that one (1) of these two (2) manufacturers will be utilized.

 3.1.13 The STATE shall resolve field problems found by SCL's on-site inspector pursuant to Section 11 herein.

 3.1.20 The STATE recognizes that SCL requires advance notice of 26 kV power outages needed for construction to schedule crews, notify customers and accommodate other previously scheduled outage requests. The STATE shall submit a request in writing, thirty (30) calendar days prior to any necessary outages specifying the electrical boundaries, the date the outage will begin and the date the SCL Facilities can be energized and put into service. SCL shall accommodate such requests unless prohibited by operational necessity, a previously scheduled outage conflicts with the outage requested by the STATE, or emergency conditions prohibit the outage or limit the availability of crews. If denied, SCL shall assist the STATE in finding another outage window. If granted, SCL shall outline any conditions related to such outage to the STATE.

 3.1.21 The STATE recognizes that the currently proposed alignment of SCL's 26 kV pole line adjacent to the Burlington Northern and Santa Fe Railway Company (BNSF) Tail Track on the west side of Alaskan Way between South Atlantic Street and South King Street restricts SCL's access to the pole line for operation and maintenance. This will add operating and maintenance costs necessary to meet BNSF requirements for working adjacent to the railroad tracks. The STATE agrees to reimburse SCL for the net present value of the incremental increase in costs to operate and maintain this section of 26 kV transmission line for a period of twenty (20) years, pursuant to Section 6.2 herein.

The STATE shall pay for all Change Orders that are not Betterments or New Work. No delay costs shall be paid by SPU.

 8.2 SPU may request additions and changes to the construction contract through the STATE. The STATE shall comply with the requested elective change provided that the change is within the general scope of the PROJECT and complies with the PROJECT permits, state and/or federal law and applicable rules, codes and/or regulations. The STATE retains the right to reject requested elective changes if incorporating such elective changes would result in a delay in the schedule. Such additions and changes may lead to Change Orders, some of which may be Betterments.

 8.2.1 If requested elective changes are minor in nature and the STATE agrees to comply with the changes, SPU and the STATE will approve, in writing, the request by signing a "Minor Change Request and Approval Form," using the template shown as Exhibit B. SPU agrees to reimburse the STATE for the costs associated with the changes.

 9.2 If the STATE or its contractor fails to comply with a written notice to remedy what SPU determines to be an emergency situation, SPU may, but is not required to, have the non-conforming, unauthorized or Defective Work corrected immediately, have such work removed and replaced, or have work the STATE or its contractor refuses to correct completed. An emergency situation shall mean a condition that calls for immediate action to respond to danger to health, safety or property.

 9.3 Direct and indirect costs incurred by SPU attributable to correcting and remedying non-conforming, unauthorized or Defective Work, or work the STATE or its contractor failed or refused to perform, shall be paid by the STATE to SPU within thirty (30) days after receipt of an invoice with appropriate documentation of such costs.

 13.1 Upon completion of the SPU Facilities Work and upon SPU's acceptance of such work as outlined in Section 12 herein, and in compliance with all provisions of the SDOT Holgate to King Stage 2 Agreement Section 13 therein, the STATE shall transfer ownership of the SPU Facilities to SPU, shall warrant good title to the SPU Facilities constructed by the STATE, and shall transfer all right, title and interest it may have in the SPU Facilities to SPU. SPU shall be responsible for all future operation and maintenance of the SPU Facilities at its sole cost and expense, except that the STATE shall remain liable for any latent defects or warranty claims.

 13.2 In addition, for any design, permitting or construction of the SPU Facilities Work undertaken by the STATE, the STATE shall require its construction contractors to provide SPU with the following warranties, each of which shall be for a minimum of one year, unless the industry standard is longer: (1) any guaranty or warranty furnished as a normal trade practice in connection with the purchase (by the contractor or a subcontractor) of any equipment, materials or items incorporated in the SPU Facilities Work; and (2) the warranties as provided in Section 15 of the SDOT Holgate to King Stage 2 Agreement unless otherwise modified in this SPU Holgate to King Stage 2 Agreement.

 13.3 The warranty period shall commence on the date of the jointly executed Letter of Acceptance for the PROJECT, except that the warranties of the SPU Facilities Work performed by the contractor on SPU's storm drainage system shall commence pursuant to Section 13.4 of this SPU Holgate to King Stage 2 Agreement.

 13.4 In the event the STATE's contractor completes certain portions of SPU's storm drainage system prior to completion of the PROJECT, Section 13.4 and Section 13.5 of this SPU Holgate to King Stage 2 Agreement shall apply. Once a portion of the storm drainage system has been constructed in accordance with the requirements of the Approved Plans and all SPU- approved modifications to the Approved Plans, the STATE shall request inspection of the system as provided in Section 11 of this SPU Holgate to King Stage 2 Agreement. If the inspected portion complies with the requirements, SPU shall provide the STATE with written notification that such portion is operationally complete and the warranties for that portion of the storm drainage system shall commence. For the purposes of this section, operationally complete is the condition where SPU determines that a portion of the SPU storm drainage system has been constructed per the Approved Plans and all SPU-approved modifications to the Approved Plans, connected to an existing SPU mainline, and is otherwise able to function as part of the storm drainage system.

 13.5 At least thirty (30) Business Days prior to expiration of the storm drainage system warranties, the STATE shall invite SPU to inspect the completed portion of the storm drainage system per the provisions of Section 11.4 of this SPU Holgate to King Stage 2 Agreement. The STATE shall be responsible for correcting defects identified during this inspection. Upon expiration of the warranties, SPU shall be responsible for the costs of addressing failures of the operationally complete portion of the storm drainage system, including settlement and uplift. In accordance with Section 3.1.6 of this SPU Holgate to King Stage 2 Agreement, the STATE shall remain responsible for protecting the existing storm drainage system as well as the operationally complete portions, until completion of the PROJECT. As provided in Section 13.1 herein, the STATE shall remain liable for any latent defects discovered following expiration of the applicable warranties for the storm drainage system.

 14. ACQUISITION AND TRANSFER OF EASEMENTS

Notwithstanding termination of the Reservation, Grantor shall remain liable and responsible for all matters arising prior to termination of the Reservation with respect to the Grantee obligations under the Easement and shall indemnify, defend and hold Grantee harmless from and against such obligations.

 14.3 The legal descriptions will be determined by the Approved Plans at the time of advertisement of the PROJECT. The Parties acknowledge that due to unforeseen field conditions the location of one or more of the permanent easements may need to change after commencement of construction. In that case, the STATE shall provide SPU with documents, reports and information identified in Subsection 14.1 above, relevant to the new or modified easement area.
