 AGREEMENT

 regarding

 PURCHASE OF A RESTRICTIVE COVENANT AND EASEMENT IN GROSS

 AT THE RAINIER VISTA BOYS AND GIRLS CLUB

 THIS Agreement regarding Purchase of a Restrictive Covenant and Easement in Gross at the Rainier Vista Boys and Girls Club ("Agreement") is made and entered into by and between THE CITY OF SEATTLE ("the City"), a first class city of the State of Washington, acting by and through its Superintendent of the Department of Parks and Recreation ("Superintendent"), and the BOYS AND GIRLS CLUBS OF KING COUNTY, a Washington non-profit corporation (the "Boys and Girls Clubs") and RAINER VALLEY BOYS AND GIRLS CLUB, a Washington non- profit corporation ("RVBGC").

 I. PURPOSE OF AGREEMENT

 WHEREAS, the Boys and Girls Clubs is a non-profit organization founded in 1943 with a core mission of inspiring and enabling all young people to realize their full potential as productive, responsible and caring citizens; and

 WHEREAS, the Boys and Girls Clubs operates fourteen clubs in King County, including five in Seattle, and through the clubs offers programs for youth ages six through eighteen in five core areas: character and leadership development, education and career development, health and life skills, the arts, and sports/fitness/recreation; and

 WHEREAS, in 1976, at the request of the City of Seattle, the Seattle City Police, and the Seattle Housing Authority, the Boys and Girls Clubs established a Boys and Girls club at Rainier Vista in order to stem rising crime in the community by offering positive recreational and educational opportunities for youth; and

 WHEREAS, the Boys and Girls Clubs operated the club at Rainier Vista until 2007, when the Seattle Housing Authority demolished the building as part of the Hope VI redevelopment of Rainier Vista; and

 WHEREAS, while it was in operation, the club at Rainier Vista served some of the City of Seattle's most at-risk youth: ninety percent of the youth participants came from low-income families, thirty percent were in foster care, seventy-five percent came from single parent households, sixty-four percent of the youth in the area's schools qualified for the free/reduced lunch program, and twenty-two percent of the youth came from homes where English was not the first language; and

 WHEREAS, the need for recreational programs for children and youth in the Rainier Valley is expanding, and the Rainier Community Center is at capacity in its ability to serve recreational needs of local youth and children; and

 WHEREAS, the Boys and Girls Clubs formed the RVBGC as a subsidiary to own and operate a new facility that would serve as the new club for the neighborhood; and

 WHEREAS, the Seattle Housing Authority deeded to RVBGC more than two and a half acres of land in the Rainier Vista redevelopment area, and Boys and Girls Clubs has raised sufficient funds and has begun construction of the new Rainier Vista Boys and Girls Club (the "Rainier Vista Club") on the property; and

 WHEREAS, the Rainier Vista Club will be a 40,000 square foot facility that will include a special teen center comprising approximately 20,000 square feet of space for social services, outdoor playfield space, a computer lab, music room, after school programs, and other recreational opportunities for teens; and

 WHEREAS, that portion of the Rainier Vista Club that will house the teen center will also provide space that is suitable for community and recreational uses during school hours when the teenage youth programs are not in operation; and

 WHEREAS, the Department of Parks and Recreation's mission is "to provide safe and welcoming opportunities to play, learn, contemplate and build community"; and

 WHEREAS, the Superintendent has determined that the general public will benefit from programs that engage teenage youth in positive recreational, social, and educational activities, and that Parks can further its mission in the Rainier Valley Neighborhood by ensuring that the Rainier Vista Club will continue to operate as a recreational center for youth and teens for a guaranteed number of hours and years; and

 WHEREAS, in consideration of the foregoing, the City would like to purchase, and RVBGC would like to sell, a restrictive covenant and easement in gross that will ensure that the Rainier Vista Club includes a teen center that is operated for a significant period of time and will provide space for recreational activities, classes and community gatherings for both youth and the general public;

 Now therefore, in consideration of the foregoing, and the mutual benefits and covenants herein, the City and RVBGC and Boys and Girls Clubs agree as follows:

 The Grantors shall have sole responsibility for construction, maintenance, and operation of the Property and the Rainier Vista Club, including the Teen Center.

 7. DEPARTMENT OVERSIGHT/AUDIT

 The Department shall have the right to monitor and oversee the Grantors' compliance with the requirements and conditions of this Agreement.

 9. DAMAGE OR DESTRUCTION

 If the Property and/or the Rainier Vista Club shall be destroyed or damaged by fire or other casualty during the Term of this Agreement and when the Use Period has not yet commenced or has time remaining under the Easement granted herein, then Grantors shall restore or rebuild the Rainier Vista Club, including the Teen Center, if sufficient insurance proceeds are available, and the Use Rights granted pursuant to the Easement shall apply to the rebuilt or restored Property and/or Rainier Vista Club, and the Easement Term and Duration shall be extended by a period equal to the time that Use Rights under this Easement were not available. In the alternative, if the Rainier Vista Club and/or the Teen Center are not rebuilt or restored, or if such building or restoration does not commence within 24 months of the damage or destruction, then Grantors shall pay the City liquidated damages as described in Section 18.

 10.4 Neither the grant of Easement, nor any provision of this Agreement is in conflict with any provision of any other agreement or instrument by which Grantors are bound or to which the Property is subject (including but not limited to any debts that are secured by the Property), nor shall the execution, delivery or performance of this Agreement and the Easement constitute an event of default under any such agreement or instrument.

 11. TRANSFER, LEASE, RENTAL, OR PERMISSION FOR USE OF FACILITY

 If the Grantors transfer the Property, or lease, rent, or otherwise permit any person to use the Rainier Vista Club in any manner whatsoever, Grantors shall remain bound by this Agreement and the Easement and shall not be released from any of Grantors' obligations hereunder without the express prior written consent of the City to release Grantor, which the City may withhold or grant in its sole discretion.

 12. RECORDING AND PRIORITY

 The Easement shall be duly recorded with King County. Grantors warrant and covenant that they shall not record or grant any lien rights or encumbrances after the date of this Agreement that are or claim to be superior in right to the Easement. The City accepts monetary liens and use restrictions encumbering the Property that will not be subordinate to the Easement as reported on Exhibit C; provided however, that prior to Closing, Grantors shall provide the City with a signed agreement from Community Development Funding VIII, LLC subordinating its interests in the Property to the extent necessary to ensure that the City's restrictive covenant and use rights will not be extinguished in the event of foreclosure.

 13. NONDISCRIMINATION

 Grantors shall comply, and cause all contractors and subcontractors working on the Property to comply, with all applicable equal employment opportunity and nondiscrimination laws of the United States, the State of Washington, and the City of Seattle, including but not limited to Chapters 14.04, 14.10, and 20.42 of the Seattle Municipal Code (SMC), to the extent applicable, and rules, regulations, orders, and directives of the associated administrative agencies and their officers.

 14. JOINT AND SEVERAL OBLIGATIONS

 The obligations of Grantors hereunder shall be the joint and several obligations of Boys and Girls Clubs and RVBGC.

 15. DEFAULT BY GRANTORS

 15.1 If Grantors fail to perform when required any obligation or breach any term of this Agreement or the Easement, the City may provide written notice to Grantors, specifying the nature of the breach and the reasonable number of days (but in any event the City shall not be required to allow more than ninety (90) days) after the date of the notice within which such breach must be cured. If the breach is not susceptible of a cure within the time period specified by the City, Grantors will not be in breach so long as they commence a cure within the time allowed for cure and diligently pursue the cure to completion. Unless Grantors shall fully cure, or demonstrate that they are making a good-faith effort to cure, all breaches specified in such notice within the time allowed Grantors shall be in Default.

 15.2 In case of Default by Grantors, the City may exercise remedies as specified in Section 18, or specified under any applicable provision of the Easement. In addition to or in lieu of the foregoing, the City shall be entitled to all remedies permitted from time to time by the laws of the State of Washington. The City's rights and remedies hereunder are not exclusive, but cumulative, and the City's exercise of any right or remedy due to Grantor's failure to perform any covenant or condition of this Agreement shall not be deemed a waiver of, or alter, affect, or prejudice any other right or remedy that the City may have under this Agreement or by law or in equity.

 16. DEFAULT BY CITY AND REMEDIES

 If, within 30 days after Grantor shall have timely satisfied all conditions to the City's obligation for payment hereunder, the City shall not have tendered to Grantor full payment hereunder, then Grantor may either (1) terminate this Agreement by written notice to the City within 30 days, in which case neither party shall have any liability or obligation hereunder; or (2) pursue any remedy available at law or in equity for enforcement of this Agreement, provided that the City shall not be liable for damages or any other monetary remedy in excess of the total price stated hereunder, plus interest as may be allowed by law.

 17. TERMINATION

 17.1 This Agreement shall survive the execution and delivery of the Easement and shall continue in effect until the earliest to occur of:

 (i) termination by Grantors pursuant to paragraph 16 above;

 (ii) the expiration of the Easement Term or earlier termination thereof pursuant to the terms of the Easement; or

 (ii) if the Grantee elects to claim liquidated damages after Default in accordance with Section 18 hereof, the date on which Grantee receives full payment of all liquidated damages.

 17.2 The City may terminate this Agreement in the event that, prior to payment by the City hereunder, Grantor is in Default, or the City, in its reasonable discretion, determines that Grantor will be unable to timely complete the construction of the Rainier Vista Club.

 18. LIQUIDATED DAMAGES

 18.1 The parties understand and agree that the City's ability to obtain value from the Easement granted is conditioned upon the development and construction of the Property and the completion, opening, and availability for use and occupancy of the Rainier Vista Club and the Teen Center. From the nature of this Agreement, it would be impracticable and extremely difficult to fix the actual damages sustained as a result of the failure of the Grantor to complete or make available the portions of the Property subject to the Easement, or sustained as a result of Grantors' use of the Property for purposes contrary to the terms of the Easement. As a result, the parties agree that in the circumstances expressly set forth in this section and other applicable sections of this Agreement, the City shall have the right to recover, at its option, liquidated damages in the amounts set forth herein, which amounts the parties agree are a reasonable estimate of the damage to the City,  and are intended to fairly measure the loss to the City and not to be punitive in nature.

 18.2 In the event of Default prior to the completion of the Rainier Vista Club, or in the event that the Use Period does not commence, Grantor agrees to pay the City on demand liquidated damages in the amount equal to the total purchase money City has paid to Grantor, plus interest. Interest shall accrue from the date City pays Grantor until the date of full repayment at the rate applied during the same period of time to the participating funds of the Consolidated Cash Portfolio of the City of Seattle.

 18.3 In the event of Default after the beginning of the Use Period and prior to the expiration of the Use Period, Grantor agrees to pay the City on demand liquidated damages in the amount of FIVE THOUSAND, FIVE HUNDRED FIFTY SIX AND NO/100 DOLLARS ($5,556) for each month of the remaining Use Period, plus interest calculated as described in 18.2 above.

 18.4 Consistent with Section 14, Grantors shall be jointly and severally liable for any liquidated damages that the City may be entitled to under the terms of this Agreement. Any future sale or transfer of the Property shall not extinguish Boys and Girls Clubs' obligations hereunder, nor shall it impair the City's ability to pursue liquidated damages from either Boys and Girls Clubs or RVBGC.

 18.5 After receipt of liquidated damages in cleared funds, the City shall, within a reasonable time, record an instrument terminating the Easement, and this Agreement shall be terminated.

 18.6 The City may, at its option, set off any liquidated damages under this Section against any amount otherwise payable or distributable by the City to Grantors, whether or not in relation to this Agreement or the Property.

 19. COMPLIANCE WITH LAW; INDEMNITY

 19.1 Grantors shall comply at their sole expense with all applicable laws of the United States and the State of Washington; the Charter, Municipal Code, and ordinances of The City of Seattle; and rules, regulations, orders, and directives of their administrative agencies and the officers thereof (all of the foregoing are referred to as "applicable laws"). Grantors shall require all contractors and subcontractors working on the Property to comply with all applicable laws.

 19.2 Grantors represent and warrant that any activities in connection with the development of the Property prior to this Agreement have been in compliance with all applicable laws.

 19.3 Grantors shall defend and indemnify the City and its officers and employees from and against any claim, demand, liability, or loss resulting from the failure of Grantors or of any contractor or subcontractor to comply with applicable laws.

 19.4 This Section 19 shall survive termination of this Agreement.

 20. APPLICABLE LAW; VENUE

 This Agreement shall be construed and interpreted in accordance with the laws of the State of Washington. The venue of any action brought hereunder shall be in the Superior Court for King County.

 21. HEADINGS

 The headings used in this Agreement are for convenience only and do not define or limit the contents.

 22. NOTICES AND REPORTS

 Any notices or reports required or permitted hereunder shall be effective when hand-delivered during normal business hours or two (2) business days after mailed, postage prepaid, to a party at the addresses set forth below, or to such other address as a party shall designate in writing in accordance with this Section.

 3.2 Grantor covenants and agrees that throughout the full duration of the Use Period, Grantor shall make the Teen Center programs publicly accessible and available to all youth of appropriate age either free of charge or for a nominal membership fee comparable to the fees the Department charges for similar programs and facilities.

 3.3 Grantor covenants and agrees that in the event the Grantor wishes to relocate the Teen Center to another area of the Property during the term of this Easement, Grantor guarantees that the area will be equivalent to the area shown on Attachment B in both size and quality, and that the operation of the Teen Center shall remain substantially the same. Additionally, Grantor covenants that it will not make any use of any other area of the Property that will prevent or impair the operation of the Teen Center.

 3.4 Grantor may implement procedures and guidelines for use of the Teen Center, including codes of conduct, so long as the procedures and guidelines are for the purpose of ensuring equitable access to the Teen Center programs, safety of participants and the general public, protection of the Teen Center and other portions of the Property, and so long as such rules and guidelines are uniformly applied and do not result in unreasonable restrictions upon youth or public access to the Teen Center.

 3.4 Grantor is solely responsible for maintaining, managing, and operating the Property and the Teen Center according to its own discretion, subject to the terms of this Easement. The Grantor shall maintain the Property and the Teen Center in good condition and repair, and in compliance with all applicable laws, codes, permits, and regulations.

Grantor reserves the right to determine which portions of the facility will be available for public use in fulfillment of this requirement.

 4.2 For the public access secured by this Easement in Gross, Grantor may charge Community Users a use fee that is reasonably calculated to reimburse Grantor for its actual operating costs and building maintenance.

 4.3 Grantor may establish procedures that guide use, including times of operation, the availability of the Rainier Vista Boys and Girls Club, codes of conduct, and other policies necessary to efficiently and fairly operate the Property. Grantor may require that Community Users enter a use agreement provided that the use agreement does not impair or unreasonably restrict the Use Rights granted herein, and such agreement is designed to ensure safe and equitable access to the Rainier Vista Boys and Girls Club, to limit damage to the Rainier Vista Boys and Girls Club, and to limit Grantor's risk in operating and managing the Property.

 4.4 Grantor is solely responsible for maintaining, managing, and operating the Rainier Vista Boys and Girls Club according to its own discretion, subject to the terms of this Easement. The Grantor shall maintain the Club in good condition and repair, and in compliance with all applicable laws, codes, permits, and regulations.

 5. Indemnity

 Grantor shall have control over and responsibility for the development, operation, and maintenance of the Property, including the Teen Center, the Club, and the services and programs provided at the Property.

This clause applies to claims, liabilities, costs, losses, and/or damages of any kind notwithstanding any acts, omissions, or negligence of the City or its officers, officials, employees, contractors, or agents; provided, that nothing herein shall be construed as requiring Grantor to indemnify the City against liability for bodily injury or damage to property caused by or resulting from the sole negligence of the City or of any of its officers, elected officials, employees, or agents, and further provided, that if RCW 4.24.115 (or successor provision) shall apply to any claim for any such damage or injury, then to the extent required by such statute, (1) this indemnity shall not apply in case of any liability for damages arising out of bodily injury to persons or damage to property caused or resulting from the sole negligence of the City, its agents or employees, and (2) in case of liability for damages arising out of bodily injury to persons or damage to property caused by or resulting from the concurrent negligence of (a) the City or its agents or employees, and (b) Grantor or its agents or employees, this indemnity shall apply only to the extent of Grantor's negligence. The indemnification obligation set forth in this section shall survive the expiration or earlier termination of this Easement.
