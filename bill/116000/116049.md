 ORDINANCE _________________

 AN ORDINANCE authorizing the Director of Finance, or the Director's designee, to execute a Second Amendment to the Lease and Concession Agreement between the City of Seattle and BH Music Center.

 WHEREAS, the City and the Seattle Symphony Orchestra, a Washington nonprofit corporation ("Symphony"), executed a Master Agreement in October 1995, which was amended by a First Amendment executed in June 1996 (together, the "Amended Master Agreement"). The Amended Master Agreement provided for the development and construction of a new downtown concert hall for primary use by the Symphony and detailed the terms under which the parties would cooperate to finance and construct the new facility. In September 1996, the Symphony, with the City's approval, assigned its interests under the Amended Master Agreement and the related Design and Construction Agreements to the BH Music Center ("BHMC"); and

 WHEREAS, in September 1997, the City and BHMC executed a Lease & Concession Agreement (the "1997 Agreement"), pursuant to which the City leased to BHMC the facility to be constructed under the Amended Master Agreement. In August 1998, the City and BHMC executed a First Amendment to & Restatement of the Lease and Concession Agreement (the "1998 Amendment and Restatement"), which amended and restated the 1997 Agreement (the 1997 Agreement, as amended and restated by the 1998 Amendment and Restatement, the "Agreement"); and

 WHEREAS, pursuant to the Amended Master Agreement and the Agreement, City issued its Concert Hall Bonds (as such term is defined in Section 5.E of the Agreement) and paid from the proceeds thereof a portion of the cost of acquiring and constructing the new facility. The City later elected to refinance certain of the Concert Hall Bonds at a more favorable interest rate. It always has been the City's and BHMC's understanding that the present value of BHMC's Concession Payments for additional parking financed by the City would be equal to the present value of the City's debt service for that additional parking. Therefore, the City intends to make available to BHMC the present value of the savings in debt service costs realized by the City as a result of the refinancing by suspending for the period beginning August 1, 2007 and ending July 31, 2013, the Concession Payments that would otherwise be due and payable under Section 9.A of the Agreement with respect to such period; and

 WHEREAS, in July 2005, the City and BHMC agreed that the amount to be deposited annually by BHMC into the Capital Renewal Fund (as defined in Section 16.A of the Agreement) pursuant to Section 16.B of the Agreement would, as of such date, be reduced from $245,000 to $150,000. The original amount was an estimate only and the new amount is based upon actual costs and the current capital replacement schedule. No formal amendment was entered into by the City and BHMC to memorialize this modification to the Agreement but, since July 1, 2005, BHMC has deposited annually into the Capital Renewal Fund the amount of $150,000; and

 WHEREAS, in November 2006, the City and BHMC agreed that the Base Amount to be reimbursed by the City under Section 11.D of the Agreement for the actual annual expenses incurred in carrying out Garden of Remembrance maintenance and operations obligations pursuant to Section 15 of the Agreement was to be increased as of July 1, 2007 from $60,000 to $120,000. The original amount was an estimate only and the new amount is based upon actual costs. No formal amendment was entered into by the City and BHMC to memorialize this modification to the Agreement but it was approved by the Mayor and City Council through adoption of the 2007 budget; NOW, THEREFORE,

 BE IT ORDAINED BY THE CITY OF SEATTLE AS FOLLOWS:

 Section 1. The Director of Finance, or the Director's designee, is authorized to sign and execute the Second Amendment to the Lease and Concession Agreement between the City of Seattle and BH Music Center, substantially in the form of Attachment 1, to be effective as of August 1, 2007.

 TO

 LEASE AND CONCESSION AGREEMENT

 THIS SECOND AMENDMENT TO LEASE AND CONCESSION AGREEMENT (this "Amendment") is entered into this ___ day of __________, 2007, but shall be deemed effective as of the 1st day of August, 2007, by and between THE CITY OF SEATTLE ("City"), a city of the first class in the State of Washington, and BH MUSIC CENTER ("Tenant"), a Washington non-profit corporation.

 RECITALS

 A. City and the Seattle Symphony Orchestra, a Washington nonprofit corporation ("Symphony"), executed a Master Agreement in October 1995, which was amended by a First Amendment executed in June 1996 (together, the "Amended Master Agreement"). The Amended Master Agreement provided for the development and construction of a new downtown concert hall for primary use by the Symphony and detailed the terms under which the parties would cooperate to finance and construct the new facility. In September 1996, the Symphony, with City's approval, assigned its interests under the Amended Master Agreement and the related Design and Construction Agreements to Tenant.

 B. In September 1997, City and Tenant executed a Lease & Concession Agreement (the "1997 Agreement"), pursuant to which City leased to Tenant the facility to be constructed under the Amended Master Agreement. In August 1998, City and Tenant executed a First Amendment to & Restatement of the Lease and Concession Agreement (the "First Amendment and Restatement"), which amended and restated the 1997 Agreement (the 1997 Agreement, as amended and restated by the First Amendment and Restatement, the "Agreement").

 C. Pursuant to the Amended Master Agreement and the Agreement, City issued its Concert Hall Bonds (as such term is defined in Section 5.E of the Agreement) and paid from the proceeds thereof a portion of the cost of acquiring and constructing the new facility. City later elected to refinance certain of the Concert Hall Bonds at a more favorable interest rate. It always has been the City's and the Tenant's agreement that the present value of the Tenant's payment for additional parking financed by the City would be equal to the present value of the City's debt service for that additional parking. Therefore, the City has agreed to make available to Tenant the savings in debt service costs realized by City as a result of such refinancing by suspending for the period beginning August 1, 2007 and ending July 31, 2013, the Concession Payments that would otherwise be due and payable under Section 9.A of the Agreement with respect to such period.

 D. In July 2005, City and Tenant agreed that the amount to be deposited annually by Tenant into the Capital Renewal Fund (as defined in Section 16.A of the Agreement) pursuant to Section 16.B of the Agreement would, as of such date, be reduced from Two Hundred Forty Five Thousand Dollars ($245,000) to One Hundred Fifty Thousand Dollars ($150,000). The original amount was an estimate only; and the new amount is based upon actual costs and the current capital replacement schedule. No formal amendment was entered into by City and Tenant to memorialize this modification to the Agreement but, since July 1, 2005, Tenant has deposited annually into the Capital Renewal Fund the amount of One Hundred Fifty Thousand Dollars ($150,000).

 E. In January 2007, City and Tenant agreed that the Base Amount to be reimbursed by City under Section 11.D of the Agreement in respect of Tenant's actual annual expenses incurred in carrying out Garden of Remembrance maintenance and operations obligations pursuant to Section 15 of the Agreement was to be increased as of January 1, 2007 from Sixty Thousand Dollars ($60,000) to One Hundred Twenty Thousand Dollars ($120,000). The original amount was an estimate only; and the new amount is based upon actual costs. No formal amendment was entered into by City and Tenant to memorialize this modification to the Agreement but, since January 1, 2007, City has made its monthly reimbursement of Tenant's annual expenses incurred in carrying out Garden of Remembrance maintenance and operations obligations using a Base Amount of One Hundred Twenty Thousand Dollars ($120,000).

 F. City and Tenant now desire to enter into this Amendment in order to amend the Agreement to effectuate the modification described in Recital C above and to memorialize and ratify the modifications already in effect as described in Recitals D and E above.
