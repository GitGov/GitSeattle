 AN ORDINANCE related to the City's Broadband Initiative; amending a budget proviso that restricts spending of the amount appropriated in the 2008 Adopted Budget in the Department of Information Technology's Office of Electronic Communications Budget Control Level.

 WHEREAS, the City, through the Department of Information Technology (DoIT), has been evaluating options for increasing competitive choice and bandwidth capacity of broadband services in Seattle since 2004; and

 WHEREAS, the City's Task Force on Telecommunications Innovation, established in 2004 pursuant to Resolution 30684, released a report in 2005 which concluded that a fiber to the premises (FTTP) network is the only access network capable of meeting the goal adopted by the Task Force of true broadband connectivity for all Seattle residents by 2015; and

 WHEREAS, at the direction of the Mayor and pursuant to the Mayor's Broadband Initiative, DoIT issued a Request for Interest (RFI) and arranged for a consultant to prepare a financial feasibility study for a new FTTP network in Seattle; and

 WHEREAS, as a next step for the Broadband Initiative, the Mayor has requested that DoIT issue a Request for Proposal (RFP) to private organizations interested in participating in the development of a FTTP network in Seattle; and

 WHEREAS, DoIT presented a progress report to the City Council's Energy & Technology Committee in December 2007, in accordance with the City Council's budget guidance statement, outlining the results of the consultant's financial feasibility study for the Broadband Initiative; and

 WHEREAS, the 2008 Adopted Budget provides $213,461 in DoIT's Office of Electronic Communications Budget Control Level to fund two (2) positions that were added by the City Council in 2006 for the Broadband Initiative but have not been filled; and

 WHEREAS, in adopting the 2008 budget, the City Council approved Green Sheet 92-1-A-2, thereby imposing a budget proviso restricting expenditure of the $213,461 appropriation in DoIT's 2008 Adopted Budget until authorized by a future ordinance; and

 WHEREAS, the City Council stated its intent to authorize expenditure of the 2008 Broadband Initiative funds after DoIT submits a proposal to the City Council for moving forward on the Broadband Initiative, and the City Council reviews the proposal and gives its direction; and

 WHEREAS, DoIT submits a proposal with this legislation entitled "Broadband Initiative: Next Steps (2008)" (attached hereto as Attachment A) which describes its plan to develop a RFP to be published by 3rd Quarter of 2008 and includes estimated costs; and

 WHEREAS, DoIT wishes to use $185,000 of the $213,461 appropriation in DoIT's 2008 Adopted Budget to develop the RFP and evaluate responses; and

 WHEREAS, the City Council has reviewed the Broadband Initiative proposal and concurs with the plan to move forward to develop an RFP; and

 WHEREAS, the City Council believes that a wireless network may hold promise for providing broadband connectivity in Seattle, and therefore has requested that DoIT develop an RFP for a new FTTP network or a new wireless network or a hybrid of the two; and

 WHEREAS, the City Council wants the opportunity to review and comment on policy issues; NOW, THEREFORE,

 BE IT ORDAINED BY THE CITY OF SEATTLE AS FOLLOWS:

 Section 1. The restriction imposed by the following budget proviso as adopted by Ordinance 122560 is amended as follows:

 Department Green Sheet # BCL Name / Code Department of Information Technology 92-1-A-2 Office of Electronic Communications / D4402

 "$213,461 of the money appropriated for 2008 for the Department of Information Technology's (DoIT's) Office of Electronic Communications BCL may not be spent to fund new positions for the Broadband Initiative until authorized by a future ordinance; however, an amount up to $185,000 may be used to develop a request for proposal (RFP) for a new FTTP network in Seattle or a new wireless network in Seattle or a hybrid FTTP and wireless network, and evaluate responses as described in DoIT's report entitled Broadband Initiative: Next Steps (2008) (with the addition of consideration of a wireless network), provided that DoIT shall consult with the Council prior to issuing the RFP affording an opportunity for Council review and comment on policy issues. Council anticipates that ~~such~~the authority to spend more than allowed in this proviso will not be granted until DoIT provides a report on the RFP results and submits a proposal to the Council for moving forward on the Broadband Initiative, and the Council reviews the proposal and gives direction."

 Section 2. The Council intends that DoIT hire one or more consultants as outlined in its report entitled Broadband Initiative: Next Steps (2008) to assist in drafting an RFP. The Council requests that DoIT present the draft RFP to the Energy and Technology Committee before it is issued so that Councilmembers can review the policy issues reflected in the draft RFP and comment on them. In particular, the Council will review any proposed provisions in the draft RFP that pertain to the use of City assets and the conditions under which such assets may be used. This review will also provide an opportunity for Councilmembers to confirm that issuing an RFP is the appropriate next step to improve broadband access for Seattle residents, businesses, and institutions.

 Section 3. This ordinance shall take effect and be in force thirty (30) days from and after its approval by the Mayor, but if not approved and returned by the Mayor within ten (10) days after presentation, it shall take effect as provided by Municipal Code Section 1.04.020.

 Attachment A: Report to the Council entitled "Broadband Initiative: Next Steps (2008)"

 City of Seattle Gregory J. Nickels, Mayor Department of Information Technology Bill Schrier, Director and Chief Technology Officer

 Date: February 14, 2008 (corrected April 15, 2008)

 To: Seattle City Councilmembers

 CC: Regina La Belle; Erin Devoto; Tony Perez

 From: Bill Schrier, Chief Technology Officer Department of Information Technology

 Subject: Broadband Initiative: Next Steps (2008)

 This memo provides Council with a brief history and overview of the Fiber Broadband Initiative,

 outlines the next steps, and provides a general timeline and approximate costs for completing the Broadband Request for Proposal (RFP) process as directed by the Mayor.

 In preparation for the Comcast franchise renewal process during 2004, the Office of Cable Communications convened a panel of telecom experts to explore recent advances in broadband communications. The goal was to ensure that the City be positioned to exploit opportunities in emerging technologies and retain its standing as a technology leader. Shortly thereafter, the Mayor and City Council adopted Resolution No. 30684 creating the Taskforce on Telecommunications Innovation "to explore and report on the feasibility of using City resources in a network available to the public". Such a network would provide Internet, television and voice service and a platform for other future applications.

 1. Actions Taken to Date

 A. Taskforce report, May 2005

 The report highlighted eight recommendations ranging from "...the City working with private companies to encourage development by the private sector..." to recommending that "City government needs to lead the way and encourage the development of a robust broadband network if the City is to have the broadband infrastructure it needs." The report found a truly long-term, robust, broadband network requires a network of fiber optic cable to each home or business. The report also found Seattle to have little choice in telecommunications and cable. Only two major service providers (Qwest and Comcast) exist and they are essentially a duopoly with little competition and little incentive (or in Qwest's case, ability) to innovate. Consequently, there are high prices for businesses and consumers in Seattle, not unlike other areas of the country.

 B. Request for Interest, April 2006 - October 2006

 Pursuant to the Mayor's Broadband Initiative, DoIT advertised a process to attract interested developers. Twenty-eight companies responded and 11 of those were invited to a discussion regarding their ideas for developing a fiber network in Seattle. The firms indicated that the City's non-cash assets (e.g., poles, permitting, land, and population) were of value to a developer interested in building a network, and they were also interested in the possibility of using City Light's substations as nodes. While all firms suggested that the City should commit to being an anchor tenant in a fiber network to attract private developers, others suggested that some level of City funding would be necessary to signal the City's commitment to go forward and perhaps help secure private financing on more attractive terms. None of the firms indicated what size of investment would be necessary by the City.

 Incumbent providers (Qwest, Comcast, and Millennium) have indicated that they are not interested in making significant investments to upgrade their networks to fiber broadband in Seattle. Other private firms will not make the investment in Seattle because they do not want to take on the incumbent providers. Other cities throughout the U.S. either have incumbents who are willing to make the investment such as Verizon in Kirkland, Everett, Redmond, and Woodinville, or the cities themselves are making the investments because the electric utilities find a benefit in doing so.

 C. Completed Market Feasibility Study, May 2007

 The consultant contacted 384 residents by phone. Questions were asked about telephone usage, cable providers and internet service. Not surprisingly, respondents want competition, lower prices, and better service.

 D. Completed Financial Feasibility Study, May 2007

 As a follow up, in 2007 DoIT completed a financial feasibility study to explore the potential profitability of a fiber broadband network in Seattle and to assess the capital commitment required. Among the findings: the cost to build a fiber broadband network available to all in Seattle would be approximately $250M with an additional $250M to connect every home and business to the network.

 2. Executive Direction

 The Mayor directed DoIT to issue a RFP to solicit proposals from private parties interested in developing a fiber broadband network in Seattle. The RFP will be published in 3rd quarter of 2008. Evaluation of responses and recommendations will be completed by 4th quarter of 2008.

 For several reasons, the RFP process was the best of several options ranging from doing nothing to full City financing:

 * The costs to build the network are very high. The City should not place its financial capital at risk particularly as the development of fiber broadband networks is in its infant stages and few successful models exist.

 * The RFI indicated that there is significant interest among private providers in using the City's non-cash assets to the extent legally and practically possible. It is worth knowing if the private sector can leverage these assets and other resources to bring competition to Seattle.

 * The RFP will send a signal to the private sector that the City wants competition and is doing everything that it can to create a favorable climate for private investment.

 * The costs for developing an RFP are reasonable (see below).

 Requirements of the project and the extent of the City's participation will be identified during the RFP development process. It is expected that several firms or consortia will present compelling proposals that would lead to serious discussions about how best to develop a competitive fiber broadband network in Seattle.

 3. Next Steps and Required Funding

 To publish a RFP for a FTTP network by the 3rd quarter 2008, DoIT will complete the steps outlined in Table I below. Due to the level and specialized nature of the work, consultants will be needed. DoIT estimates that approximately $185,000 will be required. As per the accompanying legislation lifting the Council proviso, DoIT needs to reprogram salary savings from the two unfilled Broadband positions towards development of the RFP. The two positions will be required only in the event that the RFP is successful.

 Next Steps Timeframe Estimated Costs

 A. Identify, quantify and assign cost values (1Q - 3Q) Approximately for City assets available for this network: $40- $60k will Determine which assets can be used. For be needed for example, City Light conduit, SPU water consultant crossings, existing fiber owned by the Fiber assistance (240 Partnership, etc. hrs @ $250/hr)

 Determine the conditions, both practical and legal, under which the City's assets may be used and calculate the value of those assets in the context of the telecommunications market.

 B. Address Legal Issues: There are a number of (1Q - 4Q) We estimate legal issues that relate to the Broadband that up to $70k Initiative. We will need to retain outside may be counsel for much of this work due to the required. specialized nature of telecommunications law. (Approximately 230 hrs @ $300/hr)

 C. Permitting Facilitation: (2Q-3Q) $5k for Consultant 1. Identify existing permitting processes and assistance(20 define what hrs @ $250/hr) a competitor would need to do to build a working with city-wide fiber DoIT staff and network. Identify potential cost and time staff from involved. relevant 2. Obtain any recommendations on how to departments streamline the process.

 3. Obtain buy in from respective departments

 D. RFP: Develop/Issue/Evaluate Responses/Make (2Q-4Q) Approximately Recommendations $50k (200 hrs. @ $250/hr) Other RFP Development Tasks: * Technical analysis of proposed network architecture * Create summaries of engineering and market data * Contracting staff time * Developing submission requirements

 RFP Advertising/Bid Analysis: * Evaluation and selection criteria * Selection process * Evaluation of proposals * Interviews * Recommendations
