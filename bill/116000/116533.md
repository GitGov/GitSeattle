Statements of numerical goals or outcomes are for the purpose of measuring the success of programs and policies and do not impose a legal obligation on the City to achieve the intended results.

They will also receive training on how to take care of their child, budgeting, cooking skills, management skills regarding transitioning to having their own apartment.

 This expansion will allow the agency to generate additional revenues to support their programs.

 # of jobs, full or part time, created or retained (permanent, construction, or temporary)

 Approximately 3 construction jobs will be created by this project.

 Activity Name

 Jewish Family Service Food Bank Expansion (1601 16th Avenue, Seattle, WA 98122)

 Activity Description

 This project expands and relocates the Morris Polack Food Bank at Jewish Family Service. Expansion has grown increasingly necessary as food bank use has more than doubled over the last three years. The project renovates of a portion of the lower floor of an existing office building. The proposed renovation area is approximately 2,600 square feet and involves interior alteration to existing offices, storage and distribution area.

 CDBG-R dollar amount: $500,000

 Eligibility category: 570.201(c) Public Facilities

 National objective citation: 570.208(a)(2)(A) Presumed Benefit

 Other ARRA funds: $0

 Total Activity budget: $500,000

 Contract award within 120 days: Yes

 Infrastructure investment? No

 Maximization of job creation and economic benefit:

 This project directly assists those most impacted by the recession. The project increases both efficiency and effectiveness of the food bank. Food storage/ delivery capacity will be increased perhaps as much as 100%, enabling the food bank to accept significantly more food donation. This will reduce or eliminate the current need for off-site warehouse space and the periodic transportation costs (trucking food from the warehouse to the food bank). In addition, the new space allows for staging areas which may be used to have frequent (at least quarterly) food collections resulting in (estimated) 40,000 pounds of free food from community focused food collections. As numbers served increase, so does the portion of additional free food from our food bank partners such as Food Lifeline and Northwest Harvest. Increased capacity in ability to serve clients as well as an increased capacity to accept, warehouse and distribute food will in turn potentially leverage donor interest creating new revenue for JFS.

 The expansion will allow for up to two more permanent food bank positions to be created.

 # of jobs, full or part time, created or retained (permanent, construction, or temporary)

 Two permanent, plus 12 construction jobs.

 Activity Name

 Pike Market Child Care and Preschool (1501 Pike Place #213, Seattle, WA 98101)

 Activity Description

 This project renovates and expands the Pike Market Child Care & Preschool, originally built in 1982. It will increase the size of the child care and preschool from 5,200 square feet to 10,200 square feet and bring child care facility up to code requirements, thereby increasing the number of low- and moderate-income families served by the program. When complete, the school will have five classrooms, an infant room, a kitchen, a library, a staff lounge / teacher workroom, and administrative offices. This project will add space for 10 new children.

 CDBG-R dollar amount: $250,000

 Eligibility category: 570.201(c) Public Facilities

 National objective citation: 570.208(a)(2) Low- and moderate persons limited clientele

 Other ARRA funds: $0

 Total Activity budget: $1,968,334

 Contract award within 120 days: Yes

 Infrastructure investment? No

 Maximization of job creation and economic benefit:

 The project serves those most impacted by the recession by increasing affordable child care space in the downtown Seattle core, thus making it easier for lower income families to secure employment. Among the effects on the Preschool project are 1) all the windows will be replaced; and 2) the Market's new central power water-loop system will offer significantly better heating and cooling. The Preschool project will qualify for a LEED Silver certification.

 It is expected that the new windows and HVAC system will potentially decrease the Preschool's utility bills. The primary savings will be in efficiencies created by having the entire school on a single floor. Being on one floor will enable classrooms to share supplies and studio areas.

 This project is expected to create 15 construction-related jobs for the Preschool's renovation work for up to 6 months. When completed, the expansion space will allow the school to hire 3 additional, permanent teachers.

 # of jobs, full or part time, created or retained (permanent, construction, or temporary)

 15 construction related jobs for up to 6 months, and 3 permanent jobs thereafter.

 SCIDpda Congregate Meal Program Site Expansion & Renovation (409 Maynard Ave S. Suite P-6, Seattle, WA 98104)

 Activity Description

 This project will reconfigure the space to increase efficiency of space utilization, allowing the program to serve meals to a greater number of low-income seniors. Funds will support work related to moving the kitchen and related plumbing, electrical, fire system, kitchen hood and HVAC systems. The project will include installing new ceiling, lighting system, wall covering, flooring and color scheme. Funds will also be used to upgrade the electrical system to meet needs for future audio/visual equipment and computers used by clients. Finally, SCIDpda intends to create more storage areas and built-in cabinetry for furniture (folding tables and chairs), audio/visual equipment and computer stations.

 CDBG-R dollar amount: $166,000

 Maximization of job creation and economic benefit:

 The program's elderly clients rely on their families as their support systems. As these families are impacted by the recession, the elderly clients also struggle. Families are working harder and tightening budgets. Therefore, there is more reliance on the Congregate Meal Program to help provide a regular nutritious meal and socialization activities for clients.

 We anticipate there will be a greater need for congregate meal programs over the next couple of years. Many individuals are discovering their shrinking retirement funds or current fixed incomes are not sufficient. By creating a more efficient facility, the agency will strongly consider starting a dinner program, with which they hope to serve more individuals in need.

 The renovated space will also allow the agency to rent the space out to other meal programs, thus maximizing the available space for the community and providing income for the program.

 # of jobs, full or part time, created or retained (permanent, construction, or temporary)

 1 - 2 FTE positions may be created with the new dinner program. Construction jobs will also be funded.

 Timeliness of Proposed Activities:

 In choosing these activities and projects for CDBG-R funding, the City carefully reviewed the ability of each proposed project and project sponsor to meet the priority of being under contract within 120 calendar days from the date funds are made available to the City. Because of a long history of continuous staff contacts with and assistance to a wide range of community-based agencies and affordable housing providers, a short list of possible CDBG-R community facilities and affordable housing projects was quickly developed. Aside from basic CDBG eligibility screening, information was gleaned from the agencies and other sources to ascertain whether or not they would meet the 120 day priority. Information included:

 * Status of project funding

 * Project permitting status and issues

 * Agency capacity to undertake the project in a timely manner

 * Existence or absence of environmental or historic review issues

 * Project self-described timeline

 * Completeness of architectural and engineering work.

 Taking these and other relevant issues into consideration, City staff determined that the projects contained in this proposal can be initiated within 120 days of February 17, 2009.
