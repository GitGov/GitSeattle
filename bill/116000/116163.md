 AGREEMENT

 BY AND BETWEEN

 THE CITY OF SEATTLE

 AND

 WASHINGTON STATE COUNCIL OF COUNTY AND CITY EMPLOYEES

 ________________________________________

 THIS AGREEMENT is between the City of Seattle (hereinafter called the "City") and the Washington State Council of County and City Employees, Local 21P (hereinafter called the "Union") for the purpose of setting forth the mutual understanding of the parties as to wages, hours, and other conditions of employment of those employees for whom the City has recognized the Union as the collective bargaining representative.

 Whenever words denoting gender are used in this Agreement, they are intended to apply equally to either gender.

 NONDISCRIMINATION

 The City and the Union agree that they will not unlawfully discriminate against any employee by reason of race, color, age, sex, marital status, sexual orientation, political ideology, creed, religion, ancestry, national origin, or the presence of any sensory, mental, or physical handicap, unless based on a bona fide occupational qualification to the extent allowed by applicable law.

 ARTICLE 1 - RECOGNITION AND BARGAINING UNIT

 1.1 The City hereby recognizes the respective Union as the exclusive collective bargaining representative for the purposes stated in Chapter 108, Extra Session, Laws of 1967 of the State of Washington, of all regular full-time, part-time, and temporary parking enforcement officers employed by the City of Seattle (hereinafter, "employees" or "PEOs").

 1.2 The terms temporary employee and temporary worker shall be defined to include both temporary and less than half time employees and means a person who is employed in:

 1. An interim assignment(s) of up to one year to a vacant regular position to perform work associated with a regularly budgeted position that is temporarily vacant and has no incumbent; or

 2. An interim assignment for short-term replacement of a regular employee of up to one year when the incumbent is temporarily absent; or

 3. A short-term assignment of up to one year, which may be extended beyond one year only while the assignment is in the process of being converted to a regular position, to perform work that is not ongoing regular work and for which there is no regularly budgeted position; or

 4. A less than half-time assignment for seasonal, on-call, intermittent or regularly scheduled work that normally does not exceed one thousand forty (1040) hours in a year, but may be extended up to one thousand three hundred (1300) hours once every three years and may also be extended while the assignment is in the process of being converted to a regular position; or

 5. A term-limited assignment for a period of more than one but less than three years for time-limited work related to a specific project, grant or other non-routine substantial body of work, or for the replacement of a regularly appointed employee when that employee is absent on long-term disability time loss, medical or military leave of absence.

 1.2.1 Temporary workers in the following types of assignments shall cease receiving premium pay at the time indicated and begin receiving wage progression and benefits as provided in SMC 4.20.055 D:

 1. interim and short term assignments after one thousand forty (1040) regular straight time hours for the remainder of the assignment unless the Personnel Director determines that the assignment will terminate so imminently that the benefits package would be of minimal value to the worker.

 2. term-limited assignments starting with the first day and for the duration of the assignment.

 3. any assignments that the appointing authority has proposed be converted to regular position authority regardless of the number of hours worked.

 1.3 Temporary employees shall be exempt from all provisions of this Agreement except Sections 1.1, 1.2, 1.3, 2.2, 2.3, 2.3.1, and 9.1. Where the provisions in Personnel Rule 11 do not conflict with the expressed provisions of this Agreement, the Personnel Rule 11 shall apply and be subject to the grievance procedure as provided for in this Agreement.

 1.4 Use of temporary employees is governed by a Memorandum of Agreement by and between the City of Seattle and the Union. The City may only use temporary employees in accordance with the terms of such agreement or as modified through agreement of the parties from time to time.

 ARTICLE 2 - UNION MEMBERSHIP AND DUES

 2.1 The City agrees that the Union has the right to encourage all employees in the bargaining unit to become and remain members in good standing of the Union, and the Union accepts its responsibility to fairly represent all employees in the bargaining unit regardless of membership status.

 2.2 The City agrees to deduct from the pay check of each employee who has so authorized it the regular monthly dues uniformly required of members of the Union, or an agency fee. The amounts deducted shall be transmitted monthly to the Union on behalf of the employees involved. Authorization by the employee shall be on a form approved by the parties hereto and may be revoked by the employee upon request.

 2.2.1 On or before the date of employment within the bargaining unit, the City shall, on a standard written form, inform each individual so employed of his or her inclusion within the bargaining unit.

 2.2.2 Within thirty (30) calendar days of the first day of employment for each individual so employed, the City shall, on a standard written form, notify the Union of the following information: name, address, job classification, job location and date of hire into the bargaining unit.

 2.3 All employees covered by this Agreement who voluntarily are, or who voluntarily become, members of the Union in good standing on or after the date of signing of this Agreement or the date of commencement of employment with the City, whichever is the later date, shall, subject to the requirement of applicable law, remain members of the Union during the term of this Agreement.

 2.3.1 A temporary employee may, in lieu of the Union membership requirements, pay a service fee in an amount equivalent to one and four-tenths (1.4%) of the total gross earnings received by the temporary employee for all hours worked within the bargaining unit each biweekly pay period, commencing with the thirty-first (31st) day following the temporary employee's first date of assignment to perform bargaining unit work.

 2.4 It is recognized that proper negotiations and administration of negotiated agreements entail expense which is appropriately shared by all employees within the bargaining unit. To this end each employee within the bargaining unit will be required, as a condition of employment, to pay to the Union the regular monthly dues uniformly required of members, or shall pay an amount determined by the Union in compliance with the requirements of applicable law to the Union as an agency fee. This obligation (as a condition of employment) shall commence thirty (30) calendar days following the employee's date of hire or thirty (30) calendar days following the effective date of this Agreement, whichever is later.

 2.4.1 Employees covered by this Agreement who have a religious objection to Union membership that satisfies the religious exemption criteria set forth in applicable law shall pay an amount equivalent to regular Union dues and/or agency fees to a nonreligious charity or to another charitable organization mutually agreed upon by the employee affected and the Union. The employee shall furnish written proof that such payment has been made. If the employee and the Union do not reach agreement on such matter, the Public Employment Relations Commission shall designate the charitable organization.

 2.4.2 Failure by an employee to abide by the afore-referenced provisions shall constitute cause for discharge of such employee; provided, however, it shall be the responsibility of the Union to notify the City in writing when it is seeking discharge of an employee for noncompliance with Sections 2.3, 2.3.1 and 2.4 of this Article. When an employee fails to fulfill the union security obligations set forth within this Article, the Union shall forward a "Request for Discharge Letter" to the department head (with copies to the affected employee and the City Director of Labor Relations). Accompanying the Discharge Letter shall be a copy of the letter to the employee from the Union explaining the employee's obligation under Article 2.

 2.4.3 The "Request for Discharge Letter" shall specifically request the discharge of the employee for failure to abide by Sections 2.3, 2.3.1 and 2.4 of Article 2, but provide the employee and the City with thirty (30) calendar days' written notification of the Union's intent to require discharge, during which time the employee may make restitution in the amount which is overdue. Upon receipt of the Union's request, the department head shall give notice in writing to the employee, with a copy to the Union and the City Director of Labor Relations, that the employee faces discharge upon the request of the Union at the end of the thirty (30) calendar day period noted in the Union's "Request for Discharge Letter" and that the employee has an opportunity before the end of said thirty (30) calendar day period to present to the department any information relevant to why the department should not act upon the Union's written request for the employee's discharge.

 2.4.4 In the event the employee has not yet fulfilled the obligation set forth within Sections 2.3, 2.3.1 and 2.4 of this Article within the thirty (30) calendar day period noted in the Request for Discharge Letter, the Union shall thereafter reaffirm in writing to the department head, with copies to the affected employee and the Director of Labor Relations, its original written request for discharge of such employee. Unless sufficient legal explanation or reason is presented by the employee why discharge is not appropriate or unless the Union rescinds its request for the discharge, the City shall, as soon as possible thereafter, effectuate the discharge of such employee. Absent good cause not to effectuate discharge, the City must discharge employees who do not fulfill their obligations under this Article. If the employee has fulfilled the union security obligation within the thirty (30) calendar day period, the Union shall so notify the department head in writing, with a copy to the City Director of Labor Relations and the affected employee. If the Union has reaffirmed its request for discharge, the department head shall notify the Union in writing, with a copy to the City Director of Labor Relations and the affected employee, that the department effectuated the discharge and the specific date such discharge was effectuated, or that the department has not discharged the employee, setting forth the good cause why it has not done so.

 2.5 The Union will administer the provisions of this Article with regard to membership or Union of employees in accord with its obligations under the law. Any disputes brought by an employee solely concerning the amount of dues or fees and/or the responsibility of the Union to the employees covered by this Agreement shall not be subject to the grievance and arbitration procedures set forth in this Agreement. The Union agrees to indemnify and save harmless the Employer from any and all liability arising from disputes concerning the amount of Union dues or fees and/or liability arising from a wrongful Request for Discharge by the Union pursuant to this Article; provided, however, this indemnity and/or save harmless shall not apply to any negligence or wrongful act of the Employer in administering its obligations under this Article.

 ARTICLE 3 - RIGHTS OF MANAGEMENT

 3.1 The right to hire, promote, discipline/discharge for just cause, improve efficiency, and determine the work schedules and locations of department headquarters are examples of management prerogatives. It is also understood that the City retains its right to manage and operate its departments except as may be limited by an express provision of this Agreement.

 3.2 Delivery of municipal services in the most efficient, effective and courteous manner is of paramount importance to the City and, as such, maximized productivity is recognized to be an obligation of the employees covered by this Agreement. In order to achieve this goal, the parties hereby recognize the City's right to determine the City's methods, processes, and means of providing municipal services; the right to increase or diminish operations, in whole or in part; the right to increase, diminish or change municipal equipment, including the introduction of any and all new, improved or automated methods or equipment; and the assignment of employees to specific jobs within the bargaining unit.

 3.3 The City will make every effort to utilize its employees to perform all work, but the City reserves the right to contract out for work under the following guidelines: (1) required expertise is not available within the City work force, or (2) the contract will result in cost savings to the City, or (3) the occurrence of peak loads above the work force capability.

 Determination as to (1), (2), or (3) above shall be made by the department head, and their determination in such case shall be final, binding and not subject to the grievance procedure; provided, however, prior to approval by the department to contract out work under this provision, the Union shall be notified. The department head shall make available to the Union upon request (1) a description of the services to be so performed, and (2) the detailed factual basis supporting the reasons for such action.

 The Union may grieve contracting out for work as described herein, if such contract involves work normally performed by employees covered by this Agreement, and if that contract is the cause of the layoff of employees covered by this Agreement.

 3.4 The Employer agrees to notify the Union in advance of anticipated departmental changes significantly affecting working conditions of employees covered by this Agreement. Conferences may be held thereon upon request by either party prior to such changes being placed in effect. For illustrative purposes, such changes would include, but are not limited to, changes in bargaining unit working hours, and the expansion or reduction of major services. Transfers, reassignments, and emergency situations shall be exempt from this provision.

 3.5 The Union recognizes the City's right to establish and/or revise its performance evaluation system(s). Such systems may be used to determine acceptable performance levels, prepare work schedules, and to measure the performance of each employee or groups of employees.

 The City shall notify the Union prior to establishing new and/or revising existing performance evaluation system(s).

 3.6 Any performance standards used to measure the performance of employees shall be reasonable.

 ARTICLE 4 - WORK STOPPAGES

 4.1 The City and the Union agree that the public interest requires the efficient and uninterrupted performance of all City services, and to this end pledge their best efforts to avoid or eliminate any conduct contrary to this objective. During the life of the Agreement, the Union shall not cause or condone any work stoppage, strike, slowdown, or similar interference with City functions by employees under this Agreement and, should same occur, the Union agrees to take appropriate steps to end such interference. Employees shall not cause or engage in any work stoppage, strike, slowdown, or similar interference with City functions for the term of this Agreement. Employees covered by this Agreement who engage in any of the foregoing actions shall be subject to disciplinary actions as may be determined by the City.

 4.2 In the event, however, that there is a work stoppage, strike, slowdown, or similar interference with City functions which is not authorized by the Union, the City agrees that there shall be no liability on the part of the Union, its officers or representatives; provided that in the event of such unauthorized action, they first meet the following conditions:

 A. Within not more than four (4) hours after notification by the City of the occurrence of any such unauthorized action, the Union shall publicly disavow the same by posting a notice on the bulletin boards available, stating that such action is unauthorized by the Union.

 B. The Union, its officers, and representatives shall promptly order its members to return to work, notwithstanding the existence of picket lines.

 C. The Union, its officers, and representatives will, in good faith, use every reasonable effort to terminate such unauthorized action.

 D. The Union shall not question the unqualified right of the City to discipline or discharge employees engaging in or encouraging such action. It is understood that such action on the part of the City shall be final and binding upon the Union and its members, and shall in no case be construed as a violation by the City of any provisions in this Agreement.

 4.3 The City shall not engage in any lockout or similar action.

 ARTICLE 5 - GRIEVANCE PROCEDURE

 5.1 Any dispute between the City and the Union or between the City and any employee covered by this Agreement concerning the interpretation, application, claim of breach, or violation of the express terms of this Agreement shall be deemed a grievance. An employee at any time may present a grievance to the City and have such grievance adjusted without the intervention of the Union, if the adjustment is not inconsistent with the expressed terms of this Agreement and if the Union has been given notice of the grievance and reasonable opportunity to be present at any meeting called for the resolution of such grievance. Grievances regarding suspension, demotion, and termination must be filed at Step 3 of the grievance procedure. There shall be no change in the nature of any grievance after it is filed.

 5.1.1 An employee has the right to have a Union representative, Union officer or Shop Steward present at each step of the grievance procedure.

 5.2 A grievance shall be processed as follows:

 Step 1 - The grievance shall be submitted in writing to the Parking Enforcement Unit Commander within twenty (20) business days of the alleged contract violation. The grievance shall include a description of the incident and the date it occurred. The parties agree to make every effort to settle the grievance at this stage promptly. The Unit Commander should consult and/or arrange a meeting with the employee's supervisor or such other person as is necessary to resolve the grievance. Within ten (10) business days after being notified of the alleged grievance, the Unit Commander shall make arrangements for a grievance meeting and shall answer the grievance in writing within ten (10) business days after the grievance meeting. The Unit Commander shall answer the grievance in writing within ten (10) business days after being notified of the alleged grievance.

 Step 2 - If the grievance is not resolved as provided in Step 1, it shall be submitted in writing by the Union to the Bureau Chief with a copy to the City Director of Labor Relations within ten (10) business days after the receipt of the Step 1 answer. The Step 2 grievance shall state the section(s) of the Agreement allegedly violated, provide a detailed explanation of the grievance, and identify the remedy sought.

 With Mediation:

 At the time the aggrieved employee and/or the Union submits the grievance to the Bureau Chief, the Union or the aggrieved employee or the Bureau Chief may submit a written request for voluntary mediation assistance, with a copy to the Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) Coordinator, the City Director of Labor Relations and the Union. If the ADR Coordinator determines that the case is in line with the protocols and procedures of the ADR process, within fifteen (15) business days from receipt of the request for voluntary mediation assistance, the ADR Coordinator or his/her designee will schedule a mediation conference and make the necessary arrangements for the selection of a mediator(s). The mediator(s) will serve as an impartial third party who will encourage and facilitate a resolution to the dispute. The mediation conference(s) will be confidential and will include the parties. A Union Representative and a Labor Negotiator from City Labor Relations may attend the mediation conference(s). Other persons may attend with the permission of the mediator(s) and both parties. If the parties agree to settle the matter, the mediator(s) will assist in drafting a settlement agreement, which the parties shall sign. An executed copy of the settlement agreement shall be provided to the parties, with either a copy or a signed statement of the disposition of the grievance submitted to the City Director of Labor Relations and the Union. The relevant terms of the settlement agreement shall be provided by the parties to the department's designated officials who need to assist in implementing the agreement. If the grievance is not settled within ten (10) business days of the initial mediation conference date, the City Director of Labor Relations, the Bureau Chief and the Union shall be so informed by the ADR Coordinator.

 The parties to a mediation shall have no power through a settlement agreement to add to, subtract from, alter, change, or modify the terms of the collective bargaining agreement or to create a precedent regarding the interpretation of the collective bargaining agreement or to apply the settlement agreement to any circumstance beyond the explicit dispute applicable to said settlement agreement.

 If the grievance is not resolved through mediation, within ten (10) business days after receipt of notification from the ADR Coordinator that the grievance was not resolved, the Bureau Chief shall make arrangements for a meeting between the aggrieved employee, Union Representative and/or Union officer or Shop Steward, together with the department labor relations representative. The City Director of Labor Relations or his/her designee may attend said meeting. Within ten (10) business days after the meeting, the Bureau Chief shall forward a reply in writing to the Union.

 Without Mediation:

 Within then (10) business days after receipt of the grievance, the Bureau Chief shall make arrangements for a meeting between the aggrieved employee, Union Representative and/or Union officer or Shop Steward, together with the Unit Commander, and departmental labor relations representative. The City Director of Labor Relations or his/her designee may attend said meeting. Within ten (10) business days after the meeting, the Bureau Chief shall forward a reply to the Union.

 Step 3 - If the grievance is not resolved as provided in Step 2 above, the grievance, as presented in Step 2, as well as a statement of the Union identifying in general those issues that remain unresolved, shall be forwarded by the Union within ten (10) business days after the Step 2 answer to the City Director of Labor Relations with a copy to the Chief of Police. The Union may also include a statement of the Union's reasons for not accepting the Step 2 response.

 Mediation can be requested at Step 3 in the same manner as outlined in Step 2. The grievance must be filed in the time frame specified in Step 3 and responded to in the time frame specified in Step 3 after receipt of notification from the ADR Coordinator that the grievance was not resolved through mediation.

 The Director of Labor Relations or his/her designee shall investigate the alleged grievance and, if deemed appropriate, he/she shall, within then (10) business days, make arrangements for a meeting between the appropriate parties. He/she shall thereafter make a confidential recommendation to the Chief of Police who shall, in turn, give the Union an answer in writing within ten (10) business days after receipt of the grievance or the meeting between the parties.

 Step 4 - If the alleged grievance is not settled in Step 3, it may be referred to the American Arbitration Association for arbitration to be conducted under its voluntary labor arbitration regulations, or the City and the Union may mutually agree to an alternative method to select an arbitrator. Such reference to arbitration will be made within 20 (20) business days after decision in Step 3, and will be accompanied with the following information:

 A. Identification of Section(s) of Agreement allegedly violated.

 B. Details or nature of the alleged violation.

 C. Position of party who is referring the grievance to arbitration.

 D. Question(s) which the arbitrator is being asked to decide.

 E. Remedy sought.

 Mediation can be requested at Step 4 in the same manner as outlined in Step 2. The grievance must be submitted to binding arbitration within the time frame specified in Step 4 and processed within the time frame specified in Step 4 after receipt of notification from the ADR Coordinator that the grievance was not resolved in mediation.

 Arbitrations may, by mutual agreement, be submitted to expedited arbitration in accordance with American Arbitration Association procedures.

 The City and the Union will meet to select, by mutual agreement or by alternatively striking names, an arbitrator to hear the parties' dispute. Each party will propose a minimum of three names. If the striking method is used, the first party to strike a name will be determined by a coin toss. If the initiating party fails to begin the process for the selection of an arbitrator and, as a result, an arbitrator is not selected within ninety (90) calendar days of the referral to arbitration, the referral to arbitration shall be deemed withdrawn.

 5.3 The parties agree to abide by the award made in connection with any arbitrable difference.

 5.4 In connection with any arbitration proceeding held pursuant to this Agreement, it is understood as follows:

 A. The arbitrator shall have no power to render a decision that will add to, subtract from, or alter, change, or modify the terms of this Agreement, and his/her power shall be limited to interpretation or application of only the express terms of this Agreement.

 B. The decision of the arbitrator regarding any arbitrable difference shall be final, conclusive, and binding upon the City, the Union, and the employees involved.

 C. The cost of the arbitrator shall be borne equally by the City and the Union, and each party shall bear the cost of presenting its own case. [Note: One party could bear the cost of the arbitrator for disciplinary grievances submitted to arbitration under the Offer of Settlement procedure described at Section 6.7B.]

 D. The arbitrator's decision shall be made in writing and shall be issued to the parties within thirty (30) calendar days after the case is submitted to the arbitrator.

 5.5 Any time limits stipulated in the grievance procedure may be extended for stated periods of time by the appropriate parties by mutual agreement in writing. Similarly, any aspect of this Article may likewise be modified by written agreement of the parties.

 5.6 A grievance in the interest of ten (10) or more of the employees in the bargaining unit shall be reduced to writing by the Union and may be introduced at Step 2 of the grievance procedure and be processed within the time limits set forth herein. A grievance in the interest of a majority of the employees in the bargaining unit shall be reduced to writing by the Union and may be introduced at Step 3 of the grievance procedure and be processed within the time limits set forth herein.

 5.7 Employees covered by this Agreement shall follow all written and verbal directives even if such directives are allegedly in conflict with provisions of this Agreement; provided however, that this provision does not impair the right to subsequently grieve such directive and to obtain appropriate recourse for said alleged violation.

 5.8 Failure by an employee or the Union to comply with any time limitations of the procedure in this Article shall constitute withdrawal of the grievance. Failure by the City to comply with any time limitation of the procedure in this Article shall allow the Union to proceed to the next step without waiting for the City to reply at the previous step.

 5.9 Arbitration awards or grievance settlements shall not be retroactive beyond the date of the occurrence or non-occurrence upon which the grievance is based, that date being twenty (20) business days or less prior to the initial filing of the grievance.

 5.10 Either party may make an Offer of Settlement to encourage settlement of a grievance in advance of a scheduled arbitration hearing. However, in the event a party refuses to accept an Offer of Settlement and recovers less than was offered in such Offer of Settlement, said party will be required to bear all of the costs of arbitration, excluding attorney and witness fees, contrary to Section 5.4 above.

 5.11 Alternative Dispute Resolution. The City and the Union encourage the use of the City's Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) Program or other ADR process to resolve non-contractual workplace conflicts/disputes. Participation in the City's ADR Program or in another ADR Program is entirely voluntary and confidential.

 ARTICLE 6 - DISCIPLINARY PROCEDURE AND PERSONNEL FILES

 6.1 The City may reprimand orally and/or in writing, suspend, demote, or discharge an employee for just cause.

 6.2 The off-duty activities of employees shall not be cause for disciplinary action unless said activities are detrimental to the employee's work performance or violate the rules and regulations of the department or impair the integrity of the department.

 6.3 Prior to any disciplinary action being taken against an employee, the employee will be provided a general description of the substance of an investigatory file and be provided an opportunity to respond.

 6.4 Investigatory Interviews. When an employee attends a meeting for purposes of discussing an incident that the employee reasonably believes may lead to discipline because of that particular incident, the employee shall have a right to be accompanied by a representative of the Union. If the employee desires Union representation during the meeting, they shall notify the City and will be provided a reasonable period of time not to exceed twenty- four (24) hours to obtain such representation. The notice regarding the interview and the time, place, and manner in which it is conducted shall be reasonable and consistent with the Internal Investigations Section and or Department procedures applicable to civilian Department employees.

 6.4.1 Employees shall be notified in writing before a finding is made regarding any complaint involving the employee when such complaint will require either a written or oral statement from the employee, or by the nature of the complaint, the employee could be subject to disciplinary action.

 6.4.2 The employee will be provided with sufficient facts regarding the complaint so that he/she can prepare a statement in their defense, should he/she so desire. Employees will be given seven (7) calendar days after receipt of said facts to submit a statement. This time limit may be extended, in the discretion of the Department, upon submission of a written justification by the employee for such delay. The Union agrees that delay requests will be reasonable and not applied for merely to delay the process.

 6.4.3 Whenever an employee submits a verbal or written statement as required by the Department, they should preface the statement with the following sentence:

 "This is a true and involuntary statement given by me in accordance with Section 1.117 of the Seattle Police Department Manual."

 6.4.4 One of the following dispositions will be assigned once the complaint has been investigated: 1) Sustained - the allegation of misconduct is supported by a preponderance of evidence; 2) Not Sustained - a preponderance of evidence neither proves nor disproves the allegation of misconduct; 3) Unfounded - a preponderance of evidence indicates the allegation of misconduct is false or the alleged act did not occur; 4) Exonerated - the preponderance of evidence indicates the alleged act did occur, but the act was justified, lawful and proper.

 6.4.5 After an employee has been advised of a complaint against him/her and at the conclusion of that investigation, the employee will be advised of any findings, including those instances where the finding was "exonerated" or "unfounded."

 6.4.6 An employee may request access to the investigative portion of closed Internal Investigations, EEO and performance complaint files in which the employee was an accused. Such a request shall be made in writing fully stating the reasons such access is desired. Department shall consider the circumstances and not unreasonably deny such access.

 6.4.7 It is agreed by the City and the Union that it is in the public interest and to their mutual benefit to maintain confidentiality of Departmental disciplinary proceedings to the extent that circumstances may reasonably allow.

 6.4.8 With the exception of criminal investigations or where the employee fails to cooperate or is unavailable to participate in the investigation, complaint investigations will be completed by the City within one-hundred eighty (180) days after the initial employee notification of said complaint. Employees who are the subject of an investigation shall be promptly advised of the completion of the investigation, the finding and proposed discipline. No discipline may result from the investigation if the investigation of the complaint is not completed and the finding provided to the named employee within one-hundred eighty (180) days after the employee has been notified of the complaint.

 6.5 Appeals of disciplinary action shall be processed in accordance with the procedures set forth below:

 Within twenty (20) business days of receiving written notice of disciplinary action, the employee through the Union may appeal the discipline through the grievance procedure delineated in Article 5; provided that an employee covered by this Agreement must upon initiating objections relating to disciplinary action use either the grievance procedure contained herein (with the Union processing the grievance) or pertinent procedures regarding disciplinary appeals under the City Personnel Ordinance, including Civil Service procedures. Under no circumstances may an employee use both the grievance procedure and Personnel Ordinance procedures, including Civil Service procedures, relative to the same disciplinary action. While the employee must make a timely selection of one, and not both of these appeal options, this selection requirement will not itself act to divest any employee of his/her right to appeal disciplinary action. In the event both a grievance and a Civil Service Commission appeal have been filed regarding the same disciplinary action, the grievance will be considered withdrawn.

 6.6 After three years from the date of a written reprimand, an employee who is not the subject of any subsequent sustained complaints or of a pending investigation may petition the Chief of Police for the removal of the written reprimand from his/her department personnel file. The Chief, acting in good faith, shall consider the circumstances and the employee's request for such removal and advise the employee of his/her decision.

 6.7 Ethics and Elections Commission. Nothing contained within this Agreement shall prohibit the Seattle Ethics and Elections Commission from administering the Code of Ethics, including but not limited to, the authority to impose monetary fines for violations of the Code of Ethics. Such fines are not discipline under this Agreement and, as such, are not subject to the Grievance procedure contained within this Agreement. Records of any fines imposed or monetary settlements shall not be included in the employee's personnel file. Fines imposed by the Commission shall be subject to appeal on the record to the Seattle Municipal Court.

 In the event the employer acts on a recommendation by the Commission to discipline an employee, the employee's contractual rights to contest such discipline shall apply. No record of the disciplinary recommendations by the Commission shall be placed in the employee's personnel file unless such discipline is upheld or unchallenged. Commission hearings are to be closed if requested by the employee who is the subject of such hearing.

 6.8 Employees covered by this Agreement may examine their personnel file in the presence of a designated Personnel Section representative. Materials placed into the employee's personnel file relating to job performance or personal conduct shall be brought to his or her attention. Employees who challenge material included in their personnel file may submit to the Personnel Section material relating to the challenge that will be inserted in their personnel file. Files maintained by supervisors regarding an employee are considered part of the employee's personnel file and subject to the requirements of state law, RCW 49.12.240, RCW 49.12.250 and RCW 49.12.260, and this provision, including allowing employee access to such files. However, internal investigation files shall not be covered by this provision. Such files and employee access thereto shall be governed by departmental regulations.

 6.9 The City agrees that the contents of personnel files, including the personal photograph, shall, to the extent permitted by law, be kept confidential. The City shall make reasonable efforts to restrict the use of information in the files other than name, payroll title, unit of assignment, rate of pay, and date of hire to internal use by the City. In addition, the City shall not release such information outside the City without reasonable advance notice to or a waiver signed by the subject employee, unless providing such notice or obtaining a waiver is impractical. The City also agrees that medical, emergency notification, home address, home telephone number, social security number, beneficiary designation, records of discipline, and performance evaluations shall be kept confidential to the extent permitted by law, and access to such information by City employees shall be limited to those persons authorized to access and needing to know such information.

 ARTICLE 7 - CLASSIFICATION,WAGES, AND OTHER COMPENSATION

 7.1 The classification of employees covered under this Agreement and the corresponding rates of pay effective December 26, 2007, are set forth in Appendix A, which is attached hereto and made a part of this Agreement.

 7. 2 The Union or the City may propose a gainsharing program during the term of this Agreement. Implementation shall be subject to mutual agreement between the Union and City.

 7.3 Correction of Payroll Errors - In the event it is determined there has been an error in an employee's paycheck, an underpayment shall be corrected within two pay periods; and upon written notice, an overpayment shall be corrected as follows:

 A. If the overpayment involved only one paycheck;

 1. By payroll deductions spread over two pay periods; or

 2. By payments from the employee spread over two pay periods.

 B. If the overpayment involved multiple paychecks, by a prepayment schedule through payroll deduction not to exceed twenty-six (26) pay periods in duration, with a minimum payroll deduction of not less than twenty-five dollars ($25) per pay period.

 C. If an employee separates from the City service before an overpayment is repaid, any remaining amount due the City will be deducted from his/her final paycheck(s).

 D. By other means as may be mutually agreed between the City and the employee. The Union Representative may participate in this process at the request of the involved employee. All parties will communicate/cooperate in resolving these issues.

 7.4 The City shall take such actions as may be necessary so that employee costs directly associated with their City employment for public transportation and/or parking in a City owned facility paid through payroll deduction will be structured in a manner whereby said costs are tax exempt, consistent with applicable IRS rules and regulations. Said actions shall be completed for implementation of this provision no later than January 1, 2005.

 7.5 The parties hereby acknowledge and affirm that a past practice shall not have been established obligating the City to continue to provide employee parking in an instance where employees were permitted to park on City property at their work location if the City sells the property, builds on existing parking sites, or some other substantial change in circumstance occurs. However, the City shall be obligated to bargain the impacts of such changes.

 7.6 Meal Reimbursement while on Travel Status. An employee shall be reimbursed for meals while on travel status at the federal per diem rate. An employee will not be required to submit receipts for meals and may retain any unspent portion of an advance cash allowance for meals.

 .ARTICLE 8 - HOURS OF WORK AND OVERTIME

 8.1 For purposes of this Article the following definitions shall apply:

 Work schedule shall be the scheduled days of work.

 Work shift shall be the hours scheduled to work on each scheduled day of work.

 Work week shall be a seven-day period beginning with the first shift on Wednesday and ending at the conclusion of the evening shift on Tuesday. (The City pay period consists of two such work weeks.)

 Normal day's work shall be eight (8) hours.

 Normal week's work shall be forty (40) hours.

 8.2 Work schedules shall normally consist of five consecutive days (Monday through Friday or Tuesday through Saturday) followed by two consecutive days off except as provided below:

Subject to staffing needs, the Commander of the Parking Enforcement Unit or his/her designee will schedule the second furlough day on any day requested by the employee within the same work week.

 8.2.1 Alternative Work Schedules. The parties agree that alternative work schedules, such as 4/10's or 9/80's, may be utilized that are mutually agreed upon in writing by the employees and the Director of Parking Enforcement.

 8.3 Employees covered by this Agreement shall be provided an unpaid, duty-free meal period not to exceed thirty (30) minutes for each four-hour period worked during their regular shift. In addition, employees shall be entitled to a paid fifteen-minute rest period for each four hours worked during their regular shift.

 With regard to overtime assignments, the following conditions apply:

 1. Overtime assignments for PEO's in excess of four (4) hours shall include a working meal break, not to exceed 30 minutes.

 2. The working meal break shall be taken by the PEO at a time that will minimize interference with the ability of the PEO to perform their overtime assignment.

 3. The PEO shall notify their supervisor that they intend to take a meal break and the supervisor may decline to approve the meal break or interrupt a previously approved meal break, if the supervisor believes that there is a need for an immediate response by the PEO to a situation.

 4. During a working meal break, the PEO shall monitor radio and remain available to respond immediately. The working meal break shall be taken within or near the location/area to which the PEO has been assigned. In addition, if the assignment involves the use of a vehicle, the PEO shall remain at or near their vehicle during their meal break.

 8.4 All work performed in excess of forty (40) hours in any work week shall be considered as overtime. Such overtime work shall be either paid for at the rate of one and one-half (1-1/2) times the employee's regular straight-time rate of pay or compensated for by compensatory time off at a rate of one and one-half (1-1/2) times the overtime hours worked. Compensation in the form of compensatory time must be agreeable to both the affected employee and the City. Any unused accrued compensatory time may be carried over at the end of the year. At no time can the balance of an employee's available compensatory time, including compensatory time that is carried over, exceed fifty- six (56) hours. No more than forty (40) compensatory hours may be earned, used or cashed out within a calendar year. Sixteen (16) compensatory hours may be earned or used in addition to the forty (40) hour maximum consistent with the provisions of Section 8.10 herein. Any compensatory time in excess of fifty-six (56) hours per employee will be cashed out by the department.

 A compensatory time use request submitted at least two (2) or more working days prior to the requested date shall be returned to the employee, either granted or denied, no later than five (5) working days from the date of the request or the working day prior to the requested date, whichever is earlier. Any request for two (2) or more compensatory days shall be submitted on the standard leave request form. At the time a request for compensatory time off is made employees must have a sufficient balance to cover the request.

 8.5 A shift extension is defined as reporting for duty as scheduled within four (4) hours preceding or one hour or less following an employee's regularly scheduled shift. Shift extension hours and fractions thereof shall be compensated at the overtime rate on an hour-for-hour basis.

 8.6 In the event overtime is not a shift extension either at the beginning or end of a normal shift, employees who are called back to work after being relieved of duty or required to appear in court in regard to official duties on their normal day off shall receive a minimum of four (4) hours' pay at the overtime rate, and shall be compensated for any additional time worked beyond the four- (4) hour minimum at the overtime rate of pay for each additional hour or fraction thereof.

 8.7 In the event that an employee reports to work on a scheduled workday or when otherwise required and is sent home, said employee shall receive four (4) hours' pay for working four (4) or less hours, and eight (8) hours' pay for working eight (8) hours or less, but more than four (4) hours.

 8.8 There shall be no pyramiding of overtime and holiday premium pay.

 8.9 Employees may be required to work overtime. The details of the overtime assignment process have been incorporated in a memorandum of agreement dated October 12, 2007. That memorandum of agreement shall remain in effect until amended by mutual agreement. Upon the request of either party, on or before October 1 of each calendar year, the memorandum of agreement shall be jointly reviewed. The review shall be completed by the end of the calendar year.

 8.10 In the event of heavy snowfall or ice conditions where employees cannot safely report to work or when conditions/circumstances are such that management decides to suspend enforcement of parking ordinances and employees are sent home or informed not to report to work, accumulated compensatory, vacation, or holiday time shall be used to offset hours lost from scheduled duty. In the event no compensatory, vacation, or holiday time is available, the employee shall be given leave without pay for such hours. In the event an employee does not receive notice that parking enforcement operations have been suspended and is able to safely report to work, that employee will have the option of remaining at work and performing administrative duties as assigned on a paid status for the balance of their shift.

 8.11 An employee who requests or voluntarily chooses to accept temporary assignment to a lower-paid classification for the primary benefit of the employee shall be paid at the rate of the lower classification. This provision does not apply to limited-duty assignments.

 8.12 Whenever an employee is assigned by proper authority to perform all of the duties and accept all of the responsibility of an employee at a higher-paid classification for a period of four (4) consecutive hours or longer, he/she shall be paid at the rate established for such classification while performing such duties and accepting such responsibility. Proper authority shall be a supervisory employee in the line of organization.

 8.13 Swing shift hours shall include 4:00 p.m. until 11:59 p.m. and graveyard hours shall include 12:00 a.m. until 7:59 a.m.

 8.13.1 An employee who is scheduled to work not less than four (4) hours of his/her regular work shift during the swing shift hours shall receive a shift premium of 65 cents per hour for all scheduled hours worked during such shift. An employee who is scheduled to work not less than four (4) hours of his/her regular work shift during the graveyard shift shall receive a shift premium of 90 cents per hour for all scheduled hours worked during such shift.

 8.13.2 Involuntary overtime shall be defined as overtime worked during those shifts for which no discretionary time off is available and/or which are mandatorily assigned due to City emergency. Unless the overtime is involuntary, no shift premium pay will be due employees who work overtime during the evening shift hours as an extension of their regular shift or on a call back, if such employees do not regularly work the evening shift. If the overtime is involuntary, employees who do not regularly work the evening shift will receive the shift premium only for those hours actually worked during the evening shift hours.

 8.13.3 The above shift premium shall apply to time worked as opposed to time off with pay and therefore, for example, the premium shall not apply to sick leave, vacation, holiday pay, funeral leave, or other paid leave. Employees who work this shift for which a premium is paid shall have the shift premium included as part of the base hourly rate for purposes of computing the overtime rate pursuant to the requirements of the Fair Labor Standards Act.

 8.13.4 Shift assignments shall be made seasonally. Shifts shall be selected by the employee, by unit seniority.

 A. The year shall be divided into three seasons of:

 C. The shift selection process shall begin at least 30 days prior to a season beginning. As part of the shift selection process, an employee shall indicate his/her choice for both a shift time and an area assignment for that season.

 D. Notwithstanding the employee's choice in shift time and area assignment, Parking Enforcement Unit management may make reassignments of any duration for all uniformed personnel for purposes of addressing operational needs or special circumstances, including without limitation, an officer's inability to drive a scooter which would require assignment to an area in which enforcement is conducted by walking, or for purposes of addressing other specific performance-related matters, including the training needs of probationary employees.

 E. In case of an emergency requiring a concerted response as determined by the Unit Commander, any and all assignments may be revised on a day-to-day basis to serve the needs of the department in responding to the emergency condition. Assignment revisions may not continue any longer than the emergency period. An explanation shall be given to the Union during the emergency condition or immediately thereafter explaining the reason for the assignment revisions. If the expected length of the emergency condition is to exceed two (2) days, an expected length shall also be provided.

 8.13.5 Requests by employees who have successfully completed probation to trade shifts will be granted, provided that:

 A. The trade involves the direct exchange of shifts by two employees only;

 B. The trade can be accomplished without additional cost or overtime obligation to the employer;

 C. The trade will not interfere with the operations of the employer;

 D. The two employees agreeing to the trade have signed an agreement specifying the date of the trade, the shifts to be traded, and the reason for the trade; and

 E. Both supervisors, after having been provided reasonable notice and a copy of the agreement between the two employees, have approved the trade, which approval shall not be unreasonably denied.

 F. Employees may be subject to discipline for failure to report as scheduled to a shift to which they have agreed to report as a result of a trade.

 8.14 Secondary Employment Permits. The review of requests for secondary employment permits will be conducted consistent with Seattle Police Department Manual Section 1.289, except as noted below.

 A. In determining whether or not an employee has a record of above average sick leave, sick leave for the following reasons shall be excluded: certified family medical leave; on-the-job injury or illness; and funeral leave.

 B. In the event the secondary work permit of an employee is revoked or denied, the employee shall be provided an explanation of the reason and an opportunity to meet with the Unit Commander upon request.

 C. Upon the request of the employee, the denial or revocation of a secondary work permit shall be reconsidered after ninety (90) days. If the denial or revocation was for above average sick leave use and the sick leave use by the employee is below average for the one-year period prior to the date of the reconsideration, a new secondary work permit shall be approved unless there are other reasons for a denial. An employee on the mandatory sick leave reporting program may request reconsideration after he/she is no longer on the sick leave reporting program.

 D. Permits for work of less than four days duration must be approved by the employee's chain of command and must be obtained in writing.

 9.9 It is agreed by the City and the Union that employees have a reasonable expectation of privacy in their assigned lockers; provided, however, that the City may subject all PEO lockers, or a randomly selected portion of PEO lockers, to a routine inspection upon order of the Unit Commander and after reasonable notice to the Union and the PEO's. Individual lockers may be entered without prior notice only under exigent circumstances upon the order of a Lieutenant or above. If the City reasonably believes that a particular locker has been abandoned, the City may inspect such locker after providing reasonable notice through posting the locker or otherwise. Nothing in this section shall diminish or impair the PEO's right to privacy in the contents of items within such locker as otherwise provided by law.

 11.4 Eligible employees shall accumulate vacation from the date of entering City service and may use accumulated vacation with pay after one thousand forty (1040) hours on regular pay status with department approval.

 11.5 An employee who is eligible for vacation benefits shall accrue vacation from the date of entering City service or the date upon which he/she became eligible, and may accumulate a vacation balance which shall never exceed at any time two (2) times the number of annual vacation hours for which the employee is currently eligible. Accrual and accumulation of vacation time shall cease at the time an employee's vacation balance reaches the maximum balance allowed and shall not resume until the employee's vacation balance is below the maximum allowed.

 11.5.1 In the event that the City cancels an employee's already scheduled and approved vacation, leaving no time to reschedule such vacation before the employee's maximum balance is reached, the employee's vacation balance will be permitted to exceed the allowable maximum and the employee will continue to accrue vacation for a period of up to three months if such exception is approved by both the department head and the Personnel Director in order to allow rescheduling of the employee's vacation. In such cases the department head shall provide the Personnel Director with the circumstances and reasons leading to the need for such an extension, and approval shall not be unreasonably denied. Provided that the vacation time could be taken within such three-month period, no extension of this grace period will be allowed.

 11.6 The minimum vacation allowance to be used by an employee shall be one-hour.

 11.7 An employee who leaves the City service for any reason after more than six (6) months' service shall be paid in a lump sum for any unused vacation he/she has previously accrued.

 11.8 Upon the death of an employee who is in active service with the City, the employee's unused, accrued vacation balance that existed at the time of death shall be disbursed to the employee's designated beneficiary(ies) or the employee's estate.

 11.9 Pursuant to Section 11.10 below, the department head shall arrange vacation time for employees on such schedules as will least interfere with the functions of the department but which accommodate the desires of the employees to the greatest degree possible in light of staffing needs of the Unit and/or the employee's shift.

 11.10 Vacation requests for the calendar year shall be submitted no later than February 15. Such requests shall be returned no later than March 1 of such calendar year. Seniority shall govern if there are conflicts between vacation requests. All vacation requests submitted before February 15 shall take precedence over vacation requests submitted after that date. After February 15, and for vacation requests submitted for the balance of the month of February, vacation requests shall be granted on a first-come, first-served basis. After February 15, a vacation request submitted at least two (2) or more working days prior to the requested vacation date shall be returned to the employee, either granted or denied, no later than five (5) working days from the date of the request or the working day prior to the requested vacation date, whichever is earlier.

 11.11 In the event that an employee becomes seriously ill or seriously injured while he/she is on vacation and it can be established that the employee is incapacitated due to the illness or injury, the day or days that he/she is sick under these circumstances may, upon the request of the employee, be deducted from his/her accrued sick leave time rather than vacation, and he/she will for all purposes be treated as though he/she were off solely for the reason of the illness or injury. Upon request, the employee shall submit medical documentation of the illness or injury from the attending physician regardless of the number of days involved.

 11.12 Except for family and medical leave (FMLA) granted pursuant to federal, state or local law, or as otherwise provided by applicable law, unpaid leave requested for personal or medical reasons shall be administered according to City Personnel Rules, and as follows:

 A. Upon approval by the Chief of Police or his/her designee, an employee granted an unpaid personal leave of absence need not exhaust any unused vacation leave and compensatory time he/she has previously accrued before beginning the leave.

 B.

For calendar years 2005, 2006 and 2007, the selection, addition and/or elimination of medical, dental and vision benefit plans, and changes to such plans including, but not limited to, changes in benefit levels, co pays and premiums, shall be established through the Labor-Management Health Care Committee in accordance with the provisions of the Memorandum of Agreement established to govern the functioning of said Committee.

In addition, The City will pay the equivalent of $1 million, annualized, for the following, enhanced benefits implemented in 2005, which shall become a part of the "base" for the future City's cost obligations. The specific benefit enhancements will be determined by HC2. Further, The parties agree that eleven thousand dollars ($11,000) shall be utilized from the "Special" Rate Stabilization Fund (RSF) for the purpose of paying Aon Consulting to complete an analysis of the City's self-insured claims experience to identify potential Wellness and Disease Management Programs that would be best targeted to address the City's claims experience.

 e) Intent: Should the parties agree to reduce premium costs, the reduction would apply to City as well as employee premiums. Use of resources from the RSF during any contract year to reduce projected increase in health care costs that exceed the resources provided through 1, above, shall be authorized only if applied to the total, annual premiums of the respective health care plan(s); and

 f) No decision by the Health Care Committee shall be permitted that modifies the established percentages established in c), above.

Employees may purchase through payroll deduction an optional Buy-Up Plan with a 90-day elimination period, which insures 60% for the remainder of the employee's base monthly wage (up to a maximum $8,333 per month). Benefits may be reduced by the employee's income from other sources as set forth in the Plan Description. The provisions of the plan shall be further and more fully defined in the Plan Description issued by the Standard Insurance Company.

 13.2 Funeral Leave - Regular employees shall be allowed one (1) day off with pay for the purpose of attendance at the funeral of any close relative; provided that where such attendance requires total travel of two hundred (200) miles or more, one (1) additional day with pay shall be allowed; provided further, that the department head may, when circumstances require and upon application stating the reasons therefor, authorize additional leave for such purpose not to exceed an additional four (4) days chargeable to the sick leave account of the employee, but no combination of paid absence under this Section shall exceed five (5) days for any one (1) period of absence. In like circumstances and upon like application the department head may authorize for the purpose of attending the funeral of a relative other than a close relative, not to exceed five (5) days chargeable to the sick leave account of an employee. For purposes of this Section and as defined by Ordinance 114648, the term "close relative" shall mean the spouse or domestic partner, child, mother, father, brother, sister, grandchild, grandfather, or grandmother of the employee or of the spouse or domestic partner of such employee, and the term "relative other than a close relative" shall mean the uncle, aunt, cousin, niece, or nephew of such employee or spouse or domestic partner of the brother, sister, child or grandchild of such employee; or the uncle, aunt, cousin, niece, or nephew of spouse or domestic partner of the brother or sister of the spouse or domestic partner of such employee.

"Household" shall be defined as the physical aspects of the employee's residence.

 The "day" may be used in two separate instances but no more than eight (8) hours shall be allowed in any calendar year. In unforeseen emergencies that require additional time beyond eight (8) hours, the employee may request the use of accrued leave, with the exception of sick leave. The employee may request leave without pay in accordance with Article 11.12.

 ARTICLE 14 - ON-THE-JOB INJURY OR ILLNESS

 14.1 Any employee who is disabled in the discharge of his/her duties, and if such disablement results in absence from his/her regular duties, shall be compensated, except as otherwise hereinafter provided, in the amount of eighty percent (80%) of the employee's normal hourly rate of pay, not to exceed two hundred sixty-one (261) regularly scheduled workdays counted from the first regularly scheduled workday after the day of the on-the-job injury; provided the disability sustained must qualify the employee for benefits under State Industrial Insurance and Medical Aid Acts.

 14.1.1 Whenever an employee is injured on the job and compelled to seek immediate medical treatment, the employee shall be compensated in full for the remaining part of the day of injury without effect to his/her sick leave or vacation account. Scheduled workdays falling within only the first three (3) calendar days following the day of injury shall be compensable through accrued sick leave. Any earned vacation may be used in a like manner after sick leave is exhausted, provided that if neither accrued sick leave nor accrued vacation is available, the employee shall be placed on no-pay status for these three (3) days. If the period of disability extends beyond fourteen (14) calendar days, then (1) any accrued sick leave or vacation leave utilized that results in absence from his/her regular duties (up to a maximum of eighty percent [80%] of the employee's normal hourly rate of pay per day) shall be reinstated by Industrial Insurance, or (2) if no sick leave or vacation leave was available to the employee at that time, then the employee shall thereafter be compensated for the three (3) calendar days at the eighty percent (80%) compensation rate described in Section 14.1.

 Such compensation shall be authorized by the Personnel Director or his/her designee with the advice of such employee's department head on request from the employee, supported by satisfactory evidence of medical treatment of the illness or injury giving rise to such employee's claim for compensation under SMC 4.44, as now or hereinafter amended. Such authorization shall not be unreasonably withheld.

 14.2 In no circumstances will the amount paid under these provisions exceed an employee's gross pay minus mandatory deductions. This provision shall become effective when SMC 4.44, Disability Compensation, is revised to incorporate this limit.

 14.2.1 Employees must meet the standards listed in SMC 4.44.020 to be eligible for the benefit amount provided herein which exceeds the rate required to be paid by state law, hereinafter referred to as supplemental benefits. These standards require that employees: (1) comply with all Department of Labor and Industries rules and regulations and related City of Seattle and employing department policies and procedures; (2) respond, be available for, and attend medical appointments and treatments and meetings related to rehabilitation, and work hardening, conditioning or other treatment arranged by the City and authorized by the attending physician; (3) accept modified or alternative duty assigned by supervisors when released to perform such duty by the attending physician; (4) attend all meetings scheduled by the City of Seattle Workers' Compensation unit or employing department concerning the employee's status or claim when properly notified at least five (5) working days in advance of such meeting unless other medical treatment conflicts with the meeting and the employee provides twenty-four (24) hours' notice of such meeting or examination.

 The City will provide a copy of the eligibility requirements to employees when they file a workers' compensation claim. If records indicate two (2) no-shows, supplemental benefits may be terminated no sooner than seven (7) days after notification to the employee. The City's action will be subject to the grievance procedure.

 14.3 Compensation for holidays and earned vacation falling within a period of absence due to such disability shall be at the normal rate of pay, but such days shall not be considered as regularly scheduled workdays as applied to the time limitations set forth within Section 14.1. Disabled employees affected by the provisions of SMC 4.44 shall continue to accrue vacation and sick leave as though actively employed during the period set forth within Section 14.1.

 14.4 Any employee eligible for workers' compensation benefits under SMC 4.44 whose on-the-job injury or illness prevents him/her from performing his/her regular duties but who, in the judgment of a physician, could perform other duties which would not aggravate or worsen the worker's injury or illness may be offered a limited duty assignment, if such work is available. The duties of such an assignment will be consistent with the medical restrictions identified by the physician. An employee working a limited duty assignment shall be subject to the requirements of the department manual section regarding such assignments (in effect as of the date of this Agreement) and shall be compensated at his/her normal rate of pay. Refusal to accept an appropriate limited duty assignment may result in the loss of workers' compensation benefits.

 14.5 The department shall make reasonable efforts to assign an employee returning to full duties within two hundred sixty (260) work days following an on-the-job injury to the last shift to which the employee had been assigned prior to the injury.

 14.6 Sick leave shall not be used for any disability herein described except as allowed in Section 14.1.1.

 14.7 The afore-referenced disability compensation shall be understood to be in lieu of State Industrial Insurance Compensation and Medical Aid; provided, however, that employees who are not eligible to receive such supplemental benefits shall be entitled to receive State Industrial Insurance Compensation and Medical Aid, if eligible.

 14.8 Appeals of any denials under State Industrial Insurance Compensation and Medical Aid (not supplemental benefits) shall be made through the Department of Labor and Industries as prescribed in Title 51 RCW.

 14.9 Except as otherwise specifically provided herein, this Article shall in no manner affect employees' eligibility to receive full benefits and rights provided by applicable federal, state and local law.

 14.10 A probationary employee who believes that he/she has been discharged or otherwise discriminated against by the City in violation of RCW 51.48.025, based upon his/her filing or communicating to the employer an intent to file a claim for compensation or exercising rights under Chapter 51.48 RCW, may request review of such an allegation by the Chief or Police or his/her designee.

 ARTICLE 15 - RETIREMENT

 15.1 Pursuant to Ordinance 7844 as amended, all employees shall be covered by the Seattle City Employees Retirement System.

 ARTICLE 16 - LABOR-MANAGEMENT CONFERENCE COMMITTEE

 16.1 The City and the Union agree to establish a joint Conference Committee consisting of three (3) representatives of the Union, including the President of the Union or his/her representative, and three (3) representatives of the City, which may include the Director of Labor Relations or his/her representative. The participants on the committee shall be determined at the time the parties agree to initiate discussions regarding a particular subject or matter.

 16.2 The purpose of this Committee is to deal with matters of general concern to the Union and to the City as opposed to individual complaints of employees; provided, however, it is understood that the Conference Committee shall function in an advisory capacity and shall not be considered a decision-making body; and provided, further, it is understood that this Committee shall not be considered a collective bargaining forum and its composition shall not constitute a waiver of any other obligation provided by applicable law. It is further understood that the work of the parties under the Conference Committee procedure shall in no way add to or subtract from, alter, or amend this Agreement.

 16.3 Either the Union representative or the City representative may initiate a discussion of any subject of a general nature affecting employees covered by this Agreement. Subjects for discussion at Conference Committee meetings during the term of this Agreement shall be identified in advance. If such subjects have been identified by either party, the Committee shall meet not more than once each season. The parties shall alternate, meeting by meeting, the chair responsibilities. The person acting as chairperson shall develop a written agenda for the meeting with input from both parties identifying the subjects for discussion and shall distribute the agenda to all Committee members one week prior to the meeting, with a copy to the Bureau Commander, the Unit Commander and Labor Relations.

 16.4 Conference Committee meetings shall be scheduled during the employees' normally scheduled work hours and shall constitute paid work time.

 16.5 Any decisions or agreements reached by the Conference Committee shall be put in writing and distributed to the Union and the Unit Commander.

 16.6 Labor and management support continuing efforts to provide the best service delivery and the highest quality service in the most cost-effective manner to the citizens of Seattle. Critical to achieving this purpose is the involvement of employees in sharing information and creatively addressing workplace issues, including administrative and service delivery productivity, efficiency, quality control, and customer service.

 Labor and management agree that, in order to maximize participation and results from the Employee Involvement Committees ("EICs") no one will lose employment or equivalent rate of pay with the City of Seattle because of efficiencies resulting from an EIC initiative.

 In instances where the implementation of an EIC recommendation does result in the elimination of a position, management and labor will work together to find suitable alternative employment for the affected employee. An employee who chooses not to participate in and/or accept a reasonable employment offer, if qualified, will terminate his/her rights under this employment security provision.

 The parties support the use of the EIC process to explore potential alternative work schedules for employees. The adoption of any alternative work schedule shall be by mutual agreement.

 16.7 A Labor-Management Committee will:

 1. Review and problem-solve training needs for employees;

 2. Determine how employees will be notified in a timely manner about training opportunities; and

 3. Discuss how employees will have equal access to appropriate and relevant training.

 ARTICLE 17 - UNION REPRESENTATIVE, SHOP STEWARDS

 AND BULLETIN BOARDS

 17.1 A Union officer or shop steward may, after notifying the appropriate supervisor in charge, visit the work location of employees covered by this Agreement at any reasonable time for the purpose of investigating grievances.

 17.2 The Employer shall afford Union officers and shop stewards a reasonable amount of time while on duty to consult with aggrieved employees, provided that the Union officers and shop stewards or the aggrieved employee contact the immediate supervisor indicating the general nature of the business to be conducted and requesting the necessary time.

 17.3 The Union may appoint a shop steward for each shift within the Parking Enforcement Unit. In turn, the Union shall furnish a current list of shop stewards to the Police Department and the City Director of Labor Relations. Stewards shall be regular full-time employees and shall perform their regular duties as such. While on the job, shop stewards shall function as the Union's representatives for the purpose of informing the Union of any alleged violations of this Agreement, investigating and processing grievances relating thereto, informing members of Union business, and serving as Union representatives in circumstances where a member is entitled to Union representation, as long as said Union duties do not deter the stewards from satisfactorily performing their regular job duties and do not result in an unreasonable amount of time being spent on Union business.

 17.4 The parties to this agreement recognize the value to both the Union and the City of having employees express their perspectives as part of the negotiations process. Therefore, effective January 1, 2005, employees who participate in the bargaining as part of the Union's bargaining team during the respective employee's work hours shall remain on paid status, without the Union having to reimburse the City for the cost of their time, PROVIDED the following conditions are met:

Additionally, the parties agree that shift adjustments will be accommodated to allow the Union's bargaining team to participate in negotiations.

 A.

 This provision shall automatically become null and void with the expiration of the collective bargaining agreement, shall not constitute the status quo, and shall not become a part of any successor agreement unless it is explicitly renegotiated by the parties.

 17.5 City work hours shall not be used by employees or Union representatives for the conduct of Union business or the promotion of Union affairs other than as provided in this Article, Article 5, Grievance Procedure, and Article 16, Labor-Management Conference Committee, and no City property or facilities, including vehicles, shall be used for Union business or any other non-City purpose. Except: conference rooms may be used for Union business provided such usage does not interfere with City work, does not occur during City work time, and is used with prior management approval.

 17.6 Shop stewards and employees shall not be discriminated against for making a complaint or giving evidence with respect to an alleged violation of any provision of this Agreement, but under no circumstances shall stewards interfere with orders of the employer or unilaterally change working conditions.

 17.7 Upon request and not more than three (3) times per year, the Employer shall furnish the Union a listing of all active employees within the bargaining unit.

 17.8 The City shall provide bulletin board space for the use of the Union in areas accessible to the members of the bargaining unit.

If there is more than one employee eligible to transfer, in lieu of layoff, in the same job title, the employee names shall be placed on a Layoff Transfer List in order of job class seniority. Eligibility to choose this opportunity to transfer is limited to those employees who have no rights to other positions in the application of the layoff language herein including Section 19.5C.

 B. However, the City may lay off out of the order described above for one or more of the reasons cited below:

 1. Upon showing by the appointing authority that the operating needs of the department require a special experience, training, or skill.

 2. When (1) women or minorities are substantially underrepresented in an EEO category within a department; or (2) a planned layoff would produce substantial underrepresentation of women or minorities; and (3) such layoff in normal order would have a negative, disparate impact on women or minorities; then the Personnel Director shall make the minimal adjustment necessary in the order of layoff in order to prevent the negative disparate impact.

 C. At the time of layoff, a regular employee or a trial service employee (per 19.5A(4) above) shall be given an opportunity to accept reduction(bump) to the next lower class in a series of classes in their department or they may be transferred as provided in Section 19.1C4.

 4. Regular employees laid off from the same classification in another City department and regular employees on a Layoff Transfer List. The regular employee on this combined list who has the most service credit and who has the job skills necessary for the vacant position will be offered employment on a trial basis in said vacancy. The trial service provisions of Article 20, Section 20.4, shall apply.

 5. Trial service employees laid off from the same classification in another City department and trial service employees on a Layoff Transfer List.

 7. The City may recall laid-off employees out of the order described above upon showing by the appointing authority that the operating needs of the department require such experience, training, or skill.

 8. The Union agrees that employees from other bargaining units whose names are on the Reinstatement Recall List for the same classifications shall be considered in the same manner as employees of this bargaining unit, provided the Union representing those employees has agreed to a reciprocal right to employees of this bargaining unit. Otherwise, this Section shall only be applicable to those positions that are covered by this Agreement.

 H. Nothing in this Article shall prevent the reinstatement of any regular, trial service, or probationary employee for the purpose of appointment to another lateral title or for voluntary reduction in class, as provided in this Article.

 19.6 A. For purposes of layoff, service credit in a class for a regular employee shall be computed to cover all service subsequent to their regular appointment to a position in that class, and shall be applicable in the department in which employed and specifically as follows:

 B. General Provisions:

 1. After completion of the probationary period, service credit will be given for employment in the same, an equal or higher class, including service in other departments, and shall include temporary or intermittent employment in the same class under regular appointment prior to the regular appointment;

 2. For any employment prior to a separation from the Civil Service other than by a resignation that has been withdrawn within sixty (60) days from the effective date of the resignation and such request for withdrawal bears the favorable recommendation of the appointing authority and is approved by the Personnel Director.

 19.7 The City agrees to support employees facing layoff by providing the Project Hire program during the term of this Agreement. If a department is hiring for a position in which the employee is qualified, and if no business reason would otherwise make the employee unsuitable for employment, the employee will be interviewed for the vacancy. This provision does not create any guarantee or entitlement to any position. The Project Hire guidelines apply.

 ARTICLE 20 - PROBATIONARY PERIOD AND TRIAL SERVICE PERIOD

 20.1 The following shall define terms used in this Article:

 Probationary Period - A twelve- (12) month period of employment following an employee's initial regular appointment within the Civil Service to a position.

 Regular Appointment - The authorized appointment of an individual to a position in the Civil Service.

 Trial Service Period/Regular Subsequent Appointment - A twelve- (12) month trial period of employment of a regular employee beginning with the effective date of a subsequent, regular appointment from one classification to a different classification in which the employee has not successfully completed a probationary or trial service period or rehire from a Reinstatement Recall List to a department other than that from which the employee was laid off.

 Regular Employee - An employee who has successfully completed a twelve- (12) month probationary period and has had no subsequent break in service as occasioned by quit, resignation, discharge for just cause, or retirement.

 Revert - To return an employee who has not successfully completed his/her trial service period to a vacant position in the same class and former department (if applicable) from which he/she was appointed.

 Reversion Recall List - If no such vacancy exists to which the employee may revert, he/she will be removed from the payroll and his/her name placed on a Reversion Recall List for the class/department from which he/she was removed.

 20.2 Probationary Period/Status of Employee - Employees who are initially appointed to a position shall serve a probationary period of twelve (12) months.

 A. The probationary period shall provide the department with the opportunity to observe a new employee's work, to train and aid the new employee in adjustment to the position, and to terminate any employee whose work performance fails to meet the required standards.

 B. An employee shall become regular after having completed his/her probationary period unless the individual is dismissed under provisions of Section 20.3 and 20.3A below.

 20.3 Probationary Period/Dismissal - An employee may be dismissed during his/her probationary period after having been given written notice five (5) working days prior to the effective date of dismissal. However, if the department believes the best interest of the City requires the immediate dismissal of the probationary employee, written notice of only one (1) full working day prior to the effective date of the dismissal shall be required. The reasons for the dismissal shall be filed with the Director of Personnel and a copy sent to the Union.

 A. An employee dismissed during his/her probationary period shall not have the right to appeal the dismissal. When proper advance notice of the dismissal is not given, the employee may enter an appeal (for payment of up to five [5] days' salary), which the employee would have otherwise received had proper notice been given. If such a claim is sustained, the employee shall be entitled to the appropriate payment of salary but shall not be entitled to reinstatement.

 20.4 Trial Service Period - An employee who has satisfactorily completed his/her probationary period and who is subsequently appointed to a position in another classification shall serve a twelve- (12) month trial service period, in accordance with Section 20.1.

 A. The trial service period shall provide the department with the opportunity to observe the employee's work and to train and aid the employee in adjustment to the position, and to revert such an employee whose work performance fails to meet required standards.

 B. An employee who has been appointed from one classification to another classification within the same or different department and who fails to satisfactorily complete the trial service period shall be reverted to a vacant position within that department and classification from which he/she was appointed.

 C. Where no such vacancy exists, such employee shall be given fifteen (15) calendar days' written notice prior to being placed on a Reversion Recall List for his/her former department and former classification and being removed from the payroll.

 D. Employees who have been reverted during the trial service period shall not have the right to appeal the reversion.

 E. The names of regular employees who have been reverted for purposes of reemployment in their former department shall be placed upon a Reversion Recall List for the same classification from which they were promoted or transferred for a period of one (1) year from the date of reversion.

 F. If a vacancy is to be filled in a department and a valid Reversion Recall List for the classification for that vacancy contains the name(s) of eligible employees who have been removed from the payroll from that classification and from that department, such employees shall be reinstated in order of their length of service in that classification. The employee who has the most service in that classification shall be the first reinstated.

 G. An employee whose name is on a valid Reversion Recall List for a specific job classification who accepts employment with the City in that same job classification shall have his/her name removed from the Reversion Recall List. Refusal to accept placement from a Reversion Recall List to a position the same, or essentially the same, as that which the employee previously held shall cause an employee's name to be removed from the Reversion Recall List, which shall terminate rights to reemployment under this Reversion Recall List provision.

 H. A reverted employee shall be paid at the step of the range that he/she normally would have received had he/she not been promoted or transferred.

 20.5 Subsequent Appointments During Probationary Period or Trial Service Period - If a probationary employee is subsequently appointed in the same classification from one department to another, the receiving department may, with approval of the Personnel Director, require that a complete twelve- (12) month probationary period be served in that department. If a regular employee or an employee who is serving a trial service period is subsequently appointed in the same classification from one department to another, the receiving department may, with the approval of the Personnel Director, require that a twelve- (12) month trial service period be served in that department.

 A. If a probationary employee is subsequently appointed to a different classification in the same or different department, the employee shall serve a complete twelve- (12) month probationary period in the new classification. If a regular employee is subsequently appointed to a different classification in the same or different department, the employee shall serve a complete twelve- (12) month trial service period in the new classification.

 B. Within the same department, if a regular employee is appointed to a higher classification while serving in a trial service period, the trial service period for the lower classification and the new trial service period for the higher classification shall overlap provided that the higher and lower classifications are in the same or a closely related field. The employee shall complete the terms of the original trial service period and be given regular status in the lower classification. Such employee shall also be granted the rights normally accruing to trial service for the remainder of the trial service period in the higher classification.

 C. Within the same department, if a probationary employee is regularly appointed to a higher classification while serving in a probationary period, the probationary period and the new trial service period for the higher classification shall overlap provided the higher and the lower classifications are in the same or a closely related field. The employee shall complete the term of the original probationary period and be given regular standing in the lower class. Such employee shall also be granted the rights normally accruing to trial service for the remainder of the trial service period in the higher classification.

 20.6 The probationary period shall be equivalent to twelve (12) months of service following regular appointment. Occasional absences due to illness, vacations, jury duty, and military leaves shall not result in an extension of the probationary period, but upon approval of the Personnel Director, an employee's probationary period may be extended so as to include the equivalent of a full twelve (12) months of actual service where there are numerous absences.

 20.7 Nothing in this Article shall be construed as being in conflict with provisions of Article 19.

 ARTICLE 21 - SAVINGS CLAUSE

 21.1 If an article of this Agreement or any addenda thereto should be held invalid by operation of law or by any tribunal of competent jurisdiction, or if compliance with or enforcement of any article should be restrained by such tribunal, the remainder of this Agreement and addenda shall not be affected thereby, and the parties shall enter into immediate collective bargaining negotiations for the purpose of arriving at a mutually satisfactory replacement for such article.

 21.2 If the City Charter is modified during the term of this Agreement and any modifications thereof conflict with an express provision of this Agreement, the City and/or the Union may reopen, at any time, for negotiations of the provisions so affected.

 ARTICLE 22 - ENTIRE AGREEMENT

 22.1 The Agreement expressed herein in writing constitutes the entire Agreement between the parties and no oral statement shall add to or supersede any of its provisions, provided; however, that the parties intend that their signed official bargaining notes and signed written agreements entered into during the course of bargaining shall have legal effect.

 22.2 The parties acknowledge that each has had the unlimited right and opportunity to make demands and proposals with respect to any matter deemed a proper subject for collective bargaining. The results of the exercise of that right are set forth in this Agreement. Therefore, except as otherwise provided in this Agreement, each party voluntarily and unqualifiedly agrees to waive the right to oblige the other party to bargain with respect to any subject or matter whether or not specifically referred to or covered in this Agreement.

 ARTICLE 23 - SUBORDINATION OF AGREEMENT

 23.1 It is understood that the parties hereto and the employees of the City are governed by the provisions of applicable federal law, state law, and the City Charter. When any provisions thereof are in conflict with or different from the provisions of this Agreement, the provisions of said federal law, state law, or City Charter are paramount and shall prevail.

 APPENDIX B

 B.1 VEBA

 A. Employees who are eligible to retire during the term of this contract shall participate in a vote administered by the union to determine if the Voluntary Employee Benefits Association (VEBA) benefit shall be offered to employees who elect to retire during the term of this contract. The VEBA benefit allows employees who are eligible to retire from City Service to cash out their unused sick leave balance upon retirement and place it in a VEBA account to be used for post-retirement healthcare costs as allowed under IRS regulations.

 a. Eligibility-to-Retire Requirements:

 * 5 - 9 years of service and are age 62 or older

 * 10 - 19 years of service and are age 57 or older

 * 20 - 29 years of service and are age 52 or older

 * 30 years of service and are any age

 For purposes of identifying all potential eligible-to-retire employees, the City shall create a list of members who are in the City's HRIS system as age 45 or older as of the final day of the contract term and provide this list to the union so that the union can administer the vote.

 If the eligible-to-retire members of the bargaining unit vote to accept the VEBA, then all members of the bargaining unit who retire during the term of this contract, shall either:

 a. place their sick leave cashout at 35% into their VEBA account, or

 b. forfeit the sick leave cash out altogether. There is no minimum threshold for the sick leave cash out.

 Members are not eligible to deposit their sick leave cashout into their deferred compensation account or receive cash.

 B. Sabbatical Leave and VEBA: Members of a bargaining unit that votes to accept the VEBA and who meet the eligible-to-retire criteria are not eligible to cash out their sick leave at 25% as a part of their sabbatical benefit. Members who do not meet the eligible-to- retire criteria may cash out their sick leave at 25% in accordance with the sabbatical benefit.

 B.2 Supplemental Pension Plan. The City agrees to assess, on the basis of a specific proposal made by a Coalition Union either as part of the Coalition coordinated bargaining process or as part of the individual contract negotiations with a given Union, the acceptability to the City of a given supplemental pension proposal as a policy matter and respond promptly to the Union making such a proposal whether, and/or under what conditions, such a proposal would be acceptable.

 B.4 Eligible Family Member. The definition of "Eligible family member" contained in SMC 4.24.005 shall be amended by the elimination of the existing phrase "who is (a) under eighteen (18) years of age; or (b) eighteen (18) years of age or older and incapable of self care because of a mental or physical disability" and the addition of the word "sibling."

 The expressed purpose for the proposed modification of said definition shall be to allow an employee to use sick leave because of an illness, injury, or health care appointment of an employee's sibling or adult child, or the sibling or adult child of an employee's spouse or domestic partner, in instances where the absence of the employee from work is required, or when such absence is recommended by a health care provider.
