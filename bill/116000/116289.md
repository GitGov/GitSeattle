 AN ORDINANCE relating to land use and zoning; amending Chapter 23.32 of the Seattle Municipal Code at page 112 of the Official Land Use Map (Vol. 8 of Plats, Page 68, Records of King County), to rezone property located at 2203 East Union Street from Neighborhood Commercial 2 Pedestrian with a 40 foot height limit (NC2P-40) to Neighborhood Commercial 2 Pedestrian with a 65-foot height limit (NC2P-65), accepting a Property Use and Development Agreement in connection therewith, and modifying parking requirements. (Jim Mueller, C.F. 308565, DPD Project 3005925)

 BE IT ORDAINED BY THE CITY OF SEATTLE AS FOLLOWS:

 Section 1. This Ordinance affects the following legally described property (the "Property"), commonly known as 2203 East Union Street:

 Lot 1 and the north one-half of lot 2, Block 7, Renton Hill Addition to the City of Seattle, according to the plat thereof recorded in Volume 8 of Plats, page 68, records of King County, Washington.

 Section 2. The Official Land Use Map zone classification for the Property, established on page 112 of the Official Land Use Map, as adopted by Ordinance 110381 and last modified by Ordinance 122727, is amended to rezone the Property from Neighborhood Commercial 2 Pedestrian with a 40 foot height limit (NC2P-40) to Neighborhood Commercial 2 Pedestrian with a 65-foot height limit (NC2P-65) as shown in "Exhibit A," attached to this Ordinance. The Official Land Use Map zone classification is conditioned upon performance and continued compliance with the conditions of the Property Use and Development Agreement referenced in Section 3.

 Section 3. The Property Use and Development Agreement, attached to this Ordinance as "Exhibit B," executed by 2203 East Union L.L.C., owner ("Owner") of the Property, by which said Owner agrees to certain restrictions upon the use and development of the Property to ameliorate the adverse impacts of uses and developments that would otherwise be permitted in the NC2P-65 zone, which restrictions are directly related to the impacts expected to result from the rezone, is hereby approved and accepted.

 Section 4. The City Council determines that reduction of the number of required parking spaces from 95 to 74 is necessary to achieve a better development than would otherwise result from the application of regulations of the zone, and that the reduction would not be materially detrimental to the public welfare or injurious to property in the zone or vicinity in which the Property is located. Pursuant to Seattle Municipal Code Section 23.34.004 B, the number of parking spaces required for the development is reduced from 95 to 74.

 Section 5. The rezone approval of the Property expires, pursuant to Section 23.76.060 B of the Seattle Municipal Code, two (2) years from the effective date of approval, unless, within the two (2) year period, an application is filed for a Master Use Permit, which permit is subsequently issued. If the Master Use Permit is subsequently issued, the rezone approval expires when the Master Use Permit expires pursuant to Section 23.76.032. If the Master Use permit is issued and the owner has received a permanent certificate of occupancy for the entire project prior to expiration of the Master Use Permit, the rezone remains in effect unless revoked pursuant to Section 23.34.004.

 Section 6. The City Clerk is hereby authorized and directed to file said Property Use and Development Agreement, attached to this ordinance as Exhibit B, at the King County Records and Elections Division; to file, upon return of the recorded agreement from the King County Records and Elections Division, the original of said Property Use and Development Agreement with this Ordinance at the City Clerk's Office; and to deliver copies of the same to the Director of the Department of Planning and Development and to the King County Assessor's Office.

 Section 7. This Ordinance, effectuating a quasi-judicial decision of the City Council and not subject to mayoral approval or disapproval, shall take effect and be in force thirty (30) days from and after its passage and approval by the City Council.

 Passed by the City Council the ____ day of ________________________, 2008, and signed by me in open session in authentication of its passage this
