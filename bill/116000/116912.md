 BE IT ORDAINED BY THE CITY OF SEATTLE AS FOLLOWS:

 Section 1. Section 22.110.010 of the Seattle Municipal Code, which section was last amended by Ordinance 122529, is amended as follows:

 22.110.010 Adoption of International Existing Building Code((~~.~~))

 The Seattle Existing Building Code consists of the following portions of the ((~~2006~~))  2009  edition of the International Existing Building Code ((~~and errata published by the International Code Council~~)): Chapters 2 through 10, Chapters 12, 13, 15, and Appendix A, together with Chapter 1 and the amendments and additions adopted by ordinance. One copy of the ((~~2006~~))  2009  International Existing Building Code is filed with the City Clerk in C.F. ((~~308937~~))  310928 .

 Section 2. The following is adopted as Chapter 1 of the Seattle Existing Building Code and reads as follows:

 Chapter 1

 ADMINISTRATION

 SECTION 101 GENERAL

 101.1 Title. This subtitle shall be known as the "Seattle Existing Building Code."

 101.2 Applicability. If requested by the permit applicant, this code applies as a code alternate to Chapter 34 of the Seattle Building Code for alteration, change of occupancy, relocation of and additions to existing buildings as defined in Chapter 2.

 Exceptions:

 1. Buildings within the scope of the International Residential Code shall comply with the International Residential Code.

 2. Buildings undergoing substantial alteration as defined in the Seattle Building Code shall comply with the Seattle Building Code.

 3. Repairs shall comply with the Seattle Building Code.

 4. Historic buildings shall comply with the Seattle Building Code.

 101.2.1 Compliance with other codes. Although this code may apply as an alternate to Chapter 34 of the Seattle Building Code for alterations, changes of occupancy, relocation and additions to certain existing buildings, compliance with the applicable provisions of other codes, including but not limited to the Washington State Energy Code with Seattle Amendments and the Seattle Electrical Code, is also required.

 [W] 101.2.2 Fire prevention. Except as specifically provided for in this Code, the provisions of the International Fire Code shall apply to matters affecting or relating to structures, processes and premises regarding:

 1. The hazard of fire and explosion arising from the storage, handling or use of structures, materials or devices;

 2. conditions hazardous to life, property or public welfare in the occupancy of structures or premises; and

 3. the construction, extension, repair, alteration or removal of fire suppression and alarm systems or fire hazards in the structure or on the premises from occupancy or operation.

 [W] 101.2.3 Buildings not previously occupied. A building or portion of a building that has not been previously occupied or used for its intended purpose in accordance with the laws in existence at the time of its completion shall comply with the provisions of the International Building Code for new construction or with any current permit for such occupancy.

 101.2.4 Buildings previously occupied. The legal occupancy of any building existing on the date of adoption of this code is permitted to continue without change, except as specifically provided otherwise in this code, the International Fire Code, or the Seattle Housing and Building Maintenance Code, or as deemed necessary by the code official to correct an unsafe building. For the purpose of this section, "unsafe building" is not a mere lack of compliance with the current code.

 101.3 Purpose.

 101.3.1 General. The purpose of this code is to provide minimum standards to safeguard life or limb, health, property and public welfare by regulating and controlling the design, construction, quality of materials, occupancy, location and maintenance of certain existing buildings and structures within the City and certain equipment in those buildings, as specifically regulated herein.

 101.3.2 Protection of the public. The purpose of this code is to provide for and promote the health, safety and welfare of the general public, and not to create or otherwise establish or designate any particular class or group of persons who will or should be especially protected or benefited by the terms of this code.

 101.3.3 Flexibility. The intent of this code is to provide flexibility for the use of alternative approaches to achieve compliance with minimum requirements to safeguard the public health, safety and welfare insofar as they are affected by the alteration, change of occupancy, addition and relocation of certain existing buildings.

 101.4 Internal Consistency. If in any specific case, different sections of this code specify different materials, methods of construction or other requirements, the most restrictive governs. If there is a conflict between a general requirement and a specific requirement, the specific requirement applies.

 101.5 Referenced codes. The codes and standards referenced in this code are considered part of the requirements of this code to the extent prescribed by each such reference. If differences occur between provisions of this code and referenced codes and standards, the provisions of this code apply.

 101.6 Appendices. Provisions in the appendices of the International Existing Building Code do not apply unless specifically adopted as part of this code with the exception of Appendix A, which is herein adopted.

 101.7 Metric units. Wherever in this ordinance there is a conflict between metric units of measurement and English units, the English units govern.

 101.8 Impracticality. In cases where total compliance with all the requirements of this code is impractical, the applicant may arrange a pre-design conference with the design team and the code official. The applicant shall identify design solutions and modifications that conform to Section 102.2 or 102.3. The code official may waive specific requirements in this code, which the code official determines to be impractical.

 101.9 References to other codes. Whenever an International, National or Uniform Code is referenced in this code, it means the Seattle edition of that code, including local amendments. References to the "Building Code", "Residential Code", "Fire Code", "Mechanical Code" and "Plumbing Code" mean the Seattle editions of those codes.
