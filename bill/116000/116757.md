 Attachment 1

 Bacon Creek Road No. 1060

 Right of Way Easement Deed

 THIS EASEMENT, dated this _________ day of _________________ , 2009, from the City of Seattle, a Washington Municipal corporation; herein called "Grantor", to the United States of America, hereinafter called "Grantee",

 WITNESSETH:

 Grantor, for and in consideration of reciprocal rights received by Grantor, does hereby grant to Grantee and its assigns, subject to existing easements and valid rights, a perpetual easement for a road along and across a strip of land, hereinafter defined as the "Premises", over and across the following described lands in the County of Skagit, State of Washington:

 Bacon Creek Road No. 1060 (Relocation)

 T. 36 N., R. 11 E., W. M.

 Section 21, W1/2NW1/4, NW1/4SW1/4,

 Said Premises are shown on the as-built centerline survey map attached and incorporated hereto and marked Exhibit A.

 The word "Premises" when used herein means said strip of land, whether or not there is an existing road located thereon. Except where it is defined more specifically, the word "road" shall mean roads now existing or hereafter constructed on the Premises or any segment of such roads.

 Said Premises shall be 30 feet on each side of the centerline with such additional width as required for accommodation and protection of cuts and fills. If the road is located substantially as described herein, the centerline of said road, as constructed, is hereby deemed accepted by Grantor and Grantee as the true centerline of the Premises granted. If any subsequent survey of the road shows that any portion of the road, although located substantially as described, crosses lands of the Grantor not described herein, the easement shall be amended to include the additional lands traversed; if any lands described herein are not traversed by the road as constructed, the easement traversing the same shall be terminated in the manner hereinafter provided.

 The acquiring agency is the U.S. Department of Agriculture, Forest Service.

 This grant is made subject to the following terms, provisions, and conditions applicable to Grantee, its permittees, contractors, and assigns:

 A. Except as hereinafter limited, Grantee shall have the right to use the road on

 the Premises without cost for all purposes deemed necessary or desirable by Grantee in connection with the protection, administration, management, and utilization of Grantee's lands or resources, now or hereafter owned or controlled. Grantee shall have the right to construct, reconstruct, and maintain roads within the Premises.

 Grantee alone may extend rights and privileges for use of the Premises to other Government Departments and Agencies, States, and local subdivisions thereof, and to other users including members of the public ("Users") in accordance with its applicable regulations and standard practices.

 B. Grantee shall have the right to cut timber upon the Premises to the extent

 necessary for constructing, reconstructing, and maintaining the road. Timber so cut shall, unless otherwise agreed to, be cut into logs of length specified by the timber owner and decked along the roads for disposal by the owner of such timber.

 C. Grantee shall be responsible for managing and controlling use, operations and performing all maintenance of the road on the Premises for public and administrative use in accordance with its applicable regulations and standard practices. Grantee will assist the Grantor in monitoring and reporting vandalism or other damage to the Premises or Grantor's adjacent property to the extent Grantee or its agents are or become aware of such damage.

 This easement is granted subject to the following reservations by Grantor, for itself, its permittees, contractors, assigns, and successors in interest:

 1. The right to cross and recross the Premises and road at any place by any

 reasonable means and for any purpose in such manner as will not interfere unreasonably with use of the road.

 2. The right to all timber now or hereafter growing on the Premises, subject to Grantee's right to cut such timber as hereinbefore provided.

 It is agreed that the Grantor shall have the right to use the existing road described herein for all purposes deemed necessary or desirable by Grantor in connection with the protection, administration, management, and utilization of Grantor's lands or resources now or hereafter owned or controlled, subject, however, to traffic control regulations of the Grantee in common with all other users of the road, and road maintenance fees assessed per ton/thousand board feet ("mbf") mile or equivalent in proportion to Grantor's or its contractor's use for commercial haul activities as Grantee may reasonably impose under its regulations. Grantee will not impose maintenance fees for Grantor's routine administrative (non-commercial) use of the road, which will be considered de minimus, unless such administrative traffic results in higher than normal maintenance costs to the Grantee. Grantee will not collect cost- recovery fees from the Grantor for costs incurred by Grantee for the  relocated segment of the road on the Premises since Grantor contributed funds to its construction.

 Grantee and Grantor are protected by their respective self-insurance liability programs. Each party to this agreement will be assigned and assume responsibility for any damages that are attributable to the negligent acts or omissions of that party or its representatives. Grantor and Grantee agree, to the extent permitted by law, to defend and protect the other party, its officers, agents and employees from any and all claims, costs, damages and expenses suffered due to each party's negligent actions or those of its agents or employees in the performance of this agreement, subject to the requirements of the Federal Tort Claims Act, as amended, and to the extent permitted by Federal law and regulation.

 If, at any time, the Regional Forester determines that the road, or any segment thereof, is no longer needed for public or administrative use and no Users exist which may require easements or permits under the Federal Land Policy Management Act ("FLPMA"), or appropriate similar easements or permits by the City of Seattle, this easement shall terminate and Grantee will decommission the road to its applicable standards, which will meet or exceed current state standards, unless agreed to otherwise by the parties. In the event of such determination, and upon completion of the decommission, the Regional Forester shall furnish to the Grantor, its successors, or assigns, a release in recordable form evidencing termination of this easement.

 IN WITNESS WHEREOF, Grantor has caused this instrument to be executed by its duly authorized officer on the day and year first written above.
