 ORDINANCE _________________

 AN ORDINANCE relating to the levy of property taxes; fixing the rates and/or amounts of taxes to be levied, and levying the same upon all taxable property, both real and personal, in the City of Seattle, to finance the departments and activities of City government and to provide for the General Obligation Bond Interest and Redemption requirements for the year beginning on the first day of January 2008; and by a vote of a majority plus one of the Seattle City Council, finding a substantial need to provide for the use of 106% as the regular property tax limit factor.

 WHEREAS, the Washington State Supreme Court issued a ruling on November 8, 2007, in which it found Initiative 747 unconstitutional, and which changes the limit factor by which the City may increase its property tax levy from a maximum of 101% to 106%; and

 WHEREAS, despite the effect of the Supreme Court ruling, the City will not exceed the previous limit factor of 101% effective in 2007; however, the City finds that there is a substantial need to preserve its levy capacity by setting a limit factor of 106%; NOW, THEREFORE,

 BE IT ORDAINED BY THE CITY OF SEATTLE AS FOLLOWS:

 Section 1. General Municipal and Firefighters' Pension.

 A. (i) There is hereby levied a tax on all taxable property, both real and personal, within the City of Seattle and subject to taxation under the laws of the State of Washington in the amount of Four Hundred Ten Million Twenty-five Thousand Two Hundred Seven Dollars ($410,025,207), which is calculated as $3.60 per thousand dollars of estimated assessed value of such property. This tax is levied for the purpose of raising revenue to finance the various departments and activities of the municipal government of the City of Seattle for the fiscal (calendar) year 2008. The following sentence is provided for information only: This levy has been calculated at the following dollar rates per thousand dollars of assessed value: Three Dollars and Thirty-seven and one-half cents ($3.375) for general municipal purposes as allowed by RCW 84.52.043 (which includes up to Twenty-two and one-half cents ($0.225) for the Firemen's Pension Fund as allowed by RCW 41.16.060); and Twenty-two and one-half cents ($0.225) for general municipal purposes and the Firemen's Pension Fund as allowed by RCW 41.16.060. This levy includes an amount of Three Million Seven Hundred Four Thousand Seven Hundred Twenty-two Dollars ($3,704,722) for low-income housing that is not restricted to serving very low-income households, in accordance with Ordinance 120823; an amount of Sixteen Million Six Hundred Eighty-four Thousand Dollars ($16,684,000) for educational and developmental services in accordance with Ordinance 121529; an amount of Twenty-two Million Three Hundred Seventy-eight Thousand Nine Hundred Sixty-three Dollars ($22,378,963) for neighborhood parks, green spaces, trails, and the Woodland Park Zoo in accordance with Ordinance 120024; an amount of Twenty-one Million Dollars ($21,000,000) for firefighting, life-safety and other emergency response facilities in accordance with Ordinance 121230; and an amount of Thirty-seven Million Sixteen Thousand Five Hundred Dollars ($37,016,500), for transportation purposes, both capital and operating, in accordance with Ordinance 122232.

 (ii) In addition, there is also hereby levied a tax on all taxable property, both real and personal, within the City of Seattle and subject to taxation under the laws of the State of Washington, in the amount of Eight Million Five Hundred Eighty Thousand Nine Hundred Ninety-two Dollars ($8,580,992), such tax being levied for the purpose of financing affordable housing for very low-income households pursuant to RCW 84.52.105 and pursuant to Ordinance 120823, which tax levy shall be outside of and in addition to the limitations in RCW 84.52.043.

 B. If the total of the amounts of taxes stated in subsections 1.A (i) and (ii), or the total of the tax rate stated in subsection 1.A (i) and the rate necessary to generate the amount of taxes stated in subsection 1.A (ii), would be in excess of any maximum allowed by law or approved by vote of the people of the City of Seattle pursuant to RCW 84.55.050, then such taxes shall be reduced to the amount to be determined as follows: (1) There shall be determined the amount of regular City property taxes that could have been levied for collection in 2008 had the voters approved none of the levy lid lift measures submitted pursuant to RCW 84.55.050 and Ordinances 120823, 121529, 120024, 121230 and 122232. (2) This amount shall be computed as One Hundred One percent (101%) of the general purpose regular property taxes levied for collection in 2007, plus the levy for tax refunds authorized by RCW 84.68.040 and RCW 84.55.070, plus the allowance for new construction and increases in state-assessed property value authorized by RCW 84.55.010 as calculated by the King County Assessor. (3) Then, to that total amount shall be added the five dollar amounts set forth in the last sentence of subsection 1.A (i) as authorized for 2008 collection in the approvals given by the voters of the City pursuant to RCW 84.55.050 and those enumerated ordinances, plus the dollar amount set forth in subsection 1.A (ii).

 Section 2. Pursuant to Chapter 3, Laws of 1997, as approved by the voters of the state on November 4, 1997, and pursuant to Resolution 30878 adopting the City Council's top budget goals for the 2007 and 2008 budgets, and in order to carry out those budget goals and the 2008-2013 Capital Improvement Program, the City Council finds that in order to be fiscally prudent and preserve future levy capacity there is a substantial need to use and hereby does use One Hundred Six percent (106%) as the regular property tax limit factor for regular property taxes to be collected in 2008.

 Section 3. Voter-approved excess taxes for bonds. In addition, a further tax is hereby levied to raise revenue to provide for the interest on and redemption of voter-approved general obligation bonds for the fiscal year 2008 in the amount of Twenty Million Seven Hundred Thirty-four Thousand Nine Hundred Thirty-five Dollars ($20,734,935). This tax is applicable to all taxable property within the City of Seattle.

 Section 4. Severability. The several provisions of this ordinance are declared to be separate and severable and the invalidity of any clause, sentence, paragraph, subdivision, section, subsection, or portion of this ordinance, or the invalidity of the application thereof to any person, property, or circumstance, shall not affect the validity of the remainder of this ordinance or the validity of its application to other persons, property, or circumstances.

 Section 5. Ratification and confirmation of prior acts. Any act consistent with the authority and prior to the effective date of this ordinance is hereby ratified and confirmed.
