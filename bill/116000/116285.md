 ATTACHMENT 1

 Form of FUNDING AGREEMENT

 THIS FUNDING AGREEMENT (the "Agreement") is made between THE CITY OF SEATTLE, a Washington Municipal Corporation (the "City"), acting through its Office of Housing, (the "Office of Housing") and UNITED WAY OF KING COUNTY, a Washington nonprofit corporation ("United Way").

 WHEREAS, City is a Washington municipal corporation, which administers a Bridge Loan Program ("Bridge Loan Program") to provide short-term funding ("Bridge Loans") to permit low-income housing development activities to proceed in advance of the availability of permanent project funding; and

 WHEREAS, the City's Office of Housing and United Way, subject to the City of Seattle Office of Housing and United Way of King County Bridge Loan Policies and Procedures ("United Way Bridge Loan Policies"), attached to this Funding Agreement as Attachment A., desire to increase the amount of short-term funding available in the Bridge Loan Program to support the development of permanent supportive housing for chronically homeless individuals; and

 WHEREAS, to increase the available funds in the Bridge Loan Program, United Way is willing to contribute funds to the City on a reimbursable basis on the terms and conditions specified in this Agreement;

 NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing and the mutual agreements contained herein, the parties hereto agree as follows:

 1. Contribution to Bridge Loan Program. The United Way hereby agrees to provide the City up to Five Million and 00/100 Dollars ($5,000,000.00) (the "Contributions"). The Contributions shall be deposited in the Office of Housing Low Income Housing Fund and may be commingled with other City funds. The Office of Housing will use the Contributions to fund Bridge Loans in accordance with the United Way Bridge Loan Policies. The United Way Contributions for 2008 will be an amount not to exceed $2 million.

 2. Repayment of Contributions. Upon receipt of any portion of an outstanding loan, City shall remit to United Way that percentage of the repayment that the United Way Contribution bore to the original combined Bridge Loan amount from United Way and City fund sources. City shall return those Contributions not previously repaid to United Way on ________________, 2013 (the "Due Date"); provided, however, that if a Bridge Loan borrower is in default on the Due Date, the Due Date shall be extended by one year and the City shall pursue available remedies under its bridge loan agreements

 3. Use of Funds. The Contributions shall be subject to the following conditions:

 a.) Funds shall be used solely to provide loans from the Office of Housing to nonprofit borrowers to support the development of permanent supportive housing for chronically homeless individuals within the City of Seattle to proceed in advance of the availability of permanent project funding.

 b.) Funds may be lent only when, in the judgment of the Office of Housing Director and the Chief Executive Officer of the United Way or his or her designee, the Office of Housing has assessed project developer capacity and eligibility, evaluated the project feasibility and loan risk and determined there is reasonable assurance that the funds will be used for eligible purposes and that permanent funding will be available on acceptable terms to ensure repayment of the funds before the Due Date (as it may be extended).

 4. Target Population Funds shall be used solely to support the development of projects that will serve chronically homeless individuals.

 5. Conditions to Loan. The United Way's obligation to make the Contribution shall be subject to the following conditions:

 a.) The City shall execute and deliver this Agreement and shall provide United Way with satisfactory evidence that the Contribution and this Agreement have been properly authorized by the Seattle City Council.

 b.) Funding decisions shall be consistent with the United Way Bridge Loan Policies attached hereto as Exhibit A, which may be amended from time to time with the written consent of the CEO of United Way and the Director of the Office of Housing.

 6. Default or Loss on Bridge Loans and Limits on City's Repayment Obligation. In the event of a borrower default, City will be responsible for making a reasonable effort to exercise the remedies under its loan documents to secure performance and to collect repayment of all bridge loans. If a borrower fails to perform and, despite reasonable efforts by City to secure repayment of site acquisition loans, there is a repayment of less than 100% of the amounts owed to City and to United Way, any shortfall will be allocated proportionally between City and United Way, based on a pro rata share of the amount due to each source of funds. United Way acknowledges that borrower repayment and loan collateral are the only source of repayment of the United Way Contributions, and that repayment is not an obligation of the City's general or other fund.

 7.) Subordinated Debt. United Way agrees that the Contributions may be used to make bridge loans that are subordinate to other creditors of the low income housing project. In these cases, the City shall seek prior approval from the United Way prior to making the bridge loan.

 8.) Reporting. The Office of Housing shall furnish United Way with a report of loan activity, in such detail as the United Way may from time to time reasonably request.

 9.) Relationship of Parties. The relationship of United Way and City is that of independent contractors and does not constitute a partnership, joint venture, or any other type of business organization. Neither party shall have any authority to act on behalf of or obligate the other party. The City assumes no fiduciary or other obligations to United Way except as are expressly set forth herein.

 In witness whereof, the parties have executed this Agreement as of the _______ day of __________________, 2008.

If a sponsor is unable to perform within reasonable time periods set by OH, OH will enforce the loan agreement to endeavor to either secure prompt performance by the sponsor, to facilitate a transfer of the site to another qualified sponsor for development as homeless housing, or to seek repayment of the loans made with OH and UWKC funds.

 b. If a sponsor fails to perform and, despite reasonable efforts by OH to collect repayment of site acquisition loans, there is a repayment of less than 100% of the amounts owed to OH and to UWKC, any shortfall will be allocated proportionally between OH and UWKC, based on a pro rata share of the amount due to each source of funds.

 c. In the event of default, foreclosure or extraordinary effort required by OH to assure repayment of UWKC loan funds from a borrower, or to facilitate the transfer of a site acquired with UWKC funds, UWKC will reimburse OH for a pro rata share of actual costs associated with securing the repayment or site transfer.
