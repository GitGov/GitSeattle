 AN ORDINANCE relating to City employment; amending SMC Section 4.24.035 and SMC Section 4.24.040 to revise the conditions under which sick leave may be used during a pandemic influenza outbreak; and ratifying and confirming prior acts.

 WHEREAS, public health experts have been predicting the recurrence of pandemic influenza for some time; and

 WHEREAS, the City of Seattle has formulated a disaster response plan to a pandemic influenza that involves the widespread closure of public venues and facilities, and cancellation of schools, daycare programs or other childcare services, in the case of such pandemic event; and

 WHEREAS, the Seattle Municipal Code identifies the local "Health Officer" as the Director of Public Health for the Seattle King County Public Health Department or a duly authorized representative; and

 WHEREAS, the City resolves to mitigate the hardship of those City workers with dependent children experiencing childcare service and school cancellations related to pandemic influenza, and those City workers required to use sick leave for absences from work for health reasons during a pandemic influenza outbreak; and

 WHEREAS, the Seattle City Council passed Ordinance No. 123087 in September 2009 attempting to address these issues, but the language of the ordinance was not effectual because the local Health Officer does not anticipate ever declaring a pandemic emergency, which was a condition for the use of sick leave and the modification of reporting requirements in Ord. No. 123087;

 NOW, THEREFORE,

 BE IT ORDAINED BY THE CITY OF SEATTLE AS FOLLOWS:

 Section 1. Seattle Municipal Code 4.24.035 shall be amended to read as follows:

 SMC 4.24.035 Paid Sick Leave - Use

 ***

 E. An officer's or employee's request for paid sick leave may be granted by the appointing authority or a designated management representative when the officer or employee is required to be absent from work upon cancellation of his or her child's school, daycare ~~facility~~, or other childcare service or program due to public health reasons related to ~~a~~ pandemic influenza~~emergency declared by the Local Health Officer or the Washington State Secretary of Health~~. The Mayor shall consult with the local Health Officer or the Washington State Secretary of Health prior to implementing this provision. Sick leave used for such purpose shall only be authorized for the duration of the cancellation, and for the employee to care for a child who is under the age of eighteen and who is a foster, biological, adopted or step child of the employee or the employee's spouse or domestic partner, or a legal ward or a child for whom the employee or his or her spouse/domestic partner stands in loco parentis and whose school or daycare or childcare service has been cancelled due to public health reasons related to ~~a~~ pandemic influenza~~emergency~~.

 Section 2. Seattle Municipal Code 4.24.040 shall be amended to read as follows:

 SMC 4.24.040 Sick Leave Reporting - Payment

 A. Compensation for absence of an officer or employee from duty for any reason contemplated in Section 4.24.035 shall be paid upon approval of such absentee's appointing authority or that authority's designee. In order to receive compensation for such absence, an officer or employee shall make himself or herself available for such investigation, medical or otherwise, as such appointing authority or the Personnel Director deems appropriate. Either such appointing authority or the Personnel Director may require a supporting report of a health care professional from the officer or employee. Compensation for absences beyond four (4) days shall be paid only after approval by such absentee's appointing authority or that authority's designee, of a request from the officer or employee supported by a report of the health care professional treating the officer or employee or an individual identified in SMC Section 4.24.035 A2, or by a health care professional selected by the Personnel Director. Upon request by the employing unit, an employee shall provide documentation verifying cancellation of his or her child's school, daycare ~~facility~~, or other childcare service or program for sick leave use as authorized in SMC 4.24.035 E.

 B. The requirements of providing supporting medical documentation from a health care professional set forth in SMC Section 4.24.040A for payment of sick leave authorized under SMC Section 4.24.035A to cover absences greater than four (4) days shall be waived by the Mayor on the advice of the local Health Officer for the duration of time that any schools, daycare programs, or other childcare services in King County are cancelled due to ~~a~~pandemic influenza~~emergency declared by the Local Health Officer or the Washington State Secretary of Health~~.

 Section 3. Any acts made consistent with the authority of this ordinance taken after its passage and prior to the effective date are hereby ratified and confirmed.

 Section 4. This ordinance shall take effect and be in force thirty (30) days from and after its approval by the Mayor, but if not approved and returned by the Mayor within ten (10) days after presentation, it shall take effect as provided by Municipal Code Section 1.04.020.
