 AN ORDINANCE relating to City employment, authorizing two lump sum salary payments to Police Recruits in the Police Department upon completion of certain threshold service hours in the Police Academy; defining eligibility for payment; designating to the Personnel Director the authority to continue such payments; and ratifying and confirming prior acts.

 WHEREAS, the City is committed to public safety, preventing crime, and providing quality police services and is committed to hiring additional police officers in the next three years to address ongoing efforts to fulfill these commitments; and

 WHEREAS, the Police Department has encountered difficulty filling Police Officer vacancies and the City requires competitive compensation in order to recruit qualified police officer candidates; and

 WHEREAS, the Police Department competes for talent in the highly competitive law enforcement profession; NOW, THEREFORE,

 BE IT ORDAINED BY THE CITY OF SEATTLE AS FOLLOWS:

 Section 1. Authorizing Two Lump Sum Salary Payments to Police Recruits. As recommended by the Personnel Director, an employee in the Police Recruit job classification shall earn two lump sum salary payments in addition to the Police Recruit's base salary at the following time intervals in the Police Academy: (1) upon completion of one hundred and twenty (120) straight time hours in the Police Academy, the recruit shall receive one lump sum salary payment of up to 32% of the Police Recruit's current pay in addition to the base salary earned to date, and (2) upon completion of the remaining six hundred (600) straight time hours in the Police Academy and upon successful completion of the Police Academy, but before the Police Recruit has taken his or her Oath of Office, the recruit shall receive a second lump sum salary payment of up to 32% of the Police Recruit's current pay in addition to the base salary earned to date. In no event shall the Police Recruit receive more than a total of $5,000 in lump sum salary payments. Each of the two lump sum salary payments shall be considered a part of regular compensation, for purposes of withholding retirement contributions and calculating retirement benefits.

 Section 2. Eligibility. Any Police Recruit employee who has begun service in the Police Academy as of November 1, 2007 but who has not yet taken his or her Oath of Office shall be eligible for both lump sum payments. The Chief of Police is authorized to issue the lump sum payments to eligible police recruits until December 31, 2010 and thereafter if the Personnel Director determines, pursuant to Section 3, that continuation of such payments beyond that date is appropriate.

 Section 3. Designating Authority to Personnel Director. The Personnel Director shall determine the appropriateness of continuing the lump sum salary payments to Police Recruits after December 31, 2010. The Personnel Director will indicate in writing to the Police Chief whether the payments should continue after December 31, 2010, and, if necessary, will review the appropriateness of continuing the lump sum salary payments every two years. Police Recruits in the program at the time the determination is made to end the lump sum salary payments who have not yet taken their oaths of office are entitled to the payments.

 Section 4. Prior Acts and Ratification. Any act consistent with the authority and prior to the effective date of this ordinance is hereby ratified and confirmed.

 Section 5. Effective Date. This ordinance shall take effect and be in force thirty (30) days from and after its approval by the Mayor, but if not approved and returned by the Mayor within ten (10) days after presentation, it shall take effect as provided by Municipal Code Section 1.04.020.
