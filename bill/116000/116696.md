 AN ORDINANCE relating to City employment; establishing a 2010 furlough program for certain employees not covered by collective bargaining agreements; extending the time employees laid off in 2009 and 2010 would be in Project Hire and on reinstatement lists from one year to two; and ratifying and confirming prior acts.

 WHEREAS, the City is experiencing revenue shortfalls due to the national economic crisis and is required to make substantial cuts to its operating budget; and

 WHEREAS, the City has identified furloughs as a way to reduce its operating costs and mitigate the number of layoffs required in the 2010 budget; and

 WHEREAS, for some employees the City may elect not to increase base salaries and require a reduced number of furlough days and achieve the same or greater reductions to its operating budget and

 WHEREAS, the City resolves to support its employees by creating a furlough program having the least possible impact on employment benefits and other working conditions and by extending the period of time that laid off employees may participate in job search and placement programs; NOW, THEREFORE,

 BE IT ORDAINED BY THE CITY OF SEATTLE AS FOLLOWS:

 Section 1. The Mayor is authorized to implement a furlough program for employees in the Executive branch of City government not covered by collective bargaining agreements. The Department of Finance will identify certain non-represented employees in the Executive Branch who shall participate in the unpaid furlough program. Some identified employees shall participate in 56 hours of unpaid furlough time in 2010, prorated for part-time employees. Those employees identified as participating in 56 hours of unpaid furlough time shall not receive a base salary increase in 2010. Other identified employees in the Executive Branch shall participate in 80 hours of unpaid furlough time in 2010, prorated for part-time employees. Those employees participating in 80 hours of unpaid furlough time shall receive a base salary increase. The Executive Branch departments shall schedule furlough days for employees participating in either a 56 or an 80 hour unpaid furlough on a department or work unit basis, according to each department's operational need.

 Section 2. The Seattle Municipal Court is authorized to implement a furlough program for its employees not covered by a collective bargaining agreement. Scheduling of furlough days for certain Seattle Municipal Court employees shall be determined by the Court on a department or work unit basis, and will be according to operational need. Seattle Municipal Court employees will be assigned furlough dates in 2010 to equal a total of 80 hours, prorated for part-time employees. Employees on alternative schedules shall schedule furlough days in order to equal a total of 80 hours (e.g., employees on 4/10s shall take eight furlough days of ten hours each). Furlough days will generally be scheduled on "premium days," which are the work days preceding and following City holidays, and on other available Fridays throughout 2010. Employees will not be required to take more than one furlough day within two consecutive pay periods.

 Premium days for 2010 are identified as: January 4, January 15, January 19, February 12, February 16, May 28, June 1, July 2, July 6, September 3, September 7, November 12, November 24, November 29, December 23, December 27, and December 30.

 Section 3. The Seattle City Attorney is authorized to implement a furlough program for employees in the City Attorney's Office not covered by a collective bargaining agreement. Some identified employees in the City Attorney's Office shall participate in 56 hours of unpaid furlough time in 2010, prorated for part-time employees. Those employees identified as participating in 56 hours of unpaid furlough time shall not receive a base salary increase in 2010. Other identified employees in the City Attorney's Office shall participate in 80 hours of unpaid furlough time in 2010, prorated for part-time employees. Those employees participating in 80 hours of unpaid furlough time shall receive a base salary increase. The City Attorney shall schedule furlough days on a department or work unit basis, according to the City Attorney's Office's operational need.

 Section 4. The Legislative Department is authorized to implement a furlough program for its employees. The City Council shall schedule furlough days on a department or work unit basis, according to the Legislative Department's operational needs.

 Section 5. Unpaid furlough time will accrue sick leave and vacation time.

 Section 6. Unpaid furlough time will not affect employee holiday pay or holiday benefits.

 Section 7. Unpaid furlough time will count towards the hours threshold used to determine the number of personal holidays received.

 Section 8. Employees whose pay is less than $18.00 an hour in 2010 may opt to use paid vacation, personal holidays, or compensatory time during their absence for a furlough day.

 Section 9. The City and employees will not make contributions to the City's Retirement System for unpaid furlough time, and employees will not receive service credit for retirement purposes for unpaid furlough time.

 An employee who is identified as subject to furloughs who plans to retire by December 31, 2012, shall be permitted to use vacation or compensatory time in lieu of furlough days, provided he or she submits a written notice of intent to retire to his or her Human Resources unit and consents to a payroll or leave deduction no later than December 31, 2010. Should such employee not retire by December 31, 2012, the employee shall return payment for the leave used on furlough days to the City either by pay or deduction of equivalent vacation or compensatory hours.

 Section 10. Medical, dental, vision and any other insured benefits coverage shall not be impacted by the furloughs.

 Section 11. Unpaid furlough time will not count as a break in service and shall not impact seniority, step placement, probationary periods or trial service periods.

 Section 12. Temporary employees and volunteers shall not be assigned to perform work to cover the time loss associated with furloughs.

 Section 13. The length of time an employee may participate in "Project Hire" and remain on the reinstatement list for a position from which he or she was laid off in 2009 or 2010 shall increase from one year to two years.

 Section 14. Any act consistent with the authority and prior to the effective date of this ordinance is hereby ratified and confirmed.
