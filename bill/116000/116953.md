 ORDINANCE _________________

 AN ORDINANCE relating to the Department of Parks and Recreation; authorizing the acquisition of real property commonly known as 719 North 35th Street; authorizing acceptance and recording of a deed for open space, park, and recreation purposes; authorizing acquisition by condemnation; and increasing appropriations to the Department of Parks and Recreation in the 2010 Budget; all by a three-fourths vote of the City Council.

 WHEREAS, Resolution 31055 created the Parks and Green Spaces Levy Citizens' Advisory Committee to ensure citizen participation in the development of a potential package of parks, open space, boulevards, trails, green infrastructure, and recreation projects, and a proposed set of options to fund the package; and

 WHEREAS, the Parks and Green Spaces Levy Citizens' Advisory Committee, after being duly appointed and after spending many hours in open meetings and receiving public testimony and deliberating on the levy, voted by a strong majority to recommend that the City Council place a $145.5 million six-year levy proposal for park purposes before the voters of Seattle; and

 WHEREAS, in response to this recommendation, the City Council passed Ordinance 122749, placing Proposition 2, the 2008 Parks and Green Spaces Levy before the voters of Seattle; and

 WHEREAS, the 2008 Parks and Green Spaces Levy was approved by Seattle voters on November 4, 2008; and

 WHEREAS, Ordinance 122749 identifies the Fremont Hub Urban Village for a potential neighborhood park acquisition; and

 WHEREAS, the Department of Parks and Recreation considers the Fremont Hub Urban Village as significantly underserved with quality open space and is, therefore, a priority for additional acquisition of parks and open space; and

 WHEREAS, a vacant site adjacent to A.B. Ernst Park is well- suited for open space, park, and recreation uses; and

 WHEREAS, the City has determined that the purchase of the property lying west of A.B. Ernst Park at 719 North 35th Street will augment an existing neighborhood park to meet the criteria to address open space needs established in Seattle's Park and Recreation Comprehensive Plan, Seattle's Parks and Recreation Plan 2000, and Seattle's 2006 Open Space Gap Report Update, and that it is in the public's best interest to acquire the same for open space, park, and recreation purposes; NOW, THEREFORE,

 BE IT ORDAINED BY THE CITY OF SEATTLE AS FOLLOWS:

The Property shall be accepted for open space, park, and recreation purposes, and placed under the jurisdiction of the Seattle Department of Parks and Recreation.
