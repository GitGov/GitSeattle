 Exhibit A: Public Bid Procedure for Disposing of Surplus City Owned Property

EXHIBIT A  Public Bid Procedure for Disposing of Surplus City Owned Property

 * The Fleets and Facilities Department (FFD) Real Estate Services Division has notified City departments and other public agencies of the property's availability and made a determination resolving any potential use proposed by a department or agency.

 * Notice of the proposed offering is given to property owners and residents within a one thousand (1000)-foot radius of each site and to neighborhood organizations. Comments are solicited about possible uses and the recommendation to sell the property prior to seeking authorization to sell. This notice and comment procedure is implemented in accordance with Council Resolution 30862.

 * The basis for disposing of property shall be by competitive bid. Each property is to be conveyed AS-IS, WHERE-IS, WITH-ALL-FAULTS, AND WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY WHATSOEVER, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED AS TO ITS CONDITION, ENVIRONMENTAL OR OTHERWISE, OR ITS SUITABILITY OR SUFFICIENCY FOR THE PURCHASER'S INTENDED USES AND PURPOSES. The City makes no representation or warranty whatsoever as to the condition of the property to be conveyed to the purchaser.

 * FFD shall prepare the form of a Quit Claim Deed, subject to Law Department review.

 * Bid packets shall include a brief description of each property offered, a neighborhood map, an Offer/Bid Sheet and a Quit Claim Deed. Copies of the bid packet and other related documents shall be available to prospective bidders on request.

 * Notice of the sale shall be given in general media publications including but not limited to the Seattle Daily Journal of Commerce and appropriate neighborhood newspapers, and further to all interested parties, by such means as determined to be reasonable, fair, and effective for the marketing of the property, including posted "For Sale" signs on each site.

 * Bidders will be required to submit a written bid no later than a clearly specified deadline date. The bid must be accompanied by bid deposit by cashier's or bank check in a reasonable amount to be determined by FFD. This bid deposit will be returned to unsuccessful bidders.

 * An acceptable price shall be a price above a threshold set by FFD below which it may reject any and all bids. The threshold will be based on an opinion of value expressed as a range, and will not be made public prior to the bid opening.

 * The successful bidder shall be the one offering the highest, acceptable price and agreeing to the terms of the Quit Claim Deed. The bid deposit of the successful bidder will be held by FFD. It will be applied to the purchase price at closing of the sale. If the successful bidder fails to complete purchase of the property, the bid deposit may be forfeited at the City's discretion. FFD may elect to sell the property to the next highest bidder above the acceptable price threshold.

 * If the FFD Director determines that a competitive environment did not exist for any property, the bid or bids may be rejected. FFD will evaluate whether to re-advertise or hold the property.

 * Bid documents will clearly state that the City reserves the right to cancel and all sales, to reject any and all Offers to Purchase or bids, and to discontinue the disposition process at anytime.

 * Sales will be completed within sixty (60) days after acceptance of the bid.
