 AN ORDINANCE related to the Restricted Parking Zone program to update and clarify the program; amending Sections 3.12.120, 11.14.515, 11.16.120(F) and (G), 11.16.315, 11.16.317, 11.16.319, 11.23.440, 11.28.010(D), 11.31.121, 11.72.351, 11.76.015, 15.04.112 and 23.44.041(A) of the Seattle Municipal Code; adding new Section 11.16.316; and repealing Sections 15.04.112 (B) and (C), 11.73.010-.040, and 11.73.080.

 WHEREAS, Ordinance 108354 established the Restricted Parking Zone program in 1979, for many years known generally as the residential parking zone program (or RPZ program) to help ease parking congestion in residential neighborhoods, and Ordinance 122853 amended the resident identification permit fees to cover the increased cost of administration; and

 WHEREAS, restricted parking zones (RPZs) are often located adjacent to generators of high traffic demand, such as universities, high schools, hospitals, transit stations or stops, and business districts in order to limit the impact of employees, transit commuters, and students parking their vehicles for lengthy time periods and thereby using parking that might otherwise be used by residents and area visitors; and

 WHEREAS, as of March 2009, Seattle has 27 restricted parking zones that operate seven days a week at varying days and hours, and the Seattle Department of Transportation (SDOT) issues approximately 17,000 RPZ permits annually; and

 WHEREAS, as part of this ordinance to update and clarify the RPZ program, Seattle Municipal Code Sections 11.73.010-.040 and 11.73.080 are repealed; however, while the Director of SDOT continues to have the authority to create, modify or dissolve RPZs as needed, repeal of SMC 11.73.010-.040 and 11.73.080 is not intended to affect the validity of existing RPZs, which the SDOT Director intends to retain as valid RPZs. The boundaries of theses zones can be reviewed at the SDOT RPZ permit counter; and

 WHEREAS, SDOT initiated a major policy review starting in 2007 to redesign the existing RPZ program to better achieve the City of Seattle's goals in areas of parking management, transportation, economic development, social equity, and sustainability; and

 WHEREAS, SDOT conducted a broad-based community engagement effort to generate feedback on draft recommendations issued in August 2008. As part of this effort, SDOT disseminated draft RPZ policy review recommendations to citizens, sought feedback from a broad range of stakeholders to help inform decisions, and, after an 80-day comment period, received over 500 comments from variety of residents, business owners and others;

 WHEREAS, exceptions may be needed to the four-permit per household limit for those land use zones that permit dwelling units that allow well in excess of eight unrelated occupants to reside as part of one household unit; and

 WHEREAS, the proposed amendments to the RPZ program are intended to support the following four objectives: reduce traffic impacts to neighborhoods from commuters who park around large parking demand generators; support mixed-use neighborhoods and local business districts by creating a pilot program for businesses and institutions and by broadening the community engagement program; continue to encourage a reduction in overall energy use and vehicle emissions by discouraging non- residents from parking in RPZ areas; and implement simple rules that are easily understood and clearly applied; and, NOW, THEREFORE,

H. The Seattle Department of Transportation will annually monitor and survey RPZs established under this pilot to determine utilization of parking spaces by residents and area businesses and institutions within each of the pilot RPZs.

In this subsection, the term "non- resident" includes businesses and institutions located in the area.

 I. The pilot program is intended to be in place no longer than four (4) years after its creation.

 SMC 11.16.317 Establishing, expanding,~~and~~ reducing, and dissolving restricted parking zones

A. The Director of Transportation or his or her designee shall consider whether a restricted parking zone, within a designated area, would promote certain benefits or would result in adverse impacts.

1. Benefits that may lead to establishing an RPZ may include, but are not limited to: increased access for area residents, reduced traffic congestion, increased traffic or pedestrian safety, reduced air or noise pollution, reduced commuter parking in neighborhoods, prevention of blighted areas, and promoting the use of alternative modes of transportation.

2. Adverse impacts that may prevent implementation include, but are not limited to: transferring a parking problem to a different area, inability to effectively enforce program restrictions, lack of alternative transportation modes, and availability of simpler, cheaper or more effective solutions.

3. Regardless of potential benefits or adverse impacts that may result from creating an RPZ in any downtown zone including all zones contained in Map 1A of Ch. 23.49 SMC, the Seattle Department of Transportation will not install RPZs in such zones, in part, because of high demand and multiple, competing needs for on-street parking.

~~A.~~ B. The Director of Transportation may establish a  new or expand an existing restricted parking zone whenever seventy-five (75) percent or more of the capacity of the streets available for parking on ten (10) contiguous blocks (and/or twenty (20) block faces) in such designated area is generally occupied; ~~during regular business hours or any consecutive eight (8) hour period during evenings or during any consecutive eight (8) hour period on both Saturdays and Sundays; at least twenty-five (25)~~over thirty-five (35) percent of the vehicles parked on the street in the area ~~during such hours~~ are not owned by residents of the designated area; ~~a petition signed by, or~~a strong and effective community engagement effort~~survey~~ indicating that~~,~~generally~~a majority of the residents~~stakeholders in the designated area have reviewed and support~~approves~~ the restricted parking zone, which could include a petition signed by a majority of the residents in the designated area in support of the restricted parking zone; and the public interest would be served. In cases where the criteria listed above are not ~~all~~ met, the Director of Transportation is authorized to establish a restricted parking zone when, in his or her judgment, the parking problem will be ameliorated by a restricted parking zone and the public interest would be served.

C. The Director of Transportation or his or her designee is authorized to engage affected and interested community stakeholders to review and assist in refining any future RPZ proposals.  1. The public information and involvement program may include department presentations to business and community organizations, information distribution through the City's web site, news releases and related media, direct mailings of informational materials, facilitated meetings, sounding boards, walking tours, surveys, and other techniques as appropriate to the scale of the proposal.

~~D.~~F. A restriction of parking shall take effect on a street segment when it is signed or posted, and shall cease when the signs or posting are removed pursuant to lawful order; provided, that vandalism or destruction of parking control signs shall not affect the validity of a restriction upon parking on any street segment designated by the Director of Transportation if other signs or traffic control devices give notice that parking in the street segment is restricted.

G. The Director may initiate dissolution of an RPZ when he or she determines that it best serves the public interest and meets at least one of the following criteria, including but not limited to, low permit sales in a zone, a small number of blocks with RPZ signs, or the original traffic generator no longer exists. The zone would be removed at the beginning of a new permit cycle.
