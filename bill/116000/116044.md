 WHEREAS, 720 cities have signed on to the United States Conference of Mayors Climate Protection Agreement; and

 WHEREAS, the Climate Protection Agreement urges state, local and federal governments to enact policies and programs to meet or beat the greenhouse gas emission reduction target set by the Kyoto Accord by 2012, which is a 7% reduction from 1990 levels by 2012; and

 WHEREAS, University of Washington climatologists in the summer of 2007 presented a report to the Seattle City Council explaining that the Pacific Northwest "is expected to warm more rapidly than the global mean for reasons having to do with wind and ocean circulation "; and

 WHEREAS, King County has enacted and is implementing an Executive Order to include a review of greenhouse gas emissions for projects that are subject to review under the State Environmental Policy Act (SEPA) ; and

 WHEREAS, The Seattle Climate Action Plan seeks to reduce Seattle's emissions of green house gases to meet the Kyoto Protocol target of 7% reduction from 1990 levels by 2012; and

 WHEREAS, The Council's proposed 2007 amendments to the Comprehensive Plan call for Seattle to exceed the Kyoto Protocol targets; and

 WHEREAS, the Master Builders Association of King and Snohomish County's Built Green Program has committed to supporting "resource- efficient homes . . . crafted to exceed building codes and provide homeowners with years of healthy, quality living, while protecting the precious Northwest environment," and

 WHEREAS, the United States Supreme Court has determined in Massachusetts v. Environmental Protection Agency, 127 S.Ct.1438, 167 L. Ed.2d 248 (2007) that greenhouse gases are a form of air pollutant, and that harms associated with climate change are serious and well-recognized; and

 WHEREAS, the quantification of greenhouse gas emissions for reviewing and assessing their climate impacts should be included in the preparation of environmental checklists by project proponents in response to checklist questions on impacts to the air, specifically, as to types of emissions to the air; and

 WHEREAS, the Seattle City Council passed, on July 23, 2001, a resolution supporting efforts to curb global warming, adopting greenhouse gas emission reduction goals for the City of Seattle, and calling for continuing and new actions toward achieving those goals;
