 AN ORDINANCE relating to financial policies for electric rate setting by the City Light Department, adding a new Section 21.49.087 to the Seattle Municipal Code; superseding a portion of Resolution 30933; and ratifying and confirming certain prior acts.

 WHEREAS, since 1977 City Light has set electric rates in compliance with specific financial policies adopted by City Council Resolution; and

 WHEREAS, Resolution 30933, adopted by the City Council on November 20, 2006, established long-term rate setting objectives and electric rate policies for the City Light Department, including financial policies to be followed for rate setting; and

 WHEREAS, these financial policies were established with the intent of maintaining the financial strength of City Light in light of the financial and operational uncertainty associated with its reliance on hydroelectric resources and a volatile wholesale market for surplus power; and

 WHEREAS, it is the Mayor's and Council's intent to maintain the financial strength of City Light while not increasing rates too sharply during the current economic recession by revising City Light's financial policies; and

 WHEREAS, the City Council intends to adopt financial policies for setting rates for the City Light Department that supersede the financial policies established in Section 4, subsection B, of Resolution 30933; NOW THEREFORE,

 BE IT ORDAINED BY THE CITY OF SEATTLE AS FOLLOWS:

 Section 1. A new Section 21.49.087 is added to the Seattle Municipal Code, to read as follows:

 SMC 21.49.087 Financial Policies for Rate Setting

 The City Light Department's revenues from electric rates shall be sufficient to meet the following financial policies. These policies shall serve as the basis for developing the City Light Department's revenue requirement analysis, unless modified by subsequent Council action.

 1. Debt Service Coverage. It is the policy of the City of Seattle to set electric rates at levels that will target debt service coverage of first and second lien debt of 1.6 in 2010, 1.7 in 2011, and 1.8 in 2012 and thereafter.

 2. Contingency Reserve Account. A Contingency Reserve Account in the amount of $25 million will be maintained in the Light Fund. Funds in the Contingency Reserve Account may be used to cover current obligations in any year in which the amount of net revenue available to fund capital requirements is not positive. Within two years of the withdrawal of funds from the Account, available net revenues shall be deposited in the Account until the targeted balance of $25 million is restored.

 3. Operating Cash Balance. In addition to funds in the Contingency Reserve Account, the City Light Department shall maintain sufficient operating cash balances in the Light Fund to absorb fluctuations in its operating cash flow. In its rate proposals, the City Light Department shall target a minimum month-end operating cash balance of $30 million.

 4. Debt-to-Capitalization Ratio. The City Light Department shall set rates to achieve a debt-to-capitalization ratio of 60% by year end 2012. The debt-to-capitalization ratio is the total amount of debt outstanding divided by the sum of the accumulated equity and debt outstanding.

 Section 2. Subsection 4.B of Resolution 30933 is superseded by this ordinance.

 Section 3. Any act authorized by the ordinance and taken after its passage is ratified and confirmed.

 Section 4. This ordinance shall take effect and be in force thirty (30) days from and after its approval by the Mayor, but if not approved and returned by the Mayor within ten (10) days after presentation, it shall take effect as provided by Municipal Code Section 1.04.020.

 Passed by the City Council the ____ day of _________, 2009, and signed by me in open session in authentication of its passage this _____ day of __________, 2009.
