 AN ORDINANCE relating to drainage services of Seattle Public Utilities (SPU); updating definitions; providing a rate discount for open space properties; and amending Chapters 21.33 and 21.76 of the Seattle Municipal Code.

 WHEREAS, drainage rates were last increased on January 1, 2008, as authorized by Ordinance 122517;

 WHEREAS, open space properties provide a benefit to the City's surface and storm water management system by retaining property in an undeveloped state; and

 WHEREAS, the City wishes to encourage the retention of property as open space by providing a drainage rate discount for those properties; NOW, THEREFORE,

 BE IT ORDAINED BY THE CITY OF SEATTLE AS FOLLOWS:

 Section 1. Section 21.33.010 of the Seattle Municipal Code is amended as follows:

 SMC 21.33.010 Definitions.

 For purposes of this chapter, the words or phrases below shall have the following meanings:

 A. "Approved stormwater management facility" means a drainage control facility or improvement installed and properly maintained on any parcel in the City subject to a drainage service charge that reduces or controls flow or improves water quality, or both, of stormwater flowing from all or part of the impervious surfaces on the parcel to the City's stormwater system, and which meets the technical design requirements for the drainage discharge point applicable to the parcel as more particularly described in the Stormwater, Grading and Drainage Code (Seattle Municipal Code 22.802) and SPU Director's Rules 03-00 and 04-00, as may be amended from time to time.

 B. "Billable area" means the total parcel area less any portion of the parcel which is exempt from drainage service charges pursuant to Subsection 21.33.030 A of the Seattle Municipal Code.

 C. "Billing year" means the calendar year that bills are sent. The first billing year shall be from January 1, 1989 through December 31, 1989.

 D. "City" means The City of Seattle.

 F. "Drainage discharge point" means the end or receiving point of the City's stormwater system that a parcel's stormwater flows to, which may include a combined or sanitary sewer treatment facility, a largebody of surface water, or a major creek basin, which dictates the type of stormwater performance goals and management facilities that may be required or accepted to manage the flow or quality, or both, of stormwater from that parcel.

 G. "Drainage service charge" means the fee for surface and stormwater management services imposed by the City upon all parcels of real property, except exempted properties, located within the boundaries of the City. The drainage service charge shall be calculated in accordance with Section 33.030 of this Chapter.

 H. "Drainage rate" means the dollar charge assigned to each rate category which shall be used in the calculation of the drainage service charge.

 I. "General service properties or parcels" means properties or parcels with no existing single family or duplex dwelling unit, including vacant properties, condominium complexes, townhouses, apartment buildings, and institutional, commercial or industrial properties.

 J. "Highly infiltrative pervious surface" means vegetated surface of specific types such as forests or non-forested land that is in the natural progression back to a forested state.

 K. "Houseboats and piers" means property or parcels that rest on or over natural bodies of water.

 L. "Impervious surface" or "impervious ground cover" means those hard areas which prevent or retard the entry of water into the soil in the manner that such water entered the soil under natural conditions pre- existent to development, or which cause water to run off the surface in greater quantities or at an increased rate of flow than that present under natural conditions pre-existent to development, including, but not limited to, such surfaces as rooftops, asphalt or concrete paving, driveways, parking lots, walkways, patio areas, storage areas, hardpan, compacted surfaces, or other surfaces which similarly affect the natural infiltration or runoff patterns existing prior to development.

 M. "Large residential property or parcel" means any single family residential property whose total area is 10,000 square feet or greater.

N. "Open space properties or parcels" means any General Service or Large Residential properties, parcels, or portions thereof classified for current use taxation under King County Code (K.C.C.) chapter 20.36 and chapter 84.34 RCW. This definition includes lands which have been classified as open space, agricultural or timber lands under criteria contained in K.C.C. chapter 20.36 and chapter 84.34 RCW.

~~N~~O. "Parcel" means the smallest separately segregated unit or plot of land having an identified owner(s), boundaries, and area as defined by the King County Assessor and recorded in the King County Assessor Real Property File or in the King County Assessor maps.

~~O~~P. "Percent of impervious surface" means the quotient of the total amount of estimated impervious surface located on the parcel divided by the parcel's total billable area. For purposes of rate category determination, the resulting amount shall be rounded to the nearest whole percent.

~~P~~Q. "Property owner of record" shall be the person or persons recorded by the King County Assessor to be the owner(s) of property and to whom property tax statements are directed.

~~Q~~R. "Rate category" means the classification of properties into groups based on their common characteristics (such as percentage of impervious surface), for purposes of establishing drainage service charges.

~~T~~U. "Small residential property or parcel" means any single family residential property whose total area is less than 10,000 square feet.

~~U~~V. "Stormwater facility credit" means a percentage credit, up to the allowable maximum, in accordance with Section 33.040 of this Chapter, which reduces the drainage service charge for a particular parcel because one or more approved stormwater management facilities are installed and maintained on the parcel that relieve some of the burden on the City's stormwater system.

~~V~~W. "Stormwater performance goals" mean the standards for

 1) water quality as shown by total suspended solids; 2) total volume; 3) two-year peak volume and duration; and 4) twenty-five-year peak volume as appropriate for the drainage discharge point as more particularly described in the Stormwater, Grading and Drainage Code (Seattle Municipal Code 22.802).

 Section 2. Section 21.33.030 of the Seattle Municipal Code is amended as follows:

 SMC 21.33.030 Drainage service charges and drainage rates -- Schedule -- Exemptions.

 A. A drainage service charge is imposed on every parcel within the City, and the owner(s) thereof, except for the following exempted property(ies):

 1. Houseboats and piers;

 2. That portion of a parcel that is submerged. If the parcel is entirely submerged, the entire parcel is exempt. If a portion of the parcel is submerged, only the submerged part will be exempt and the remainder of the parcel shall be billed as all other properties;

 3. City streets;

 4. State of Washington highways, so long as the State of Washington shall agree to maintain, construct and improve all drainage facilities associated with State highways as required by the Utility in conformance with all Utility standards for maintenance, construction and improvement hereafter established by the Utility and so far as such maintenance, construction and improvements shall be achieved at no cost to the Utility or to the City; and

 5. All other streets, so long as such streets provide drainage services in the same manner as City streets and the owner(s) shall agree to maintain, construct and improve all drainage facilities associated with such streets as required by the Utility in conformance with all Utility standards for maintenance, construction and improvement hereafter established by the Utility and so far as such maintenance, construction and improvements shall be achieved at no cost to the Utility or to the City.

 B. The drainage service charge shall be based upon a parcel's estimated contribution to City-wide surface and storm water runoff. A parcel's run-off is estimated based on its size and surface characteristics, including the amount and type of impervious and pervious surface it contains.

 C. Drainage service charges shall be determined as follows:

 1. Small single-family residential properties shall be assigned to one of four (4) flat rate categories based on a billable area. Within each category, properties will be charged a uniform annual drainage rate per parcel which is calculated based on an estimated average contribution of surface and storm water runoff for the category. The applicable drainage rate shall equal the drainage service charge.

 2. General service and large residential properties shall be assigned to a rate category based on the estimated percent of impervious surface contained within the parcel. Subsequently, properties assigned to the "undeveloped," "light," and "moderate" rate categories that also contain sufficient quantities of highly infiltrative pervious surface cover to meet Utility-defined performance requirements shall be assigned to a "low impact" rate category. A separate drainage rate shall apply to each general service and large residential rate category. The drainage service charge shall be calculated by multiplying the drainage rate, as determined by the parcel's rate category assignment, by the parcel's billable area (rounded to the nearest whole number of a square foot and divided by one thousand). For condominiums, the drainage service charge shall be determined for the entire parcel and then divided evenly among the owners. Present use code, site visits, planimetric maps based on aerial photography, and other information shall be used to estimate the percentage of impervious area.

 D. Drainage rates used in the calculation of drainage service charges shall be the sum of the treatment rate and the system rate, as follows:

 1. Treatment rate: The "treatment rate" shall be the rate required to pay the drainage share of "treatment cost" which is the cost of wastewater treatment, interception and disposal service, and any associated costs necessary to meet Drainage and Wastewater Fund policies. The treatment rate shall be the amount obtained when (a) the projected drainage treatment cost for each rate category is divided by (b) the projected number of billing units in each rate category and the result is multiplied by one hundred sixteen and three-tenths percent (116.3%) to cover the costs of taxes and low income rate assistance. The projected treatment cost shall be the treatment cost anticipated for the upcoming calendar year, which may include an adjustment to reflect the difference, whether positive or negative, between the drainage share of expected total treatment cost for the current year and the total drainage service charge revenues attributable to the treatment rate expected for the current year. The treatment rate is designed to pass through cost changes driven by King County and may be adjusted by ordinance at any time in response to such charges.

 2. System rate: The "system rate" shall be the rate required to fund the expense associated with operating, maintaining, and constructing the City's surface and stormwater management system, including any share of combined sanitary and stormwater system expense assigned to drainage.

 3. The rate categories and the corresponding annual drainage rates are as follows:

 4. SPU shall provide a 10% reduction in drainage rates for properties containing new or remodeled commercial buildings that, after July 27, 2003, install and utilize rainwater harvesting systems that meet the performance requirement that the systems are sized to use or infiltrate the amount of rain that falls on the roofs of such buildings during a one year, 24-hour storm event. A system that involves indoor uses of rainwater must be permitted by Seattle-King County Department of Health to qualify for the rate reduction. A system that relies solely on the capture and indoor use of rainwater shall qualify for the drainage rate reduction only if the system is sized to meet the performance requirement stated above. Qualifying for the drainage rate reduction does not relieve the property owner from the obligation to comply with applicable stormwater and drainage code requirements for the buildings and site.

5. Effective on the effective date of this ordinance, open space properties or parcels shall be charged only for the area of impervious surface and at the rate under which the parcel is classified using the total parcel acreage.

E. Each bill shall be rounded to the nearest cent. The minimum annual drainage service charge shall be Five Dollars ($5) per parcel.

 Section 3. This ordinance shall take effect and be in force thirty (30) days from and after its approval by the Mayor, but if not approved and returned by the Mayor within ten (10) days after presentation, it shall take effect as provided by Municipal Code Section 1.04.020.
