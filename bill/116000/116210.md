 AN ORDINANCE relating to taxicabs; increasing the taxicab regulatory license fees, inspection fees, and miscellaneous fees; restricting the transferability of new taxicab licenses; raising the maximum number of taxicab licenses issued by the City; imposing requirements concerning the issuance and maintenance of new taxicab licenses; restricting the conditions for lease of taxicabs; raising the minimum underinsured motorist coverages; providing for the regulation of taxicab licenses on vehicles subject to loans; revising obsolete provisions and terminology; adding new sections to the Seattle Municipal Code; and amending Sections 6.310.110, 6.310.150, 6.310.300, 6.310.320, 6.310.330, 6.310.340, 6.310.350, 6.310.450, 6.310.455, 6.310.460, 6.310.465, 6.310.470, 6.310.500, and 6.310.610 of the Seattle Municipal Code.

 WHEREAS, many of the taxicab license fees and inspection fees contained in SMC Chapter 6.310 have not been raised since 2005 and an increase in fees is necessary to cover the cost of the taxicab and for-hire vehicle regulatory program; and

 WHEREAS, the City has determined it is prudent for taxicab operators to carry underinsured motorist insurance coverage equal to the liability coverage specified in chapter 46.72 RCW; and

 WHEREAS, Seattle taxicab drivers who must lease taxicab vehicles have been negatively impacted by disadvantageous lease rates and conditions, and regulation of taxicab leasing practices will improve working conditions for the drivers; and

 WHEREAS, the City needs to prohibit the practice of subleasing taxicabs by drivers to ensure that all taxicab drivers are licensed and comply with the requirements of SMC Chapter 6.310; and

 WHEREAS, the City has issued nearly the maximum number of taxicab licenses currently authorized under SMC Section 6.310.500, and it is necessary to increase the authorized maximum number to meet current and future demand for efficient and economical taxicab service; and

 WHEREAS, to ensure that taxicab licenses can be secured by individual owners and drivers as well as by organized business entities, the City intends to restrict the issuance and transferability of any new taxicab licenses, and require the licensee to personally operate the cab a minimum amount of time, for five years following the issuance date; and

 WHEREAS, to encourage the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions in Seattle, the Director of Executive Administration seeks the authority to set vehicle standards and that will allow the Seattle taxicab fleet to move toward hybrid and alternative fuel vehicles for energy efficiency and pollution reduction; and

 WHEREAS, to encourage financial institutions such as those certified under the Community Development Financial Institution Fund to make loans to taxicab licensees for the purchase of environmentally-efficient vehicles, the City intends to regulate taxicab licenses for vehicles that are collateral for such loans and ensure that the lender approves of prospective license transfers; NOW, THEREFORE,
