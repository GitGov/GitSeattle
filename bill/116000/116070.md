 October 30, 2007

 Version # 1a

 Form Last Revised on December 16, 2006 5

 by and between the

 CITY OF SEATTLE

 and the

 COALITION OF CITY UNIONS

 October 3, 2007

Wages

2008 Effective December 26, 2007 -- 3.8% increase equal to 100% of the Local CPI-W average for June 2006 through June 2007

 2009 Effective January 7, 2009 --100% of the Local CPI-W average for June 2007 through June 2008, with a 2% minimum floor and a 7% maximum ceiling

 2010 Effective January 6, 2010 -- 100% of the Local CPI-W average for June 2008 through June 2009, with a 2% minimum floor and a 7% maximum ceiling

Health Care

 2008-2010

 The Memorandum of Agreement governing the Health Care Committee shall not be amended so that for the 2008 through 2010 contract years the following concepts shall continue to apply:

 1. The City shall pay up to one hundred seven percent (107%) of the City's previous year's costs to the extent required to cover increases in the total health care costs for a given program year (e.g. 2008, 2009 or 2010);

 2. The RSF shall be utilized for any given program year until it is exhausted to cover costs in excess of the City's obligation identified in 1, above;

 3. After the RSF has been exhausted, additional costs shall be shared by the City paying eighty-five percent (85%) of the excess costs and employees paying fifteen percent (15%) of the excess costs;

 4. Intent: Plan designs are to be maintained during this Contract, not to be diminished. The respective health care plan benefit designs may only be modified by the Health Care Committee for any contract year by the written, mutual agreement of the parties (Coalition of City Unions and the City);

 5. Intent: Should the parties agree to reduce premium costs, the reduction would apply to City as well as employee premiums. Use of resources from the RSF during any contract year to reduce projected increase in health care costs that exceed the resources provided through 1, above, shall be authorized only if applied to the total, annual premiums of the respective health care plan(s); and

 6. No decision by the Health Care Committee shall be permitted that modifies the established percentages established in 3, above.

Salary Adjustments

 The City agrees to enter into negotiations over salary adjustments for certain job titles as identified by the City and the Union as those tied to retention and/or recruitment issues and/or impact bargaining. Should the City and Union agree that a salary adjustment is warranted for these job titles, the effective date of such an adjustment shall not be before December 26, 2007, unless City and Union agree that impacts warrant an earlier effective date.

 The City agrees to enter into negotiations over salary adjustments for certain job titles as agreed to by the City and the Unions that did not result in adequate benchmarked salary data pursuant to the market analysis referenced below. Should the City and Union agree that a salary adjustment is warranted for these job titles, the effective date of such adjustment shall not be before December 26, 2007, unless the City and Union agree that impacts warrant an earlier effective date.

 The City and Unions agree that effective December 26, 2007, salary adjustments shall be implemented for those job titles that resulted in at least a 5% or more differential below the established market analysis as identified by the City and the Unions. The amount of salary adjustment for those job titles that were found to be at least 5% or more below the established market analysis shall be equal to the greater of the percentage below market as determined by either the "mid-point of the salary range" or "the median of the salaries". There shall be no additional negotiations over the amount of salary adjustment for the job titles.

 If any salary adjustment from the above referenced job titles result in wage compression within a classification series, the City shall bargain the new adjustment(s) for the affected classifications, effective on the date consistent with the above provisions.

 Transit Passes

Effective January 1, 2008, the City agrees to increase the current $15/month transit pass subsidy by $15/month for a total transit pass subsidy of $30/month.

 Effective January 1, 2009, the City agrees to increase the transit pass subsidy to an amount equal to the current monthly rate of a "one-zone" peak Puget Pass.

 Shift Differential Pay

 Effective upon signature of those collective bargaining agreements that provide for shift differential pay, the City agrees that those collective bargaining agreements shall express an increase shift differential pay to the following amounts: Swing Shift at $0.65 per hour and Graveyard Shift at $0.90 per hour. All other provisions relative to shift differential pay in the respective collective bargaining agreements shall not be amended.

Retirement

 All collective bargaining agreements established as a result of these negotiations shall contain a provision establishing that, if a year-end actuarial study commissioned by the Seattle City Employees' Retirement System (hereinafter, "System") finds that the amortization period for the System's unfunded actuarial liability exceeds thirty (30) years, the City and employees shall equally increase contribution rates to the System in an amount determined by the actuary to be needed to achieve a thirty (30) year amortization period.

 The required contribution rate increases shall take effect at the beginning of the first pay period of the year following completion of the actuarial study. For example, if the actuarial study for the System as of December 31, 2008 was presented to the Retirement Board in June 2009, and if that study showed an amortization period for the unfunded liability in excess of 30 years that the actuary determined required a total increase in contributions of one percent (1%) to meet the system's unfunded liability threshold, the City's contribution rate would increase by one-half of one percent (.5%) and the employee contribution rate would increase by one-half of one percent (.5%) at the beginning of the first pay period in 2010.

All other Economic Issues

The City and Unions agree that this agreement expressly resolves all issues that are associated with costs, except where negotiations provides cost offsets and/or where those negotiations pertain to titles as referenced above.

 Established this 3rd day of October, 2007.
