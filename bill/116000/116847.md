 The 2010 Citywide Position List

 The following list is the official list of regular positions for each department of the City of Seattle. The following information is adopted by the City Council for 2010: the number of regular positions by title, and whether these positions are part-time or full-time at the department level. For informational purposes, the list includes full-time equivalent (FTE) data. Temporary positions are not included in this list.

 Relevant definitions: Full-Time Equivalent (FTE): A term that expresses the amount of time a position has been budgeted for in relation to the amount of time a regular, full-time employee normally works in a year. For budget and planning purposes, a year of full-time employment is defined as 2,088 hours. A position that has been budgeted to work half-time for a full year, or full-time for only six months, is 0.50 FTE.

 Types of Positions: There are two types of positions authorized through the position lists. They are identified by one of the following characters: F for Full-time or P for Part-time.

 * Regular Full-Time is defines as a position budgeted for 2,088 compensated hours per year, 40 hours per week, 80 hours per pay period, and is also known as one full-time equivalent (FTE).

 * Regular Part-Time is defined as a position that has been designated as part-time, and that requires an average of 20 hours or more, but less than 40 hours of work per week during the year. This equates to an FTE value of at least 0.50 and no more than 0.99.
