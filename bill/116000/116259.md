 WHEREAS, in August 2007 the City Council adopted Resolution 31009 in support of the Mayor's appointment of an expert review panel to review the City's police accountability system, which panel became known as the Police Accountability Review Panel; and

 WHEREAS, the Police Accountability Review Panel concluded in its January 2008 Final Report that the general structure of the City's police accountability system should continue, but that overlapping responsibilities among and a lack of clarity in the roles of the Office of Professional Accountability (OPA), OPA Auditor and OPA Review Board undermine the effectiveness, transparency and accountability of the police accountability system as a whole; and

 WHEREAS, the Police Accountability Review Panel also made 29 recommendations to strengthen the police accountability system in the areas of accountability, public confidence, independence, professional conduct and transparency; and

 WHEREAS, among the major recommendations of the Police Accountability Review Panel were that the role and duties of the OPA Auditor should be clarified and expanded, that the OPA Director, OPA Auditor and OPA Review Board should agree on areas that will be the focus of enhanced review by the Auditor, and that the Review Board should be the primary link between the community and the police accountability system; and

 WHEREAS, the City Council concurs with the conclusions of the Police Accountability Review Panel, intends to clarify the roles of and relationships among the OPA, OPA Auditor and OPA Review Board, and intends to implement those Panel recommendations that require or warrant amendments to Seattle Municipal Code Chapter 3.28 Subchapters VII, VIII and IX; and

 WHEREAS, the City Council intends that the OPA Director, OPA Auditor and OPA Review Board work together not only in determining topics for the Auditor's enhanced review of policies and procedures, but also in supporting the Review Board's community outreach activities and in reviewing further potential improvements to the accountability system; and

 WHEREAS, the City has reached a collective bargaining agreement with the Seattle Police Officers' Guild that provides for the implementation of some of the recommendations of the Mayor's Police Accountability Review Panel; and

 WHEREAS, any provisions in the collective bargaining agreements and related memoranda of agreement between the City and the Seattle Police Officers' Guild and between the City and the Seattle Police Management Association that apply to the OPA, OPA Auditor or OPA Review Board are binding on the Guild or the Management Association and the City, including the OPA, OPA Auditor and OPA Review Board, and where there are any conflicts, the relevant collective bargaining agreement and related memoranda shall control rather than this ordinance; and

 WHEREAS, to the extent that provisions of this ordinance pertain to terms and conditions of employment that are subject to collective bargaining, this ordinance does not supersede the rights of collective bargaining agents to bargain over terms and conditions of employment, and those provisions will not be implemented until the duty to bargain is discharged.
