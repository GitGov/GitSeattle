 23.47A.032 Parking location and access

 * * *

 D. Exceptions to parking location and access requirements.

 1. Access to off-street parking may be from a street ~~when~~if, due to the relationship of an alley to the street system, use of the alley for parking access would create a significant safety hazard as determined by the Director.

 2. If a lot borders an unopened right-of-way, the Director may apply the parking access and location requirements as if that street did not border the lot if, after consultation with the Director of Transportation, the Director determines that the street is unlikely to be opened or improved. ~~~~3. On waterfront lots in the Shoreline District, parking may be located between the structure and the front lot line, if necessary to prevent blockage of view corridors or to keep parking away from the edge of the water as required by the Shoreline Master Program.

4. For fire and police stations, the Director shall determine the appropriate access to parking based upon needs of emergency and other vehicles and the configuration of the site.

E. When an existing building is proposed to be expanded, the Director shall determine the location of parking and access with the goal of minimizing the impact of parking and access along the front lot line.

 F. Access to a loading berth shall be from the alley if the lot abuts an alley improved to the standards of subsection 23.53.030.C, or if the Director determines that alley access is feasible and desirable to mitigate right-of-way impacts.

 G. Parking shall be screened according to the provisions of Section 23.47A.016.

 H. Surface Parking.

 1. Pedestrian access through surface parking areas. Where a pedestrian entrance to one or more general sales and service or major durables retail sales uses greater in the aggregate than 30,000 square feet is oriented to a parking lot, a 5-foot-wide pedestrian walkway through the parking lot to the pedestrian entrance shall be provided for each 50 spaces of parking provided.

 2. Surface parking separating the building from the street. Where a pedestrian entrance to one or more general sales and service or major durables retail sales uses greater in the aggregate than 30,000 square feet is oriented to a surface parking area separating a building from a street, at least one 5-foot-wide pedestrian walkway from the street to the pedestrian entrance shall be provided.

 Section 2. Subsection F of Section 23.54.030 of the Seattle Municipal Code, which section was last amended by Ordinance 122935, is amended as follows:

The number of permitted curb cuts ~~shall be~~is determined by whether the parking served by the curb cut is for residential or nonresidential use, and by the zone in which the use is located. ~~When~~If a curb cut is used for more than one use or for one or more live-work units, the requirements for the use with the largest curb cut requirements apply.

 1. Residential uses ~~in single-family and multifamily zones and residential structures in all other zones~~.

 a. For lots not located on a principal arterial ~~as~~ designated on ~~Exhibit A for 23.53.015~~the Arterial street map, Section 11.18.010, curb cuts are permitted ~~as follows~~according to Table A for 23.54.030:

 0 -- 80 feet 1

 81 -- 160 feet 2

 161 -- 240 feet 3

 241 -- 320 feet 4 For lots with frontage in excess of 320 feet, the pattern established in Table A for 23.54.030 continues ~~this pattern continues~~.

 b. Curb cuts shall not exceed a maximum width of 10 feet except that:

 1) One curb cut greater than 10 feet but in no case greater than 20 feet in width may be substituted for each two curb cuts permitted by subsection 23.54.030.F.1.a; and

 2) A greater width may be specifically permitted by the development standards in a zone; and

 3) ~~When~~If subsection D of Section 23.54.030 requires a driveway greater than 10 feet in width, the curb cut may be as wide as the required width of the driveway.

~~(~~4) For fire and police stations, the Director may allow curb cuts up to, and no wider than, the minimum width necessary to provide access for official emergency vehicles that have limited maneuverability and that must rapidly respond to emergencies. Curb cuts for fire and police stations are considered curb cuts for two-way traffic.
