 WHEREAS, the 2010-2015 Adopted Capital Improvement Program includes an unsecured funding gap of $3,993,000 for the Belltown/Queen Anne Waterfront Connections-Thomas Street Project; and

 WHEREAS, the City's 2010 Adopted Budget includes an appropriation for the Seattle Department of Transportation (SDOT) Belltown/Queen Anne Waterfront Connections-Thomas Street Project with a proviso restricting spending until authorized by a future ordinance; and

 WHEREAS, the 2010 budget proviso restricting spending on the Belltown/Queen Anne Waterfront Connections-Thomas Street Project anticipated that Council would not authorize further spending until SDOT and the Department of Parks and Recreation provide Council with a specific proposal for completing this project by modifying the scope or filling the funding gap; and

 WHEREAS, on August 4, 2010, the King County Project Evaluation Committee recommended additional funding for the Belltown/Queen Anne Waterfront Connections-Thomas Street Project in the amount of $3,960,000; and

 WHEREAS, the remaining funding gap of $33,000 for the Belltown/Queen Anne Waterfront Connections-Thomas Street Project is well within the budgeted contingency for the project total budget of $10,001,000; and

 WHEREAS, the City anticipates that the Belltown/Queen Anne Waterfront Connections-Thomas Street Project will be fully funded once the Puget Sound Regional Council takes final action on September 21, 2010; and

 WHEREAS, it is in the City's best interests to complete design and begin construction of the Belltown/Queen Anne Waterfront Connections-Thomas Street Project as soon as possible to create construction jobs, minimize construction costs, and complete this vital link for bicycles and pedestrians between the Uptown and Belltown neighborhoods and the waterfront trail in Myrtle Edwards Park; NOW, THEREFORE,
