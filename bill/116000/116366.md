 * If the Seattle Department of Transportation crews have to T-cut a utility cut, a $241.00 charge will be added to the total cost of the repair.

Reference Street and Sidewalk Pavement Opening and Restoration Rules (Director's Rule SDOT 2004-02) section 7.4.2.

 * A $325.00 surcharge will be billed to the permittee/contractor if there is a failure of the temporary utility cut patches due to base settlement before the cuts are permanently repaired. Reference Street and Sidewalk Pavement Opening and Restoration Rules (Director's Rule SDOT 2004-02) section 4.3.1.

 * If the asphalt depth is greater than 3 inches, the rate charge per cut will be the over 3" to 6", or greater than 6" asphalt depth rates.

 Billing Rates for Non-Standard Repairs for Utility Cuts

 Explanatory Notes:

 * Non-Standard Repairs are larger than 18 square feet and are billed at a cost per square foot basis. The application of the pavement opening drives how the charges are assessed because what is replaced is predicated on the pavement condition at the time of the utility cut.

 * If native material is determined by the SDOT to be acceptable for backfill, a credit of $25.00 per ton will be given.

 * Standby time will be charged to the nearest 0.1 hour for any time SDOT crews are kept waiting after being called out to make a repair.

 * Overtime rates will be charged for that portion of any repair that is accomplished after 3:00 PM on a regular working day, or for any repair that is done on a Saturday, Sunday, or City holiday.

 * All repairs that do not conform to the usual methods of operation, or require unusual materials, for example, colored concrete, bricks, cobblestones, etc., plus all repairs outside City of Seattle limits, will be charged time and materials.

 * When SDOT crews have to T-cut a utility cut, $20.00 per Sq Ft will be added for work performed during regular business hours and $27.00 per Sq Ft will be added for work performed after 3:00 PM on regular business days or on Saturday, Sunday or any City Holiday. Reference Street and Sidewalk Pavement Opening and Restoration Rules (Director's Rule SDOT 2004-02) section 7.4.2.

 * If the asphalt depth is greater than 3 inches, the rate charge per square foot will be the over 3" to 6", or greater than 6" asphalt depth rates.

 * A $115.00 additional charge will be added when extra traffic control signing is required on principal and minor arterials and in the Central Business District. Reference the City of Seattle Traffic Control Manual for In-Street Work, August 1, 1994.

 * A $325.00 surcharge will be billed to the permittee/contractor if there is a failure of the temporary utility cut patches due to base settlement before the cuts are permanently repaired. Reference Street and Sidewalk Pavement Opening and Restoration Rules (Director's Rule SDOT 2004-02) section 4.3.1.

 * All sewer tunnel backfilling work will be done on time and material work orders.

 * A $58.00/per hour charge will be added when a Uniformed Police Officer or a dedicated SDOT Flagger is necessary for traffic control.
