 November 18, 2008 Version # 1 ATTACHMENT 1: Memorandum of Understanding By and Between City of Seattle and the Seattle Department of Transportation and International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers Local 77

 Effective January 23, 2009 through January 22, 2013

 This MEMORANDUM OF UNDERSTANDING is supplemental to the AGREEMENT by and between the City of Seattle, hereinafter referred to as the City, and the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers Local 77, hereinafter referred to as the Union. Collectively they shall be known as the Parties.

 It is understood and agreed by and between the City and the Union that:

 1. All the terms and conditions of the Labor Agreement, currently in effect from January 23, 2006 through January 22, 2009 shall be rolled over to provide for a new contract period from January 23, 2009 through January 22, 2013 except for the following changes:

 a) Effective January 23, 2009, base wage rates for titles covered under this collective bargaining agreement shall receive an adjustment (COLA) equal to six point two percent (6.2%).

 b) Effective January 23, 2010, base wage rates for titles covered under this collective bargaining agreement shall receive a cost of living adjustment equal to one hundred percent (100%) of the percentage increase in the Seattle-Tacoma-Bremerton area Consumer price Index for the June-over-June method consistent with "Article 23 Wage Rates", in the current agreement.

 c) Effective January 23, 2011, base wage rates for titles covered under this collective bargaining agreement shall receive a cost of living adjustment equal to one hundred percent (100%) of the percentage increase in the Seattle-Tacoma-Bremerton area Consumer price Index for the June-over-June method consistent with "Article 23 Wage Rates", in the current agreement.

 d) Effective January 23, 2012, base wage rates for titles covered under this collective bargaining agreement shall receive a cost of living adjustment equal to one hundred percent (100%) of the percentage increase in the Seattle-Tacoma-Bremerton area Consumer price Index for the June-over-June method consistent with "Article 23 Wage Rates", in the current agreement.

 e) The parties agree that the Seattle Municipal Code regarding the funding of the Seattle City Employees' Retirement System (hereinafter, "System") shall be amended consistent with the following language:

 If a year-end actuarial study commissioned by the System finds that the amortization period for the System's unfunded actuarial liability exceeds thirty (30) years and the City determines that an increase in contribution rates to the System is necessary, the City and employees shall equally increase contribution rates. Such increases shall not result in employees paying greater than a 10.03% contribution rate.

 The required contribution rate increases shall take effect no sooner than the beginning of the first pay period of the year following completion of the actuarial study. For example, if the actuarial study for the System as of December 31, 2008 was presented to the Retirement Board in June 2009, and if that study showed an amortization period for the unfunded liability in excess of thirty (30) years that the City determined required a total increase in contributions of one percent (1%) to meet the System's unfunded liability threshold, the City's contribution rate would increase by one-half of one percent (.5%) and the employee contribution rate would increase by one-half of one percent (.5%) as soon as the beginning of the first pay period of 2010.

 2. The terms of all amending memoranda of understanding, memoranda of agreement and letters of agreement if identified in the current Labor Agreement which would have expired as of January 22, 2009, and any subsequent memoranda or letters signed between the parties since the last round of bargaining that may not be identified in the agreement, shall also be rolled over for the period January 23, 2009 through January 22, 2013.

 3. The City and the Union agree that the HMA medical option of coverage shall be phased out by January 1, 2009, and the employees will be allowed to transition to the Aetna or Group Health Cooperative options.

 4. To replace this plan, the City will offer an alternate City of Seattle Traditional Plan that is the same plan design as the plan currently offered, but administered by Aetna using the Aetna network of health care providers. To mitigate the potential disruption from this change in networks, the City will pay all physician charges (both preferred and non-preferred) at the preferred rate for a period of six (6) months, through June 30, 2009 while employees or family members review the Aetna preferred provider network. If an employee or family member is involved in an active course of treatment that goes beyond this 6-month time period the employee or family member may be permitted to continue with that treatment program at the preferred payment level until that treatment is completed, provided they submit the appropriate Transition Of Care request to Aetna and receive approval. (Some examples of an active course of treatment include pregnancy, chemotherapy, terminal illness, sequential surgeries, recent surgery, outpatient treatment for mental health or substance abuse, and organ or bone marrow transplants.) To mitigate the potential disruption from differences between the Caremark and the Aetna prescription drug formularies, the City will cover drugs that are on the Caremark preferred brand formulary as of January 1, 2009 at the preferred co-payment rate for a period of six (6) months while employees and family members research their prescription options with their physician or pharmacist. In return, the City will make certain enhancements to the existing plan options at no additional cost to the members of IBEW, Local 77 for such enhancements. These enhancements are identified in attachment "1" that is made a part hereof. Implementation of the enhancements will take place January 1, 2009.

 5. Transit Subsidy: Effective upon signature, the City agrees to increase the transit pass subsidy to an amount equal to the current monthly rate of a "one-zone" peak Puget Pass.

 * Services and supplies that may not be covered by the health care plan but are still considered an eligible expense by the IRS, such as hearing aid batteries, acupuncture, home improvements for medical reasons (e.g., wheelchair ramps, lowering of kitchen countertops), contact lens solution and laser vision correction.

 Expenses not eligible for reimbursement include health insurance premiums (already deducted on a pre-tax basis from your paycheck), vitamins, health club dues, and cosmetic surgery or treatments.
