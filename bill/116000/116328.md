 WHEREAS, capital requirements and operating costs of the Water Fund have increased in recent years in response to security, environmental and infrastructure concerns, with a resulting increase in the revenue requirements of the Water Fund; and

 WHEREAS, Ordinance 121761, passed March 28, 2005, established a minimum balance for the Water Fund Revenue Stabilization Subfund of $9,000,000, and permits funds in excess of this amount to be used to meet operating expenses, pay Capital Improvement Program expenditures, or to comply with financial policies; and

 WHEREAS, the current balance in the Revenue Stabilization Subfund exceeds the minimum balance, and the City desires that excess funds be withdrawn to reduce the Water Fund revenue requirement and thereby reduce otherwise necessary increases in water rates; and
