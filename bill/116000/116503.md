 AN ORDINANCE relating to the 2009 Budget; recognizing the carry forward of certain unexpended capital appropriations from the 2008 budget; appropriating unexpended funds for non-capital purposes from the 2008 budget of various departments; and imposing budget provisos; all by a three-fourths vote of the City Council.

 WHEREAS, RCW 35.32A.080 provides that unexpended and unencumbered appropriations for capital purposes automatically carry forward from each budget year to the next unless abandoned by ordinance; and

 WHEREAS, appropriations for the City's Capital Improvement Program (CIP) are readily identifiable as being capital in nature and therefore automatically carry forward without Council action; and

 WHEREAS, the City appropriates funds for capital purposes that are not readily identifiable as capital appropriations because they are not tied to a CIP project; and

 WHEREAS, it was, and is, the Executive's and City Council's intent that those capital appropriations are carried forward in accordance with RCW 35.32A.080; and

 WHEREAS, certain City departments and agencies have unexpended 2008 non-capital appropriations that the Executive and City Council wish to appropriate for 2009, but which were not included in the 2009 Adopted Budget; NOW, THEREFORE,

The Chair shall file the certification with the City Clerk. Those appropriations are automatically carried forward to the 2009 budget for the same capital purposes for which they were intended, in accordance with RCW 35.32A.080.

 and further provided, however, that none of the money appropriated in Item 2.4 above for Finance General Support to Community Development BCL may be spent for the University Heights Center for the Community Association until authorized by a future ordinance. The Council anticipates that such authority will not be granted until the City enters into a contract with the University Heights Center for the Community Association.

 The above budget provisos are effective as restrictions on the purposes for which the appropriations in Items 2.2 and 2.4 are made. Use of any amount of the restricted portions of these appropriations for any other purposes than those stated, or for any purpose expressly excluded, whether by transfer pursuant to SMC Chapter 5.08 or by any other means, is prohibited.

 Section 3. In accordance with RCW 35.32A.060, by reason of the facts above stated, some of the foregoing appropriations are made to meet actual necessary expenditures of the City for which insufficient appropriations have been made due to causes which could not reasonably have been foreseen at the time of the making of the 2009 Budget.
