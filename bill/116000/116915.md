Subsequent increases or other modifications to the salary of an employee who is being paid in an alternate pay zone shall be in accordance with the Program Plan document.

 D. Plan Document: The Personnel Director is authorized to develop and publish guidelines and a plan document to support administration of this Electric Utility Executive Compensation Program.

 E. Program Maintenance/No Cost of Living Adjustments: The Personnel Director shall review the pay zones at least every two years and recommend to the City Council any pay zone adjustments the Director deems appropriate. The titles and position incumbents assigned to titles in the Electric Utility Executive Compensation Program are not eligible for cost of living adjustments that may be granted to other non- represented positions and employees.

 F. Relocation Expenses: Should the reimbursement of relocation costs be necessary to successfully recruit an individual for a position within the Electric Utility Executive Compensation Program, the City Light Department is authorized to pay, from funds accumulating in the budget of the City Light Department, reasonable and documented costs associated therewith in amount equal to two times that authorized from time to time pursuant to ((~~S.M.C.~~)) subsection 4.14.150 . A.

C.

 G. Incentive Program: For employees in the Electric Utility Executive Compensation Program, a lump sum payment, in addition to base salary, may be awarded on an annual basis for recognition of the accomplishment of goals and work outcomes at the completion of the annual evaluation period.

 4.36.125 Determination of creditable service.

 A. A member in an eligible full-time position, with creditable service for every day, will accrue a creditable year of service for ((~~twelve (~~))12((~~)~~)) months' service. No additional credit is given for Leap Year's Day.

 B. For a member in a temporary, intermittent or part-time position, eight ((~~(8)~~))hours constitutes one ((~~(1)~~))day; and a creditable year of service is measured as ((~~two hundred sixty-one (~~))261((~~)~~)) credited days or ((~~two thousand eighty-eight (~~))2,088((~~)~~)) hours of compensated service at straight- time pay.

 C. When shown on the City's payroll, paid vacation, sick leave, military leave, funeral leave, and, if the employee pays his or her contribution, "time loss" on worker's compensation or time during family and medical leave under Chapter 4.26, are counted. Overtime (whether or not paid), unpaid leave, time not worked during a layoff, strike or disciplinary suspension, and service as a volunteer are not counted.

 D.

When payroll records are available, the Director of ((~~Executive Administration~~))  Finance and Administrative Services  shall multiply the hours worked by a temporary, interim, seasonal, or provisional worker and a worker in a part-time position of less than ((~~twenty (~~))20((~~)~~)) hours per week over a one ((~~(1)~~))year period by a factor of ((~~one and one hundred thirty-five thousandths (~~))1.135((~~)~~)) in reporting creditable service to the retirement system, to account for paid leave which was not received and for premium pay which may be substituted for paid leave. Director of ((~~Executive Administration~~))  Finance and Administrative Services  shall reduce the hours or days determined by application of the multiplier by the amount of any paid leave actually provided to the employee and counted in the hours or days worked.

 E. No creditable service may accrue for City employment during which the City contributes to another retirement system on the employee's behalf or for a member's City employment after he or she retires on a service retirement and, except for the annual death benefit assessment, no deduction shall be made from his or her pay for retirement purposes.

 A. The Board shall keep in convenient form such data as shall be necessary for the actuarial valuation of the retirement fund created by this chapter. At the end of the three ((~~(3)~~))year period beginning with the year 1974, and at the end of every three ((~~(3)~~))year period thereafter, the Board shall cause to be made an actuarial investigation into the mortality, service and compensation experience of the members and beneficiaries as defined by this chapter; and shall further cause to be made an actuarial valuation of the assets and liabilities of the retirement fund, and upon the basis of such investigation and valuation and subject to the approval of the City Council, shall:

 F. Whenever the Board deems it necessary or advisable, it may recommend that the City Council change the rates of contributions of members on the basis of mortality, service, and other tables adopted by the Board pursuant to subsection A of this section.

 G. The Board may adopt rules deemed appropriate to carry out this chapter, and may delegate to the Executive Director the adoption of policies, procedures, and/or guidelines, which are consistent with its rules and with the ordinance codified herein.

 Section 99. Section 4.36.195 of the Seattle Municipal Code, last amended by Ordinance 121365, is amended as follows:

 4.36.195 Buy-in of creditable service by temporary, interim, intermittent, provisional and part-time workers.

 These terms and conditions apply to workers acquiring ("buying in") creditable service under Section 4.36.103 for earlier work in temporary, interim, intermittent and provisional positions or part-time positions of less than ((~~twenty (~~))20((~~)~~)) hours per week during the course of the year.

 A. Eligible Services. Only hours in continuous City service as shown on City payrolls can be counted subject to the multiplier in Section 4.36.125. A break in the continuity of City service excludes hours before the break. Such a break in on-call, seasonal or intermittent service occurs if a worker:

 1. Removes his or her name from a roster or listing for work assignments;

 2. In seasonal employment, declines the opportunity to work for a season; or, in other employment, fails to work at least ((~~one hundred (~~))100((~~)~~)) hours in any ((~~twelve (~~))12((~~)~~)) month period;

 3. Takes other actions indicating that he or she has stopped or suspended for a year providing his or her services to the City; or

 4. Is discharged from City employment.

 B. Amount of Creditable Service. Creditable service shall be granted only for the hours for which both the worker and the City make contributions to the retirement system at the rate contemplated by Section 4.36.110. To receive creditable service for prior City service, such a worker shall deposit into the retirement system an amount determined by the Board of Administration equal to the sum, or some part thereof, that he or she would have paid had he or she become a member when first eligible and had deductions been made from his or her pay warrants, through the years, for creditable service, together with interest thereon. Interest shall accrue at the Board's assumption rate established for actuarial purposes from the date of the wage or salary payment to the date of deposit and shall be compounded annually.

 C. Waiting Period, Service Before 1988. A worker, who began his or her continuous City service on or before December 31, 1987 and has not already received such credit, shall receive creditable service for the first ((~~one thousand forty-four (~~))1,044((~~)~~)) hours, or portion thereof, of continuous service that he or she worked before January 1, 1988. This is a transitional exception to subsection B of Section 4.36.103.

 D. Administration. The Board, in its discretion, may delegate to the Executive Director the calculation of the amount of contribution for such a worker to acquire ("buy in") in prior creditable service and may authorize its Executive Director to use an approximate formula to simplify computations and/or to determine credit for vacation and other paid leave when City records are not available therefor. For example, for hourly workers, who have held the same or similar positions over the duration of the buy-back period, the Board may determine the amount due by:

 1. Classifying the worker's creditable hours by the contribution rate in effect at the time the hours were worked;

 2. Multiplying the creditable hours in each rate classification by the worker's current hourly wage rate and by the applicable contribution rate; and

 3. Adding the total of the products of all such classifications together.

 E. Maintenance of Membership. Such a worker who joins the retirement system shall maintain his or her membership in the retirement system for the duration of his or her City service until retirement. A member of the retirement system, who has not retired from the City and who accepts temporary, intermittent, or part-time work, shall continue to make his or her contributions to the retirement system.

 F. Deposit Contract. The Board may authorize such a worker to make his or her deposit under an agreement for installment payments under the following terms and conditions:

 1. The deposit must be completed within ten ((~~(10)~~))years from the date of the member's eligibility to join the retirement system.

 2. After deducting any immediate deposits, the balance shall be payable in approximately equal amortized installments unless the Board authorizes otherwise. Installments shall be deducted from the worker's pay whenever practical. By rule the Board may establish a minimum initial deposit and allowable installment payment and may include other appropriate terms and conditions in the agreement.

 3. A member may accelerate and prepay all or part of his or her deposits at any time before he or she dies, retires, or discontinues City service, whichever may be sooner. In the event of extenuating circumstances that preclude an earlier payment, the Executive Director may allow a member up to ten ((~~(10)~~))days after his or her retirement or discontinuance of City service to make a lump sum payment of the balance.

 4. If a member dies, retires, or discontinues city service before completion of the contract, the member shall receive creditable service on his or her buy-in on a pro rata basis.

 5. The member is responsible for making any adjustments appropriate under the Internal Revenue Code with respect to individual retirement accounts and privately administered retirement plans.

 G. City Matching Money. The City shall match the member's contributions and deposits, including interest, in the same manner as other members. If the worker provided services in two ((~~(2)~~)) or more departments,  at the request of  the ((~~City Finance~~)) Director  of Finance, the City Budget Director  shall apportion the amount of the City contribution among the employing departments. The ((City)) Director of Finance 's ((~~Director's)~~)  determination of  apportionment shall be final.

 H. Members who have otherwise failed to exercise an option to purchase creditable service for prior service previously rendered as a temporary worker, as that term is defined at Subsection 4.04.030 (3 5 ((~~3~~))), shall be allowed to purchase creditable service for service previously rendered but not credited as a temporary worker, by paying into the retirement fund, at the time of resignation from City service or at retirement, the actuarial present value of the resulting increase in his or her benefit. The terms and conditions of purchase shall be in accordance with the provisions of Subsection 4.36.190 B.3 ((~~(B)(3)~~)).

 B. As to insurance groups or companies providing such insurance on an individual basis or on a group basis for groups of less than ((~~twenty-five (~~))25((~~)~~)) individuals, such insurance group or company, for reimbursement to the City of its costs in connection with such deductions and payment, shall pay to the City upon quarterly billings by the Director of ((~~Executive Administration~~))  Finance and Administrative Services , ((~~Ten Cents (~~))$.10((~~)~~)) for each payroll deduction for each employee who has authorized as provided herein deduction and payment of disability insurance premiums to such insurance group or company.

 Section 234. Section 7.20.080 of the Seattle Municipal Code, last amended by Ordinance 121468, is amended as follows:

 7.20.080 Moorage fee increases -- Hearing.

 A. A moorage owner seeking a moorage fee increase shall give the floating home owners affected thereby a written notice, at least ((~~thirty (~~)) 30((~~)~~)) days before the increase will go into effect, stating the amount of the increase, financial computations demonstrating the need for the increase, and the effective date of the increase. If the proposed moorage fee increase is to be based, in whole or in part, on a cost basis established by a sale, lease or other transaction concerning the moorage property or facilities, then the notice shall include identification of the parties to the transaction, all material terms of the transaction and an explanation as to whether and how the transaction resulted in a genuine change in control of the property or facilities so as to justify the use of a new cost basis.

 B. If at least ((~~one-half (~~))1/2((~~)~~)) of the floating home moorage site lessees in a floating home moorage, excluding the moorage owner and those who have an ownership interest in the moorage, who are subject to a moorage fee increase in the same percentage amount (plus or minus ((~~one percentage point (~~)) one percent  ((~~%)~~)) believe that the demanded fee increase is unreasonable, they may collectively file a petition for review with the Hearing Examiner. The petition shall be in the form of a sworn statement which shall: (1) be signed by each petitioning moorage site lessee; (2) list separately the name and floating home address of each such moorage site lessee; and (3) include a statement of the intention of each moorage site lessee to contest the proposed moorage fee increase. In determining whether at least half of those affected have petitioned only one signature per moorage site will be counted. The petition shall be filed within ((~~fifteen (~~))15((~~)~~)) days of receipt of written notification of the moorage fee increase. The person or persons filing a petition for review shall pay a filing fee of ((~~Twenty five Dollars (~~)) $25((~~.00)~~)) per petitioner, with a maximum fee of ((~~Seventy- five Dollars (~~)) $75((~~.00)~~)), to the ((~~City~~)) Director of  Finance and Administrative Services ((~~Executive Administration~~)), which fee shall be refunded if no hearing is required. The Hearing Examiner may consolidate the petitions contesting moorage fee increases at the same moorage.

 C. The Hearing Examiner's review shall to the extent possible be based upon written memoranda, sworn statements, and affidavits submitted by the parties. The moorage owner shall, as soon after the filing of the petition as practicable, file with the Hearing Examiner and serve upon the petitioning floating home moorage site lessees or their representative, a memorandum and any necessary affidavits or sworn statements in support of the proposed increase. The floating home moorage site lessees shall submit a responsive memorandum and affidavits within ((~~fifteen (~~))15((~~)~~)) days of receipt of the moorage owners' submission. The Hearing Examiner shall review the memoranda, affidavits, and sworn statements and advise the parties in writing of: (1) the legal and factual issues to be resolved; (2) the time and place for the hearing; and (3) the length of time that each party will have to present his or her case. In connection with such review the Hearing Examiner may require any party to the proceedings to provide any information needed to determine whether the demanded moorage fee increase is reasonable. Either party's failure to provide information requested by the Hearing Examiner may, at the Hearing Examiner's discretion, result in a finding or findings against the party refusing to provide the information as regards facts that could be proved or disproved by the requested information.

 D. 1. The Hearing Examiner shall find whether that portion of the proposed moorage fee increase which is in excess of that permitted in Section 7.20.090, or an increase in a lesser amount, or no increase in excess of that permitted in Section 7.20.090, is necessary to assure a fair and reasonable return to the moorage owner and shall order such increase as is found necessary to assure a fair and reasonable return. In making the determination, the Hearing Examiner, in addition to any other factors deemed relevant, shall consider the following factors: (a) the purchase or lease price of the moorage and the terms of any transaction relied upon to establish the cost basis for the moorage; (b) increases or decreases since the last moorage fee increase in the expenses of operation and maintenance of the floating home moorage; provided, that such expenses are for services, repairs, property maintenance, or any other expenses which are reasonable and necessary for the continued operation of a floating home moorage; (c) the reasonable costs of capital improvements since the last moorage fee increase to the floating home moorage property which benefit the floating home owners occupying moorage sites at the floating home moorage; (d) increases or decreases since the last moorage fee increase in necessary or desirable services furnished by the floating home moorage owner or operator, where such increased or decreased services affect the person or persons initiating the fact-finding proceedings; (e) substantial deterioration since the last moorage fee increase in the facilities provided for the occupants of moorage sites at such floating home moorage due to failure of the moorage owner or operator to perform ordinary repairs, replacement and maintenance of the floating home moorage property and improvements; (f) comparability with moorage fees charges for other floating home moorage sites in the City; and (g) a reasonable return on leased land.

 2. Whenever the sale or lease price of a moorage or the terms of any transaction concerning the moorage are cited as a factor in demonstrating that a rent increase or any part thereof is necessary to assure a fair and reasonable return to the owner, the Examiner will allow sufficient time for discovery as appropriate under applicable Hearing Examiner Rules. The Hearing Examiner may rely on this factor as supporting a rent increase or any part thereof only if the moorage owner demonstrates at hearing that the sale or other transaction relied upon resulted in a genuine change in control of the moorage sufficient to justify a new cost basis for the moorage.

 E. No contested moorage fee increase shall take effect until approved by the Hearing Examiner's written decision; provided that the moorage owner or operator may recover retroactively from the date of the notice of the increase, with interest at the prevailing rate for United States Treasury bills on the date of the decision, such increases as are found reasonable by the Hearing Examiner. It shall be unlawful for a moorage owner or operator to demand, charge, or collect any moorage fee in excess of the amount approved by the Hearing Examiner for a period of one ((~~(1)~~))year from the effective date of any permitted fee increase, unless the moorage owner can show either that extraordinary damage to the moorage occurring after the decision has necessitated cost increases which make it impossible to realize a reasonable return without a fee increase, or that the floating home owner has rented the floating home to another at a profit; provided, that moorage owners may increase fees in the amount of any increases in state lease or City license fees whenever such increases are incurred, and may increase fees for the purpose of recovering the costs of capital improvements authorized by Section 7.20.090, whenever such improvements are required. Any fee increase necessitated by extraordinary damage shall be subject to Hearing Examiner review whenever such review is requested by at least ((~~one-half (~~ ))1/2((~~)~~)) of the floating home moorage site lessees affected, any other provision in this chapter to the contrary notwithstanding.

In lieu of posting the three most current utility bills for master metered or other unmetered utility services provided to the building as a whole that are included in the bill sent to the tenant, the landlord must make such utility bills available upon request within ((~~5~~)) five  business days and must inform tenants in the written notification required by subsection A.2 of the method by which they may request such utility bills.

 c. Landlords shall keep bills for master metered or other unmetered utility services on file in the building for at least two years and shall make such bills available to tenants for inspection and copying upon request. Where it is physically impracticable to keep such bills on file due to the absence of a suitable office or other storage space, a landlord may store the bills in another location and must make such bills available within 5 business days of receiving a request from a tenant.

 4. Limitations on Charges. The total of all charges for any utility service included in the bills sent to all units cumulatively shall not exceed the amount of the bill sent by the utility itself for the building as a whole, less any late charges, interest or other penalties owed by the landlord, with the exception of the following, which may be included in each bill covering an independent unit within the multi- unit building:

A third party billing agent who prior to the effective date of this ordinance has obtained a tenant's personally identifiable information shall take such actions as are necessary to protect such personally identifiable information and to prevent its use or disclosure except as expressly permitted in this chapter.

 b. A third party billing agent who prior to the effective date of this ordinance has obtained a tenant's personally identifiable information may disclose such personally identifiable information only to the extent necessary to render its billing services.

 c. To the extent required by federal, state, or local law, a billing entity may disclose personally identifiable information in its possession (i) pursuant to a subpoena or valid court order authorizing such disclosure, or (ii) to a governmental entity.

 8. Estimated Billing. If Seattle Public Utilities or Seattle City Light has billed the landlord using an estimate of utility service consumed, the billing agent may estimate the charges to be billed to tenants until billing based on actual consumption resumes. Upon receipt of a corrected bill showing that the estimated bill overstated charges, the landlord must refund the difference to tenants. Upon receipt of a corrected bill showing that the estimated bill understated charges, the landlord may attempt to recover the underpayment from the tenants that actually incurred the charges during the billing period, but shall not attempt to recover an underpayment from a tenant who did not reside in the unit during the billing period in which the charges were incurred.

 9. Submetering. Submetering is permitted as a way of allocating master metered utility services to tenants provided the following conditions are met:

 b. A landlord may not enter a unit without, and a tenant may not unreasonably withhold, consent to enter the unit in order to perform submeter installation, reading, repair, maintenance, and inspection, including removal of the submeter for testing, provided, however, that a landlord may enter a unit without a tenant's consent in the case of a submeter leak or emergency related to that unit's submeter.

 (ii) If a tenant contests the accuracy of the submeter, the tenant shall have the option of demanding that the City of Seattle provide an independent test of the meter through the Department of  Finance and Administrative Services ((~~Executive Administration~~)). If the meter reads within these ranges of accuracy, the tenant requesting the test shall pay the meter test fee. If the meter reads outside these ranges of accuracy, the landlord shall pay the meter test fee and within ((~~thirty (~~))30((~~)~~)) days refund any overpayments for the past three ((~~(3)~~))months based on a recalculation of the past year's billings by correcting for the inaccuracy of the submeter. Submetering thereafter shall only be permitted with a repaired submeter.

 (iii) The meter test fee for each test of a submeter pursuant to this subsection shall be ((~~Sixty-five Dollars (~~))$65((~~)~~)).

 B. Nothing in this section shall be construed to prevent a landlord from addressing billing of master metered or other unmetered utility services in a written addendum to a lease.
