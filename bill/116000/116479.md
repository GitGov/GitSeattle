 AN ORDINANCE related to land use and zoning; amending Section 23.49.012 of the Seattle Municipal Code to modify provisions for bonus development.

 BE IT ORDAINED BY THE CITY OF SEATTLE AS FOLLOWS:

 Section 1. Subsections A, B, and C of Section 23.49.012 of the Seattle Municipal Code, which section was last amended by Ordinance 122054, are amended as follows:

 23.49.012 Bonus floor area for voluntary agreements for housing and child care.

 A. General Provisions

 1. The purpose of this section is to encourage development in addition to that authorized by basic zoning regulations ("bonus development"), provided that certain adverse impacts from the bonus development are mitigated. Two ~~(2)~~ impacts from ~~such~~ additional development are an increased need for low-income housing ~~downtown~~to house the families of downtown workers having lower- paid jobs and an increased need for child care for downtown workers.

 2. If an applicant elects to seek approval of bonus development pursuant to this section, the applicant must execute a voluntary agreement with the City in which the applicant agrees to provide mitigation for ~~such~~the impacts identified in subsection 23.49.012.A.1. In the absence of a signed voluntary agreement, acceptance of a permit for any bonus development allowed under this section shall constitute a voluntary agreement on the terms set forth in this section. The mitigation may be provided by building the requisite low-income housing or child care facilities (the "performance option"),  or by making a contribution to be used by the City to build or provide the housing and child care facilities (the "payment option"), or by a combination of the performance and payment options.

 B. Voluntary Agreements for Housing and Child Care. ~~For each square foot of chargeable floor area above the base FAR to be earned under this section, t~~The voluntary agreement shall commit the developer to provide or contribute to the following facilities in the following amounts:

 1. Housing.

 a. ~~For each square foot of bonus floor area, h~~ Housing serving low-income households~~each of the specified income levels~~equal to at least 15.6 percent of each gross square foot of bonus floor area obtained through the performance option must be provided. ~~, or a~~A~~n alternative~~ cash contribution  for each gross square foot of bonus floor area obtained through the payment option, as an alternative to the performance option, for housing to serve low-income households ~~each specified income level,~~ must be provided~~according to Chart 23.49.012 A~~. The alternative cash contribution is $18.75 per gross square foot of bonus floor area obtained through the payment option, subject to adjustment under this section. The Director of Housing may adjust the alternative cash contribution, no more frequently than annually, approximately in proportion to the change in the Consumer Price Index, All Urban Consumers, Seattle-Tacoma-Bremerton metropolitan area, All Items (1982 - 84=100), as determined by the U.S. Department of Labor, Bureau of Labor Statistics, or successor index, or any other cost index that the Director of Housing may deem appropriate. The base year for the first adjustment shall be 2001. In the alternative, the Director of Housing may adjust the cash contribution amount based on changes to commercial and/or housing development costs estimated in a manner as the Director of Housing deems appropriate. Any adjustment to the cash contribution amount may be implemented through a rule-making process.

 b. For the performance option, housing serving low-income households must be provided within the project using the bonus development unless the Director, after consultation with the Director of Housing, approves an alternate location, as a Type I decision. The alternate location must be in one of the following areas, prioritized in the following order: 1) within the Downtown Urban Center; 2) within an Urban Center adjacent to the Downtown Urban Center; 3) in the City within 0.5 mile of a light rail or bus rapid transit station on a route serving the Downtown Urban Center; 4) in the City within 0.25 mile of a bus or streetcar stop on a route serving the Downtown Urban Center. In determining whether to approve an alternate location, the Director shall consider the extent to which low-income housing at that location would mitigate the impact of the development on the need for low-income housing serving downtown workers. For purposes of this subsection 23.49.012.B.1, a housing unit serves low-income households ~~up to an income level~~ only if ~~all of the following are satisfied~~ either:  1)

~~f~~For a period of ~~fifty (~~ 50~~)~~ years beginning upon the issuance of a final certificate of occupancy by the Department ~~of Planning and Development:~~(1)

 for the project using the bonus development, ~~T~~the housing unit is used as rental housing solely for low-income households~~with incomes, at the time of each household's initial occupancy, not exceeding that level; and~~,

~~(2)~~~~The monthly~~at rent  limited so that annual housing costs, including rent and basic utilities, do~~charged for the housing unit, together with a reasonable allowance for any basic utilities that are not included in the rent, does~~ not exceed ~~one-twelfth ( 1/12) of thirty (~~30~~)~~ percent of 80 percent of median~~that~~ income, and the housing unit and the structure in which it is located are maintained in decent and habitable condition, including adequate basic appliances in the housing unit~~level as adjusted for the estimated size of household corresponding to the size of unit, in such manner as the Director of the Office of Housing shall determine~~; or  2)

~~(3) There are no charges for occupancy other than rent~~The unit is sold for owner-occupancy to a low-income household at an initial sale price limited so that the annual housing costs, including mortgage principal and interest, real estate taxes, and insurance plus homeowner dues if applicable, are not expected to exceed 35 percent of 80 percent of median income, according to a calculation based on reasonable assumptions and approved by the Director of Housing, and the unit is subject to a recorded instrument satisfactory to the Director of Housing with a term of 50 years beginning upon the issuance of a final certificate of occupancy by the Department for the project using the bonus development, providing for sales prices on any resale consistent with affordability on the same basis as the initial sale, allowing resales only to low-income households, ~~;~~and requiring that upon any resale

~~(4) T~~the housing unit ~~and the structure in which it is located are maintained~~be in decent and habitable condition, including adequate basic appliances, for such ~~fifty (50)~~50 year period.

 c. For purposes of this section, housing may be considered to be provided by the applicant seeking bonus floor area if:

1)~~i~~It is committed to serve low- income households~~one (1) or more of the income groups referred to in this section~~ pursuant to an agreement between the housing owner and the City executed and recorded prior to the issuance of the building permit for ~~the construction of such~~the housing ~~or conversion of nonresidential space to such housing~~, but no earlier than three ~~(3)~~ years prior to the issuance of a master use permit for the project using the bonus floor area~~,~~; and ~~either:~~(1) The housing unit is newly constructed, is converted from nonresidential use, or is renovated space that was vacant as of the date of this ordinance, on the lot using the bonus floor area, pursuant to the same master use permit as the project using the bonus floor area; or

~~~~~~(~~2) The housing is newly constructed, is converted from nonresidential use, or is renovated ~~in a residential building that was vacant as of the date of this ordinance on a lot in a Downtown zone,~~; and:

 i. The housing is owned by the applicant seeking to use the bonus; or~~~~ii. The owner of the housing has signed, and there is in effect, a linkage agreement approved by the Director of ~~the Office of~~ Housing allowing the use of the housing bonus in return for necessary and adequate financial support to the development of the housing, and either the applicant has, by the terms of the linkage agreement, the exclusive privilege to use the housing to satisfy conditions for bonus floor area; or the applicant is the assignee of the privilege to use the housing to satisfy conditions for bonus floor area, pursuant to a full and exclusive assignment, approved by the Director of ~~the Office of~~ Housing, of the linkage agreement, and all provisions of this section respecting assignments are complied with. If housing is developed in advance of a linkage agreement, payments by the applicant used to retire or reduce interim financing may be considered necessary and adequate support for the development of the housing.

 d. Housing that is not yet constructed, or is not ready for occupancy, at the time of the issuance of a building permit for the project intending to use bonus floor area, may be considered to be provided by the applicant if, within three ~~(3)~~ years of the issuance of the first building permit for ~~such~~that project, the Department ~~of Planning and Development~~ issues a final certificate of occupancy for such housing. Any applicant seeking to qualify for bonus floor area based on ~~such~~ housing that is not ready for occupancy shall provide to the City, prior to the date when a contribution would be due for the cash option under subsection 23.49.012.C ~~of this section~~, an irrevocable bank letter of credit or other sufficient security approved by the Director of ~~the Office of~~ Housing, and a related voluntary agreement, so that at the end of the three ~~(3)~~ year period, if the housing does not qualify or is not provided in a sufficient amount to satisfy the terms of this section, the City shall receive (i) a cash contribution for housing in the amount determined pursuant to this section after credit for any qualifying housing then provided, plus (ii) an amount equal to interest on ~~such~~the contribution, at the rate equal to the prime rate quoted from time to time by Bank of America, or its successor, plus three ~~(3)~~ percent per annum, from the date of issuance of the first building permit for the project using the bonus. If and when the City becomes entitled to realize on any ~~such~~ security, the Director of ~~the Office of~~ Housing shall take appropriate steps to do so, and the amounts realized, net of any costs to the City, shall be used in the same manner as cash contributions for housing made under this section. In the case of any project proposing to use bonus floor area for which no building permit is required, references to the building permit in this subsection  23.49.012.B.1 shall mean the master use permit allowing establishment or expansion of the use for which bonus floor area is sought.

 e. Nothing in this chapter shall be construed to confer on any owner or developer of housing, any party to a linkage agreement, or any assignee, any development rights or property interests. Because the availability and terms of allowance of bonus floor area depend upon the regulations in effect at the relevant time for the project proposing to use ~~such~~the bonus floor area, pursuant to ~~SMC~~ Section 23.76.026, any approvals or agreements by the Director of ~~the Office of~~ Housing regarding the eligibility of actual or proposed housing as to satisfy conditions of a bonus, and any approval of a linkage agreement and/or assignment, do not grant any vested rights, nor guarantee that any bonus floor area will be permitted based on ~~such~~the housing.

 f. The Director of ~~the Office of~~ Housing shall review the design and proposed management plan for any housing proposed under the performance option to determine whether it will comply with the terms of this section.

 g. The Director of ~~the Office of~~ Housing is authorized to accept a voluntary agreement for the provision of housing and related agreements and instruments consistent with this section.

 h. Any provision of any Director's rule notwithstanding, it shall be a continuing permit condition, whether or not expressly stated, for each project obtaining bonus floor area based on the provision of rental housing under this subsection 23.49.012.B.1 , that the housing units shall continue to satisfy the applicable requirements of this subsection 23.49.012.B.1 throughout the required ~~fifty (~~50~~)~~ year period and that ~~such~~ compliance shall be documented annually to the satisfaction of the Director of ~~the Office of~~ Housing, and the owner of any project using ~~such~~the  bonus floor area shall be in violation of this title if any ~~such~~ housing unit does not satisfy ~~such~~applicable requirements, or if satisfactory documentation is not provided to the Director of the Office of Housing, at any time during ~~such~~that period. The Director of ~~the Office of~~ Housing may provide by rule for circumstances in which housing units maybe replaced if lost due to casualty or other causes, and for terms and conditions upon which a cash contribution may be made in lieu of continuing to provide housing units under the terms of this subsection 23.49.012.B.1. If housing is provided for owner occupancy pursuant to an agreement under subsection 23.49.012.B.1, the owner of any project using the bonus floor area shall be in violation of this title if the first sale or other transfer of a housing unit after it becomes subject to that agreement is not made to a low-income household or is not made on the terms and subject to the recorded instrument provided in subsection 23.49.012.B.1.b.2, which shall be a continuing violation until that unit or another unit accepted by the Director of Housing in substitution for it is sold to a low-income household on those terms, and subject to a recorded instrument as described in that subsection.

In the alternative, the Director of the Office of Housing may adjust the cash contribution amounts based, on changes to commercial and/or housing development costs estimated in such manner as the Director deems appropriate. Any such adjustment to the cash contribution amounts may be implemented through a rule-making process.

i~~j~~. Housing units provided to qualify for a bonus, or produced with voluntary contributions made under this section, should include a range of unit sizes, including units suitable for families with children. The ~~Housing~~ Director of Housing is authorized to prescribe by rule minimum requirements for the range of unit sizes, by numbers of bedrooms, in housing provided to qualify for a bonus. The ~~Housing~~ Director of Housing shall take into account, in any such rule, estimated distributions of household sizes among low-income households. The ~~Housing~~ Director of Housing is further authorized to adopt policies for distribution of unit sizes in housing developments funded by contributions received under this section.

 2. Child Care.

 a. For each square foot of bonus floor area allowed under this section, in addition to providing housing or an alternative cash contribution pursuant to subsection 23.49.012.B.1, the applicant shall provide fully improved child care facility space sufficient for 0.000127 of a child care slot, or a cash contribution to the City of ~~Three Dollars and Twenty-five Cents ($3.25)~~$3.25, to be administered by the Human Services Department. The Director of the Human Services Department may adjust the alternative cash contribution, no more frequently than annually, approximately in proportion to the change in the Consumer Price Index, All Urban Consumers, Seattle-Tacoma metropolitan area, All Items (1982-84=100), as determined by the U.S. Department of Labor, Bureau of Labor Statistics, or successor index, or any other cost index that such Director may deem appropriate. The base year for the first such adjustment shall be 2001. The minimum interior space in the child care facility for each child care slot shall comply with all applicable state and local regulations governing the operation of licensed childcare providers. Child care facility space shall be deemed provided only if the applicant causes the space to be newly constructed or newly placed in child care use after the submission of a permit application for the project intended to use the bonus floor area, except as provided in subsection 23.49.012.B.2.b~~(~~. 6~~)~~. If any contribution or subsidy in any form is made by any public entity to the acquisition, development, financing or improvement of any child care facility, then any portion of the space in such facility determined by the Director of the Human Services Department to be attributable to such contribution or subsidy shall not be considered as provided by any applicant other than that public entity.

 b. Child care space shall be provided on the same lot as the project using the bonus floor area or on another lot in a downtown zone and shall be contained in a child care facility satisfying the following standards:

~~(~~1) The child care facility and accessory exterior space must be approved for licensing by the State of Washington Department of Social and Health Services and any other applicable state or local governmental agencies responsible for the regulation of licensed child care providers.

~~(~~2) At least ~~twenty (20)~~20 percent of the number of child care slots for which space is provided as a condition of bonus floor area must be reserved for, and affordable to, families with annual incomes at or below the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development Low Income Standard for Section 8 Housing based on family size (or, if such standard shall no longer be published, a standard established by the Human Services Director based generally on ~~eighty (80)~~80  percent of the median family income of the Metropolitan Statistical Area, or division thereof, that includes Seattle, adjusted for family size). Child care slots shall be deemed to meet these conditions if they serve, and are limited to, ~~)~~a) children receiving child care subsidy from the City of Seattle, King County or State Department of Social and Health Services, and/or ~~(~~b) children whose families have annual incomes no higher than the above standard who are charged according to a sliding fee scale such that the fees paid by any family do not exceed the amount it would be charged, exclusive of subsidy, if the family were enrolled in the City of Seattle Child Care Subsidy Program.

~~(~~3) Child care space provided to satisfy bonus conditions shall be dedicated to child care use, consistent with the terms of this section, for ~~twenty (20)~~20 years. The dedication shall be established by a recorded covenant, running with the land, and enforceable by the City, signed by the owner of the lot where the child care facility is located and by the owner of the lot where the bonus floor area is used, if different from the lot of the child care facility. The child care facility shall be maintained in operation, with adequate staffing, at least ~~eleven (11)~~11 hours per day, five ~~(5)~~ days per week, ~~fifty (50)~~50 weeks per year.

~~(~~4) Exterior space for which a bonus is or has been allowed under any other section of this title or under former Title 24 shall not be eligible to satisfy the conditions of this section.

~~(~~5) Unless the applicant is the owner of the child care space and is a duly licensed and experienced child care provider approved by the Director of the Human Services Department, the applicant shall provide to the Director a signed agreement, acceptable to such Director, with a duly licensed child care provider, under which the child care provider agrees to operate the child care facility consistent with the terms of this section and of the recorded covenant, and to provide reports and documentation to the City to demonstrate such compliance.

~~(~~6) One ~~(1)~~ child care facility may fulfill the conditions for a bonus for more than one ~~(1)~~ project if it includes sufficient space, and provides sufficient slots affordable to limited income families, to satisfy the conditions for each such project without any space or child care slot being counted toward the conditions for more than one ~~(1)~~ project. If the child care facility is located on the same lot as one of the projects using the bonus, then the owner of that lot shall be responsible for maintaining compliance with all the requirements applicable to the child care facility; otherwise responsibility for such requirements shall be allocated by agreement in such manner as the Director of the Human Services Department may approve. If a child care facility developed to qualify for bonus floor area by one applicant includes space exceeding the amount necessary for the bonus floor area used by that applicant, then to the extent that the voluntary agreement accepted by the Director of the Human Services Department from that applicant so provides, such excess space may be deemed provided by the applicant for a later project pursuant to a new voluntary agreement signed by both such applicants and by any other owner of the child care facility, and a modification of the recorded covenant, each in form and substance acceptable to such Director.

 c. The Director of the Human Services Department shall review the design and proposed management plan for any child care facility proposed to qualify for bonus floor area to determine whether it will comply with the terms of this ~~s~~Section 23.49.012. The allowance of bonus floor area is conditioned upon approval of the design and proposed management plan by the Director. The child care facility shall be constructed consistent with the design approved by such Director and shall be operated for the minimum ~~twenty (20)~~20 year term consistent with the management plan approved by such Director, in each case with only such modifications as shall be approved by such Director. If the proposed management plan includes provisions for payment of rent or occupancy costs by the provider, the management plan must include a detailed operating budget, staffing ratios, and other information requested by the Director to assess whether the child care facility may be economically feasible and able to deliver quality services.

 d. The Director of the Human Services Department is authorized to accept a voluntary agreement for the provision of a child care facility to satisfy bonus conditions and related agreements and instruments consistent with this section 23.49.012. The voluntary agreement may provide, in case a child care facility is not maintained in continuous operation consistent with this subsection 23.49.012.B. 2 at any time within the minimum ~~twenty (20)~~20 year period, for the City's right to receive payment of a prorated amount of the alternative cash contribution that then would be applicable to a new project seeking bonus floor area. Such Director may require security or evidence of adequate financial responsibility, or both, as a condition to acceptance of an agreement under this subsection 23.49.012.B.2.

 C. Cash Option Payments. Cash payments under voluntary agreements for bonuses shall be made prior to issuance of any building permit after the first building permit for a project, and in any event before any permit for any construction activity other than excavation and shoring is issued, or if the bonus is for use of existing floor area, the cash payment shall be made prior to issuance of any permit or modification allowing for use of ~~such~~the space as chargeable floor area. ~~Such~~The payments shall be deposited in special accounts established solely to fund~~capital~~ expenditures for the~~public benefit features~~development of low-income housing and childcare ~~for which the payments are made as set forth in this section~~.  Earnings on balances in the special accounts shall accrue to those accounts. Cash payments made in lieu of providing low-income housing and any earnings thereon shall be deposited in the Low Income Housing Fund and used by the Director of Housing to support development of low-income housing, including renter or owner housing, which support may include financing property purchase for the purpose of providing low-income housing. Payments in lieu of low-income housing also may be used for loans or grants to low-income households for home purchases. The Human Services Director shall use cash payments made in lieu of child care facilities and any earnings thereon to support development of child care facilities. Uses of funds to support housing and child care facilities may include the City's costs to administer projects, not to exceed ten percent of total payments under this section and of any earnings thereon, and support provided through loans or grants to owners or developers. The location of low-income housing and child care facilities funded wholly or in part with cash payments shall be prioritized in the following order: 1) within the Downtown Urban Center; 2) within an Urban Center adjacent to the Downtown Urban Center; 3) in the City within 0.5 mile of a light rail or bus rapid transit station on a route serving the Downtown Urban Center; 4) in the City within 0.25 mile of a bus or streetcar stop on a route serving the Downtown Urban Center. Housing units that are funded with cash contributions under this section shall be generally comparable in their average size and quality of construction to other housing units in the same structure, in the judgment of the ~~Housing~~ Director of Housing.

 ***

 Section 2. Beginning July 1, 2010 and every two years thereafter the Director of Housing shall report to the Planning Land Use and Neighborhoods Committee or its successor committee on 1) to what extent new applicants utilizing the Downtown housing bonus under SMC 23.49.012, as amended by this ordinance, have chosen the performance option or the cash option; 2) where projects receiving funds from cash option payments are located; 3) how many units have been or will be created by cash option payments released through the Office of Housing Notice of Funding Availability process; 4) whether those units are new or existing in renovated buildings; 5) how many units have been or will be created by the performance option and where those units are located; 6) how many units are or will be owner-occupied and how many units are or will be rented; and 7) what levels of household income have been or will be served by units created by both the performance option and cash option.

 Section 3. The provisions of this ordinance are declared to be separate and severable. The invalidity of any particular provision, or its invalidity as applied in any circumstances, shall not affect the validity of any other provision or the application of the particular provision in other circumstances.

 Section 4. This ordinance shall take effect and be in force thirty (30) days from and after its approval by the Mayor, but if not approved and returned by the Mayor within ten (10) days after presentation, it shall take effect as provided by Municipal Code Section 1.04.020.
