 AN ORDINANCE relating to the partial release of a restrictive covenant and easement in gross restricting the use of property in the Rainier Valley; authorizing the Superintendent of the Department of Parks and Recreation to execute and record, in favor of the Housing Authority of the City of Seattle, a partial release of an encumbrance on real property; and superseding the requirements of Ordinance 118477 for purposes of this ordinance.

 WHEREAS, Ordinance 122772, approved in August 2008, authorized the Superintendent of Parks and Recreation to enter into an agreement with the Boys and Girls Clubs of King County (the "Boys and Girls Clubs") and its subsidiary, the Rainier Valley Boys and Girls Club (the "RVBGC"), for the purchase of a restrictive covenant and easement in gross (the "Covenant"); and

 WHEREAS, on or about October 2, 2008, under the terms of the agreement, the Superintendent accepted and recorded the Covenant, which restricts certain real property to use for a youth and teen recreational facility and requires public programming; and

 WHEREAS, the Boys and Girls Clubs and RVBGC constructed the Rainier Vista Boys and Girls Club facility ("Club"), and opened the Club in November 2008; and

 WHEREAS, the Club is providing programs, services, and recreational activities focused on nurturing youth through sports, education and recreation as required by the agreement and the Covenant; and

 WHEREAS, the Covenant encumbers the real property on which the Club was constructed; and

 WHEREAS, Council Bill 116591 proposes a re-plat of the property the Club is situated on; and

 WHEREAS, if Council Bill 116591 is passed by Seattle City Council and becomes effective, it will create a new legal lot adjacent to the Club; and

 WHEREAS, under the terms of a separate agreement, the RVBGC is required to convey the new legal lot to the Housing Authority of the City of Seattle ("SHA"), and SHA would like to build low income housing on the new legal lot adjacent to the Club; and

 WHEREAS, the existing Covenant would prevent or inhibit SHA's ability to obtain financing and construct low-income housing on the new lot adjacent to the Club; and

 WHEREAS, the City wishes to encourage the creation of low-income housing and the property being released will not adversely impact the City's benefits derived under the agreement and Covenant; NOW, THEREFORE,

 Tax Parcel ID# of Released Property: 605610-0710-09; 60510-0720-07; 605610-0740-03

 Legal Description (abb'd): Blks 27, 33, New Rainier Vista II Replat, recorded at __________________.

 Recording No. of

 Partially Released Doc: 20081008000327

 This Partial Release of Restrictive Covenant and Easement in Gross (the "Partial Release") is made this __ day of _________, 2009 by The City of Seattle, a Washington municipal corporation (the "City"), in favor of the Housing Authority of the City of Seattle ("SHA"), and partially releases that Restrictive Covenant and Easement in Gross dated October 2, 2008 and recorded under King County recording number 20081008000327 (the "Covenant and Easement").

 This Partial Release releases the Covenant and Easement from the following described real property (the "Released Property"):

 BLOCK 27 AND BLOCK 33 OF NEW RAINIER VISTA II RECORDED AT KING COUNTY RECORDER'S NUMBER ________________________, WHICH IS A PORTION OF THE SOUTHEAST QUARTER OF SECTION 16, TOWNSHIP 24 NORTH, RANGE 4 EAST, W.M., IN KING COUNTY, WASHINGTON.

 Recitals.

 This partial release is made with reference to the following facts:

 1. On or about October 2, 2008, the Rainier Valley Boys and Girls Club ("RVBGC"), a Washington non-profit organization, granted the City a Restrictive Covenant and Easement in Gross encumbering real property generally located at 4520 Martin Luther King Way S., Seattle, Washington.

 2. The purpose of the Covenant and Easement is to ensure the use of the property for the construction and operation of the Rainier Vista Boys and Girls Club (the "Club") and for public access and public benefits, all on certain terms and conditions.

 3. The Easement and Covenant was intended to encumber the real property on which the Club was constructed; however due to re-platting and the creation of a new legal lot adjacent to the Club, the Easement and Covenant is now encumbering property that is not required for the operation and maintenance of the Club in compliance with the terms in the Easement and Covenant.

 4. RVBGC conveyed the Released Property to the Seattle Housing Authority ("SHA") for housing purposes.

 5. The City does not require the encumbrance of the Released Property in order to receive the intended benefit of the Covenant and Easement, and additionally, the City wishes to ensure that the Released Property be used by SHA for housing purposes.

 Partial Release of Covenant and Easement.

 Based on the foregoing, the City hereby does release the Covenant and Easement from the Released Property described above. The Covenant and Easement shall continue to encumber all real property described in the Covenant and Easement, other than the Released Property. The property that continues to be encumbered by the Covenant and Easement is now legally described as follows:

 BLOCK 30 AND 31 OF NEW RAINIER VISTA II RECORDED AT KING COUNTY RECORDER'S NUMBER ________________________, WHICH IS A PORTION OF THE SOUTHEAST QUARTER OF SECTION 16, TOWNSHIP 24 NORTH, RANGE 4 EAST, W.M., IN KING COUNTY, WASHINGTON.

 Except as expressly and partially released hereby, the Covenant and Easement shall remain in full force and affect.
