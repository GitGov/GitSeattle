 AN ORDINANCE authorizing the levy of regular property taxes by the City of Seattle for collection in 2008, representing a decrease below the regular property taxes levied for collection in 2007.

 WHEREAS, to increase regular property taxes, RCW 84.55.120, as approved by the voters of the State of Washington in "Referendum 47" on November 4, 1997, requires the City to enact a separate ordinance indicating the change in taxes from the previous year in terms of percentage and total amount; and

 WHEREAS, the City of Seattle proposes to make its regular property tax levy for collection in 2008 in the amount reflected in the ordinance introduced as Council Bill 116077, which is a decrease from the amount of regular property taxes levied for collection in 2007; and

 WHEREAS, while the City therefore is not required by state law to enact this ordinance, the Executive wishes to reflect, on record, the change in regular property taxes from 2007 to 2008 in terms of dollars and percentage; and

 WHEREAS, pursuant to RCW 84.55.120, after proper notice was given, the City Council held a public hearing on October 10, 2007, to consider the City of Seattle's 2008 budget and the regular property tax levy to support it; and

 WHEREAS, notice of the City Council's consideration of this ordinance has been provided in the usual manner for other proposed City ordinances; NOW, THEREFORE,

These regular property tax levies for collection in 2007 and 2008 include regular property tax "levy lid lifts" previously approved by the voters of the City.

 Section 2. This ordinance shall take effect and be in force thirty (30) days from and after its approval by the Mayor, but if not approved and returned by the Mayor within ten (10) days after presentation, it shall take effect as provided by Municipal Code Section 1.04.020.
