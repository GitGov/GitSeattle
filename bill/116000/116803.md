 AN ORDINANCE relating to the City Light Department; establishing a Revenue Stabilization Account within the Light Fund, and adding a new Section 21.49.086 to the Seattle Municipal Code.

 WHEREAS, since 1977 the Mayor and City Council have set electric rates for the City Light Department (City Light) in compliance with specific financial policies adopted by resolution; and

 WHEREAS, the purpose of such financial policies is to maintain City Light's financial strength; and

 WHEREAS, wholesale market sales of surplus power are a major source of revenue for City Light, and due to the uncertain nature of its two primary drivers, hydroelectric generation and power market prices, this revenue is unpredictable, extremely variable, and largely uncontrollable; and

 WHEREAS, the size of this source of revenue has increased significantly since 2001 when, at the City's directions, City Light greatly increased the size of its power portfolio; and

 WHEREAS, Resolution 31181 adopted by the City Council on January 11, 2010 declared the Council's intent to complete a comprehensive review of City Light financial policies and to establish new policies by March 31, 2010, designed specifically to address the impact of the variability of wholesale revenue on the utility's financial performance; and

 WHEREAS, the City Council has completed its review of City Light financial policies; NOW THEREFORE,

 BE IT ORDAINED BY THE CITY OF SEATTLE AS FOLLOWS:

 Section 1. A new Section 21.49.086 is added to the Seattle Municipal Code as follows:

 SMC 21.49.086 Revenue Stabilization Account

 A. A Revenue Stabilization Account is established within the Light Fund. The purpose of this account is to absorb fluctuations in City Light's annual revenue in any given year due to deviations in net wholesale revenue from the amount assumed in the adopted budget for that year. Funds in this account cannot be used for any other purpose than that specified here.

 B. Target size of the Revenue Stabilization Account:

 The target size of the Revenue Stabilization Account shall be no less than $100 million and no greater than $125 million.

 C. Initial funding of the Revenue Stabilization Account:

 Initial funding of the Revenue Stabilization Account will come from a variety of sources including:

 (1) the amount remaining in City Light's existing Contingency Reserve Account;

 (2) cash from operations in 2010 in excess of that required for operations and debt service;

 (3) revenue from the sale of surplus property in 2010 and 2011 not already recognized in City Light's 2010 Adopted Budget; and

 (4) allowable savings in 2010, 2011, and 2012 from refunding bonds in 2010.

 D. Baseline for the Net Wholesale Revenue forecast:

 For the purpose of this Ordinance, Net Wholesale Revenue means gross wholesale revenue less the amount of wholesale purchases.

 The Net Wholesale Revenue forecast for any given year shall be the simple average of such revenue realized over all years beginning with 2002 and ending with the last year prior to that of the forecast for which City Light has complete information, unless, after consideration of additional information, the Council determines a different methodology is warranted. The forecast thus established shall be the amount of Net Wholesale Revenue assumed by the Council for the purpose of establishing City Light rates and budgets.

 The annual forecast will be distributed over the quarters of the year as follows:

 30% for January 1 to March 31;

 35% for April 1 to June 30;

 15% for July 1 to September 30; and

 20% for October 1 to December 31.

 The amounts determined in this way will be the quarterly Net Wholesale Revenue forecasts for the purpose of Subsection E and will be reported by City Light in its annual budget proposals.

 E. Use of the Revenue Stabilization Account:

 Effective January 1, 2011; should the actual Net Wholesale Revenue for any quarter be less than the forecast for that quarter as determined in Subsection D, City Light will transfer the difference, rounded to the nearest million dollars, from the Revenue Stabilization Account to the Light Fund. Alternatively, should the actual Net Wholesale Revenue for any quarter be greater than the forecast for that quarter as determined in Subsection D, City Light will transfer the difference, rounded to the nearest million dollars, from the Light Fund to the Revenue Stabilization Account. In each case the transaction will occur within thirty days of the end of the quarter in question.

 No later than thirty days after the end of each quarter, City Light will notify the Mayor and the Council of the forecast and actual Net Wholesale Revenue for that quarter and for the year to date, and of the amount remaining in the Revenue Stabilization Account after transfers authorized under this Subsection.

 F. Replenishment of the Revenue Stabilization Account:

 Effective January 1, 2011;

 (1) Whenever the amount in the Revenue Stabilization Account is $90 million or below, City Light will impose a surcharge equal to 1.5% of base rates at the earliest opportunity. The proceeds from the surcharge will be deposited into the Revenue Stabilization Account. The surcharge will remain in effect until the amount in the Revenue Stabilization Account reaches $100 million and will be removed at the earliest opportunity thereafter.

 (2) Whenever the amount in the Revenue Stabilization Account is $80 million or below, City Light will impose an additional surcharge equal to 1.5% of base rates at the earliest opportunity. The proceeds of the additional surcharge will be deposited into the Revenue Stabilization Account. The additional surcharge will remain in effect until the amount in the Revenue Stabilization Account reaches $90 million, and will be removed at the earliest opportunity thereafter.

 City Light will notify the Mayor and the Council in writing of its intent to impose a surcharge under either of these provisions.

 (3) If, in spite of the rate surcharges provided for in (1) and (2) of this Subsection, the amount in the Revenue Stabilization Account is $75 million or less, the Council will initiate a rate review within forty five days that will increase rates, reduce City Light spending, or identify additional sources of funding, or a combination of these measures, to bring the amount in the Account up to $100 million within a period of 12 or fewer months.

 Interest earned by the funds in the Revenue Stabilization Account will be deposited into that account.

 G. Disposition of excess funds in the Revenue Stabilization Account:

 Effective January 1, 2011; whenever the amount in the Rate Stabilization Account exceeds $125 million, the Council will initiate a rate review within forty five days that will decrease rates, allow City Light to cover more of its capital expenditures with cash from operations or defease outstanding debt in order to keep future rates low, or a combination of these measures, to bring the amount in the Account down to $125 million within a period of 12 or fewer months.

 Section 2. This ordinance shall take effect and be in force thirty (30) days from and after its approval by the Mayor, but if not approved and returned by the Mayor within ten (10) days after presentation, it shall take effect as provided by Municipal Code Section 1.04.020.
