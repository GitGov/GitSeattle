Section 2. Section 23.58A.013 of the Seattle Municipal Code, which Section was enacted by Ordinance 122882, is hereby reenacted and amended as follows:

 23.58A.013 Affordable housing incentive programs: purpose and findings

 A. Purpose; Scope of provisions; State Law Controlling. The provisions of this chapter related to housing bonus residential floor area are intended to implement affordable housing incentive programs authorized by RCW 36.70A.540, as it may be amended.~~The purpose of affordable housing incentive programs is to encourage higher density residential development in appropriate areas while ensuring that a portion of the additional development will be affordable housing, pursuant to authority granted in RCW 36.70A.540.~~ In case of any irreconcilable conflict between the terms of this ~~section~~chapter related to housing bonus residential floor area and the authority granted in RCW 36.70A.540, as it may be amended, the provisions of RCW 36.70A.540, as it may be amended, shall supersede and control. Unless the context otherwise clearly requires, references to RCW 36.70A.540 in this subchapter mean that section as in effect on the date as of which the provisions of this title apply to the application for a use permit for the project using the bonus floor area.

 B. Findings. Pursuant to the authority of RCW 36.70A.540, the City finds that the higher income levels specified in the definition of "income-eligible households" in Section 23.58A.004, rather than those stated in the definition of "low-income households" in RCW 36.70A.540, are needed to address local housing market conditions throughout the City.

 Section 3. Subsections B and C of Section 23.58A.014 of the Seattle Municipal Code, which Section was enacted by Ordinance 122882, are amended as follows:

 23.58A.014 Bonus residential floor area for affordable housing

 * * *

 B. Performance option.

 1. An applicant using the performance option shall provide low-income housing with a gross floor area at least equal to the greatest of (a) 17.5 percent of the net bonus residential floor area obtained through the performance option, except that an applicant may elect to provide low-income housing equal to 10 percent of the net bonus residential floor area obtained through the performance option if the housing is affordable to, and restricted to occupancy by, households with incomes no higher than 50% of median income as defined by Section 23.84A.025; or (b) 300 net residential square feet; or (c) any minimum floor area specified in the provisions of the zone. The percentage of net bonus residential floor area obtained through the performance option to be provided as low-income housing may be reduced by the Council below 17.5 percent of the net bonus residential floor area to no less than 15 percent of the net bonus residential floor area as a Type V decision on an official land use map amendment or text amendment when the Council determines that the reduction is needed to accomplish Comprehensive Plan goals and policies or to reflect economic conditions of the area. Applicants may provide low- income housing as part of the project using extra floor area, or by providing or contributing to a low-income housing project at another location, subject to requirements in subsection  23.58A.014.B.5 of this section and approval~~ed~~ in writing by the ~~Housing Director~~Director of Housing prior to issuance of the first building permit for the development using the bonus floor area.

 2. Affordable housing shall serve only income-eligible households for a minimum period of 50 years from the later of the date when the agreement between the housing owner and the City, as referenced in subsection 23.58A.014.B.5, is recorded, or the date when the affordable housing becomes available for occupancy as determined by the City. For rental housing, rent shall be limited so that housing costs, including rent and basic utilities, shall not exceed 30 percent of the ~~applicable income limit~~income limit for the unit under this section, all as determined by the ~~Housing Director~~Director of Housing, for a minimum period of 50 years. For owner-occupied housing, the initial sale price shall not exceed an amount determined by the ~~Housing Director~~Director of Housing to be consistent with affordable housing for an income-eligible household with the average family size expected to occupy the unit based on the number of bedrooms, and the units shall be subject to recorded instruments satisfactory to the ~~Housing Director~~Director of Housing providing for sales prices on any resale consistent with affordability on the same basis for at least 50 years.

 3. Affordable housing shall be provided in a range of sizes consistent with RCW 36.70A.540. The affordable housing shall comply with all requirements of RCW 36.70A.540.

 4. If the affordable housing is developed within the project using the bonus floor area:

~~(a)~~a. The affordable housing must serve income-eligible households for the minimum time period referred to in this section.

~~(b)~~b. The affordable housing shall be completed and ready for occupancy at or before the time when a certificate of occupancy is issued for any other units in the project using the bonus residential floor area, and as a condition to any right of the applicant to such a certificate of occupancy.

 5. If the affordable housing is not being developed within the project using the bonus residential floor area:

~~(a)~~a. Proposals for affordable housing at a location other than within the project using the bonus floor area are subject to approval by the ~~Housing Director~~Director of Housing . Approval requires a determination by the ~~Housing Director~~ Director of Housing that the affordable housing will (1) be located within the same neighborhood where the development using the bonus residential floor area is located, except as otherwise provided in subsection 23.58A.014.B.5.b~~B5(b) of this section~~; (2) provide a public benefit~~, the value of which, as demonstrated by the applicant, exceeds the amount of the payment-in-lieu that would otherwise be paid~~; and (3) be more affordable than market rents or sale prices, as applicable, for housing in the neighborhood in which the affordable housing is located.

~~(b)~~b. If the applicant demonstrates to the satisfaction of the ~~Housing Director~~Director of Housing that it is infeasible for the off-site affordable housing to be located within the same neighborhood where the development using the bonus residential floor area is located, then (1)~~(i)~~the~~Housing Director~~Director of Housing may allow the affordable housing to be provided elsewhere ~~in the City~~within the Seattle city limits, which is deemed within the general area of the development using the bonus residential floor area in accordance with RCW 36.70A.540, provided that the affordable housing is within 0.5 mile of a light rail or bus rapid transit station, or ~~(ii)~~(2) if the applicant demonstrates that providing the affordable housing in such a location is also infeasible, then the ~~Housing Director~~Director of Housing may allow the ~~off-site~~affordable housing to be provided within .25 mile of a bus or streetcar stop~~elsewhere within the same City sector, as delineated by Interstate-5, the Ship Canal and Interstate- 90 (as projected to Elliott Bay), where the development using the bonus residential floor area is located~~.

~~(c)~~c. The affordable housing must serve income-eligible households for the minimum time period referred to in this section pursuant to an agreement between the housing owner and the City.

~~(d)~~d. The agreement required by subsection 23.58A.014.B.5.c~~(c)~~ must be executed and recorded prior to issuance, and as a condition to issuance, of the first building permit for the project using the bonus residential floor area, and in any event before any permit for any construction activity other than excavation and shoring is issued.

~~(e)~~e. The applicant shall provide to the City an irrevocable letter of credit, or other sufficient security approved by the ~~Housing Director~~Director of Housing, prior to and as a condition of issuance of the first building permit, other than for grading and shoring, for the project using the bonus residential floor area, unless completion of the affordable housing has already been documented to the satisfaction of the ~~Housing Director~~Director of Housing and the affordable housing is subject to recorded restrictions satisfactory to the ~~Housing Director~~Director of Housing. The letter of credit or other security shall be in an amount equal to the Payment Option amount calculated according to provisions in subsection  23.58A.014.C ~~of this section~~, plus an amount equal to interest on such payment, at the rate equal to the prime rate quoted by Bank of America or its successor at the time the letter of credit or other security is provided, plus 3 percent per annum, from the date of issuance of the first building permit, other than for excavation and shoring, for the project using the bonus residential floor area. The letter of credit or other security shall be on terms such that when a certificate of occupancy is issued for the project using the bonus residential floor area, or on any earlier date 30 days before the letter of credit or other security will expire, if the required quantity of affordable housing is not completed and ready for occupancy or the affordable housing is not all subject to a recorded agreement sufficient to satisfy the terms of this section, the City shall have a right to draw on the letter of credit or other security. If and when the City becomes entitled to realize on any such security, the~~Housing Director~~Director of Housing shall take appropriate steps to collect the amount calculated pursuant to the ~~p~~Payment ~~o~~Option provisions in subsection  23.58A.014.C ~~of this section~~ (after allowing credit for any affordable housing then provided and accepted by the ~~Housing Director~~Director of Housing, with interest for the period and at the rate determined pursuant to this subsection, and the amounts realized, net of any costs to the City, shall be used in the same manner as cash payments for housing made under this section. To the extent the City receives payment through a letter of credit or other security, the obligation of the applicant to provide affordable housing will be deemed satisfied and the applicant shall be deemed to have elected the payment option. The applicant shall not be entitled to any refund based on later completion of affordable housing.

~~(f)~~f. If the ~~Housing Director~~ Director of Housing certifies to the Director that either ~~(i)~~ (1) the applicant has provided the City with a letter of credit or other sufficient security pursuant to subsection 23.58A.014.B.5.e~~B5(e) of this section~~; or ~~(ii)~~ (2)

 there have been recorded one or more agreements or instruments satisfactory to the ~~Housing Director~~Director of Housing providing for occupancy and affordability restrictions on affordable housing with the minimum floor area determined under this section, all affordable housing have been completed, and the affordable housing is on a different lot from the bonus residential floor area or are in one or more condominium units separate from the bonus residential floor area under condominium documents acceptable to the ~~Housing Director~~Director of Housing, then any failure of the affordable housing to satisfy the requirements of ~~this subsection B~~subsection 23.58A.014.B shall not affect the right to maintain or occupy the bonus residential floor area.

~~(g)~~g. Unless and until the ~~Housing Director~~Director of Housing shall certify as set forth in clause ~~(i)~~(1) or ~~(ii)~~(2) of subsection  23.58A.014.B.5.f~~B5(f) of this section~~, it shall be a continuing permit condition, whether or not expressly stated, for each project obtaining bonus residential floor area based on the provision of housing to which this section applies, that the affordable housing shall be maintained in compliance with the terms of this section and any applicable provisions of the zone, as documented to the satisfaction of the ~~Housing Director~~Director of Housing.

 6. No subsidies for bonused housing; Exception.

~~(a)~~a. The ~~Housing Director~~Director of Housing may require, as a condition of any bonus residential floor area under the performance option, that the owner of the lot upon which the affordable housing is located agree not to seek or accept any subsidies, including without limitation those items referred to subsection 23.58A.014.B.6.b.1~~B6(b)(i) of this section~~, related to housing, except for any subsidies that may be allowed by the ~~Housing Director~~Director of Housing under ~~that~~ subsection  23.58A.014.B.6.d. The Director may require that such agreement provide for the payment to the City, for deposit in an appropriate subfund or account, of the value of any subsidies received in excess of any amounts allowed by such agreement.

~~(b)~~b. In general, and except as may be otherwise required by applicable federal or state law, no bonus residential floor area may be earned by providing housing if:

~~(i)~~1) Any person is receiving or will receive with respect to the housing any charitable contributions or public subsidies for housing development or operation, including, but not limited to, tax exempt bond financing, tax credits, federal loans or grants, City of Seattle housing loans or grants, county housing funds, and State of Washington housing funds; or

~~(ii)~~2) The housing is or would be, independent of the requirements for the bonus residential floor area, subject to any restrictions on the income of occupants, rents or sale prices.

~~(c)~~c. For the purpose of this subsection  23.58A.014.B.6, the qualification for and use of property tax exemptions pursuant to Chapter 5.73 SMC, or any other program implemented pursuant to Chapter 84.14 RCW, does not constitute a subsidy, and any related conditions regarding incomes, rent or sale prices do not constitute restrictions.

~~(d)~~d. As an exception to the restriction on subsidies, the ~~Housing Director~~Director of Housing may allow the building or buildings in which the affordable housing is located to be financed in part with subsidies based on the determination that (1) the total amount of affordable housing is at least 300 net residential square feet greater than the amount otherwise required through the performance option under this section; (2) the public benefit of the affordable housing net of any subsidies, as measured through an economic analysis, exceeds the amount of the payment-in-lieu that would otherwise be paid; and (3) the subsidies being allowed would not be sufficient to leverage private funds for production of the affordable housing, under restrictions as required for the performance option, without additional City subsidy in an amount greater than the payment-in-lieu amount that would otherwise be paid.

 7. The ~~Housing Director~~Director of Housing is authorized to accept and execute agreements and instruments to implement this section. Issuance of the certificate of occupancy for the project using the bonus residential floor area may be conditioned on such agreements and instruments.

 8. The housing owner, in the case of rental housing, shall provide annual reports and pay an annual monitoring fee to the Office of Housing for each affordable housing unit, as specified under Chapter 22.900G. In the case of affordable housing for owner- occupancy, the applicant shall pay an initial monitoring fee to the Office of Housing as specified under Chapter 22.900G, and the recorded resale restrictions shall include a provision requiring payment to the City, on any sale or other transfer of a unit after the initial sale, of a fee in the amount of $500, to be adjusted in proportion to changes in the consumer price index from 2008 to the year in which the sale or transfer is made, for the review and processing of documents to determine compliance with income and affordability restrictions.

 C. Payment option. The payment option is available only where the maximum height for residential use under the provisions of the zone is more than 85 feet.

 1. Amount of payments. In lieu of all or part of the performance option, an applicant may pay to the City $18.94 per square foot of net bonus residential floor area.

 2. Timing of payments. Cash payments shall be made prior to issuance, and as a condition to issuance, of any building permit after the first building permit for a project, and in any event before any permit for any construction activity other than excavation and shoring is issued, unless the applicant elects in writing to defer payment. If the applicant elects to defer payment, then the issuance of any certificate of occupancy for the project shall be conditioned upon payment of the full amount of the cash payment determined under this section, plus an interest factor equal to that amount multiplied by the increase, if any, in the Consumer Price Index, All Urban Consumers, West Region, All Items, 1982- 84=100, as published monthly, from the last month prior to the date when payment would have been required if deferred payment had not been elected, to the last month for which data are available at the time of payment. If the index specified in this subsection is not available for any reason, the Director shall select a substitute cost of living index. In no case shall the interest factor be less than zero.

 3. Deposit and use of payments. Payments in lieu of affordable housing shall be deposited in a special account established solely to support the development of low-income housing as defined in this chapter. Earnings on balances in the special account shall accrue to that account. The ~~Housing Director~~Director of Housing shall use cash payments and any earnings thereon to support the development ~~or preservation~~ of low-income housing in any manner now or hereafter permitted by RCW 36.70A.540, including renter or owner housing for income- eligible households. Uses of funds may include ~~land purchase for the purpose of providing low-income housing;~~ the City's costs to administer projects, not to exceed 10 percent of the payments into the special account ~~loans or grants to public or private owners or developers of housing; and loans or grants to affordable households for home purchases. The location of a~~. Affordable housing funded wholly or in part with cash payments shall be located within eligible areas within the Seattle city limits, which is deemed the general area of the development using the bonus residential floor area in accordance with RCW 36.70A.540. Eligible areas shall be prioritized in the following order: (1) within the same neighborhoods where the developments using the bonus residential floor area are located; (2) ~~in the City~~ within 0.5 mile of light rail or bus rapid transit stations; and (3) within 0.25 mile of a bus or streetcar stop~~the same City sectors delineated by Interstate-5, the Ship Canal and Interstate-90 (as projected to Elliott Bay) where the developments using the bonus residential floor area are located~~.

 Section 4. A new Section 23.58A.016 is added to Subchapter II of Chapter 23.58A of the Seattle Municipal Code, as follows:

 23.58A.016 Bonus residential floor area for amenities

 A. Findings. The City Council finds that:

 1. Amenities, including public open space, are an important aspect of livability in areas targeted in the Comprehensive Plan for concentrated housing and employment growth. To address this need, the Comprehensive Plan establishes goals for the amount and distribution of open space. These goals are consistent with national standards developed to assist communities with planning to provide adequate open space serving specified population needs.

 2. Projects that add density will increase demand for public open space. If additional public open space is voluntarily provided to offset additional demand, the impacts on available open space resources will be mitigated.

 3. The average amount of public open space, including breathing room open space, needed to accommodate residential development is at least 0.14 square feet of open space per gross square foot of residential floor area in a project.

 B. Voluntary agreements for amenities. Where expressly permitted by the provisions of the zone, an applicant may achieve bonus residential floor area in part through a voluntary agreement for provision of amenities to mitigate impacts of the project, subject to the limits in this chapter.

 1. Amenities that may be provided for bonus residential floor area include:

 a. neighborhood open space, and

 b. green street setbacks on lots abutting designated green streets.

 2. The amenities listed in subsection 23.58A.016.B.1 are referred to as "open space amenities" in this Section 23.58A.016. Mitigation of impacts identified in subsection 23.58A.016.A above may be achieved by the performance option, by the payment option, or by a combination of the performance and payment options.

 C. Performance option.

 1. General. An applicant electing to use the performance option shall provide the amenity on the same lot as the development using the bonus floor area, except to the extent a combined lot development is expressly permitted by the provisions of the zone. The maximum area of any amenity or combination of amenities provided on a lot eligible for a bonus is established in this subsection 23.58A.016.C and may be further limited by Section 23.58A.012 or the provisions of the zone. Open space amenities must meet the standards of this subsection 23.58A.016.C in order to qualify for bonus residential floor area, except as may be authorized by the Director under ~~that~~ subsection 23.58A.016.C.4. An open space amenity may also qualify as a required residential amenity to the extent permitted by the provisions of the zone.

 2. Maximum open space amenity for bonus. Unless otherwise specified in the provisions of the zone, the amount of open space amenity for which bonus residential floor area may be allowed shall not exceed the lesser of the amount required to mitigate the impact created by the total bonus residential floor area in the project, or 15,000 square feet. For purposes of this Section 23.58A.016, the amount of open space required to mitigate that impact is 0.14 square feet of open space amenity per square foot of bonus residential floor area, unless the Director determines, as a Type I decision, that a different ratio applies based on consideration of one or both of the following:

 a. the overall number or density of people anticipated to use or occupy the structure(s) in which bonus residential floor area will be located, in relation to the total floor area of the structure(s), is different from the density level of approximately 1.32 persons per 1,000 gross square feet, which was used to establish the ratio in subsection 23.58A.016.C, such that a different amount of open space is needed to mitigate the project impacts;

 b. characteristics or features of the project mitigate the impacts that the anticipated population using or occupying the structure(s) in which bonus residential floor area will be located would otherwise have on open space needs.

 3. Bonus Ratio. Neighborhood amenities may be used to gain bonus residential floor area according to the following ratios and subject to the limits of this Section 23.58A.016:

 a. For a neighborhood open space, 7 square feet of bonus residential floor area per 1 square foot of qualifying neighborhood open space area (7:1).

 b. For a green street setback, 5 square feet of bonus residential floor area per 1 square foot of qualifying green street setback area (5:1).

 4. Standards for open space amenities. The following standards apply to all open space amenities identified in this subsection 23.58A.016.C.4 except as otherwise specifically stated in this subsection 23.58A.016.C.4 or in the provisions of the zone.

 a. Public Access. The open space must be open during daylight hours and accessible to the general public, without charge, for reasonable and predictable hours, for a minimum of 10 hours each day of the year, except that access may be limited temporarily as required for public safety and maintenance reasons. Within the open space, property owners, tenants and their agents shall allow members of the public to engage in activities allowed in the public sidewalk environment, except that those activities that would require a street use permit if conducted on the sidewalk may be excluded or restricted. Free speech activities such as hand billing, signature gathering, and holding signs, all without obstructing access to the space, any building, or other adjacent features, and without unreasonably interfering with the enjoyment of the space by others, shall be allowed. While engaged in allowed activities, members of the public may not be asked to leave for any reason other than conduct that unreasonably interferes with the enjoyment of the space by others unless the space is being closed to the general public consistent with this subsection 23.58A.016.C. No parking, storage or other use may be established on or above the surface of the open space except as provided in subsection 23.58A.016.C.4.b.6. Use by motor vehicles of open space for which bonus residential floor area is granted is not permitted. The open space shall be identified clearly with the City's public open space logo on a plaque placed at a visible location at each street entrance providing access to the feature. The plaque shall indicate, in letters legible to passersby, the nature of the bonus feature, its availability for general public access, and additional directional information as needed.

 b. Standards for Neighborhood Open Space. Neighborhood open space used to qualify for bonus floor area must satisfy the conditions in this subsection 23.58A.016.C.4.b, unless an exception is granted by the Director as a Type I decision, based on the Director's determination that, relative to the strict application of the standards, the exception will result in improved public access and use of the space or a better integration of the space with surrounding development:

 1) The open space must be improved in compliance with the applicable provisions of this Section 23.58A.016. The open space must consist of one continuous area with a minimum of 3,000 square feet and a minimum horizontal dimension of 10 feet.

 2) A minimum of 35 percent of the open space must be landscaped with grass, ground cover, bushes and/or trees.

 3) Either permanent or movable seating in an amount equivalent to 1 lineal foot for every 200 square feet of open space shall be available for public use during hours of public access.

 4) The open space shall be located and configured to maximize solar exposure to the space, allow easy access from streets or other abutting public spaces, including access for persons with disabilities, and allow convenient pedestrian circulation through all portions of the open space. The open space must have a minimum frontage of 30 feet at grade abutting a sidewalk, and be visible from sidewalks on at least one street.

 5) The open space shall be provided at ground level, except that in order to provide level open spaces on steep lots, some separation of multiple levels may be allowed, provided they are physically and visually connected.

 6) Up to 20 percent of the open space may be covered by features accessory to public use of the open space, including: permanent, freestanding structures, such as retail kiosks, pavilions, or pedestrian shelters; structural overhangs; overhead arcades or other forms of overhead weather protection; and any other features approved by the Director that contribute to pedestrian comfort and active use of the space. The following features within the open space area may count as open space and are not subject to the percentage coverage limit: temporary kiosks and pavilions, public art, permanent seating that is not reserved for any commercial use, exterior stairs and mechanical assists that provide access to public areas and are available for public use, and any similar features approved by the Director. Seating or tables, or both, may be provided and reserved for customers of restaurants or other uses abutting the open space, but the area reserved for customer seating shall not exceed 15 percent of the open space area or 500 square feet, whichever is less.

 c. Standards for green street setbacks.

 1) Where permitted by the provisions of the zone, bonus residential floor area may be gained for green street setbacks by development on lots abutting those street segments that are listed or shown as green streets in the provisions of the zone.

 2) A green street setback must be provided as a setback from a lot line abutting a designated green street. The setback must be continuous for the length of the frontage of the lot abutting the green street, and a minimum of 50 percent of the setback area eligible for a bonus shall be landscaped. The area of any driveways in the setback area is not included in the bonusable area. For area eligible for a bonus, the average setback from the abutting green street lot line shall not exceed 10 feet, with a maximum setback of 15 feet. The design of the setback area shall allow for public access, such as access to street level uses in abutting structures or access to areas for seating. The Director may grant an exception to the standards in this subsection 23.58A.016.C.4.c as a Type I decision, based on the Director's determination that the exception is consistent with a green street concept plan, if one exists, established in accordance with DR 11-2007, or a successor rule.

 d. Declaration. When open space is to be provided for purposes of obtaining bonus residential floor area, the owner(s) of the lot using the bonus residential floor area, and of the lot where the open space is provided, if different, shall execute and record a declaration and voluntary agreement in a form acceptable to the Director identifying the features; acknowledging that the right to develop and occupy a portion of the gross floor area on the lot is based upon the long-term provision and maintenance of the open space and that development is restricted in the open space; and committing to provide and maintain the open space.

 e. Identification. The open space shall be identified clearly with the City's public open space logo on a plaque placed at a visible location at each street entrance providing access to the feature. The plaque shall indicate, in letters legible to passersby, the nature of the bonus feature, its availability for general public access, and additional directional information as needed.

 f. Duration; Alteration. Except as provided for in this subsection 23.58A.016.C.4.f, the owners of the lot using the bonus residential floor area and of the lot where the open space amenity is located, if different, including all successors, shall provide and maintain the open space amenities for which bonus residential floor area is granted, in accordance with the applicable provisions of this Section 23.58A.016, for as long as the bonus residential floor area gained by the open space amenities exists. An open space amenity for which bonus residential floor area has been granted may be altered or removed only to the extent that either or both of the following occur, and alteration or removal may be further restricted by the provisions of the zone and by conditions of any applicable permit:

 1) The bonus residential floor area permitted in return for the specific open space amenity is removed or converted to a use for which bonus residential floor area is not required under the provisions of the zone; or

 2) An amount of bonus residential floor area equal to that allowed for the open space amenity that is to be diminished or discontinued is provided through alternative means consistent with the provisions of the zone and provisions for allowing bonus residential floor area in this chapter.

 D. Payment option.

 1. There is no payment in lieu option for open space amenities other than neighborhood open space.

 2. Payment in lieu of providing neighborhood open space.

 a. In lieu of all or part of the performance option for neighborhood open space, an applicant may pay to the City an amount determined pursuant to this subsection if the Director determines, as a Type 1 decision, that the payment will contribute to public open space improvements abutting the lot or in the vicinity; that the improvements will meet the additional need for open space caused by the project and are feasible within a reasonable time; and that the applicant agrees to the specific improvements or to the general nature and location of the improvements.

 b. The amount of the payment is determined by multiplying the number of square feet of land that would be provided as neighborhood open space, by the sum of an estimated land value per square foot based on recent transactions in the area and an average square foot cost for open space improvements. The dollar amount per square foot shall be determined by the Director based on any relevant information submitted by the applicant, and any other data related to land values and costs that the Director considers reliable.

 c. Cash payments shall be made prior to issuance, and as a condition to issuance, of the first building permit for a project, and in any event before any permit for any construction activity other than excavation and shoring is issued.

 d. Any payment in lieu of providing neighborhood open space shall be deposited in a dedicated fund or account solely to support acquisition or development of public open space within 0.25 mile of the lot using the bonus floor area, or within another area prescribed by the provisions of the zone, or at another location where the applicant and the Director agree that it will mitigate the direct impacts of the project, and the payment shall be expended within five years of receipt for such purposes.

 Section 5. A new Section 23.58A.018 is added to Subchapter II of Chapter 23.58A of the Seattle Municipal Code, as follows:

 23.58A.018 Transfer of residential development potential

 A. Scope and Applicability.

 1. This Section 23.58A.018 contains rules for transfer of residential development potential to lots in areas for which other provisions of this title specifically refer to provisions of this Section 23.58A.018.

 2. Whether a lot may be eligible as a TDP sending site is determined by the provisions of the zone in which the lot is located. To be eligible as a sending lot for a specific category of TDP defined in this Chapter 23.58A, the lot must satisfy the applicable conditions of this Section 23.58A.018 except to the extent otherwise expressly stated in the provisions of the zone. Whether a lot is eligible as a TDP receiving lot, and whether the lot may receive TDP from another lot, and what categories of TDP the lot may receive, are determined by the provisions of the zone. The transfer of TDP and use of TDP on any receiving lot is subject to the limits and conditions in this chapter, the provisions of the zone, and all other applicable provisions of this title.

 B. TDP Required Before Construction. No permit after the first building permit, and in any event, no permit for any construction activity other than excavation and shoring, and no permit for occupancy of existing floor area by any use based upon TDP, will be issued for development that includes TDP until the applicant's possession of TDP is demonstrated to the satisfaction of the Director. ~~~~

C. General Standards for Sending Lots.

 1. TDP Calculation. The maximum amount of floor area that may be transferred is the amount by which the base residential floor area of the sending lot exceeds the sum of:

 a. any nonexempt residential floor area existing on the sending lot; plus

 b. any existing floor area of uses accessory to nonexempt residential uses, except to the extent that floor area is exempt from floor area limits under the provisions of the zone; plus

 c. any TDP previously transferred from the sending lot.

 2. Floor Area Limit After Transfer. After TDP is transferred from a sending lot the amount of residential floor area that may then be established on the sending lot, other than floor area exempt from limits on residential floor area under the provisions of the zone, shall be equal to the base residential floor area, plus any net amount of TDP previously transferred to that lot, minus the total of (a) the existing residential floor area on the lot, plus (b) the amount of TDP transferred from the lot.

 D. Standards for Landmark TDP sending lots. Landmark structures on sending lots from which Landmark TDP is transferred shall be rehabilitated and maintained as required by the Landmarks Preservation Board.

 E. Standards for open space TDP sending lots. The following standards apply unless provisions of the zone state otherwise:

 1. General conditions. Open space TDP sites must satisfy the conditions of this subsection 23.58A.018. E.1, unless an exception is granted by the Director:

 a. Each portion of the open space shall be accessible from each other portion of the open space without leaving the open space.

 b. The open space shall have a minimum area of 5,000 square feet.

 c. The open space shall be directly accessible from the sidewalk or another public open space, including access for persons with disabilities.

 d. The open space shall be at ground level, except that in order to provide level open spaces on steep lots, some separation of multiple levels may be allowed, provided they are physically and visually connected.

 e. No more than 20 percent of the lot may be occupied by any above grade structures.

 f. The lot shall be located a minimum of 0.25 mile from the closest lot approved by the Director as a separate open space TDP site, unless the lot is abutting another TDP site and is designed to integrate with the other TDP site.

 g. The open space shall be open during daylight hours and accessible to the general public, without charge, for reasonable and predictable hours, for a minimum of 10 hours each day of the year, except that access may be limited temporarily as required for public safety and maintenance reasons. Within the open space, property owners, tenants and their agents shall allow members of the public to engage in activities allowed in the public sidewalk environment, except that those activities that would require a street use permit if conducted on the sidewalk may be excluded or restricted. Free speech activities such as hand billing, signature gathering, and holding signs, all without obstructing access to the space, any building, or other adjacent features, and without unreasonably interfering with the enjoyment of the space by others, shall be allowed. While engaged in allowed activities, members of the public may not be asked to leave for any reason other than conduct that unreasonably interferes with the enjoyment of the space by others unless the space is being closed to the general public consistent with this subsection 23.58A.018.E.1.g.

 h. The open space shall be identified clearly with the City's public open space logo on a plaque placed at a visible location at each street entrance providing access to the feature. The plaque shall indicate, in letters legible to passersby, the nature of the bonus feature, its availability for general public access, and additional directional information as needed.

 i. Unless the open space will be in public ownership, the applicant shall make adequate provision to ensure the permanent maintenance of the open space.

 2. Special exception for open space TDP sites. The Director may grant, or grant with conditions, an exception to the standards for open space TDP sites in this subsection 23.58A.018.E and any applicable Director's Rule(s), as a special exception pursuant to Chapter 23.76, Procedures for Master Use Permit and Council Land Use Decisions. In determining whether to grant, grant with conditions, or deny a request for special exception under this subsection, the Director shall consider:

 a. the extent to which the exception would result in an open space TDP site that better meets the intent of the provisions of this subsection 23.58A.018.E; and

 b. the extent to which the exception would allow the design of the open space to take advantage of unusual site characteristics or conditions in the surrounding area, such as views and relationship to surroundings.

 3. After any TDP is transferred from an open space TDP site, lot coverage by structures shall be permanently limited to 20 percent, or any greater amount that was allowed as a special exception prior to the transfer, and no development shall be permitted that would be inconsistent with the standards under which it was approved as an open space TDP sending site.

 F. Time of Determination of TDP Eligible for Transfer. The eligibility of a sending lot to transfer TDP, and the amount transferable from a sending lot, shall be determined as of the date of transfer from the sending lot and shall not be affected by the date of any application, permit decision or other action for any project seeking to use the TDP.

 G. Reservation in Deed. Any TDP eligible for transfer may instead be reserved in the conveyance of title to an eligible sending lot, by the express terms of the deed or other instrument of conveyance reserving a specified amount of TDP, provided that an instrument acceptable to the Director is recorded binding the lot to the terms and conditions for eligibility to send TDP under this section 23.58A.018. Any TDP so reserved shall be considered transferred from that lot and later may be conveyed by deed without participation of the owner of the lot.

 H. TDP Deeds and Agreements.

 1. The fee owners of the sending lot shall execute a deed, and shall obtain the release of the TDP from all liens of record and the written consent of all holders of encumbrances on the sending lot other than easements and restrictions, unless the requirement for a release or consent is waived by the Director for good cause. The deed shall be recorded in the King County real property records. When TDP is conveyed to the owner of a receiving lot described in the deed, then unless otherwise expressly stated in the deed or any subsequent instrument conveying the lot or the TDP, the TDP shall pass with the receiving lot whether or not a structure using the TDP shall have been permitted or built prior to any conveyance of the receiving lot. Any subsequent conveyance of TDP previously conveyed to a receiving lot shall require the written consent of all parties holding any interest in or lien on the receiving lot from which the conveyance is made. If the TDP is transferred other than directly from the sending lot to the receiving lot using the TDP, then after the initial transfer, all subsequent transfers also shall be by deed, duly executed, acknowledged and recorded, each referring by King County recording number to the prior deed.

 2. Any person may purchase any TDP that is eligible for transfer by complying with the applicable provisions of this Section 23.58A.018, whether or not the purchaser is then an applicant for a permit to develop real property or is the owner of any potential receiving lot. Any purchaser of the TDP (including any successor or assignee) may use the TDP to obtain floor area above the applicable base height limit or base floor area limit on a receiving lot to the extent that use of TDP is permitted under the Land Use Code provisions applicable with respect to the issuance of permits for development of the project intended to use the TDP. The Director may require, as a condition of processing any permit application using TDP or for the release of any security posted in lieu of a deed for TDP to the receiving lot, that the owner of the receiving lot demonstrate that the TDP has been validly transferred of record to the receiving lot, and that the owner has recorded in the real estate records a notice of the filing of such permit application, stating that the TDP is not available for retransfer.

 3. As a condition to the effective transfer of Landmark TDP, except from a City-owned sending lot, the fee owner of the sending lot shall execute and record an agreement running with the land, in form and content acceptable to, and accepted in writing by, the Director of the Department of Neighborhoods, providing for the rehabilitation and maintenance of the historically significant or other relevant features of the structure or structures on the lot and acknowledging the restrictions on future development resulting from the transfer. The Director may require evidence that each holder of a lien has effectively subordinated the lien to the terms of the agreement, and that any holders of interests in the property have agreed to its terms. To the extent that a Landmark structure on the sending lot, or an historically significant structure on a sending lot in a special review district, the presence of which is a condition to eligibility to transfer TDP under the provisions of the zone, requires restoration or rehabilitation for the long-term preservation of the structure or its historically or architecturally significant features, the Director of the Department of Neighborhoods may require, as a condition to acceptance of the necessary agreement, that the owner of the sending site apply for and obtain a certificate of approval from the Landmarks Preservation Board, or from the Department of Neighborhoods Director after review by the Pioneer Square Preservation Board or International Special Review District Board, as applicable, for the necessary work, or post security satisfactory to the Director of the Department of Neighborhoods for the completion of the restoration or rehabilitation, or both.

 Section 6. The provisions of this ordinance are declared to be separate and severable. The invalidity of any particular provision, or its invalidity as applied in any circumstances, shall not affect the validity of any other provision or the application of the particular provision in other circumstances.

 Section 7. This ordinance shall take effect and be in force thirty (30) days from and after its approval by the Mayor, but if not approved and returned by the Mayor within ten (10) days after presentation, it shall take effect as provided by Municipal Code Section 1.04.020.
