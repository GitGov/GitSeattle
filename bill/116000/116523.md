 and the UNITED STATES OF AMERICA, hereinafter called the Government:

 WHEREAS, the parties hereto desire to amend the above Lease.

 NOW THEREFORE, effective January 1, 2009, these parties for the considerations hereinafter mentioned covenant and agree that the said Lease is amended, as follows:

 Clause "2. Term" is replaced with the following:

 2. Term:

 To have and to hold, for the term commencing on January 1, 1999. This extension of Lease No. DTFA11-00-L-00011 will continue through December 31, 2018 inclusive, PROVIDED, that adequate appropriations are available from year to year for the payment of rentals. The Government may terminate this lease, in whole or in part, at any time, by giving thirty (30) days notice in writing to the Lessor, and no rental shall accrue after the effective date of termination. Said notice shall be sent by certified or registered mail, and shall be computed commencing with the day after the date of mailing.

 Clause "3. Consideration" is replaced with the following:

 3. Consideration (Cost) (Aug 02):

 The Government shall pay the Lessor rental for the premises in the amount of $8,890.08 per annum, payable at the rate of $2,222.52 per quarter during the lease period. Payments shall be made in arrears at the end of each calendar quarter without the submission of invoices or vouchers. The payments shall be made to: Seattle Public Utilities, Account Receivable, PO Box 34018, Seattle, WA, 98124- 4018 or directly deposited in accordance with the Electronic Funds Transfer (EFT) Payment clause in this lease. Payments shall be considered paid on the day a check is dated or an electronic funds transfer is made.

 Clause "14. Additional Provisions" of the original lease no longer applies and is removed from the Lease Agreement.

 Clause "5. Electronic Funds Transfer Payment (EFT)" is replaced with the following:

 5. Payment by Electronic Fund Transfer (Oct 06):

 (a) Method of payment.

 1. All payments by the Government under this contract will be made by electronic funds transfer (EFT), except as provided in paragraph (a) (2) or (a) (3) of this lease. As used in this clause, the term "EFT" refers to the funds transfer and may also include the payment information transfer. Payment information transfer refers to the payment information normally sent with a payment to assist the contractor in associating the payment to specific contracts.

 2. In the event the Government is unable to release one or more payments by EFT, the Contractor agrees to either:

 a. Accept payment by check or

 b. Request the Government to extend the payment due date until such time as the Government can make payment by EFT (but see paragraph (d) of this clause).

 3. In the event that the Contractor is granted a waiver from EFT under the exceptions as provided for in FAA AMS Section T3.3.1.A-7, the Government payments will be made by check. A waiver from EFT is not permanent, and the Contractor must register for EFT when the circumstances that justified the waiver change.

 (b) Contractor's EFT information. The Government will make payment to the Contractor using the EFT information contained in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) database. In the event that the EFT information changes, the Contractor will be responsible for providing the updated information to the CCR database (Reference Clause, "Central Contractor Registration - Real Property"). If the Contractor is granted an exemption from CCR, the contractor will follow the requirements of alternate clause "Contractor Payment Information - Non-CCR".

 (c) Mechanisms for EFT payment. The Government may make payment by EFT through either the Automated Clearing House (ACH) network, subject to the rules of the National Automated Clearing House Association, or the Fedwire Transfer System. The rules governing Federal payments through the ACH are contained in 31 CFR Part 210.

 (d) Suspension of payment. If the Contractor's EFT information in the CCR database is incorrect, then the Government is not required to make payments to the Contractor under this contract until correct EFT information is entered into the CCR database, and any invoice or contract financing request submitted during this period of noncompliance will be deemed not to be a proper invoice for the purpose of prompt payment under this contract. In such instances, the late interest payment terms of the contract regarding notice of an improper invoice and delays in accrual of interest penalties apply.

 (e) Liability for incomplete or erroneous transfers.

 (1) If an incomplete or erroneous transfer occurs because the Government used the Contractor's EFT information incorrectly, the Government remains responsible for,

 (i) Making a correct payment;

 (ii) Paying any late payment penalty due; and

 (iii) Recovering any erroneously directed funds.

 (2) If an incomplete or erroneous transfer occurs because the Contractor's EFT information was incorrect, or was revised within 30 days of Government release of the EFT payment transaction instruction to the Federal Reserve System, and,

 (i) If the funds are no longer under the control of the payment office, the Government is deemed to have made payment and the Contractor is responsible for recovery of any erroneously directed funds; or

 (ii) If the funds remain under the control of the payment office, the Government will make payment under the provisions of paragraph (d "Suspension of Payment".

 (f) EFT and payment terms. A payment will be deemed to have been made in a timely manner in accordance with the payment terms of this contract if, in the EFT payment transaction instruction released to the Federal Reserve System, the date specified for settlement of the payment is on or before the payment due date, provided the specified payment date is a valid date under the rules of the Federal Reserve System.

 (g) EFT and assignment of claims. If the Contractor assigns the proceeds of this contract, as provided for in the assignment of claims terms of this contract, the Contractor will require that the assignee register separately in the CCR database and that the assignee agree that payments will be made by EFT in accordance with the terms of this clause. The requirements of this clause will apply to the assignee as if it were the Contractor. EFT information that shows the ultimate recipient of the transfer to be other than the Contractor or the CCR registered assignee is incorrect EFT information within the meaning of paragraph (d) "Suspension of Payment" clause.

 (h) EFT and Change of Name or Ownership Changes. If the Contractor transfers ownership of the property under lease or changes its business name, it will follow the requirements of section (g) of clause, "Central Contractor Registration - Real Property".

 (i) Liability for change of EFT information by financial agent. The Government is not liable for errors resulting from changes to EFT information made by the Contractor's financial agent.

 (j) Payment information. The accounting office will forward to the Contractor available payment information that is suitable for transmission as of the date of release of the EFT instruction to the Federal Reserve System. The Government may request the Contractor to designate a desired format and method(s) for delivery of payment information from a list of formats and methods the payment office is capable of executing. However, the Government does not guarantee that any particular format or method of delivery is available at any particular payment office and retains the latitude to use the format and delivery method most convenient to the Government. The Contractor can obtain detailed payment information by registering for the US Treasury PAID system. This can be done on the internet by logging onto the website: https://fmsapps.treas.gov/paid/. If the Government makes payment by check in accordance with paragraph (a) of this clause, the Government will mail the payment information to the remittance address contained in the contract and CCR database.

 Contractor identification is essential for receiving payment and complying with statutory contract reporting requirements. Therefore, the offeror will provide its DUNS or DUNS+4 number below. The DUNS number will be used by the Contracting Officer to verify that the offeror is registered in the CCR database.

 DUNS OR DUNS+4 NUMBER: _________________________

 Certification of Registration in Central Contractor Registration (CCR) (Oct 06):

 (a) In accordance with clause, "Central Contractor Registration-Real Property", and by submission of this offer, the offeror certifies that they are registered in the CCR Database and have entered all mandatory information including the DUNS or DUNS+4 Number required in clause, "Contractor Identification Number-Data Universal Numbering System (DUNS) Number - Real Property".
