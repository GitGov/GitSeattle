 AN ORDINANCE relating to the City Light Department; authorizing a 10-year agreement with Pend Oreille County for (1) the loss of revenues and additional financial burdens associated with the City of Seattle's operation of the Boundary Hydroelectric Project on the Pend Oreille River pursuant to RCW 35.21.420, .425, .426, and .427, and (2) the County's agreement to settle all issues relating to City Light's relicensing of the Boundary Hydroelectric Project and the related Sullivan Creek Power Project license surrender.

 WHEREAS, the City Light Department ("City Light") operates a hydroelectric generating facility (the "Boundary Project") in Pend Oreille County (the "County") and said facility was constructed after March 17, 1955; and

 WHEREAS, the Revised Code of Washington ("RCW") 35.21.425 requires any city that constructs a hydroelectric generating project after March 17, 1955, in a county other than the county in which such city is located, to enter into an agreement with such county that provides for loss of revenue and other financial burdens in providing for the public peace, health, safety, welfare, and added road maintenance in such county, in addition to road construction or relocation as well as any loss of revenue and/or increases to the financial burden of any school district affected by the construction because of an increase in the number of pupils by reason of the construction or the operation of said generating facilities; and

 WHEREAS, the previous agreement between City Light and the County expired by its own terms on December 31, 2008, and the Parties began negotiations on a new agreement; and

 WHEREAS, in December 2009, the County intervened in City Light's Boundary Project Relicensing matter pending at the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission ("FERC"), FERC Docket No. 2144-038 ( the "Boundary Project Relicensing") and filed comments opposing the relicensing based on the inability to reach agreement with City Light pursuant to RCW 35.21.420, .425, .426, and .427; and

 WHEREAS, in June 2010, the County submitted negative comments in response to FERC's scoping notice in the related Sullivan Creek Power Project license surrender, FERC Docket Nos. DI07-1-000 and P-2225 (the "Sullivan Creek Surrender"); and

 WHEREAS, during the extended negotiating period the County lobbied the Washington state legislature for changes to RCW 35.21.420 and 425; and

 WHEREAS, in early 2010, in light of extended negotiations, City Light agreed to make an interim payment to the County providing for payments to the County for the calendar year 2009 based on the 2008 payment under the 1999 Contract combined with an escalator payment; and

 WHEREAS, the County and City Light have reached monetary agreements for payments made by City Light to the County for the years 2010 through 2019, including payments made by the County on behalf of City Light to the towns of Metaline, Metaline Falls, and Ione, and the Selkirk, Cusick and Newport School Districts, as more fully set forth in the 2010 Agreement between the City of Seattle and Pend Oreille County attached hereto as Attachment A;

 WHEREAS, this agreement will provide for certain payments to the County for the loss of revenue and increased cost to the County, the Selkirk, Cusick and Newport School Districts and the towns of Metaline, Metaline Falls, and Ione due to City Light's operation of the Boundary Project pursuant to RCW 35.21.420, .425, .426, and .427; and

 WHEREAS, the agreement also includes a resolution of all matters raised by the County in connection with City Light's Boundary Project Relicensing and the related Sullivan Creek Surrender, requiring the County's express support of City Light's Boundary Project relicensing efforts through 2019; and

 WHEREAS, the County has reached agreement with the Selkirk, Cusick and Newport School Districts, and the Towns of Metaline Falls, Metaline and Ione on the amounts of money each entity shall receive from the County on behalf of City Light, howsoever warranted or entitled; NOW, THEREFORE,

 BE IT ORDAINED BY THE CITY OF SEATTLE AS FOLLOWS:

 Section 1. The Superintendant of City Light, or his designee, is hereby authorized for and on behalf of The City of Seattle to execute and deliver a ten year agreement with Pend Oreille County providing for payment to Pend Oreille County and certain school districts and towns adjacent to the Boundary Project, substantially in the form of the agreement attached hereto as Attachment A (the "2010 Agreement"). The 2010 Agreement provides for annual payments for the years 2010 through 2019, inclusive, to Pend Oreille County, the Selkirk, Cusick, and Newport School Districts and the towns of Metaline, Metaline Falls, and Ione. As specified in the 2010 Agreement, certain portions of the payments are made pursuant to RCW 35.21.420, .425, .426, and .427 and are based on an agreed upon methodology that uses a component of the compensation methodology for state taxation of public utility districts, continuing the same payment methodology used in the previous agreement between City Light and Pend Oreille County. The remaining portions of the payments are for Pend Oreille County's agreement to settle all of the issues raised by Pend Oreille County in the Boundary Project Relicensing and the related Sullivan Creek Surrender and require Pend Oreille County's express support of City Light's Boundary Project relicensing efforts.

 Section 2. Any act pursuant to the authority of this ordinance and prior to its effective date is hereby ratified and confirmed.

 Section 3. This ordinance shall take effect and be in force 30 days from and after its approval by the Mayor; but if not approved and returned by the Mayor within ten days after presentation, it shall take effect as provided by Seattle Municipal Code Section 1.04.020.
