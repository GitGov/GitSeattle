 WHEREAS, the Seattle Ethics and Elections Commission has recommended that the Seattle Municipal Code be amended to prohibit officers and employees from being indemnified by the City against fines imposed by the Commission for violations of the Ethics Code; and

 WHEREAS, the Commission also recommended that the costs of any defense provided by the City to an employee charged with an ethics violation be recovered if the employee is determined to have intentionally violated the Ethics Code, and

 WHEREAS, there currently exists a method to accomplish recovery of defense costs through the process of reservation of rights by the City, but legislation is necessary to amend the code to prevent employees from being indemnified by the City against for fines imposed by the Commission, NOW, THEREFORE,

 BE IT ORDAINED BY THE CITY OF SEATTLE AS FOLLOWS:

 Section 1. Section 4.64.016, last amended by Ordinance 117655, is amended as follows:

 In the event there is made against any City officers or employees any administrative charge of misconduct which is the subject of any proceedings before any administrative tribunal of any City, state, or federal agency that ~~which~~ may lead to the administrative imposition of a monetary penalty, the making of any recommendation regarding the City employment of the officer or employee, or the imposition of any discipline or sanction related to a professional license, the officer or employee shall be entitled to request that the City defend the officer or employee in such administrative proceedings. Any City employee or officer~~The Mayor or subordinate departmental employees~~ shall make their request for defense to the Chief of the Civil Division of the Law Department. Thereafter, the Chief of the Civil Division of the Law Department shall, after receiving a report and recommendation regarding the request from the relevant department head, make a determination as to whether the acts or omissions which form the basis of the administrative charge and proceeding arose in the course and scope of City employment. Department heads and the presiding officers of City boards or commissions shall make their request for defense to the Mayor, who shall, after receiving a report and recommendation regarding the request from the Chief of the Civil Division of the Law Department, make the determination as to whether the acts or omissions which form the basis of the administrative charge and proceeding arose in the course and scope of City employment. If the determination is made that such acts or omissions arose in the course and scope of City employment then the City shall defend the officer or employee in such administrative proceedings, including any judicial review of such proceedings. There shall be no appeal from such determinations made by the Mayor or the Chief of the Civil Division of the Law Department. If the determination is made that the City will defend in administrative proceedings, other than a proceeding involving a charge brought by the Executive Director of the Ethics and Elections Commission, the City will indemnify the officer or employee with respect to any monetary penalty imposed, subject to any reservation of rights exercised under SMC 4.64.015. The City will not indemnify any officer or employee with respect to any monetary penalty imposed on a charge brought by the Executive Director of the Ethics and Elections Commission.

 The duty to defend in administrative proceedings and the indemnification of any monetary penalty is subject to the limitations and reservations contained in SMC Section 4.64.015.
