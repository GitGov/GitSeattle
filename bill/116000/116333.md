 AN ORDINANCE related to the City of Seattle's 2007 LTGO bonds; amending the 2008 Adopted Budget by changing appropriations to various funds, departments, and budget control levels; and ratifying and confirming certain prior acts.

 WHEREAS, through the Operations and Management Agreement (Agreement) between the City of Seattle and the Woodland Park Zoological Society (Society), amended by Ordinance 121620 in October 2004, the City agreed to finance up to $16.2 million adjusted for inflation to reimburse the Society for the construction of a parking garage at the Woodland Park Zoo, no sooner than March 1, 2007; and
