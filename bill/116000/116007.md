 AMENDED PROPERTY USE AND DEVELOPMENT AGREEMENT

 THIS AMENDED PROPERTY USE AND DEVELOPMENT AGREEMENT (herein "Amended PUDA") is executed this date in favor of The City of Seattle, a municipal corporation (herein "City"), by the Central Puget Sound Regional Transit Authority, known as Sound Transit, which is the undersigned Owner of the property described herein.

 WITNESSETH:

 WHEREAS, On January 25, 1993, the City Council of the City of Seattle passed Ordinance 116543 amending the Official Land Use Map of the City to rezone the following described property (herein "Property") from Single-Family 5000 to Commercial One/40-foot height limit (C1-40):

 Lots 1 through 6, Block 9, Empire Way Addition to the City of Seattle, as per plat recorded in Volume 22 of Plats, page 2, records of King County, Washington;

 TOGETHER WITH the adjoining vacated east-west alley, said alley vacated by Ordinance 80495;

 TOGETHER WITH the west half of the north-south alley in said block, said alley proposed to be vacated under Comptroller File No. 298611;

 WHEREAS, Ordinance 116543 also accepted a Property Use and Development Agreement from the then owners of the Property, Gill A. Centioli and Alma Centioli, in which these owners agreed, on behalf of themselves and their successors and assigns, to certain restrictions upon the property to ameliorate the adverse impacts of uses and developments otherwise permitted in the C1-40 zone;

 WHEREAS, the restrictions in this 1993 PUDA were based upon the Centiolis' intended use of the property for surface parking and loading for the adjacent commercial warehouses that they owned on the eastern half of the block, fronting on Martin Luther King Jr. Way South;

 WHEREAS, Sound Transit in 2003 acquired from the Centioli family the Property and the adjoining property on which the commercial warehouse was sited, in order to use both properties together as a staging area for construction of the Central Link Light Rail System, and in preparing the site for use as a staging area, Sound Transit razed the commercial warehouse so that the use to which the Property is limited by the 1993 PUDA no longer exists;

 WHEREAS, Sound Transit has requested that the City Council approve minor amendments to the PUDA that would be within the spirit and general purpose of the existing PUDA but that would allow the Property to be used for purposes other than parking and loading for a commercial warehouse that no longer exists;

 WHEREAS, on September 26, 2007 the City Council's Urban Development & Planning Committee voted to amend the draft PUDA, as introduced, to redact Section 3 related to termination of the PUDA, and to approve this Amended PUDA with the conditions set forth below, subject to the execution of this Amended PUDA before its approval by the full Council;

 NOW, THEREFORE, Sound Transit hereby agrees, bargains and covenants on behalf of itself, its successors and assigns, that it will comply with the following conditions upon the City Council's acceptance by ordinance of this Amended PUDA to replace and supersede the 1993 PUDA:

 Section 1. Terms of agreement. The Property will be developed and used in accordance with the following conditions:

 A. Buildings or portions of buildings within the Property shall be limited to a cumulative total of 25,000 square feet of gross floor area, shall be compatible in scale and appearance with residential use, and shall be oriented so that doors or other large openings face east, north, or south but not west.

 B. Any portion of a building within 70 feet of the western property line shall be limited to 20 feet in height, with the same allowances for rooftop features and height exceptions as are allowed elsewhere in commercial zones pursuant to the provisions of SMC 23.47A.012.

 C. A ten-foot wide landscaped buffer shall be established and maintained along the western boundary of the Property, with landscaping appropriate to creating both a visual screen and noise attenuation, as approved by the Department of Planning and Development. The trees within the planting strip at the time of execution of this Amended PUDA shall be retained to the extent healthy, and if not healthy, replaced with new street trees. All plants within the buffer shall be replaced when dead, dying or diseased. Replacement plants shall be of a size and species similar to the original plants.

 D. All construction activities on the Property shall be subject to the requirements of the Noise Ordinance, and in addition, in order to reduce the noise impact of construction on nearby residential properties, all construction activities shall be limited to non- holiday weekdays between 7:00 a.m. and 6:00 p.m. except as provided herein. In addition, only low noise impact work such as that listed below, shall be permitted on Saturdays from 9:00 a.m. to 6:00 p.m. and on Sundays from 10:00 a.m. to 6:00 p.m.:

 - Surveying and layout;

 - Other ancillary tasks to construction activities including site security, surveillance, monitoring, and maintenance of weather protection, water dams and heating equipment.

 After a building is enclosed with exterior walls and windows, interior construction may be performed at other times in accordance with the Noise Ordinance. It is recognized that there may be occasions when critical construction activities could be performed in the evenings and on weekends, which are of an emergency nature, related to issues of safety, or which could substantially shorten the total construction time frame if conducted during these hours. Therefore, the hours may be extended and/or specific types of construction activities may be permitted on a case-by-case basis by approval of the Department of Planning and Development prior to each occurrence.

 E. In order to prevent commercial vehicles from using streets adjoining the residential area, direct access to the Property shall be restricted to South Findlay and South Orcas Streets from Martin Luther King Jr. Way South, with no direct access permitted from 35th Avenue South. Prior to issuance of a Master Use Permit the Owners shall submit a letter to DPD indicating compliance with these conditions. The letter shall state that the Owners agree for the life of the development to notify all present and future truck drivers of this restriction.

 F. In order to prevent commercial vehicles from using streets adjoining the residential area, the Owners shall post signs at each driveway prohibiting trucks from turning west into the residential neighborhood from the Property. The signs shall be prepared by the Owners and approved by the Seattle Department of Transportation. The Owners shall install the signs prior to the completion of construction, and shall maintain the signs at their respective locations for the life of the development.

 Section 2. Agreement runs with the land. This Amended PUDA shall be recorded in the records of King County by the City Clerk. The covenants hereof attach to and run with the Property, and shall be binding upon the Owner, its successors and assigns, and shall apply to after-acquired title of the Owner in the Property.

 Section 3. Amendment. This Amended PUDA may be amended or modified by agreement between the Owners and the City, provided that such amended agreement shall be approved by the City Council by ordinance. Nothing in this Amended PUDA shall prevent the City Council from making such further amendments to the Land Use Code as it may deem necessary in the public interest.

 Section 4. No Precedent. The conditions contained in this Agreement are based on the unique circumstances applicable to this Property and this Agreement is not intended to establish precedent for other rezones in the surrounding area.

 Section 5. Benefited. This Agreement is made for the benefit of the City and for the benefit of the owners of property within 300 feet of the Property and either the City or any such property owners may institute and prosecute any proceeding at law or in equity to enforce this Agreement.

 Section 6. Repeal as Additional Remedy. Owner acknowledges that compliance with the conditions of this Agreement is a condition of the subject rezone and that if Owner avails itself of the benefits of this rezone but then fails to comply with the conditions of this Agreement with the City, in addition to pursuing any other remedy, the City may revoke the rezone by ordinance and require the use of the Property to conform to the requirements of the SF 5000 zone established prior to the rezone.

 Section 7. This Amended PUDA shall supersede and replace the PUDA dated January 5, 1993, that was recorded under King County Recording No. 9301120667 and as an attachment to Ordinance No. 116543 under King County Recording No. 9302171384.
