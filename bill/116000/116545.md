The system will provide reliable, frequent service with headways of approximately 10 minutes during peak periods and operate the same hours as the light rail system (at least 20 hours per day Monday through Saturday and at least 12 hours per day Sundays). A light maintenance vehicle storage base and procurement of a six-vehicle streetcar fleet is also included in the scope of the project.
