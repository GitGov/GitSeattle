 ORDINANCE _________________

 AN ORDINANCE relating to the City's lease of warehouse space at 3601 2nd Avenue South in Seattle; authorizing the Fleets and Facilities Department Director, on behalf of the Seattle Fire Department, to execute an amendment to a lease agreement with MUSREF Spokane Street, LP, approved by Ordinance 116571; amending the 2008 Adopted Budget by increasing the Seattle Fire Department 2008 Budget appropriation in order to pay for the lease; all by a three-fourths vote of the City Council.

 WHEREAS, Ordinance 116571 authorized the Fleets and Facilities Department to enter into a lease agreement with Schnitzer Investment Corporation for use and occupancy of certain real property located at 3601 2nd Avenue South in Seattle; and

 WHEREAS, MUSREF Spokane Street, LP is the successor to all Schnitzer Investment Corporation's rights, obligations, and interests in the subject property and under the lease agreement for that property; and

 WHEREAS, the original ten-year lease, executed in 1993, was amended by a First Amendment, executed in 2003, to provide a five-year lease extension ending January 31, 2008; and

 WHEREAS, the Seattle Fire Department anticipates a continuing need for the amount of currently leased warehouse space for up to an additional five years; and

 WHEREAS, this amount of needed warehouse space cannot be accommodated within City-owned buildings for the foreseeable future; and

 WHEREAS, the current warehouse location meets the Seattle Fire Department's operational requirements and is more cost effective than moving to an alternative location; and

 WHEREAS, Seattle Municipal Code 3.18.240 requires City Council approval of the lease amendment, because the total warehouse square footage leased in one calendar year exceeds 9,000 square feet; and

 WHEREAS, it is standard City practice for the Fleets and Facilities Department to procure leased warehouse space on behalf of the Seattle Fire Department, pay rent to the landlord for such leased space, and subsequently receive reimbursement from the Seattle Fire Department; and

 WHEREAS, a Second Amendment to extend the lease for an additional five years includes an increase in rent expense, and the Seattle Fire Department requires additional appropriation authority to pay for that increased expense; NOW, THEREFORE,

 BE IT ORDAINED BY THE CITY OF SEATTLE AS FOLLOWS:

 Exhibit 1 - Second Amendment of Lease E x h i b i t 1

 SECOND AMENDMENT OF LEASE

 THIS SECOND AMENDMENT OF LEASE is made in duplicate as of this _____day of ____________, 2008 by and between MUSREF SPOKANE STREET LP, a Washington limited partnership ("Lessor") and THE CITY OF SEATTLE, a municipal corporation duly organized and existing under the laws of the State of Washington ("Lessee").

 RECITALS

 A. On or about February 4, 1993, Lessee entered into a lease agreement with Schnitzer Investment Corp. (the "Lease") for use and occupancy of certain real property located at 3601 2nd Ave. South, Seattle, Washington, and legally described in the Lease (the "Premises"). MUSREF SPOKANE STREET LP is the successor to all Schnitzer's rights, obligations, and interests in the Premises and under the Lease.

 B. The Lease term was extended pursuant to the terms and conditions set forth in the First Amendment signed on January 28, 2003 and February 14, 2003 (the "First Amendment"), which extended term expires January 31, 2008. Additionally, the Lease includes terms and conditions stated in an Addendum effective June 30, 2000.

 C. Lessee and Lessor desire to extend the Lease, subject to the terms and conditions set forth in this Second Amendment (the "Second Amendment").

 D. Capitalized terms used in this Second Amendment shall have the meanings given to them in the Lease, except as amended by this Second Amendment.

 In consideration of the mutual covenants and conditions contained herein and for other good and valuable consideration, Lessor and Lessee agree as follows:

 1. EXTENSION TERM: The term of the Lease is hereby extended for an additional

 five (5) year period, commencing February 1, 2008, and shall expire at midnight on January 31, 2013 (the "Extension Term"). The Extension Term shall be upon the same terms and conditions as set forth in the Lease and the First Amendment, except as otherwise expressly provided herein.

 2. RENT: Effective March 1, 2008, Lessee shall pay to Lessor basic monthly rent (the "Rent"), as follows:

 3/1/2008 - 1/31/2009 $9,696.20 per month

 2/1/2009 - 1/31/2010 $9,987.09 per month

 2/1/2010 - 1/31/2011 $10,286.70 per month

 2/1/2011 - 1/31/2012 $10,595.30 per month

 1/1/2012 - 1/31/2013 $10,913.16 per month

 4. BROKER: Lessee represents and warrants to Lessor that it has not retained or used a real estate broker or agent in connection with this Lease. Based upon the accuracy of this representation, Lessor agrees to provide Lessee with $15,000 allowance (the "Allowance") toward the cost of Tenant Improvements, including but not limited to those provided for in paragraph 5 below.

 5. TENANT IMPROVEMENTS:

 (a) Lessee has advised Lessor that Lessee would like to improve the Premises by installing an emergency generator that shall become property of the Lessee upon payment, as provided for in paragraph 5(b) below, and associated enclosure (the "Tenant Improvements"). Lessee shall remove the Lessee Improvements at the end of the Lease term and restore the Premises to its pre-existing condition, repairing any damage resulting from such removal. If Lessee wishes to proceed with the Tenant Improvements, it shall provide Lessor with a preliminary design and plans and specifications, prepared by a mutually agreed upon contractor, for the Tenant Improvements for Lessor's review and approval thereof, which approval will not be unreasonably delayed or denied. Lessor shall approve the design and plans and specifications within thirty (30) days after receipt of same or provide Lessee with an alternative proposal. The Lessor and Lessee will use diligent efforts to promptly finalize the design and plans and specifications and cost schedule, and once mutually approved, the Lessor shall proceed with diligence to cause the Tenant Improvements to be constructed and installed based on the mutually approved design and plans and specifications. After completion, Lessor will provide Lessee with a schedule of the costs which it incurred in connection with the design, permitting, construction, management and construction of the Tenant Improvements (the "Cost Schedule").

 (b) Lessee shall have thirty (30) days from its receipt of the Cost Schedule within which to either reimburse Lessor for such costs, less the Allowance. Interest shall accrue on the cost schedule at the rate of one percent (1%) per month from date delivered until paid.

 (c) Lessee's rights under this paragraph 5 shall terminate unless Lessee has provided Lessor with a preliminary design and plans and specifications for the Tenant Improvements by March 1, 2009. In no event shall Lessor be obligated to proceed with the Tenant Improvements if the cost thereof will exceed One Hundred Thousand Dollars ($100,000).

 6. INSURANCE: Section 5 of the First Amendment, amending Section 8 of Part B "General Terms and Conditions" of the Lease, is omitted in its entirety and replaced with the following:

 Insurance: The Lessor shall secure and maintain in effect during the full term of this lease, and any extensions thereof, property and commercial liability insurance having policy limits in the amount set forth in Part A hereof. The Lessor acknowledges and accepts the Lessee's general liability insurance program, and Lessee is not required to insure the Premises or provide Lessor with any insurance coverage.

 7. EFFECT OF AMENDMENT: Lessor and Lessee intend the Second Amendment to continue the existing Lease Agreement. So long as this Second Amendment is approved by the Seattle City Council and signed by both parties, this Second Amendment shall be effective as of February 1, 2008, regardless of the date of execution. Except as expressly amended by the Addendum, First Amendment and this Second Amendment, the Lease remains unmodified and in full force and effect as written.

 IN WITNESS WHEREOF, Lessor and Lessee have executed this Second Amendment as of the date first above written.
