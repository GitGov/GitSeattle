Donee will cooperate with Donor to execute Internal Revenue Service Form 8283, Part IV, Donee Acknowledgement, upon request of Donor.

 3. Escrow; Closing

 Donee, at its expense, will open an escrow with Pacific Northwest Title Company ("Title Company") for the purpose of closing the conveyance of the Property no later than October 5, 2009.

Current real property taxes and utilities charges payable during the year in which closing occurs shall be prorated as of closing.

 5. Title
