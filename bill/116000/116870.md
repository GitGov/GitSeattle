 THIS PROPERTY USE AND DEVELOPMENT AGREEMENT (the "Agreement") is executed this _____ day of _____________, 2010, in favor of the CITY OF SEATTLE (the "City"), a Washington municipal corporation, by Ezra Teshome (the "Owner").

 RECITALS

 A. Ezra Teshome is the owner of that certain real property (the "Property") in the City of Seattle zoned Neighborhood Commercial 3 Pedestrian with a 40 foot height limit (NC3P-40) and described as:

 LOT 11 AND LOT 12, BLOCK 22, NAGLES ADDITION TO THE CITY OF SEATTLE ACCORDING TO THE PLAT THEREOF, RECORDED IN VOL 1 OF PLATS, PAGE 153, RECORDS OF KING COUNTY, WASHINGTON.

 B. On June 10, 2008, the Owner submitted to the City of Seattle an application for a rezone from Neighborhood Commercial 3 with a 40 foot height limit (NC3-40) to Neighborhood Commercial 3 with a 65-foot height limit (NC3-65). The purpose of the application is to allow the Property to be used for mixed-use, commercial and multi-family residential development of greater density.

 C. On July 8, 2009, the City Council approved Ordinance 123020, which changed the zoning of the rezone site, in part by adopting a Pedestrian (P) designation and eliminating a Station Area Overlay Designation on the rezone site. The change was part of an area-wide effort to rezone properties related to the Pike/Pine Conservation District. The zoning of the site changed to NC3P-40.

 D. Seattle Municipal Code (SMC) Section 23.34.004 allows the City to approve a contract rezone subject to "self-imposed restrictions upon the use and development of the property in order to ameliorate adverse impacts that could occur from unrestricted use and development permitted by development regulations otherwise applicable after the rezone."

 NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the mutual agreements contained herein, the parties agree as follows:

 AGREEMENT

 Section 1. Agreement. Pursuant to 23.34.004, the Owner hereby covenants, bargains and agrees, on behalf of itself and its successors and assigns, that it will comply with the following limitations and conditions in consideration of the rezone of the Property from Neighborhood Commercial 3 Pedestrian with a 40 foot height limit (NC3P-40) to Neighborhood Commercial 3 Pedestrian with a 65-foot height limit (NC3P-65):

 1. Future development of the Property is restricted to a structure that substantially conforms to the final approved Master Use Permit decision dated January 7, 2010 (MUP 3007044).

 2. Use of the property is limited to approximately 6,798 square feet of ground level commercial uses, 75 residential units located on five floors above, and two levels of structured below-grade parking for 70 automobiles.

 Section 2. Agreement Runs With the Land. This Agreement shall be recorded in the records of King County by the City Clerk. The covenants hereof shall be deemed to attach to and run with the Property and shall be binding upon the Owner, its heirs, successors and assigns, and shall apply to after-acquired title of the Owner of the Property.

 Section 3. Termination. The covenants herein and the rezone shall expire two (2) years from the effective date of approval, unless, within the two (2) year period, an application is filed for a Master Use Permit, which permit is subsequently issued. The rezone remains in effect unless revoked pursuant to Section 23.34.004.

 Section 4. Amendment. This Agreement may be amended or modified by agreement between Owner and the City; provided, such amendment shall be approved by the legislative authority of the City by ordinance.

 Section 5. Exercise of Police Power. Nothing in this Agreement prevents the City Council from making such further amendments to the Seattle Municipal Code or Land Use Code as it may deem necessary in the public interest.

 Section 6. No Precedent. The conditions contained in this Agreement are based on the unique circumstances applicable to this Property and this Agreement is not intended to establish precedent for other rezones in the surrounding area.

 Section 7. Benefited. This Agreement is made for the benefit of the City and for the benefit of the owners of property within 300 feet of the Property and either the City or any such property owners may institute and prosecute any proceeding at law or in equity to enforce this Agreement.

 Section 8. Repeal as Additional Remedy. Owner acknowledges that compliance with the conditions of this Agreement is a condition of the rezone and that if Owner or its successor avails itself of the benefits of this rezone but then fails to comply with the conditions of this Agreement with the City, in addition to pursuing any other remedy, the City may revoke the rezone by ordinance and require the use of the Property to conform to the requirements of the Neighborhood Commercial 3 Pedestrian with a 40 foot height limit (NC3P-40) zone.
