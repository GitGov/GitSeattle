 Amendments to HomeWise Program Policies - Section 7.1.3 (Appendix C, Housing Policies)

 of the 2009-2012 Consolidated Plan

 HomeWise Program Policies, as last amended by Ordinance 123149, are amended as follows:

 HomeWise Program and Home Repair Program Policies

 OH's HomeWise and Home Repair Programs provide~~s~~ for low- interest home rehabilitation loans and weatherization services primarily for the purpose of improving the health, safety, and energy efficiency of housing for low-income households.

 Income limits for Home Repair Program rehabilitation loans vary by fund source, but in no case exceed 80% of median income. The maximum individual rehab loan is $45,000, with a waiver by the OH Director allowing up to $10,000 additional (for an overall total of $55,000) due to demonstrated health and safety needs. Interest rates generally are set at ~~3~~0% simple interest~~. Depending on the circumstances of the individual household,~~and the loan may be amortized or deferred. ~~HomeWise forgivable grants are available, up to $10,000, for lead-based paint abatement if required in a rehabilitation project. Grant terms require full repayment if the home is sold within 5 years and provide for forgiveness after 5 years.~~The program generally gives priority to loans for improving health and safety, and for curing code violations. The program also gives priority for repairs that address exterior dilapidation or conditions that would contribute to neighborhood revitalization in the Southeast Neighborhood District.

HomeWise Program w~~W~~eatherization services are provided for energy efficiency and health and safety improvements in owner- and renter- occupied single-family homes and eligible multifamily rental properties. The income limits for such services vary by fund source. HomeWise Program forgivable grants are available, up to $10,000, for lead-based paint abatement if required in a rehabilitation project. Grant terms require full repayment if the home is sold within 5 years and provide for forgiveness after 5 years.
