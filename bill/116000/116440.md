 A. Landscaping requirements.

 1. The Director shall promulgate rules to foster the long-term health, viability, and coverage of plantings. The rules shall address, at a minimum, the type and size of plants, spacing of plants, use of drought-tolerant plants, and access to light and air for plants. All landscaping provided to meet the requirements of this section shall comply with these rules. ~~Standards. All landscaping provided to meet requirements under this section must meet standards promulgated by the Director to provide for the long- term health, viability and coverage of plantings. The Director may promulgate standards relating to matters including, but not limited to, the type and size of plants, number of plants, concentration of plants, depths of soil, use of low water use plants and access to light and air for plants.~~

 2. ~~Green Area Factor Requirement.~~ Landscaping that achieves a ~~g~~Green ~~f~~Factor score of .30 or greater, pursuant to the procedures set forth in Section 23.86.019, is required for any lot with:

 a. ~~any new structure~~development containing more than four ~~(4)~~new dwelling units; or

c. any ~~new~~ parking lot containing more than ~~twenty (20)~~20 new parking spaces for automobiles.

~~3. Green Area Factor Calculation. The green area factor score for a lot is determined as follows:~~a. Multiply the square feet, or equivalent square

 footage where applicable, of each of the existing and proposed elements listed in Chart A of this Section by the green area multiplier shown for that element, according to the following provisions:

 (1) If multiple elements listed on Chart A occupy an area (for example, groundcover under a tree), the full square footage or equivalent square footage of each element is used to calculate the product for that element.

 (2) Landscaping elements that are provided in the portions of rights-of-way abutting the lot that are between the lot line and the roadway may be included, except that permeable paving in the right-of-way may not be included.

 (3) Elements listed in Chart A that are provided to satisfy any requirements of this chapter may be included.

 (4) For trees and large shrubs, use the equivalent square footage of each tree or shrub according to Chart B of this Section.

 (5) For vegetated walls, use the square footage of the portion of the wall covered by vegetation.

 (6) For all elements other than trees, large shrubs and vegetated walls, square footage is determined by the area of the portion of a horizontal plane that underlies the element.

 b. Add together all the products computed under subsection A3a to determine the total green area factor.

 c. Divide the total green area factor by the lot area to determine the green area factor score.

 Section 11. Section 23.47A.032 of the Seattle Municipal Code, which section was adopted by Ordinance 122311, is amended as follows:

 23.47A.032 Parking location and access~~.~~

 A. Access to parking~~.~~

 1. NC zones. The following rules apply in NC zones, except as provided under 23.47A.032.A.2 and 23.47A.032.D~~may be permitted under subsection C of this section~~:

 a. Access to parking ~~must~~shall be from the alley if the lot abuts an alley improved to the standards of Section 23.53.030.C, or if the Director determines that alley access is feasible and desirable to mitigate parking access impacts.

 b. If ~~the lot does not abut an improved~~ access is not provided from an alley and the lot abuts only one street, access is permitted from the street, and limited to one two-way curb cut.

 c. If ~~the lot does not abut an improved~~ access is not provided from an alley ~~but~~and the lot abuts two or more streets, access ~~to parking must be from the street with the fewest lineal feet of commercially zoned frontage, except as provided in subsection A2b of this Section~~is permitted across one of the side street lot lines as determined through 23.47A.032.C, and curb cuts are permitted pursuant to Section 23.54.030.F.2.a.1).

2. ~~Pedestrian-Designated Zones. T~~In addition to the provisions governing NC zones in 23.47A.032.A.1, t he following rules apply in pedestrian-designated zones, except as may be permitted under subsection 23.47A.032.D~~C of this section~~:

~~a. Access to parking shall be from an alley if the lot abuts an alley improved to the standards of Section 23.53.030C.~~

~~b.~~a. If ~~the lot does not abut an improved~~access is not provided from an alley ~~but~~ and the lot abuts two or more streets, access to parking shall be from a street that is not a principal pedestrian street.~~~~~~c.~~b. If ~~the lot does not abut an improved alley,~~access is not provided from an alley and  the lot abuts only a principal pedestrian street or streets, access is permitted from the principal pedestrian street, and limited to one two-way curb cut.

 3. ~~C1 and C2 zones.~~In C1 and C2 zones, access to off-street parking may be from a street, alley, or both when the lot abuts an alley. However, structures in C zones with residential uses and structures in C zones across the street from residential zones ~~must~~shall meet the requirements for parking access for NC zones as provided in subsection 23.47A.032. A.1.

 B. Location of parking.

 1. ~~NC Zones.~~ The following rules apply in NC zones, except as provided in subsection~~s~~23.47A.032.D ~~subsection B2 of this section or as may be permitted under subsection C of this section~~.

 a. Parking ~~may~~shall not be located between a structure and a street lot line (Exhibit A for 23.47A.032~~A~~.

 b. Within a structure, street-level parking shall be separated from street-level, street-facing facades by another permitted use.~~Parking may not be located inside a structure adjacent to a street-level street-facing facadeaccording to Section 23.47A.005C.~~ This requirement ~~shall~~does not apply to access to parking meeting the standards of subsection 23.47A.032.A ~~1, above~~.

 c. Parking to the side of a structure shall not exceed ~~sixty (60)~~60 feet of ~~lineal~~ street frontage (Exhibit B for 23.47A.032~~B~~.

 2. ~~Pedestrian-designated Zones. The following rules apply i~~In pedestrian designated zones, surface parking is prohibited abutting the street lot line along a principal pedestrian street.

~~a. Parking may not be located between a structure and a street lot line.~~b. Parking may not be located inside a structure at street-levelalong a principal pedestrian street. This requirement shall not apply to access to parking meeting the standards of subsection A2, above.

~~c. Parking may be located at the rear of a structure, or maybe built into or under a structure, or be located within eight hundred (800) feet of the lot with the use to which it is accessory, according to the provisions of Section 23.54.025, Parking covenants.~~~~~~3. ~~C1 and C2 zones.~~ Off-street parking may ~~generally~~ be located anywhere on a lot in C1 and C2 zones~~. However~~, except that structures with residential uses in C zones and structures in C zones across the street from residential zones ~~must~~shall meet the requirements for parking location for NC zones as provided in subsection 23.47A.032.B .1.

C. When a lot fronts on two or more streets, the Director will determine which of the streets will be considered the front lot line, for purposes of this section only. In making a determination, the Director will consider the following criteria:  1. The extent to which each street's pedestrian-oriented character or commercial continuity would be disrupted by curb cuts, driveways or parking adjacent to the street;

 2. The potential for pedestrian and automobile conflicts; and

 3. The relative traffic capacity of each street as an indicator of the street's role as a principal commercial street.

~~C~~D. Exceptions to parking location and access requirements.

 1. Access to off-street parking may be from a street when, due to the relationship of an alley to the street system, use of the alley for parking access would create a significant safety hazard as determined by the Director ~~as a Type I Master Use Permit decision~~.

 2. If a lot borders an unopened right-of-way, the Director may apply the parking access and location requirements as if that street did not border the lot if, after consultation with the Director of Transportation, the Director determines that the street is unlikely to be opened or improved.~~When a lot fronts on two or more streets on which the lineal feet of commercially zoned frontage are equal, the Director will determine the front lot line for the purposes of location of parking and may allow parking between a building and the street. In making a determination, the Director will consider the following criteria:~~a. The extent to which parking along a street would disrupt an established commercial street's pedestrian-oriented character or commercial continuity;

 b. The potential for pedestrian and automobile conflicts;

 c. The relative traffic capacity of a street as an indicator of a street's role as a principal commercial street.

~~~~3. On waterfront lots in the Shoreline District, parking may be located between the structure and the front lot line, if necessary to prevent blockage of view corridors or to keep parking away from the edge of the water as required by the Shoreline Master Program.

E. When an existing building is proposed to be expanded, the Director shall determine the location of parking and access with the goal of minimizing the impact of parking and access along the front lot line.

~~D~~F. ~~Direct access to a loading berth from a street is permitted only when no alley improved to the standards of Section 23.53.030C is available for access.~~Access to a loading berth shall be from the alley if the lot abuts an alley improved to the standards of subsection 23.53.030.C, or if the Director determines that alley access is feasible and desirable to mitigate right-of-way impacts.

~~E~~G. Parking ~~must~~shall be screened according to the provisions of Section 23.47A.016.

~~F~~H. Surface Parking.

 1. Pedestrian access through surface parking areas. Where a pedestrian entrance to one or more general sales and service or major durables retail sales uses greater in the aggregate than 30,000 square feet is oriented to a parking lot, a ~~five (5)~~5- foot-wide pedestrian walkway through the parking lot to the pedestrian entrance ~~must~~shall be provided for each 50 spaces of parking provided.

 2. Surface parking separating the building from the street. Where a pedestrian entrance to one or more general sales and service or major durables retail sales uses greater in the aggregate than 30,000 square feet is oriented to a surface parking area separating a building from a street, at least one ~~five (5)~~ 5-foot-wide pedestrian walkway from the street to the pedestrian entrance ~~must~~shall be provided.

A facility shall be considered to be "in use" during the period beginning three (((3))) hours before an event is scheduled to begin and ending one (((1))) hour after a scheduled event is expected to end. For sports events of variable or uncertain duration, the expected event length shall be the average length of the events of the same type for which the most recent data are available, provided it is within the past five (((5))) years. During an inaugural season, or for nonrecurring events, the best available good faith estimate of event duration will be used. A facility will not be deemed to be "in use" by virtue of the fact that administrative or maintenance personnel are present. The Director may reduce the required parking for any event when projected attendance for a spectator sports facility is certified to be ((fifty (50))) 50 percent or less of the facility's seating capacity, to an amount not less than that required for the certified projected attendance, at the rate of one (((1))) space for each ten (((10))) fixed seats of certified projected attendance. An application for reduction and the certification shall be submitted to the Director at least ((fifteen (15))) 15 days prior to the event. When the event is one of a series of similar events, such certification may be submitted for the entire series ((fifteen (15))) 15 days prior to the first event in the series. If the Director finds that a certification of projected attendance of ((fifty (50))) 50 percent or less of the seating capacity is based on satisfactory evidence such as past attendance at similar events or advance ticket sales, the Director shall, within ((fifteen (15))) 15 days of such submittal, notify the facility operator that a reduced parking requirement has been approved, with any conditions deemed appropriate by the Director to ensure adequacy of parking if expected attendance should change. The parking requirement reduction may be applied for only if the goals of the facility's Transportation Management Plan are otherwise being met. The Director may revoke or modify a parking requirement reduction approval during a series, if projected attendance is exceeded.

 * * *

 F. Reductions to Minimum Parking Requirements ~~for Nonresidential Uses~~.

 1. Reductions to minimum parking requirements permitted by this subsection will be calculated from the minimum parking requirements in Section 23.54.015. Total reductions to required parking as provided in this subsection may not exceed ~~forty (40)~~40 percent.

 2. Transit Reduction.

 a. In NC zones and C zones, except pedestrian- designated zones, and in the Seattle Mixed (SM) zone, except on Class 1 Pedestrian Streets, the minimum parking requirement for a nonresidential use, except institutions, may be reduced by ~~twenty (20)~~20 percent when the use is located within ~~eight hundred (800)~~800 feet of a street with midday transit service headways of ~~fifteen (15)~~15 minutes or less in each direction. This distance will be the walking distance measured from the nearest bus stop to the property line of the lot containing the use.
