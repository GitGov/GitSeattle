 4.~~In addition to the authority provided in subsection B2 above, the Department, upon approval of each such contract by Council resolution, also shall have the authority through April 1, 2002, to enter into longer- term power sales, purchase or exchange contracts with any city or town, public utility district, governmental agency, municipal corporation, mutual association, broker, agent, or with any person, firm, or corporation, or any other member of the general public, either inside or outside its service area.
