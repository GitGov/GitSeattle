 AN ORDINANCE relating to the Department of Parks and Recreation authorizing the Superintendent of Parks and Recreation to negotiate, execute, grant and convey easement rights over, under and across a portion of Fauntleroy Park for the purposes of installing, repairing, maintaining and reconstructing an existing retaining wall to repair and control landslide activity, and to accept payment and reimbursement therefor.

 WHEREAS, in January, 1997, a landslide occurred affecting Fauntleroy Park and two private residential properties adjacent to the north boundary of Fauntleroy Park; and

 WHEREAS, a geotechnical investigation of the affected properties determined that a retaining structure could reduce the likelihood of another landslide, thus benefiting both the private properties and the park property; and

 WHEREAS, in November, 2001, the private property owners applied for and were issued Parks Revocable Use Permit Number 2002-09 allowing installation of a retaining structure, subject to certain conditions and requirements; and

 WHEREAS, the Permit required that the private property owners seek an easement from the City of Seattle, granting permanent rights and continuing responsibility for the retaining structure; and

 WHEREAS, the value of the easement has been determined by an appraisal; and

 WHEREAS, this grant of easement is not a transaction requiring an equivalent parcel in exchange pursuant to Ordinance 118477 (Initiative 42); NOW, THEREFORE,

 BE IT ORDAINED BY THE CITY OF SEATTLE AS FOLLOWS:

 Section 1. As requested by the Superintendent of Parks and Recreation ("Superintendent"), and recommended by the Mayor, the Superintendent is authorized to negotiate, execute, grant and convey a perpetual, non-exclusive easement over, under and across a portion of real property ("Property") located in Fauntleroy Park, legally described as follows:

 RETAINING WALL EASEMENT AGREEMENT

 THIS RETAINING WALL EASEMENT AGREEMENT (the "Easement Agreement") dated _______________, 2008, is made by and between THE CITY OF SEATTLE, a municipal corporation existing under the laws of the State of Washington (the "City"), and JAMES H. GILLINGHAM and ANNE K. GILLINGHAM, husband and wife, and ANNE SPEROS and GEORGE KUETGENS, each as their separate estates, as their interests may appear ("Grantees"), for the benefit and in favor of the Grantees.

 RECITALS

 A. Grantees are the holders of fee title to certain real property described on attached Exhibit A (the "Benefited Land"). The City, acting through its Department of Parks and Recreation ("Parks"), is the holder of fee title to certain real property described on the attached Exhibit B (the "Burdened Land"). The Benefited Land and the Burdened Land are adjacent parcels of property situated within the City of Seattle, King County, Washington and are within a slide-prone area.

 B. Under a REVOCABLE PERMIT TO USE OR OCCUPY PARK PROPERTY (Permit No. 2002-09) dated effective as of April 25, 2002 (the "Revocable Permit"), Parks issued to said Grantees as fee owners of the Benefited Property, a temporary permit to install, repair, maintain and reconstruct a buttress slope stabilization retaining wall upon the Burdened Land for the purpose of controlling slide activity (the "Retaining Wall"), pursuant to City of Seattle Department of Planning and Development (DPD) Project No. 2006588. As contemplated by the Revocable Permit, the Retaining Wall was subsequently installed and surveyed and the fair market value of the easement interest taken by the Retaining Wall was established by independent fee appraisal and paid to the City.

 C. As a condition of the issuance of the Revocable Permit, and as required by Seattle Municipal Code section 15.04.060, Grantees agreed to indemnify, defend and hold the City and its officers, agents and employees harmless from any and all losses, claims, actions, costs, damages and expenses (including attorney's fees and costs) arising out of or resulting from any act, error or omission of the Grantees or any of their agents, subcontractors, employees and invitees in connection with any act or activity authorized by the Revocable Permit. The Revocable Permit provided that the indemnification provisions pertaining to the Retaining Wall contained therein shall survive the term of the Revocable Permit by Grantees' execution of a WAIVER AND INDEMNIFICATION AGREEMENT AND COVENANT TO MAINTAIN RETAINING WALL, of even date, which becomes a part hereof and is attached as Exhibit D (the "Indemnification Agreement").

 D. This Easement Agreement is required under the terms of the Revocable Permit and pertains to the Indemnification Agreement.

 E. The granting of this Easement and execution of this Easement Agreement has been duly authorized by the City by action of the Seattle City Council under Ordinance No. ______________, passed ______________, 2008.

 THEREFORE, the parties agree as follows:

 1. GRANT OF EASEMENT.

 1.1. Retaining Wall Easement. The City hereby grants and conveys to Grantees a perpetual non-exclusive easement for the purposes of installing, repairing, maintaining and reconstructing the existing Retaining Wall for the purpose of controlling slide activity, for the use and benefit of the Benefited Land by Grantees and Grantees' heirs, successors and assigns in interest in the Benefited Property, over, under and across that portion of the Burdened Land which is legally described on attached Exhibit C (the "Easement Area"). A survey (the "Survey") of the Easement Area is recorded under King County Recording Number 20051230900019 and is incorporated herein by reference.

 1.2. Maintenance and Repair Easement. The City further hereby grants and conveys to Grantees a non-exclusive temporary easement over and across that portion of the Burdened Land which lies within ten (10) feet of and adjoins the perimeter of the Easement Area for purposes of undertaking and completing the periodic inspection, repair, maintenance and reconstruction of the Retaining Wall. All such activities shall be at Grantees' expense and in accordance with the Indemnity Agreement and shall be subject to all applicable laws, regulations and ordinances of the City, including any such further building permit or other conditions as may apply to the intended work.

 2. SUCCESSORS AND ASSIGNS. The covenants and conditions contained in this Agreement inure to the benefit of and bind the heirs, successors, executors, administrators and assigns of the parties hereto.

 3. EASEMENT APPURTENANT. This Easement is appurtenant to the Benefited Land and therefore shall run with the land.

 4. SECTION HEADINGS. The marginal headings and paragraph titles to the paragraphs of this Agreement are not a part hereof and shall have no effect on the construction of or interpretation of any part of this Agreement.

 5. EFFECT ON OTHER DOCUMENTS. This Easement supersedes and replaces the Revocable Permit, but not the Indemnity Agreement provision. Both this Easement Agreement and the Indemnity Agreement as set forth herein as Exhibit D shall continue in full force and effect in accordance with their respective terms. Grantees shall maintain a liability insurance policy with the City named as an additional insured for any activity associated with the Retaining Wall.

 IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the City has executed this Easement Agreement as of the date first written above by its duly appointed and authorized officer.
