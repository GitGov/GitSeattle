 AN ORDINANCE relating to the levy of property taxes; fixing the rates and/or amounts of taxes to be levied, and levying the same upon all taxable property, both real and personal, in the City of Seattle, to finance the departments and activities of City government and to provide for the general obligation bond interest and redemption requirements for the year beginning on the first day of January 2010; ratifying and confirming certain prior acts; and by a vote of a majority plus one of the Seattle City Council, finding a substantial need to use, and providing for the use of, 101% as the regular property tax limit factor.

 BE IT ORDAINED BY THE CITY OF SEATTLE AS FOLLOWS:

 Section 1. General Municipal and Firefighters' Pension.

 A. There is levied a tax on all taxable property, both real and personal, within the City of Seattle and subject to taxation under the laws of the State of Washington in the amount of Four Hundred Forty-five Million Seven Hundred Forty-eight Thousand Six Hundred Seventy-four Dollars ($445,748,674), which is calculated as Three Dollars and Sixty cents ($3.60) per thousand dollars of estimated assessed value of such property. This tax is levied for the purpose of raising revenue to finance the various departments and activities of the municipal government of the City of Seattle for the fiscal (calendar) year 2010. The following sentence is provided for information only. This levy has been calculated at the following dollar rates per thousand dollars of assessed value: Three Dollars and Thirty-seven and one-half cents ($3.375) for general municipal purposes as allowed by RCW 84.52.043 (which includes up to Twenty-two and one-half cents ($0.225) for the Firemen's Pension Fund as allowed by RCW 41.16.060); and Twenty-two and one-half cents ($0.225) for general municipal purposes and the Firemen's Pension Fund as allowed by RCW 41.16.060. This levy includes an amount of Sixteen Million Six Hundred Eighty-four Thousand Dollars ($16,684,000) for educational and developmental services in accordance with Ordinance 121529; an amount of Eleven Million Seven Hundred Fifty Thousand Dollars ($11,750,000) for firefighting, life-safety and other emergency response facilities in accordance with Ordinance 121230; an amount of Thirty-seven Million Seven Hundred Sixty Thousand Five Hundred Thirty-two Dollars ($37,760,532), for transportation purposes in accordance with Ordinance 122232; an amount of Twelve Million Five Hundred Thousand Dollars ($12,500,000) for basic infrastructure improvements to the Pike Place Market in accordance with Ordinance 122737; an amount of Twenty-four Million Two Hundred Fifty Thousand Dollars ($24,250,000) for parks purposes in accordance with Ordinance 122749; and an amount of Twenty Million Seven Hundred Fourteen Thousand Two Hundred Eighty-six Dollars ($20,714,286) for low-income housing purposes in accordance with Ordinance 123013.

 B. If the total of the amounts of taxes stated in subsection 1.A, or the total of the tax rate stated in subsection 1.A would be in excess of any maximum allowed by law, then such taxes shall be reduced to the maximum amount allowed. The maximum amount allowed by law includes the maximum amount of regular property taxes approved by vote of the people of the City of Seattle pursuant to RCW 84.55.050. For purposes of this subsection, the maximum amount of regular property taxes is determined by the King County Assessor as follows. First, the Assessor determines the amount of regular City property taxes that could have been levied for collection in 2010 had the voters approved none of the levy lid lift measures submitted pursuant to RCW 84.55.050 and Ordinances 121529, 121230, 122232, 122737, 122749 and 123013. This amount is computed by the Assessor by multiplying the amount of general purpose regular property taxes levied for collection in 2009 by a limit factor. The limit factor is the lesser of 101% or 100% plus the rate of inflation, unless pursuant to RCW 84.55.0101, the Council finds that there is a substantial need to use and approves the use of 101% as the regular property tax limit factor. Second, the Assessor adds the levy for tax refunds authorized by RCW 84.68.040 and RCW 84.55.070; plus the allowance authorized by RCW 84.55.010 for new construction, increases in assessed value due to construction of electric generation wind turbine facilities classified as personal property, improvements to property, and any increase in the assessed value of state-assessed property. Then, to that total amount is added the six dollar amounts set forth in the last sentence of subsection 1.A, authorized for 2010 collection in the approvals given by the voters of the City pursuant to RCW 84.55.050 and those enumerated ordinances.

 Section 2. Pursuant to RCW 84.55.0101, and pursuant to Resolution 31134 adopting the City Council's top budget goals for the 2010 budget, and in order to carry out those budget goals and the 2010-2015 Capital Improvement Program, the City Council finds that there is a substantial need to use and approves the use of 101% as the regular property tax limit factor for regular property taxes to be collected in 2010.

 Section 3. Voter-approved excess taxes for bonds. In addition, a further tax is levied to raise revenue to provide for the interest on and redemption of voter-approved general obligation bonds for the fiscal year 2010 in the amount of Sixteen Million Five Hundred Sixty-eight Thousand Three Hundred Ten Dollars ($16,568,310). This tax is applicable to all taxable property within the City of Seattle.

 Section 4. Severability. The several provisions of this ordinance are declared to be separate and severable and the invalidity of any clause, sentence, paragraph, subdivision, section, subsection, or portion of this ordinance, or the invalidity of the application thereof to any person, property, or circumstance, shall not affect the validity of the remainder of this ordinance or the validity of its application to other persons, property, or circumstances.

 Section 5. Any act pursuant to the authority of this ordinance taken after the passage of this ordinance is ratified and confirmed.

 Section 6. Effective date. This ordinance shall take effect and be in force thirty (30) days from and after its approval by the Mayor, but if not approved and returned by the Mayor within ten (10) days after presentation, it shall take effect as provided by the Seattle Municipal Code Section 1.04.020.
