Where the provisions in Personnel Rule 11 do not conflict with the expressed provisions of this Agreement, the Personnel Rule 11 shall apply and be subject to the grievance procedure as provided for in Article 20.

 1.2.1 Temporary employees who are not in benefits-eligible assignments shall be paid for all hours worked at the first pay step of the hourly rates of pay set forth within the appropriate Appendix covering the classification of work in which he/she is employed; provided, however, at the discretion of the department director, and under the authority of special ordinance allowing same, temporary employees in the job titles covered by this Agreement may be hired in at any one of the steps of the salary range applicable to the title. Temporary employees who are in a benefits-eligible assignment shall receive step increases consistent with Article 4.2.1, 4.2.4 and 4.2.5.

 1.2.2 Premiums Applicable Only to City of Seattle Temporary Employees who are not in benefits-eligible assignments - Each temporary employee shall receive premium pay as hereinafter set forth based upon the corresponding number of cumulative non-overtime hours worked by the temporary employee unless the employee is in a benefits-eligible assignment:

 0001st hour through 0520th hour 5% premium pay

 0521st hour through 1,040th hour 10% premium pay

 1,041st hour through 2,080th hour 15% premium pay (If an employee worked 800 hours or more in the previous twelve [12] months, they shall receive twenty percent [20%] premium pay.)

 2,081st hour + 20% premium pay (If an employee worked eight hundred [800] hours or more in the previous twelve [12] months, they shall receive twenty-five percent [25%] premium pay.)

 The appropriate percentage premium payment shall be applied to all gross earnings.

 1.2.2.1 Once a temporary employee reaches a given premium level, the premium shall not be reduced for that temporary employee as long as the employee continues to work for the City without a voluntary break in service as set forth within Section 1.2.8. Non-overtime hours already worked by an existing temporary employee shall apply in determining the applicable premium rate. In view of the escalating and continuing nature of the premium, the City may require that a temporary employee be available to work for a minimum number of hours or periods of time during the year.

 1.2.2.2 The premium pay in Section 1.2.2 does not include either increased vacation pay due to accrual rate increases or the City's share of any retirement contributions. Any increase in a temporary employee's vacation accrual rate percentage shall be added on to the premium pay percentages for the temporary employee to whom it applies.

 1.2.3 Medical, Dental and Vision Coverage to Temporary Employees Who are not in benefits-eligible positions - - Once a temporary employee has worked at least one thousand forty (1,040) cumulative non-overtime hours and at least eight hundred (800) non-overtime hours or more in the previous twelve (12) months, the employee may within ninety (90) calendar days thereafter elect to participate in the City's medical, dental and vision insurance programs by agreeing to pay the required monthly premium. To participate, the temporary employee must agree to a payroll deduction equal to the amount necessary to pay the monthly health care premiums, or the City, at its discretion, may reduce the premium pay of the employee who chooses this option in an amount equal to the insurance premiums. The temporary employee must continue to work enough hours each month to pay the premiums and maintain eligibility. After meeting the requirements stated in this Section, a temporary employee shall also be allowed to elect this option during any subsequent open enrollment period allowed regular employees. An employee who elects to participate in these insurance programs and fails to make the required payments in a timely fashion shall be dropped from City medical, dental and vision coverage and shall not be able to participate again while employed by the City as temporary unless he or she is converted from receiving premium pay to receiving benefits. If a temporary employee's hours of work are insufficient for their pay to cover the insurance premium, the temporary employee may, on no more than one occasion, pay the difference, or self-pay the insurance premium, for up to three (3) consecutive months.

 1.2.4 Holiday Work For Non-Benefits-Eligible Temporary Employees - A temporary employee who works on any of the specific calendar days designated by the City as paid holidays shall be paid at the rate of one and one-half (1 1/2) times his/her regular straight-time hourly rate of pay for hours worked during his/her scheduled shift. When a specific holiday falls on a weekend day and most regular employees honor the holiday on the preceding Friday or following Monday adjacent to the holiday, the holiday premium pay of one and one-half (1 1/2) times the employee's regular straight-time rate of pay shall apply to those temporary employees who work on the weekend day specified as the holiday.

 1.2.5 Benefits-Eligible Temporary Employee Holiday Pay - A temporary employee shall be compensated at his or her straight-time rate of pay for all officially recognized City holidays that occur subsequent to the employee becoming eligible for fringe benefits, for as long as he or she remains in such eligible assignment.

 1. To qualify for a holiday pay, the employee must be on active pay status the normally scheduled workday before or after the holiday as provided by Section 6.2

 2. Officially recognized City holidays that fall on Saturday shall be observed on the preceding Friday. Officially recognized City holidays that fall on Sunday shall be observed on the following Monday. If the City's observance of a holiday falls on a temporary employee's normal day off, he or she shall be eligible for another day off, with pay during the same workweek.

 3. Temporary employees who work less than 80 hours per pay period shall have their holiday pay pro-rated based on the number of straight-time hours compensated during the preceding pay period.

 4. A temporary employee shall receive two personal holidays immediately upon becoming eligible for fringe benefits, provided he or she has not already received personal holidays in another assignment within the same calendar year.

 5. Personal holidays cannot be carried over from calendar year to calendar year, nor can they be cashed out.

 6. A temporary employee must use any personal holidays before his or her current eligibility for fringe benefits terminates. If a employee requests and is denied the opportunity to use his or her personal holidays during the eligibility assignment, the employing unit must permit him or her to use and be compensated for the holidays immediately following the last day worked in the assignment, prior to termination of the assignment.

 1.2.6 Premium pay set forth within Section 1.2.2 shall be in lieu of the base level of vacation and all other fringe benefits, such as sick leave, holiday pay, funeral leave, military leave, jury duty pay, disability leave, and medical and dental insurance, except as otherwise provided in Sections 1.2.2.2, 1.2.3, and 1.2.4.

 1.2.7 The City may, at any time after ninety (90) calendar days' advance notification to and upon consultation with the affected collective bargaining representatives, provide all fringe benefits covered by the premium pay set forth within Section 1.2.2 to all or some groups (departmental or occupational) of temporary employees to the same extent that they are available to regular employees within the same group, and in such event the premium pay provision in Section 1.2.2 shall no longer be applicable to that particular group of temporary employees. The City, at its discretion, may also after ninety (90) calendar days' advance notification to and upon consultation with the affected collective bargaining representatives, provide paid vacation and/or sick leave benefits to all or some groups (departmental or occupational) of temporary employees to the same extent that they are available to regular employees without providing other fringe benefits, and in such event the premium pay in Section 1.2.2 shall be reduced by a percentage amount equivalent to the value of vacation and/or sick leave benefits. The applicable amount for base-level vacation shall be recognized as four point eight one percent (4.81%), which could be higher dependent upon accrual rate increases. The applicable amount for base-level sick leave shall be four point six percent (4.6%). The City shall not use this option to change to and from premiums and benefits on an occasional basis. The City may also continue to provide benefits in lieu of all or part of the premiums in Section 1.2.2 where it has already been doing so, and it may in such cases reduce the premium paid to the affected employees by the applicable percentage.

 1.2.8 A temporary employee who is assigned to a benefits eligible assignment will receive fringe benefits in-lieu-of premium pay until the assignment is converted or terminated.

 1.2.9 The premium pay provisions set forth within Section 1.2.2 shall apply to cumulative non-overtime hours that occur without a voluntary break in service by the temporary employee. A voluntary break in service shall be defined as quit, resignation, service retirement, or failure to return from an unpaid leave. If the temporary employee has not worked for at least one (1) year (12 months or 26 pay periods), it shall be presumed that the employee's break in service was voluntary.

 1.2.10 The City may work temporary employees beyond one thousand forty (1,040) regular hours within any twelve (12) month period; provided, however, the City shall not use temporary employees to supplant regular positions. The City shall not assign or schedule temporary employees (or fail to do so) solely to avoid accumulation of regular hours that would increase the premium pay provided for in Section 1.2.2 or solely to avoid considering creation of regular positions.

 1.2.10.1 In the event that an interim assignment of a temporary employee to a vacant regular position accrues more than one thousand five hundred (1500) hours or accumulates hours in eighteen (18) or more consecutive pay periods, the City shall notify the union that a labor-management meeting shall take place within two (2) weeks for the purpose of discussing the status of filling the vacant position prior to one (1) year.

 1.2.11 A temporary employee who has worked in excess of five hundred twenty (520) regular hours and who is appointed to a regular position without a voluntary break in service greater than thirty (30) days shall have his/her time worked counted for purposes of salary step placement (where appropriate). In addition, a temporary employee who is in a term-limited assignment shall receive service credit for layoff purposes if the employee is immediately hired (within thirty (30) business days without a break in service) into the same job title and position after the term is completed.

 1.2.12 Temporary employees covered by this Agreement who have worked for the City for one thousand forty (1040) hours without a break in service are eligible to apply to all positions advertised internally.

 1.2.13 A temporary employee who has worked one thousand forty (1040) straight-time hours and is receiving benefits from the City may by mutual agreement be allowed to accrue compensatory time if the work unit in which the temporary employee is assigned has a practice/policy of accruing compensatory time. Scheduling compensatory time shall be by mutual agreement with the supervisor. If the temporary employee does not use his or her accrued compensatory time prior to the termination of the benefits eligible assignment, the compensatory time will be cashed out upon termination of the assignment.

 1.2.14 A temporary employee who receives fringe benefits in-lieu-of premium pay may be eligible for the sick leave transfer program.

 1.2.15 On an annual basis, the City will provide the Union with a copy of the Temporary Employee Utilization Report.

 1.3 The City may establish on-the-job training program(s) in a different classification and/or within another bargaining unit for the purpose of providing individuals an opportunity to compete and potentially move laterally and/or upward into new career fields. Prior to implementation of such a program(s) relative to bargaining unit employees, the City shall discuss the program(s) with the appropriate Union or Unions, and the issue of bargaining unit jurisdiction and/or salary shall be a proper subject for negotiations at that time upon the request of either party.

 1.4 As part of its public responsibility, the City may participate in or establish public employment programs to provide employment and/or training for and/or service to the City by various segments of its citizenry. Such programs may result in individuals performing work for the City that is considered bargaining unit work pursuant to RCW 41.56. Such programs have included and may include youth training and/or employment programs; adult training and or employment programs; vocational rehabilitation programs; work-study and student-intern programs; court-ordered community service programs; programs to employ developmentally disabled or severely, physically disabled persons known as the "special employment program"; volunteer programs; and other programs with similar purposes. Some examples of such programs already in effect include Summer Youth Employment Program (SYEP), Youth Employment Training Program (YETP), Work-Study, Adopt-a-Park, Seattle Conservation Corps, and court-ordered community Service. Individuals working for the City pursuant to such programs shall be exempt from all provisions of this Agreement.

 1.4.1 The City shall have the right to implement new public employment programs or expand its current programs beyond what exists as of the signature date of this Agreement, but where such implementation or expansion involves bargaining unit work and results in a significant departure from existing practice, the City shall give thirty (30) days' advance written notice to the Union of such and upon receipt of a written request from the Union thereafter, the City shall engage in discussions with the Union on concerns raised by the Union. Notwithstanding any provision to the contrary, the expanded use of individuals under such a public employment program that involves the performance of bargaining unit work within the department beyond what has traditionally existed shall not be the cause of (1) a layoff of regular employees covered by this Agreement, or (2) the abrogation of a regular budgeted full-time position covered by this Agreement that recently had been occupied by a regular full-time employee who performed the specific bargaining unit work now being or about to be performed by an individual under one of the City's public employment programs.

 1.5 An employee who is assigned to work out of class from a classification falling under one bargaining unit to another bargaining unit shall remain under the jurisdiction of the initial bargaining unit until such time as he or she is regularly appointed to the position.

ARTICLE 2 -- NON-DISCRIMINATION

 2.1 The City and the Union shall not unlawfully discriminate against any employee by reason of race, creed, age, color, sex, national origin, religious belief, marital status, sexual orientation, gender identity, veteran status, political ideology, ancestry, or the presence of any sensory, mental, or physical handicap unless based on a bona fide occupational qualification reasonably necessary to the operations of the City.

 2.1.1 Wherever words denoting a specific gender are used in this Agreement, they are intended and shall be construed so as to apply equally to either gender.

 2.1.2 Disputes involving this Article must be processed through the appropriate local, state, or federal agency. Such disputes shall not be subject to the grievance procedure contained within this Agreement.

ARTICLE 3 -- UNION MEMBERSHIP AND DUES

 3.1 It shall be a condition of employment that each employee covered by this Agreement who voluntarily is or who voluntarily becomes a member of said Union shall remain a member of same during the term of this Agreement. Any employee hired or permanently assigned into a bargaining unit position on or after signing of this Agreement shall, on or before the thirtieth (30th) day following the beginning of such employment, join the Union or pay an amount equivalent to the regular monthly dues of the Union. Failure by any such employee to apply for and/or maintain such membership or pay an amount equivalent to the regular monthly dues of the Union in accordance with this provision shall constitute cause for discharge of such employee; provided, however, the requirements to apply for Union membership and/or maintain Union membership shall be satisfied by the employee's payment of the regular initiation fee or regular reinitiation fee or the regular dues uniformly required by the Union of its members as a service fee.

 3.1.1 The Union service fee shall be payable under the terms of this Article beginning with the thirty-first (31st) day following the employee's first date of employment or, for temporary employees, commencing with coverage by this Agreement pursuant to Section 1.2. A temporary employee may, in lieu of the Union membership requirements set forth within Section 3.1, pay a Union service fee in an amount equivalent to one and one-half percent (1.5%) of the total gross earnings received by the temporary employee for all hours worked within the bargaining unit each biweekly pay period, commencing with the first day of the pay period beginning after the employee has worked one hundred forty-four (144) hours in the bargaining unit in the calendar year.

 3.1.2 Employees who are determined by the Public Employment Relations Commission to satisfy the religious exemption requirements of RCW 41.56.122 shall contribute an amount equivalent to regular Union dues and initiation fees to a non-religious charity or to another charitable organization mutually agreed upon by the employee affected and the bargaining representative to which such employee would otherwise pay the regular monthly dues.

 3.2 Failure by an employee to abide by the afore-referenced provisions of this Article shall constitute cause for discharge of such employee; provided, however, it shall be the responsibility of the Union to notify the City in writing when it is seeking discharge of an employee for non-compliance with Sections 3.1 or 3.1.1 or 3.1.2 of this Article. When an employee fails to fulfill the Union security obligations set forth within this Article, the Union shall forward a "Request For Discharge Letter" to the affected department head (with copies to the affected employee and the City Director of Labor Relations). Accompanying the Discharge Letter shall be a copy of the letter to the employee from the Union explaining the employee's obligation under Article III, Sections 3.1 or 3.1.1 or 3.1.2.

 3.2.1 The contents of the "Request For Discharge Letter" shall specifically request the discharge of the employee for failure to abide by Sections 3.1 or 3.1.1 or 3.1.2 of Article III, but provide the employee and the City with thirty (30) calendar days' written notification of the Union's intent to initiate discharge action, during which time the employee may make restitution in the amount that is overdue. Upon receipt of the Union's request, the affected department head shall give notice in writing to the employee, with a copy to the Union and the City Director of Labor Relations, that the employee faces discharge upon the request of the Union at the end of the thirty (30) calendar day period noted in the Union's "Request For Discharge Letter" and that the employee has an opportunity before the end of said thirty (30) calendar day period to present to the affected department any information relevant to why the department should not act upon the Union's written request for the employee's discharge.

 3.2.2 In the event the employee has not yet fulfilled the obligation set forth within Sections 3.1 or 3.1.1 or 3.1.2 of this Article within the thirty (30) calendar day period noted in the Request For Discharge Letter, the Union shall thereafter reaffirm in writing to the affected department head, with copies to the affected employee and the Director of Labor Relations, its original written request for discharge of such employee. Unless sufficient legal explanation or reason is presented by the employee why discharge is not appropriate or unless the Union rescinds its request for the discharge the City shall, as soon as possible thereafter, effectuate the discharge of such employee. If the employee has fulfilled the Union security obligation within the thirty (30) calendar day period, the Union shall so notify the affected department head in writing, with a copy to the City Director of Labor Relations and the affected employee. If the Union has reaffirmed its request for discharge, the affected department head shall notify the Union in writing, with a copy to the City Director of Labor Relations and the affected employee, that the Department effectuated the discharge and the specific date such discharge was effectuated, or that the department has not discharged the employee, setting forth the reasons why it has not done so.

 3.3 The City shall deduct from the pay check of each employee who has so authorized it, the regular initiation fee and regular monthly dues uniformly required of members of the Union or the alternative biweekly Union service fees required of temporary employees per Section 3.1.1. The amounts deducted shall be transmitted monthly to the Union on behalf of the employees involved. The Union shall indemnify and save harmless the City against any and all liability arising out of this Article. If an improper deduction is made, the Union shall refund directly to the employee such amount. Authorization by the employee shall be on a form approved by the parties hereto and may be revoked by the employee upon request.

ARTICLE 4 -- CLASSIFICATIONS AND RATES OF PAY

 4.1 The classifications of employees covered under this Agreement and the corresponding rates of pay are set forth within Appendix "A" and "B" attached hereto and made a part of this Agreement.

 4.1.1 Effective December 26, 2007, the base wage rates, as displayed in the Appendices of this Agreement, reflect an increase of 3.8%.

 4.1.2 Effective January 7, 2009, wages will be increased by 100% of the annual average growth rate of the bi-monthly Seattle-Tacoma- Bremerton Area Consumer Price Index for Urban Wage Earners and Clerical Workers (CPI-W) for the period June 2007 through June 2008 to the period June 2008 through June 2009.

 4.1.3 Effective January 6, 2010, wages will be increased by 100% of the annual average growth rate of the bi-monthly Seattle-Tacoma- Bremerton Area Consumer Price Index for Urban Wage Earners and Clerical Workers (CPI-W) for the period August 2004 through June 2005 to the period August 2005 through June 2006.

 4.1.4 For 2006 and 2007, the percentage increases shall be at least two percent (2%) and not more than seven percent (7%).

4.1.5 The base wage rates referenced above shall be calculated by applying the appropriate percentage increase to base hourly rates or as otherwise provided for herein.

 4.1.6 In the event the "Consumer Price Index" becomes unavailable for purposes of computing any one of the afore-referenced increases, the parties shall jointly request the Bureau of Labor Statistics to provide a comparable index for purposes of computing such increase and if that is not satisfactory, the parties shall promptly undertake negotiations solely with respect to agreeing upon a substitute formula for determining a comparable adjustment.

 4.2 An employee, upon first appointment or assignment shall receive the minimum rate of the salary range fixed for the position as set forth within Appendix "A" and Appendix "B" attached hereto; provided however, appointment may be at a higher step at the discretion of the department director, as allowed by ordinance.

 4.2.1 An employee shall be granted the first automatic step increase in salary rate upon completion of six (6) months of "actual service" when hired at the first step of the salary range, and succeeding automatic step increases shall be granted after twelve (12) months of "actual service" from the date of eligibility for the last step increase to the maximum of the range. Actual service for purposes of this Section shall be defined in terms of one month's service for each month of full-time employment, including paid absences. This provision shall not apply to temporary employees prior to regular appointment, except as otherwise provided for in Section 1.2.10 and except that step increments in the out-of-class title shall be authorized when a step increase in the primary title reduces the pay differential to less than what the promotion rule permits, provided that such increment shall not exceed the top step of the higher salary range. Further, when an employee is assigned to perform out- of-class duties in the same title for a total of twelve (12) months (each 2088 hours) of actual service, he/she will receive one-step increment in the higher-paid title; provided that he/she has not received a step increment in the out-of-class title based on changes to the primary pay rate within the previous twelve (12) months, and that such increment does not exceed the top step of the higher salary range. However, hours worked out-of-class, that were properly paid per Article 5.9 of this Agreement, shall apply toward salary step placement if the employee's position is reclassified to the same title as the out-of-class assignment within twelve (12) months of the end of such assignment.

 4.2.2 For employees assigned salary steps other than the beginning step of the salary range, subsequent salary increases within the salary range shall be granted after twelve (12) months of actual service from the appointment or increase, then at succeeding twelve (12) month intervals to the maximum of the salary range established for the class.

 4.2.3 In determining actual service for advancement in salary step, absence due to sickness or injury for which the employee does not receive compensation may at the discretion of the City be credited at the rate of thirty (30) calendar days per year. Unpaid absences due to other causes may, at the discretion of the City, be credited at the rate of fifteen (15) calendar days per year. For the purposes of this Section, time lost by reason of disability for which an employee is compensated by Industrial Insurance or Charter disability provisions shall not be considered absence. An employee who returns after layoff, or who is reduced in rank to a position in the same or another department, may be given credit for such prior service.

 4.2.3 Any increase in salary based on service shall become effective upon the first day immediately following completion of the applicable period of service.

 4.2.5 Changes in Incumbent Status Transfers - An employee transferred to another position in the same class or having an identical salary range shall continue to be compensated at the same rate of pay until the combined service requirement is fulfilled for a step increase and shall thereafter receive step increases as provided in Section 4.2.1.

 4.2.6 Promotions - An employee appointed to a position in a class having a higher maximum salary shall be placed at the step in the new salary range which provides an increase closest to but not less than one salary step over the most recent step received in the previous salary range immediately preceding the promotion, not to exceed the maximum step of the new salary range; and provided further, that this provision shall apply only to appointments of employees from regular full-time positions and shall not apply to appointments from positions designated as "intermittent" or "as needed". However, hours worked out-of-class shall apply toward salary step placement if the employee is appointed to the same title as the out-of-class assignment within twelve (12) months of the end of such assignment.

 4.2.7 An employee demoted because of inability to meet established performance standards from a regular full-time or part-time position to a position in a class having a lower salary range shall be paid the salary step in the lower range determined as follows:

 A. If the rate of pay received in the higher class is above the maximum salary for the lower class, the employee shall receive the maximum salary of the lower range.

 B. If the rate of pay received in the higher class is within the salary range for the lower class, the employee shall receive that salary rate for the lower class which, without increase, is nearest to the salary rate to which such employee was entitled in the higher class; provided however, the employee shall receive not less than the minimum salary of the lower range.

 4.2.8 An employee reduced because of organizational change or reduction in force from a regular full-time or part-time position to a position in a class having a lower salary range shall be paid the salary rate of the lower range which is nearest to the salary rate to which he/she was entitled in his/her former position without reduction; provided however, such salary shall in no event exceed the maximum salary of the lower range. If an employee who has completed twenty-five (25) years of City service and who within five (5) years of a reduction in lieu of layoff to a position in a class having a lower salary range, such employee shall receive the salary he/she was receiving prior to such second reduction as an "incumbent" for so long as he/she remains in such position or until the regular salary for the lower class exceeds the "incumbent" rate of pay.

 4.2.9 When a position is reclassified by ordinance to a new or different class having a different salary range, the employee occupying the position immediately prior to and at the time of reclassification shall receive the salary rate which shall be determined in the same manner as for a promotion; provided however, if the employee's salary prior to reclassification is higher than the maximum salary of the range for such new or different class, he/she shall continue to receive such higher salary as an "incumbent" for so long as he/she remains in position or until the regular salary for the classification exceeds the "incumbent" rate of pay.

4.2.10 Correction of Payroll Errors - In the event it is determined there has been an error in an employee's paycheck, an underpayment shall be corrected within two pay periods; and, upon written notice, an overpayment shall be corrected as follows:

 A. If the overpayment involved only one paycheck;

 1. By payroll deductions spread over two pay periods; or

 2. By payments from the employee spread over two pay periods.

 B. If the overpayment involved multiple paychecks, by a repayment schedule through payroll deduction not to exceed twenty-six (26) pay periods in duration, with a minimum payroll deduction of not less than twenty-five dollars ($25) per pay period.

 C. If an employee separates from the City service before an overpayment is repaid, any remaining amount due the City will be deducted from his/her final paycheck(s).

 D. By other means as may be mutually agreed between the City and the employee. The union representative may participate in this process at the request of the involved employee. All parties will communicate/cooperate in resolving these issues.

ARTICLE 5 -- HOURS OF WORK AND OVERTIME

 5.1 For all hours worked in excess of forty (40) in a work week, an employee shall be paid at a rate one and one-half (1 1/2) times the base hourly rate of his/her job title. The seven-day work week shall be defined as beginning on Wednesday and ending at midnight seven days later on Tuesday. Other work weeks of seven consecutive twenty-four (24) hour periods may be defined to accommodate specified schedules, but must be defined as such in writing to the employee. There shall be two (2) consecutive days off in a row for regular fulltime employees unless mutually agreed upon by both the employee and the supervisor.

 5.1.1 Meal Period - Employees scheduled to work at least a six (6) hour shift shall receive a meal period that shall normally commence no less than two (2) hours nor more than five (5) hours from the beginning of the employee's regular shift or when he/she is called in to work on his/her regular day off. The meal period shall be no less than one-half (1/2) hour nor more than one (1) hour in duration and shall be without compensation.

 For a shift of six (6) hours, upon request of an employee and agreement by the supervisor, the shift may be scheduled without a meal period.

 Should an employee be required to work through the scheduled meal period and unable to reschedule the meal period some other time during the shift, all hours worked shall be compensated. In no event will meal periods be scheduled at the end of a shift.

 5.1.2 Rest Breaks - Employees scheduled to work at least a seven (7) hour shift shall receive a fifteen (15) minute rest break during the first four (4) hour period of their workday and a second fifteen (15) minute rest break during the second four (4) hour period in their workday. Employees shall be compensated at their prevailing wage rate for time spent while on rest breaks.

 Employees scheduled to work at least a four (4) hour, but less than seven (7) hour shift shall receive one fifteen (15) minute rest break during the shift if no meal period as provided for in 5.1.1 is scheduled to be taken.

 5.1.3 Where work conditions require continuous staffing throughout a work shift for seven (7) consecutive days or more, the City may, in lieu of the meal period and rest periods set forth within Sections 5.1.1 and 5.1.2, provide a working meal period and working rest periods during working hours without a loss in pay so that such periods do not interfere with ongoing work requirements.

 5.2 Nothing herein shall be construed to guarantee any employee a number of hours of work.

 5.3 Meal Reimbursement - When an employee is specifically directed by the City to work two (2) hours or longer at the end of his/her normal work shift of at least eight (8) hours, or work two (2) hours or longer at the end of his/her work shift of at least eight (8) hours when he/she is called in to work on his/her regular day off, or otherwise works under circumstances for which meal reimbursement is authorized per Ordinance 111768, and the employee actually purchases a reasonably priced meal away from his place of residence as a result of such additional hours of work, the employee shall be reimbursed for the "reasonable cost" of such meal in accordance with Seattle Municipal Code (SMC) 4.20.325. In order to receive reimbursement, the employee must furnish the City with a dated original itemized receipt from the establishment indicating the time of the meal no later than forty-eight (48) hours from the beginning of his/her next regular shift; otherwise, the employee shall be paid a maximum of ten dollars ($10.00) in lieu of reimbursement for the meal.

 5.3.1 To receive reimbursement for a meal under this provision, the following rules shall be adhered to:

 A. Said meal must be eaten within two (2) hours after completion of the overtime work. Meals shall not be saved, consumed, and claimed at some later date.

 B. In determining "reasonable cost" the following shall also be considered:

 1. The time period during which the overtime is worked;

 2. The availability of reasonably priced eating establishments at that time.

 C. The City shall not reimburse for the cost of alcoholic beverages.

 5.3.2 In lieu of any meal compensation as set forth within this Section, the City may, at its discretion, provide a meal.

 5.3.3 Meal reimbursement while on Travel Status. An employee shall be reimbursed for meals while on travel status at the federal per diem rate. An employee will not be required to submit receipts for meals and may retain any unspent portion of an advance cash allowance for meals.

 5.4 Compensatory Time off in Lieu of Overtime Pay

 A. Compensation for overtime work, by mutual agreement of the department and the employee, may be in compensatory time off in an amount equal to one and one-half (1 1/2) times the number of hours worked.

 B. Earned compensatory time may be scheduled off by mutual agreement of the employee and his/her supervisor.

 C. The department will develop a policy to determine the maximum amount of compensatory time that may be accumulated. Such policy may also set a date or time period by which compensatory time will be used and if not used that it will be paid for at the prescribed rate.

 5.5 Notwithstanding the other Sections of this Article, the department may, following consultation and agreement with the Union, implement a four (4) day, forty (40) hour work week. It will be clearly established whether an alternative work schedule is applicable for a temporary employee.

 5.5.1 For employees who work a four (4) day, forty (40) hour work week or other alternative work schedule, the following shall apply:

 If a holiday is observed on a Saturday or on a Friday that is the normal day off, the holiday will be taken on the last normal workday. If a holiday is observed on a Monday that is the normal day off or on a Sunday, the holiday will be taken on the next normal workday. This schedule will be followed unless the employee and his/her supervisor determine that some other day will be taken off for the holiday; provided, however, that in such case the holiday time must be used no later than the end of the following pay period. If the holiday falls on a Tuesday, Wednesday or Thursday that is the employee's normal scheduled day off, the holiday must be scheduled off no later than the end of the following pay period.

 5.5.2 Employees, including those on alternate work schedules, shall receive 8 hours pay per holiday (except as identified in 6.1.2. and 6.2.

 Employees working an alternate work schedule during a holiday work week are permitted to make scheduling or pay status adjustments as follows:

 1. Employees may revert back to a 5-day/40 hour work week, in which the holiday falls, if available.

 2. Employees may use vacation or compensatory time to supplement the 8-hour holiday pay to achieve full pay for the work week without making other scheduling adjustments, or at the employees' discretion, to be unpaid.

 3. By mutual agreement, pre-arranged between the employee and his or her supervisor, employees may work beyond their normally scheduled workday hours to make up holiday hours. These holiday make-up hours will not be counted as overtime and must be worked during the work week in which the holiday fails. In the event that a request for a modified holiday work week schedule cannot be accommodated, such denial shall not be arbitrary or capricious.

 NOTE: Past practice with regard to holiday pay for employees on alternate work assignments consistent with the 1991 directive on holiday pay will continue.

 5.6 Work Outside of Classification - Work out of class is a management tool, the purpose of which is to complete essential public services whenever an employee is assigned by proper authority to perform the normal, ongoing duties of and accept responsibility of a position. When the duties of the higher paid position are clearly outside the scope of an employee's regular classification for a period of three (3) consecutively scheduled work hours or longer, he/she shall be paid at the out-of-class salary rate while performing such duties and accepting such responsibility. The out-of-class rate shall be determined in the same manner as for a promotion. "Proper authority" shall be a supervisory employee in the line of organization least at the level of Recreation Coordinator, manager, or director directly above the position that is being filled out of class who has budget management authority of the work unit. The City shall have the sole authority to direct its supervisors as to when to assign employees to a higher classification. Employees must meet the minimum qualifications of the higher class and must have demonstrated or be able to demonstrate their ability to perform the duties of the class. (If an employee is mistakenly assigned out-of-class who does not meet the above qualifications, the City will stop the practice immediately once discovered and will see that the out-of-class is paid for work already performed.) The City may work employees out of class across bargaining unit jurisdictions for a period not to exceed six (6) continuous months for any position. The six (6) month period may be exceeded under the following circumstances: (1) when a hiring freeze exists and vacancies cannot be filled; (2) extended industrial or off-the-job injury or disability; (3) when a position is scheduled for abrogation; or (4) a position is encumbered (an assignment in lieu of layoff). When such circumstances require that an out-of-class assignment be extended beyond six (6) months for any position, the City shall notify the Union that represents the employee who is so assigned and/or the body of work that is being performed on an out- of-class basis. After nine (9) months, the Union that represents the body of work being performed out of class must concur with any additional extension of the assignment. The Union that represents the body of work will consider all requests on a good-faith basis.

 5.6.1 The practice of no out-of-class pay for paid leave will continue.

 5.6.2 Effective January 06, 1999, Recreation Attendants, when assigned the monitoring of facilities in the absence of a higher- level supervisor for three (3) consecutive hours or more shall be paid an additional hourly premium pay of one dollar ($1.00) per hour while so assigned.

 5.6.3 An employee may be temporarily assigned to perform the duties of a lower classification without a reduction in pay. When employees voluntarily apply for and voluntarily accept a position in a lower-level classification, they shall receive the salary rate for the lower class, which, without increase, is nearest to the salary rate to which such employee was entitled in the higher class. For such temporary period, the employee shall continue to pay dues to the Union of the higher class. The overtime provisions applicable are those of the contract covering the bargaining unit position the employee previously or normally holds. At management's discretion, an employee may be temporarily assigned the duties of a lower-level class or the duties of a class with the same pay rate range as his/her primary class, across Union jurisdictional lines, with no change to his or her regular pay rate. Out-of-class provisions related to threshold for payment, salary step placement, service credit for salary step placement, and payment for absences do not apply in these instances.

 5.6.4 Out-of-class work shall be formally assigned in advance of the out-of-class opportunity created in normal operating conditions. Where the work is not authorized in advance, it is the responsibility of the proper authority to determine immediately how to accomplish the duties that would otherwise constitute an out-of-class assignment. Any employee may request that this determination be made. The employee will not carry out any duty of the higher-level position when such duty is not also a duty of his or her own classification, if the employee is not formally assigned to perform the duties on an out-of-class basis.

 5.6.5 No employee may assume the duties of the higher-paid position without being formally assigned to do so except in a bona fide emergency. When an employee has assumed an out-of-class role in a bona fide emergency, the individual may apply to his or her department director for retroactive payment of out-of-class pay. The decision of the department director as to whether the duties were performed and whether performance thereof was appropriate shall be final.

 5.6.6 The department shall make a reasonable effort to accommodate employees who have an off-the-job injury or illness with light-duty work if such work is available.

 5.6.7 An employee who is temporarily unable to perform the regular duties of his/her classification due to an off-the-job injury or illness may opt to perform work within a lower-paying classification dependent upon the availability of such work and subject to the approval of the City. The involved employee shall receive the salary rate for the lower class, which, without increase, is nearest to the salary rate to which such employee was entitled in the higher class.

 5.7 A regular employee who is scheduled to work not less than four (4) hours of his/her regular work shift during the evening (swing) shift or night (graveyard) shift, shall receive the following shift premiums for all scheduled hours worked during such shift:

 Swing Shift Graveyard Shift $0.65 per hour $0.90 per hour

 The above swing shift differential shall be due for a ten-hour shift beginning at 2:00 p.m., or later.

 5.7.1 The above shift premium shall apply to time worked as opposed to time off with pay; and therefore, for example, the premium shall not apply to sick leave, vacation, holiday pay, funeral leave, or other paid leave benefit. Employees who work one of the shifts for which a premium is paid and who are required to work overtime, shall have the shift premium included as part of the base hourly rate for purposes of computing the overtime rate pursuant to the requirements of the Fair Labor Standards Act.

 5.7.2 The swing shift period shall encompass the hours from 4:00 p.m. to midnight. The graveyard shift period shall encompass the hours from midnight to 8:00 a.m.

 5.8 Stand-by Time for Overnights - Upon management approval when staff members show up to go on an overnight, they will get paid either regular time, overtime or standby pay excluding meal breaks until they leave to go home after the program ends. Each employee will review each program with their Supervisor to agree on pay parameters and discuss them prior to the overnight event.

 5.8.1 Employees working overnights should be given breakfast, lunch, and dinner breaks, up to one hour each in length.

 5.8.2 Employees who are placed on Standby Duty by the City shall be paid at the rate of ten percent (10%) of the employee's straight-time hourly rate of pay.

ARTICLE 6 -- HOLIDAYS

 6.1 The following days, or days in lieu thereof, shall be recognized as paid holidays:

 New Year's Day January 1 Martin Luther King, Jr.'s Birthday 3rd Monday in January Presidents' Day 3rd Monday in February Memorial Day Last Monday in May Independence Day July 4 Labor Day 1st Monday in September Veterans' Day November 11 Thanksgiving Day 4th Thursday in November Day after Thanksgiving Day Day after Thanksgiving Day Christmas Day December 25

 6.1.2 Whenever any paid holiday falls upon a Sunday, the following Monday shall be recognized as the paid holiday. Whenever any paid holiday falls upon a Saturday, the preceding Friday shall be recognized as the paid holiday; provided, however, paid holidays falling on Saturday or Sunday shall be recognized and paid pursuant to Section 6.4 on those actual days (Saturday or Sunday) for employees who are regularly scheduled to work those days. Payment pursuant to Section 6.4 shall be made only once per affected employee for any one holiday.

 6.1.3 A permanent part-time employee shall receive paid holiday time off (or paid time off in lieu thereof) based upon straight-time hours compensated during the pay period immediately prior to the pay period in which the holiday falls. The amount of paid holiday time off for which the part-time employee is eligible shall be in proportion to the holiday time off provided for full-time employees. For example, a full-time employee working eighty (80) hours per pay period would be eligible for eight (8) hours' off with pay on a holiday, while a part-time employee who works forty (40) hours during the pay period preceding the holiday would be eligible for four (4) hours' off with pay.

 6.2 To qualify for holiday pay, City employees shall have been on pay status their normal workday before or their normal workday following the holiday; provided, however, employees returning from non-pay leave who start work the day after a holiday shall not be entitled to pay for the holiday preceding their first day of work.

 6.3. The Personal Holiday shall be used during the calendar year as a regular holiday. Use of the Personal Holiday shall be requested in advance. When the Personal Holiday has been approved in advance and is later canceled by the City with less than a thirty (30) day advance notice, the employee shall have the option of rescheduling the day or receiving holiday premium pay pursuant to Section 6.4 for all time worked on the originally scheduled Personal Holiday.

 6.4 An employee who has been given at least forty-eight (48) hours' advance notice and who is required to work on a holiday shall be paid for the holiday at his/her regular straight-time hourly rate of pay and, in addition, he/she shall receive one and one-half (1 1/2) times his/her regular straight-time hourly rate of pay for those hours worked on the holiday; or by mutual agreement between the affected employee and the City, the employee may receive one and one- half (1 1/2) times those hours worked in the form of compensatory time off to be taken at another mutually agreed upon date.

 6.5 In the event an employee is required to work without having been given at least a forty-eight (48) hours' advance notification on a holiday he/she normally would have off with pay, said employee shall be paid for the holiday at his/her regular straight-time hourly rate of pay and, in addition, he/she shall receive two (2) times his/her regular straight-time hourly rate of pay for those hours worked on the holiday; or by mutual agreement between the affected employee and the department, the employee may receive two (2) times those hours worked in the form of compensatory time off to be taken at another mutually agreed upon date.

ARTICLE 7 -- ANNUAL VACATIONS

 7.1 Annual vacations with pay shall be granted to eligible employees computed at the rate shown in Section 7.3 for each hour on regular pay status as shown on the payroll, but not to exceed eighty (80) hours per pay period.

 7.2 "Regular pay status" is defined as regular straight-time hours of work plus paid time off such as vacation time, holiday time off, compensatory time, and sick leave. At the discretion of the City, up to one hundred sixty (160) hours per calendar year of unpaid leave of absence may be included as service for purposes of accruing vacation. Time lost by reasons of disability for which an employee is compensated by Industrial Insurance or Charter Disability provisions shall not be considered absence. An employee who returns after layoff shall be given credit for such prior service.

 7.3 The vacation accrual rate shall be determined in accordance with the rates set forth in Column No. 1. Column No. 2 depicts the corresponding equivalent annual vacation for a regular full-time employee. Column No. 3 depicts the maximum number of vacation hours that can be accrued and accumulated by an employee at any time.

 7.4 An employee who is eligible for vacation benefits shall accrue vacation from the date of entering City service or the date upon which he/she becomes eligible and may accumulate a vacation balance which shall never exceed at any time two (2) times the number of annual vacation hours for which the employee is currently eligible. Accrual and accumulation of vacation time shall cease at the time an employee's vacation balance reaches the maximum balance allowed and shall not resume until the employee's vacation balance is below the maximum allowed.

 7.5 Employees may, with department approval, use accumulated vacation with pay after completing one thousand forty (1,040) hours on regular pay status.

 7.6 In the event that the City cancels an employee's already scheduled and approved vacation, leaving no time to reschedule such vacation before the employee's maximum balance will be reached, the employee's vacation balance will be permitted to exceed the allowable maximum and the employee shall continue to accrue vacation for a period of up to three (3) months if such exception is approved by both the department head and the Personnel Director in order to allow rescheduling of the employee's vacation. In such cases the department head shall provide the Personnel Director with the circumstances and reasons leading to the need for such an extension. No extension of this grace period shall be allowed.

 7.7 The minimum vacation allowance to be taken by an employee shall be one-half (1/2) of a day, or at the discretion of the department head, such lesser amount as may be approved by the department head.

 7.8 An employee who separates from City service for any reason after more than six (6) months' service shall be paid in a lump-sum for any unused vacation he/she has accrued.

 7.9 Upon the death of an employee in active service, pay shall be allowed for any vacation earned and not taken prior to the death of such employee.

 7.10 Where an employee has exhausted his/her sick leave balance, the employee may use vacation for further leave for medical reasons subject to verification by the employee's medical care provider. Employees who are called to active military service or who respond to requests for assistance from Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) may, at their option, use accrued vacation in conjunction with a leave of absence.

 7.11 The department head shall arrange vacation time for employees on such schedules as will least interfere with the functions of the department, but which accommodate the desires of the employee to the greatest degree feasible.

ARTICLE 8 -- SICK LEAVE, FUNERAL LEAVE, AND EMERGENCY LEAVE

 8.1 Sick Leave - Regular employees shall accumulate sick leave credit at the rate of .046 hours for each hour on regular pay status as shown on the payroll, but not more than forty (40) hours per week. New employees entering City service shall not be entitled to sick leave with pay during the first thirty (30) days of employment but shall accumulate sick leave credits during such thirty (30) day period. Sick leave credit may be used for bona fide cases of:

 A. Illness or injury that prevents the employee from performing his/her regular duties;

 B. Disability of the employee due to pregnancy and/or childbirth;

 C. Medical or dental appointments for the employee;

 D. Care of family members as required of the City by state law and/or as defined and provided for by City of Seattle ordinance, which may be repealed in whole or in part by an initiative, in which case the parties shall renegotiate this provision in accordance with the terms of Article 21.

 8.1.1 Abuse of sick leave shall be grounds for suspension or dismissal.

 8.1.2 Unlimited sick leave credit may be accumulated.

 8.1.3 Upon retirement, twenty-five percent (25%) of an employee's unused sick leave credit accumulation can be applied to the payment of health care premiums or to a cash payment at the straight-time rate of pay of such employee in effect on the day prior to his retirement.

 8.1.3.1 Cash payments of unused sick leave may be deferred for a period of one (1) year or less, providing the employee notifies the Department Personnel Office of his/her desires at the time of retirement. Request for deferred cash payments of unused sick leave shall be made in writing.

 8.1.4 Upon the death of an employee, either by accident or natural causes, twenty-five percent (25%) of such employee's accumulated sick leave credits shall be paid to his/her designated beneficiary.

 8.1.5 Change in position or transfer to another City department shall not result in a loss of accumulated sick leave. An employee reinstated or reemployed within one (1) year in the same or another department after termination of service, except after dismissal for cause, resignation, or quitting, shall be credited with all unused sick leave accumulated prior to such termination.

 8.1.6 Compensation for the first four (4) consecutive workdays of absence shall be paid upon approval of the Personnel Director or his/her designee. In order to receive compensation for such absence, employees shall make themselves available for such reasonable investigation, medical or otherwise, as the Personnel Director or his/her designee shall see fit to have made. Compensation for such absences beyond four (4) continuous days shall be paid only after approval of the Personnel Director or his designee of a request from the employee supported by a report of the employee's physician. The employee shall provide himself/herself with such medical treatment or take such other reasonable precautions as necessary to hasten recovery and provide for an early return to duty.

 8.1.7 Conditions Not Covered - Employees shall not be eligible for sick leave when:

 8.1.8 Prerequisites for Payment - The following applicable requirements shall be fulfilled in order to establish an employee's eligibility for sick leave benefits.

 8.1.8.1 Prompt Notification - The employee shall promptly notify the immediate supervisor, by telephone or otherwise, on the first day off due to illness and each day thereafter unless advised otherwise by the immediate supervisor. For those absences of more than one day, notification on his/her first day off with an expected date of return shall suffice. The employee shall notify the immediate supervisor as far as possible in advance of the scheduled time to report for work, particularly where a relief replacement is necessary when the employee is absent.

 8.1.8.2 Notification While on Paid Vacation or Compensatory Time Off - If an employee is injured or is taken ill while on paid vacation or compensatory time off, he/she shall notify his/her department on the first day of disability, however, if it is physically impossible to give the required notice on the first day, notice shall be sent as soon as possible and shall be accompanied by an acceptable showing of reasons for the delay. A doctor's statement or other acceptable proof of illness or disability, while on vacation or compensatory time off, must be presented regardless of the number of days involved.

 8.1.8.3 Filing Application - Unless there are extenuating circumstances, the employee shall submit the required application for sick leave pay within sixteen (16) working hours after his/her return to duty. However, if he/she is absent because of illness or injury for more than eighty (80) working hours, he/she shall then file an application for an indefinite period of time. The necessary forms shall be available to the employee through his/her department supervisor.

 8.1.8.4 Claims to Be in 15 Minute Increments - Sick leave shall be claimed in 15 minute increments to the nearest full 15 minute increment, a fraction of less than 8 minutes being disregarded. Separate portions of an absence interrupted by a return to work shall be claimed on separate application forms.

 8.1.8.5 Limitations of Claims - All sick leave claims shall be limited to the actual amount of time lost due to illness or disability. The total amount of sick leave claimed in any pay period by an employee shall not exceed the employee's sick leave accumulation as shown on the payroll for the pay period immediately preceding his/her illness or disability. It is the responsibility of his/her department to verify that sick leave accounts have not been overdrawn; and if a claim exceeds the number of hours an employee has to his/her credit, the department shall correct his/her application.

 8.1.8.6 Sick Leave Transfer Program - Employees shall be afforded the option to transfer and/or receive sick leave in accordance with the terms and conditions of the City's Sick Leave Transfer Program as established and set forth by City Ordinance. All benefits and/or rights existing under such program may be amended and/or terminated at any time as may be determined appropriate by the City. All terms, conditions, and/or benefits of such program shall not be subject to the grievance procedure.

 8.2 Bereavement/Funeral Leave - Regular employees shall be allowed one (1) day off without salary deduction for bereavement purposes in the event of the death of any close relative; provided, however, where attendance at a funeral requires total travel of two hundred (200) miles or more, one (1) additional day with pay shall be allowed; provided, further, the department head may, when circumstances require and upon application stating the reasons therefore, authorize for such purpose not to exceed an additional four (4) days chargeable to the sick leave account of the employee, but no combination of paid absence under this Section shall exceed five (5) days for any one (1) period of absence. In like circumstances and upon like application, the department head may authorize for the purpose of attending the funeral of a relative other than a close relative, a number of days off work not to exceed five (5) days chargeable to the sick leave account of an employee. For purposes of this Section, the term "close relative" shall mean the spouse or domestic partner, child, mother, stepmother, father, stepfather, brother, sister, grandchild, grandfather, or grandmother of the employee or spouse or domestic partner; and the term "relative other than a close relative" shall mean the uncle, aunt, cousin, niece, nephew, or the spouse or domestic partner of the brother, sister, child, or grandchild of the employee or spouse or domestic partner.

 8.2.1 Bereavement/Funeral leave may be allowed for bereavement purposes and/or attendance at the funeral of any other relative as allowed by City Ordinance 114648. Such relatives shall be determined as close relatives or relatives other than close relatives pursuant to the terms of Ordinance 114648 for purposes of determining the extent of bereavement/funeral leave or sick leave allowable as provided for in Section 8.2. In the event Ordinance 114648 is repealed in whole or in part by an initiative, the parties shall renegotiate this provision in accordance with the terms of Article 21.

 8.3 Emergency Leave - One (1) day or portion thereof per Agreement year without loss of pay may be taken off subject to approval of the employee's supervisor and/or department head when it is necessary that the employee be immediately off work to attend to one of the following situations either of which necessitates immediate action on the part of the employee:

 A. The employee's spouse, child, parent, or domestic partner has unexpectedly become seriously ill or has had a serious accident; or

 B. An unforeseen occurrence with respect to the employee's household (e.g., fire or flood, or ongoing loss of power). "Household" shall be defined as the physical aspects of the employee's residence.

 The "day" shall be no more than the equivalent of the number of hours the employee is scheduled to work that day but in no event more than eight (8) hours.

ARTICLE 9 -- INDUSTRIAL INJURY OR ILLNESS

 9.1 Any employee who is disabled in the discharge of his/her duties and if such disablement results in absence from his/her regular duties, shall be compensated, except as otherwise hereinafter provided, in the amount of eighty percent (80%) of the employee's normal hourly rate of pay, not to exceed two hundred sixty-one (261) regularly scheduled workdays counted from the first regularly scheduled workday after the day of the on-the-job injury; provided the disability sustained must qualify the employee for benefits under State Industrial Insurance and Medical Aid Acts.

 9.1.1 Whenever an employee is injured on the job and compelled to seek immediate medical treatment, the employee shall be compensated in full for the remaining part of the day of injury without effect to his/her sick leave or vacation or other paid leave account. Scheduled workdays falling within only the first three (3) calendar days following the day of injury shall be compensated through accrued sick leave. Any earned vacation or other paid leave may be used in a like manner after sick leave is exhausted, provided that, if neither accrued sick leave nor accrued vacation or other paid leave is available, the employee shall be placed on no-pay status for these three (3) days. If the period of disability equals or extends beyond fourteen (14) calendar days, then (1) any accrued sick leave, vacation, or other paid leave utilized due to absence from his/her regular duties as provided for in this Section shall be reinstated and the employee shall be paid in accordance with Section 9.1, which provides payment at the eighty percent (80%) rate; or (2) if no sick leave vacation, or other paid leave was available to the employee at that time, then the employee shall thereafter be compensated for the three (3) calendar days at the eighty percent (80%) compensation rate described in Section 9.1.

 9.1.2 Such compensation shall be authorized by the Personnel Director or his/her designee with the advice of such employee's department head on request from the employee supported by satisfactory evidence of medical treatment of the illness or injury giving rise to such employee's claim for compensation under SMC 4.44, as now or hereinafter amended.

 9.1.3 In no circumstances will the amount paid under these provisions exceed an employee's gross pay minus mandatory deductions (taxes, retirement). This provision shall become effective when SMC 4.44, Disability Compensation, is revised to incorporate this limit.

 9.1.4 Employees must meet the standards listed in SMC 4.44.020 to be eligible for the benefit amount provided herein that exceeds the rate required to be paid by state law, hereinafter referred to as supplemental benefits. These standards require that employees: (1) comply with all Department of Labor and Industries rules and regulations and related City of Seattle and employing department policies and procedures; (2) respond, be available for, and attend medical appointments and treatments and meetings related to rehabilitation, and work hardening, conditioning, or other treatment arranged by the City and authorized by the attending physician; (3) accept modified or alternative duty assigned by supervisors when released to perform such duty by the attending physician; (4) attend all meetings scheduled by the City of Seattle Workers' Compensation unit or employing department concerning the employee's status or claim when properly notified at least five (5) working days in advance of such meeting unless other medical treatment conflicts with the meeting and the employee provides twenty-four (24) hours' notice of such meeting or examination.

 The City will provide a copy of the eligibility requirements to employees when they file a workers' compensation claim. If records indicate two (2) no-shows, supplemental benefits may be terminated no sooner than seven (7) calendar days after notification to the employee.

 9.2 Compensation for holidays and earned vacation falling within a period of absence due to such disability shall be at the normal rate of pay, but such days shall not be considered as regularly scheduled workdays as applied to the time limitations set forth within Section 9.1. Disabled employees affected by the provisions of SMC 4.44 shall continue to accrue vacation and sick leave as though actively employed during the period set forth within Section 9.1.

 9.3 Any employee eligible for the benefits provided by SMC 4.44 whose disability prevents him/her from performing his/her regular duties, but in the judgment of his/her physician could perform duties of a less strenuous nature, shall be employed at his/her normal rate of pay in such other suitable duties as the department head shall direct, with the approval of such employee's physician until the Personnel Director requests closure of such employee's claim pursuant to SMC 44, as now or hereinafter amended.

 9.4 Sick leave shall not be used for any disability herein described except as allowed in Section 9.1.

 9.5 The afore-referenced disability compensation shall be understood to be in lieu of State Industrial Insurance Compensation and Medical Aid.

 9.6 Appeals of any denials under this Article shall be made through the Department of Labor and Industries as prescribed in Title 51 RCW.

Transfer, in lieu of layoff, may be made to a single position in another class when such transfer would constitute a promotion or advancement in the service provided a showing is made that the transferee is capable of satisfactorily performing the duties of the position and that a regular, trial service or probationary employee is not displaced and when transfer in lieu of layoff under Section 11.1.2 (3) is not practicable.

 5. The Personnel Director may approve a transfer under Sections 11.1.2 (1), (2), (3), or (4) above with the consent of the appointing authority of the Receiving Department only, upon a showing of the circumstances justifying such action.

 12.2.1 Commencing with the signing of this Agreement, future premium rebates shall be divided so that forty percent (40%) can be used by the City to pay for the City's share of the monthly premiums, and sixty percent (60%) shall be used for benefit of employees' participating in the Group Term Life Insurance Plan in terms of benefit improvements, to pay the employees' share of the monthly premiums or for life insurance purposes otherwise negotiated.

The VEBA benefit allows employees who are eligible to retire from City Service to cash out their unused sick leave balance upon retirement and place it in a VEBA account to be used for post-retirement healthcare costs as allowed under IRS regulations.

 a. Eligibility-to-Retire Requirements:

 * 5 - 9 years of service and are age 62 or older

 * 10 - 19 years of service and are age 57 or older

 * 20 - 29 years of service and are age 52 or older

 * 30 years of service and are any age

 For purposes of identifying all potential eligible-to-retire employees, the City shall create a list of members who are in the City's HRIS system as age 45 or older as of the final day of the contract term and provide this list to the union so that the union can administer the vote.

 1. If the eligible-to-retire members of the bargaining unit votes to accept the VEBA, then all members of the bargaining unit who retire from City service from the date of the vote until the end of the contract term, shall either:

 a. place their sick leave cashout at 35% into their VEBA account, or

 b. forfeit the sick leave cash out altogether. There is no minimum threshold for the sick leave cash out.

 Members are not eligible to deposit their sick leave cashout into their deferred compensation account or receive cash.

 2. If the eligible-to-retire members of the bargaining unit votes to reject the VEBA, all members of the bargaining unit who retire from City service from the date of the vote until the end of the contract term, shall be ineligible to place their sick leave cashout into a VEBA account. Instead, these members shall have two choices:

 a. Members can cash out their sick leave balance at 35% and deposit those dollars into their deferred compensation account. The annual limits for the deferred compensation contributions as set by the IRS would apply; or

 b. Members can cash out their sick leave balance at 25% and receive the dollars as cash on their final paycheck.

 13.3 Sabbatical Leave and VEBA: Members of a bargaining unit that votes to accept the VEBA and who meet the eligible-to-retire criteria are not eligible to cash out their sick leave at 25% as a part of their sabbatical benefit. Members who do not meet the eligible-to- retire criteria may cash out their sick leave at 25% in accordance with the sabbatical benefit.

Records of any fines imposed or monetary settlements shall not be included in the employee's Personnel file. Fines imposed by the Commission shall be subject to appeal on the record to the Seattle Municipal Court.

 In the event the Employer acts on a recommendation by the Commission to discipline an employee, the employee's contractual rights to contest such discipline shall apply. No record of the disciplinary recommendations by the Commission shall be placed in the employee's Personnel file unless such discipline is upheld or unchallenged. Commission hearings are to be closed if requested by the employee who is the subject of such hearing.

 14.11 The City and the Union encourage the use of the "Early Mediation Project" or other alternative dispute resolution (ADR) processes to resolve non-contractual workplace conflict/disputes. Participation in the project or in an ADR process is entirely voluntary, confidential, and does not impact grievance rights.

 14.12 Employees may be afforded sabbatical leave under the terms and conditions of Seattle Municipal Code Chapter 4.33.

 Determination as to (1), (2), or (3) above shall be made by the department head involved, and their determination is such case shall be final, binding, and not subject to the grievance procedure; provided, however, prior to approval by the department head involved to contract out work under this provision, the Union shall be notified. The department head involved shall make available to the Union upon request (1) a description of the services to be so performed and (2) the detailed factual basis supporting the reasons for such action.

 The Union may grieve contracting out for work as described herein, if such contract involves work normally performed by employees covered by the Agreement, and if that contract is the cause of the layoff of employees covered by this Agreement.

As such, consistent with the interest of developing an employee's career, the City may offer employees on the job training, cross-jurisdictional training, and/or job shadowing and mentoring opportunities.

ARTICLE 15 -- LABOR-MANAGEMENT COMMITTEE

 15.1 The City and the Union agree to establish on an ad hoc basis a joint Labor-Management Committee consisting of three representatives of the Union including the Business Manager or his representative and three representatives of the City including the Director of Labor Relations or his representative. The purpose of this Committee is to address matters of general concern to the Union and the City, as opposed to individual complaints of employees; provided, however, it is understood that the Labor-Management Committee shall function in a consultive capacity and shall not be considered a collective bargaining forum nor a decision-making body.

The Coalition of City Unions will appoint a minimum of six (6) labor representatives and a maximum equal to the number of management representatives of the Committee. The co-chairs of the Coalition will be members of the Leadership Committee.

 15.3 Employment Security - Labor and management support continuing efforts to provide the best service delivery and the highest-quality service in the most cost-effective manner to the citizens of Seattle. Critical to achieving this purpose is the involvement of employees in sharing information and creatively addressing workplace issues, including administrative and service delivery productivity, efficiency, quality controls, and customer service.

 Labor and management agree that, in order to maximize participation and results from the Employee Involvement Committees (EIC), no one will lose employment or equivalent rate of pay with the City of Seattle because of efficiencies resulting from an EIC initiative.

 In instances where the implementation of an EIC recommendation does result in the elimination of a position, management and labor will work together to find suitable alternative employment for the affected employee. An employee who chooses not to participate in and/or accept a reasonable employment offer, if qualified, will terminate his/her rights under this Employment Security provision.

ARTICLE 16 -- WORK STOPPAGES

 16.1 Work Stoppages - The City and the Union signatory to this Agreement agree that the public interest requires the efficient and uninterrupted performance of all City service, and to this end pledge their best efforts to avoid or eliminate any conduct contrary to this objective.

Employees covered by this Agreement who engage in any of the foregoing actions may be subject to such disciplinary actions as may be determined by the City.

 16.1.1 In the event, however, that there is a work stoppage or any other interference with City functions that is not authorized by the Union, the City agrees that there shall be no liability on the part of the Union, its officers, or representatives, provided that in the event of such unauthorized action they first shall meet the following conditions:

 C. The Union, its officers, and representatives shall, in good faith, use every reasonable effort to terminate such unauthorized action;

 D. The Union shall not question the unqualified right of the City to discipline or discharge employees engaging in or encouraging such action. It is understood that such action on the part of the City shall be final and binding upon the Union and its members and shall be in no case construed as a violation by the City of any provision in this Agreement.

ARTICLE 17 -- RIGHTS OF MANAGEMENT

 17.1 The management of the City and the direction of the work force are vested exclusively in the City, except as may be limited by an express provision of this Agreement.

ARTICLE 18 -- SUBORDINATION OF AGREEMENT

 18.1 The parties hereto and the employees of the City are governed by the provisions of applicable federal law, state law, and the City Charter.

 19.2 The parties acknowledge that each has had the unlimited right and opportunity to make demands and proposals with respect to any matter deemed a proper subject for collective bargaining. The results of the exercise of that right are set forth in this Agreement.

ARTICLE 20 -- GRIEVANCE PROCEDURE

 20.1 Any dispute between the City and the Union concerning the interpretation, application, claim of breach, or violation of the express terms of this Agreement shall be deemed a contract grievance. The following outline of grievance procedures is written for a grievance of the Union against the City, but it is understood the steps are similar for a grievance of the City against the Union.

 20.2 A contract grievance in the interest of a majority of the employees in the bargaining unit shall be reduced to writing by the Union and may be introduced at Step 3 of the contract grievance procedure and be processed within the time limits set forth herein.

 20.2.1 Grievances shall be filed at the Step in which there is authority to adjudicate such grievance within twenty (20) business days of the alleged contract violation. (Business days are defined as Monday through Friday excluding recognized City holidays [not to include personal holidays].)

 20.3 As a means of facilitating settlement of a contract grievance, either party may include an additional member at its expense on its committee. If at any Step in the contract grievance procedure, management's answer in writing is unsatisfactory, the Union's reason for non-acceptance must be presented in writing.

 20.4 Failure by an employee or the Union to comply with any time limitation of the procedure in this Article shall constitute withdrawal of the grievance; provided, however, any time limits stipulated in the grievance procedure may be extended for stated periods of time by the appropriate parties by mutual agreement in writing.

 20.4.1 Temporary and intermittent employees pursuant to Section 1.2 of Article 1 may appeal matters through this grievance procedure solely for purposes of adjudicating grievances relating to the contract Sections identified in Section 1.2. The right to grieve such matters shall not include the right to grieve matters involving discipline, discharge, or layoff.

 20.4.2 Where extenuating circumstances warrant and where the Union has initiated a contract grievance at Step 1 in a timely manner, should the Union fail to process the contract grievance within the allotted time limit in Step 2, Step 3, or Step 4, the Union shall be permitted once per grievance to use an additional ten (10) consecutive calendar days to supplement the time period in which to process the contract grievance at that Step of the grievance procedure. The additional ten (10) consecutive calendar day period shall commence immediately upon the expiration of the normal filing period, and a like amount of time shall be deducted from the time period in which to file the contract grievance at the next Step. The Union shall stipulate in writing when initiating the next Step of the grievance procedure that it is exercising the terms of this particular provision. The Union agrees that use of this Section shall be considered an exception that shall be invoked rarely.

 20.5 Arbitration awards or grievance settlements shall not be made retroactive beyond the date of the occurrence or non-occurrence upon which the grievance is based, that date being twenty (20) business days or less prior to the initial filing of the grievance.

 20.6 A contract grievance shall be processed in accordance with the following procedure:

 20.6.1 Step 1 - The contract grievance shall be reduced to written form by the aggrieved employee and/or the Union, stating the section of the agreement allegedly violated and explaining the grievance in detail. The aggrieved employee and/or the Union Representative shall present the written grievance to the employee's supervisor within twenty (20) business days of the alleged contract violation, with a copy of the grievance submitted to the Union by the aggrieved employee. The immediate supervisor should consult and/or arrange a meeting with his/her supervisor, if necessary, to resolve the contract grievance. The parties shall make every effort to settle the contract grievance at this stage promptly. The immediate supervisor shall, in writing, answer the grievance within ten (10) business days after being notified of the grievance, with a copy of the response submitted to the aggrieved employee and the Union.

 20.6.2 Step 2 - If the contract grievance is not resolved as provided in Step 1, or if the contract grievance is initially submitted at Step 2, it shall be reduced to written form, which shall include identification of the Section(s) of the Agreement allegedly violated, the nature of the alleged violation, and the remedy sought. The Union representative shall forward the written contract grievance to the division head, with a copy to the City Director of Labor Relations, within ten (10) business days after the Step 1 answer.

 With Mediation:

 At the time of aggrieved employee and/or the Union submits the grievance to the division had, the Executive Director or his/her designee Union representative or the aggrieved employee or the division head may submit a written request for voluntary mediation assistance, with a copy to the Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) Coordinator, the City Director of Labor Relations, and the Union Representative. If the ADR Coordinator determines that the case is in line with the protocols and procedures of the ADR process, within ten (10) business days from receipt of the request for voluntary mediation assistance, the ADR Coordinator or his/her designee will schedule a mediation conference and make the necessary arrangements for the selection of a mediator(s). The mediator(s) will serve as an impartial third party who will encourage and facilitate a resolution to the dispute. The mediation conference(s) will be confidential and will include the parties. The Union Representative and a Labor Negotiator from City Labor Relations may attend the mediation conference(s). Other persons may attend with the permission of the mediator(s) and both parties. If the parties agree to settle the matter, the mediator(s) will assist in drafting a settlement agreement, which the parties shall sign. An executed copy of the settlement agreement shall be provided to the parties, with either a copy or signed statement of the disposition of the grievance submitted to the City Director of Labor Relations and the Union. The relevant terms of the settlement agreement shall be provided by the parties to the department's designated officials who need to assist in the implementing the agreement. If the grievance is not settled within ten (10) business days of the initial mediation conference date, the City Director of Labor Relations, the appropriate division head, and the appropriate Union Representative shall be so informed by the ADR Coordinator.

 The parties to a mediation shall have no power through a settlement agreement to add to, subtract from, alter, change, or modify the terms of the collective bargaining agreement or to apply the settlement agreement to any circumstance beyond the explicit dispute applicable to said settlement agreement.

 If the grievance is not resolved through mediation, the division head shall thereafter convene a meeting within ten (10) business days between the Union representative and aggrieved employee, together with the designated supervisor, the section manager, the department labor relations officer and any other members of management whose presence is deemed necessary by the City to a fair consideration of the alleged contract grievance. The City Director of Labor Relations or his/her designee may attend said meeting. The division head shall give a written answer to the Union within ten (10) business days after the contract grievance meeting.

 20.6.3 Step 3 - If the contract grievance is not resolved as provided in Step 2, the written contract grievance defined in the same manner as provided in Step 2 shall be forwarded within ten (10) business days after the Step 2 answer or within twenty (20) business days if initially submitted at Step 3, to the City Director of Labor Relations with a copy to the appropriate department head. The Director of Labor Relations or his/her designee shall investigate the alleged contract grievance, and, if deemed appropriate, he/she shall convene a meeting between the appropriate parties within ten (10) business days. He/she shall thereafter make a confidential recommendation to the affected department head who shall, in turn, give the Union an answer in writing ten (10) business days after receipt of the contract grievance or the meeting between the parties.

 Mediation can be requested at Step 3 in the same manner as outlined in Step 2. The grievance must be filed in the time frame specified in Step 3 and responded to in the frame specified after receipt of notification from the ADR Coordinator that the grievance was not resolved through mediation.

 20.6.4 Step 4 - If the contract grievance is not settled in Step 3, either of the signatory parties to this Agreement may submit the grievance to binding arbitration. It may be referred to the Federal Mediation and Conciliation Service for arbitration to be conducted under its voluntary labor arbitration regulations. Such reference to arbitration shall be made within twenty (20) business days after the City's answer or failure to answer in Step 4 and shall be accompanied by the following information:

 A. Identification of Section(s) of Agreement allegedly violated;

 B. Nature of the alleged violation;

 C. Question(s) that the arbitrator is being asked to decide;

 D. Remedy sought.

 In lieu of the procedure set forth in Section 20.6.4, Step 4, the City and the Union may mutually agree to select an arbitrator to decide the issue.

 Mediation can be requested at Step 4 in the same manner as outlined in Step 2. The grievance must be submitted to binding arbitration within the time frame specified in Step 4 and processed within the time frame specified in Step 4 after receipt of notification from the ADR Coordinator that the grievance was not resolved in mediation.

 20.6.5 A reclassification grievance will be initially submitted by the Union, in writing, to the Director of Labor Relations, with a copy to the Department. The Union will identify in the grievance letter the name(s) of the grievant(s), their current job classification, and the proposed job classification. The Union will include with the grievance letter a Position Description Questionnaire (PDQ) completed and signed by the grievant(s). At the time of the initial filing, if the PDQ is not submitted, the Union will have sixty (60) business days to submit the PDQ to Labor Relations. After initial submittal of the grievance, the procedure will be as follows:

 1. The Director of Labor Relations, or designee, will notify the Union of such receipt and will provide a date [not to exceed six (6) months from the date of receipt of the grievance] when a proposed classification determination report responding to the grievance will be sent to the Union. The Director of Labor Relations, or designee, will provide notice to the Union when, due to unforeseen delays, the time for the classification review will exceed the six (6) month period.

 2. The Department Director, upon receipt of the proposed classification determination report from the Director of Labor Relations, or designee, will respond to the grievance in writing.

 3. If the grievance is not resolved, the Union may, within twenty (20) business days of the date the grievance response is received, submit to the Director of Labor Relations a letter designating one of the following processes for final resolution:

 A. The Union may submit the grievance to binding arbitration per Article 20, Section 20.6.4; or

 B. The Union may request the classification determination be reviewed by the Classification Appeals Board, consisting of two members of the Classification/Compensation Unit and one Human Resource professional from an unaffected department. The Classification Appeals Board will, whenever possible, within ten (10) business days of receipt of the request, arrange a hearing; and, when possible, convene the hearing within thirty (30) business days. The Board will make a recommendation to the Personnel Director with forty-five (45) business days of the appeal hearing. The Director of Labor Relations, or designee, will respond to the Union after receipt of the Personnel Director's determination. If the Personnel Director affirms the Classification Board's recommendation, that decision shall be final and binding and not subject to further appeal. If the Personnel Director does not affirm the Classification Appeals Board recommendation within fifteen (15) business days, the Union may submit the grievance to arbitration per Article 20, Section 20.6.4.

 20.7 The parties shall abide by the award made in connection with any arbitrable difference. There shall be no suspension of work, slowdown, or curtailment of services while any difference is in process of adjustment or arbitration.

 20.8 In connection with any arbitration proceeding held pursuant to this Agreement, it is understood that:

 20.8.1 The arbitrator shall have no power to render a decision that will add to, subtract from or alter, change, or modify the terms of this Agreement, and his power shall be limited to interpretation or application of the express terms of this Agreement, and all other matters shall be excluded from arbitration.

 20.8.2 The decision of the arbitrator regarding any arbitrable difference shall be final, conclusive, and binding upon the City, the Union, and the employees involved.

 20.8.3 The cost of the arbitrator shall be borne equally by the City and the Union and each party shall bear the cost of presenting its own case.

 20.8.4 The arbitrator's decision shall be made in writing and shall be issued to the parties within thirty (30) days after the case is submitted to the arbitrator.

 20.9 In no event shall this Agreement alter or interfere with disciplinary procedures followed by the City or provided for by City Charter, Ordinance or Law; provided, however, disciplinary action may be processed through the contract grievance procedure; provided, further, an employee covered by this Agreement must upon initiating objections relating to disciplinary action use either the contract grievance procedure contained herein (with the Union processing the grievance) or pertinent Civil Service procedures regarding disciplinary appeals. Should the employee attempt to adjudicate his/her objections relating to a disciplinary action through both the grievance procedure and the Civil Service Commission, the grievance shall be considered withdrawn upon first notice that an appeal has been filed before the Civil Service Commission.

 20.10 The parties have agreed, through a Memorandum of Agreement, to adopt the following two procedures attached thereto that were developed by the Citywide Labor-Management Committee on Progressive Discipline:

 A. Either party may request that grievances submitted to arbitration be subjected to a confidential Peer Review by a committee of peers from management or labor, respectively, in which case the time lines of the grievance procedure will be held in abeyance pending the completion of the Peer Review process; and

 B. Either party may make an Offer of Settlement to encourage settlement of a grievance in advance of a scheduled arbitration hearing, with the potential consequence that the party refusing to accept an Offer of Settlement may be required to bear all of the costs of arbitration, excluding attorney and witness fees, contrary to Section 20.8.3.

 The parties may mutually agree to alter, amend, or eliminate these procedures by executing a revised Memorandum of Agreement.

ARTICLE 21 -- SAVINGS CLAUSE

 21.1 If an Article of this Agreement or the Appendix attached thereto should be held invalid by operation of law or by any tribunal of competent jurisdiction, or if compliance with or enforcement of any Article should be restrained by such tribunal, the remainder of this Agreement and Addenda shall not be affected hereby, and the parties shall enter into immediate collective bargaining negotiations for the purpose of arriving at a mutually satisfactory replacement for such Article.

 ARTICLE 22 - DISCIPLINARY ACTIONS

 22.1 The parties agree that in their respective roles primary emphasis shall be placed on preventing situations requiring disciplinary actions through effective employee-management relations. The primary objective of discipline shall be to correct and rehabilitate, not to punish or penalize. To this end, in order of increasing severity, the disciplinary actions that the City may take against an employee include:

 A. Verbal warning;

 B. Written reprimand;

 C. Suspension;

 D. Demotion; or

 E. Termination.

 Which disciplinary action is taken depends upon seriousness of the affected employee's conduct.

 22.2 In cases of suspension or discharge, the specified charges and duration, where applicable, of the action shall be furnished to the employee in writing not later than one (1) working day after the action became or becomes effective. An employee may be suspended for just cause pending demotion or discharge action.

ARTICLE 23 -- TERM OF AGREEMENT

 23.1 All terms and provisions of this Agreement shall become effective upon signature of both parties unless otherwise specified elsewhere, and shall remain in full force and effect through December 31, 2010.

 23.2 Notwithstanding the provisions of Section 23.1, in the event negotiations for a new Agreement extend beyond the anniversary date of this Agreement, all of the terms and provisions of this Agreement shall continue to remain in full force and effect during the course of collective bargaining until such time as the terms of a new Agreement have been consummated or unless either party serves the other party with ten (10) days' written notice of intent to terminate the existing Agreement.

Regular work hours are 10:00 a.m. to 10:00 p.m. Hours worked over 40 hours per week shall be paid one and one-half (11/2) times the base hourly rate.

Under no conditions may the pool be left unattended when there are people in the natatorium.

 B.3 In place of the third paragraph of 5.1.1 for Meal Period: Should an employee be required to work through the scheduled meal period and unable to reschedule the meal period some other time during the shift, all hours worked through the scheduled meal period shall be compensated at one and one half (11/2) times the straight time rate of pay.

 B.4 In place of 8.1.8.1 - Prompt Notification: The employee shall promptly notify the immediate supervisor or another appropriate person, by telephone or otherwise, on the first day off due to illness and each day thereafter unless advised otherwise by the immediate supervisor. For those absences of more than one (1) day, notification on his/her first day off with an expected date of return shall suffice. The employee shall notify, as far as possible in advance of the scheduled time to report for work, particularly where a relief replacement is necessary when the employee is absent.

 B.5 Rotation: The rotation schedule will be determined by the safety needs of the pool and are subject to the discretion of the supervisor. Work hours include rotation and non-rotation work.

 B.7 Certifications: Certification requirements per job announcement must be in place in order to be hired, and the employee will obtain these certifications at their own expense.

Once hired, re-certification may be obtained on work release time and at City expense. (Books and materials needed for re-certification processes will be made available to be borrowed by employees.) If an employee allows their certification(s) to lapse, re-certification must be obtained on employee's own time, and at their own expense.

 B.7.2 The pool supervisor will keep a copy of certification records, cards and/or copies of WSI paperwork on file.

If regular Senior Lifeguards and regular Lifeguards let their certification lapse, they will not be able to work because of State, County, and City regulations and requirements. Regular Senior Lifeguards and regular Lifeguards with lapsed certifications will be placed on unpaid leave until their certifications are restored.

 B.8 Fit for Duty: Regular Senior Lifeguards and regular Lifeguards must be physically fit and mentally prepared to perform in an emergency situation.
