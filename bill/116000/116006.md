 Section 2. The 2008 Table of Proposed Projects represents the City's plan and proposal to HUD for the use of the funds shown as allocated in the 2008 Table of Proposed Projects. The Plan as amended by the adopted 2008 Update, including such Table and the descriptions of strategies, housing policies, and allocation policies, is intended to serve the functions set forth in 24 CFR Section 91.1(b), but the contents of the 2008 Update are not otherwise intended to have legal effect except as otherwise specifically stated in the 2008 Update.

 Section 3. The allocations set forth in the adopted 2008 Update do not constitute appropriations or modify the amounts of any existing appropriations, nor are they to be considered as final funding decisions. The authority of the respective City departments and offices to implement the activities set forth in the adopted 2008 Update is subject to sufficient appropriations in the City of Seattle 2008 Adopted Budget or in any separate ordinance. Implementation of any specific project or program is also subject to a final determination by the appropriate office or department after completion of any necessary review under environmental and related laws. No part of the adopted 2008 Update or the Plan is intended to confer any legal rights or entitlements on any persons, groups or entities.

 Section 4. The Mayor and the Director of Human Services ("the Director") and their designees are hereby authorized to submit the adopted 2008 Update to the 2005-2008 Consolidated Plan for Housing and Community Development, together with any necessary supplementary material, to the United States Department of Housing and Urban Development ("HUD") as the application by the City for financial assistance under certain HUD programs; to represent the City in seeking HUD approval of the adopted 2008 Update, to make and submit to HUD such modifications to the adopted 2008 Update or the Plan as HUD may require, provided that no substantial policy changes are involved; and to sign and deliver on behalf of the City such assurances and certifications as may be necessary to obtain HUD approval. The Director is further authorized to make such technical and conforming changes to the Plan as she may deem reasonably necessary, and to amend the Plan, if necessary or appropriate under federal regulations, to reflect funding of specific activities, final appropriations for the programs or budget control levels in the Adopted Budget, or changes in activities that are consistent with the policies and priorities established in the Plan. The Director shall notify the Council of all changes or amendments to the Plan. Any substantial amendment, as defined by the adopted Citizen Participation Plan in the 2005 - 2008 Consolidated Plan, as amended, shall be approved by the Council by ordinance or resolution.

 Section 5. This ordinance shall take effect and be in force thirty (30) days from and after its approval by the Mayor, but if not approved and returned by the Mayor within ten (10) days after presentation, it shall take effect as provided by Municipal Code Section 1.04.020.
