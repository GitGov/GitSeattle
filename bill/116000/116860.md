 ORDINANCE 123352

 AN ORDINANCE transferring jurisdiction of the Georgetown Pump Station property from Seattle City Light to the Department of Parks and Recreation for open space, park, and recreation purposes; and increasing appropriations to the Department of Parks and Recreation in the 2010 Budget; all by a three-fourths vote of the City Council.

 WHEREAS, Seattle City Light ("City Light") acquired the Georgetown Pump Station property ("Pump Station Property") to serve the Georgetown Steam Plant for hydroelectric utility purposes, but because steam technology became obsolete the Pump Station Property is no longer required for electric utility purposes; and

 WHEREAS, the Georgetown Pump Station has been listed as a landmark on the National Register of Historic Places, due to its relationship to the Georgetown Steam Plant, which was built in 1907 and provided early electrical service to the City and is both on the National Register of Historic Places and is a City of Seattle Landmark; and

 WHEREAS, the Neighborhood Parks, Green Spaces, Trails, and Zoo Levy ("2000 Parks Levy"), as proposed by Ordinance 120024 and approved by Seattle voters on November 7, 2000, provides funds for acquisition of new neighborhood parks and green spaces; and

 WHEREAS, Ordinance 120024 established a Parks and Green Spaces Levy Oversight Committee ("Oversight Committee"), with responsibilities to include adopting evaluation criteria and recommending Opportunity Fund awards to the Superintendent of Parks and Recreation, Mayor and City Council; and

 WHEREAS, the Oversight Committee recommended granting a 2000 Parks Levy Development and Opportunity Fund first-cycle award for the acquisition of the Pump Station Property; and

 WHEREAS, the City Council and the Mayor approved the Oversight Committee's recommendation in Ordinance 120869 in 2002; and

 WHEREAS, Ordinance 122729 includes the Pump Station Property in a master lease between the City and Bluefields Holding, Inc. for development and enhancement of habitat on City property along the Duwamish River; and

 WHEREAS, the Superintendent of City Light and the Superintendent of Parks and Recreation have agreed to transfer jurisdiction of the Pump Station Property from City Light to the Department of Parks and Recreation subject to certain conditions; and

 WHEREAS, with the transfer the City reinforces its commitment to habitat protection and restoration outlined in Ordinance 122729 but also recognizes that a determination must be made if the Georgetown Pump Station meets the City's definition of a Landmark under Seattle Municipal Code 25.12., and that these two policies are not incompatible; and

 WHEREAS, City Light has determined the fair market value of the Pump Station Property by real estate appraisal, which assumes there are no Hazardous Substances (as hereinafter defined) in or on the Pump Station Property that would affect the value of the Pump Station Property; NOW, THEREFORE,

 BE IT ORDAINED BY THE CITY OF SEATTLE AS FOLLOWS:

 Section 1. The City Council finds and declares that the Georgetown Pump Station Property ("Pump Station Property"), legally described in Section 2 below, is not required for electric utility purposes and is surplus to the needs of Seattle City Light ("City Light").

 is hereby transferred from City Light to the Department of Parks and Recreation for open space, park, and recreation purposes, in consideration of payment of Ninety Thousand Dollars ($90,000) to the Light Fund (Fund 41000) from the 2000 Parks Levy Fund.
