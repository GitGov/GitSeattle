 AN ORDINANCE relating to the 14th Ave. S Street Improvements project and the Bike Master Plan Implementation program; authorizing the Director of Transportation to acquire property rights necessary for widening an existing sidewalk on the east side of 14th Avenue South between S Director Street and S Henderson Street; authorizing acquisition of real property rights, through negotiation and use of eminent domain (condemnation); and authorizing payment of all other costs associated with the acquisition.

 WHEREAS, in 1998 (updated in 2005) the City adopted the Transportation Strategic Plan that sets strategies for achieving Seattle Comprehensive Plan goals; and

 WHEREAS, the 14th Ave. S Street Improvements project is consistent with Seattle Comprehensive Plan and Transportation Strategic Plan goals to meet the current and future mobility needs of residents, businesses and visitors with a balanced transportation system, and to make the best use of the City's limited street capacity while seeking to balance competing uses; and

 WHEREAS, the Seattle Department of Transportation will use this opportunity to leverage funding from the "Bridging the Gap" Bike Master Plan Implementation program to supplement the budget of the 14th Ave. S Street Improvements project for the acquisition of the real property; and

 WHEREAS, the property will be used to widen a section that is part of the larger Duwamish Bike Trail which currently does not meet standards for a multi-use path; and

 WHEREAS, this project will improve conditions for freight, pedestrians, cyclists, and general-purpose traffic on a key access route that serves two Comprehensive Plan designated centers (the Duwamish Manufacturing and Industrial Center, and the South Park Residential Urban Village) and is consistent with the goal of encouraging development and density in designated centers; and

 WHEREAS, the project is part of the City's plan to increase public sector investment in the South Park Neighborhood and to support the South Park Action Agenda; NOW, THEREFORE,
