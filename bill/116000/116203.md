 ORDINANCE _________________

 AN ORDINANCE relating to stormwater and flood control by Seattle Public Utilities; selecting a preferred alternative for implementing a long-term flood control project in Madison Valley, and removing a proviso in the 2008 City Budget that limits expenditures on that project.

 WHEREAS, a number of residents in the Madison Valley neighborhood have periodically experienced sewer backups and stormwater flooding during very large storms despite various improvements made to the Seattle Public Utilities ("SPU") combined sewer system over the years; and

 WHEREAS, the adopted 2008 City Budget includes a proviso limiting the expenditure of funds appropriated for the Madison Valley Long-Term Solution CIP project ("Madison Valley Project") until SPU reports to Council on (i) the process for gathering and incorporating community input and including design elements to integrate the project into the surrounding neighborhood, (ii) how the project, including mitigation and neighborhood design elements, will be funded and (iii) whether additional funding is needed to accomplish the full project scope; and

 WHEREAS, SPU has held numerous meetings with the Madison Valley community to review potential long-term solutions to alleviate flooding, and SPU has developed a community involvement plan that describes how SPU has engaged the community thus far and will continue to engage the community to gather input on design elements that integrate the project into the surrounding neighborhood; and

 WHEREAS, based in part on community input, the Council and Mayor have determined the NW Diversion and Washington Park Storage Alternative (the "Diversion and Storage Alternative") to the Madison Valley Project will provide a long-term approach that most effectively alleviates sewer backups and stormwater flooding in Madison Valley; and

 WHEREAS, the Diversion and Storage Alternative includes diversion of stormwater flows from the northwest portion of the Madison Valley drainage basin to an area south of the Washington Park Playfield, through new stormwater pipes in streets to be determined during the design phase of the project; construction of approximately 2 million gallons of above-ground or below-ground stormwater storage in Washington Park; and expansion of the existing above-ground storage facility in the 100 block of 30th Avenue E. near E. John Street so that it can hold approximately 1.8 million gallons of stormwater; and

 WHEREAS, it is necessary to remove a proviso to the 2008 Adopted City Budget in order for the Diversion and Storage Alternative to the Madison Valley Project to move forward; NOW, THEREFORE,

 BE IT ORDAINED BY THE CITY OF SEATTLE AS FOLLOWS:

 Section 1. The City authorizes final design and construction of the Diversion and Storage Alternative for the Madison Valley Project.

 Section 2. The restrictions imposed on expenditures related to design and construction of the Madison Valley Project (ID C307014) by the following 2008 City Budget proviso are removed in their entirety and are no longer restrictions for any purpose related to the project, including for Subsection 1(b) of Ordinance 122560:

 Department Green Sheet # Proviso Description BCL Code Seattle 24-1-A-2 Limits spending C332B Public Utilities on the Madison Valley Long-Term Solution CIP project

 Funds appropriated in BCL C332B of the 2008 City Budget and allocated to the Madison Valley Long-Term Solution CIP project shall be used only to implement the Diversion and Storage Alternative.

 Section 3. The Council directs that:

 A. Within 60 days of the effective date of this ordinance, SPU will submit to the Council a Madison Valley Long Term Solution public involvement plan. SPU will seek and incorporate public input on the plan prior to its submittal. The plan will:

 i. Identify the types of public meetings and input opportunities to be offered.

 ii. List the groups that will be notified of project meetings and comment opportunities.

 iii. Provide a schedule for public input opportunities, with opportunities offered at a specified frequency and at key project milestones including at 30 percent design and prior to the start of construction.

 iv. Describe how public input will be received on substantive project decisions including selection of the final project sub- elements, methods to minimize construction impacts and ways to integrate the project (including any above-ground stormwater storage) into the surrounding neighborhood while still meeting stormwater management needs.

 v. Describe how the Madison Valley business community will be involved in design and scheduling choices to minimize project impacts on local businesses.

 B. Upon completion of the 30 percent project design for any portion of the project and prior to start of construction, SPU will submit a report to the Council that describes the project elements (including elements to integrate the project into the surrounding neighborhood), project schedule, costs, funding sources and a summary of public involvement steps and comments.

 Section 4. Any act consistent with the authority of this ordinance that is taken after passage of this ordinance but prior to its effective date is hereby ratified and confirmed.

 Section 5. This ordinance shall take effect and be in force thirty (30) days from and after its approval by the Mayor, but if not approved and returned by the Mayor within ten (10) days after presentation, it shall take effect as provided by Municipal Code Section 1.04.020.
