 ORDINANCE _________________

 WHEREAS, Ordinance 122232 authorized a vote on a property tax levy for transportation improvements that was approved by the voters in November 2006, Ordinance 122191 imposed an employee hours tax for transportation purposes, Ordinance 122192 imposed a commercial parking tax for transportation purposes, and Resolution 30915 collectively refers to these referenced funding sources and the transportation improvements for which the collected revenues will be used as the "Bridging the Gap" transportation funding package; and

 WHEREAS, the Mayor has proposed and the City Council has approved a 2008 Budget and 2008-2013 Capital Improvement Program that includes design and construction activities for the Arterial Asphalt and Concrete Program; and

 WHEREAS, it is in the City's best interest to fund and accelerate paving improvements so that the most important streets to and through downtown are in the best possible condition prior to construction of the Alaskan Way Viaduct (AWV) replacement project; and

 WHEREAS, accelerating the "Bridging the Gap" paving program will provide for accelerated paving in 2008 and deliver additional lane- miles of street resurfacing through avoidance of inflation and increases in construction costs; and

 WHEREAS, for clear financial tracking, the Seattle Department of Transportation will establish a new sub-fund called the Arterial Asphalt and Concrete Paving Subfund within the Transportation Master Fund where all the expenditures related to the "Bridging the Gap" Arterial Asphalt and Concrete Program will be collected; and

 WHEREAS, there is sufficient cash in the City's Consolidated (Residual) Cash Pool or its participating funds to support a loan of up to Eleven Million Five Hundred Forty Thousand Dollars ($11,540,000) to the new sub-fund in the Transportation Master Fund terminating no later than December 31, 2009; and

 WHEREAS, it is anticipated that this debt will be repaid from revenues authorized in Ordinances 122232, 122191, and 122192; and

 WHEREAS, as part of the 2009 Budget process, the City will determine whether to extend this Cash Pool loan, or to refinance it with bonds to be retired by 2015; NOW, THEREFORE,

This loan is to be repaid no later than December 31, 2009 with interest on the loan at the rate of return of the City's Consolidated (Residual) Cash Pool.

 Section 2.
