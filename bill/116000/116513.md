 AN ORDINANCE relating to the Seattle Department of Transportation; authorizing the Director of the Department of Transportation to accept, on behalf of the City of Seattle, a permanent easement from Alki Developments, Ltd., located in a portion of Lot 10, Block 64 of the Replat of West Seattle Land & Improvement Company's Third Plat for the purpose of slope stabilization in connection with the California Way SW/Harbor Avenue SW Slope Stabilization project.

 WHEREAS, during a five-inch-rainstorm event that occurred at the beginning of December 2007, a landslide occurred approximately 500 feet uphill south of the intersection of Ferry Avenue SW and California Way SW in West Seattle; and

 WHEREAS, the landslide damaged the shoulder of Ferry Avenue and left debris along the sidewalk and intersection of California Way SW and Harbor Avenue SW, just south of the existing concrete retaining wall constructed along the uphill side of California Way SW, and on the slope between Ferry Avenue SW and California Way SW; and

 WHEREAS, immediately after the landslide the City obtained a geotechnical engineering investigation of the area and a recommendation was subsequently provided to the City; and

 WHEREAS, the landslide debris was subsequently cleared and temporary measures have been implemented by the City including placing an asphalt curb above the slope to control surface water from flowing over the roadway and down the slope and placing plastic sheeting on the slope surface to minimize water migration; and
