 AN ORDINANCE relating to a portion of Bell Street and the 2008 Parks and Green Space Levy; designating a portion of Bell Street between 1st Avenue and 5th Avenue as a park boulevard; amending Appendices I and II to Ordinance 117569 and to Title 15 of the Seattle Municipal Code (Description and Maps of Park Drives and Boulevards); transferring administrative jurisdiction over that portion of Bell Street from the Seattle Department of Transportation to the Department of Parks and Recreation; authorizing the transfer of 2008 Parks and Green Spaces Levy allocations between categories; amending the 2009-2014 Capital Improvement Program; establishing a new project; and increasing appropriations in connection thereto; all by a three-fourths vote of the City Council.

 WHEREAS, the Seattle City Council embraced the Goals and Principles of Open Space Seattle 2100 by proclamation in May 2006, and later endorsed Open Space Seattle 2100 concepts to integrate green infrastructure and urban sustainability efforts; and

 WHEREAS, in 1998 the Belltown / Denny Regrade Neighborhood Plan was completed, calling for creation of "Green Streets" on Bell and Blanchard Streets, as a creative way to provide usable open space and improve connections to adjacent parks and the waterfront; and

 WHEREAS, in Resolution 31055 the Council created the Parks and Green Spaces Levy Citizens' Advisory Committee to ensure citizen participation in the development of a potential package of parks, open space, boulevards, trails, green infrastructure, and recreation projects and a proposed set of options to fund the package; and

 WHEREAS, the Parks and Green Spaces Levy Citizens' Advisory Committee, after being duly appointed and after spending many hours in open meetings and receiving public testimony and deliberating on the levy, voted by a strong majority to recommend that the City Council place a $145.5 million six-year levy proposal for park purposes before the voters of Seattle; and

 WHEREAS, in response to this recommendation, the City Council passed Ordinance 122749, placing Proposition 2, the 2008 Parks and Green Spaces Levy before the voters of Seattle; and

 WHEREAS, the 2008 Parks and Green Spaces Levy (Levy) was approved by Seattle voters on November 4, 2008; and

 WHEREAS, Resolution 31703, a companion legislation to Ordinance 122749, requests better coordination between City departments in creating green infrastructure and green connections on City-owned land, including but not limited to, street ends, and utility and street rights-of-way, and requests the identification of prototype projects; and

 WHEREAS, Seattle City Light is replacing infrastructure in the Bell Street right-of-way that provides the City with an opportunity to coordinate a joint Park Boulevard project on Bell Street, which is located in the Belltown Urban Village; and

 WHEREAS, Ordinance 122749 identifies the Belltown Urban Village for a potential neighborhood park acquisition; and

 WHEREAS, the Department of Parks and Recreation considers Belltown as significantly underserved with quality open space and is, therefore, a priority for additional development of parks and open space; and

 WHEREAS, the development of a Park Boulevard would provide the same benefits as a neighborhood park and is a far more viable approach given the scarcity and high cost of land suitable for park acquisition and development in the downtown area; and

 WHEREAS, the Belltown Community Council, the Belltown Business Association and the Belltown Housing and Land Use Committee have requested that the City prioritize development of Bell Street as a Park Boulevard (see Exhibit 1) over land acquisition: and

 WHEREAS, the Parks and Green Spaces Levy Citizen Oversight Committee recommends that the Department of Parks and Recreation pursue the Bell Park Boulevard street project using Parks and Green Spaces Levy funds; and

 WHEREAS, on April 27, 2009 the Parks and Green Spaces Levy Citizen Oversight Committee approved a Parks Department recommendation to amend Ordinance 122749 to transfer $2.5 million from the acquisition to development category for Bell Street Park Boulevard Development, NOW, THEREFORE

 BE IT ORDAINED BY THE CITY OF SEATTLE AS FOLLOWS:
