 STATE OF WASHINGTON

 DEPARTMENT OF ECOLOGY

 IN THE MATTER OF AN ) DRAFT AGREED ORDER No. 8040

 ADMINISTRATIVE ORDER )

 AGAINST: )

 City of Seattle, Seattle Public Utilities )

 To: Mr. Ray Hoffman

 City of Seattle

 Seattle Public Utilities

 700 5th Ave, Suite 4900

 Seattle, WA 98124-4018

 For the sites located at: City of Seattle Combined Sewer Overflow system

 I. INTRODUCTION

 This is an Agreed Order between the Department of Ecology (Ecology) and the City of Seattle, Seattle Public Utilities (SPU) to achieve compliance with SPU's National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) Permit No. WA-003168-2 (Permit), Chapter 90.48 Revised Code of Washington (RCW) and Chapters 173-245 Washington Administrative Code (WAC) by taking certain actions which are described below to ensure that all remaining combined sewer overflow (CSO) reduction projects are completed to achieve the greatest reasonable reduction of CSOs at the earliest possible date.

 II. RECOGNITION OF ECOLOGY'S JURISDICTION

 This Agreed Order is issued pursuant to the authority vested in Ecology by the Federal Water Pollution Control Act (FWPCA), 33 U.S.C. sec 1311, et seq. and Chapter 90.48 RCW.

 RCW 90.48.030 provides that Ecology shall have the jurisdiction to control and prevent the pollution of streams, lakes, rivers, ponds, inland waters, salt waters, water courses, other surface and

 underground waters of the state of Washington.

 RCW 90.48.120(2) authorizes Ecology to issue administrative orders requiring compliance whenever it determines that a person has violated or created a substantial potential to violate any provision of chapter 90.48 RCW or fails to control the polluting content of waste to be discharged to waters of the state.

 SPU agrees not to appeal this Agreed Order.

 Nothing in this Agreed Order shall in any way relieve SPU of its obligations to comply with the requirements of its Permit. Nor shall anything in this Agreed Order limit Ecology's authority to enforce the provisions of the aforementioned Permit.

 III. FINDINGS OF FACT

 Ecology's determination that there is a substantial potential for a violation is based on the following facts.

 According to Washington Law (RCW 90.48.480), Ecology shall work with local governments to develop reasonable plans and compliance schedules for the greatest reasonable reduction of CSOs. The plans shall address various options, including construction of storage tanks and separation of sewage and stormwater collection systems. Compliance schedules shall be designed to achieve the greatest reasonable reduction of CSOs at the earliest possible date. The plans and compliance schedules shall be completed by January 1, 1988. A compliance schedule will be a condition of any waste discharge permit issued or renewed after January 1, 1988. As currently contained in NPDES permits, compliance schedules typically last 5 years and do not encompass the much longer time scale of an overall CSO reduction program.

 Per  WAC 173-245-020(7) , CSO Reduction Plans are comprehensive plans that describe how a municipality will attain the greatest reasonable reduction of CSOs at the earliest possible date. CSO Reduction Plan specific requirements are described in  WAC 173-245-040  and include the following elements:

 ? Documentation of CSO Activities

 ? Analysis of CSO control and treatment alternatives

 ? Analysis of selected control and treatment projects

 ? Priority ranking of CSO reduction projects

 ? A proposed schedule for achievement of the "greatest reasonable reduction"

 SPU submitted its City of Seattle Combined Sewer Overflow Control Plan to Ecology for review and approval in 1988 in accordance with WAC 173-245-020. SPU submitted CSO Reduction Plan Amendments to Ecology in December 2001 and in December 2005 in accordance with WAC 173-245-090(2). Both the 2001 CSO Reduction Plan Amendment and the 2005 CSO Reduction Plan Letter Update made significant changes to the previously approved 1988 CSO Reduction Plan after SPU learned more about the size and complexity of the CSO controls that would be needed to reduce the frequency of CSOs to one overflow per site per year. Both Plan Amendments identified a completion date of 2020 for reducing all CSOs down to one overflow per site per year.

 SPU's current NPDES Permit, Special Condition No. S5.B. requires the submittal of a Combined Sewer Overflow Reduction Plan Amendment by May 31, 2010 for Ecology's review and approval. The 2010 CSO Reduction Plan Amendment was received on May 25, 2010. Table 5-5 in this plan lists 37 CSO Basins that require projects to be completed in order to meet  WAC 173-245- 020(22) , one untreated discharge event per year on average. The table lists 16 CSO basins that are anticipated to be under control between the years 2018 to 2025. SPU's proposal to potentially complete projects after 2020 is not consistent with the 2020 completion date in the approved 2001 CSO Reduction Plan Amendment. Ecology will allow for the completion of construction of CSO reduction projects to extend until December 31, 2025 if the end date is incorporated into a legally enforceable document, such as an Agreed Order.

 Basis of Order:

 Washington state law,  RCW 90.48.480 , says that "...A compliance schedule will be a condition of any waste discharge permit issued or renewed after January 1, 1988..." To date, Ecology has incorporated compliance schedules in all NPDES permits that authorize CSO discharges. These compliance schedules have been limited to include only those milestones and projects that must be completed during the term of the permit, 5 years. Planned projects that fall outside the permit term are incorporated into future permits.

 Projects that remain outside the term of the present permit are not captured in an enforceable document. For CSO Reduction Plan projects outside the permit's compliance schedule, an order is an appropriate enforcement mechanism to ensure compliance with the law.  WAC 173-245-090(2)(c) , states that, "The department of ecology may incorporate such a schedule into an administrative order...".

 The 2010 CSO Reduction Plan Amendment contains a number of CSO reduction projects that have projected completion dates of 2025. Upon approval of that plan, Ecology acknowledges the year 2025 is the "earliest possible date" for the purpose of compliance with the law.

 IV. COMPLIANCE SCHEDULE

 In accordance with RCW 90.48.120(2) IT IS AGREED, that SPU must take the following actions by the date (milestone) set forth below. These actions are necessary to satisfy the requirements of Chapters 173-245 WAC. SPU has participated in defining these actions and the milestone by which they shall be completed.

 ? In order to meet the requirements of WAC 173-245- 020(22), SPU shall complete construction of CSO reduction projects identified in the 2010 CSO Reduction Plan Amendment or future amendments submitted by the City and approved by Ecology to reduce CSOs from the remaining 37 uncontrolled CSO basins down to an average of one overflow per site per year by December 31, 2025. Future CSO Reduction Plan Amendments may not result in a compliance date later than December 31, 2025.

 V. PROGRESS REPORTING

 SPU shall immediately notify Ecology of any occurrence which may result in noncompliance with the requirements of this Agreed Order. Such notifications shall state the nature of the potential noncompliance, the reason(s) therefore and the actions taken by SPU to address the potential noncompliance.

 VI. AMENDMENTS TO THE AGREED COMPLIANCE SCHEDULE

 Amendments to the agreed compliance schedule may be requested for good cause. Extension of the deadline imposed by this Agreed Order is unlikely and will only be granted when requests for extensions are submitted in writing, in a timely fashion, and demonstrate good cause for granting the extension. Failure to obtain financial assistance in the form of grants or loans shall not be considered good cause.

 To be effective, all proposed amendments must be signed by the person with signature authority for each party.

 VII. EFFECTIVE DATE

 This Order is effective on the date the agreement has been signed by both parties.

 VIII. TERMINATION OF THE AGREED ORDER

 Upon completion by SPU of the actions identified in Section IV of this Agreed Order and issuance of a Notice of Compliance by Ecology, the requirements of this Agreed Order shall be deemed to be fulfilled and shall have no further effect on SPU.

 IX. ENFORCEMENT

 Failure to comply with this Agreed Order may result in the issuance of civil penalties of up to $10,000 per day or other actions, whether administrative or judicial, to enforce the terms of this Agreed Order. SPU reserves the right to appeal Ecology's decision to seek penalties and the amount of any penalties sought.

 X. THIRD PARTY RIGHT TO APPEAL

 By signing this Agreed Order, the City of Seattle may not appeal this Agreed Order, however, a third party may.

 A party other than the City of Seattle has a right to appeal this Order to the Pollution Control Hearing Board (PCHB) within 30 days of the date of receipt of this Order. The appeal process is governed by Chapter 43.21B RCW and Chapter 371-08 WAC. "Date of receipt" is defined in RCW 43.21B.001(2).

 To appeal you must do the following within 30 days of the date of receipt of this Order:

 File your appeal and a copy of this Order with the PCHB (see addresses below). Filing means actual receipt by the PCHB during regular business hours.

 Serve a copy of your appeal and this Order on Ecology in paper form - by mail or in person. (See addresses below.) E-mail is not accepted.

 You must also comply with other applicable requirements in Chapter 43.21B RCW and Chapter 371-08 WAC.

 Your appeal alone will not stay the effectiveness of this Order. Stay requests must be submitted in accordance with RCW 43.21B.320.
