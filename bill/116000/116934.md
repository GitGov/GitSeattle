 SECTION 101

 TITLE, PURPOSE AND SCOPE

 101.1 Title. This subtitle shall be known as the "Seattle Building Code," may be so cited, and is referred to herein as "this code."

 101.2 Scope. The provisions of this code apply to the construction, alteration, moving, demolition, repair and occupancy of any building or structure within the City. See Chapter 32 for regulation of structures located on, over or under public property or a public right of way.

 Exceptions:

 1. Detached one- and two-family dwellings and multiple single-family dwellings (townhouses) not more than three stories above grade plane in height with a separate means of egress and their accessory structures shall comply with the International Residential Code.

 2. This code does not apply to public utility towers and poles, mechanical equipment not specifically regulated in this code, construction equipment and structural components thereof, and hydraulic flood control structures.

 101.3 Applicability of Seattle Building Code. A building permit application shall be considered under the Seattle Building, Mechanical, Fuel Gas, Energy, Stormwater and Grading codes in effect on the date a valid and fully complete building permit application is submitted or on a date as otherwise required by law.

 101.3.1 Complete building permit applications. A building permit application is complete if the building official determines it meets the requirements of Sections 106.5.1 through 106.5.2.6, and the application shall include, without limitation, the construction documents for the architectural and structural components of the building, except that if the building official allows an application for a portion of a building, the application shall include at least the structural frame for the entire building.

 101.3.2 Phased permits. Permits for portions of buildings issued according to Section 106.6.4 shall be considered under the codes in effect when a building permit application for the building is complete according to Section 101.3.1.

Additions, alterations, repairs, and changes of occupancy or character of occupancy in all buildings and structures shall comply with the provisions for new buildings and structures, except as otherwise provided in Chapter 34 of this code.

The purpose of this code is to provide minimum standards to safeguard life or limb, health, property and public welfare by regulating and controlling the design, construction, quality of materials, occupancy, location and maintenance of all buildings and structures within the City and certain equipment specifically regulated herein. The purpose of this code is to provide for and promote the health, safety and welfare of the general public, and not to create or otherwise establish or designate any particular class or group of persons who will or should be especially protected or benefited by the terms of this code.

 101.6 Internal consistency. Where in any specific case, different sections of this code specify different materials, methods of construction or other requirements, the most restrictive governs. Where there is a conflict between a general requirement and a specific requirement, the specific requirement is applicable.

 101.7 Referenced codes and standards. The codes and standards referenced in this code are considered part of this code to the extent prescribed by each such reference. Where differences occur between provisions of this code and referenced codes and standards, the provisions of this code apply, except that nothing in this Code limits the effect of any provision of the Grading Code, Stormwater Code, or Regulations for Environmentally Critical Areas.

 101.8 Appendices. Provisions in the appendices of the International Building Code do not apply unless specifically adopted.

 101.9 Metric units. Wherever in this code there is a conflict between metric units of measurement and U.S. customary units, the U.S. customary units govern.

The stop work order shall identify the violation and may prohibit work or other activity on the site.

 103.3.1 Service of stop work order. The building official may serve the stop work order by posting it in a conspicuous place at the site, if posting is physically possible.

 103.4.1 Service of notice of occupancy violation. The notice shall be served by personal service or regular first class mail addressed to the last known address of the occupant of the premises or any person causing such occupancy.

 103.4.2 Compliance with notice of occupancy violation. Any person occupying the building or structure shall discontinue the occupancy by the date specified in the notice of the building official, or shall make the building or structure, or portion thereof, comply with the requirements of this code; provided, however, that in the event of an unsafe building, Section 102 may apply.

 103.5 Civil penalties. Any person violating or failing to comply with the provisions of this code shall be subject to a cumulative civil penalty in an amount not to exceed $500 per day for each violation from the date the violation occurs or begins until compliance is achieved. In cases where the building official has issued a notice of violation, the violation will be deemed to begin, for purposes of determining the number of days of violation, on the date compliance is required by the notice of violation.

 103.6 Enforcement in Municipal Court. Civil actions to enforce Title 22 of the Seattle Municipal Code (SMC) shall be brought exclusively in Seattle Municipal Court, except as otherwise required by law or court rule. In any civil action for a penalty, the City has the burden of proving by a preponderance of the evidence that a violation exists or existed; the issuance of a notice of violation or of an order following a review by the building official is not itself evidence that a violation exists.

 103.7 Judicial review. Because civil actions to enforce Title 22 SMC must be brought exclusively in Seattle Municipal Court pursuant to Section 103.6, orders of the building official including Notices of Violation issued under this chapter are not subject to judicial review pursuant to Chapter 36.70C RCW.

 103.8 Alternative criminal penalty. Anyone who violates or fails to comply with any notice of violation or order issued by the building official pursuant to this code or who removes, mutilates, destroys or conceals a notice issued or posted by the building official shall, upon conviction thereof, be punished by a fine of not more than $5000 or by imprisonment for not more than 365 days, or by both such fine and imprisonment for each separate violation. Each day's violation shall constitute a separate offense.

 103.9 Additional relief. The building official may seek legal or equitable relief to enjoin any acts or practices and abate any condition when necessary to achieve compliance.

 103.10 Administrative Review.

 103.10.1 Administrative review by the building official. Applicants may request administrative review by the building official of decisions or actions pertaining to the administration and enforcement of this code. Requests shall be addressed to the building official.

The review will be performed by three or more members of the Construction Codes Advisory Board, chosen by the Board Chair. The Chair shall consider the subject of the review and members' expertise when selecting members to conduct a review. The decision of the review panel is advisory only; the final decision is made by the building official.

 103.11 Recording of notices. The building official may record a copy of any order or notice with the Department of Records and Elections of King County.

 103.12 Appeal to Superior Court. Final decisions of the Seattle Municipal Court on enforcement actions authorized by Title 22 and this code may be appealed pursuant to the Rules for Appeal of Decisions of Courts of Limited Jurisdiction.

 GENERAL BUILDING HEIGHT AND AREA LIMITATIONS

 503.1 General. The building height,  number of stories above grade plane,  and area shall not exceed the limits specified in Table 503 based on the type of construction as determined by Section 602 and the occupancies as determined by Section 302 except as modified hereafter. Each portion of a building separated by one or more fire walls complying with Section 706 shall be considered to be a separate building.

 Interpretation I503a: An unenclosed and uncovered roof deck shall not be considered a story for the purpose of determining the number of stories in a building.

 Interpretation I503b: In stepped or terraced buildings, the number of stories is the number counted from the first story above grade plane of the lowest building segment to the top story of the highest building segment. For purposes of this interpretation, portions of buildings divided by fire walls shall be considered separate buildings.

 503.1.1 Special industrial occupancies. Buildings and structures designed to house special industrial processes that require large areas and unusual building heights to accommodate craneways or special machinery and equipment, including, among others, rolling mills; structural metal fabrication shops and foundries; or the production and distribution of electric, gas or steam power, shall be exempt from the building height and area limitations of Table 503.

 503.1.2 Buildings on same lot. Two or more buildings on the same lot shall be regulated as separate buildings or shall be considered as portions of one building if the building height of each building and the aggregate building area of the buildings are within the limitations of Table 503 as modified by Sections 504 and 506. The provisions of this code applicable to the aggregate building shall be applicable to each building.

 503.1.3 Type I construction. Buildings of Type I construction permitted to be of unlimited tabular building heights and areas are not subject to the special requirements that allow unlimited area buildings in Section 507 or unlimited building height in Sections 503.1.1 and 504.3 or increased building heights and areas for other types of construction.

 LOAD COMBINATIONS

 ***

 1605.2 Load combinations using strength design or load and resistance factor design.

 Interpretation I1605: The lateral pressure on basement and retaining walls due to earthquake motions, as required in Section 1803.5.12, is permitted to be considered as an earthquake load E for the purposes of use in load combinations.

 1605.2.1 Basic load combinations. Where strength design or load and resistance factor design is used, structures and portions thereof shall resist the most critical effects from the following combinations of factored loads:

 1.4(D+F) (Equation 16-1)

 1.2(D + F + T) + 1.6(L + H) +

 0.5(Lr or S or R) (Equation 16-2)

 1.2D+ 1.6(Lr or S or R) + (f1L or 0.8W) (Equation 16-3)

 1.2D+ 1.6W+ f1L + 0.5(Lr or S or R) (Equation 16-4)

 1.2D+ 1.0E+ f1L + f2S (Equation 16-5)

 0.9D+ 1.6W+ 1.6H (Equation 16-6)

 0.9D+ 1.0E+ 1.6H (Equation 16-7)

 where:

 f1 = 1 for floors in places of public assembly, for live loads in excess of 100 pounds per square foot (4.79 kN/m2), and for parking garage live load, and = 0.5 for other live loads.

 f2 = 0.7 for roof configurations (such as saw tooth) that do not shed snow off the structure, and = 0.2 for other roof configurations.

 Exception: Where other factored load combinations are specifically required by the provisions of this code, such combinations shall take precedence.

 1605.2.2 Flood loads. Where flood loads, Fa, are to be considered in the design, the load combinations of Section 2.3.3 of ASCE 7 shall be used.
