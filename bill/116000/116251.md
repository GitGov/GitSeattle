 WHEREAS, SPU has completed the first of those studies, finding that the production, use and recycling or disposal of both plastic and paper disposable shopping bags have significant adverse impacts on the environment; and

 WHEREAS, to discourage and decrease the use of disposable shopping bags in the city, it is necessary to regulate such use; and

 Attachment A: Green Fee Implementation Actions

 July 16, 2008 Version #22 t

 ATTACHMENT A: GREEN FEE IMPLEMENTATION ACTIONS

 The following actions shall be completed to assist implementation of the disposable shopping bag green fee. The deadlines for reporting action results to the Environment, Emergency Management, and Utilities Committee are shown in parentheses after each action. SPU shall:

 A. Conduct an intensive public education and outreach campaign starting at least 90 days before the effective date of the green fee. SPU shall incorporate within that campaign, messages about the importance of keeping reusable bags clean and properly containing meat to prevent leakage (report on outreach strategy due by September 30, 2008).

 B. Develop a proposal for minimizing impacts of the green fee on low-income customers and submit a written report to the Environment, Emergency Management, and Utilities Committee. The proposal should evaluate:

 1. Making free bags available at the checkout stand during 2009 for low-income customers who do not have enough reusable bags to carry their purchases.

 2. Options such as a City-issued punchcard available for 2009 that pre-pays the green fee for a certain number of shopping bags when low-income customers bring too few reusable bags.

 3. Methods to minimize the cost to food banks if the projected reduction in use of disposable bags from groceries, convenience stores and drug stores reduces the number of disposable shopping bags donated to food banks.

 4. Ways that SPU will work with low-income service providers including food banks, Seattle Housing Authority and other non-profit housing providers to distribute information and multiple reusable bags to low-income households (November 25, 2008).

 C. Develop business record-keeping and reporting requirements that are as simple as possible to reduce the administrative burden on businesses (December 1, 2008).

 D. Assess the additional cost to businesses of implementing the green fee and submit a written report (December 1, 2009).

 E. Evaluate the potential benefits and costs of extending the green fee to all retail businesses and submit a written report (December 1, 2009).

 F. Evaluate the effectiveness of measures taken to address impacts on low-income customers and submit a written report (December 1, 2009).
