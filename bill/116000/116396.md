 AN ORDINANCE relating to the levy of property taxes; fixing the rates and/or amounts of taxes to be levied, and levying the same upon all taxable property, both real and personal, in the City of Seattle, to finance the departments and activities of City government and to provide for the general obligation bond interest and redemption requirements for the year beginning on the first day of January 2009; and ratifying and confirming certain prior acts.

 BE IT ORDAINED BY THE CITY OF SEATTLE AS FOLLOWS:

 Section 1. General Municipal and Firefighters' Pension.

 A. (i) There is hereby levied a tax on all taxable property, both real and personal, within the City of Seattle and subject to taxation under the laws of the State of Washington in the amount of Four Hundred Eighty-three Million Five Hundred Sixty-one Thousand Four Hundred Fifteen Dollars ($483,561,415), which is calculated as $3.60 per thousand dollars of estimated assessed value of such property. This tax is levied for the purpose of raising revenue to finance the various departments and activities of the municipal government of the City of Seattle for the fiscal (calendar) year 2009. The following sentence is provided for information only. This levy has been calculated at the following dollar rates per thousand dollars of assessed value: Three Dollars and Thirty-seven and one- half cents ($3.375) for general municipal purposes as allowed by RCW 84.52.043 (which includes up to Twenty-two and one-half cents ($0.225) for the Firemen's Pension Fund as allowed by RCW 41.16.060); and Twenty-two and one-half cents ($0.225) for general municipal purposes and the Firemen's Pension Fund as allowed by RCW 41.16.060. This levy includes an amount of Three Million Seven Hundred Four Thousand Seven Hundred Twenty-two Dollars ($3,704,722) for low-income housing that is not restricted to serving very low-income households, in accordance with Ordinance 120823; an amount of Sixteen Million Six Hundred Eighty-four Thousand Dollars ($16,684,000) for educational and developmental services in accordance with Ordinance 121529; an amount of Nineteen Million Nine Hundred Thousand Dollars ($19,900,000) for firefighting, life-safety and other emergency response facilities in accordance with Ordinance 121230; an amount of Thirty-seven Million Three Hundred Eighty-six Thousand Six Hundred Sixty-five Dollars ($37,386,665), for transportation purposes in accordance with Ordinance 122232; an amount of Twelve Million Five Hundred Thousand Dollars ($12,500,000) for basic infrastructure improvements to the Pike Place Market in accordance with Ordinance 122737; and an amount of Twenty-four Million Two Hundred Fifty Thousand Dollars ($24,250,000) for parks purposes in accordance with Ordinance 122749.

 (ii) In addition, there is also hereby levied a tax on all taxable property, both real and personal, within the City of Seattle and subject to taxation under the laws of the State of Washington, in the amount of Eight Million Five Hundred Eighty Thousand Nine Hundred Ninety-two Dollars ($8,580,992), such tax being levied for the purpose of financing affordable housing for very low-income households pursuant to RCW 84.52.105 and pursuant to Ordinance 120823, which tax levy shall be outside of and in addition to the limitations in RCW 84.52.043.

 B. If the total of the amounts of taxes stated in subsections 1.A (i) and (ii), or the total of the tax rate stated in subsection 1.A (i) and the rate necessary to generate the amount of taxes stated in subsection 1.A (ii), would be in excess of any maximum allowed by law, then such taxes shall be reduced to the maximum amount allowed. The maximum amount allowed by law includes the maximum amount of regular property taxes approved by vote of the people of the City of Seattle pursuant to RCW 84.55.050. For purposes of this subsection, the maximum amount of regular property taxes is determined by the King County Assessor as follows. First, the Assessor determines the amount of regular City property taxes that could have been levied for collection in 2009 had the voters approved none of the levy lid lift measures submitted pursuant to RCW 84.55.050 and Ordinances 120823, 121529, 121230, 122232, 122737 and 122749. This amount is computed as One Hundred One percent (101%) of the general purpose regular property taxes levied for collection in 2008, plus the levy for tax refunds authorized by RCW 84.68.040 and RCW 84.55.070; plus the allowance authorized by RCW 84.55.010 for new construction, increases in assessed value due to construction of electronic generation wind turbine facilities classified as personal property, improvements to property, and any increase in the assessed value of state-assessed property . Then, to that total amount is added the six dollar amounts set forth in the last sentence of subsection 1.A (i), authorized for 2009 collection in the approvals given by the voters of the City pursuant to RCW 84.55.050 and those enumerated ordinances, plus the dollar amount set forth in subsection 1.A (ii).

 Section 2. Voter-approved excess taxes for bonds. In addition, a further tax is hereby levied to raise revenue to provide for the interest on and redemption of voter-approved general obligation bonds for the fiscal year 2009 in the amount of Eighteen Million Two Hundred Forty-eight Thousand One Hundred Forty-eight Dollars ($18,248,148). This tax is applicable to all taxable property within the City of Seattle.

 Section 3. Severability. The several provisions of this ordinance are declared to be separate and severable and the invalidity of any clause, sentence, paragraph, subdivision, section, subsection, or portion of this ordinance, or the invalidity of the application thereof to any person, property, or circumstance, shall not affect the validity of the remainder of this ordinance or the validity of its application to other persons, property, or circumstances.

 Section 4. Any act pursuant to the authority of this ordinance taken after the passage of this ordinance is hereby ratified and confirmed.

 Section 5. Effective date. This ordinance shall take effect and be in force thirty (30) days from and after its approval by the Mayor, but if not approved and returned by the Mayor within ten (10) days after presentation, it shall take effect as provided by Municipal Code Section 1.04.020.

 Passed by the City Council the _______day of _________________, 2008, and signed by me in open session in authentication of its passage this _______ day of _________________, 2008.
