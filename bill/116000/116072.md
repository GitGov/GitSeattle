 WHEREAS, it is a constitutional requirement, a requirement of Chapter 10.101 RCW and a public purpose that each person charged with a crime punishable by incarceration or involved in certain other proceedings that may result in loss of liberty or loss of fundamental rights, be provided with effective legal representation in order to ensure equal justice under law without regard to his or her ability to pay; and

 WHEREAS, in July 2007, the City requested proposals from nonprofit corporations to provide indigent public defense services for the period from January 1, 2008 through December 31, 2010; and
