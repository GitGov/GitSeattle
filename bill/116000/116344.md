 NOW, THEREFORE,

 BE IT ORDAINED BY THE CITY OF SEATTLE AS FOLLOWS:

 Section 1. The Mayor or the Director of the Office of Economic Development ("OED Director") is authorized, on behalf of The City of Seattle, to issue a non-recourse promissory note ("Note") in the principal amount not to exceed Three Million Seven Hundred Eighty- five Thousand Dollars ($3,785,000), based on the form attached as Exhibit C to this ordinance, and with such modifications, additions or amendments as HUD may require or the Mayor or the OED Director may deem necessary or advisable to carry out the purposes of this Ordinance. The Note shall provide for a schedule of maturities of principal approximately as stated in Exhibit A, with such modifications and amendments as HUD may require or the Mayor or OED Director deem necessary or advisable to carry out the purposes of this Ordinance. The Mayor or OED Director is further authorized, on behalf of the City, to lend and cause the disbursement of the Note proceeds to Lake Dell, Inc., a Washington corporation doing business as Alpha Cine Labs, or a substitute entity approved by the Mayor or OED Director ("Obligor"). The Mayor or OED Director is further authorized, on behalf of The City of Seattle, to cause there to be drawn from the federal treasury and deposited in the Special Purpose Grants Fund, No. 17820, companion Brownfields Economic Development Initiative ("BEDI") Grant funds in the amount of Seven Hundred Fifty- seven Thousand Dollars ($757,000), and pursuant to the appropriation in Section 4 of this ordinance, to cause the disbursement of such amount for the purpose of financing project costs. A portion of such BEDI Grant funds may constitute a loan to Obligor on the terms described in Section 7.16 of the Loan Agreement authorized under Section 2 of this Ordinance, with such modifications of terms as HUD may require or the OED Director may deem appropriate to carry out the intent of this ordinance. The OED Director shall determine the allocation of BEDI funds among loan loss reserves, grant for project costs, and any loan for project costs, based on the final project budget and the OED Director's determination that payment obligations on the BEDI loan would not cause the projected debt service coverage ratio to fall below 1.2. The amount of such BEDI Grant funds is based on the ratio of the maximum amount of the Section 108 loan ($3,785,000) to the maximum amount available under the City's Contract (i.e., $10,000,000).

 Section 2. The Mayor or the OED Director is authorized, on behalf of The City of Seattle, to execute, deliver, administer and cause to be performed: (1) a Loan Agreement with the Obligor based on the form attached as Exhibit B to this ordinance and the Project Description attached as Attachment B to Exhibit B, with such additions and modifications as HUD may require or the Mayor or OED Director may deem necessary or advisable to carry out the purposes of this ordinance; and (2) such amendments and related documents as the Mayor or OED Director may deem necessary or advisable to carry out the purposes of this ordinance. The Section 108 loan shall be secured by a deed of trust against the property being financed with such loan ("Property"); liens against Obligor's machinery, equipment and accounts receivable; a deed of trust against residential property owned by W. Donald Jensen, the principal shareholder of Obligor, and his spouse; and an unconditional guaranty of payment and performance from W. Donald Jensen, signed by his spouse to confirm that it obligates the marital community. Such security shall be in form and content acceptable to the OED Director. The OED Director is authorized to subordinate the security and the City's rights under loan documents on such terms as the OED Director may deem appropriate to facilitate other financing for the project. The OED Director may agree to terms of a guaranty or other security documents, or both, providing for release or modification based on such criteria as the Director determines are reasonably calculated to ensure that remaining security will be adequate.

 Section 3. The Loan Agreement shall provide, consistent with HUD regulations, that the Obligor shall take affirmative steps to assure that minority and women's business enterprises are used when possible, that Obligor shall maintain records of those steps, and that nothing in the Loan Agreement shall be construed to require or authorize any discrimination or preferential treatment contrary to applicable law.

 Section 4. To the extent that BEDI Grant funds are received by the City in the Special Purpose Grants Fund in excess of amounts thereof required for prior appropriations, the appropriation for the following in the 2008 Budget is increased from the fund shown, as follows:

 Fund Department Budget Control Level Amount

 Special Office of Economic OED - HUD Special $757,000 Purpose Development Grants (6XD20) (BEDI Grant Grants Fund funds) (17820)

 Section 5. The Mayor or OED Director may require the Obligor to pay a loan origination fee of no more than one percent (1%) of the loan amount, i.e., no more than Thirty-seven Thousand Eight Hundred Fifty Dollars ($37,850), which shall be deposited in the Special Purpose Grants Fund. The OED Director is authorized to cause all or a portion of such fee to be applied to legal and other costs related to the administration of the transaction authorized by this ordinance, that are not paid by Obligor pursuant to the Loan Agreement; and/or applied to payment of expenses incurred in the administration of any federally funded economic development loan projects or programs administered by the OED Director. To the extent that such loan origination fee is received by the City in the Special Purpose Grants Fund in excess of amounts therein required for prior appropriations, the appropriation for the following in the 2008 Budget is increased from the fund shown, as follows:

 Fund Department Budget Control Level Amount

 Special Office of Economic OED - HUD Special $37,850 Purpose Development Grants (6XD20) (loan Grants Fund origination (17820) fee)

 The appropriation in this section is made to meet actual necessary expenditures of the City for which insufficient appropriation has been made due to causes which could not reasonably have been foreseen at the time of the making of the 2008 budget, in accordance with RCW 35.32A.060.

 Section 6. The Director of the Human Services Department ("HSD Director") is authorized to (a) further amend the City's 2005-2008 Consolidated Plan, including the 2008 Table of Proposed Projects, to reflect the transactions contemplated by this ordinance and (b) provide OED with technical assistance to ensure compliance with Community Development Block Grant ("CDBG") regulations applicable to the Section 108 loan program. The Mayor, OED Director and the HSD Director are authorized to take such other actions as they shall deem necessary to implement the actions authorized by this ordinance.

 Section 7. This ordinance is not intended to create, and shall not be construed to create, any contractual or otherwise binding obligation upon, or commitment by, the City for the benefit of Obligor or any other party. The commitments to the Obligor authorized by this ordinance, subject to the limitations herein and under applicable law, shall become effective only if and when the agreements authorized hereby are duly executed and delivered by the City and other necessary parties.

 Section 8. Unexpended and unencumbered appropriations in the 2008 adopted budget that are authorized in this ordinance are hereby carried over for expenditure in 2009 and future budget years until spent or expressly abandoned by ordinance.

 Section 9. Any act pursuant to the authority of this ordinance taken after the passage of this ordinance is hereby ratified and confirmed. If any provision of this ordinance is determined to be invalid or unenforceable the remainder shall nonetheless remain in full force and effect.

 Section 10. This ordinance shall take effect and be in force thirty (30) days from and after its approval by the Mayor, but if not approved and returned by the Mayor within ten (10) days after presentation, it shall take effect as provided by Municipal Code Section 1.04.020.

 C. The United States Department of Housing and Urban Development ("HUD") has agreed, subject to certain conditions, to guarantee a non- recourse note or notes (collectively, as supplemented or amended from time to time, and together with any replacements thereof issued by the City and guaranteed by HUD pursuant to the HUD Contract described below, the "City Note") issued by City to fund the Loan (described in Section 1.1 below), in accordance with Section 108 of the Housing and Community Development Act of 1974, as amended (such Act and the federal regulations promulgated thereunder are hereinafter collectively called the "Act").

The Application, HUD Contract, Letter Agreements and Custodial Agreement are incorporated herein by this reference. Unless the context otherwise requires, capitalized terms used herein and not otherwise defined herein shall have the meanings assigned to them in the HUD Contract or City Note, as applicable.

 D. The Office of Economic Development of the City ("OED") is responsible within The City of Seattle for making, subject to City Council approval, loans of funds obtained from HUD by pledges of Community Development Block Grant ("CDBG") funds to be made available to the City by HUD, pursuant to the Act. Unless the City otherwise notifies Obligor, in writing, OED shall be responsible for performance of the obligations of the City under this Agreement and the other Loan Documents, and for oversight of performance of such agreements by Obligor, and references hereinafter made to the City shall be deemed to mean the City, acting through OED. The Director of OED, or his or her duly authorized designee, and any official of the City succeeding to the functions of such Director, is referred to herein as the "OED Director."

 E. The Loan shall be evidenced by this Agreement and by Obligor's Promissory Note ("Obligor Note") in the form attached hereto as Attachment C and hereby incorporated by reference, and together with Obligor's other obligations under the Loan Documents, secured by: (i) a Deed of Trust, Assignment of Leases and Rents and Security Agreement with Fixture Filing in form and content acceptable to the City (as supplemented or amended from time to time, the "Deed of Trust") on the Property executed by the LLC as well as Obligor; (ii) a lien against Obligor's machinery and equipment pursuant to a Security Agreement in the form and content acceptable to the City (as supplemented or amended from time to time, the "Machinery and Equipment Lien"); (iii) a lien against Obligor's accounts receivable pursuant to a Security Agreement in the form and content acceptable to the City (as supplemented or amended from time to time, the "Accounts Receivables Lien"); and (iv) a deed of trust in form and content acceptable to the City (as supplemented or amended from time to time, the "Residential Mortgage") on residential property owned by W.

Where the context so requires, to the extent that the Loan Documents provide that Obligor's obligations or duties thereunder are determined by reference to any terms or provisions of documents incorporated by reference in any of the Loan Documents, any reference to the "Loan Documents" shall include such terms or provisions.

 F. Obligor's obligations under this Agreement and the other Loan Documents shall be unconditionally guaranteed under a Guaranty (defined in Section 1.4(b) of this Agreement), executed by W. Donald Jensen, and by his spouse to confirm that the marital community is obligated thereon, and delivered to the City as a material inducement to the City's agreement to make the Loan in accordance with this Agreement.

 G. The portion of principal on the City Note that is scheduled to become due and payable in any year, equal to that portion of principal on the Obligor Note scheduled to become due in the same year, is referred to as the "Corresponding Advance" to such portion of principal on the Obligor Note, and the aggregate of all Corresponding Advances is referred to as the "Corresponding Portion" of the City Note.

 H. The City will transfer funds in the maximum aggregate amount of Seven Hundred Fifty-seven Thousand Dollars ($757,000), derived solely from a Brownfields Economic Development Initiative ("BEDI") Grant from HUD, to the Custodian, for deposit into one or more accounts to be established by the Custodian at Closing (collectively, the "BEDI Accounts") for disbursement to cover non-construction development soft costs of the Project, with the remainder to be held as loan loss reserves .

The Obligor hereby irrevocably assigns all of its right, title and interest, if any, in funds deposited in the subaccounts of the Loan Repayment Account, Loan Repayment Investment Account and BEDI Accounts related to the Obligor Note, to the Custodian and the City, and shall have no residual interest in any portion of such Reserves.

 (b) Transfers Authorized; Crediting Payments on Obligor Note. The Custodian is hereby irrevocably authorized to transfer from the Loan Repayment Investment Account to the Loan Repayment Account on each Obligor Note Payment Date, funds in the full amount due on the Obligor Note on each such date. The Custodian is then authorized and directed to apply funds in the Loan Repayment Account to the timely payment of amounts due on the Corresponding Portion of the City Note. The Obligor further agrees that upon direction of the City, the Custodian may apply funds in the BEDI Accounts to make any payments on the Corresponding Portion for which there are insufficient funds in the Loan Repayment Account as a result of failure by Obligor to pay funds to the Custodian for deposit therein as required hereunder, but no application of any funds in any account to payments on the Obligor Note shall waive or reduce any such required payments from Obligor. Obligor's monthly installment payments into the Loan Repayment Account shall not constitute payments under the Obligor Note. Obligor shall be credited with the payment of interest and principal on the Obligor Note only when and solely to the extent that funds on deposit and/or transferred to the Loan Repayment Account under this Section 4.5(b), not including any amounts in the BEDI Grant Reserve Account, are applied to the payment of the Corresponding Portion of the City Note, except that if all amounts necessary to pay all amounts owing on the Obligor Note are on deposit in the Loan Repayment Account on the final maturity date of the Obligor Note, such amounts shall be credited on such maturity date. The Custodian is further irrevocably authorized by Obligor to liquidate investments in the Loan Repayment Investment Account and BEDI Accounts, in the Custodian's discretion, and without liability for any loss on any such liquidation, for the purposes described in this Section 4.5(b). The authorization by Obligor in this Section 4.5(b) is in addition to, and not in limitation of, the authorization in Section 1.4 above.

 (c) Investment of Funds; Earnings Remain on Deposit. Funds in the Loan Repayment Account and BEDI Accounts shall be invested at the direction of City, but only in instruments that mature (or are redeemable without penalty) within six (6) months and in any event no later than five (5) Business Days before the next Obligor Note Payment Date, and that are guaranteed as to payment of principal by the United States Government, or in money market funds that invest solely in such instruments. All earnings in the Loan Repayment Account and BEDI Accounts shall remain therein until applied in accordance with this Agreement, or until all amounts owing under the Loan Documents have been paid in full, or in the case of the BEDI Accounts, until any earlier date when any right of the Obligor to have amounts in such Account applied for its benefit shall have terminated hereunder. When all amounts owing under the Loan Documents have been paid in full, then the remaining balance shall be disbursed to or upon the order of the City.

 (d) Late Charge. If any deposit required to be made into the Loan Repayment Account is not received within ten (10) days after the date when such deposit is due, in addition to additional interest required to be paid in accordance with the Obligor Note, Obligor agrees to pay a late charge equal to five percent (5.0%) of the amount past due, as compensation to the City and Custodian for the staff time and resources required to handle such delinquencies, and not as a penalty. Such late charges shall not be credited to the Loan Repayment Account, but shall be retained by the City and/or Custodian. Late charges under this Section are in addition to, and not in substitution for, the other remedies provided in the Loan Documents.

 4.6 Application of Payments. Any amounts to be applied to the Obligor Note in accordance with this Agreement shall be applied first to accrued interest on the Obligor Note, next to any premium then due, and the balance, if any, to reduction of principal.

Accordingly, Obligor agrees, represents and warrants that Obligor shall comply with all applicable requirements under HUD regulations for the CDBG program and under other laws and regulations applicable to loans of such federal funds, including without limitation those cited in this Section 5.7, and to comply with all of the provisions below, some of which extend beyond federal requirements:

Part 1.

Section 8.50 with regard to compliance with regulations under Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973.

 Obligor shall ensure compliance with Executive Order 11246, entitled "Equal Opportunity", as amended, and the regulations issued pursuant thereto, 41 C.F.R.

The "equal opportunity clause" set forth in 41 C.F.R. Section 60-1.4(a) is hereby incorporated by reference as though fully set forth, with Obligor as "Contractor" thereunder. Obligor shall cause the appropriate "equal opportunity clause" to be set forth in each "federally assisted construction contract" (as defined in 41 CFR Section 60-1.3, including subcontracts) for the Project, except as expressly exempted under 41 C.F.R. Part 60.

These requirements include, but are not limited to: language within each contract for construction work; payment of prevailing wages and fringe benefits; the submittal of various documents as evidence of compliance; withholding of funds; equal employment opportunity; and work hours.

 The requirements are defined in the: Davis-Bacon Act, 40 U.S.C. Section 3141 et seq.; Contract Work Hours and Safety Standards Act, 40 U.S.C. Section 3701 et seq.; Copeland Act (Anti-Kickback Act), 18 U.S.C. Section 874; the Fair Labor Standards Act, and regulations under such Acts, including 29 C.F.R. Parts 3 and 5. If under other

 applicable law or any other agreement with respect to the Project, minimum levels of wages or benefits are required, then Obligor shall ensure compliance with such levels, and if both Davis-Bacon Act requirements and any other such requirements shall apply, then Obligor shall ensure compliance with higher of the applicable levels.

 (g) Economic Opportunities for Low- and Very Low-Income Persons. Obligor shall comply, and cause all contractors and subcontractors to comply, with any and all applicable provisions of Section 3 of the Housing and Urban Development Act of 1968, as amended, 12 U.S.C. 1701u, the purpose of which is to ensure that employment and other economic opportunities generated by Federal financial assistance for housing and community development programs shall, to the greatest extent feasible, be directed toward low- and very low-income persons, particularly those who are recipients of government assistance for housing. Obligor shall comply, and shall require all contractors and subcontractors to comply, with all applicable provisions of regulations issued pursuant thereto by the Secretary of HUD and set forth in 24 C.F.R. Part 135, and with all applicable rules and orders of HUD issued thereunder.

Obligor represents, warrants and agrees that no residential tenants have been or will be displaced in connection with the Project and the Obligor has taken and shall take all reasonable steps to minimize the displacement of persons (families, individuals, businesses, nonprofit organizations, and farms) in connection with the Project. If the Obligor or its affiliate has acquired or entered into an agreement to acquire real property for the Project, then Obligor represents and warrants that prior to making an offer for such property, (1) Obligor or such affiliate clearly advised the owner in writing that it lacked the power of eminent domain and therefore was unable to acquire the property in the event negotiations failed to reach an amicable agreement, and (2) it informed the owner in writing of what Obligor or such affiliate believed to be the fair market value of the property. Obligor represents and warrants that Obligor has provided to City a complete and accurate list of all occupants of the Property as of the date that Obligor obtained site control, and Obligor shall provide a complete and accurate list of all persons occupying the Property at any time after site control and through the date of full occupancy after Project completion. Obligor shall comply fully, at Obligor's sole expense, with the City's Residential Anti-displacement and Relocation Assistance Plan ("RARAP"). If the Project involves the temporary and/or permanent displacement of persons, Obligor represents, warrants and agrees that Obligor has provided and shall provide, at a minimum, all relocation assistance required by 24 CFR Section 42; the federal Uniform Relocation Act and regulations thereunder, 49 CFR Part 24; 24 CFR Section 570.606 and any other applicable federal laws or regulations, and shall maintain complete and accurate records demonstrating such compliance. Obligor agrees that any determination by City of the amount of relocation assistance due to any person shall be final and binding upon Obligor, unless a different determination is made by HUD at the request of such person, in which case the HUD determination shall be final and binding on Obligor. Obligor agrees that the City may, at its option, provide relocation assistance directly to any person in connection with the Project and that any payment by the City for such person shall, at City's option, constitute an advance on the Loan, without any requirement for a draw request by, or consent of, Obligor. If, as a result of any such direct payments, the amount advanced by City shall exceed the maximum Loan amount stated herein, then the excess shall be immediately due and payable by Obligor to City, at City's demand. Obligor represents and warrants that, except as expressly stated in a relocation plan submitted by Obligor to City in connection with this Loan, no residential tenants have been required to vacate or will be required to vacate the Property permanently because of the Project. Obligor shall carry out the terms of any relocation plan approved by City, but the terms of any such plan shall not limit Obligor's obligations under this Loan Agreement or applicable laws or regulations, and no such approval by City shall be construed as a waiver or modification of any requirement of this Agreement or applicable laws or regulations.

 (i) Architectural Barriers. Obligor shall ensure that the Property, upon completion of the Project, shall comply with the applicable requirements of the Architectural Barriers Act of 1968 (see 42 U.S.C. Sections 4151-57), and shall comply with the Uniform Federal Accessibility Standards (Appendix A to 24 CFR part 40 for residential structures, and Appendix A to 41 CFR part 101-19, subpart 101-19.6, for general type buildings).

 (j) Flood Insurance Protection. If the Property is in a special flood hazard area as identified by the Federal Emergency Management Agency, then Obligor represents, warrants and agrees that flood insurance is and shall remain in effect, at Obligor's expense, in accordance with Section 102(a) of the Flood Disaster Protection Act of 1973 (42 U.S.C. Section 4001), so long as any amount is outstanding on the Obligor Note.

 (k) Records. Obligor shall maintain and make available to the City and HUD all records reasonably required to demonstrate compliance with all of the requirements of this Agreement, for at least four (4) years after full repayment of the Loan.

 (l) Disclosures. Obligor represents, warrants and agrees that it has provided to the City any and all disclosures required by the HUD Reform Act, 42 U.S.C. Section 3545, and regulations thereunder, 24 CFR Part 4; that it will provide timely updated disclosures to OH to the extent required by such act and regulations; and that all such disclosures are and shall be complete and accurate.

 (m) Prior Actions. Obligor represents and warrants that in all actions related to the Project to date Obligor and each of its affiliates involved in the acquisition of the Property or financing and development of the Project, each has complied with all requirements referred to in this Section 5.7.

 (n) Indemnity. Obligor shall indemnify and hold harmless the City from any loss, damage, expense, claim or demand resulting from Obligor's failure to comply with any federal requirement to be complied with pursuant to this Agreement or failure to maintain adequate records to demonstrate such compliance. This provision shall survive expiration of this Agreement.

 5.8 Reports. Obligor shall deliver to the City reports and information as City may require for purposes of monitoring and evaluating the performance of the Obligor, which may include copies of tenant certifications, rent rolls, leases, property management agreements and any other contracts affecting the Property.

 5.9 Liens or Claims of Liens. Obligor shall keep the Property and its interest therein free from liens and encumbrances of all kinds, superior or inferior to the Deed of Trust, except for those permitted pursuant to Section 2.4 above and any of the following:

 (a) Liens for property taxes on the Property not yet due and payable;

 (b) The rights of tenants as tenants only under leases entered into in the ordinary course of Obligor's operation of the Property and in accordance with this Agreement and the other Loan Documents, but only to the extent that such leases are subordinate to the liens of the Deed of Trust, to the Leases (as defined herein), and to any other material leases, which subordinate status shall be insured by endorsement to the City's title insurance policy, at Obligor's expense, within thirty (30) days of request to Obligor by the City; and

 (c) Liens subordinate to the lien of the Deed of Trust, Machinery and Equipment Lien, Accounts Receivable Lien and Residential Mortgage, created after the date of Closing with the prior written consent of the OED Director, in his or her discretion.

 If any claims of lien shall be asserted against the Property other than as permitted by this Section, Obligor, regardless of any action that City may otherwise be authorized to take, shall obtain a release and satisfaction of such lien claim, bond the lien claim, procure title insurance satisfactory to City protecting City from any loss relating to such lien claim, or otherwise provide to City assurances and security satisfactory to City that the lien claim will be paid or satisfied not later than ten (10) days after a judgment on the lien claim. Provided Obligor complies with the previous sentence, Obligor may in good faith contest any worker's or material supplier's lien in legal proceedings that will prevent enforcement of the lien claim and prevent foreclosure of the Property. If such a lien claim is not released or satisfied or a bond or other security satisfactory to City provided within forty-five (45) days of written request from City to Obligor, then the failure to do so shall allow the City to declare an Event of Default (as defined in Section 6.1 below) regardless of whether such lien claim is or is not superior to the Deed of Trust or other lien in favor of City.

 5.10 Political Activity. No portion of the Loan shall be used for any political activity or to further the election or defeat of any candidate for public office or to influence the approval or defeat of any ballot issue or legislation.

 5.11 Further Actions. Obligor will at any time and from time to time upon request of City take or cause to be taken any action, execute, acknowledge, deliver or record any further documents, opinions, or other instruments or obtain such additional insurance as City is required to do or obtain by HUD or other federal, state or county regulatory agency.

 5.12 Other Agreements. Obligor shall fully comply in a timely manner with all other agreements for the financing of the Project, including without limitation construction loans, bridge loans, and equity investment contracts ("Other Agreements"), and to the extent that any Other Agreements are the obligations of the LLC, the Obligor shall ensure that the LLC complies in a timely manner with the terms thereof, but nothing in this Section shall be construed to waive, or excuse noncompliance with, and provisions of this Agreement or any applicable City ordinances or permits.

 5.13 Payment of Compensation of Custodian. Obligor shall be responsible for and pay its prorata portion of the fees of the Custodian as provided under the Custodial Agreement. The Custodian's acceptance fee, prorated first annual fee and counsel fees and expenses shall be disbursed to Custodian from the Guaranteed Loan Funds Account at the time of initial Loan disbursement. Thereafter, Obligor shall promptly pay the Custodian's fees and expenses directly to the Custodian.

 5.14 Payment of Other Indebtedness. Obligor shall ensure the timely payment of principal, interest and all other amounts due on any other indebtedness or liability, whether or not owed by Obligor, now or hereafter secured by the Property or by other collateral for the Loan; provided, that nothing in this Section shall authorize Obligor to make any payment from any funds or assets pledged to the City hereunder.

 5.15 Transfer of Property. Obligor shall not cause or permit any transfer of the Property or any interest of Obligor therein, voluntary or involuntary, without the advance written consent of the City, except for the creation of liens, encumbrances or leases that are expressly permitted under the Loan Documents without the City's consent.

 ARTICLE VI - DEFAULT AND REMEDIES

 (h) Any default by Obligor of its obligations under the Certificate and Indemnity, giving effect to any applicable notice and cure provisions thereunder.

 6.2 Declaration of Event of Default. City's declaration of an Event of Default hereunder shall be made by notice to Obligor pursuant to Section 7.15 of this Agreement and shall be effective as provided therein.

No default or Event of Default shall exist under this Agreement or the Obligor Note until the same shall have been declared by the City or other party authorized to make such declaration; provided, that failure to declare, or delay in declaring, a default hereunder shall not constitute a waiver of any rights or remedies or excuse any failure by Obligor to strictly comply with its obligations under all of the Loan Documents.

 ARTICLE VII - MISCELLANEOUS

 7.1 No Waiver. No waiver of any noncompliance or breach by Obligor hereunder shall be implied from any failure by City to take action on account of such noncompliance or breach, and no express waiver shall affect any breach or noncompliance other than as specified in the waiver. Any waiver shall be operative only for the time and to the extent therein stated. Waivers of any covenant, term or condition contained herein shall not be construed as a waiver of any subsequent breach of the same covenant, term or condition. The consent or approval by City to, or of, any act by Obligor requiring further consent or approval shall not be deemed to waive or render unnecessary the consent or approval to, or of, any subsequent similar act.

 7.2 Successors and Assigns; Delegation to Custodian; Changes in Custodian and Custodial Agreement. This Agreement is made and entered into for the sole protection and benefit of City, HUD, and Obligor, their successors and assigns, and no other person or persons shall have any right of action hereunder. The terms hereof shall inure to the benefit of the successors and assigns of the parties hereto; provided, however, that the Obligor's interest hereunder cannot be assigned or otherwise transferred without the prior written consent of City. Obligor acknowledges and agrees that City may assign to HUD or any custodian or trustee for HUD any or all of City's rights under this Agreement and any of the Loan Documents and may direct that any payment or performance be provided directly to HUD or such custodian or trustee, whether or not the Obligor Note or this Agreement have been assigned. Obligor agrees that City may delegate to the Custodian the right to make demands and give directions on behalf of City under the Loan Documents, but that the scope of any such delegation shall be strictly limited to the terms of a written instrument duly signed on behalf of the City. Obligor further acknowledges that the Custodial Agreement may be modified or terminated, or a substitute Custodial Agreement executed, or a successor Custodian appointed, in each case without the consent of Obligor so long as the obligations of Obligor are not increased and the rights of the Obligor under the Loan Documents are not adversely affected in any material respect. Except for minor modifications to the Custodial Agreement not affecting Obligor, City agrees to give reasonable advance notice to the Obligor of any action as described in the preceding sentence, and agrees in each case to provide a copy of any modification or substitute Custodial Agreement to Obligor within fifteen (15) days after the execution thereof.

 7.3 No Defense Based on City Regulatory Actions. Obligor understands that (a) the operations of Obligor in the Property and elsewhere are subject to numerous laws, regulations, ordinances and permits, including those of City and other governmental bodies relating to land use, environmental hazards, and other regulatory matters, and (b) the modification, interpretation, application, or revocation of such laws, regulations, rules or permits could adversely

 affect economic return to Obligor from the Property. Obligor has conducted its own investigation and relied on the advice of its own counsel and experts as to all such matters in connection with Obligor's acquisition of the Property. Obligor acknowledges that by entering into this Agreement the City does not make, and that the City expressly disclaims, any representation or assurance whatever as to (1) the present or future status of the Property or the uses thereof under applicable laws or regulations, including those of the City; or (2) the availability, issuance or continuation of any permits, approvals, or interpretations of any kind that may be required or desired by Obligor or any other party in connection with the Property. Obligor agrees that notwithstanding any regulatory action or omission of City affecting Obligor or affecting the use or development of the Property (whether or not such action or omission shall be determined to be consistent with applicable law in any proceeding), no defense, offset or reduction of liability shall be available to Obligor, at law or in equity.

 7.4 Time. Time is of the essence of all provisions of the Loan Documents.

 7.5 Entire Agreement; Amendments. This Agreement, the other Loan Documents, and the documents, laws and regulations incorporated by reference herein constitute the entire agreement of the parties hereto with respect to the Loan and supersede any prior agreements or understandings, written or oral, with respect to the Loan. Obligor is not relying upon any promises, representations or understandings, written or oral, in entering into the Loan Documents, other than as expressly set forth in the Loan Documents. The obligations of Obligor under the Loan Documents are not conditioned upon, and shall not be affected by, any other agreement, understanding, performance or nonperformance by the City or any other party, and in any proceeding to enforce any of Obligor's obligations under the Loan Documents, Obligor shall not be entitled to assert, by way of excuse, offset, counterclaim, grounds for equitable relief, or otherwise, any actual or alleged action or inaction by or on behalf of the City except to the extent that any such action or inaction is expressly required of the City by, and is made a condition of Obligor's obligation by, the Loan Documents. No amendment, modification, or termination of any provisions of this Agreement or of any of the Loan Documents shall in any event be effective unless the same shall be in writing and signed by a duly authorized officer of City and by Obligor, and no such writing shall be construed to modify, waive, or affect the terms of the Loan Documents except to the extent that such document expressly so provides.

 7.6 Headings. The article and section headings in no way define, limit, extend or interpret the scope of this Agreement or of any particular article or section.

 7.7 Number and Gender; Joint and Several Obligations. When the context in which the words are used in this Agreement indicates that such is the intent, words in the singular number shall include the plural and vice-versa. References to any one gender shall also include the other gender if applicable under the circumstances. If Obligor comprises more than one person or entity, then each such person or entity shall be bound jointly and severally by this Agreement and the Loan Documents except to the extent otherwise expressly provided therein.

 7.8 Validity. In the event that any provision of this Agreement shall be held to be invalid, the same shall not affect in any respect whatsoever the validity of the remainder of this Agreement.

 7.9 Governing Law. This Agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of Washington, and The City of Seattle, except to the extent federal law applies.

 7.10 Survival. All agreements, representations and warranties made herein and in the Obligor Note shall survive the execution and delivery of this Agreement and of the Loan Documents and the making of the Loan hereunder and continue in full force and effect until the obligations of Obligor hereunder and the indebtedness evidenced by the Obligor Note have been fully paid and satisfied, and thereafter to the extent provided in the Loan Documents, regardless of whether the Obligor Note is surrendered or marked as canceled or paid in full.

 7.11 Venue and Forum. In the event that any legal action should be filed by either party against the other, the venue and forum for such action shall be the Superior Court of the State of Washington for the County of King.

 7.12 Attorney's Fees. In the event either party shall bring an action to enforce the terms and conditions of this Agreement, the prevailing party shall be entitled to recover all of its costs and expenses, including, but not limited to, reasonable attorney's fees as determined by the court.

 7.13 Duplicate Originals; Counterparts. This Agreement shall be executed in duplicate and each of the parties hereto shall receive an original. Each original shall constitute one and the same agreement. This Agreement may be executed in counterparts, and each such counterpart shall be deemed to be an original.

 7.14 Construction. The Loan Documents shall be construed so as to conform to the requirements of the HUD Contract and applicable federal laws and regulations. The Loan Documents are the product of negotiation between the parties and therefore shall not be construed strictly in favor of, or against, either party except as may be specifically provided in the Loan Documents with respect to particular provisions thereof.

 7.15 Notices; Administration by City. Any notice, demand or request required hereunder shall be given in writing at the addresses set forth below by personal service, by facsimile transmission, or by first class mail. The addresses may be changed by notice to the other party given in the same manner as provided above. Notices personally served or sent be facsimile shall be effective when actually received during normal business hours, and otherwise on the following Business Day.

 If to Obligor:

 If to City: Office of Economic Development City of Seattle P.O. Box 94708 Seattle, Washington 98124-4708 Attn: Director fax: (206) 684-0379

 Unless the City otherwise notifies Obligor, in writing, the OED shall be responsible for performance of the obligations of the City under this Agreement and the other Loan Documents, and for oversight of performance of such agreements by Obligor, and references hereinafter made to the City shall be deemed to mean the City, acting through OED.

 7.16 Additional Terms and Conditions

 The terms of this Section are intended to be in addition to, and not in substitution for, the terms and conditions set forth above, but in case of any irreconcilable conflict, the terms of this Section shall control. The inability of Obligor to satisfy any condition below for any reason shall not excuse any failure to comply in a timely manner with any other provision hereof. All provisions and conditions in this Section, and all other conditions to disbursement set forth in this Agreement, are for the benefit only of the City (and where applicable, HUD) and may be waived in whole or in part by the OED Director in his or her discretion, but no waiver shall be valid unless in writing signed by the OED Director.

 (a) Asset Management and Loan Monitoring. Obligor acknowledges that it has reviewed the City's Section 108 loan monitoring and asset management policies, and agrees to provide information and otherwise comply with the requirements of such policies. Furthermore, no later than February 1st of each year of the Loan, Obligor agrees to pay an asset management and loan monitoring fee, in the annual amount of Three Thousand Dollars ($3,000), until all amounts owing hereunder shall have been paid in full. It is anticipated that the loan monitoring and asset management duties will be performed by a private entity under contract to OED, and Obligor shall make payment directly to such private entity according to instructions provided by OED.

 (c) Release of Machinery and Equipment Lien. Prior to the end of the Loan term, Obligor and the City anticipate that Obligor will desire to release the City's Machinery and Equipment Lien. Upon request of Obligor, the City shall grant a release of its security interest in the Machinery and Equipment Lien, provided that (i) the Obligor is not then in default hereunder; (ii) the Obligor demonstrates to the satisfaction of the City that the Property's loan to value ratio does not exceed eighty percent (80%); and (iii) the Obligor demonstrates to the satisfaction of the City that the Property has a minimum 1.2 debt coverage service ratio. The loan to value ratio shall be computed by dividing the sum of the maximum principal amount of debt that may be secured by senior mortgages and deeds of trust, plus the principal amount of the Section 108 loan, by the total fair market value of the Property (as such value is determined by an appraisal approved by the City and prepared in the same year of the request for release). The 1.2 debt coverage service ratio requirement will be met if, in the year of the request, the Obligor has received, over the previous 12 months, net operating income from the Project in an amount of at least 1.2 times the actual debt service payable in that year on the Loan.

 (d) BEDI Grant and Loan. Subject to satisfaction by Obligor of all conditions to disbursement of Loan funds and compliance with all terms of this Loan Agreement, and subject to receipt by the City from HUD of BEDI funds not otherwise encumbered, the City shall cause disbursement of funds from the BEDI Accounts to finance Project costs. A portion of such BEDI Grant funds in an amount up to $__________ will constitute an unsecured loan to Obligor for purposes set forth on Attachment B ("BEDI Loan"), another portion, up to $__________, shall constitute a grant to finance Project Costs, and the remainder in the BEDI Accounts shall constitute a loan loss reserve for the sole benefit of the City. The BEDI Loan shall be evidenced by a promissory note in form satisfactory to Obligor ("BEDI Note"); shall bear no interest prior to delinquency, and shall require payment of one-tenth of the principal on each 15th day of July beginning 2009. Unless otherwise agreed by Obligor and City, BEDI funds shall be disbursed upon disbursement of Loan funds to Obligor. Any default in payment on the BEDI Loan shall be a breach of this Loan Agreement.

 IN WITNESS WHEREOF, Obligor and City have executed this Agreement as of the date first written above by and through their duly authorized representatives.

 FORM OF OBLIGOR NOTE

 VARIABLE/FIXED RATE PROMISSORY NOTE

 Seattle, Washington $3,785,000.00

 , 2008

 FOR VALUE RECEIVED, Lake Dell, Inc., a Washington corporation ("Obligor"), promises to pay to THE CITY OF SEATTLE, WASHINGTON ("Payee"), a Washington municipal corporation, or order, at the time or times provided herein, in lawful money of the United States, the sum of Three Million Seven Hundred Eighty-five Thousand Dollars ($3,785,000), with interest as provided herein.

 This Note is given to evidence a loan (the "Loan") made pursuant to the Loan Agreement dated as of __________________ (as supplemented or amended from time to time, the "Loan Agreement"), between the Obligor and the Payee. The funds used by the Payee to make the Loan have been obtained by Payee exclusively through the issuance of a note in the maximum commitment amount of $3,785,000 issued by the Payee, a copy of which note, with a schedule of Principal Due Dates as established by agreement of the City and HUD, is attached hereto as Exhibit 2 and incorporated herein by this reference (including any note issued in replacement therefor or for a portion thereof that includes the amount disbursed in order to fund the Loan evidenced hereby, the "City Note") pursuant to Section 108 of the Housing and Community Development Act of 1974, as amended (42 USC section5308) and 24 CFR 570.700, et seq., pursuant to which the Payee has entered into certain agreements, including, but not limited to, (a) with the United States Department of Housing and Urban Development ("HUD"), a Contract for Loan Guarantee Assistance (as it may be amended, the "HUD Contract") which contract incorporates by reference an Amended and Restated Master Fiscal Agency Agreement between HUD and JPMorgan Chase Bank (formerly known as The Chase Manhattan Bank), (b) with HUD, the BEDI Grant Agreement, B-04-BD-53- 0004, (which documents, as amended or amended from time to time, may be referred to collectively as the "Master Agreement"); and (c) with The Bank of New York Trust Company, N.A., an Indenture of Trust and Custodial Agreement (as it may be amended, the "Custodial Agreement"). The Obligor acknowledges and agrees that the Loan is made subject to all of the terms and conditions of the HUD Contract, Master Agreement and the City Note. Any capitalized terms not defined herein shall have the meanings provided in the City Note, the Loan Agreement, the Custodial Agreement or the Master Agreement as applicable.

 Each portion of principal outstanding on this Note shall bear interest from the date hereof at the rate applicable to the Corresponding Advance of principal under the City Note. For each installment of principal shown on Exhibit 1 hereto, the Corresponding Advance consists of an equal amount of principal on the City Note maturing in the same year as such installment of principal hereunder.

 Interest on this Note shall be due and payable on the 15th day of each calendar month next preceding each of the following dates if interest on the City Note is scheduled to become due and payable on such date: February 1, May 1, August 1, and November 1 of each year. The amount of interest payable on this Note on each such 15th day shall include interest accrued through such date and interest to accrue through the end of the month in which the interest payment becomes due under this Note. Interest on this Note also shall be due 15 days before any other date when interest shall become due on the Corresponding Portion of the City Note, and the amount of interest then payable on this Note shall include interest accrued and to accrue up to such date when interest shall become due on the City Note. Interest on the City Note is due and payable quarterly in arrears prior to the Conversion Date, on the Conversion Date, and semiannually thereafter. Principal on this Note is due and payable as set out on Exhibit 1 attached hereto and incorporated herein by this reference. Each date upon which principal or interest, or both, is due and payable hereunder is an "Obligor Note Payment Date."

 The principal amount due under this Note on each Obligor Note Payment Date shall be as set forth on the attached Exhibit 1, except to the extent such principal amount shall have been reduced by prepayment before such Obligor Note Payment Date as provided herein.

 On and after the Conversion Date (whether conversion to a fixed rate or rates is effected with the consent of the Obligor or otherwise), as more fully set forth in the City Note, each Corresponding Advance will accrue interest on the City Note at the fixed rate that the underwriters of the City Note, or securities representing participation interests in a pool of notes guaranteed by HUD, including the City Note, determine will enable them to sell the City Note or such participation interests under then prevailing market conditions as of the Conversion Date at one hundred percent (100%) of the aggregate amount thereof.

 Notwithstanding the foregoing, following the occurrence of any default hereunder or under the Loan Agreement, which default is not cured as permitted by the Loan Agreement, the outstanding principal balance of the Loan and this Note shall bear interest at the greater of the rate set as provided above or twelve percent (12%) per annum.

 Interest payable on or before the Conversion Date shall be calculated on the basis of a 360-day year and the actual number of days elapsed. Interest after the Conversion Date shall be calculated on the basis of a 360-day year consisting of twelve 30-day months.

 Anything herein to the contrary notwithstanding, all principal, interest, fees, costs and other charges that Obligor is obligated to pay in connection with this Note and the Loan shall be due and payable, in full, no later than July 15, 2028.

 This Note and other obligations of Obligor under the Loan Documents are secured by a Deed of Trust, Assignment of Leases and Rents, and Security Agreement with Fixture Filing (as supplemented or amended from time to time, the "Deed of Trust"), of even date herewith, from the Obligor for the benefit of the Payee. This Note and other obligations of Obligor under the Loan Documents are secured by other collateral, including without limitation security interests in the monies and investments held in certain Reserves established in accordance with the Loan Agreement and Master Agreement, and other collateral described in the Loan Agreement. This Note is further secured by a Guaranty of even date, executed and delivered by W. Donald Jensen, and by his spouse to confirm that the marital community is bound thereby.

 The principal hereof and any interest accrued hereon may be prepaid, subject in the case of principal to approval by HUD of prepayment by the Payee of an equal amount of each respective Corresponding Advance on the City Note, and provided, however, that any prepayment shall be applied to the principal installment(s) with latest maturity unless otherwise agreed in writing by the holder hereof and by HUD, and provided, further:

 (a) On or before the Conversion Date, this Note may be prepaid in whole or in part upon thirty (30) days prior written notice to the Payee and with, and only with, the consent of HUD. Any prepayment of the principal hereof shall be accompanied by all accrued interest thereon to the date of prepayment, and partial prepayments shall be credited against the principal amount last becoming due hereunder.

 (b) After the Conversion Date, Obligor shall give 90 days prior written notice of its intention to make any prepayment. No partial prepayment shall relieve the Obligor of the obligation to make any future payments due after the date of any prepayment. Obligor shall pay, in addition to the principal amount of any prepayment, a premium sufficient so that the total amount paid is sufficient to defease the Corresponding Advances on the City Note, as provided in the Master Agreement. If in the event of any prepayment, the Payee incurs any costs, expenses, fees, charges, premiums or losses, the Obligor shall pay such items upon demand in addition to the principal and interest due hereunder.

 After default, any payment by Obligor or any third party, or recovery from the disposition of any collateral, to the extent applied to amounts of principal that were not yet scheduled to fall due according to Exhibit 1, may be applied to such installments of principal as the holder hereof shall elect in its discretion, and shall be deemed a prepayment of such installment for purposes of the premium and other obligations set forth in paragraph (b) above, and Obligor shall pay all such amounts on demand, or the holder hereof may apply amounts so paid or collected to such other obligations, in the holder's discretion.

 In the event of any default by Obligor in any term or condition of this Note, the Loan Agreement, the Deed of Trust, the Certificate and Indemnity, or any other document executed in connection herewith, which default is not cured as permitted by the applicable document, the entire principal and accrued interest hereunder shall become immediately due and payable without notice or demand at the option of the holder of this Note. If the entire balance of principal and interest shall be declared due and payable after the Conversion Date, then the Obligor shall pay to the holder hereof, in addition to all other amounts owing, any further amount required in order that the holder is able to fully defease, solely from the payments by Obligor hereunder and without costs to such holder, all of the outstanding Corresponding Advances under the City Note. Obligor acknowledges that such additional amount, if any, is intended to protect the holder hereof from potential loss resulting from the enforcement of the terms hereof after default, and not as a penalty.

 If Obligor is in default under the provisions of this Note, the Loan Agreement, the Deed of Trust, the Certificate and Indemnity, or any other document executed in connection herewith and Payee or other holder of this Note commences any action to enforce collection hereof or foreclosure under any security document or guaranty given in connection herewith or therewith, the Obligor agrees to pay all costs and expenses incurred by Payee or such holder, including but not limited to Payee's or such holder's reasonable attorneys' fees.

 Demand, protest, and notice of demand and protest are hereby waived, and the Obligor, to the extent authorized by law hereby waives any and all homestead or other exemption rights which otherwise might apply to the obligation evidenced by this Note, and/or any property covered by any security document given in connection herewith. The Obligor executes this Note as a principal and not as a surety.

 ORAL AGREEMENTS, OR ORAL COMMITMENTS TO LEND MONEY, EXTEND CREDIT, OR TO FORBEAR FROM ENFORCING REPAYMENT OF A DEBT ARE NOT ENFORCEABLE UNDER WASHINGTON LAW.
