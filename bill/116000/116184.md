 AN ORDINANCE granting the Chinatown International District Business Improvement Area permission to construct and maintain a traditional Chinese gate in the Chinatown-International District, crossing over South King Street, at least 50 feet east of 5th Avenue South, for a ten-year term, renewable for two successive ten-year terms; specifying the conditions under which this permit is granted; providing for acceptance of the permit and conditions; and repealing Ordinance 122436.

 WHEREAS, the Historic Chinatown Gate Foundation, a 501(c)(3) non- profit organization, has constructed a traditional Chinese memorial gate spanning South King Street twenty feet east of 5th Avenue South; and

 WHEREAS, the gate is forty-four feet tall spanning South King Street and allows twenty feet of clearance for vehicles; and

 WHEREAS, the Chinatown International District Business Improvement Area ("CIDBIA"), a 501(c)(3) non-profit organization, has agreed to take responsibility for the maintenance and liability of the Chinatown Gate from the Historic Chinatown Gate Foundation; and

 WHEREAS, the traditional Chinese Gate will engender community pride, increase tourism by endowing Greater Seattle with a signature landmark in the Chinatown-International District, and add vitality and cultural interest in the District; and

 WHEREAS, pursuant to Seattle Municipal Code (SMC) Chapter 15.04.030, the Historical Chinatown Gate Foundation has submitted the information required for the Director of Transportation ("Director") to make a recommendation to Council on whether to grant or deny approval; and

 WHEREAS, the City's departments and utilities have no objections to the design of the gate and the International Special Review District Board has granted a Certificate of Approval for the final design on January 16, 2007, and all support the proposed gate and recommend the Council approve the permit; and

 WHEREAS, in making her recommendation, the Director considered the submitted plans and application materials, and recommended that the permit be granted; and

 WHEREAS, Ordinance 122436 was passed by City Council on July 16, 2007 granting a term permit to the non-profit CIDBIA to construct and maintain a traditional Chinese gate as described above; and

 WHEREAS, because the permittee failed to file with the Director their letter of acceptance of the terms of the permit conferred by Ordinance 122436, that permission must be deemed lapsed and forfeited under the terms of Section 17 of that ordinance, and

 WHEREAS, the Chinese Gate construction has been completed; and

 WHEREAS, the adoption of this ordinance grants the permission to allow the traditional Chinese gate to legally occupy a portion of South King Street, and will allow the CIDBIA to comply with the conditions required by the permit; NOW, THEREFORE,

 BE IT ORDAINED BY THE CITY OF SEATTLE AS FOLLOWS:

 Section 1. Subject to the terms and conditions of this ordinance, permission is hereby granted to the CIDBIA its successors and assigns, to construct and maintain a traditional Chinese gate crossing over South King Street, east of 5th Avenue South, for a ten (10) year term, renewable for two successive ten-year terms; specifying the conditions under which this permit is granted, and providing for acceptance of the permit and conditions.

 Section 2. The permission for the gate is conditioned upon the applicant providing insurance, maintenance, an annual inspection by a registered structural engineer, payment of the term permit fees, and removal of the gate and restoration of the right-of-way to its original condition upon expiration of the term permit or at the direction of the Director in accordance with Section 6 of this ordinance.

 Section 3. The permission herein granted to the Permittee, its successors and assigns, shall be for a term of ten (10) years commencing 30 days after the Mayor's signature, and terminating at 11:59 p.m. ten years thereafter; provided, however, that upon written application of the Permittee at least thirty (30) days before expiration of the term, the Director may renew the permit for two (2) successive ten (10) year terms, provided further that the total term of the

 permission as originally granted and thus extended shall not exceed thirty (30) years, subject to the right of The City of Seattle ("City)" by ordinance to then revise any of the terms and conditions contained herein.

 Section 4. The permission is hereby subject to any protection, support or relocation of existing utilities deemed necessary by the owner of the utility and shall be done at Permittee's expense with the Permittee being responsible for any subsequent damage to the utilities due to the construction, repair, reconstruction, maintenance, or operation of said Chinese gate.

 Section 5. The permit granted hereby is subject to primary and secondary use by the public of the street right-of-way for travel and utility purposes, and the City expressly reserves the right to require the Permittee to remove said gate at Permittee's sole cost and expense in the event that:

 a) The City Council determines, by ordinance, that the space occupied by the Chinese gate is necessary for any primary or secondary public use or benefit, or that said gate interferes with any primary or secondary public use or benefit; or

 b) The Director determines that any term or condition of this ordinance has been violated, and such violation has not been corrected by the Permittee after notice of violation has been given by the City.

 A City Council determination that the space is necessary for a primary or secondary public use or benefit shall be conclusive and final.

 Section 6. In the event that the permission hereby granted extends to its termination in thirty (30) years, or the City orders removal of said Chinese gate pursuant to the terms of this ordinance, then within ninety (90) days after such expiration, termination or order of removal, or prior to the date stated in an "Order to Remove", as the case may be, the Permittee shall remove said gate and shall replace all portions of the street that may have been disturbed for any part of said gate, in as good condition for public use as it was prior to construction of said gate, and in at least as good condition in all respects as the abutting portions thereof. The Director shall then issue a certificate discharging the Permittee from responsibility under this ordinance for occurrences after the date of such discharge.

 Section 7. The Permittee shall not commence reconstruction, relocation, readjustment or repair of said Chinese gate except under the supervision of, and in strict accordance with, plans and specifications approved by the Director. The Director, in his/her judgment, may order such reconstruction, relocation, readjustment or repair of said gate at the Permittee's own cost and expense because of the deterioration or unsafe condition of said gate, grade separations, or the installation, construction, reconstruction, maintenance, operation or repair of any and all municipally-owned public utilities, or for any other cause.

 Section 8. After notice to the Permittee, and failure of the Permittee to correct said unsafe or risk prone condition within the time stated in such notice, the Director may order said Chinese gate removed if the Director deems that it has become unsafe or creates a risk of injury to the public. In a situation in which there is an immediate threat to the health or safety of the public, notice is not required.

 Section 9. Notwithstanding termination or expiration of the permission granted, or removal of said Chinese gate, the Permittee shall remain bound by its obligation under this ordinance until:

 a) said gate and all its equipment and property are removed from the street;

 b) the area is cleared and restored in a manner and to a condition satisfactory to the Director; and

 c) The Director certifies that the Permittee has discharged its obligation herein.

 Provided that upon prior notice to the Permittee and entry of written findings that such is in the public interest, the Director may, in his/her sole discretion, excuse the Permittee, conditionally or absolutely, from compliance with all or any of the Permittee's obligations to remove said Chinese gate and its property, and restore disturbed areas.

 Section 10. Said Chinese gate shall remain the exclusive responsibility of the Permittee. The Permittee, by acceptance of the terms set forth in this ordinance and the permission hereby granted, releases the City from any and all claims resulting from damage or loss to its own property and does covenant and agree for itself, its successors and assigns, with the City, to at all times protect and save harmless the City from all claims, actions, suits, liability, loss, costs, expense or damages of every kind and description (excepting only such damages that may result from the negligence of the City), which may accrue to, or be suffered by, any person or persons and/or property or properties, including without limitation, damage or injury to the Permittee, its officers, agents, employees, contractors, invitees, tenants and tenants' invitees, licensees or its successors and assigns, by reason of the maintenance, operation or use of said Chinese gate, or any portion thereof, or by reason of anything that has been done, or may at any time be done, by the Permittee, its successors or assigns, by reason of this ordinance, or by reason of the Permittee, its successors or assigns, failing or refusing to strictly comply with each and every provision of this ordinance; and if any such suit, action or claim be filed, instituted or begun against the City, the Permittee, its successors or assigns, shall, upon notice thereof from the City, defend the same at its or their sole cost and expense, and in case judgment shall be rendered against the City in any suit or action, the Permittee, its successors or assigns, shall fully satisfy said judgment within ninety (90) days after such action or suit shall have been finally determined, if determined adversely to the City. Provided that if it is determined by a court of competent jurisdiction that RCW 4.24.115 applies to this ordinance, then in the event claims or damages are caused by or result from the concurrent negligence of:

 a) the City, its agents, contractors or employees; and,

 b) the Permittee, its agents, contractors, employees or its successors or assigns, this indemnity provision shall be valid and enforceable only to the extent of the negligence of the Permittee or the Permittee's agents, contractors, employees or its successors or assigns.

 Section 11. For as long as the Permittee, its successors and assigns, shall exercise any permission granted by this ordinance and until said Chinese gate is entirely removed from its location as described in Section 1 or until discharged by order of the Director as provided in Section 6 of this ordinance, the Permittee shall obtain and maintain in full force and effect, at its own expense, insurance policies which fully protect the City from any all claims and risks of any loss from perils which can be insured against under general liability insurance contracts and fire insurance contracts, including any extended coverage endorsements thereto which are customarily available from time to time, in conjunction with:

 a) construction, reconstruction, operation, maintenance, use or existence of said Chinese gate permitted by this ordinance and of any and all portions of said gate;

 b) Permittee's activity upon, or the use or occupation of, the area described in Section 1 of this ordinance, and

 c) any and all claims and risks in connection with and activity performed by the Permittee by virtue of the permission granted by this ordinance.

 Minimum insurance requirements shall be a policy of comprehensive commercial general liability of a form acceptable to the City. The City will require insurance coverage to be placed with a company admitted and licensed to conduct business in Washington State, except that if it is infeasible to obtain such a policy, the City may approve an alternative company. Minimum policy limits shall be $1,000,000 per occurrence and $2,000,000 annual aggregate each period. Coverage shall specifically name said Chinese gate exposure. Liability coverage shall add by endorsement the City of Seattle, its elected and appointed officers, officials, employees and agents as additional insured. Coverage shall contain a Separation of Insured's clause indicating essentially that "except with respect to the limits of insurance, and any rights or duties specifically assigned in this coverage part of the first named insured, this insurance applies as if each named insured were the only named insured, and separately to each insured against whom claim is made or suit is brought". The City will not accept a certificate of insurance as evidence of current coverage.

 Evidence of current coverage shall be submitted to the City in the form of a photocopy of the insurance policy declaration page, indicating all endorsements attached thereto, and is acondition to the validity of this permit.

 Whenever in the judgment of the Risk Manager of the City of Seattle, such insurance filed pursuant to the provisions hereof shall be deemed insufficient to fully protect the City of Seattle, the Permittee shall, upon demand by the Risk Manager, furnish additional insurance in such amount as may be specified by the Risk Manager.

 Section 12. The Permittee shall require that any and all of its contractors performing construction work on the premises as contemplated by this permit, name the City as an additional insured on all policies of public liability insurance, and shall include in all contract documents a provision extending construction indemnities and warranties granted to Permittee to the City as well.

 Section 13. Within sixty (60) days after the effective date of this ordinance the Permittee shall deliver to the Director for filing with the City Clerk a good and sufficient bond or irrevocable letter of credit in the sum of $50,000 executed by a surety company authorized and qualified to do business in the State of Washington, conditioned that the Permittee will comply with each and every provision of this ordinance and with each and every order of the Director pursuant thereto; provided, that if the Mayor in his judgment shall deem any bond or irrevocable letter of credit filed to be insufficient and demand a new or additional bond or irrevocable letter of credit, the Permittee shall furnish a new or additional bond or irrevocable letter of credit in such amount as the Mayor may specify to be necessary to fully protect the City. Said bond or irrevocable letter of credit shall remain in effect until such time as said Chinese gate is entirely removed from its location as described in Section 1, or until discharged by order of the Director as provided in Section 6 of this ordinance.

 Section 14. The Permittee, its successors and assigns, shall not assign or transfer any privileges conferred by this ordinance without the consent of the City Council by resolution. Notwithstanding anything contained herein to the contrary, consent of the City Council shall not be required for any transfer or assignment of the privileges conferred by this ordinance by way of mortgage, pledge or encumbrance or by way of foreclosure or deed in lieu of foreclosure of any mortgage, pledge or encumbrance. If permission is granted, the assignee or transferee shall be bound by all terms and conditions of this ordinance.

 Section 15. The Permittee, its successors and assigns, shall pay to the City such amounts as may be justly chargeable by the City as costs of inspection of said Chinese gate during construction, reconstruction, repair, annual structural inspections, and at other times deemed necessary to ensure the safety of said gate, under the direction of the Director, as provided by Municipal Code Section 15.76. Permittee shall also promptly pay to the City in advance upon statements rendered by the Director an annual fee for the privileges granted and exercised hereunder of $1634.58 beginning the effective date of this ordinance and payable annually thereafter. This rate shall be held constant for the first five years of the permit. For the sixth year and thereafter, adjustments to the annual fee amount shall be made in accordance with a term permit fee schedule adopted by the City Council by ordinance and may be adjusted every year. In the absence of such a schedule, the Director may only increase or decrease the previous year's fee amount annually to reflect any inflationary changes so as to charge said fee in constant dollar terms. This adjustment will be calculated by adjusting the previous year's fee amount by the percentage change between the two most recent year-end values available of the Consumer Price Index for the Seattle-Tacoma-Bremerton Area, All Urban Consumers, All Products, and Not Seasonally Adjusted. All payments shall be made to the City Finance Director for credit to the Transportation Operating Fund.

 Section 16. The Permittee shall not discriminate against any (1) employee, (2) applicant for employment, or (3) person with respect to the award or referral of a contract or with respect to the conditions, terms, price or performance standards, or other provisions of a contract in connection with the design, architectural or structural engineering work or the construction, repair, or maintenance of said Chinese gate permitted to be erected and/or operated pursuant to this ordinance, on the basis of race, religion, creed, color, sex, marital status, sexual orientation, gender identity, political ideology, ancestry, age, national origin, or the presence of any sensory, mental or physical handicap unless based upon bona fide occupational qualification. The Permittee shall:

 a) post in conspicuous places available to such employees and applicants for such employment, notices setting forth the provisions of this non discrimination clause; and

 b) insert in any contract for work undertaken in connection with the design, architectural or structural engineering work or the repair, construction, maintenance or operation of said Chinese gate referenced in this ordinance language substantially similar to the language contained in this Section 16 and which requires any person or entity entering into such contract to comply with the non discrimination provisions of this Section.

 Section 17. The Permittee shall deliver its written acceptance of the permission conferred by this ordinance and its terms and conditions to the Director within sixty (60) days after the effective date of this ordinance. The acceptance shall be filed with the City Clerk. If no such acceptance is received by then, the privileges provided by this ordinance shall be deemed declined or abandoned; and the permission extended, contingent upon its acceptance, deemed lapsed and forfeited.

 Section 18. Ordinance 122436 is hereby repealed.

 Section 19. This ordinance shall take effect and be in force thirty (30) days from and after its approval by the Mayor, but if not approved and returned by the Mayor within ten (10) days after presentation, it shall take effect as provided by Municipal Code Section 1.04.020.
