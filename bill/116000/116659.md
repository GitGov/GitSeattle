 AN ORDINANCE relating to the Lake Union Park Armory; authorizing the Superintendent of Parks and Recreation to enter into a development agreement and lease to allow the Museum of History and Industry to redevelop and use the Lake Union Armory Building for a new regional history museum.

 WHEREAS, since 1914, the Historical Society of Seattle and King County, a Washington nonprofit corporation doing business as the Museum of History and Industry ("MOHAI"), has been collecting, preserving and presenting the history of the Pacific Northwest, and its exhibits and programs generate broad public appreciation for our region's diverse cultural, social and economic history; and

 WHEREAS, MOHAI has grown to become the largest private heritage organization in the State of Washington, attracting to its facility more than 60,000 visitors annually from the Northwest and beyond; and

 WHEREAS, MOHAI and the City have had a successful relationship since 1948 when MOHAI constructed and then donated to the City the first phase of its facility at McCurdy Park in the Montlake neighborhood (the "Montlake Location), establishing a pattern that would be followed in each of four successive expansions of its museum, curatorial, educational and administrative facilities at the Montlake Location; and

 WHEREAS, MOHAI has since successfully operated its museum and related facilities in the Montlake Location; however, MOHAI began to explore other options for its facilities based on concerns about the long-term viability of the Montlake Location as MOHAI's permanent home, particularly given its location adjacent to SR 520 and the increasing likelihood that eventual expansion of SR 520 would require MOHAI's relocation; and

 WHEREAS, in pursuit of a new permanent home, MOHAI in 2003 purchased a commercial condominium unit within the expanded Washington State Convention and Trade Center (the "WSCTC Property") in downtown Seattle for the purpose of constructing and operating a new regional history museum at that location; and

 WHEREAS, the City provided funds toward the purchase of MOHAI's WSCTC Property and, under a series of agreements between the City and MOHAI, acquired a restrictive covenant on and an easement for the use of the WSCTC Property for public museum purposes; and

 WHEREAS, with the City's acquisition of the former U.S. Naval Reserve Armory (the "Armory Building") at South Lake Union; its subsequent investment in basic restoration of the Armory Building structure; the construction of the City's new Lake Union Park; and the continuing redevelopment of the South Lake Union neighborhood, the City Department of Parks and Recreation invited MOHAI to engage with it in evaluating establishment of the new MOHAI regional history museum in the Armory Building rather than at MOHAI's WSCTC Property; and

 WHEREAS, maritime heritage is one of the strengths of MOHAI's collection and MOHAI enjoys a meaningful and collaborative relationship with several maritime heritage organizations, many of which already are resident at South Lake Union; and

 WHEREAS, after preliminary due diligence, the MOHAI Board of Trustees resolved that it favored the concept of establishing its primary public venue at the Armory Building in lieu of developing the WSCTC Property; and

 WHEREAS, the Washington State Convention and Trade Center (the "WSCTC") independently determined that it would prefer to acquire MOHAI's WSCTC Property for its own expansion purposes and offered to do so; and

 WHEREAS, due diligence on the Armory Building option for a new regional history museum was sufficiently encouraging to MOHAI that MOHAI determined to sell the WSCTC Property to the WSCTC; and

 WHEREAS, the City concurred that the Armory Building project showed sufficient promise that it agreed, through Ordinance Number 122471, to release its restrictions and security interest in the WSCTC Property to facilitate its sale to the WSCTC, on condition that MOHAI reserve One Million Dollars ($1,000,000) plus accrued interest from its sale proceeds for capital costs associated with the development of a new MOHAI museum to be located elsewhere within the city; and

 WHEREAS, through Resolutions 30917, 31011 and 31092, the City Council encouraged the Department of Parks and Recreation to pursue the MOHAI project at the Armory Building, developed a framework for jointly determining the feasibility of developing the Armory Building into MOHAI's new regional history museum, and subsequently established principles to inform the negotiation of project agreements; and

 WHEREAS, MOHAI, in consultation with the United States Navy's Real Estate Contracting Officer, has confirmed that MOHAI's proposed use of the Armory Building is consistent with deed restrictions designed to protect the building's historic character and ensure that it remained in public use; and

 WHEREAS, MOHAI's redevelopment of the Armory Building and its anticipated collaboration with other maritime heritage organizations to form a Maritime Heritage Partnership at Lake Union Park will create a unique heritage experience at the park for the benefit of a broad cross section of the public and will symbolize and reinforce the ongoing revitalization of the South Lake Union neighborhood; and

 WHEREAS, MOHAI is presently investigating the feasibility of obtaining historic rehabilitation tax credit financing for the rehabilitation of the Armory Building, which financing would require that ownership of the Armory Building be conveyed, and the underlying land leased, to a for- profit entity that MOHAI would create and control; and

 WHEREAS, ownership of the Armory Building would revert to the City at the termination of the ground lease; and

 WHEREAS, the City and MOHAI have determined that various documents, including a project development agreement addressing the funding, design, and construction of the project and a long-term lease of the site to be occupied by MOHAI's museum are necessary and appropriate for memorializing the relationship between the City and MOHAI for undertaking the Armory Building museum project; NOW, THEREFORE,

 BE IT ORDAINED BY THE CITY OF SEATTLE AS FOLLOWS:

 Section 1. The Superintendent or his designee is authorized to execute a development agreement, substantially in the form of Attachment 1 hereto, that will allow MOHAI to renovate the Armory Building for museum purposes.

 Section 2. If MOHAI has received the approval of the National Parks Service for the proposed renovation of the Armory Building, a firm commitment from a tax credit investor to utilize the Historic Rehabilitation Tax Credits, and has determined that it will utilize Historic Rehabilitation Tax Credits to finance a portion of the project, then the Superintendent is further authorized to execute and record a quitclaim deed for the Armory Building substantially in the form of Exhibit B to Attachment 1, that will convey ownership of the Armory Building to MOHAI or its for-profit affiliate on the condition that it be used solely for museum and museum-related purposes, together with a lease of the underlying real property substantially in the form of Attachment 2 hereto. If MOHAI elects not to utilize Historic Rehabilitation Tax Credits to finance the construction of the project, then the Superintendent is authorized to execute and record a lease of the Armory Building to MOHAI substantially in the form of Attachment 3 hereto.

 Section 3. The Superintendent, or his designee, is further authorized and directed, for and on behalf of the City, to make technical, conforming or otherwise nonmaterial changes to the Agreement, and to execute, deliver, record, administer and perform such ancillary agreements or documents or to take such other actions as in their judgment may be necessary, appropriate or desirable in order to carry out the terms and provisions of, and complete the transactions contemplated by, this ordinance.

 Section 4. This ordinance shall take effect and be in force thirty (30) days from and after its approval by the Mayor, but if not approved and returned by the Mayor within ten (10) days after presentation, it shall take effect as provided by Municipal Code Section 1.04.020.

 General Provisions

 Section 3.1 Scope. MOHAI will substantially restore the Armory Building consistent with applicable historic preservation guidelines and transform it into a new regional history museum at an estimated total cost of approximately Forty Five Million Four Hundred Thousand Dollars ($45,400,000) (in 2010 dollars), consisting of two components. The components include: (a) Armory Building restoration (the "Project"), including shell and core rehabilitation, comprehensive building systems upgrades, access and circulation improvements, and achieving life safety code compliance, expected to cost (in 2010 dollars) approximately Thirty Million Two Hundred Thousand Dollars ($30,200,000), inclusive of design costs, permit fees and other soft costs; and (b) Museum installation, including exhibitry design, fabrication and installation, expected to cost (in 2010 dollars) approximately Fifteen Million Two Hundred Thousand Dollars ($15,200,000). The Project shall be designed to achieve Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) certification at the 2009 Silver level or greater, under the U.S. Green Building Council's Rating System. The Project will include exhibit galleries in the large open volume of the building that also will serve the community as a space for large gatherings and events. Traditional museum support spaces such as classrooms and a retail store; amenities including a cafe and restrooms available to both visitors to Lake Union Park and Museum patrons; and work space for MOHAI and Parks staff also will be provided. The Project is represented in Design Development Documents dated June, 2009 by LMN Architects, attached hereto as Exhibit A. The Project will continue to evolve through its design, negotiations with MOHAI's general contractor, permitting and construction. As a result, Project design will be subject to the Development Agreement Parties' continuing review and approval, as provided herein.

 Section 3.2 Basic Relationship of Development Agreement Parties. MOHAI will be responsible for the design, development and construction of the Project as more specifically provided in this Agreement. Following completion of the Project and placing the Armory Building in service, MOHAI will relocate to and operate or cause to be operated the publicly accessible Museum at the Armory Building. The Development Agreement Parties each bring substantial resources and commitments to the Project. Together with other maritime heritage organizations already resident at South Lake Union, MOHAI will participate in a Maritime Heritage Group to be organized and managed by the City.

 3.2.1 Project Development Agreement. The Development Agreement Parties' rights, responsibilities and obligations during design, development and construction of the Project are delineated in this Agreement.

 3.2.2 Lease. The Development Agreement Parties' long term rights, responsibilities and obligations during operation of the Museum at the Armory Building will be reflected in the Lease. Under the Lease, MOHAI will be obligated to provide enumerated public benefits in the operation of the Museum. Subject to Section 3.2.3, the Lease will allocate responsibilities between the City and MOHAI for routine and long term maintenance of the Armory Building and the underlying Building Pile System that supports it. Parking and access will be addressed as will management of the Maritime Heritage Group. The Lease also will provide for continued use of MOHAI's Montlake location by MOHAI until it is demolished by the State for or otherwise becomes unavailable as a result of expansion of SR 520 construction.

 3.2.3 Federal Historic Rehabilitation Tax Credits. The City and MOHAI intend to secure the right to claim federal historic rehabilitation tax credits for the Project. In order for the Project to be eligible for such credits, the City must convey ownership of the Armory Building to the Tax Credit Entity (either directly or indirectly through MOHAI). The Parties concur that such conveyance will be accomplished via direct deed from the City to the Tax Credit Entity. If MOHAI has secured a firm commitment from a tax credit investor on terms reasonably acceptable to MOHAI and upon satisfaction of the conditions precedent to the issuance by MOHAI of its Notice to Proceed as provided in Section 5.5, the City, prior to the start of Project construction, will convey ownership of the Armory Building. Such conveyance will be by quit claim deed substantially in the form attached as Exhibit B, which, in addition to conveying ownership of the building, will restrict its use to museum and related purposes and also incorporates the requirements of the historic preservation covenant included in the deed by which the United States conveyed the property to the City in 2000. The City agrees to execute any additional documents reasonably necessary to effect and otherwise cooperate in such conveyance. In such event, the City, MOHAI and the Tax Credit Entity will execute the Ground Lease for the Armory Building site and the City, MOHAI and the Tax Credit Entity will execute a Joinder Agreement substantially in the form provided in Exhibit C under which the Tax Credit Entity joins in and assumes MOHAI's rights and obligations under this Development Agreement. MOHAI agrees to require the Tax Credit Entity to execute the Ground Lease and the Joinder Agreement. In the event MOHAI is unable to secure a commitment from a tax credit investor on reasonably acceptable terms or determines it will not need to pursue tax credits in order to secure approval to issue its Notice to Proceed under Section 5.5, the City and MOHAI will execute a Lease for the Armory Building and land and no Joinder Agreement will be needed.

 Section 3.3 Schedule. MOHAI shall use its best efforts to start construction of the Project within one (1) year from the completion of the Lake Union Park Phase II renovations being completed by the City, but in no event later than January 1, 2013, unless compensation from the expansion of SR 520 by MOHAI is substantially delayed and the Development Agreement Parties agree to extend that deadline. The current "Project Timeline" is attached hereto as Exhibit D. The Project Timeline remains subject to change.

 Section 3.4 Parking Planning. The Superintendent, in consultation with MOHAI and other organizations resident at Lake Union Park and the Seattle Parks Foundation, shall complete an initial Parking Plan addressing use of the North Parking Lot proximate to the Armory Building and general public parking resources for the use of visitors to Lake Union Park, the Museum and other facilities resident at the Park. The initial Parking Plan shall be completed by the date MOHAI issues its Notice to Proceed. The Parking Plan shall be consistent with MOHAI's parking easement rights under Section 1.5.2 of the Lease and its right to use of other parking resources under Section 1.7 of the Lease. Although MOHAI understands the Parking Plan will be developed through a collaborative process involving the other organizations resident at Lake Union Park and the Seattle Parks Foundation, the Development Agreement Parties agree that the initial Parking Plan and successor Parking Plans must be reasonably acceptable to MOHAI in recognition of its relative size and need for access to parking. The Development Agreement Parties agree that the Parking Plan may be incorporated as a feature of the Operations and Maintenance Plan the Superintendent is required to develop under the City's agreement with the Seattle Parks Foundation regarding Lake Union Park.

 In addressing use of the North Parking Lot and the use of other public parking currently available on site, the initial and successor Parking Plans should be developed consistent with principles or considerations that take into account factors such as (a) total staff required for operation of the respective tenant facilities; (b) capital investment in the respective cultural facilities in or immediately adjacent to Lake Union Park; (c) general public attendance, excluding special events, based on uniformly applied standards; and (d) public attendance at special events, based on uniformly applied standards. Recognizing that City owned and managed public parking is at a premium on site at Lake Union Park and in its vicinity, the City will work with MOHAI, the maritime heritage community, and the Seattle Parks Foundation to maximize City owned, controlled and managed parking conveniently located for visitors to Lake Union Park and amenities located there or nearby. The City will consult with MOHAI and other Lake Union Park Tenants on Lake Union Park public parking availability, expansion and management and develop, implement and periodically review and update its Parking Plan.

 ARTICLE 4

 Capital Budget and Funding

 Section 4.1 Capital Budget. The current Capital Budget ("Capital Budget") is attached hereto as Exhibit E. The Capital Budget remains subject to change and the Development Agreement Parties' continuing review and approval, as provided herein.

 Section 4.2 City Direct Funding and Other City-Related Support. The following represent the City's contributions to and support for the Project:

 (a) The City contributed certain funds toward MOHAI's purchase of the WSCTC Property. As a condition of releasing its restrictions and security interest in the WSCTC Property, the City required that One Million Two Hundred Twenty-Seven Thousand Eight Hundred Fifteen Dollars and Twelve Cents ($1,227,815.12) of the sale proceeds, representing the City's original outstanding contributions plus interest to the date of the sale, be restricted for use by MOHAI for project capital costs associated with the development within the City of a new museum, construction of which may not begin later than June 30, 2017.

 (b) The City has undertaken utility upgrades (identified in the attached Exhibit F) and other improvements to the Armory Building and surrounding portions of Lake Union Park that are directly or indirectly beneficial to development of the Museum in the Armory Building.

 (c) The City will assign to MOHAI all of its share of compensation for acquisition and/or condemnation by the Washington State Department of Transportation ("WSDOT") of the MOHAI building at, and certain other real property interests in, MOHAI's Montlake Location, as provided in the Agency and Contribution Agreement between the City and MOHAI and attached hereto as Exhibit G (the "Condemnation Agreement").

 (d) The funds identified in Sections 4.2.1(a) and (c) shall become available for use and expenditure by MOHAI when MOHAI receives approval to issue its Notice to Proceed with construction of the Project as provided in Section 5.5.

 (e) Possible Recovery of Funding by City. As provided in the Release of Covenant and Easement between the City and MOHAI dated September 27, 2007, in the event that MOHAI does not commence construction of a new regional history museum within the City by June 30, 2017, MOHAI will return to the City the City's funds described in Section 4.2.1(a), plus all accrued interest. MOHAI will return to the City some or all of the funds described in Section 4.2.1(c) under the circumstances described in the Condemnation Agreement.

 Section 4.3 MOHAI Funding.

 4.3.1 MOHAI Funds and Fundraising.

 (a) MOHAI shall use its best efforts to secure additional county, state and federal funds for the Project, in recognition of the fact that the Museum is of regional significance.

 (b) As reflected in Exhibit E, the Capital Budget currently totals Forty Five Million Four Hundred Thousand Dollars ($45,400,000) to complete both the Armory Building restoration and the Museum installation, to be provided from all available sources, including the City and other City-related funding identified in Section 4.2. MOHAI will be responsible for securing the balance of funding needed to fully fund the Capital Budget, increased or decreased as appropriate resulting from scope, design and schedule changes and any cost overruns, all as provided herein. MOHAI's fundraising commitment shall be increased to reflect the additional cost of any financing necessary to ensure the availability of funding as needed during construction of the Project (above the projected cost of any such financing reflected in the Capital Budget). MOHAI agrees to use its best efforts to secure commitments from private individuals, corporations and foundations, as well as governmental sources (other than the City) for such funds on a schedule consistent with its Fundraising Plan, attached hereto as Exhibit H. MOHAI's success in achieving its fundraising objectives shall be evaluated by the City Finance Director when making his or her determinations under Section 5.5.2(b). Such evaluation shall include review of MOHAI's private sector donor pledges, pledge payment experience and such other relevant information the Finance Director may reasonably require. MOHAI's private sector donor pledges will be reviewed by the Finance Director under procedures to protect the confidentiality of donors and MOHAI donor- related information to the extent possible. MOHAI will submit to the Finance Director a copy of the pledges in a form acceptable to the Finance Director, with donor names verified by the Finance Director but omitted from the copy submitted. The Finance Director will approve a pledge if it is from a person or entity of substantial net worth in relation to the amount pledged and the Finance Director knows of no reason why the pledge will not be honored.

 4.3.2 Historic Rehabilitation Tax Credits; Conveyance of Armory Building. MOHAI agrees to use its best efforts to secure federal historic rehabilitation tax credits for the Project as a feature of the resources MOHAI will bring to it, as more particularly described in Section 3.2.3 and the City agrees to use its best efforts to assist MOHAI, as necessary, in securing federal historic rehabilitation tax credit financing for the Project.

 ARTICLE 5

 Project Design and Construction

 Section 5.1 Construction Management. Subject to the requirements of this Agreement, MOHAI shall undertake and be responsible for the management of all aspects of the design and construction of the Project. MOHAI shall engage and manage, without limitation, project managers, architects and other design professionals and a general contractor with the expertise and experience necessary to successfully complete the project. In conducting any construction work on the premises, MOHAI shall cause all work to be done in a good and workmanlike manner and shall comply with or cause compliance with all laws. MOHAI shall obtain or cause to be obtained and maintain in effect, as necessary, all building permits, licenses and other governmental approvals that may be required in connection with such work. MOHAI shall complete construction of the Project substantially consistent with the Final Project Design, except as specifically provided herein. MOHAI shall use its good faith best efforts to resolve issues that may arise during construction to avoid material or other changes to the Final Project Design that would require the approval of the Superintendent by, among other measures, applying contingency funding available within the Project component of the Final Capital Budget; adjusting the Project Timeline; reducing costs through permissible changes to the Final Project Design and other means; and, as needed, committing additional funds to supplement the Project component of the Final Capital Budget.

 Section 5.2 Requirements for Construction. In managing the Project, MOHAI shall ensure that the Project and its general contractor and others as appropriate comply with the following requirements:

 (a) MOHAI shall require that its general contractor for the Project: (i) complies with prevailing wages requirements as if the Project were a public work for purposes of RCW 39.12; and (ii) participates in the construction trades apprenticeship program, endeavoring to achieve fifteen percent (15%) utilization of apprentices;

 (b) The Project will be subject to the affirmative efforts and nondiscrimination requirements under SMC 20.42 and the equal benefits requirements under SMC 20.45; and

 (c) The Project component of the Capital Budget will include at least One Hundred Fifty Thousand Dollars ($150,000) to provide public art as part of the Project. The public art may be incorporated as a component of the Armory Building restoration. The selection of public art shall follow a process agreed to between MOHAI and the City's Office of Arts & Cultural Affairs or that office's successor. It is expected that the Office of Arts & Cultural Affairs will have some representation on the review and selection panel MOHAI will convene and use in the art selection process. If necessary, the public art, its location and display shall be subject to such reviews and approvals as may be required under any applicable agreements regarding Lake Union Park.

 (d) Upon completion of construction of the Project, MOHAI shall apply for Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) certification at the 2009 silver level or higher, under the U.S. Green Building Council's Rating System.

 Section 5.4 Design Review and Approval; Consistent Capital Budget.

 5.4.1 Design Review and Approval. Sequential, major phase design documents shall be subject to review and approval by the Superintendent, which approval shall not be unreasonably denied or delayed. Upon the Superintendent's approval of the Project's fifty percent (50%) construction documents, MOHAI may submit the Project for its building permit. Such documents shall constitute the "Final Project Design" for purposes of this Agreement. Evolution of the Project design is subject to the parallel evolution of a consistent Project component of the Capital Budget at each major design phase. The Capital Budget updated for consistency with the Final Project Design shall constitute the "Final Capital Budget" for purposes of this Agreement. The Project component of the Final Capital Budget shall include appropriate contingencies consistent with industry standards.

 5.4.2 Signage. The Museum may be identified by signage affixed on the Armory Building and located elsewhere on its leased premises. Initial signage for the Armory Building and leased premises shall be incorporated in the Project design and shall be subject to the review and approval of the Superintendent in the context of review and approval of the design as provided in Section 5.4.1. The Project design may also include features or fixtures necessary for the display and support of temporary promotional or informational signage such as banners and flags.

 (c) Concurrence by the Superintendent and the Finance Director that (i) MOHAI's general contractor has agreed to a guaranteed maximum price for construction of the Project as represented in the Final Project Design and consistent with the Project component of the Final Capital Budget; and (ii) MOHAI's contract with its general contractor provides for the requirements for construction under Sections 5.2 and 5.7.

 Section 5.6 Project Management and Coordination.

 (a) Project Manager and Coordinator. At least thirty (30) days prior to issuing its Notice to Proceed, MOHAI shall notify the Superintendent of the identity of the MOHAI construction contractor's project manager ("Project Manager") by name and such person's business and home telephone numbers, and the Parks Department shall provide to MOHAI comparable contact information for the Parks Department project coordinator ("Project Coordinator"). In the event either such person is replaced, the party making such change in personnel shall provide notice to the other no later than the effective date of such replacement, including such replacement's name and business and home telephone numbers.

 (b) Project Construction Meetings. MOHAI's Project Manager shall keep the Parks Department Project Coordinator informed of the time and place of each regular and special project construction meeting to enable the Parks Department Project Coordinator to attend, become informed about the status of the Project, participate in discussions and present the Parks Department's position with respect to matters being discussed. The MOHAI Project Manager shall also participate in such separate meetings with the Parks Department Project Coordinator and, at the Superintendent's option, with the Superintendent's designee, as may be scheduled by the Parks Department Project Coordinator with at least three (3) days' prior notice.

 (c) Status Reports. Within seven (7) days after the receipt by MOHAI of any project construction meeting minutes, MOHAI shall deliver a copy of each of the same to the Parks Department Project Coordinator.

 (d) Minimization of Adverse Impacts. MOHAI shall protect from damage or destruction all private and public property on or in the vicinity of the construction premises that is not scheduled for repair, replacement or removal. All Project-related demolition, construction, alteration, addition, improvement and other activity or work performed by or for MOHAI on the construction premises shall be carried out in a manner that minimizes any adverse impact on City property and the use thereof by the City or third parties, as well as on any private property in the vicinity of the Project. (For purposes of this requirement, the term "property" includes land, trees, shrubbery and landscaping, irrigation facilities, drainage, survey markers and monuments, buildings and structures, conduits and pipes, meters, fences, pavements, curbs, driveways, sidewalks, and other property of any description, excluding the Armory Building and the premises subject to the Lease, except for the Public Use Area.) MOHAI shall prepare for the Superintendent's reasonable review and approval a plan for construction fencing, including routes for temporary pedestrian access around the construction site, before mobilization work begins. MOHAI shall work with the Parks Department Project Coordinator to schedule construction activity to minimize construction impacts such as noise, dust and fumes, to the extent practicable.

 (e) Waste Disposal. MOHAI shall secure and provide within the construction premises, appropriately sized containers for the collection of all waste materials, debris and rubbish associated with the Project. MOHAI shall keep the work site and all adjacent property free from the accumulation of waste materials, rubbish and windblown debris associated with the Project and, on a daily basis, shall dispose of all flammable, hazardous and toxic materials generated by or otherwise associated with the Project. Storage and disposal must be in accordance with applicable Federal, State and local laws, fire codes and regulations. All waste materials, debris and rubbish generated by or otherwise associated with the Project shall be disposed of legally at disposal areas away from the Park. Upon the completion of the Project, MOHAI shall ensure that the construction premises and the roadways and walkways immediately surrounding the construction premises are cleaned to the reasonable satisfaction of the Parks Department Project Coordinator; and that all tools, equipment and surplus materials, and waste materials, debris and rubbish associated with the Project have been removed from the construction premises.

 (f) Restoration. MOHAI shall be responsible for full restoration of all Parks Department property and improvements, excluding the Armory Building and the premises subject to the Lease, except for the Public Use Area, solely or to the extent attributable to MOHAI's construction activity to a condition equal to or better than prior to MOHAI's use of such Parks Department property, including full repair to or replacement if reasonably determined necessary by the Parks Department. MOHAI agrees to warrant (or to assign contractor warranties for) the repair or replacement of such Parks Department property or improvements for a period of one (1) year from the date of MOHAI's of completion of MOHAI's construction activity at the Park. MOHAI shall repair damage to or replace Parks Department property within thirty (30) calendar days of the occurrence of damage solely or to the extent attributable to MOHAI's construction activity to said improvements, unless an alternate deadline is approved by the Superintendent or repair or replacement should occur at a later date to ensure that additional damage would not occur during the normal course of MOHAI's construction activity. MOHAI and the Parks Department will jointly inspect any such damage; evaluate the extent of the damage attributable to MOHAI's construction activity; and provide such documentation as may be necessary and useful to determining appropriate repairs or replacements to redress it. MOHAI shall provide to the Parks Department a video of pre-existing site conditions prior to mobilization, including areas along the Park's access drive, and all Park property adjacent to the MOHAI project site.

 (g) Costs. MOHAI and the Parks Department shall each bear their own costs of performing their respective responsibilities under this Section 5.6.

 Section 5.7 MOHAI Cost Overruns Responsibility and Risk Management.

 5.7.1 Cost Overruns.

 (a) Funds required for any net increases in the Project component of the Final Capital Budget necessary to complete the Project substantially consistent with the Final Project Design (as potentially modified under this Agreement) shall be provided by MOHAI from sources other than the City, except as specifically provided herein. MOHAI's responsibility for cost overruns includes responsibility for those due to unforeseen conditions that need to be addressed in order for the Project to proceed, including any unforeseen preexisting conditions related to the Building Pile System, but only to the extent such conditions can be remedied with resources available within the Project component of the Final Capital Budget. Upon discovery of an unforeseen condition that must be addressed in order for the Project to proceed, MOHAI will notify the Superintendent. MOHAI will evaluate ways to resolve any such conditions to the extent necessary for the Project to proceed and determine the cost of doing so. In addressing such additional cost, MOHAI may, among other measures, apply contingency funds within the Project component of the Final Capital Budget, make modifications to the Final Project Design, and apply such additional funds that MOHAI, in its sole discretion, determines to provide to increase the Project component of the Final Capital Budget. MOHAI will keep the Superintendent apprised of its work and advise him or her of its plans for addressing such conditions, specifically including any proposed changes in the Final Project Design requiring his or her approval under Section 5.8. In the event MOHAI concludes that it lacks the resources to address any such unforeseen conditions and that, as a result, it will not be able to complete the Project, it will so notify the Superintendent. The Development Agreement Parties will cooperate in developing and implementing a plan to suspend or terminate the Project. If the Project is so terminated before completion, MOHAI shall (i) return ownership or control of the Armory Building and its site to the City in no worse overall condition than it was in at the inception of the Project and suitable for uses consistent with its prior use as a general purpose community event center; (ii) return to the City some or all of the funds described in Section 4.2.1(c) under the circumstances described in the Condemnation Agreement, net of Project construction costs expended as of the date of termination, including the costs of restoration as required herein; and (iii) be responsible for all transaction costs arising out of or relating to the termination.

 (b) MOHAI's responsibility for cost overruns notwithstanding, the City shall bear financial responsibility for any direct or indirect cost increases associated with changes to the Project that the City requests after the Superintendent approves the Final Project Design (excluding permitting or other regulatory requirements).

 5.7.2 Retainage and Bonding. MOHAI shall establish retainage at not less than five percent (5%) of its contractor's guaranteed maximum price and shall require bonding by its contractor to the extent warranted, in its judgment and discretion after consultation with the Superintendent.

 5.7.3 Insurance Requirements. In addition to the insurance obligations under the Lease, MOHAI shall obtain or cause to be obtained insurance in the following forms and with the limits of not less than those stated, with the City named as an additional insured, unless MOHAI and the City modify these requirements:

 (a) Professional Liability Insurance. Architect's and engineer's professional liability insurance covering the architect with a minimum limit of Two Million Dollars ($2,000,000) for each claim.

 (b) Commercial General Liability. Commercial general liability insurance for the architect and the general contractor with minimum combined single limits of Two Million Dollars ($2,000,000) for the architect and Two Million Dollars ($2,000,000) for the general contractor for each occurrence. The policy shall include without limitation coverage for bodily injury, broad form property damage, personal injury (including but not limited to coverage for contractual and employee acts), blanket contractual, owner's and contractor's protective liability, and products and completed operations. Further, the policy for the general contractor shall include without limitation coverage for the hazards commonly referred to as "XCU" and shall contain a severability of interests provision. The products and completed operations coverage for the general contractor shall extend for three (3) years past the commencement of the Lease.

 (c) Automobile Liability. Automobile liability insurance for the architect and general contractor with a combined single limit for bodily injury and property damage of not less than One Million Dollars ($1,000,000) each occurrence with respect to vehicles assigned to or used in the construction of the Project.

 (d) Contractor's Equipment. Contractor's equipment insurance for the architect and general contractor covering owned, non-owned, leased equipment used in connection with construction of the Project. With the approval of MOHAI, the architect and the general contractor may self- insure owned, non-owned or leased equipment.

 (e) Builder's Risk. Builder's risk insurance with a limit of liability consistent with the requirements of MOHAI's general contractor contract. The coverage shall be written on all risk of direct damage basis and shall include coverage for fire and physical loss or damage from flood and earthquake. Builder's risk insurance shall cover construction at the site, at any off-site storage location, if appropriate, and while in transit, any and all materials, equipment, machinery, tools and supplies, including buildings and all temporary structures to be used in or incidental to the fabrication, erection, testing or completion of the Project.

 5.7.4 Liens. MOHAI will pay or cause to be paid all sums payable by them on account of any labor performed or materials furnished in connection with any work performed on the Project. MOHAI will use its good faith best efforts to discharge, by bond or otherwise, any mechanic's or materialman's lien filed against the premises for work claimed to have been done for, or materials claimed to have been furnished to MOHAI, within thirty (30) days after filing.

 Section 5.8 Changes During Construction. Any material change to the Final Project Design requires the approval of the Superintendent, which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed. A material change represents a major departure from the Final Project Design including but not limited to elimination or addition of a significant element or feature; discernible or functional alteration in the quality or projected performance of any significant feature or system; or any significant change in the use or appearance of any major space or component. Any changes in the Required General Public Amenities required under this Agreement and as represented in the Final Project Design shall require the approval of the Superintendent.

 Section 5.9 Building Pile System.

 (a) MOHAI Responsibilities During Construction. If MOHAI elects to reinforce or add to the Building Pile System so as to provide support for any increased load associated with the Project, such work (as to the initial installation) will be at MOHAI's expense. In addition to MOHAI's responsibility under Section 5.7.1 for unforeseen preexisting conditions related to the Building Pile System that need to be addressed in order for the Project to proceed, MOHAI shall be responsible for the cost to repair measurable damage to the Building Pile System or Armory Building that the City can demonstrate was caused by the MOHAI Project and is determined to exist based on surveys as provided herein. MOHAI will inform the Superintendent of any damage to the Building Pile System incurred during construction and the measures it proposes to take to repair such damage, which measures shall be subject to the Superintendent's reasonable approval. MOHAI will confirm that such repairs have been completed. MOHAI also will survey the position of the Armory before issuing its Notice to Proceed and provide the survey results to the Superintendent.

 In order to determine whether movement of the Armory Building has occurred as a result of the Project, MOHAI will again survey the position of the Armory Building both upon Project completion and contemporaneously with the issuance of a certificate of occupancy for the Museum. MOHAI will provide results of both subsequent surveys to the Superintendent. If movement has occurred during construction that exceeds the normal tolerance of survey instruments and procedures (three eighths of one inch - 3/8"), the Development Agreement Parties will evaluate its significance and resolve how to address any resulting material problems related to the ability of the Building Pile System to support the Armory Building for its intended use for Museum and related purposes. To the extent that the Project was responsible for such unanticipated movement and the Parties conclude that such movement materially affects the ability of the Building Pile System to support the Armory Building for its intended use for Museum and related purposes, MOHAI will pay for the remedial measures the Parties determine are necessary and appropriate to address it.

 (b) City Responsibilities Following Construction. Following completion by MOHAI of the survey of the position of the Armory Building contemporaneously with the issuance of the certificate of occupancy for the Museum and the completion of any remedial measures that the Development Agreement Parties may have determined necessary under Section 5.9(a), and subject to the provisions of the Lease regarding damage and destruction (i) the City will be exclusively responsible for the condition of the Building Pile System and for maintaining it in a safe and sound condition, capable of supporting the Armory Building for its use for Museum and related purposes for the duration of its use as such; and (ii) the City will address, at no cost to MOHAI, any conditions that impair the ability of the Building Pile System to support the Armory Building for its intended use for Museum and related purposes for the duration of its use as such. Notwithstanding the foregoing, with respect to any (a) alterations to the Armory Building or Premises that affect the Building Pile System; or (b) specific changes or additions to exhibitry reasonably likely to affect the Building Pile System, either of which are undertaken after issuance of the certificate of occupancy for the Museum, MOHAI and the Superintendent shall reasonably determine the measures, if any, to be undertaken in conjunction with such alteration or exhibitry change or addition described in clauses (a) or (b) above that are needed to enable the Building Pile System to continue to support the Armory Building for its intended use for Museum and related purposes. MOHAI shall at its expense, complete such measures as a component of its alteration or exhibitry change or addition. MOHAI also will inform the Superintendent of any damage to or adverse affects on the Building Pile System incurred during the construction of any alteration or exhibitry change or addition described in clauses (a) or (b) above, together with the measures it proposes to take to repair any such damage, which measures shall be subject to the Superintendent's reasonable approval. MOHAI will confirm that such repairs have been completed. All such measures or repairs shall be the property of the City upon their completion and shall thereafter be considered part of the Building Pile System (and be maintained, repaired or replaced by the City as required herein).

 CITY IMPROVEMENTS TO LAKE UNION PARK

 As part of the development of Lake Union Park Phase II, the City will make certain utility upgrades to the Amory Building utility infrastructure to facilitate the renovation of the Armory Building as a regional history museum. Except as noted herein, the City shall install all utilities as shown on the Lake Union Park Phase 2 "Construction Drawings" dated April 5, 2008.

 * General Utility Upgrades: All new utilities will be installed underground.

 * Water Supply Line: In lieu of the 3" service line shown on the drawing U-3.1 extending from the 6" meter adjacent to the existing pump house, the City shall install a new 6" water line (from the SPU meter to the Armory Building). The City has elected not to replace the existing 8" water main from Valley Street to the SPU meter. Responsibility for the maintenance of that line shall remain exclusively with the City.

 * Water Meter: The SPU meter jointly serves the irrigation for the Park and the Armory Building. The Museum shall install its own sub-meter inside the Armory Building to allow the parties to monitor water usage by the Museum and shall cooperate on developing a mutually agreeable system for payment of water charges.

 * Fire Hydrants: The two hydrants adjacent to the Armory Building will not be relocated as part of the Phase II work. The Museum plans to relocate both of these as part of the Armory Building renovation.

 * Fire Department Connection: An existing Fire Department Connection (FDC) near the north end of Terry Avenue serves the north wharf area. This FDC will be re-located by the Museum. Final location will be approved by both the Parks Department and Seattle Fire Department.

 * Sewer: Installation of a new sewer lift station and force main serving the Armory Building. In addition, the City shall install a side sewer stub that extends from the lift station under the Terry Avenue walk, capped, marked, and ready for the future tie-in by the Museum. Peak rate of sewer effluent from the Museum and pump capacity by the Park system will be coordinated between the Parks Department and Museum design teams.

 * Electrical: Removal of all overhead lines and installation of a new underground vault servicing the Armory Building. The City shall install a new 1600A service serving the Armory Building. The panels serving the Armory Building shall be separately metered.

 * Communications: The City shall install all communications infrastructure as shown on the Phase II plans including four (4) 4" conduits from Valley Street to the telecommunication manholes at the south side of the North Parking Lot. The use of two of these shall be reserved for the exclusive use of the Museum. The City shall also install four (4) 4" conduits and three (3) 2" conduits from the manholes on the south side of the North Parking Lot to a point within the Armory Building. The use of two of the 4" conduits and one of the 2" conduits shall be reserved for the exclusive use of the Museum.

 GROUND LEASE

 This GROUND LEASE ("Lease"), dated as of \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_, 20\_\_\_, is by and between [TAX CREDIT ENTITY], a Washington \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ ("Ground Tenant"), the HISTORICAL SOCIETY OF SEATTLE AND KING COUNTY, a Washington nonprofit corporation ("MOHAI"), and the CITY OF SEATTLE, a Washington municipal corporation ("City").

 RECITALS

 A. City is the owner of that certain improved parcel of real property located in the City of Seattle, King County, Washington legally described on, and also depicted on, Exhibit A hereto, together with all appurtenances, rights and privileges now belonging or appertaining thereto (the "Premises"). The historic Armory Building (the "Armory Building") is located on the Premises. City received the Premises and the Armory Building pursuant to that certain Quit Claim Deed from the United States of America, acting by and through the Department of the Navy, as grantor, to City, as grantee, recorded on September 1, 2000 under AFN 20000901000377, records of King County Washington (the "Federal Deed"). The Armory Building is built on a piling support system (the "Building Pile System").

 B. MOHAI is a Washington nonprofit corporation that has operated the Museum of History and Industry in the Montlake area of Seattle for over fifty (50) years. MOHAI is being displaced from its current Montlake location due to the SR 520 expansion project and MOHAI and City have agreed that the Armory Building is a suitable and desirable site for MOHAI's relocation. Tenant Parties (as defined below) intend to operate a regional history museum as more particularly described in Exhibit E, Section 1 (the "Museum").

 C. To facilitate obtaining certain historic rehabilitation tax credit financing for the rehabilitation of the historic Armory Building, which is the "Project" as defined in the Development Agreement (the "Project"), MOHAI has formed Ground Tenant, which is a subsidiary of MOHAI. MOHAI is currently the sole beneficial owner of Ground Tenant and controls its operations and activities. MOHAI is executing this Lease, not as the tenant but rather to evidence its agreement to provide, directly or indirectly, certain public benefits, generally as described in the Project's development principles, adopted pursuant to Resolution Number 31092, and more specifically described on Exhibit E hereto, and to agree to cause Ground Tenant to perform such public benefit obligations in addition to its other obligations hereunder. MOHAI and Ground Tenant are collectively called "Tenant Parties."

 D. City and MOHAI are parties to that certain Project Development Agreement dated \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_, 2009 (as now or hereafter amended, the "Development Agreement"). Pursuant to the Development Agreement, City has agreed to convey the Armory Building to MOHAI, who will convey it to Ground Tenant (such conveyance, however, to be accomplished via direct deed from City to Ground Tenant) with a covenant that it be used only as a regional history museum.

 E. Following completion of the Project and placement of the Armory Building into service, Ground Tenant will lease the Armory Building to "Master Tenant," an entity formed by a tax credit investor, who will in turn sublease the Armory Building to MOHAI. MOHAI will thereafter operate or cause to be operated the Museum in the Armory Building.

 F. City believes it serves an important public function to have a vibrant and successful Museum at the Armory Building and to see that the Armory Building is maintained over time.

 G. The parties have agreed that this Lease is in the best interests of all parties to facilitate the establishment and operation of the Museum in the new location at the Armory Building. Thus, the parties are entering into this Lease for the Premises on the terms and conditions set forth herein.

 AGREEMENT

 NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the mutual covenants and conditions contained herein, and for other good and valuable consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of which is hereby acknowledged, City, Ground Tenant and MOHAI agree as follows:

 ARTICLE 1

 DESCRIPTION OF THE PREMISES

 1.1 Recitals. The above Recitals are hereby incorporated by this reference.

 1.2 Lease of Premises. Consistent with the Development Agreement, this Lease becomes effective (the "Effective Date") on the date when the Armory Building is conveyed to the Ground Tenant. As of the Effective Date, City as landlord hereby leases to Ground Tenant as tenant, and Ground Tenant hereby leases from City, the Premises, subject to the obligations, terms, and conditions contained herein. The Premises consist of the land and the Building Pile System that supports the Armory Building, as legally described on Exhibit A hereto, and the associated appurtenant rights and easements only (including the easements described below) and do not include the Armory Building. Tenant Parties' right to use and occupy the Premises is subject to City's reserved rights in the Public Use Area as described in Section 1.6.3. The Armory Building has been separately conveyed to Ground Tenant contemporaneously herewith. The purpose of this Lease is to permit the Armory Building to remain on the Premises and to provide for the on-going rights and obligations of the parties with respect to the Armory Building and the Premises for the Term.

 1.3 Tax Credit Structure. In addition to leasing the Armory Building to the Master Tenant, Ground Tenant will sublease the Premises to Master Tenant, both for terms exceeding thirty (30) years. Master Tenant will in turn sublease the Armory Building to MOHAI. Such structure is designed to comply with requirements for historic rehabilitation tax credits and must remain in effect during the period required under the Internal Revenue Code for such credits to be available for tax credit investors (the "Tax Credit Compliance Period").

 1.4 Expansion of Premises. City is in the process of vacating Terry Avenue adjoining the Premises. When such vacation is complete, the portion of Terry Avenue to the centerline thereof adjoining the Premises shall automatically and without further action by the parties become part of the Premises. Following such vacation, Ground Tenant shall be permitted to construct, at its expense and consistent with City-approved plans and any applicable National Park Service requirements, a terrace on the west side of the Armory Building (the "Terrace" in such addition to the Premises.

 1.5 Easements. To operate the Armory Building for Museum purposes, certain easements are required, as hereinafter described. Thus, City hereby grants and conveys to Tenant Parties, their successors and assigns, for the Term, the Construction Easement, the Parking Easement, the Access Easement, the Utility Easement and the Drop-Off Easement (collectively, the "Easements"), on the terms and conditions of this Lease. The memorandum of this Lease that is recorded on the Effective Date shall provide notice of these Easements. The Easements are located on and burden Lake Union Park, or portions thereof surrounding the Premises, owned by City, described on Exhibit B attached hereto, together with Terry Avenue adjoining the Premises and Lake Union Park.

 1.5.1 Construction Easement. "Construction Easement" means an exclusive easement for construction staging activities in the North Parking Lot, which area is depicted on Exhibit C attached hereto. The Construction Easement area shall be reserved for the exclusive use by Tenant Parties, their agents, employees and contractors. Activities permitted in the Construction Easement area shall include parking of construction and contractor vehicles and storage of construction materials to be used in the Project. The Construction Easement shall commence on the date that MOHAI or Ground Tenant authorizes its contractor to proceed with construction of the Project, and terminate when the Project is complete and the Armory Building is placed in service.

 1.5.2 Parking Easement. "Parking Easement" means a non-exclusive easement for vehicular parking (including disabled parking) and a secondary loading dock in the North Parking Lot, which area is depicted on Exhibit C attached hereto. The Parking Easement shall commence when the Construction Easement terminates. Permitted users of the Parking Easement shall include Tenant Parties, their invitees, licensees, employees, contractors, service providers and permitted subtenants and assignees ("Permitted Users"). Emergency vehicles shall be permitted access through the Parking Easement area. Tenant Parties' use of the Parking Easement area shall be consistent with the Lake Union Park parking plan that City's Superintendent of Parks and Recreation ("Superintendent") will develop in consultation with Tenant Parties and other interested parties (the "Parking Plan"). The initial Parking Plan shall be completed as provided in the Development Agreement and must be reasonably acceptable to Tenant Parties. The Parking Plan is subject to review and revision by the Superintendent, in consultation with Tenant Parties and other interested parties; any such revisions and any successor Parking Plans must be reasonably acceptable to Tenant Parties and must be consistent with the Parking Easement rights granted herein and Tenant Parties' rights to use of other parking resources under Section 1.7. The Parking Plan may allocate parking stalls for the exclusive use of Tenant Parties and other Lake Union Park tenants. There shall be no charge to Tenant Parties and the Permitted Users for parking and loading dock use in the Parking Easement and, if the Access Easement described below is gated or otherwise secured so as to restrict access to the Parking Easement area, Permitted Users of the Parking Easement shall be provided with a means of access through such gate or security system. MOHAI shall provide staff to regulate and coordinate vehicular access in and out of the North Parking Lot when either the Museum or the Museum cafe are open to the general public ("Operating Hours") to facilitate loading, special deliveries and disabled parking with respect to the use of the Museum only. Staffing shall not include providing personnel for any security or parking booth at a gated access point.

 1.5.3 Access Easement. "Access Easement" means a non-exclusive easement for access in the area depicted on Exhibit C attached hereto. This right to access shall include all forms of access to the Premises, including access for Permitted Users and access for cars, vans, trucks, construction vehicles, bicycles and pedestrians. If the Access Easement is gated or otherwise secured so as to restrict access, Permitted Users of the Access Easement shall be provided with a means of access through such gate or security system.

 1.5.4 Utility Easement. "Utility Easement" means a non-exclusive easement for all utilities (including electric, water, sewer, communications, cable and gas) serving or to serve the Premises and the Armory Building to provide utility service thereto. Ground Tenant shall be permitted to have a telecommunications provider(s) install its cables in the conduit in the Utility Easement. The Utility Easement shall be for the utilities in the locations where installed or relocated from time to time, which are in Terry Avenue adjoining the Premises and Lake Union Park and in the portions of Lake Union Park described on Exhibit B attached hereto.

 City has previously installed water lines, electric services, sewer lines, conduits for communications, meters, fire department connections and hydrants and other utility facilities to serve the Premises, as described in the Development Agreement. City shall keep these utilities and related facilities installed in the Utility Easement area in good condition and repair at all times at City's sole cost and provide such utility service to the Premises. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Ground Tenant shall be responsible for the portion of the sewer line connecting from the side sewer stub into the Armory Building, and City is not responsible for the communications lines installed by a third party provider at the request of Ground Tenant.

 Ground Tenant may install additional utilities and upgrade or repair utilities in the Utility Easement at its sole cost and with the prior written approval of the Superintendent, which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed. In doing such work, Ground Tenant shall not disturb the vegetation and topography and improvements on the property outside of the Utility Easement area. Upon completion of such reconstruction, maintenance, repair or other permitted activity, Ground Tenant shall immediately restore all disturbed topography and vegetation to their condition immediately prior to the initiation of such maintenance or repair and, as to the installation of any new utilities by Ground Tenant, Ground Tenant shall thereafter be responsible for their maintenance and repair.

 Electrical service to the Armory Building shall be separately metered; water shall be submetered. Tenant Parties shall be responsible for utility charges for their usage. The parties recognize that electric service lines and service that serve the Wharfs and surrounding Lake Union Park are located within the Armory Building; such lines will remain on the Premises. City (by and through City Light) shall have the right to access as needed to maintain, repair and replace such electric lines and service (a) at all times to the Armory Building's electrical service room, which shall be accessible from outside the Building; and (b) to the Armory Building, provided that such persons are accompanied by appropriate MOHAI staff, during Operating Hours or any time, with or without MOHAI staff, if necessitated by an emergency or dangerous condition. Such access shall be conducted in such a way as to minimize interference with the operation of the Museum and activities in the Armory Building and City shall repair any damage caused by such access.

 1.5.5 Drop Off Easement. "Drop Off Easement" means a non- exclusive easement for buses and other vehicles to pick up and drop off visitors to the Premises in the area depicted on Exhibit C attached hereto. Currently, the East Wharf and North Parking Lot are not configured to permit visitor drop off/pick up by school or tour bus. Therefore, Tenant Parties and other Permitted Users may utilize the Valley Parking Lot for such purpose on a non-exclusive basis. Tenant Parties acknowledge that the Valley Parking Lot is a temporary parking lot that may be removed as part of on-going Lake Union Park improvements. Before City were to remove the Valley Parking Lot or make it unavailable for Museum visitor drop off, City and Tenant Parties must agree on and implement a mutually acceptable plan to either: (a) extend the corner of the East Wharf so as to permit bus and other vehicles access to and turnaround from the North Parking Lot; or (b) otherwise provide for MOHAI's need for a bus drop-off. The parties agree to cooperate to develop, identify funding for and implement such a mutually acceptable plan if the need arises, recognizing that providing the Public Benefits described herein depends on having drop off arrangements reasonably acceptable to MOHAI.

 1.6 Building Pile System and Wharfs.

 1.6.1 Maintenance and Reinforcement of Building Pile System. Subject to the provisions of the Development Agreement regarding assessments of the Building Pile System at completion of shell and core construction and contemporaneously with the issuance of a certificate of occupancy for the Museum, and subject to the provisions of Section 9.3 and the qualifications below, from and after the time the Project is complete and a certificate of occupancy is issued for the Museum: (i) City will be responsible for the condition of the Building Pile System and for maintaining it in a safe and sound condition, capable of supporting the Armory Building for its use for Museum and related purposes for the duration of its use as such; and (ii) City will address, at no cost to Tenant Parties, any conditions that impair the ability of the Building Pile System to support the Armory for its intended use for Museum and related purposes for the duration of its use as such.

 Notwithstanding the foregoing, with respect to any (a) alteration to the Armory Building or Premises that affect the Building Pile System; or (b) specific change or addition to exhibitry reasonably likely to affect the Building Pile System, either of which are undertaken after issuance of the certificate of occupancy for the Museum, Ground Tenant and the Superintendent shall reasonably determine the measures, if any, to be undertaken in conjunction with such alteration or exhibitry change or addition that are needed to enable the Building Pile System to continue to support the Armory Building for its intended use for Museum and related purposes. Ground Tenant shall at its expense, complete such measures as a component of its alteration or exhibitry change or addition described in clauses (a) or (b) above. Ground Tenant also will inform the Superintendent of any damage to the Building Pile System incurred during the construction of any alteration or exhibitry change or addition described in clauses (a) or (b) above, together with the measures it proposes to take to repair any such damage, which measures shall be subject to the Superintendent's reasonable approval. Ground Tenant will confirm that such repairs have been completed. All such measures or repairs shall be the property of City upon their completion and shall thereafter be considered part of the Building Pile System (and be maintained, repaired or replaced by City as required herein).

 1.6.2 Loading Docks. Ground Tenant shall be entitled to locate and use its loading dock (including dumpsters) in the area located on the East Wharf as depicted on Exhibit B attached hereto. Ground Tenant shall also be entitled to locate and use its secondary loading dock in the North Parking Lot as also depicted on Exhibits B and C.

 1.6.3 Control, Maintenance and Management of Public Areas. City shall be responsible for the maintenance, repair, replacement, management, regulation and programming of the Wharfs and other public portions of the Premises outside the Armory Building footprint (which footprint shall be deemed to include the concrete steps along and attached to the north side of the Armory Building and the loading dock on the east side of the Armory Building) and Terrace (collectively, the "Public Use Area"). The Public Use Area is depicted on Exhibit D hereto. City shall manage and operate the Public Use Area in a clean, safe and unobstructed manner consistent with the operation of the Museum. Loitering shall not be permitted in the Public Use Areas. Tenant Parties shall not obstruct members of the public from entering upon and using and enjoying the Public Use Area for park purposes except for occasional closures of the Wharfs for Museum events approved by City in advance, and except for temporary construction activities and fencing near the Armory Building in connection with the Project (in locations approved by the Parks Department Project Coordinator identified under the Development Agreement). City will not block or obstruct, or permit the blocking or obstruction of the Public Use Areas (including without limitation the loading docks described in the preceding section, the steps on the north side of the Armory Building and other points of ingress and egress from the Armory Building) or modify the Public Use Areas except for occasional, temporary obstructions for park events. Such obstructions shall not materially interfere with public access to the Museum or Tenant Parties' ability to use the Premises and the Armory Building for their intended purposes. City will consult with Ground Tenant to minimize any impacts from any temporary blockage or obstruction.

 Neither Ground Tenant nor MOHAI shall have any responsibility or liability for the activities on the Wharfs or the condition thereof, unless and to the extent caused by Ground Tenant, MOHAI, or their employees or agents (as further provided in Section 13, Indemnity). In collaboration with MOHAI, the Superintendent shall develop and implement an expeditious procedure for providing MOHAI with the permits necessary for Tenant Parties to use or host the use of the Wharfs adjoining the Armory for MOHAI events on mutually acceptable terms and conditions.

 1.7 Public Parking. In addition to the Parking Easement, visitors to the Museum and the Armory Building shall be permitted to use the Valley Parking Lot (depicted on Exhibit C) and other City owned, controlled and managed parking conveniently located for visitors to Lake Union Park and amenities located therein for parking pursuant to the Parking Plan on a basis no less favorable than City makes it available to other visitors to Lake Union Park.

 1.8 As-Is Condition. Except as specifically required in the Development Agreement or in this Lease, City has no obligation to contribute to the cost of the Project, nor shall City be obligated to perform any construction or make any improvements in connection with the Project, except as provided in this Lease with respect to the Building Pile System. The acceptance of possession of the Premises by Ground Tenant on the Effective Date shall be conclusive evidence that Ground Tenant accepts the Premises in their then "as-is" condition, subject to City's obligation in the Development Agreement to provide a clean and empty building, free and clear of tenants and their personal property. Ground Tenant hereby acknowledges that City has made and makes no representations or warranties, express or implied, regarding the condition of the Premises or their suitability for the intended use. Ground Tenant confirms that it has had ample opportunity to inspect the Premises and is  familiar with their condition.

 1.9 Signage. Tenant Parties shall have the right to place informational and directional signage in Lake Union Park (but outside of the Premises) to inform the public about the location of and access to the Museum, with the Superintendent's prior written consent. Tenant Parties shall develop for the Superintendent's approval a signage plan for the installation of appropriate signage for the Museum within Lake Union Park (but outside of the Premises). In determining whether to approve such signage plan the Superintendent may consider, among other factors, Tenant Parties' needs for public awareness of the location of and access to the Museum; the signage needs of other Lake Union Park tenants and uses; the design, scale, placement and materials proposed for such signage; and compatibility of the proposed signage with other Lake Union installations. Tenant Parties may request modifications of the signage plan from time to time, such changes are also subject to the approval of the Superintendent.

 The parties recognize that the Project will entail installation of a signage system for the Armory Building and Terrace, which system will be approved by the Superintendent pursuant to the Development Agreement. The signage system will support a continuing display of banners and signs advertising events and exhibits at the Premises and the presence of the Museum. Such banners and signs shall not be subject to approval by the Superintendent and need not conform to sign regulations for Lake Union Park, so long as they relate to the Museum and events and exhibits at the Museum. In addition, Tenant Parties may install temporary signage at the entrance to Lake Union Park on Valley Street, to advertise special events on the Premises, subject to the approval of the Superintendent as to size, location and content.

 1.10 Covenant and Warranty of Quiet Possession. City covenants and warrants that Ground Tenant's peaceable and quiet occupation, use and enjoyment of the Premises shall not be disturbed by City or anyone claiming by or through City. City shall defend at its expense any third party claims asserted that would interfere with Ground Tenant's (and its permitted successors and assigns) right to such occupancy, use, and enjoyment of the Premises or City's title to the Premises.

 3.2 Redevelopment and Maintenance. Tenant Parties shall rehabilitate and redevelop the Armory Building to be suitable for Museum uses as provided in the Development Agreement. From and after the date the Armory Building is placed in service, the relocation of the Museum displays to the Armory Building and the opening of the Museum in the Armory Building to the public ("Opening Date"), Tenant Parties shall ensure that the Armory Building is maintained in good operating condition and state of repair and in a condition suitable for the Public Benefits to be provided, subject to the terms and conditions of this Lease as further described in Section 6.2 below.

MOHAI may use any portion of the Armory Building for its purposes when the Armory Building is not open to the general public. Nothing herein shall limit Tenant Parties' ability to regulate use of the cafe, restrooms or other facilities consistent with Museum security needs or to address unruly or inappropriate behavior.

 3.5.2 Continuing Use of Montlake Facility. MOHAI may for some period of time maintain storage, office, public assembly and other space at the Montlake location as the transition to the Armory Building occurs.

Following the Opening Date, MOHAI shall pay all operations and maintenance costs for the Montlake facility during the time it continues to be occupied exclusively by MOHAI or on a pro rata basis with City if the use is shared between MOHAI and City. If the facility is not removed from service by WSDOT immediately upon MOHAI's vacation, the auditorium and other primary public assembly spaces within the Montlake facility shall be available for City Parks and Recreation Department-related uses as well as MOHAI uses (subject to WSDOT consent) and MOHAI and City shall develop a protocol for programming such spaces.

 3.6 Property Operating Expenses. Ground Tenant and/or MOHAI shall bear all costs and expenses during the Term that are associated with the improvement, restoration, repair, remodeling, replacement, maintenance, operation, lease and management of the Armory Building and the Museum (the "Property Operation Activities") on an absolute net basis.

 As of the Effective Date, Tenant Parties shall be responsible for direct payment of all Property Operating Expenses accruing from and after the Effective Date as and when any such expenses are due. The parties shall cooperate to arrange for direct billing of all Property Operating Expenses from the service provider to Ground Tenant (to the extent practical; for example water service will be submetered from City's meter).

 3.7 Real Estate Taxes. Ground Tenant shall bear all cost and expense of any taxes and assessments related to the Premises accruing during the Term, including without any limitation the following (collectively, "Real Estate Taxes"):

 3.7.1 General real estate taxes levied against the Armory Building or taxes in lieu thereof;

 3.7.2 Special assessments or taxes in the nature of improvement or betterment assessments;

The parties may agree to implement direct billing of all Real Estate Taxes to Ground Tenant or MOHAI, with appropriate notice to City. All Real Estate Taxes that are payable by Tenant Parties pursuant hereto for the tax year in which the Term commences, as well as during the year in which the Term expires, shall be prorated between City and Tenant Parties on an actual per diem basis. If any of the Real Estate Taxes that either of Tenant Parties is obligated to pay in whole or in part is permitted by law to be paid in installments, Tenant Parties may pay the taxes in installments. Any exemption for property tax, in lieu tax or leasehold excise tax will accrue to the benefit of Tenant Parties (i.e., it will have no obligation to pay such taxes under this Section 3.7 to the extent of such exemption).

 Tenant Parties may contest the validity or amount, including the assessed valuation upon the Premises, of any Real Estate Taxes that they in good faith believe is excessive, improper or invalid. In such event, the payment thereof may be deferred during the pendency of such contest, if diligently prosecuted. City agrees to join at Tenant Parties' request in any such contest to the extent such joinder is a prerequisite to such prosecution under statute, regulation or administrative practice. In connection with a judicial or administrative challenge to any assessment, Tenant Parties may take advantage of any stay in collection available under statute, regulation, or court or administrative order or rules. Nothing herein contained, however, shall be so construed as to allow such items to remain unpaid for such length of time as shall permit the Premises, or any part thereof, to be sold by any governmental authority for the nonpayment of the taxes. Within thirty (30) days after the amount of such contested item is finally determined to be due, Tenant Parties shall pay the amounts so determined, together with any penalties, interest and expenses associated with such contest.

Such alterations include, without limitation, the Project and the construction of the Terrace in the vacated portion of Terry Avenue that becomes part of the Premises. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Tenant Parties shall not make any alterations to the Armory Building or the Premises that affect the Building Pile System, the Wharfs or the Armory Building public entry and amenities (i.e., cafe and cafe restrooms) without City's prior written consent, which will not be unreasonably withheld.

Tenant Parties hereby waive all claims for damages that may be caused by City re-entering and taking possession of the Premises or removing and storing Tenant Parties' property as herein provided. No such reentry shall be considered or construed to be a forcible entry.

 Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing herein shall give City any right whatsoever to the Museum Property, as further provided in Section 8 below.

 5.3 Alteration Construction. In conducting any construction work on the Premises, Tenant Parties shall cause all work to be done in a good and workmanlike manner and shall comply with or cause compliance with all Laws.

Tenant Parties shall conduct or cause to be conducted the Museum operations on the Premises in compliance with all terms and conditions of this Lease.

 6.2 Maintenance and Repair By Tenant Parties. Ground Tenant, at its sole cost and expense (as between Ground Tenant and City), without cost or charge to or contribution by City, shall be responsible for and shall perform all improvements, repairs, replacements, restoration and maintenance to the Armory Building throughout the Term. Following completion of the Project, Ground Tenant shall at all times maintain the Armory Building in good operational order, condition and repair. If Ground Tenant fails to perform its obligations under this section following sixty (60) days' prior written notice (or such shorter period as may be necessitated by an emergency or dangerous condition, or such longer time as may be needed provided that Ground Tenant is diligently pursuing the necessary work) from City to Tenant Parties, City may perform such work and Tenant Parties shall be responsible for reimbursing City for the cost thereof.

 Upon completion of the Project, Tenant Parties will provide City with a long-term maintenance plan for the Armory Building. Every five (5) years thereafter, Tenant Parties will provide City with a report on its performance against the plan during the preceding five (5) years, as well as an updated long-term maintenance plan. With the submission of each plan, Tenant Parties will demonstrate to City's reasonable satisfaction that they have or will have sufficient resources to meet their responsibilities identified in the long-term maintenance plan.

 6.3 Maintenance of Historic Features. The Armory Building exterior contains certain historic elements and features (the "Historic Features"). The Historic Features are described in (i) the Federal Deed; and (ii) the Armory Building's landmark listings with the City of Seattle Landmarks Preservation Board and the National Register of Historic Places. Tenant Parties, at their sole cost and expense (as between Tenant Parties and City), without cost or charge to or contribution by City, shall be responsible for and shall perform all improvements, repairs, restoration and maintenance of the Historic Features throughout the Term required by and in compliance with the Historic Requirements. The "Historic Requirements" are those imposed by the Deed, the National Register of Historic Places and the City of Seattle Landmarks Preservation Board, all with regard to the Historic Features.

 Notwithstanding the foregoing, with respect to any measures or repairs with respect to the Building Pile System undertaken by Ground Tenant after issuance of a certificate of occupancy for the Museum pursuant to Section 1.6.1 in connection with (a) alterations to the Armory Building or Premises that affect the Building Pile System; or (b) specific changes or additions to exhibitry reasonably likely to affect the Building Pile System, such measures or repairs shall be considered part of the Building Pile System upon their completion (and be maintained, repaired or replaced by City as required herein).

 6.5 Operating Support.

 6.5.1 City will contribute on an annual basis by April 1 of each year during the Term the amount of Three Hundred Thousand Dollars ($300,000) to MOHAI (or, at MOHAI's direction, to Ground Tenant) to be used to help defray the costs of operating, maintaining and repairing the Armory Building (the "Support Payments"). MOHAI shall separately account for the Support Payments and shall use them solely to pay operating and maintenance expenses for the Armory Building. MOHAI shall keep complete and accurate records and books of account with respect to all expenditures from the Support Payments account and shall provide City with copies of relevant records reasonably promptly upon City request.

 6.5.2 If City reasonably determines that Tenant Parties have failed to maintain the Armory Building in good condition and repair as measured by their performance under the maintenance plan described in Section 6.2 above, then City may withhold the Support Payments until such time as Tenant Parties complete the necessary maintenance and repairs. City will reimburse Tenant Parties for the cost of such maintenance and repairs, up to the total amount of the withheld Support Payments, upon Tenant Parties' presentation of an invoice therefor.

 6.6 Placement of Artifacts in the Park. From time to time, MOHAI may request that certain of its artifacts be placed in the Lake Union Park surrounding the Armory Building or on the Wharfs. Such a request shall be in writing and accompanied by details of the nature and proposed location of the artifact and the plans for installation. If approved by City in its sole discretion, MOHAI shall be responsible for the cost of installation and maintenance of the artifact. The placement of such artifact in Lake Union Park or on the Wharfs shall be at the risk of MOHAI and City shall not be responsible for any damage to or loss of such artifact. Following installation, MOHAI may remove the artifact at its discretion.

 6.7 Maritime Heritage Group. Pursuant to the Development Agreement, City has organized the Maritime Heritage Group among City, MOHAI and certain other maritime heritage organizations resident at South Lake Union. The Maritime Heritage Group is documented through agreements between the various organizations and City establishing the basis for an ongoing collaboration on cultural, educational and recreational maritime- related activities. Through the Maritime Heritage Group, the parties envision an integrated Museum and historic ship visitor experience that enhances Lake Union Park and the Historic Wharf and encourages knowledge and support for the preservation of the region's diverse history, particularly including its maritime history. City, by and through its Superintendent, will be responsible for management, at City's expense, of the Maritime Heritage Group.

 MOHAI will cooperate with the other maritime heritage participants in the Maritime Heritage Group and will participate in the Maritime Heritage Group. MOHAI will enter into collaborative agreements from time to time as desirable and appropriate with the Center for Wooden Boats, Northwest Seaport and the Virginia V Foundation (and with similar organizations in the event the foregoing named entities' presence at South Lake Union ends) relating to, among other things, marketing, programming and reasonable shared use of appropriate Museum facilities for public accommodations (such as ticketing, merchandizing and way-finding facilities).

All Rebuilding shall be done in consultation with City and the plans therefor shall be subject to City's reasonable approval. Nothing herein shall require Tenant Parties to repair and restore damage to Museum Property.

 If Ground Tenant will be restoring the Armory Building, then Ground Tenant shall apply for any permits or approvals required in connection with such Rebuilding diligently after the applicable insurance claims have been adjusted and proceeds thereof made available to Ground Tenant and other funding, if necessary, has been arranged, and after City has approved of the plans for Rebuilding.

 ARTICLE 10

 CONDEMNATION

 10.1 Taking. "Taking" means a taking by condemnation or by the exercise of the power of eminent domain by a public or quasi-public authority or entity, whether or not there is a taking of title, or a conveyance in lieu thereof. If there is a taking of the entire Premises and the Armory Building, then this Lease shall terminate as of the earlier of the date title to the Premises is transferred or the date Ground Tenant is dispossessed by the Taking authority. City agrees not to exercise its eminent domain rights with respect to the Premises or the Armory Building during the Tax Credit Compliance Period.

 City further agrees that in any Taking by City pursuant to its power of eminent domain that results in the termination of this Lease, the measure of the damages to Ground Tenant for the value of the Armory Building shall be the cost to replace such facility, meaning funds sufficient to pay for a substitute facility of at least equal size, function, and capacity.

 10.2 Termination for Material Interference. If there is a Taking of part of the Premises or Armory Building that in Tenant Parties' reasonable judgment materially interferes with Tenant Parties' ability to use the Premises for the purposes set forth herein, which interference cannot be feasibly, economically, operationally or legally remediated, then Ground Tenant shall have the right to terminate this Lease by giving City notice of its election within sixty (60) days after the Taking. If this Lease is so terminated, then it shall terminate on the earlier of the date when title is transferred, the date Ground Tenant is dispossessed by the Taking authority or thirty (30) days following Ground Tenant's notice; provided that such termination shall in no event extinguish or diminish Ground Tenant's right under Section 10.3 to receive a portion of the award payable on account of the Taking.

 If the Taking does not materially interfere with Tenant Parties' ability to operate the Premises for the purposes set forth in this Lease, then this Lease shall continue in full force and effect as to the part not taken, except that Ground Tenant need not operate a Museum or provide the Public Benefits in the space so taken.

 10.3 Taking Award. The parties are entitled to the following portions of any award or settlement in lieu thereof payable on account of a Taking:

 (a) City shall be entitled to all amounts attributable to the value of the land comprising the Premises; and

 (b) Ground Tenant shall be entitled to receive:

 (i) All amounts attributable to the value of the Armory Building provided that such funds are used for a replacement facility for a regional history museum in Seattle. Such replacement facility shall be of comparable scale and quality to the Armory Building Museum. MOHAI shall provide public benefits at the replacement facility consistent with those enumerated in Exhibit E for not less than the remaining term of this Lease or 40 years, whichever is longer. In selecting the location for a replacement facility, Tenant Parties shall give priority consideration to a leasehold interest in any suitable City-owned site or facility that City may propose for such purpose. The term of the MOHAI lease in any such City-owned site or facility shall be long enough to justify the investment that will be necessary to replace the Museum and in no event less than the remaining term of this Lease when the Armory Building is taken;

 (ii) All amounts attributable Museum Property; and

 (iii) Tenant Parties' relocation expenses.

 If MOHAI has not started construction on a replacement facility for a regional history museum in Seattle within seven (7) years after the Taking and payment of the Taking proceeds to MOHAI (with such extensions as City may grant in its reasonable discretion), then the Taking proceeds described in Section 10.3(b)(i) above shall be contributed to City and MOHAI shall have no further claim to them. The provisions of this Section 10 shall survive expiration or termination of this Lease.

 ARTICLE 11

 ACCESS TO PREMISES

 11.1 Access. City and City's agents, employees, and representatives shall have the right to access, enter and inspect the Premises and the Armory Building at any reasonable time during the Operating Hours or when Museum staff is on Premises to escort the inspector for the purpose of ascertaining the condition of the Premises or the Armory Building, monitoring compliance with this Lease or for any other purpose permitted under the terms of this Lease. City understands that Museum operating requirements prohibit unaccompanied, unsupervised access (including inspection), except as specifically provided herein. City, in its capacity as the landlord under this Lease, shall have the right to enter the Armory Building only upon reasonable prior notice to Tenant Parties. In exercising such rights, the parties shall cooperate and shall take all reasonable steps to avoid disruption or unnecessary interference with Tenant Parties' use and operations of the Premises.

Such insurance shall provide coverage for Tenant Parties' premises and operations and contractual liability assumed in Article 13. Tenant Parties shall cause their Commercial General Liability insurer to name City as an additional insured under such insurance and such policy shall contain a severability of interests provision, a provision that the insurance provided to City as additional insured shall be primary to and not contributory with insurance maintained by City, and a provision that an act or omission of one of the insureds or additional insureds that would void or otherwise reduce coverage shall not reduce or void the coverage as to the other named and additional insureds.

 12.2 Premises Property Insurance.

Certificates of insurance evidencing that the insurance required under this section is in effect shall be delivered to City before any entry on the Premises by Tenant Parties, and shall be kept current throughout the Term.

This waiver applies regardless of the cause or origin of the claim including without limitation loss due to the negligent acts or omissions of City or Tenant Parties, or their respective officers, directors, council members, employees, agents, contractors, invitees, Tenant Parties' assignees or subtenants. The parties shall have their property insurers endorse the applicable insurance policies to reflect the foregoing waiver of claims, provided however, that the endorsement shall not be required if the applicable policy of insurance permits the named insured to waive rights of subrogation on a blanket basis, in which case the blanket waiver shall be acceptable.

 12.6 Limitation of Tenant's Liability. In no event shall City, its successors or assigns, have any recourse whatsoever for any damages payable, obligations assumed or indemnifications proffered by Tenant Parties under this Lease to (a) the Museum Property, endowment, archives or other property of MOHAI; (b) funds and pledges of funds raised by MOHAI for the Project or operation of the Museum; (c) proceeds, rents or other income derived, arising from or attributable to the Armory Building or Museum, excluding insurance or condemnation proceeds; or (d) any claims for relief related to the Armory Building or the Project, including claims arising under the insurance policies required to be carried under this Lease or actually carried by Tenant Parties, except as provided in Section 9.1 above.

 15.3 City Exigent Circumstances.

No waiver by any party of any breach of any provisions of this Lease shall be deemed a waiver of a breach of any other provision of this Lease or a consent to any subsequent breach of any other provision. If any action of any party requires the consent or approval of another, consent or approval given on one occasion shall not be deemed a consent to or approval of that action on any other occasion.

Increase, reduce, and change in any manner whatsoever the number, appearance, dimension, and locations of Lake Union Park walks, buildings, landscaping, parking, and service areas, and make improvements, alterations, and additions to the portions of the Premises that are located outside of the Armory Building footprint.

 19.16.5 Days and Hours for Operations. Determine the hours Lake Union Park will be open to the public.

 MOHAI Public Benefits

 The Museum of History and Industry is committed to preserving and sharing the rich and diverse history of Seattle and its region with residents of and visitors to the city as well as to presenting exhibits and programs from institutions around the country that illuminate our shared national heritage. In partial consideration for the public support for the development of its new regional history museum at the Armory Building in Seattle's Lake Union Park and in fulfillment of its mission and ongoing commitment to the community, Ground Tenant and MOHAI (which for purposes of this Exhibit shall include any successor operator of the Museum) agrees that from and after the Opening Date of the Museum through the Term of the Lease, it will:

 1. Regional History Museum. Cause the Armory Building to be operated as an integrated, publicly accessible regional history museum with exhibits and programs devoted primarily to the history, culture, industry, commerce and maritime heritage of the Puget Sound region and the Pacific Northwest, including related space for meeting and educational functions, book store/gift shop and cafe.

 2. Opening Hours and General Admissions. Operate the Museum in the Armory Building at least fifty (50) hours per week, fifty (50) weeks per year, subject to the following admissions policy:

 (a) General public admission will be subject to reasonable standard admission charges;

 (b) Every day the Museum is open, any member of the public unable to pay the standard admission fee will be admitted (excluding special events) upon payment of whatever amount he or she determines he or she can pay. MOHAI will include this policy in its written admissions policies, including indication of this policy on its website;

 (c) At least one (1) day per calendar month will be regularly scheduled when admission to the Museum (excluding special events) is free of charge to all visitors; and

 (d) Children of elementary and middle school age (fourteen (14) years or younger) will be admitted free of charge every day the Museum is open. This excludes school and group admissions and special events.

 3. School Programs. Develop and offer on-going educational programs for elementary, middle and high school classrooms and provide reduced fee and other scholarship assistance to students from schools that participate in federal free or reduced price school lunch programs. In the event regional or other programs provide scholarship or transportation benefits to students from schools, MOHAI will participate in such programs.

 4. Cultural Diversity in Programming. Develop and implement programs and enrichment opportunities of interest to particular segments of the public by ensuring a robust slate of culturally diverse programming throughout the year, consistent with its traditional role in sharing and presenting the history of African Americans, Asian and Pacific Islander Americans, Hispanic Americans, Native Americans and others. To this end, MOHAI's programs and exhibits will incorporate the perspectives and stories of the entire Seattle community.

 5. City Use. Make the Museum available for up to four public events each year, identified by City and scheduled to the mutual convenience of the parties. Such events cannot unreasonably interfere with the operation of the Museum. The group sponsoring such events must be either City or an organized nonprofit corporation and such event sponsor must execute a use agreement required by Tenant Parties including appropriate indemnities and agreement to pay for costs as hereafter described. There shall be no facility rental fee for such events, but MOHAI shall be compensated for (and may required advance payment of) audio/visual, after hours or special security or staffing, catering and other event special needs and costs, if MOHAI elects to provide the same. MOHAI will also allow City to make occasional use of the Terrace for events in Lake Union Park, subject to the terms and conditions for the four events described in this paragraph.

 6. Meeting Space. Provide meeting room space for noncommercial use by South Lake Union community organizations for up to thirty (30) hours per month on a first-come, first-served basis, during hours when the Museum is open to the public, and subject to demand for such meeting space, MOHAI's rules regarding use of such space and MOHAI's scheduling convenience and execution of use agreements required by Tenant Parties (including appropriate indemnities and agreement to pay for costs as hereafter described). The parties recognize that separate, dedicated meeting space will not be included in the Project design and such meetings would need to occur in Museum areas that also serve other functions. There shall be no facility rental fee for such meetings, but MOHAI shall be compensated for (and may require advance payment of) audio/visual, special security or staffing, special set up and other event special needs and costs, if MOHAI elects to provide the same. MOHAI shall publicize the availability of such meeting space by, at a minimum, posting notice thereof in a prominent position on its website.

 7. Public Restrooms. Make available for public use restrooms in the cafe to be located in the Armory Building during Operating Hours without requiring payment of Museum admission charges.

 8. City Staff Work Space. Make available work space for regular use by City staff during Operating Hours or when Museum staff is on Premises in connection with the operation and maintenance of the Lake Union Park and the Maritime Heritage Group.

 9. Publicly Accessible Cafe. Design and cause the cafe to be operated so as to serve not only the Museum but Lake Union Park users generally. The cafe's open hours (if less than normal Museum open hours, exclusive of special events) and access policies (if any) shall be subject to the review and approval of the Superintendent, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld.

 10. Emergency Use. Tenant Parties acknowledge that Lake Union Park and the Armory Building have been designated as "Tier 2 Sheltering Sites" in City's Emergency Response Plan and that use of the Armory Building for Museum purposes may be impacted in the event of a declared emergency. City and Tenant Parties shall develop a protocol concerning any such use, providing for management of the Premises during a declared emergency and City responsibility for any cost, damage or liability associated with such use.

 This LEASE ("Lease"), dated as of \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_, 20\_\_\_, is by and between the HISTORICAL SOCIETY OF SEATTLE AND KING COUNTY, a Washington nonprofit corporation ("MOHAI"), and the CITY OF SEATTLE, a Washington municipal corporation ("City").

 RECITALS

 A. City is the owner of that certain improved parcel of real property located in the City of Seattle, King County, Washington legally described on, and also depicted on, Exhibit A hereto, together with all appurtenances, rights and privileges now belonging or appertaining thereto (the "Premises"). The historic Armory Building (the "Armory Building") is part of the Premises.

The Armory Building is built on a piling support system (the "Building Pile System").

 B. MOHAI is a Washington nonprofit corporation that has operated the Museum of History and Industry in the Montlake area of Seattle for over fifty (50) years. MOHAI is being displaced from its current Montlake location due to the SR 520 expansion project and MOHAI and City have agreed that the Armory Building is a suitable and desirable site for MOHAI's relocation. MOHAI (as defined below) intends to operate a regional history museum as more particularly described in Exhibit E, Section 1 (the "Museum").

 C. To facilitate the rehabilitation of the historic Armory Building, which is the "Project" as defined in the Development Agreement (the "Project"), MOHAI is executing this Lease as the tenant and to evidence its agreement to provide, directly or indirectly, certain public benefits, generally as described in the Project's development principles, adopted pursuant to Resolution Number 31092, and more specifically described on Exhibit E hereto, and to agree to perform such public benefit obligations in addition to its other obligations hereunder.

 D. City and MOHAI are parties to that certain Project Development Agreement dated \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_, 2009 (as now or hereafter amended, the "Development Agreement"). Pursuant to the Development Agreement, City has agreed to lease the Premises, including the Armory Building, to MOHAI.

 E. Following completion of the Project and placement of the Armory Building into service, MOHAI will thereafter operate the Museum in the Armory Building.

 F. City believes it serves an important public function to have a vibrant and successful Museum at the Armory Building and to see that the Armory Building is maintained over time.

 G. The parties have agreed that this Lease is in the best interests of all parties to facilitate the establishment and operation of the Museum in the new location at the Armory Building. Thus, the parties are entering into this Lease for the Premises on the terms and conditions set forth herein.

 AGREEMENT

The initial Parking Plan shall be completed as provided in the Development Agreement and must be reasonably acceptable to MOHAI. The Parking Plan is subject to review and revision by the Superintendent, in consultation with MOHAI and other interested parties; any such revisions and any successor Parking Plans must be reasonably acceptable to MOHAI and must be consistent with the Parking Easement rights granted herein and MOHAI's rights to use of other parking resources under Section 1.7. The Parking Plan may allocate parking stalls for the exclusive use of MOHAI and other Lake Union Park tenants. There shall be no charge to MOHAI and the Permitted Users for parking and loading dock use in the Parking Easement and, if the Access Easement described below is gated or otherwise secured so as to restrict access to the Parking Easement area, Permitted Users of the Parking Easement shall be provided with a means of access through such gate or security system. MOHAI shall provide staff to regulate and coordinate vehicular access in and out of the North Parking Lot when either the Museum or the Museum cafe are open to the general public ("Operating Hours") to facilitate loading, special deliveries and disabled parking with respect to the use of the Museum only. Staffing shall not include providing personnel for any security or parking booth at a gated access point.

 1.5.3 Access Easement. "Access Easement" means a non-exclusive easement for access in the area depicted on Exhibit C attached hereto. This right to access shall include all forms of access to the Premises, including access for Permitted Users and access for cars, vans, trucks, construction vehicles, bicycles and pedestrians. If the Access Easement is gated or otherwise secured so as to restrict access, Permitted Users of the Access Easement shall be provided with a means of access through such gate or security system.

 1.5.4 Utility Easement. "Utility Easement" means a non-exclusive easement for all utilities (including electric, water, sewer, communications, cable and gas) serving or to serve the Premises and the Armory Building to provide utility service thereto. MOHAI shall be permitted to have a telecommunications provider(s) install its cables in the conduit in the Utility Easement. The Utility Easement shall be for the utilities in the locations where installed or relocated from time to time, which are in Terry Avenue adjoining the Premises and Lake Union Park and in the portions of Lake Union Park described on Exhibit B attached hereto.

 City has previously installed water lines, electric services, sewer lines and pipes, conduits for communications, meters, fire department connections and hydrants and other utility facilities to serve the Premises, as described in the Development Agreement. City shall keep these utilities and related facilities installed in the Utility Easement area in good condition and repair at all times at City's sole cost and provide such utility service to the Premises. Notwithstanding the foregoing, MOHAI shall be responsible for the portion of the sewer line connecting from the side sewer stub into the Armory Building, and City is not responsible for the communications lines installed by a third party provider at the request of MOHAI.

 MOHAI may install additional utilities and upgrade or repair utilities in the Utility Easement at its sole cost and with the prior written approval of the Superintendent, which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed. In doing such work, MOHAI shall not disturb the vegetation and topography and improvements on the property outside of the Utility Easement area. Upon completion of such reconstruction, maintenance, repair or other permitted activity, MOHAI shall immediately restore all disturbed topography and vegetation to their condition immediately prior to the initiation of such maintenance or repair and, as to the installation of any new utilities by MOHAI, MOHAI shall thereafter be responsible for their maintenance and repair.

 Electrical service to the Armory Building shall be separately metered; water shall be submetered. MOHAI shall be responsible for utility charges for their usage. The parties recognize that electric service lines and service that serve the Wharfs and surrounding Lake Union Park are located within the Armory Building; such lines will remain on the Premises. City (by and through City Light) shall have the right to access as needed to maintain, repair and replace such electric lines and service (a) at all times to the Armory Building's electrical service room, which shall be accessible from outside the Building; and (b) to the Armory Building, provided that such persons are accompanied by appropriate MOHAI staff, during Operating Hours or any time, with or without MOHAI staff, if necessitated by an emergency or dangerous condition. Such access shall be conducted in such a way as to minimize interference with the operation of the Museum and activities in the Armory Building and City shall repair any damage caused by such access.

 1.5.5 Drop Off Easement. "Drop Off Easement" means a non- exclusive easement for buses and other vehicles to pick up and drop off visitors to the Premises in the area depicted on Exhibit C attached hereto. Currently, the East Wharf and North Parking Lot are not configured to permit visitor drop off/pick up by school or tour bus. Therefore, MOHAI and other Permitted Users may utilize the Valley Parking Lot for such purpose on a non-exclusive basis. MOHAI acknowledges that the Valley Parking Lot is a temporary parking lot that may be removed as part of on-going Lake Union Park improvements. Before City were to remove the Valley Parking Lot or make it unavailable for Museum visitor drop off, City and MOHAI must agree on and implement a mutually acceptable plan to either: (a) extend the corner of the East Wharf so as to permit bus and other vehicles access to and turnaround from the North Parking Lot; or (b) otherwise provide for MOHAI's need for a bus drop-off. The parties agree to cooperate to develop, identify funding for and implement such a mutually acceptable plan if the need arises, recognizing that providing the Public Benefits described herein depends on having drop off arrangements reasonably acceptable to MOHAI.

 1.6 Building Pile System and Wharfs.

 1.6.1 Maintenance and Reinforcement of Building Pile System. Subject to the provisions of the Development Agreement regarding assessments of the Building Pile System at completion of shell and core construction and contemporaneously with the issuance of a certificate of occupancy for the Museum, and subject to the provisions of Section 9.3 and the qualifications below, from and after the time the Project is complete and a certificate of occupancy is issued for the Museum: (i) City will be responsible for the condition of the Building Pile System and for maintaining it in a safe and sound condition, capable of supporting the Armory Building for its use for Museum and related purposes for the duration of its use as such; and (ii) City will address, at no cost to MOHAI, any conditions that impair the ability of the Building Pile System to support the Armory for its intended use for Museum and related purposes for the duration of its use as such.

 Notwithstanding the foregoing, with respect to any (a) alteration to the Armory Building or Premises that affect the Building Pile System; or (b) specific change or addition to exhibitry reasonably likely to affect the Building Pile System, either of which are undertaken after issuance of the certificate of occupancy for the Museum, MOHAI and the Superintendent shall reasonably determine the measures, if any, to be undertaken in conjunction with such alteration or exhibitry change or addition that are needed to enable the Building Pile System to continue to support the Armory Building for its intended use for Museum and related purposes. MOHAI shall at its expense, complete such measures as a component of its alteration or exhibitry change or addition described in clauses (a) or (b) above. MOHAI also will inform the Superintendent of any damage to the Building Pile System incurred during the construction of any alteration or exhibitry change or addition described in clauses (a) or (b) above, together with the measures it proposes to take to repair any such damage, which measures shall be subject to the Superintendent's reasonable approval. MOHAI will confirm that such repairs have been completed. All such measures or repairs shall be the property of City upon their completion and shall thereafter be considered part of the Building Pile System (and be maintained, repaired or replaced by City as required herein).

 1.6.2 Loading Docks. MOHAI shall be entitled to locate and use its loading dock (including dumpsters) in the area located on the East Wharf as depicted on Exhibit B attached hereto. MOHAI shall also be entitled to locate and use its secondary loading dock in the North Parking Lot as also depicted on Exhibits B and C.

 1.6.3 Control, Maintenance and Management of Public Areas. City shall be responsible for the maintenance, repair, replacement, management, regulation and programming of the Wharfs and other public portions of the Premises outside the Armory Building footprint (which footprint shall be deemed to include the concrete steps along and attached to the north side of the Armory Building and the loading dock on the east side of the Armory Building) and Terrace (collectively, the "Public Use Area"). The Public Use Area is depicted on Exhibit D hereto. City shall manage and operate the Public Use Area in a clean, safe and unobstructed manner consistent with the operation of the Museum. Loitering shall not be permitted in the Public Use Areas. MOHAI shall not obstruct members of the public from entering upon and using and enjoying the Public Use Area for park purposes except for occasional closures of the Wharfs for Museum events approved by City in advance, and except for temporary construction activities and fencing near the Armory Building in connection with the Project (in locations approved by the Parks Department Project Coordinator identified under the Development Agreement). City will not block or obstruct, or permit the blocking or obstruction of the Public Use Areas (including without limitation the loading docks described in the preceding section, the steps on the north side of the Armory Building and other points of ingress and egress from the Armory Building) or modify the Public Use Areas except for occasional, temporary obstructions for park events. Such obstructions shall not materially interfere with public access to the Museum or MOHAI's ability to use the Premises and the Armory Building for their intended purposes. City will consult with MOHAI to minimize any impacts from any temporary blockage or obstruction.

 MOHAI shall not have any responsibility or liability for the activities on the Wharfs or the condition thereof, unless and to the extent caused by MOHAI, or its employees or agents (as further provided in Section 13, Indemnity). In collaboration with MOHAI, the Superintendent shall develop and implement an expeditious procedure for providing MOHAI with the permits necessary for MOHAI to use or host the use of the Wharfs adjoining the Armory for MOHAI events on mutually acceptable terms and conditions.

 1.7 Public Parking. In addition to the Parking Easement, visitors to the Museum and the Armory Building shall be permitted to use the Valley Parking Lot (depicted on Exhibit C) and other City owned, controlled and managed parking conveniently located for visitors to Lake Union Park and amenities located therein for parking pursuant to the Parking Plan on a basis no less favorable than City makes it available to other visitors to Lake Union Park.

 1.8 As-Is Condition. Except as specifically required in the Development Agreement or in this Lease, City has no obligation to contribute to the cost of the Project, nor shall City be obligated to perform any construction or make any improvements in connection with the Project, except as provided in this Lease with respect to the Building Pile System. The acceptance of possession of the Premises by MOHAI on the Effective Date shall be conclusive evidence that MOHAI accepts the Premises in their then "as-is" condition, subject to City's obligation in the Development Agreement to provide a clean and empty building, free and clear of tenants and their personal property. MOHAI hereby acknowledges that City has made and makes no representations or warranties, express or implied, regarding the condition of the Premises or their suitability for the intended use. MOHAI confirms that it has had ample opportunity to inspect the Premises and is familiar with their condition.

 1.9 Signage. MOHAI shall have the right to place informational and directional signage in Lake Union Park (but outside of the Premises) to inform the public about the location of and access to the Museum, with the Superintendent's prior written consent. MOHAI shall develop for the Superintendent's approval a signage plan for the installation of appropriate signage for the Museum within Lake Union Park (but outside of the Premises). In determining whether to approve such signage plan the Superintendent may consider, among other factors, MOHAI's needs for public awareness of the location of and access to the Museum; the signage needs of other Lake Union Park tenants and uses; the design, scale, placement and materials proposed for such signage; and compatibility of the proposed signage with other Lake Union installations. MOHAI may request modifications of the signage plan from time to time, such changes are also subject to the approval of the Superintendent as to size, location and content.

 The parties recognize that the Project will entail installation of a signage system for the Armory Building and Terrace, which system will be approved by the Superintendent pursuant to the Development Agreement. The signage system will support a continuing display of banners and signs advertising events and exhibits at the Premises and the presence of the Museum. Such banners and signs shall not be subject to approval by the Superintendent and need not conform to sign regulations for Lake Union Park, so long as they relate to the Museum and events and exhibits at the Museum. In addition, MOHAI may install temporary signage at the entrance to Lake Union Park on Valley Street, to advertise special events on the Premises, subject to the approval of the Superintendent.

 1.10 Covenant and Warranty of Quiet Possession. City covenants and warrants that MOHAI's peaceable and quiet occupation, use and enjoyment of the Premises shall not be disturbed by City or anyone claiming by or through City. City shall defend at its expense any third party claims asserted that would interfere with MOHAI's (and its permitted successors and assigns) right to such occupancy, use, and enjoyment of the Premises or City's title to the Premises.

 MOHAI will cooperate with the other maritime heritage participants in the Maritime Heritage Group and will participate in the Maritime Heritage Group. MOHAI will enter into collaborative agreements from time to time as desirable and appropriate with the Center for Wooden Boats, Northwest Seaport and the Virginia V Foundation (and with similar organizations in the event the foregoing named entities' presence at South Lake Union ends) relating to, among other things, marketing, programming and reasonable shared use of appropriate Museum facilities for public accommodations (such as ticketing, merchandizing and way-finding facilities).

All Rebuilding shall be done in consultation with City and the plans therefor shall be subject to City's reasonable approval. Nothing herein shall require MOHAI to repair and restore damage to Museum Property.

 If MOHAI will be restoring the Armory Building, then MOHAI shall apply for any permits or approvals required in connection with such Rebuilding diligently after the applicable insurance claims have been adjusted and proceeds thereof made available to MOHAI and other funding, if necessary, has been arranged, and after City has approved of the plans for Rebuilding.

 CONDEMNATION

 10.1 Taking. "Taking" means a taking by condemnation or by the exercise of the power of eminent domain by a public or quasi-public authority or entity, whether or not there is a taking of title, or a conveyance in lieu thereof. If there is a taking of the entire Premises and the Armory Building, then this Lease shall terminate as of the earlier of the date title to the Premises is transferred or the date MOHAI is dispossessed by the Taking authority.

 City further agrees that in any Taking by City pursuant to its power of eminent domain that results in the termination of this Lease, the measure of the damages to MOHAI for the value of the Armory Building shall be the cost to replace such facility, meaning funds sufficient to pay for a substitute facility of at least equal size, function, and capacity.

 10.2 Termination for Material Interference. If there is a Taking of part of the Premises or Armory Building that in MOHAI's reasonable judgment materially interferes with MOHAI's ability to use the Premises for the purposes set forth herein, which interference cannot be feasibly, economically, operationally or legally remediated, then MOHAI shall have the right to terminate this Lease by giving City notice of its election within sixty (60) days after the Taking. If this Lease is so terminated, then it shall terminate on the earlier of the date when title is transferred, the date MOHAI is dispossessed by the Taking authority or thirty (30) days following MOHAI's notice; provided that such termination shall in no event extinguish or diminish MOHAI's right under Section 10.3 to receive a portion of the award payable on account of the Taking.

 If the Taking does not materially interfere with MOHAI's ability to operate the Premises for the purposes set forth in this Lease, then this Lease shall continue in full force and effect as to the part not taken, except that MOHAI need not operate a Museum or provide the Public Benefits in the space so taken.

 10.3 Taking Award. The parties are entitled to the following portions of any award or settlement in lieu thereof payable on account of a Taking:

 (a) City shall be entitled to all amounts attributable to the value of the land comprising the Premises; and

 (b) MOHAI shall be entitled to receive:

 (i) All amounts attributable to the value of the Armory Building provided that such funds are used for a replacement facility for a regional history museum in Seattle. Such replacement facility shall be of comparable scale and quality to the Armory Building Museum. MOHAI shall provide public benefits at the replacement facility consistent with those enumerated in Exhibit E for not less than 40 years. In selecting the location for a replacement facility, MOHAI shall give priority consideration to a leasehold interest in any suitable City-owned site or facility that City may propose for such purpose. The term of the MOHAI lease in any such City-owned site or facility shall be long enough to justify the investment that will be necessary to replace the Museum and in no event less than the remaining term of this Lease when the Armory Building is taken;

 (ii) All amounts attributable Museum Property; and

 (iii) MOHAI's relocation expenses.

 If MOHAI has not started construction on a replacement facility for a regional history museum in Seattle within seven (7) years after the Taking and payment of the Taking proceeds to MOHAI (with such extensions as City may grant in its reasonable discretion), then the Taking proceeds described in Section 10.3(b)(i) above shall be contributed to City and MOHAI shall have no further claim to them. The provisions of this Section 10 shall survive expiration or termination of this Lease.

City understands that Museum operating requirements prohibit unaccompanied, unsupervised access (including inspection), except as specifically provided herein.

This waiver applies regardless of the cause or origin of the claim including without limitation loss due to the negligent acts or omissions of City or MOHAI, or their respective officers, directors, council members, employees, agents, contractors, invitees, MOHAI's assignees or subtenants. The parties shall have their property insurers endorse the applicable insurance policies to reflect the foregoing waiver of claims, provided however, that the endorsement shall not be required if the applicable policy of insurance permits the named insured to waive rights of subrogation on a blanket basis, in which case the blanket waiver shall be acceptable.

 12.6 Limitation of Tenant's Liability. In no event shall City, its successors or assigns, have any recourse whatsoever for any damages payable, obligations assumed or indemnifications proffered by MOHAI under this Lease to (a) the Museum Property, endowment, archives or other property of MOHAI; (b) funds and pledges of funds raised by MOHAI for the Project or operation of the Museum; (c) proceeds, rents or other income derived, arising from or attributable to the Armory Building or Museum, excluding insurance or condemnation proceeds; or (d) any claims for relief related to the Armory Building or the Project, including claims arising under the insurance policies required to be carried under this Lease or actually carried by MOHAI, except as provided in Section 9.1 above.

 ARTICLE 19

 MISCELLANEOUS

 19.1 No Partnership. Nothing contained in this Lease shall create any partnership, joint venture or other relationship between MOHAI and City. It is the intent of the parties that this Lease creates a leasehold estate in the Premises and that the relationship of the parties hereunder is that of landlord and tenant only.

 19.2 Successors. This Lease shall bind and inure to the benefit of City, its successors and assigns, MOHAI and its successors and assigns.

 19.3 Severability. If any provision of this Lease is determined to be invalid or unenforceable, then that provision and the remainder of this Lease shall continue in effect and be enforceable to the fullest extent permitted by law. It is the intention of the parties that if any provision of this Lease is capable of two constructions, one of which would render the provision void, and the other of which would render the provision valid, then the provision shall have the meaning that renders it valid.

 19.4 Integration and Amendments. Together with the Development Agreement, this Lease contains the entire integrated agreement between the parties as to the matters covered herein and supersedes any oral statements or representations or prior written matter not contained in this instrument as to the matters set forth herein. This Lease shall not be modified except by a written document signed by City and MOHAI (or their successors in title) upon passage of an ordinance by the City Council.

 19.5 Governing Law; Venue. This Lease shall be governed by and construed and enforced in accordance with the laws of the State of Washington.

 19.6 No Waiver. Failure of either party to complain of any act or omission on the part of the other, no matter how long the failure may continue, shall not constitute a waiver of any rights under this Lease. No waiver by any party of any breach of any provisions of this Lease shall be deemed a waiver of a breach of any other provision of this Lease or a consent to any subsequent breach of any other provision. If any action of any party requires the consent or approval of another, consent or approval given on one occasion shall not be deemed a consent to or approval of that action on any other occasion. No extension of time for performance of any obligation or act shall be deemed an extension of the time for performance of any other obligation or act.

 19.7 Construction. The following rules shall apply to the construction of this Lease unless the context otherwise requires:

 (a) Words describing the singular number shall include the plural number and vice versa, except where otherwise indicated.

 (b) All references herein to particular articles, sections or exhibits are references to articles, sections or exhibits of this Lease, unless otherwise expressly stated.

 (c) The headings and table of contents herein are solely for convenience of reference and shall not constitute a part of this Lease nor shall they affect its meaning, construction or effect.

 (d) This Lease shall not be construed as if it had been prepared by one of the parties, but rather as if all parties had prepared it.

 19.8 Time. Time is of the essence of every provision of this Lease.

 19.9 Cumulative Remedies. The rights and remedies that either party may have under this Lease or at law or in equity, upon any breach, are distinct, separate and cumulative and shall not be deemed inconsistent with each other, and no one of them shall be deemed to be exclusive of any other.

 19.10 Authority. Each party hereto warrants that it has the authority to enter into this Lease and to perform its obligations hereunder and that all necessary approvals, acts or resolutions to authorize this transaction have been taken, and the signatories, by executing this Lease, warrant that they have the authority to bind the respective parties.

 19.11 Consents and Approvals. In any instance when either party's consent or approval is required under this Lease, such consent or approval shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed. No permission, consent, or approval of City contained herein or given pursuant to this Lease is, or shall be construed as, a representation or assurance that the matter consented to or approved complies with applicable Laws, nor shall any such consent or approval be construed to authorize any failure to comply with such Laws. No action of the Superintendent in implementation of this Lease shall constitute or excuse any official action by any other City department or official that may be required by law, ordinance, rule or regulation.

 19.12 Counterparts. This Lease may be executed in counterparts for the convenience of the parties, and such counterparts shall together constitute one Lease.

 19.13 Force Majeure. Except as otherwise expressly provided in this Lease, time periods for any party's performance under any provisions of this Lease shall be suspended for periods of time during which such performance is prevented due to circumstances beyond such party's reasonable control, including without limitations, strikes, embargoes, shortages of labor or materials, governmental regulations, acts of God, unforeseen site conditions, casualty, war or other strife.

 19.14 Exhibits. Exhibits A through E attached hereto are hereby incorporated herein and made a part of this Lease, and the term "Lease" shall include all exhibits hereto.

 19.15 Limitation on Third Party Rights. Nothing in this Lease expressed or implied is intended or shall be construed to give to any person other than City or MOHAI any legal or equitable right, remedy or claim under or in respect of this Lease or any covenant, condition or provision herein contained; and all such covenants, conditions and provisions are and shall be held to be for the sole and exclusive benefit of City and MOHAI.

 19.16 Rights Reserved by City. City reserves the right to do the following, without liability of any kind, so long as such actions do not substantially interfere with MOHAI's rights under this Lease or its ability to operate the Museum and provide the Public Benefits:

 19.16.1 Appearance, Size and Location of Lake Union Park. Increase, reduce, and change in any manner whatsoever the number, appearance, dimension, and locations of Lake Union Park walks, buildings, landscaping, parking, and service areas, and make improvements, alterations, and additions to the portions of the Premises that are located outside of the Armory Building footprint.

 19.16.3 Admission Charges. Impose a reasonable charge for use of facilities (other than the Museum) within Lake Union Park, including parking facilities.

Promulgate, from time to time, reasonable rules and regulations regarding the use and occupancy of any area of Lake Union Park; provided that no such rule or regulation that would directly or indirectly affect any right granted to MOHAI by this Lease shall be promulgated without City having given prior written notice of such action to MOHAI and at least thirty (30) days to comment on such proposed action unless such promulgation is because of a declared emergency.

 19.16.5 Days and Hours for Operations. Determine the hours Lake Union Park will be open to the public. Nevertheless, regardless of park hours, City cannot restrict or block access to the Premises and Armory Building (recognizing that the Museum may be operating on different hours than when the park is open).

 MOHAI Public Benefits

 The Museum of History and Industry is committed to preserving and sharing the rich and diverse history of Seattle and its region with residents of and visitors to the city as well as to presenting exhibits and programs from institutions around the country that illuminate our shared national heritage. In partial consideration for the public support for the development of its new regional history museum at the Armory Building in Seattle's Lake Union Park and in fulfillment of its mission and ongoing commitment to the community, Ground Tenant and MOHAI (which for purposes of this Exhibit shall include any successor operator of the Museum) agrees that from and after the Opening Date of the Museum through the Term of the Lease, it will:

 1. Regional History Museum. Cause the Armory Building to be operated as an integrated, publicly accessible regional history museum with exhibits and programs devoted primarily to the history, culture, industry, commerce and maritime heritage of the Puget Sound region and the Pacific Northwest, including related space for meeting and educational functions, book store/gift shop and cafe.

 2. Opening Hours and General Admissions. Operate the Museum in the Armory Building at least fifty (50) hours per week, fifty (50) weeks per year, subject to the following admissions policy:

 (a) General public admission will be subject to reasonable standard admission charges;

 (b) Every day the Museum is open, any member of the public unable to pay the standard admission fee will be admitted (excluding special events) upon payment of whatever amount he or she determines he or she can pay. MOHAI will include this policy in its written admissions policies, including indication of this policy on its website;

 (c) At least one (1) day per calendar month will be regularly scheduled when admission to the Museum (excluding special events) is free of charge to all visitors; and

 (d) Children of elementary and middle school age (fourteen (14) years or younger) will be admitted free of charge every day the Museum is open. This excludes school and group admissions and special events.

 3. School Programs. Develop and offer on-going educational programs for elementary, middle and high school classrooms and provide reduced fee and other scholarship assistance to students from schools that participate in federal free or reduced price school lunch programs. In the event regional or other programs provide scholarship or transportation benefits to students from schools, MOHAI will participate in such programs.

 4. Cultural Diversity in Programming. Develop and implement programs and enrichment opportunities of interest to particular segments of the public by ensuring a robust slate of culturally diverse programming throughout the year, consistent with its traditional role in sharing and presenting the history of African Americans, Asian and Pacific Islander Americans, Hispanic Americans, Native Americans and others. To this end, MOHAI's programs and exhibits will incorporate the perspectives and stories of the entire Seattle community.

 5. City Use. Make the Museum available for up to four public events each year, identified by City and scheduled to the mutual convenience of the parties. Such events cannot unreasonably interfere with the operation of the Museum. The group sponsoring such events must be either City or an organized nonprofit corporation and such event sponsor must execute a use agreement required by MOHAI including appropriate indemnities and agreement to pay for costs as hereafter described. There shall be no facility rental fee for such events, but MOHAI shall be compensated for (and may required advance payment of) audio/visual, after hours or special security or staffing, catering and other event special needs and costs, if MOHAI elects to provide the same. MOHAI will also allow City to make occasional use of the Terrace for events in Lake Union Park, subject to the terms and conditions for the four events described in this paragraph.

 6. Meeting Space. Provide meeting room space for noncommercial use by South Lake Union community organizations for up to thirty (30) hours per month on a first-come, first-served basis, during hours when the Museum is open to the public, and subject to demand for such meeting space, MOHAI's rules regarding use of such space and MOHAI's scheduling convenience and execution of use agreements required by MOHAI (including appropriate indemnities and agreement to pay for costs as hereafter described). The parties recognize that separate, dedicated meeting space will not be included in the Project design and such meetings would need to occur in Museum areas that also serve other functions. There shall be no facility rental fee for such meetings, but MOHAI shall be compensated for (and may require advance payment of) audio/visual, special security or staffing, special set up and other event special needs and costs, if MOHAI elects to provide the same. MOHAI shall publicize the availability of such meeting space by, at a minimum, posting notice thereof in a prominent position on its website.

 7. Public Restrooms. Make available for public use restrooms in the cafe to be located in the Armory Building during Operating Hours without requiring payment of Museum admission charges.

 8. City Staff Work Space. Make available work space for regular use by City staff during Operating Hours or when Museum staff is on Premises in connection with the operation and maintenance of the Lake Union Park and the Maritime Heritage Group.

 9. Publicly Accessible Cafe. Design and cause the cafe to be operated so as to serve not only the Museum but Lake Union Park users generally. The cafe's open hours (if less than normal Museum open hours, exclusive of special events) and access policies (if any) shall be subject to the review and approval of the Superintendent, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld.

 10. Emergency Use. MOHAI acknowledges that Lake Union Park and the Armory Building have been designated as "Tier 2 Sheltering Sites" in City's Emergency Response Plan and that use of the Armory Building for Museum purposes may be impacted in the event of a declared emergency. City and MOHAI shall develop a protocol concerning any such use, providing for management of the Premises during a declared emergency and City responsibility for any cost, damage or liability associated with such use.
