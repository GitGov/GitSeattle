After extensive evaluation of alternatives by public transportation agencies, consultants, stakeholders, and citizens, the City finds that the Bored Tunnel Alternative balances Seattle's land use, economic, transportation, and environmental goals, including access to and through downtown for all modes of travel, consistent with Seattle's vision for reconnecting the downtown with the central waterfront to increase opportunities for public access to and enjoyment of the shoreline and waterfront.

 Section 2. The Mayor of Seattle or his designee is hereby authorized to execute, for and on behalf of the City, the Memorandum of Agreement entitled "MEMORANDUM OF AGREEMENT for the ALASKAN WAY VIADUCT AND SEAWALL REPLACEMENT PROGRAM BORED TUNNEL ALTERNATIVE" (GCA No. 6366) between the State of Washington and the City, substantially in the form attached hereto as Attachment 1. The attached agreement outlines the responsibilities of both the City and the State and expectations about the role of each in the implementation and funding of the numerous AWVSR Program elements.
