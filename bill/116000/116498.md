 Section 4. The following sections of Article 90 of the National Electrical Code, 2008 Edition, are amended as follows:

 ARTICLE 90

 Introduction

 90.1 ~~Purpose.~~Reserved.

~~(A) Practical Safeguarding. The purpose of this Code is the practical safeguarding of persons and property from hazards arising from the use of electricity.~~

~~(B) Adequacy. This Code contains provisions that are considered necessary for safety. Compliance therewith and proper maintenance results in an installation that is essentially free from hazard but not necessarily efficient, convenient, or adequate for good service or future expansion of electrical use.~~FPN: Hazards often occur because of overloading of wiring systems by methods or usage not in conformity with this Code. This occurs because initial wiring did not provide for increases in the use of electricity. An initial adequate installation and reasonable provisions for system changes provide for future increases in the use of electricity.

 (C) Intention. This Code is not intended as a design specification or an instruction manual for untrained persons.

 (D) Relation to Other International Standards. The requirements in this Code address the fundamental principles of protection for safety contained in Section 131 of International Electrotechnical Commission Standard 60364-1, Electrical Installations of Buildings.

 FPN: IEC 60364-1, Section 131, contains fundamental principles of protection for safety that encompass protection against electric shock, protection against thermal effects, protection against overcurrent, protection against fault currents, and protection against overvoltage. All of these potential hazards are addressed by the requirements in this Code.

 90.2 ~~Scope.~~Reserved.

 (3) Installations of conductors and equipment that connect to the supply of electricity

 (4) Installations used by the electric utility, such as office buildings, warehouses, garages, machine shops, and recreational buildings, that are not an integral part of a generating plant, substation, or control center.

 (B) Not Covered. This Code does not cover the following:

 (1) Installations in ships, watercraft other than floating buildings, railway rolling stock, aircraft, or automotive vehicles other than mobile homes and recreational vehicles

 FPN: Although the scope of this Code indicates that the Code does not cover installations in ships, portions of this Code are incorporated by reference into Title 46, Code of Federal Regulations, Parts 110- 113.

 (2) Installations underground in mines and self-propelled mobile surface mining machinery and its attendant electrical trailing cable

 (3) Installations of railways for generation, transformation, transmission, or distribution of power used exclusively for operation of rolling stock or installations used exclusively for signaling and communications purposes

 (4) Installations of communications equipment under the exclusive control of communications utilities located outdoors or in building spaces used exclusively for such installations

 (5) Installations under the exclusive control of an electric utility where such installations

 a. Consist of service drops or service laterals, and associated metering, or

 b. Are located in legally established easements or rights-of-way designated by or recognized by public service commissions, utility commissions, or other regulatory agencies having jurisdiction for such installations, or

 c. Are on property owned or leased by the electric utility for the purpose of communications, metering, generation, control, transformation, transmission, or distribution of electric energy.

 FPN to (4) and (5): Examples of utilities may include those entities that are typically designated or recognized by governmental law or regulation by public service/utility commissions and that install, operate, and maintain electric supply (such as generation, transmission, or distribution systems) or communication systems (such as telephone, CATV, Internet, satellite, or data services). Utilities may be subject to compliance with codes and standards covering their regulated activities as adopted under governmental law or regulation. Additional information can be found through consultation with the appropriate governmental bodies, such as state regulatory commissions, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, and the Federal Communications Commission.

~~(C) Special Permission. The authority having jurisdiction for enforcing this Code may grant exception for the installation of conductors and equipment that are not under the exclusive control of the electric utilities and are used to connect the electric utility supply system to the service-entrance conductors of the premises served, provided such installations are outside a building or terminate immediately inside a building wall.~~

Ground-fault protection of equipment shall be provided for solidly grounded wye electric services of more than 150 volts to ground but not exceeding 600 volts phase-to-phase for each service disconnect rated 1000 amperes or more. The grounded conductor for the solidly grounded wye system shall be connected directly to ground through a grounding electrode system, as specified in 250.50, without inserting any resistor or impedance device.

 The rating of the service disconnect shall be considered to be the rating of the largest fuse that can be installed or the highest continuous current trip setting for which the actual overcurrent device installed in a circuit breaker is rated or can be adjusted.

 Exception: The ground-fault protection provisions of this section shall not apply to a service disconnect for a continuous industrial process where a nonorderly shutdown will introduce additional or increased hazards.

 (A) Setting. The ground-fault protection system shall operate to cause the service disconnect to open all ungrounded conductors of the faulted circuit. The maximum setting of the ground-fault protection shall be 1200 amperes, and the maximum time delay shall be one second for ground-fault currents equal to or greater than 3000 amperes.

 (B) Fuses. If a switch and fuse combination is used, the fuses employed shall be capable of interrupting any current higher than the interrupting capacity of the switch during a time that the ground- fault protective system will not cause the switch to open.

 (C) Performance Testing. The ground-fault protection system shall be performance tested when first installed on site. ~~The test shall be conducted in accordance with instructions that shall be provided with the equipment. A written record of this test shall be made and shall be available to the authority having jurisdiction.~~

The testing shall verify that the system is installed and operates in accordance with the manufacturer's instructions. Testing shall be performed by qualified personnel having proper equipment to complete the acceptance testing in the manner prescribed by the manufacturer. The testing personnel shall sign a written performance acceptance test record. The record shall provide testing details  including, but not limited to, measurements and trip settings used during the test.

 The written acceptance test record, together with a copy of the manufacturer's performance testing instructions, shall be made available to the inspector for the authority having jurisdiction.

 (D) Added ground-fault protection system.

Ground fault protection systems added to an existing energized service shall be tested and inspected prior to being placed into service

 FPN No. 1: Ground-fault protection that functions to open the service disconnect affords no protection from faults on the line side of the protective element. It serves only to limit damage to

 conductors and equipment on the load side in the event of an arcing

 ground fault on the load side of the protective element.

 FPN No. 2: This added protective equipment at the service equipment may make it necessary to review the overall wiring system for proper selective overcurrent protection coordination. Additional installations of ground-fault protective equipment may be needed on feeders and branch circuits where maximum continuity of electric service is necessary.

 FPN No. 3: Where ground-fault protection is provided for the service disconnect and interconnection is made with another supply system by a transfer device, means or devices may be needed to ensure proper ground-fault sensing by the ground-fault protection equipment.

 FPN No. 4: See 517.17(A) for information on where an additional step of ground-fault protection is required for hospitals and other buildings with critical areas or life support equipment.
