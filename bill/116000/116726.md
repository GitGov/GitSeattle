 AN ORDINANCE relating to economic and community development; authorizing The City of Seattle's Office of Economic Development to execute an agreement with the United States Department of the Treasury regarding an allocation of federal New Markets Tax Credits to Seattle Investment Fund LLC; authorizing related agreements; and ratifying and confirming certain prior acts.

 WHEREAS, the federal government established the New Markets Tax Credit ("NMTC") program in December 2000 to spur the investment of private sector capital in low income areas by permitting taxpayers to receive a credit against federal income taxes for making equity investments in entities known as Community Development Entities ("CDEs"); and

 WHEREAS, State law, RCW 35.21.735, authorizes The City of Seattle (the "City") to create partnerships and limited liability companies and enter into agreements with public or private entities, including partnership agreements and limited liability company agreements, to implement within its boundaries the NMTC program; and

 WHEREAS, pursuant to such authority, the City's Office of Economic Development created Seattle Investment Fund LLC ("Primary Allocatee") as a Washington limited liability company comprised of the City as its sole and managing member, and caused the Primary Allocatee to be recognized by the United States Department of the Treasury ("Treasury") as a qualified CDE for purposes of the NMTC program; and

 WHEREAS, the City's Office of Economic Development also created Seattle Subsidiary Investment Fund I LLC, Seattle Subsidiary Investment Fund II LLC, Seattle Subsidiary Investment Fund III LLC and Seattle Subsidiary Investment Fund IV LLC (each, a "Subsidiary Allocatee") as Washington limited liability companies comprised of the Primary Allocatee as their sole and managing member, and caused each Subsidiary Allocatee to be recognized by the Treasury as a qualified CDE for purposes of the NMTC program; and

 WHEREAS, Seattle Investment Fund LLC submitted an application to the Treasury for an allocation of NMTCs to create flexible financing which will support catalytic projects in low-income communities that leverage other public investments, fill financing gaps caused by the contraction of credit in the real estate and business financing markets, and promote the development of small businesses in low-income communities; and

 WHEREAS, Treasury awarded the Primary Allocatee an allocation of $40,000,000 in NMTC eligible investments; and

 WHEREAS, Treasury conditioned the award on the Primary Allocatee's execution of an Allocation Agreement; NOW THEREFORE

The Director of the Office of Economic Development (the "Director") is authorized, for and on behalf of the City, as the Primary Allocatee's managing member, to execute an Allocation Agreement with the Treasury's Community Development Financial Institutions Fund ("CDFI Fund") for an allocation of $40,000,000 in NMTC eligible investments to the Primary Allocatee. The final agreement shall be based upon the proposed agreement attached to this Ordinance as Attachment A, with all understandings and assurances contained therein, and with such additions, modifications and amendments as Treasury may require or the Director may deem necessary or advisable in order to carry out the intent of this Ordinance and obtain the necessary approval from Treasury. The Director is designated as the official representative of the City to act in connection with the agreement and is authorized to provide additional information or enter into other related agreements as may be required to obtain the necessary approval from the Treasury and/or the CDFI Fund.
