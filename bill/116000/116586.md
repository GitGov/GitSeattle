 CITY OF SEATTLE ) ) REQUEST FOR INFORMATION AND ) COMPLIANCE ORDER BY CONSENT ) Respondent. )

 STATUTORY AUTHORITY

 1. The following FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS are made and ORDER issued pursuant to the authority vested in the Administrator of the United States Environmental Protection Agency ("EPA") by Sections 308 and 309(a) of the Clean Water Act ("Act"), 33 U.S.C. sections 1318 and 1319(a). This authority has been delegated to the Regional Administrator for EPA Region 10 and has been redelegated to the Director of the Office of Compliance and Enforcement.

 FINDINGS

 2. Section 301(a) of the Act, 33 U.S.C. section 1311(a), prohibits the discharge of any pollutant into the waters of the United States by any person except in accordance with other specified sections of the Act, including Section 402, 33 U.S.C. section 1342.

 3. Section 402(a) of the Act, 33 U.S.C. section 1342(a), provides that the Administrator of EPA may issue permits under the National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System ("NPDES") program for the discharge of any pollutant into the waters of the United States upon such specific terms and conditions as the Administrator may prescribe.

 4. Pursuant to Section 402(b) of the Act, 33 U.S.C. section 1342(b), of the Act, a State may administer its own NPDES permit program for discharges into navigable waters within its jurisdiction upon approval by the Administrator of EPA. EPA has approved the State of Washington's NPDES permit program. Therefore, within the State of Washington, the Washington Department of Ecology ("WADOE") issues NPDES permits to point sources pursuant to the Act.

 5. Although WADOE issues NPDES permits in the State of Washington, EPA retains the authority to take an enforcement action pursuant to Section 309 of the Act, 33 U.S.C. section 1319. See 33 U.S.C. section 1342(i).

 6. Section 309(a) of the Act, 33 U.S.C. section 1319(a), provides that the Administrator may issue a compliance order when the Administrator finds that a person is in violation of any permit condition that implements various sections of the Act.

 7. The City of Seattle ("Respondent") owns and operates a combined sewer, partially separate sewer, and separate sanitary sewer collection system ("Facility"). The City of Seattle Public Utilities Division is the division of the Respondent responsible for operation and maintenance of the Facility. The Facility is operated remotely at 700 Fifth Avenue in Seattle, Washington. Respondent is a municipality organized under the laws of the State of Washington and, thus, is a "person" within the meaning of Section 502(5) of the Act, 33 U.S.C. section1362(5).

 8. NPDES Permit No. WA-003168-2 ("Permit") was issued to Respondent and became effective on November 30, 2005. The Permit expires on November 30, 2010. The Permit specifies the conditions under which Respondent is authorized to discharge combined sewer overflows ("CSOs") from 92 permitted CSO outfalls.

 9. The CSO outfalls that are authorized under the Permit are Outfalls 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 18, 19, 20, 22, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41, 42, 43, 44, 45, 46, 47, 48, 49, 56, 57, 59, 60, 61, 62, 63, 64, 68, 69, 70, 71, 72, 78, 80, 83, 85, 88, 90, 91, 94, 95, 99, 107, 111, 116, 120, 121, 124, 127, 129, 130, 131, 132, 134, 135, 136, 138, 139, 140, 141, 144, 145, 146, 147, 148, 150, 151, 152, 161, 165, 168, 169, 170, 171, 174, and 175 ("Outfalls").

 10. The Outfalls are "point sources" within the meaning of 40 C.F.R. section 122.2.

 11. The Outfalls discharge to Lake Washington, Union Bay, Puget Sound, Salmon Bay, Elliott Bay, Duwamish River, Lake Union, Portage Bay, and Salmon Bay Waterway. Lake Washington, Union Bay, Puget Sound, Salmon Bay, Elliott Bay, Duwamish River, Lake Union, Portage Bay, and Salmon Bay Waterway are "navigable waters" within the meaning of Section 502(7) of the Act, 33 U.S.C. section 1362(7), and are "waters of the United States" within the meaning of 40 C.F.R. section 122.2.

 12. From March 17 through March 21, 2007, EPA conducted a NPDES compliance inspection of the Facility ("March 2007 Inspection").

 13. Pursuant to Section S7.5 of the Permit, Respondent is prohibited from discharging from the Outfalls during dry weather. Therefore, any discharges from the CSO outfalls during periods of dry weather are violations of Section S7.5 of the Permit.

 14. Between December 2004 to November 2007, there were twenty (20) dry weather overflows from Respondent's CSO outfalls. See Attachment A. These dry weather overflows constitute violations of Section S7.5 of the Permit.

 15. During the March 2007 Inspection, EPA also observed a direct sanitary sewer connection discharging intermittently through CSO Outfall 132 into Lake Union. This discharge was in violation of Section S7.5 of the Permit.

 16. Pursuant to Section S4.C of the Permit, Respondent is "responsible for maintaining safeguards to prevent the discharge of untreated wastes or wastes not treated ... during electrical power failure at the sewage lift stations either by means of alternative power sources, standby generator, retention of inadequately treated wastes, by-pass pumping, or other equally protective measures."

 17. On July 22, 2006, November 21, 2006, and November 12, 2007, Respondent had dry weather overflows from pump stations due to power failure. The dry weather outfalls were discharged from Outfalls 127, 64, and 88 respectively. EPA has determined that because there were dry weather overflows as a result of power outages, Respondent failed to maintain adequate safeguards to prevent the discharge of untreated wastes in violation of Section S4.C of the Permit.

 18. Pursuant to Section S7.1.b of the Permit, Respondent must "inspect and maintain all CSO structures, regulators, pumping stations, and tide gates to minimize CSOs and prevent tidal inflow."

 19. During the March 2007 Inspection, EPA observed that the tide gates for Outfalls 069, 070, 071, 072, and 111 were allowing tidal inflow to flow into the collection system in violation of Section S7.1.b of the Permit.

 20. Pursuant to Section S7.6 of the Permit, Respondent must "implement measures to control solid and floatable materials in the CSOs."

 21. At the time of the March 2007 Inspection, Respondent had not implemented measures to control solids and floatable material in violation of Section S7.6 of the Permit.

 REQUEST FOR INFORMATION AND COMPLIANCE ORDER

 22. Respondent neither admits nor denies the findings of fact and/or conclusions of law set forth in Paragraphs 12 through 21. Respondents, however, consents to the issuance of this Order and agrees to perform the actions set forth in the paragraphs below.
