 AN ORDINANCE relating to residential rental property registration and inspections, superceding Section 3 of Council Bill No. 116857, declaring an emergency; and ratifying and confirming prior acts, all by a three- fourths vote of the City Council.

 WHEREAS, the City Council has determined substandard and unsanitary residential buildings and dwelling units exist within the City of Seattle; and

 WHEREAS, improving residential housing and providing for neighborhood stability throughout the City through improved housing conditions requires periodic inspection of residential rental housing units in the City to determine if such premises fail to comply with certain requirements of the City's Housing Code or endanger or impair the health or safety of a tenant; and

 WHEREAS, in order to provide for such periodic inspection of residential rental housing units, a Residential Rental Business License and Inspection Program must be established, and Council passed CB 116857 on June 1, 2010 to provide such a program; NOW, THEREFORE,

 BE IT ORDAINED BY THE CITY OF SEATTLE AS FOLLOWS:

 Section 1. The 2010 State legislature passed SSB 6459, providing for inspections of rental housing and providing limitations on local rental housing inspection programs. Section 2(11) of SSB 6459 provided that local inspection programs adopted by municipalities prior to the effective date of SSB 6459 would not be subject to the limitations on local programs contained in SSB 6459. The effective date of SSB 6459 is June 10, 2010.

 By its passage of C.B. 116857 on June 1, 2010, the City Council determined that improving residential housing and providing for neighborhood stability through improved housing conditions and through adoption of a periodic inspection program for residential rental housing units tailored to the needs of the City of Seattle is necessary to address the substandard and unsanitary residential buildings and dwelling units in the City that threaten the peace, health, and safety of City residents. C.B. 116857 provided for an effective date of 30 days after the Mayor's signature, or if not approved and returned by the Mayor within ten days after presentation, in accordance Municipal Code Section 1.04.020. In order to assure that the ordinance meets the standards for a prior-adopted local program contained in SSB 6459 so that the City Council can provide a rental housing inspection program that meets the unique needs of the City of Seattle and protect the peace, health and safety of its residents, it is necessary that CB 116857 take effect immediately.

 Because of the foregoing facts, an emergency is declared to exist under Seattle City Charter Article 4, Subsection 1(I). It is necessary for the immediate preservation of the public peace, health and safety that C.B. 116857 and this ordinance take effect without delay. Section 3 of C.B. 116857 is superceded, and both this ordinance and C.B. 116857 therefore shall become effective immediately upon its passage by a three-fourths vote of the City Council, and its approval by the Mayor, as provided in the Charter.

 Section 2. By reason of the findings set out in Section 1, and the emergency that is hereby declared to exist, Section 3 of C.B. 116857 is superceded, and both this ordinance and C.B. 116857 shall become effective immediately upon its passage by a three-fourths vote of the City Council, and its approval by the Mayor, as provided by Article 4, Subsection 1(I) of the Charter of the City.

 Section 3. Any act consistent with the authority and prior to the effective date of this ordinance is hereby ratified and confirmed.

 Passed by a three-fourths vote of all the members of the City Council the ____ day of _________, 2010, and signed by me in open session in authentication of its passage this _____ day of __________, 2010.
