 AN ORDINANCE relating to the Office of Professional Accountability; amending Seattle Municipal Code Chapter 3.28 to require that the Chief of Police and the OPA Director provide written explanations when they disagree on the final disposition of a complaint investigation, and to require that the OPA Director provide a written explanation when his or her recommendation to sustain a misconduct complaint results in no discipline because the complaint investigation was not completed within the time period specified in the applicable union contract.

 WHEREAS, Resolution 30621 defined the main goals of civilian oversight of law enforcement to be accountability, public confidence and the promotion of the best professional conduct; and

 WHEREAS, Resolution 30621 defined public confidence to be confidence in the City's response to complaints of officer misconduct and confidence in the professionalism of Seattle police officers generally; and

 WHEREAS, the City Council believes public confidence in the City's response to complaints of officer misconduct will be increased if the Office of Professional Accountability Director and Chief of Police report in writing on instances in which the Director and the Chief disagree about the disposition of a misconduct investigation; and

 WHEREAS, the City Council also believes public confidence in the City's response to complaints of officer misconduct will be increased if the Office of Professional Accountability Director reports in writing on instances in which his or her recommendation to sustain a misconduct complaint results in no discipline because the complaint investigation was not completed within the time period specified in the applicable union contract; and

 WHEREAS, the City Council recognizes the right of the Seattle Police Management Association and the Seattle Police Officers' Guild to bargain over mandatory subjects of bargaining, and intends that the reporting requirements created by this ordinance shall not affect the discipline or the privacy interests of individual officers; and

 WHEREAS, the timelines for completing misconduct investigations are specified in section B.7 of the collective bargaining agreement by and between the City of Seattle and the Seattle Police Management Association and in sections 3.6(B-D) of the collective bargaining agreement by and between the City of Seattle and the Seattle Police Officers' Guild;

 B. If the OPA Director recommends that a misconduct complaint be sustained, but no discipline results because an investigation time limit specified in a collective bargaining agreement between the City and the subject employee's bargaining unit has been exceeded, within sixty (60) days of the final disposition of the complaint investigation the OPA Director shall make a written explanation of the nature of the allegations in the complaint and the reason or reasons the time limit was exceeded for inclusion in the OPA case file.

 C.
