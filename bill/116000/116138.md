 Article 4. Scope of Service

 4.1 Interconnection Product Options. Interconnection Customer has selected the following (checked) type of Interconnection Service:

 4.1.1 Energy Resource Interconnection Service.

 4.1.1.1 The Product. Energy Resource Interconnection Service allows Interconnection Customer to connect the Generating Facility to the Transmission System and be eligible to deliver the Generating Facility's output using the existing firm or non-firm capacity of the Transmission System on an "as available" basis. To the extent Interconnection Customer wants to receive Energy Resource Interconnection Service, Transmission Provider shall construct facilities identified in Attachment A.

 4.1.1.2 Transmission Delivery Service Implications. Under Energy Resource Interconnection Service, Interconnection Customer will be eligible to inject power from the Generating Facility into and deliver power across the interconnecting Transmission Provider's Transmission System on an "as available" basis up to the amount of MWs identified in the applicable stability and steady state studies to the extent the upgrades initially required to qualify for Energy Resource Interconnection Service have been constructed. Where eligible to do so (e.g., PJM, ISO-NE, NYISO), Interconnection Customer may place a bid to sell into the market up to the maximum identified Generating Facility output, subject to any conditions specified in the interconnection service approval, and the Generating Facility will be dispatched to the extent Interconnection Customer's bid clears. In all other instances, no transmission delivery service from the Generating Facility is assured, but Interconnection Customer may obtain Point-to-Point Transmission Service, Network Integration Transmission Service, or be used for secondary network transmission service, pursuant to Transmission Provider's Tariff, up to the maximum output identified in the stability and steady state studies. In those instances, in order for Interconnection Customer to obtain the right to deliver or inject energy beyond the Generating Facility Point of Interconnection or to improve its ability to do so, transmission delivery service must be obtained pursuant to the provisions of Transmission Provider's Tariff. The Interconnection Customer's ability to inject its Generating Facility output beyond the Point of Interconnection, therefore, will depend on the existing capacity of Transmission Provider's Transmission System at such time as a transmission service request is made that would accommodate such delivery. The provision of firm Point-to-Point Transmission Service or Network Integration Transmission Service may require the construction of additional Network Upgrades.

 4.1.2 Network Resource Interconnection Service.

 4.1.2.1 The Product. Transmission Provider must conduct the necessary studies and construct the Network Upgrades needed to integrate the Generating Facility (1) in a manner comparable to that in which Transmission Provider integrates its generating facilities to serve native load customers; or (2) in an ISO or RTO with market based congestion management, in the same manner as all Network Resources. To the extent Interconnection Customer wants to receive Network Resource Interconnection Service, Transmission Provider shall construct the facilities identified in Attachment A to this LGIA.

 4.1.2.2 Transmission Delivery Service Implications. Network Resource Interconnection Service allows the Large Generating Facility to be designated by any Network Customer under the Tariff on Transmission Provider's Transmission System as a Network Resource, up to the Large Generating Facility's full output, on the same basis as existing Network Resources interconnected to Transmission Provider's Transmission System, and to be studied as a Network Resource on the assumption that such a designation will occur. Although Network Resource Interconnection Service does not convey a reservation of transmission service, any Network Customer under the Tariff can utilize its network service under the Tariff to obtain delivery of energy from the interconnected Large Generating Facility in the same manner as it accesses Network Resources. A Large Generating Facility receiving Network Resource Interconnection Service may also be used to provide Ancillary Services after technical studies and/or periodic analyses are performed with respect to the Large Generating Facility's ability to provide any applicable Ancillary Services, provided that such studies and analyses have been or would be required in connection with the provision of such Ancillary Services by any existing Network Resource. However, if a Large Generating Facility has not been designated as a Network Resource by any load, it cannot be required to provide Ancillary Services except to the extent such requirements extend to all generating facilities that are similarly situated. The provision of Network Integration Transmission Service or firm Point-to-Point Transmission Service may require additional studies and the construction of additional upgrades. Because such studies and upgrades would be associated with a request for delivery service under the Tariff, cost responsibility for the studies and upgrades would be in accordance with FERC's policy for pricing transmission delivery services.

 Network Resource Interconnection Service does not necessarily provide Interconnection Customer with the capability to physically deliver the output of the interconnected Large Generating Facility to any particular load on Transmission Provider's Transmission System without incurring congestion costs. In the event of transmission constraints on Transmission Provider's Transmission System, the Large Generating Facility shall be subject to the applicable congestion management procedures in Transmission Provider's Transmission System in the same manner as Network Resources.

 There is no requirement either at the time of study or interconnection, or at any point in the future, that the Large Generating Facility be designated as a Network Resource by a Network Service Customer under the Tariff or that Interconnection Customer identify a specific buyer (or sink). To the extent a Network Customer does designate the Large Generating Facility as a Network Resource, it must do so pursuant to Transmission Provider's Tariff.

 Once an Interconnection Customer satisfies the requirements for obtaining Network Resource Interconnection Service, any future transmission service request for delivery from the Large Generating Facility within Transmission Provider's Transmission System of any amount of capacity and/or energy, up to the amount initially studied, will not require that any additional studies be performed or that any further upgrades associated with such Large Generating Facility be undertaken, regardless of whether or not such Large Generating Facility is ever designated by a Network Customer as a Network Resource and regardless of changes in ownership of the Large Generating Facility. However, the reduction or elimination of congestion or redispatch costs may require additional studies and the construction of additional upgrades.

 To the extent Interconnection Customer enters into an arrangement for long term transmission service for deliveries from the Large Generating Facility outside Transmission Provider's Transmission System, such request may require additional studies and upgrades in order for Transmission Provider to grant such request.

 4.2 Provision of Service. Transmission Provider shall provide Interconnection Service for the Generating Facility at the Point of Interconnection.

 4.3 Performance Standards. Each Party shall perform all of its obligations under this LGIA in accordance with Applicable Laws and Regulations, Applicable Reliability Standards, and Good Utility Practice, and to the extent a Party is required or prevented or limited in taking any action by such regulations and standards, such Party shall not be deemed to be in Breach of this LGIA for its compliance therewith. If such Party is a Transmission Provider or Transmission Owner, then that Party shall amend the LGIA and submit the amendment to FERC for approval.

 4.4 No Transmission Delivery Service. The execution of this LGIA does not constitute a request for, nor the provision of, any transmission delivery service under Transmission Provider's Tariff, and does not convey any right to deliver electricity to any specific customer or Point of Delivery.

 4.5 Interconnection Customer Provided Services. The services provided by Interconnection Customer under this LGIA are set forth in Article 9.6 and Article 13.5.1. Interconnection Customer shall be paid for such services in accordance with Article 11.6.

The actual damages to Interconnection Customer, in the event Transmission Provider's Interconnection Facilities or Network Upgrades are not completed by the dates designated by Interconnection Customer and accepted by Transmission Provider pursuant to subparagraphs 5.1.2 or 5.1.4, above, may include Interconnection Customer's fixed operation and maintenance costs and lost opportunity costs. Such actual damages are uncertain and impossible to determine at this time. Because of such uncertainty, any liquidated damages paid by Transmission Provider to Interconnection Customer in the event that Transmission Provider does not complete any portion of Transmission Provider's Interconnection Facilities or Network Upgrades by the applicable dates, shall be an amount equal to 1/2 of 1 percent per day of the actual cost of Transmission Provider's Interconnection Facilities and Network Upgrades, in the aggregate, for which Transmission Provider has assumed responsibility to design, procure and construct.

 However, in no event shall the total liquidated damages exceed 20 percent of the actual cost of Transmission Provider's Interconnection Facilities and Network Upgrades for which Transmission Provider has assumed responsibility to design, procure, and construct. The foregoing payments will be made by Transmission Provider to Interconnection Customer as just compensation for the damages caused to Interconnection Customer, which actual damages are uncertain and impossible to determine at this time, and as reasonable liquidated damages, but not as a penalty or a method to secure performance of this LGIA. Liquidated damages, when the Parties agree to them, are the exclusive remedy for the Transmission Provider's failure to meet its schedule.

 No liquidated damages shall be paid to Interconnection Customer if: (1) Interconnection Customer is not ready to commence use of Transmission Provider's Interconnection Facilities or Network Upgrades to take the delivery of power for the Large Generating Facility's Trial Operation or to export power from the Large Generating Facility on the specified dates, unless Interconnection Customer would have been able to commence use of Transmission Provider's Interconnection

 5.17 Taxes.

 5.17.1 Interconnection Customer Payments Not Taxable. The Parties intend that all payments or property transfers made by Interconnection Customer to Transmission Provider for the installation of Transmission Provider's Interconnection Facilities and the Network Upgrades shall be non-taxable, either as contributions to capital, or as an advance, in accordance with the Internal Revenue Code and any applicable state income tax laws and shall not be taxable as contributions in aid of construction or otherwise under the Internal Revenue Code and any applicable state income tax laws.

 5.17.2 Representations and Covenants. In accordance with IRS Notice 2001-82 and IRS Notice 88-129, Interconnection Customer represents and covenants that (i) {Deleted.],[EL1] (ii) for income tax purposes, the amount of any payments and the cost of any property transferred to Transmission Provider for Transmission Provider's Interconnection Facilities will be capitalized by Interconnection Customer as an intangible asset and recovered using the straight-line method over a useful life of twenty (20) years, and (iii) any portion of Transmission Provider's Interconnection Facilities that is a "dual-use intertie," within the meaning of IRS Notice 88-129, is reasonably expected to carry only a de minimis amount of electricity in the direction of the Large Generating Facility. For this purpose, "de minimis amount" means no more than 5 percent of the total power flows in both directions, calculated in accordance with the "5 percent test" set forth in IRS Notice 88-129. This is not intended to be an exclusive list of the relevant conditions that must be met to conform to IRS requirements for non-taxable treatment.

 At Transmission Provider's request, Interconnection Customer shall provide Transmission Provider with a report from an independent engineer confirming its representation in clause (iii), above. Transmission Provider represents and covenants that the cost of Transmission Provider's Interconnection Facilities paid for by Interconnection Customer will have no net effect on the base upon which rates are determined.

 5.17.3 Indemnification for the Cost Consequences of Current Tax Liability Imposed Upon the Transmission Provider. Notwithstanding Article 5.17.1, Interconnection Customer shall protect, indemnify and hold harmless Transmission Provider from the cost consequences of any current tax liability imposed against Transmission Provider as the result of payments or property transfers made by Interconnection Customer to Transmission Provider under this LGIA for Interconnection Facilities, as well as any interest and penalties, other than interest and penalties attributable to any delay caused by Transmission Provider.

 Transmission Provider shall not include a gross-up for the cost consequences of any current tax liability in the amounts it charges Interconnection Customer under this LGIA unless (i) Transmission Provider has determined, in good faith, that the payments or property transfers made by Interconnection Customer to Transmission Provider should be reported as income subject to taxation or (ii) any Governmental Authority directs Transmission Provider to report payments or property as income subject to taxation; provided, however, that Transmission Provider may require Interconnection Customer to provide security for Interconnection Facilities, in a form reasonably acceptable to Transmission Provider (such as a parental guarantee or a letter of credit), in an amount equal to the cost consequences of any current tax liability under this Article 5.17. Interconnection Customer shall reimburse Transmission Provider for such costs on a fully grossed-up basis, in accordance with Article 5.17.4, within thirty (30) Calendar Days of receiving written notification from Transmission Provider of the amount due, including detail about how the amount was calculated.

 The indemnification obligation shall terminate at the earlier of (1) the expiration of the ten year testing period and the applicable statute of limitation, as it may be extended by Transmission Provider upon request of the IRS, to keep these years open for audit or adjustment, or (2) the occurrence of a subsequent taxable event and the payment of any related indemnification obligations as contemplated by this Article 5.17.

 5.17.4 Tax Gross-Up Amount. Interconnection Customer's liability for the cost consequences of any current tax liability under this Article 5.17 shall be calculated on a fully grossed-up basis. Except as may otherwise be agreed to by the parties, this means that Interconnection Customer will pay Transmission Provider, in addition to the amount paid for the Interconnection Facilities and Network Upgrades, an amount equal to (1) the current taxes imposed on Transmission Provider ("Current Taxes") on the excess of (a) the gross income realized by Transmission Provider as a result of payments or property transfers made by Interconnection Customer to Transmission Provider under this LGIA (without regard to any payments under this Article 5.17) (the "Gross Income Amount") over (b) the present value of future tax deductions for depreciation that will be available as a result of such payments or property transfers (the "Present Value Depreciation Amount"), plus (2) an additional amount sufficient to permit Transmission Provider to receive and retain, after the payment of all Current Taxes, an amount equal to the net amount described in clause (1).

 For this purpose, (i) Current Taxes shall be computed based on Transmission Provider's composite federal and state tax rates at the time the payments or property transfers are received and Transmission Provider will be treated as being subject to tax at the highest marginal rates in effect at that time (the "Current Tax Rate"), and (ii) the Present Value Depreciation Amount shall be computed by discounting Transmission Provider's anticipated tax depreciation deductions as a result of such payments or property transfers by Transmission Provider's current weighted average cost of capital.

 Thus, the formula for calculating Interconnection Customer's liability to Transmission Owner pursuant to this Article 5.17.4 can be expressed as follows: (Current Tax Rate x (Gross Income Amount - Present Value of Tax Depreciation/(1-Current Tax Rate). Interconnection Customer's estimated tax liability in the event taxes are imposed shall be stated in Appendix A, Interconnection Facilities, Network Upgrades and Distribution Upgrades.

 5.17.5 Private Letter Ruling or Change or Clarification of Law. At Interconnection Customer's request and expense, Transmission Provider shall file with the IRS a request for a private letter ruling as to whether any property transferred or sums paid, or to be paid, by Interconnection Customer to Transmission Provider under this LGIA are subject to federal income taxation. Interconnection Customer will prepare the initial draft of the request for a private letter ruling, and will certify under penalties of perjury that all facts represented in such request are true and accurate to the best of Interconnection Customer's knowledge. Transmission Provider and Interconnection Customer shall cooperate in good faith with respect to the submission of such request.

 Transmission Provider shall keep Interconnection Customer fully informed of the status of such request for a private letter ruling and shall execute either a privacy act waiver or a limited power of attorney, in a form acceptable to the IRS, that authorizes Interconnection Customer to participate in all discussions with the IRS regarding such request for a private letter ruling. Transmission Provider shall allow Interconnection Customer to attend all meetings

 with IRS officials about the request and shall permit Interconnection Customer to prepare the initial drafts of any follow-up letters in connection with the request.

 5.17.6 Subsequent Taxable Events. If, within 10 years from the date on which the relevant Transmission Provider's Interconnection Facilities are placed in service, (i) Interconnection Customer Breaches the covenants contained in Article 5.17.2, (ii) a "disqualification event" occurs within the meaning of IRS Notice 88- 129, or (iii) this LGIA terminates and Transmission Provider retains ownership of the Interconnection Facilities and Network Upgrades, Interconnection Customer shall pay a tax gross-up for the cost consequences of any current tax liability imposed on Transmission Provider, calculated using the methodology described in Article 5.17.4 and in accordance with IRS Notice 90-60.

 5.17.7 Contests. In the event any Governmental Authority determines that Transmission Provider's receipt of payments or property constitutes income that is subject to taxation, Transmission Provider shall notify Interconnection Customer, in writing, within thirty (30) Calendar Days of receiving notification of such determination by a Governmental Authority. Upon the timely written request by Interconnection Customer and at Interconnection Customer's sole expense, Transmission Provider may appeal, protest, seek abatement of, or otherwise oppose such determination. Upon Interconnection Customer's written request and sole expense, Transmission Provider may file a claim for refund with respect to any taxes paid under this Article 5.17, whether or not it has received such a determination. Transmission Provider reserves the right to make all decisions with regard to the prosecution of such appeal, protest, abatement or other contest, including the selection of counsel and compromise or settlement of the claim, but Transmission Provider shall keep Interconnection Customer informed, shall consider

 in good faith suggestions from Interconnection Customer about the conduct of the contest, and shall reasonably permit Interconnection Customer or an Interconnection Customer representative to attend contest proceedings.

 Interconnection Customer shall pay to Transmission Provider on a periodic basis, as invoiced by Transmission Provider, Transmission Provider's documented reasonable costs of prosecuting such appeal, protest, abatement or other contest. At any time during the contest, Transmission Provider may agree to a settlement either with Interconnection Customer's consent or after obtaining written advice from nationally-recognized tax counsel, selected by Transmission Provider, but reasonably acceptable to Interconnection Customer, that the proposed settlement represents a reasonable settlement given the hazards of litigation. Interconnection Customer's obligation shall be based on the amount of the settlement agreed to by Interconnection Customer, or if a higher amount, so much of the settlement that is supported by the written advice from nationally-recognized tax counsel selected under the terms of the preceding sentence. The settlement amount shall be calculated on a fully grossed-up basis to cover any related cost consequences of the current tax liability. Any settlement without Interconnection Customer's consent or such written advice will relieve Interconnection Customer from any obligation to indemnify Transmission Provider for the tax at issue in

 the contest.

 5.17.8 Refund. In the event that (a) a private letter ruling is issued to Transmission Provider which holds that any amount paid or the value of any property transferred by Interconnection Customer to Transmission Provider under the terms of this LGIA is not subject to federal income taxation, (b) any legislative change or administrative announcement, notice, ruling or other determination makes it reasonably clear to Transmission Provider in good faith that any amount paid or the value of any property transferred by Interconnection Customer to Transmission Provider under the terms of this LGIA is not taxable to Transmission Provider, (c) any abatement, appeal, protest, or other contest results in a determination that any payments or transfers made by Interconnection Customer to Transmission Provider are not subject to federal income tax, or (d) if Transmission Provider receives a refund from any taxing authority for any overpayment of tax attributable to any payment or property transfer made by Interconnection Customer to Transmission Provider pursuant to this LGIA, Transmission Provider shall promptly refund to Interconnection Customer the following:

 (i) any payment made by Interconnection Customer under this Article 5.17 for taxes that is attributable to the amount determined to be non-taxable, together with interest thereon,

 (ii) interest on any amount paid by Interconnection Customer to Transmission Provider for such taxes which Transmission Provider did not submit to the taxing authority, calculated in accordance with the methodology set forth in FERC's regulations at 18 CFR section35.19a (a)(2)(iii) from the date payment was made by Interconnection Customer to the date Transmission Provider refunds such payment to Interconnection Customer, and

 (iii) with respect to any such taxes paid by Transmission Provider, any refund or credit Transmission Provider receives or to which it may be entitled from any Governmental Authority, interest (or that portion thereof attributable to the payment described in clause (i), above) owed to Transmission Provider for such overpayment of taxes (including any reduction in interest otherwise payable by Transmission Provider to any Governmental Authority resulting from an offset or credit); provided, however, that Transmission Provider will remit such amount promptly to Interconnection Customer only after and to the extent that Transmission Provider has received a tax refund, credit or offset from any Governmental Authority for any applicable overpayment of income tax related to Transmission Provider's Interconnection Facilities.

 The intent of this provision is to leave the Parties, to the extent practicable, in the event that no taxes are due with respect to any payment for Interconnection Facilities and Network Upgrades hereunder, in the same position they would have been in had no such tax payments been made.

 5.17.9 Taxes Other Than Income Taxes. Upon the timely request by Interconnection Customer, and at Interconnection Customer's sole expense, Transmission Provider may appeal, protest, seek abatement of, or otherwise contest any tax (other than federal or state income tax) asserted or assessed against Transmission Provider for which Interconnection Customer may be required to reimburse Transmission Provider under the terms of this LGIA. Interconnection Customer shall pay to Transmission Provider on a periodic basis, as invoiced by Transmission Provider, Transmission Provider's documented reasonable costs of prosecuting such appeal, protest, abatement, or other contest. Interconnection Customer and Transmission Provider shall cooperate in good faith with respect to any such contest. Unless the payment of such taxes is a prerequisite to an appeal or abatement or cannot be deferred, no amount shall be payable by Interconnection Customer to Transmission Provider for such taxes until they are assessed by a final, non-appealable or by any court or agency of competent jurisdiction. In the event that a tax payment is withheld and ultimately due and payable after appeal, Interconnection Customer will be responsible for all taxes, interest and penalties, other than penalties attributable to any delay caused by Transmission Provider.

 5.17.10 Transmission Owners Who Are Not Transmission Providers.

 If Transmission Provider is not the same entity as the Transmission Owner, then (i) all references in this Article 5.17 to Transmission Provider shall be deemed also to refer to and to include the Transmission Owner, as appropriate, and (ii) this LGIA shall not become effective until such Transmission Owner shall have agreed in writing to assume all of the duties and obligations of Transmission Provider under this Article 5.17 of this LGIA.

 5.18 Tax Status. Each Party shall cooperate with the other to maintain the other Party's tax status. Nothing in this LGIA is intended to adversely affect any Transmission Provider's tax exempt status with respect to the issuance of bonds including, but not limited to, Local Furnishing Bonds.

 5.19 Modification.

 5.19.1 General. Either Party may undertake modifications to its facilities. If a Party plans to undertake a modification that reasonably may be expected to affect the other Party's facilities, that Party shall provide to the other Party sufficient information regarding such modification so that the other Party may evaluate the potential impact of such modification prior to commencement of the work. Such information shall be deemed to be confidential hereunder and shall include information concerning the timing of such modifications and whether such modifications are expected to interrupt the flow of electricity from the Large Generating Facility. The Party desiring to perform such work shall provide the relevant drawings, plans, and specifications to the other Party at least ninety (90) Calendar Days in advance of the commencement of the work or such shorter period upon which the Parties may agree, which agreement shall not unreasonably be withheld, conditioned or delayed.

 In the case of Large Generating Facility modifications that do not require Interconnection Customer to submit an Interconnection Request, Transmission Provider shall provide, within thirty (30) Calendar Days (or such other time as the Parties may agree), an estimate of any additional modifications to the Transmission System, Transmission Provider's Interconnection Facilities or Network Upgrades necessitated by such Interconnection Customer modification and a good faith estimate of the costs thereof.

 18.1.1 Indemnified Person. If an Indemnified Person is entitled to indemnification under this Article 18 as a result of a claim by a third party, and the Indemnifying Party fails, after notice and reasonable opportunity to proceed under Article 18.1, to assume the defense of such claim, such Indemnified Person may at the expense of the Indemnifying Party contest, settle or consent to the entry of any

 judgment with respect to, or pay in full, such claim.

 18.1.2 Indemnifying Party. If an Indemnifying Party is obligated to indemnify and hold any Indemnified Person harmless under this Article 18, the amount owing to the Indemnified Person shall be the amount of such Indemnified Person's actual Loss, net of any insurance or other recovery.

 18.1.3 Indemnity Procedures. Promptly after receipt by an Indemnified Person of any claim or notice of the commencement of any action or administrative or legal proceeding or investigation as to which the indemnity provided for in Article 18.1 may apply, the Indemnified Person shall notify the Indemnifying Party of such fact. Any failure of or delay in such notification shall not affect a Party's indemnification obligation unless such failure or delay is materially prejudicial to the Indemnifying Party.

 The Indemnifying Party shall have the right to assume the defense thereof with counsel designated by such Indemnifying Party and reasonably satisfactory to the Indemnified Person. If the defendants in any such action include one or more Indemnified Persons and the Indemnifying Party and if the Indemnified Person reasonably concludes that there may be legal defenses available to it and/or other Indemnified Persons which are different from or additional to those available to the Indemnifying Party, the Indemnified Person shall have the right to select separate counsel to assert such legal defenses and to otherwise participate in the defense of such action on its own behalf. In such instances, the Indemnifying Party shall only be required to pay the fees and expenses of one additional attorney to represent an Indemnified Person or Indemnified Persons having such differing or additional legal defenses.

 The Indemnified Person shall be entitled, at its expense, to participate in any such action, suit or proceeding, the defense of which has been assumed by the Indemnifying Party. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Indemnifying Party (i) shall not be entitled to assume and control the defense of any such action, suit or proceedings if and to the extent that, in the opinion of the Indemnified Person and its counsel, such action, suit or proceeding involves the potential imposition of criminal liability on the Indemnified Person, or there exists a conflict or adversity of interest between the Indemnified Person and the Indemnifying Party, in such event the Indemnifying Party shall pay the reasonable expenses of the Indemnified Person, and (ii) shall not settle or consent to the entry of any judgment in any action, suit or proceeding without the consent of the Indemnified Person, which shall not be reasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed.

Any financing arrangement entered into by Interconnection Customer pursuant to this article will provide that prior to or upon the exercise of the secured party's, trustee's or mortgagee's assignment rights pursuant to said arrangement, the secured creditor, the trustee or mortgagee will notify Transmission Provider of the date and particulars of any such exercise of assignment right(s), including providing the Transmission Provider with proof that it meets the requirements of Articles 11.5 and 18.3. Any attempted assignment that violates this article is void and ineffective. Any assignment under this LGIA shall not relieve a Party of its obligations, nor shall a Party's obligations be enlarged, in whole or in part, by reason thereof. Where required, consent to assignment will not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed.

 Article 20. Severability

 20.1 Severability. If any provision in this LGIA is finally determined to be invalid, void or unenforceable by any court or other Governmental Authority having jurisdiction, such determination shall not invalidate, void or make unenforceable any other provision, agreement or covenant of this LGIA; provided that if Interconnection Customer (or any third party, but only if such third party is not acting at the direction of Transmission Provider) seeks and obtains such a final determination with respect to any provision of the Alternate Option (Article 5.1.2), or the Negotiated Option (Article 5.1.4), then none of these provisions shall thereafter have any force or effect and the Parties' rights and obligations shall be governed solely by the Standard Option (Article 5.1.1).

 Article 21. Comparability

 21.1 Comparability. The Parties will comply with all applicable comparability and code of conduct laws, rules and regulations, as amended from time to time.

 Article 22. Confidentiality

 22.1 Confidentiality. Confidential Information shall include, without limitation, all information relating to a Party's technology, research and development, business affairs, and pricing, and any information supplied by either of the Parties to the other prior to the execution of this LGIA.

 Information is Confidential Information only if it is clearly designated or marked in writing as confidential on the face of the document, or, if the information is conveyed orally or by inspection, if the Party providing the information orally informs the Party receiving the information that the information is confidential.

 If requested by either Party, the other Party shall provide in writing, the basis for asserting that the information referred to in this Article 22 warrants confidential treatment, and the requesting Party may disclose such writing to the appropriate Governmental Authority. Each Party shall be responsible for the costs associated with affording confidential treatment to its information.

 22.1.1 Term. During the term of this LGIA, and for a period of three (3) years after the expiration or termination of this LGIA, except as otherwise provided in this Article 22, each Party shall hold in confidence and shall not disclose to any person Confidential Information.

 22.1.2 Scope. Confidential Information shall not include information that the receiving Party can demonstrate:

 (1) is generally available to the public other than as a result of a disclosure by the receiving Party;

 (2) was in the lawful possession of the receiving Party on a non- confidential basis before receiving it from the disclosing Party;

 (3) was supplied to the receiving Party without restriction by a third party, who, to the knowledge of the receiving Party after due inquiry, was under no obligation to the disclosing Party to keep such information confidential;

 (4) was independently developed by the receiving Party without reference to Confidential Information of the disclosing Party;

 (5) is, or becomes, publicly known, through no wrongful act or omission of the receiving Party or Breach of this LGIA; or

 (6) is required, in accordance with Article 22.1.7 of the LGIA, Order of Disclosure, to be disclosed by any Governmental Authority or is otherwise required to be disclosed by law or subpoena, or is necessary in any legal proceeding establishing rights and obligations under this LGIA.

 Information designated as Confidential Information will no longer be deemed confidential if the Party that designated the information as confidential notifies the other Party that it no longer is confidential.

 22.1.3 Release of Confidential Information. Neither Party shall release or disclose Confidential Information to any other person, except to its Affiliates (limited by the Standards of Conduct requirements), subcontractors, employees, consultants, or to parties who may be or considering providing financing to or equity participation with Interconnection Customer, or to potential purchasers or assignees of Interconnection Customer, on a need-to- know basis in connection with this LGIA, unless such person has first been advised of the confidentiality provisions of this Article 22 and has agreed to comply with such provisions. Notwithstanding the foregoing, a Party providing Confidential Information to any person shall remain primarily responsible for any release of Confidential Information in contravention of this Article 22.

 22.1.4 Rights. Each Party retains all rights, title, and interest in the Confidential Information that each Party discloses to the other Party. The disclosure by each Party to the other Party of Confidential Information shall not be deemed a waiver by either Party or any other person or entity of the right to protect the Confidential Information from public disclosure.

 22.1.5 No Warranties. By providing Confidential Information, neither Party makes any warranties or representations as to its accuracy or completeness. In addition, by supplying Confidential Information, neither Party obligates itself to provide any particular information or Confidential Information to the other Party nor to enter into any further agreements or proceed with any other relationship or joint venture.

 22.1.6 Standard of Care. Each Party shall use at least the same standard of care to protect Confidential Information it receives as it uses to protect its own Confidential Information from unauthorized disclosure, publication or dissemination. Each Party may use Confidential Information solely to fulfill its obligations to the other Party under this LGIA or its regulatory requirements.

 22.1.7 Order of Disclosure. If a court or a Government Authority or entity with the right, power, and apparent authority to do so requests or requires either Party, by subpoena, oral deposition, interrogatories, requests for production of documents, administrative order, or otherwise, to disclose Confidential Information, that Party shall provide the other Party with prompt notice of such request(s) or requirement(s) so that the other Party may seek an appropriate protective order or waive compliance with the terms of this LGIA. Notwithstanding the absence of a protective order or waiver, the Party may disclose such Confidential Information which, in the opinion of its counsel, the Party is legally compelled to disclose. Each Party will use Reasonable Efforts to obtain reliable assurance that confidential treatment will be accorded any Confidential Information so furnished.

 22.1.8 Termination of Agreement. Upon termination of this LGIA for any reason, each Party shall, within ten (10) Calendar Days of receipt of a written request from the other Party, use Reasonable Efforts to destroy, erase, or delete (with such destruction, erasure, and deletion certified in writing to the other Party) or return to the other Party, without retaining copies thereof, any and all written or electronic Confidential Information received from the other Party.

 22.1.9 Remedies. The Parties agree that monetary damages would be inadequate to compensate a Party for the other Party's Breach of its obligations under this Article 22. Each Party accordingly agrees that the other Party shall be entitled to equitable relief, by way of injunction or otherwise, if the first Party Breaches or threatens to Breach its obligations under this Article 22, which equitable relief shall be granted without bond or proof of damages, and the receiving Party shall not plead in defense that there would be an adequate remedy at law. Such remedy shall not be deemed an exclusive remedy for the Breach of this Article 22, but shall be in addition to all other remedies available at law or in equity. The Parties further acknowledge and agree that the covenants contained herein are necessary for the protection of legitimate business interests and are reasonable in scope. No Party, however, shall be liable for indirect, incidental, or consequential or punitive damages of any nature or kind resulting from or arising in connection with this Article 22.

 22.1.10 Disclosure to FERC, its Staff, or a State. Notwithstanding anything in this Article 22 to the contrary, and pursuant to 18 CFR section 1b.20, if FERC or its staff, during the course of an investigation or otherwise, requests information from one of the Parties that is otherwise required to be maintained in confidence pursuant to this LGIA, the Party shall provide the requested information to FERC or its staff, within the time provided for in the request for information. In providing the information to FERC or its staff, the Party must, consistent with 18 CFR section 388.112, request that the information be treated as confidential and non- public by FERC and its staff and that the information be withheld from public disclosure. Parties are prohibited from notifying the other Party to this LGIA prior to the release of the Confidential Information to FERC or its staff. The Party shall notify the other Party to the LGIA when it is notified by FERC or its staff that a request to release Confidential Information has been received by FERC, at which time either of the Parties may respond before such information would be made public, pursuant to 18 CFR Section 388.112. Requests from a state regulatory body conducting a confidential investigation shall be treated in a similar manner if consistent with the applicable state rules and regulations.

 22.1.11 Subject to the exception in Article 22.1.10, any information that a Party claims is competitively sensitive, commercial or financial information under this LGIA ("Confidential Information") shall not be disclosed by the other Party to any person not employed or retained by the other Party, except to the extent disclosure is (i) required by law; (ii) reasonably deemed by the disclosing Party to be required to be disclosed in connection with a dispute between or among the Parties, or the defense of litigation or dispute; (iii) otherwise permitted by consent of the other Party, such consent not to be unreasonably withheld; or (iv) necessary to fulfill its obligations under this LGIA or as a transmission service provider or a Control Area operator including disclosing the Confidential Information to an RTO or ISO or to a regional or national reliability organization. The Party asserting confidentiality shall notify the other Party in writing of the information it claims is confidential. Prior to any disclosures of the other Party's Confidential Information under this subparagraph, or if any third party or Governmental Authority makes any request or demand for any of the information described in this subparagraph, the disclosing Party agrees to promptly notify the other Party in writing and agrees to assert confidentiality and cooperate with the other Party in seeking to protect the Confidential Information from public disclosure by confidentiality agreement, protective order or other reasonable measures.
