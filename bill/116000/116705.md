 ORDINANCE _________________

 AN ORDINANCE concerning public spaces on the Central Waterfront; establishing a Committee on Central Waterfront Partnerships to advise the City on issues relating to designing, developing and managing a series of premiere public spaces on the Central Waterfront; appointing Committee members; reaffirming and establishing principles; and directing the Department of Planning and Development to develop a project framework to guide its design.

 WHEREAS, the removal of the Alaskan Way Viaduct, creation of new public space on the Central Waterfront, and replacement of the aging Elliott Bay Seawall presents a unique opportunity to reconnect Seattle to its waterfront and remove a structure that casts a blighting shadow on Seattle's downtown; and

 WHEREAS, in 2003 the City began a public process for developing a community vision for the Central Seattle waterfront; and

 WHEREAS, in 2004 the City, the Planning and Design Commissions jointly sponsored public forums to establish guiding principles for reclaiming the Central Waterfront and reconnecting it with downtown, and the City Council subsequently adopted those principles through Resolutions 30664 and 30724; and

 WHEREAS, these Resolutions called for making public use a primary objective for redeveloping the Central Waterfront, linking the waterfront with inland areas so that each area reinforces the other and contributes to a cohesive Downtown, and engaging the public in the decision-making process; and

 WHEREAS, in 2006 the City's Department of Planning and Development published the Waterfront Concept Plan, which provided concepts for reclaiming the Central Waterfront for public use consistent with Resolution 30664, including locations for public open spaces, environmental improvements, and connections to the downtown core; and

 WHEREAS, in 2008 the State and City agreed to principles for replacing the Alaskan Way Viaduct based on feedback from a stakeholder committee comprised of individuals representing business, labor, environmental, and neighborhood interests; and

 WHEREAS, in January 2009 the Governor, King County Executive, and Mayor of Seattle reached consensus on an Alaskan Way Viaduct and Seawall Replacement Program ("AWVSRP"),which included funding to complete street and public space improvements along Alaskan Way, consistent with feedback received from the stakeholder committee; and

 WHEREAS, in April 2009 the Washington State Legislature passed Engrossed Substitute Senate Bill 5768 and the Governor signed the Bill into law, providing funding for the AWVSRP and the surface of Alaskan Way along the waterfront; and

 WHEREAS, in October 2009 the City authorized execution of a Memorandum of Agreement ("MOA") with the State of Washington reaffirming a mutual commitment to work collaboratively to complete the AWVSRP and recognizing the City and State's respective funding and implementation responsibilities; and

 WHEREAS, effective collaboration with a range of partners and civic organizations is essential to large civic projects such as that proposed for the Central Waterfront, including building a broad coalition to shape the project's vision, organization and process to ensure that it is successfully completed; and

 WHEREAS, it is critical at this stage of the project that the City recognize the essential role such partnerships will play to ensure the success of the Central Waterfront as a series of public spaces for all Seattleites, with linkages to the broader area, including neighborhoods bordering Elliott Bay and major City Center destinations, and that the City proactively develop these partnerships; and

 WHEREAS, it is also critical at this stage of the project to organize and compile the City's policy and planning work into a clear and cohesive project framework, to direct subsequent work to design the Central Waterfront public spaces in the context of the AWVSRP, and to ensure all such work is consistent with City policies; NOW, THEREFORE,

 BE IT ORDAINED BY THE CITY OF SEATTLE AS FOLLOWS:

 Section 1. Committee on Central Waterfront Partnerships.

 A. Committee Established: The City hereby establishes a Committee on Central Waterfront Partnerships ("the Committee").

 B. Functions: The Committee shall advise the City on the strategies and partnerships necessary to successfully design, develop, and manage a series of premiere public spaces (the "public space") along the Central Waterfront in connection with the Alaskan Way Viaduct Seawall Replacement Program (AWVSRP). Among other things, the Committee will:

 a. Consider how the City can form partnerships with civic organizations in developing the project's overall vision, overseeing its implementation, and taking a meaningful role in its long-term operation and stewardship;

 b. Advise the City on ways to engage the public in developing public spaces on the Central Waterfront with linkages to the broader City, including neighborhoods bordering Elliott Bay and major Center City destinations;

 c. Oversee work associated with development of the project framework described in Section 2 of this ordinance; and;

 d. Recommend effective models for the management, use and programming of new public spaces on the Central Waterfront.

 C. Authority: The Committee shall have the authority to appoint a chair or chairs, establish a meeting schedule, establish subcommittees, conduct votes, and otherwise establish those procedures necessary to perform its functions. The Committee also shall have the authority to remove any member who is absent without excuse from two or more Committee meetings.

 D. Membership and Appointment: The Committee shall have 37 members, who shall serve for the duration of the Committee's existence. The Committee shall include one member of the Seattle Design Commission, one member of the Seattle Planning Commission, and one member of the Seattle Board of Park Commissioners. The Directors of the Departments of Parks and Recreation, Planning and Development, and Transportation, and a representative from the Port of Seattle shall be ex officio members of the Committee. The remaining 30 at-large members shall broadly represent key stakeholders, and shall include civic leaders with expertise in public- private partnerships, public finance, public space design and management, historic preservation, sustainable design, multi-modal transportation, and arts and culture. Committee members who are removed or resign shall be replaced by the President of the City Council.

 E. Members Appointed: The City Council hereby appoints the 37 Committee positions as named in Attachment 1 to this ordinance.

 F. Committee Duration: The Committee shall sunset on December 31, 2010, unless its continued existence is authorized by future ordinance.

 G. Meetings: the Committee shall hold its first meeting within 45 days of the effective date of this ordinance. Meetings shall be conducted in a manner consistent with the Open Public Meetings Act, RCW 42.30.

 H. Reports and Recommendations: The Committee shall provide regular progress reports to the Mayor and City Council as requested, and shall provide its recommendations to the Mayor and City Council by August 2010.

 I. Staffing: The Committee shall be staffed by the Department of Planning and Development (DPD), which will serve as the lead department overseeing the Committee's work. DPD will work in collaboration with the Departments of Parks and Recreation, Seattle Department of Transportation, and other City departments and public agencies as needed. Appropriate resources to complete this work are included in the proposed 2010 Budget.

 Section 2. Project Framework: The Department of Planning and Development is directed to develop a project framework ("framework") to guide the design of public spaces on the Central Waterfront as part of the AWVSRP. The Mayor and City Council hereby reaffirm the principles for the Central Waterfront expressed in Resolutions 30664 and 30724 and Ordinance 122406, which along with the 2006 Waterfront Concept Plan, shall form the basis for this framework. Development of this framework and subsequent design of the public space for the Central Waterfront should also reflect the following specific principles:

 A. The new surface Alaskan Way should be a "complete street" that gracefully accommodates pedestrian, bicycle, and freight movements as well as general traffic; has a maximum of four through-travel lanes north of Colman Dock with signalized crossings at east-west streets; and is located on the east side of the right-of-way to maximize public use of the water's edge;

 B. The waterfront should consist of a series of flexible, diverse public spaces that connect to and give their adjacent neighborhoods a presence on the water. These spaces should be linked by continuous design elements that create an integrated experience such as a north-south pedestrian promenade;

 C. Waterfront public spaces should be active and inviting. Their design, programming and management should foster a mix of social, recreational, and commercial activities of a character appropriate for public space on both water and land;

 D. Seattle's rich history is embodied in the waterfront. Historic features, water-dependent uses, and indigenous people's use of the site should be incorporated into the project and interpreted for future generations; and

 E. Seattle's waterfront should set an example for sustainable development of the Puget Sound shoreline. Its design should improve intertidal habitat, create healthy ecological interaction with uplands, support salmon migration, and offer ways for people to touch and engage the water.

 DPD shall distill the above principles, together with existing Central Waterfront-related City policies, into a clear and cohesive statement of the context, scope and key priorities for the design of public spaces on the Central Waterfront as part of the AWVSRP. In doing so DPD should collaborate with the Seattle Department of Parks and Recreation, the Seattle Department of Transportation, Seattle Public Utilities, Seattle City Light and other relevant public agencies. DPD shall provide regular progress reports to the Mayor and City Council as requested, and shall propose a draft of the framework for consideration by the Mayor and City Council by December 2010. Appropriate resources to complete this work are included in the proposed 2010 Budget.

 Section 3. Effective Date: This ordinance shall take effect and be in force thirty (30) days from and after its approval by the Mayor, but if not approved and returned by the Mayor within ten (10) days after presentation, it shall take effect as provided by Municipal Code Section 1.04.020.
