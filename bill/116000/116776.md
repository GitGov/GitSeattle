 WHEREAS, the Council finds that the amendments to be adopted are consistent with the Growth Management Act, and will protect and promote the health, safety, and welfare of the general public; NOW, THEREFORE,

 BE IT ORDAINED BY THE CITY OF SEATTLE AS FOLLOWS:

 Section 1. The Seattle Comprehensive Plan, as last amended by Ordinance 122832, is amended as follows:

 A. Amend the Future Land Use Map to adjust the Rainier Beach residential urban village boundary and designate the land shown on Attachment A as a Multi-Family Residential Area.

 B. Amend the Future Land Use Map to designate land in the Roosevelt residential urban village as a Multi-Family Residential Area or Commercial/Mixed Use Area as shown on Attachment B.

 C. Amend the Future Land Use Map to designate the land in South Downtown as Downtown Area as shown on Attachment C.

 D. Add a new Neighborhood Planning Northgate Policy 8.5 as follows:

 Support future potential rezones to higher intensity designations in the North Core Subarea. In considering such rezones, pay particular attention to the development of an environment that creates a network of pedestrian connections and that encourages pedestrian activity, among other considerations associated with a rezone review.

 E. Amend the Neighborhood Planning Element map of the Northgate Planning Area, Urban Center and Core Area to designate the Northgate North Core Subarea as shown on Attachment D.

 F. Add a new Sand Point Amendment policy LU6.5 as follows:

 Allow residential uses in Building 9 and permit limited commercial uses in portions of this existing building that are not suitable for residential use, as a way to use the space efficiently and to generate revenue that can reduce the cost of the housing provided.

 G. Amend Housing Policy 9 as follows:

 Promote housing preservation, development and affordability in coordination with the Seattle Transit Plan, particularly~~transit plans and~~ in proximity to light rail stations and other transit hubs. Coordinate housing, land use, human services, urban design, infrastructure and environmental strategies to support pedestrian-friendly communities that are well-served by public transit~~at light rail station areas and other transit hubs~~.

 H. Add a new Housing Policy 9.5 as follows:

 When using federal, state, local, and private resources to preserve, rehabilitate or redevelop properties for affordable housing, consider access to transit service and estimated household transportation costs.

 I. Amend Housing Policy 18 as follows:

 Promote methods of more efficiently using or adapting the city's housing stock to enable changing households to remain in the same home or neighborhood for many years. Strategies may include sharing homes, allowing attached and detached accessory units in single-family zones, encouraging housing designs that are easily augmented to accommodate children ("grow houses"), or other methods considered through neighborhood planning.

 J. Amend Housing Policy 20 as follows:

 Promote and foster, where appropriate, innovative and non-traditional housing types such as co-housing, live/work housing and attached and detached accessory dwelling units, as alternative means of accommodating residential growth and providing affordable housing options.

 K. Amend the discussion at C. Location-Specific Land Use Policies in the Land Use Element as follows:

 The basic zoning categories described in Section B, are augmented here by policies that respond to specific characteristics of an area. For example, historic districts are governed by a basic zoning category as well as regulations that respond to the unique historic characteristics of an area. This section provides the policy foundation to guide how the City adjusts its regulations to respond to unique environments, particularly those created by: major institutions, historic districts and landmarks, arts and cultural districts, environmentally critical areas and shorelines.

 L. Amend Land Use Goal 31 as follows:

 Provide flexibility in, or supplement, standard zone provisions to achieve special public purposes where circumstances warrant. Such areas include shoreline areas, airport height districts, historic landmark and special review districts, major institutions, arts and cultural districts, subarea plan districts, areas around high-capacity transit stations, and other appropriate locations.

 M. Add a new section to the Land Use Element, to be called "C-5 Cultural Overlay Districts."

 N. Add a new Land Use Policy 271 as follows:

 Encourage the creation of cultural districts to support arts and cultural uses and the economic benefits they provide. Use the creation of cultural districts as a tool to carry out neighborhood plan recommendations and other city plans that promote arts and cultural uses.

 O. Add a new Land Use Policy 272 as follows:

 Allow regulations and incentives to be adopted specifically for designated cultural districts. Allow adopted guidelines or regulations to modify, exempt, or supersede the standards of the underlying zone to encourage arts and cultural uses.

 P. Amend the Future Land Use Map to adjust the North Rainier hub urban village boundary and designate the land shown on Attachment E as a Multi-Family Residential Area.

 Section 2. This ordinance shall take effect and be in force thirty days from and after its approval by the Mayor, but if not approved and returned by the Mayor within ten days after presentation, it shall take effect as provided by Municipal Code Section 1.04.020.
