 Guardrails and handrailsd 200i

 Guardrails in-fill componentsf 50i

 Passenger vehicle garagesa 50a

 Rooms other than sleeping 40 rooms

 Sleeping rooms 30

 For SI: 1 pound per square foot = 0.0479 kPa, 1 square inch = 645 mm2, 1 pound = 4.45 N.

 a. Elevated garage floors shall be capable of supporting a 2,000- pound load applied over a 20-square-inch area.

 b. Attics without storage are those where the maximum clear height between joist and rafter is less than 42 inches, or where there are not two or more adjacent trusses with the same web configuration capable of containing a rectangle 42 inches high by 2 feet wide, or greater, located within the plane of the truss. For attics without storage, this live load need not be assumed to act concurrently with any other live load requirements.

 c. Individual stair treads shall be designed for the uniformly distributed live load or a 300-pound concentrated load acting over an area of 4 square inches, whichever produces the greater stresses.

 d. A single concentrated load applied in any direction at any point along the top.

 e. See Section ~~R502.2.1~~R502.2.2 for decks attached to exterior walls.

 f. Guard in-fill components (all those except the handrail), balusters and panel fillers shall be designed to withstand a horizontally applied normal load of 50 pounds on an area equal to 1 square foot. This load need not be assumed to act concurrently with any other live load requirement.

 g. For attics with limited storage and constructed with trusses, this live load need be applied only to those portions of the bottom chord where there are two or more adjacent trusses with the same web configuration capable of containing a rectangle 42 inches high or greater by 2 feet wide or greater, located within the plane of the truss. The rectangle shall fit between the top of the bottom chord and the bottom of any other truss member, provided that each of the following criteria is met:

 1. The attic area is accessible by a pull-down stairway or framed opening in accordance with Section R807.1; and

 2. The truss has a bottom chord pitch less than 2:12.

 h. Attic spaces served by a fixed stair shall be designed to support the minimum live load specified for sleeping rooms.

 i. Glazing used in handrail assemblies and guards shall be designed with a safety factor of 4. The safety factor shall be applied to each of the concentrated loads applied to the top of the rail, and to the load on the in-fill components. These loads shall be determined independent of one another, and loads are assumed not to occur with any other live load.

 ***

Cripple walls supporting exterior walls or interior braced wall panels as required in Section R403.1.2 and R403.1.2.1 shall be supported on ~~continuous~~ foundations.

 Section 6. Section 703 of the Seattle Residential Code, which Code was adopted by Ordinance 122533 and which adoption is reflected in Section 22.150.010 of the Seattle Municipal Code, is amended as follows:

 ***

 R703

 EXTERIOR COVERING

[W] R703.1 General. Exterior walls shall provide the building with a weather-resistant exterior wall envelope. The exterior wall envelope shall include flashing as described in Section R703.8. The exterior wall envelope shall be designed and constructed in a manner that prevents the accumulation of water within the wall assembly by providing a water-resistant barrier behind the exterior veneer as required by Section R703.2 and a means of draining water that enters the assembly to the exterior. ~~Protection against condensation in the exterior wall assembly shall be provided in accordance with the Washington State Energy Code (chapter 51-11 WAC).~~

 Exceptions:

 1. A weather-resistant exterior wall envelope shall not be required over concrete or masonry walls designed in accordance with Chapter 6 and flashed according to Section R703.7 or R703.8.

 2. Compliance with the requirements for a means of drainage, and the requirements of Section R703.2 and R703.8, shall not be required for an exterior wall envelope that has been demonstrated to resist wind- driven rain through testing of the exterior wall envelope, including joints, penetrations and intersections with dissimilar materials, in accordance with ASTM E 331 under the following conditions:

 2.1 Exterior wall envelope test assemblies shall include at least one opening, one control joint, one wall/eave interface and one wall sill. All tested openings and penetrations shall be representative of the intended end-use configuration.

 2.2 Exterior wall envelope test assemblies shall be at least 4 feet (1219 mm) by 8 feet (2438 mm) in size.

 2.3 Exterior wall assemblies shall be tested at a minimum differential pressure of 6.24 pounds per square foot (299 Pa).

 2.4 Exterior wall envelope assemblies shall be subjected to a minimum test exposure duration of 2 hours.

 The exterior wall envelope design shall be considered to resist wind-driven rain where the results of testing indicate that water did not penetrate: Control joints in the exterior wall envelope; joints at the perimeter of openings penetration; or intersections of terminations with dissimilar materials.

3. The requirement for a means of drainage shall not be construed to mean an air space cavity under the exterior cladding for an exterior wall clad with panel siding made of plywood, engineered wood, hardboard, or fiber cement. A water-resistive barrier as required by Section R703.2 and Table R703.4 is required on exterior walls.  Interpretation R703.1: According to Section R703.1 exception 3, a rain-screen or similar construction method is not required for most exterior siding and cladding, and single-wall construction is allowed. Drainage methods should conform to the manufacturer's installation instructions and other sections of the Seattle Residential Code.

Note: The "water-resistive barrier" behind the exterior wall covering provides drainage of the water that may enter an exterior wall envelope. If water penetrates the exterior wall covering, the felt paper or other approved material will direct the water to the bottom of the wall where it will escape to the exterior.

 ***

 Section 7. Section M1501 of the Seattle Residential Code, which Code was adopted by Ordinance 122533 and which adoption is reflected in Section 22.150.010 of the Seattle Municipal Code, is amended as follows:

 [W] M1501.1 Outdoor discharge. The air removed by every mechanical exhaust system shall be discharged to the outdoors. Air shall not be exhausted into an attic, soffit, ridge vent or crawl space.

 Exception: Whole-house ~~ventilation-type~~cooling attic fans that discharge into the attic space of dwelling units having private attics shall be permitted.

Interpretation R1501: Fans providing whole house ventilation shall comply with the Ventilation and Indoor Air Quality Code, which prohibits them from discharging air into attics. The exception to Section M1501 is intended to allow attic fans to pull cooler air from the outdoors and discharge that air into private attic space. See WAC 51-51-1501.

 ***

 Section 8. Section G2439.5 of the Seattle Residential Code, which Code was adopted by Ordinance 122533 and which adoption is reflected in Section 22.150.010 of the Seattle Municipal Code, is amended by adding a new subsection as follows:

 G2439.5 (614.5) Clothes dryer ducts. Exhaust ducts for domestic clothes dryers shall be constructed of metal and shall have a smooth interior finish. The exhaust duct shall be a minimum nominal size of 4 inches (102 mm) in diameter. The entire exhaust system shall be supported and secured in place. The male end of the duct at overlapped duct joints shall extend in the direction of airflow. Clothes dryer transition ducts used to connect the appliance to the exhaust duct system shall be metal and limited to a single length not to exceed 8 feet (2438 mm) in length and shall be listed and labeled for the application.

[W] G2439.5.3 Protection required. Plates or clips shall be placed where nails or screws from finish or other work are likely to penetrate the clothes dryer exhaust duct. Plates or clips shall be placed on the finished face of all framing members where there is less than 1 1/4 inches (32 mm) between the duct and the finished face of the framing material. The plate or clip shall be steel  not less than 1/16 inch (1.59 mm) in thickness and of sufficient width to protect the duct.
