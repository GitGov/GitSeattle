 ORDINANCE ____________________

 AN ORDINANCE relating to land use and zoning and signs in the Seattle Municipal Code amending Sections 23.55.014 and 23.72.004 and adding a new Section 23.55.032 relating to signs within the Sand Point Overlay District.

 WHEREAS, in 1997 the City Council passed Ordinance 118624 creating the Sand Point Overlay District ("Overlay District") to guide reuse of properties and buildings from the former Naval Air Station Sand Point, and to integrate the property into the City of Seattle as a multi-purpose regional center that provides expanded opportunity for recreation, education, arts, cultural, and community activities, increased public access to the shoreline and enhanced open space and natural areas, opportunities for affordable housing and community and social services, and expanded opportunity for low-impact economic development uses; and

 WHEREAS, the Overlay District allows for non-residential uses that are not normally permitted in the underlying residential zones, but are permitted due to the unique nature of the district, and which permitted uses were most recently updated in 2008 by Ordinance 122829, which did not include any updates to existing sign standards appropriate for this district; and

 WHEREAS, in 2004 the City hired a consultant to develop a signage and wayfinding master plan for Warren G. Magnuson Park ("Magnuson Park"), in which the Overlay District is located, that included an inventory and analysis of existing signs and a separate public review process, which resulted in a Final Signage and Wayfinding Master Plan governing commercial and non-commercial signs for the entire Magnuson Park, all of which are unique to the Overlay District; and

 WHEREAS, the current underlying single-family and multifamily zones within the Overlay District do not adequately regulate signs for permitted uses in the Overlay District, which includes park area and uses, multifamily uses in new and historic structures, and historic industrial and office buildings that now house educational, environmental, and cultural organizations that are not generally permitted in the underlying zones; and

 WHEREAS, this unique combination of uses and historic structures in the Overlay District requires sign standards that are different from the types of signage allowed for residential or commercial uses that are found outside of the Overlay District, as well as for other parks within those residential zones, to balance the City's interests in aesthetics, safety, and communication; and

 WHEREAS, the need to modify the existing regulations for signs within the Overlay District has increased significantly as buildings have been renovated and new public and private commercial uses have been located within the Overlay District; and

 WHERAS, the buildings within the Overlay District are oriented toward streets and rights-of-way internal to Magnuson Park and the Overlay District and not towards Sand Point Way NE, the main arterial abutting the Overlay District, and have made wayfinding for the mix of uses allowed in the Overlay District problematic; and

 WHEREAS, the new regulations for signs in the Overlay District will allow for greatly improved visitor wayfinding once visitors enter the Overlay District off of Sand Point Way NE; and

 WHEREAS, the purposes of the Sign Code are to regulate commercial signs and to protect the public interests in avoiding driver distraction and visual blight caused by signs, while allowing needed communication with the public through signs that invite rather than demand the public's attention, and encouraging the use of signs that enhance the visual environment of the city; NOW, THEREFORE,

 BE ORDAINED BY THE CITY OF SEATTLE AS FOLLOWS:

 Section 1. Subsections 23.55.014A and B of the Seattle Municipal Code, which

 subsections were last amended by Ordinance 121477, are amended as follows:

 23.55.014 Off-premises signs

 A. Advertising Signs.

 1. No advertising sign shall be erected, or constructed, unless an existing advertising sign is relocated or reconstructed at a new location. An advertising sign may be relocated or reconstructed if:

 a. The existing advertising sign was lawfully erected and after the effective date of the ordinances codified in this section, is registered to pursuant to subsection F of this section;

 b. The advertising sign is located on a site or in a zone where it is not permitted, except as provided in subsection  A.1.c  of this ((~~s))~~ S ection  23.55.014 ;

 e. The construction permit for the relocated or reconstructed advertising sign is issued during the pendency of the demolition permit for the existing sign;

 f. The advertising sign face does not increase in size; and

 g. The advertising sign is relocated to an area with the same or more intensive zoning. Areas in which advertising signs are allowed are listed below from least intense to most intense zoning, and zones listed on the same line are considered of the same intensity. Zones which do not allow advertising signs shall be considered less intense zones for the purpose of relocation. This list is for purposes of this criterion only.

 h. The number of relocated advertising signs does not exceed ~~twelve~~ ((~~(~~12~~)~~)) structure locations per year or ((~~twenty-four (~~))24((~~)~~)) sign face locations per year, excluding relocations pursuant to subsection G of this ((~~s~~)) S ection  23.55.014 .

 2. For purposes of relocation, sign owners maintain the right to relocation.

 3. Wall signs cannot be relocated.

 6. No variances shall be permitted from the provisions of this subsection A.

 B. Off-premises Directional Signs. The maximum area of any off-premises directional sign shall be ((~~one hundred (~~))100((~~)~~)) square feet, with a maximum vertical dimension of ((~~ten feet (~~))10((~~')~~))  feet and a maximum horizontal dimension of ((~~twenty feet (~~))20((~~')~~))  feet,  except for off-premises signs allowed under Section 23.55.032.G .
