 Attachment 2: Amendments to Appendix H to the Consolidated Plan for Housing and Community Development

 Amendments to Appendix H to the 2005-2008 Consolidated Plan for Housing and Community Development, as amended in Section 6 of the 2008 Update to the Consolidated Plan

 1. Add the following subsection to the Section entitled Homeownership Program Policies, after the subsection entitled Homebuyer Education and Counseling (found in the original 2008 Update at the bottom of page 61).

 "Foreclosure Prevention

 During 2008, OH will develop a pilot Foreclosure Prevention Program to provide stabilization loans to low-income homeowners at risk of mortgage default."

 2. Make the following changes in the subsection entitled HomeWise Program Policies (found in the original 2008 Update at page 65):

 HomeWise Program Policies

 OH's HomeWise Program provides for low-interest rehabilitation loans and weatherization grants primarily for the purpose of improving the health, safety, and energy efficiency of housing for low-income households. Income limits for rehabilitation loans vary by fund source, but in no case exceed 80% of MI. The maximum individual rehab loan is $45,000, with a waiver by the OH Director allowing up to $10,000 additional (for an overall total of $55,000) due to demonstrated health and safety needs. Interest rates generally are set at 3% simple interest. Depending on the circumstances of the individual household, tThe loans may generally be amortized or deferred. HomeWise forgivable grants are available, up to $10,000, for lead-based paint abatement if required in a rehabilitation project. Grant terms require full repayment if the home is sold within 5 years and provide for forgiveness after 5 years.

 The program generally gives priority to loans for improving health and safety, and for curing code violations. For a time period through December 31, 2007, the program will also give priority for repairs that address exterior dilapidation or conditions that would contribute to neighborhood revitalization in the Rainier Valley/Beacon Hill Housing Investment Area in Southeast Seattle.

 Weatherization grants are made for energy efficiency-related repairs in owner- and renter- occupied single-family homes and eligible multifamily rental properties. The income limits for such grants vary by both fund source and tenure of the household (i.e. owner, renter).

 Attachment 2 to Ordinance -- Amendments to Appendix H to the Consolidated Plan for Housing and Community Development

 Attachment 3: Section 2 - Allocation of Consolidated Plan Funds (amended May 2008), with amended Appendix A to the Consolidated Plan

 SECTION 2 - ALLOCATION OF CONSOLIDATED PLAN FUNDS

Amended May 2008 (ver. 042208)  This Section 2, as amended May 2008, reflects changes to the original 2008 Update. Additions are underlined and deletions are shown by ~~strikethrough~~. These changes result from the receipt of the actual allocation amounts from U.S. HUD for the four formula grant programs. The actual amounts differ from our original estimated amounts quite significantly for HOME and CDBG. Notwithstanding other references to estimated dollar amounts in other parts of this document, these figures and the amended Section 5 Table of Proposed Projects shall constitute the actual plan for the receipt and use of funds. Attached to this Section 2 is an amended Appendix A to the Consolidated Plan.

~~~~Summary of Revenues~~Estimates~~& Allocation Plan

~~Overall, the revenue picture for 2008 looks stable, relative to 2007 (as amended by the 2007 Substantial Amendment, City Ordinance 122433). Revenues from the federal government are estimated to remain similar to 2007, though the American Dream Downpayment Initiative program is expected to expire at the end of the 2007 federal fiscal year. As of the middle of July, 2007, as this proposed plan is being written, Congress is not expected to reauthorize the program.~~The actual 2008 allocations from the federal government result in a decrease to the Consolidated Plan funds by $598,145 from the amounts adopted in November 2007, when the original 2008 Update was transmitted to HUD. This continues the trend of decreasing federal resources, especially for CDBG, described in Section 1. In response to this decrease, efforts were made, successfully, to identify other funds that could be available to support the programs and activities intended to be supported by the Consolidated Plan funds.

 CDBG

~~This 2008 Update estimates that the City's CDBG entitlement will be $12,587,742, the same allocation as in 2007.~~The 2008 CDBG formula allocation is $12,022,310, roughly $565,000 less than what we received in 2007. Program income is expected to be higher than in 2007 due to anticipated program income increases in the Homebuyer ($550,000) program and multifamily loan repayments ($500,000) in the Office of Housing. Total CDBG available resources are:

$12,022,310Annual Entitlement$500,000Multifamily loan repayments$550,000Homebuyer loan repayments$707,572Homewise loan repayments 2008$36,692Unexpended public service contracts from 2006 and 2007$129,625Unexpended funds for administration, planning, and program management from 2006 and 2007$143,950Cancelled community facilities project from 2002$261,010Homewise program income from prior years$14,351,159Total CDBG Program for 2008~~Total anticipated PI is around $2 million, vs. $1.6 million in 2007. Coupled with previously-authorized expenditures of prior year program income and an anticipated recapture of $60,000, the total CDBG program expenditures will be $14.5 million.~~

 HOME/ADDI

 In November of 2007, Seattle expected to receive~~d~~ an appropriation in 2008 of $4,269,638 from HUD for the Home Investment Partnership program, the same amount as we had in 2007 . ~~We are planning for the same amount in 2008. We anticipate losing funding under the ADDI program of HOME, which in 2007 amounted to $92,338.~~The actual appropriation, excluding ADDI, was $4,142,653. On the other hand, we expected the ADDI program to expire in 2008, but we received a $37,308 allocation from it.

 Program Income from the HOME Program is expected to remain relatively stable at $1 million (Homebuyer and Rental Housing loan repayment program income). We are also bringing forward $12,083 in administrative savings from prior years to fund the 2008 program, for a total HOME/ADDI budget of $5,192,044. (In addition, $64,895 of prior year CDBG program income is designated to supplement the program to compensate for the reduced 2008 allocation.)

 HOPWA and ESG

 In 2007, Seattle's portion of the HOPWA and ESG programs were $1,604,000 and $544,397 respectively. ~~As of the summer of 2007, we do not anticipate significant changes to these amounts.~~The actual allocations for 2008 are, respectively, $1,663,000 and $542,360.

~~All of these estimates are based on Seattle CDBG Administration's assessment of Congressional action on the 2008 federal budget as of mid-July, 2007. These estimates are subject to change as summer closes and Congress wraps up work on the FY2008 budget. Changes in revenues, and their effects on program allocations, will be reflected in a substantial amendment to the 2008 Update, compiled in the spring of 2008. Generally, HUD formally informs jurisdictions of their current fiscal year allocations during the spring of any given year.~~

 The allocation of these funds is highlighted in the chart on ~~this~~the preceding page. Specific activity detail is provided by the 2008 Table of Proposed Projects (TPP), included as Section Five of this document. The allocation of Consolidated Plan funds is made in accordance with the stated policies and strategies contained in the 2005 - 2008 Consolidated Plan, as amended by the annual updates from 2006 - 2008. Funds are appropriated to the following City departments for the identified purposes:

Human Services Department (HSD): activities are focused on supporting services that assist homeless persons and families out of homelessness and into appropriate housing, supporting non-profit social service organizations with their facility needs, and CDBG Administration.

Office of Housing (OH): funds are used to create affordable housing options for low- and moderate-income Seattle residents.

Office of Economic Development (OED: provides support for the economic development of low-income neighborhoods and businesses with a variety of business development products, and support for the neighborhood revitalization activities of the Southeast Seattle Neighborhood Revitalization Strategy Area.

 2008 Revised APPENDIX A

 to the 2005-2008 Consolidated Plan

 Allocation Guidelines and Resources Overview

 The 2005 - 2008 Consolidated Plan anticipates the receipt and use of approximately $96 million of federal funds in the four Consolidated Plan funding programs over the course of the four years. In spite of recent reductions in allocation amounts from the federal government, especially in the CDBG program, the City of Seattle's intent for these funds remains to help support the achievement of the City's housing, human services, and community development goals.

 Other federal, state, and local resources will be used to achieve these goals as well. Some of these other sources are utilized directly by the City and others are used by community-based non- profit organizations in conjunction with City CDBG, HOPWA, ESG, or HOME funds. Significant other federal sources include funds from the McKinney program, funds for rent certificates and vouchers, and tax exempt lending programs. State funds include proceeds from the State Housing Trust Fund and the State Community Services Facilities Loan Program. Local funds from the City of Seattle come from the General Fund and a seven-year Housing Levy.

 The use of private resources such as debt financing, New Markets Tax Credits, equity, expertise, materials, donations, land and buildings, is an essential element of Seattle's development of affordable housing and public (community) facilities. Major sources of private investment are United Way, which increasingly supports service costs connected to emergency housing and homeless services; Impact Capital, which supports interim financing, predevelopment financing, and tax credit projects; many local foundations, which make both operating and capital grants for housing development and operation; local banks; tax credit proceeds; owner equity, match, labor, and expertise; and thousands of hours of citizens' time spent planning and revising policy documents governing Seattle's activities in these goal areas.

 2008 CDBG ~~Revenue Estimate and~~Allocation Guidelines

~~The current CDBG entitlement projection for 2008 is $12,587,742, exactly the same as received in 2007. Program income in 2008 comes from the Office of Housing and is assumed to be $135,531 from HomeWise loan repayments, $500,000 from the Multifamily Loan Program, and $550,000 from the Homebuyer program. An additional $60,000 is expected to be available from previously-funded projects that do not spend out their total budget. Prior year's program income combined with this year's entitlement and program income estimates provide be basis for a 2008 proposed CDBG budget of $14,546,705.~~

 Since 2006, the City's broad objectives for CDBG funds have been to support the Ten-Year Plan to End Homelessness and to support economic revitalization in Southeast Seattle. The funding guidelines for 2008 remain unchanged from 2007:

 * The City will continue to maximize the amount of CDBG funding for public services while mitigating major fluctuations in the public services cap caused by fluctuating program revenue. Specifically, float loan repayments will not be factored into the calculation of the cap. The inclusion of float loan repayments in the cap calculation has caused significant variation in the budget over recent years, forcing the City to reduce public services spending in years where there was no float loan income.

 * Public services funds shall focus on activities that support the region's Ten-Year Plan to End Homelessness.

 * The City has committed to support neighborhood revitalization in the Rainier Valley through the Rainier Valley Community Development Fund. Ordinance 121763, adopted April 2005, adopted a Substitute Funding Agreement with the Central Puget Sound Regional Transit Authority. Following a full allocation to the public services cap, CDBG funds will be allocated to support the intent of the Substitute Funding Agreement.

 * Remaining CDBG resources shall be used to support physical and economic development activities throughout the City, and CDBG administration activities.

 * All programs funded by CDBG, whether they are operated by City departments or by community-based organizations, will be consistent with the goals of the Consolidated Plan.

 * CDBG allocations for programs operated by City departments will be determined through the City's budget process.

 * The City's policy is to permit up to 20 percent of CDBG expenditures for administration and planning activities, as allowed under CDBG regulations. Also, federal regulations currently allow cities to set aside up to 10 percent of the CDBG grant funds as contingency for cost overruns.

 * In the event that projected revenues differ from actual revenues, the CDBG Administrator will work with affected City departments to implement the policies and strategies stated in this Plan. At the earliest possible opportunity, prior to submittal of the revised Table of Proposed Projects to the Council, the CDBG Administrator will present recommendations to the Mayor and City Council on how to meet the actual revenues following the substantial amendment public process rules. Mayor and Council decisions will then be incorporated into a revised annual Table of Proposed Projects submitted to HUD.

 * In order to meet HUD's timely expenditure requirements and to ensure funds are expended in a deliberate and efficient process, the CDBG Administrator shall, no later than April 1 of each year, review CDBG allocations made to all entities. The CDBG Administrator, in consultation with the affected City departments as well as the Executive department overseeing these entities, will evaluate the recapture of CDBG funds under the following conditions:

 1. Unexpended CDBG funds allocated to human services, planning, administration, and City's internal staffing and operating costs shall be recaptured at the end of City's fiscal year;

 2. Unexpended CDBG funds allocated to various technical and project assistance activities including those supporting the operations of non-profit developers carrying out economic development and low- income housing development activities, shall be recaptured at the end of a one-year contractual cycle;

 3. Unexpended CDBG funds allocated to physical development activities including Low-Income Housing, Community Facilities, Parks Upgrades, Equity Investment, and Facade Improvement shall be recaptured at the end of three years from the date of award notice or funding reservation letter from the City, unless these funds are encumbered by authorized and executed contracts, or unless substantial expenditure and progress on the project are documented, including substantial completion of design in the case of capital projects;

 4. Funds not otherwise covered under #1, 2 and 3 above that are not awarded or encumbered after three years shall be recaptured at the end of the City's fiscal year.

 * Recaptured funds will be used in accordance with the guidelines contained in this Appendix A.

 Should CDBG revenues exceed the planned amount, the additional resources shall be allocated in accordance with these funding guidelines. The unplanned resources may also be used to:

 1) Mitigate the funding reductions currently applied to various CDBG programs, grant administration, and planning efforts;

 2) Provide a comparable funding increase to the aforementioned program areas to the extent possible;

 3) Increase funding for those physical development programs that leverage non-City revenues or that do not require on-going annual funding. To the extent possible, the City shall avoid development of a CDBG operating expense base that cannot be sustained if the federal government fails to maintain future CDBG funding at the current levels.

 Should CDBG revenues come in lower than planned, the City will continue its policy that the priority for managing decreases in CDBG resources will, to the extent possible, be to reduce funding allocations in physical development and/or administrative activities and not in public services nor as committed in the Substitute Funding Agreement.

 * The CDBG funding reductions shall be made in planning, administration, and/or physical development programs, including program delivery costs. One-time-only capital projects are most likely to experience reduced allocations of any CDBG revenue decrease. Funding reductions may be applied across-the-board among physical development programs.

 * The City will explore any other possible areas of savings or reductions that have a minimal impact on sustaining current levels of program operations and services. The CDBG Administrator shall work with affected City programs in identifying and capturing prior year CDBG under-expenditures.

 2008 ESG ~~Revenue Estimate and~~Allocation Guidelines

 ESG funds have been used in Seattle to improve the quality of emergency shelters; to support shelter initiatives to expand capacity; and to provide "essential services," non-maintenance, or security personnel to access supportive services to stabilize people in the community. A maximum of 5% of the grant is allocated to the Human Services Department (HSD) for administrative costs, while 95% of the total grant provides support for programs providing services to homeless people. The HSD Community Services Division administers the ESG program.

~~~~The 2007 award was $544,397 and we are building a budget based on that amount for 2008.
