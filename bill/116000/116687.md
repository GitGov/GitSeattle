 ORDINANCE

 AN ORDINANCE related to funding from non-City sources; authorizing City Department Heads and certain Directors governed by SMC Chapter 3.14 to accept certain grants in amounts not to exceed Fifteen Thousand Dollars, to negotiate and execute contracts and agreements in order to receive funding under those grants and make associated expenditures in accordance with the terms of the applicable grants; and creating a new chapter 5.33 in the Seattle Municipal Code.

 WHEREAS, every year, the City of Seattle receives funds from non-City sources in the form of grants that augment the City's adopted budget and help provide important programs and services that benefit Seattle's residents and visitors; and

 WHEREAS, the Department of Finance typically submits to the City Council for its approval a quarterly Grant Acceptance Ordinance that authorizes the heads of certain City departments to accept specified grants and private funds, and to execute, deliver, and perform corresponding agreements; and

 WHEREAS, many grants received are for amounts of less than Fifteen Thousand Dollars and do not require matching funds or an ongoing financial commitment from the City; and

 WHEREAS, many times, such funding allows the City to redirect its General Fund resources to other critical programs and services that might otherwise not be funded at as high a level, particularly during difficult economic times such as those we are currently experiencing; and

 WHEREAS, in an effort to streamline administration and reduce inefficiencies, the Mayor and City Council have determined it would be both cost-effective and prudent to authorize individual heads of City agencies to accept certain grant funding from non-City sources under specified conditions; NOW, THEREFORE,

 BE IT ORDAINED BY THE SEATTLE CITY COUNCIL AS FOLLOWS:
