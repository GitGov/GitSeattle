 MEMORANDUM OF AGREEMENT

 by and between

 THE CITY OF SEATTLE

 SEATTLE DEPARTMENT OF TRANSPORTATION

 and the

 INTERNATIONAL FEDERATION OF PROFESSIONAL AND

 TECHNICAL ENGINEERS, LOCAL 17

 This Memorandum of Agreement is by and between the City of Seattle (hereinafter referred to as the City) and the International Federation of Professional and Technical Engineers, Local 17 (hereinafter referred to as the Union), and consistent with the terms of the Tentative Agreement between the City of Seattle and the Coalition of Unions, dated October 3, 2007.

 Effective upon the execution of this Memorandum of Agreement, except as otherwise noted herein, the parties agree to the following terms in the matter of the Bridge Operator classification series located in the Capital Projects and Roadway Structures Division of Seattle Department of Transportation (hereinafter referred to SDOT).

 It is understood and agreed by and between the City and the Union that:

 1. SDOT management will conduct observations and job related performance testing with the intent to identify any safety related concerns for individuals in the Bridge Operator classification series and/or the public.

 2. A long standing practice that allowed journey- level Bridge Operators working the day shift to be paid out-of-class as a Senior Bridge Operator, when senior level maintenance work is not actually performed, will end. Consistent with Article 11.1.A of the labor agreement, whenever a Bridge Operator is assigned by management to perform the normal ongoing duties of a Senior Bridge Operator for a period of four (4) consecutive hours or longer, they shall be compensated at the Senior Bridge Operator rate of pay while performing such duties.

 3. SDOT will establish procedures that would require Bridge Operators to telephone in at pre-determined set times. In addition, employees in the classification series will be required to wear an emergency pager during work hours, so that if they are performing repairs or an inspection outside of the tower and an emergency occurs, employees will be better able to call for immediate assistance.

 4. Effective January 6, 2010 the City agrees to adjust the wages for the job titles Bridge Operator, Bridge Operator Senior and Bridge Operations Crew Chief by 5%.

 The effective rates are listed below.
