 WHEREAS, the City Council adopted a new chapter to Title 5 of the Seattle Municipal Code, Chapter 5.37, imposing an employee hours tax on Seattle businesses effective as of July 1, 2007, in order to provide partial funding for a set of transportation improvements, more commonly known as the "Bridging the Gap" program; and

 WHEREAS, the City wants to coordinate the small business threshold dollar amount for the employee hours tax under SMC 5.37.050A1 with the small business threshold dollar amount for the business and occupation gross receipts tax under SMC 5.55.040D; and

 WHEREAS, the SMC includes an unintended, duplicate tax provision for sole proprietors, partnerships, and other small businesses; and

 WHEREAS, technical corrections to the Seattle Municipal Code are necessary to clarify the calculations of the tax and the application of Article XI of the Charter of the City of Seattle; NOW, THEREFORE,

 BE IT ORDAINED BY THE CITY OF SEATTLE AS FOLLOWS:

 Section 1. Section 5.37.020 of the Seattle Municipal Code is amended as follows:

 5.37.020 Definitions.

 The definitions contained in Chapter 5.30 of the Seattle Municipal Code shall be fully applicable to this chapter except as may be expressly stated to the contrary herein. The following additional definitions shall apply throughout this Chapter:

A. "Business" means any person engaging in business as defined in SMC 5.30.030.

 B. "Employee" means any person who performs work, labor, or services for a business, and is on the business' payroll, and who performs any part of their duties within the ~~C~~city of Seattle. For purposes of this chapter, the term "employee" also includes all full-time, part-time, and temporary employees or workers on the business' payroll. A business' payroll includes the payroll of any related company that acts as a paymaster for the related entities. ~~A sole proprietor or partner shall not be considered to be an employee.~~

 C. "Full-time employee" means an employee who works at least one thousand nine hundred twenty (1,920) hours in a calendar year.

 D. "Part-time employee" means an employee who works less than one thousand nine hundred twenty (1,920) hours in a calendar year.

E. "Payroll" means the regular remuneration by a business to the individuals who perform work, labor, services, or make other similar contributions for the business. Payroll includes, but is not limited to, salaries, wages, or other draws or distributions made to employees, officers, partners, or members of Limited Liability Companies and Professional Limited Liability Companies as compensation for their labor and services.

 Section 2. Section 5.37.030 of the Seattle Municipal Code is amended as follows:

 5.37.030 Tax Imposed-Measure of the Tax.

 A. An employee hours tax is hereby levied upon and shall be collected from every person for the act or privilege of engaging in business activities within the ~~C~~city. The tax shall be measured by the number of employee hours of work conducted within the ~~C~~city during the calendar year, except that for the year 2007, the tax shall be measured by the number of employee hours of work conducted within the ~~C~~city during the period July 1, 2007, through December 31, 2007.

 B. The amount of the tax shall be equal to the employee hours worked within the ~~C~~city during the calendar year multiplied by the rate of $0.01302, except that for the year 2007, the amount of the tax shall be equal to the employee hours worked within the ~~C~~city during the period July 1, 2007, through December 31, 2007, multiplied by the rate of $0.01302. The employee hours worked excludes vacation and sick leave hours. If an employee works within and outside the ~~C~~city, it will be the responsibility of the business to calculate and report the number of hours worked within the ~~C~~city.

 C. Alternative Full-Time Equivalent (FTE) Calculation Method. A business may choose to calculate its annual employee hours tax based on the number of its FTE employees as follows:

 1. Calculation of FTEs Post-2007. For all periods following December 31, 2007, the number of FTE employees is (i) the number of a business' full-time employees for the calendar year, plus (ii) the sum of the hours worked by part-time employees in the calendar year divided by 1,920 hours.

 2. Calculation of FTEs for 2007. For the year 2007, the number of FTE employees is (i) the number of a business' employees who work at least nine hundred sixty (960) hours during the period July 1, 2007, through December 31, 2007, plus (ii) the sum of the hours worked by all other employees divided by 960 hours.

 3. Tax. Any fractional FTE remaining after the determination of FTE employees under SMC 5.37.030C1 and 5.37.030C2 shall be rounded up to the nearest whole number. Once the number of FTE employees is thus determined, that number shall be multiplied by $25 to determine the annual employee hours tax, except for 2007 the rate will be $12.50. Once the FTE alternative method is used, it must be used for all future reporting periods, unless a change is approved by the Director.

 D. Businesses with more than one place of business must use the same method of calculation for all places of business.

 E. The tax applies to employee hours worked or FTEs inside the ~~C~~city regardless of whether the place of business is located within or outside of the ~~C~~city.

 F. Temporary employment agencies that supply temporary employees to businesses engaging in business activities within the ~~C~~city, and pay the temporary employee's salary, shall report and pay the tax on all such temporary employees. Businesses engaging temporary employees who are on the business' payroll shall report and pay the tax on the employee hours of such temporary employees, whether or not they are from an employment agency.

 G. All businesses reporting an employee hours tax ~~due~~imposed under SMC 5.37.~~040~~030 shall be entitled to a credit of up to $50.00 from the amount of the tax due. No credit shall be more than the amount of tax owed for each year.

 Section 3. Section 5.37.050 of the Seattle Municipal Code is amended as follows:

 5.37.050 Exemptions and deductions from the employee hour tax.

 A. The following are exempt from the employee hours tax:

 1. Any business having annual worldwide gross income of $~~5~~80,000 or less.

 2. Businesses that are preempted from taxation by cities pursuant to federal or state statutes or regulations, including, but not limited to, the following:

 4. Volunteers and persons providing services in return for only aid or sustenance from religious or charitable organizations.

 B. Non Single-Occupancy-Vehicle Deduction. When computing the number of employees or employee hours, a business may deduct the number of employees, or their hours, for those employees who ~~do not regularly commute to a workplace in the City using a motor vehicle occupied by a single person~~use alternatives to driving alone as their regular commute mode of transportation. The Director shall adopt rules to define eligibility for this non single-occupancy-vehicle deduction.

 Section 4. Section 5.37.070 of the Seattle Municipal Code is amended as follows:

 5.37.070 Use of Revenues.

 The proceeds of the employee hours tax, ~~imposed herein~~less 10 percent, which under the City Charter must be deposited in the Park and Recreation Fund, and any interest or other earnings ~~from their deposit or investment~~placed in and segregated within the Transportation Fund in accordance with SMC 5.37.080, shall be used for transportation purposes. None of the proceeds of the tax imposed herein shall be used to fund the major repair or replacement, including but not limited to replacement with a waterfront tunnel, of the Alaskan Way Viaduct or the seawall located to the west of Alaskan Way, unless appropriated for those purposes by ordinance. To the extent permitted by applicable law the City may issue bonds, notes, or other evidences of indebtedness payable wholly or in part from the additional taxes authorized under this ordinance, and may pledge and may apply such taxes to the payment of principal of, interest on, and premium (if any) on such bonds, notes, or other evidences of indebtedness and to the payment of costs associated with them.

 Section 5. Section 5.37.080 of the Seattle Municipal Code is amended as follows:

The~~se receipts~~proceeds placed in and segregated within the Transportation Fund may be temporarily deposited or invested in such manner as may be lawful for the investment of City money.~~and~~Any interest and other earnings from the deposit or investment of employee hours tax proceeds placed in and segregated within the Transportation Fund shall also be ~~deposited~~placed in and segregated within~~in~~the Transportation Fund.

 Section 6. This ordinance shall take effect and be in force thirty (30) days from and after its approval by the Mayor, but if not approved and returned by the Mayor within ten (10) days after presentation, it shall take effect as provided by Municipal Code Section 1.04.020.
