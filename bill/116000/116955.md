 ORDINANCE _________________

 AN ORDINANCE relating to the redevelopment of the Lake Union Armory Building; amending the Armory Project Development Agreement between The City of Seattle and the Museum of History and Industry ("MOHAI"); accepting an offer from the Washington State Department of Transportation to acquire the MOHAI facility and ancillary improvements at McCurdy Park; authorizing the Superintendent of Parks and Recreation to execute a deed for such improvements and to take other related actions; creating a new budget control level and increasing appropriations in connection therewith; and superseding the requirements of Ordinance 118477 to the extent necessary to carry out the purposes of this ordinance; all by a three-fourths vote of the City Council.

 WHEREAS, the Washington State Department of Transportation ("WSDOT") notified the City that the SR 520 bridge replacement project requires the demolition of certain facilities in McCurdy Park that MOHAI constructed and has used for more than 50 years to operate its regional history museum (the "MOHAI Facilities"); and

 WHEREAS, pursuant to Ordinance 123132, the City and MOHAI entered into a Project Development Agreement ("Agreement") allowing MOHAI to develop and use the Lake Union Armory building ("Armory") for a new regional history museum and authorizing MOHAI to negotiate with WSDOT for the value of the MOHAI Facilities; and

 WHEREAS, the City has agreed to pay those proceeds to MOHAI to use for capital purposes associated with replacing the functions and facilities at its Montlake location, including but not limited to the Armory project; and

 WHEREAS, now the scope and nature of the City property interests that WSDOT is likely to acquire for its SR 520 project have changed as the project has evolved, and the City and MOHAI desire to clarify allocation of the proceeds that the City may eventually receive from WSDOT for certain McCurdy Park property interests; and

 WHEREAS, the Agreement also includes a detailed timeline for MOHAI's satisfaction of certain preconditions for taking control of the Armory that needs to be adjusted to accommodate the needs of both parties for an orderly transition; and

 WHEREAS, Ordinance 123132 also authorized execution of a lease of the Armory location to MOHAI provided certain conditions are met, which lease contains provisions relating to future Armory operating support that need to be adjusted; and

 WHEREAS, WSDOT has presented an offer to acquire the MOHAI Facilities that MOHAI recommends accepting and as the Agreement requires, the Mayor has reviewed and consented to the City's accepting this offer; and

 WHEREAS, City Council authorization is also required to accept the WSDOT offer and to convey title to the MOHAI Facilities; and

 WHEREAS, the City desires that the MOHAI Facilities remain open and usable for park and recreation purposes for as long as possible and to that end desires that the Superintendent of Parks and Recreation negotiate and enter into short-term agreements with WSDOT and MOHAI delineating the rights of the parties with respect to interim use of the MOHAI Facilities; NOW, THEREFORE,

 The Subject Property is more particularly described in Exhibit A and does not include the Land referenced above on which the Subject Property is located.

 RECITALS

 A. WSDOT needs to acquire the Subject Property, including any after acquired interest therein located upon the Land for the SR 520 Bridge Replacement and HOV project.

 B. The CITY and MOHAI are entitled to just compensation for the acquisition of the Subject Property.

 C. The CITY and MOHAI executed an Agreement Regarding Assignment of Acquisition/Condemnation Proceeds on June 16, 2009, (the "CITY/MOHAI Agreement"), regarding WSDOT's impending acquisition/condemnation of the Subject Property. Included in the CITY/MOHAI Agreement is the provision that the Seattle City Council, by ordinance, must approve of any settlement and transfer to WSDOT of the Subject Property.

 D. After WSDOT and MOHAI engaged independent appraisers to value the Subject Property, WSDOT and MOHAI exchanged appraisals and have negotiated an agreed upon figure of value for the acquisition of the Subject Property.

 AGREEMENT

 NOW, THEREFORE, WSDOT, CITY, and MOHAI agree as follows:

 1.  Settlement Amount . The Parties agree to the amount of Forty Million Dollars ($40,000,000) in full and final settlement of WSDOT's taking and/or damaging of the Subject Property consisting of the building only located on the Land as more particularly described in Exhibit "A," a copy of which is attached to and made part of this Settlement Agreement. The Subject Property does not include the Museum Personal Property as more particularly described in Exhibit "A", a copy of which is attached to and made a part of this Settlement Agreement or the Land on which the Subject Property is located.

 2.  Payment of Just Compensation; Installment Payments . The sum of $40,000,000 ("Just Compensation") will be paid by WSDOT for the taking or damaging of the Subject Property in two equal payments of $20,000,000 each. The first payment will be made by WSDOT to CITY on August 1, 2010, or as soon as possible after legislation approving this Settlement Agreement has been enacted by the City Council and become effective (the "Closing Date") at the Closing described in Section 3 below, and the second payment will be made by WSDOT to CITY on or before August 1, 2011.

 3.  Form of Payment . WSDOT's acquisition of the Subject Property (the "Closing") shall be held and delivery of all items to be made at the Closing under the terms of this Settlement Agreement shall be made at the offices of K&L Gates LLP in Seattle, Washington, on the Closing Date. Closing shall occur when each of the following conditions has been satisfied: (a) the CITY has executed and delivered a WSDOT Voucher ("Voucher"); (b) CITY, MOHAI, State of Washington, Department of Natural Resources, and The Arboretum Foundation have each executed and delivered quitclaim deeds to the Subject Property in favor of WSDOT, and (c) WSDOT has delivered a warrant payable to CITY or immediately available funds for delivery or disbursement to CITY on the Closing Date in the amount of $20,000,000. All documents shall be deemed delivered on the date that the first payment of $20,000,000 by warrant or immediately available funds has been tendered by WSDOT for delivery or disbursement to the CITY. The provisions of the Voucher have no relevance to the determination of land value for the Land on which the Subject Property is located that will be acquired by WSDOT at a future date. The Parties further acknowledge and agree that nothing in this Settlement Agreement or any other agreement has limited or shall be construed to limit the determination of just compensation for the Land on which the Subject Property is located; provided, however, that WSDOT shall not be required to provide compensation for improvements located in the MOHAI Use Area when it purchases the Land; and provided, further, that the City and MOHAI acknowledge and agree that the State's payment for acquisition of the MOHAI building satisfies all applicable 4(f) and 6(f) obligations, if any, with respect to the MOHAI building.

 4.  Distribution of Payments . The CITY and MOHAI agree that in accordance with the CITY/MOHAI Agreement, WSDOT shall pay the entire sum of $40,000,000 to the CITY for transfer to MOHAI for the acquisition of the Subject Property.

 5.  Fees and Costs . The Parties agree that WSDOT's payment of $40,000,000 on the terms and conditions set forth herein includes all fees and costs, including attorney fees, statutory allowance fees, and appraisal costs incurred by the Parties in connection with the acquisition of the Subject Property. Such payment is intended as just compensation for the taking of the Subject Property only and does not include any relocation assistance payments to which MOHAI may be entitled under federal and state relocation laws, including, but not limited to RCW Chapter 8.26 and implementing rules and regulations.

 6.  Occupancy of Subject Property; Interest . As part of the overall consideration for the Parties' willingness to enter into this Settlement Agreement: (a) CITY does hereby grant WSDOT a non-revocable license to maintain the Subject Property on the Land until the earlier of December 31, 2012, or the date that WSDOT acquires title to the Land; (b) Pursuant to the provisions of Section 8 of this Settlement Agreement, WSDOT agrees to enter into a lease agreement with MOHAI, which lease will confirm the right of MOHAI to remain in occupancy of the Subject Property without charge from the date of execution of this Settlement Agreement until December 31, 2012, or such other period as MOHAI and WSDOT may agree, in consideration that WSDOT shall not be liable for the payment of any interest on the $40,000,000; provided WSDOT makes its payments in a timely manner, and (c) Nothing contained in this Settlement Agreement grants WSDOT any right to use or occupy all or any portion of the Subject Property until after December 31, 2012, or expiration of the WSDOT lease with MOHAI described in Section 8 below, whichever is later, nor any right to use or occupy all or any portion of the Land on which the Subject Property is located until such time as WSDOT purchases the Land.

 7.  Quitclaim Deeds . The CITY and MOHAI each agree that it shall execute a quitclaim deed to the Subject Property described in Exhibit "A" to WSDOT, and the CITY shall execute the Voucher and a W-9 form. The transfer of the Subject Property is made on an "AS IS" condition and except as expressly provided herein, neither CITY nor MOHAI has any obligation to make repairs, replacements, or improvements to the Subject Property. Subject to the limitation set forth in Section 8 below, MOHAI agrees to maintain the interior of the Subject Property in good condition and shall comply with all federal, state and local laws, ordinances, and regulations applicable to its use of the Subject Property as a museum. Subject to the limitation set forth in Section 8 below, CITY agrees to maintain the structural components of the Subject Property in good condition. Neither CITY nor MOHAI shall commit or allow to be committed any waste upon the Subject Property nor allow any public or private nuisance. Neither CITY nor MOHAI makes any representations or warranties whatsoever with respect to the physical condition of the Subject Property, the presence or absence of hazardous substances within the Subject Property or other physical characteristics of the Subject Property or the suitability of the Subject Property for WSDOT's intended purposes. Such Quitclaim Deed shall be expressly subject to the right of MOHAI under the lease with WSDOT described in Section 8 below.

 8.  Continued Occupancy of Subject Property by MOHAI . As part of the consideration for this Settlement Agreement, WSDOT agrees that MOHAI has the right to continued occupancy of the Subject Property for use as a museum for no additional consideration, for a term that expires no earlier than December 31, 2012, or such other period as MOHAI and WSDOT may agree. MOHAI and WSDOT shall enter into a lease agreement which confirms the terms of this Section 8 and contains such additional terms and conditions consistent with this Settlement Agreement as MOHAI and WSDOT may mutually negotiate in good faith regarding WSDOT's interim lease of the Subject Property to MOHAI for continued use as a museum, including without limitation the requirements that: (a) MOHAI maintain its existing commercial liability insurance during the term of such lease which shall name WSDOT as an additional insured; (b) mutual indemnification provisions consistent with Section 9 below; and (c) provisions for the disposition of Museum Personal Property upon expiration of the lease term. MOHAI shall use commercially reasonable efforts to complete its removal of the Museum Personal Property from the Subject Property no later than expiration of the lease term. The Parties understand and agree that due to the unique size and configuration of certain of the artifacts which constitute part of the Museum Personal Property, the removal of the Museum Personal Property may result in damage to the Subject Property. MOHAI shall have the right to remove windows or demolish walls or other portions of the Subject Property to the extent necessary to remove the Museum Personal Property from the Land, but shall have no obligation to repair any damage caused by such removal so long as MOHAI exercised reasonable care in removing the Museum Personal Property. Any Museum Personal Property which has not been removed from the Subject Property within ninety (90) days following expiration of the lease term shall, unless the Parties agree otherwise, be deemed to have been abandoned by MOHAI and may thereafter be sold or disposed of by WSDOT in its discretion and without cost to MOHAI or the CITY. Since WSDOT intends to demolish the Subject Property upon expiration of the lease term, none of the Parties to this Settlement Agreement shall have any obligation to repair or restore the Subject Property in the event of any damage or destruction thereto.
