For purposes of these land use fees, low-income housing is housing that both (1) satisfies the definition of "low-income housing" in SMC 23.84.024; and (2) where at least fifty percent of the total gross floor area of each structure on the site is committed to low-income housing use for at least 20 years. 2. The single variance fee shall be applicable whether the project requires one or multiple variances. 3. Includes short subdivisions in environmentally critical areas. 4. Includes unit-lot full subdivisions and full subdivisions in environmentally critical areas. 5. This fee applies when design review is initiated only for tree protection and the application has no other review under Items 1-14. 6. The minimum fee is applied to the cost to fabricate, install and remove the environmental review sign. If the sign is removed or defaced before the final City decision, the applicant will be responsible for paying the vendor contracted with the City to repair or replace the sign. 7. The fees for interpretations of SMC Chapters 25.12, 25.20, 25.22, and 25.24 shall be collected by the Director of the Department of Neighborhoods. 8. Additional notice may be given in circumstances including but not limited to the following: reinstallation of environmental review signs, reposting of the land use review or environmental signs, new component reviews added subsequent to the original notice, revised decisions, and changes to the scope of the project. 9. ~~This fee shall be applied towards the permit application fee if an application for a permit is made within 6 months of the date of the pre-application conference and if the project is identified by address at the time of the pre-application conference.~~ The pre-application conference fee covers a one hour conference. Additional pre-application review time will be charged at the hourly rate. See also Section 22.900C.010.E. 10. Recording fees will be charged the current rate as established and charged by King County at the time of document recording. * * * Section 2. Effective January 1, 2010, or on the effective date of this ordinance, if after January 1, 2010, Section 22.900D.010 of the Seattle Municipal Code, which Section was last amended by Ordinance 122855, is amended as follows: 22.900D.010 Development permit fees. *** E. Calculation of Development Fees. The development fee for a permit shall be calculated as described in this section. Table D-1 establishes the development fee index for value-based development fees. Except as specified in Section 22.900D.010 F below, Table D-2 establishes the permit fee and plan review fee, calculated as a percentage of the development fee index where determined by value. If two or more buildings are allowed under one permit, they shall be assessed fees as separate buildings under Table D-2. The individual fees shall then be added to determine the total development fee for the permit.
