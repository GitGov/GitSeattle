 Section 4. A new Section 4.36.196 is added to the Seattle Municipal Code as follows:

4.36.196 Special option for purchase of creditable service by employees of the Seattle Firefighter's Pension Fund hired prior to January 1, 2007.

A. An officer or employee of the Seattle Firefighter's Pension Fund who was hired as an employee or officer thereof on or before the effective date of this Ordinance and who thereafter becomes and continues his or her service as an employee of the City may elect to join the City's retirement system and contract to purchase credit for prior service performed for the Seattle Firefighter's Pension Board by completing and filing an election form with the Board, and paying the purchase price, as determined by the Board, into the retirement fund on or before thirty days after the effective date of this ordinance. The creditable service may be purchased based on the following price formula:  (hourly rate) x (current member contribution rate (8.03% x (amount of hours to be purchased) x (interest factor as calculated below).

 Creditable service shall be based on the employee's or officer's actual hours and salary in the period of time going back no more that 10 years from the effective date of this ordinance. The interest factor applied to the purchase price will be determined by approximating the net investment returns of the retirement fund that occurred during the period of time that relates to the buyback, with a minimum interest factor no less than the actuarially assumed rate of investment return for the same periods. The purchase price shall be calculated using an annualized interest rate, compounded bi- weekly. Notwithstanding the above purchase price interest factor, the amount credited to the individual member accounts will be calculated by applying an interest rate 5.75% to approximate what the creditable amount would have been had the individual been a contributing member of the retirement system all along. Only the amount credited to the individual member accounts will be included in any benefit calculation or any future withdrawal.

B. An officer or employee subject to this section who fails to exercise his or her option under this subsection on or before thirty days after the effective date of this ordinance, may not thereafter purchase such credit provided, however, that nothing in this section shall affect such an officer or employee's right to elect to join the retirement system or to purchase creditable service earned subsequent to the effective date of this ordinance or at any time thereafter in the manner provided under Section 4.36.100 F of the Seattle Municipal Code.

C. The Seattle Firefighter's Pension Fund shall pay into the retirement fund the matching amount equivalent to any member lump sum payment made pursuant to this Section.

 Section 5. Any acts consistent with the authority and prior to the effective date of this ordinance are hereby ratified and confirmed.

 Section 6. This ordinance shall take effect and be in force thirty (30) days from and after its approval by the Mayor, but if not approved and returned by the Mayor within ten (10) days after presentation, it shall take effect as provided by Municipal Code Section 1.04.020.
