 AN ORDINANCE authorizing acceptance of donations from public and private sources in support of South Lake Union Urban Center planning efforts, and increasing appropriation authority in the 2008 Adopted Budget contingent upon receipt of said donations.

 WHEREAS, in recognition of the designation of South Lake Union as an Urban Center and in order to implement the South Lake Union Urban Center Neighborhood Plan's intent to stimulate housing and supportive development in a vibrant and livable neighborhood in South Lake Union, the Department of Planning and Development has undertaken an area-wide planning and zoning study; and

 WHEREAS, the Department of Planning and Development in carrying out area-wide planning and zoning studies, must perform analysis of growth and development patterns; evaluate the environmental impacts of new development; and evaluate the influence of City regulations and policies on the development of housing and jobs; and

 WHEREAS, funding to complete a thorough and meaningful analysis of zoning alternatives and development scenarios in order to guide the assessment of environmental impacts and policy decisions is often inadequate due to a lack of departmental resources with competing demands; and

 WHEREAS, local stakeholders have expressed interest in providing funding to assist the City in preparing an Environmental Impact Statement (EIS) that analyzes proposals for rezoning and changes to land use controls in the South Lake Union Urban Center; including transportation impact analysis, economic and urban design assessments, and analysis of development trends and alternative development or zoning scenarios; and

 WHEREAS, the Department of Planning and Development will take steps, including forestalling solicitation, acceptance, or expenditure of donated funds until EIS and zoning alternatives have been established, to ensure that funding from private sources does not compromise the independence or objectivity of the analyses, or the City's role in the conduct, direction, or outcome of the South Lake Union Zoning Study and EIS; and

 WHEREAS, the Department of Planning and Development will provide equal access to findings and conclusions in the South Lake Union Zoning Study and EIS to all community partners, including the South Lake Union Friends and Neighbors Community Council (SLUFAN), the South Lake Union Chamber of Commerce and the Cascade Neighborhood Council (CNC); and

 WHEREAS, the City Council finds that if steps are taken to ensure that contributors of funding will not exercise undue influence over the outcome of the South Lake Union Zoning Study or EIS, then funding from public and private sources may be accepted by the Department of Planning and Development. NOW, THEREFORE,

 BE IT ORDAINED BY THE CITY OF SEATTLE AS FOLLOWS:
