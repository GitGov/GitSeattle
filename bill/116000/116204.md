 ORDINANCE _________________

 AN ORDINANCE relating to noise control, amending various sections and adding new sections to Chapter 25.08 of the Seattle Municipal Code, to provide for a major public project construction variance for major public construction projects, to update various provisions to conform to new technology and changes in technology, to revise the enforcement procedures to provide for stop work orders, revocation of variances, citations and civil penalties, to revise various provisions to update and clarify references and correct grammar and other errors, and repealing Sections 25.08.130, 25.08.240, 25.08.535, 25.08.620, 25.08.750, 25.08.770, 25.08.780, 25.08.790 and 25.08.810.

 WHEREAS, it is the policy of the City of Seattle to minimize the exposure of citizens to the physiological and psychological dangers of excessive noise and to protect, promote and preserve the public health, safety and welfare; and

 WHEREAS, it is the express intent of the City to control the level of noise in a manner that promotes commerce; the use, value and enjoyment of property; sleep and repose; and the quality of the environment; and

 WHEREAS, construction of major public infrastructure projects may result in noise impacts to adjacent business and residential properties oftentimes along linear corridors and of substantial duration; and

 WHEREAS, several such major public infrastructure projects are either underway or are proposed for construction in the near future, including Sound Transit's Link Light Rail and the Alaskan Way Viaduct and Seawall Replacement Project; and

 WHEREAS, the noise code does not clearly identify a process for qualifying for and obtaining construction noise variances for major, public, more than six-month construction projects; and

 WHEREAS, the ability to work during nighttime hours is often essential to complete such projects on a timely and financially feasible schedule; and

 WHEREAS, the proposed changes in the noise ordinance do not increase the exterior sound levels allowed during construction from what is allowed in the current ordinance, while providing for a variance from these levels for major public construction projects; and

 WHEREAS, the noise ordinance has not been amended in recent years to reflect technological changes in how to measure noise impacts, changes in other codes and ordinances, or to make grammar changes; NOW, THEREFORE,

 BE IT ORDAINED BY THE CITY OF SEATTLE AS FOLLOWS:

A major public project construction variance shall provide relief from the exterior sound level limits during the construction or reconstruction of a major public project only to the extent the applicant demonstrates that compliance with the levels would:

 1. Be unreasonable in light of public or worker safety or cause the applicant to violate other applicable regulations, including but not limited to regulations that reduce impacts on transportation infrastructure or natural resources; or
