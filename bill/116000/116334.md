 AN ORDINANCE relating to the City Light Department; authorizing the acquisition of real property located in the North Downtown area of Seattle and legally described as Lots 17, 18 and 19, all in Block 13, Pontius Fourth Addition to the City of Seattle, according to the plat thereof recorded in Volume 7 of Plats, Page 8, Records of King County, Washington, for electric system purposes.

 WHEREAS, in Ordinance 122537 the City determined that it is necessary for the City Light Department to construct and operate a new electrical substation; and

 WHEREAS, Ordinance 122537 authorized the Superintendent of the City Light Department to acquire property for the construction and operation of a new substation, including a parcel commonly described as 1250 Denny Way, Seattle, King County, Washington ("Parcel 1"), that is owned by Greyhound Lines, Inc. ("Greyhound") and used as a bus maintenance facility; and

 WHEREAS, Greyhound also owns real property, commonly described as 145 Yale Avenue North, Seattle, King County, Washington and legally described below ("Parcel 2"), that is used as a parking lot for employees working at the maintenance facility; and

 WHEREAS, Greyhound has determined that Parcel 2 will not be of use or benefit to Greyhound if it sells Parcel 1 and, therefore, Greyhound is willing to sell Parcel 1 to the City only if the City also purchases Parcel 2; and

 WHEREAS, the City Light Department has determined that Parcel 2 will be useful to the City for staging purposes during the construction of the substation; and

 WHEREAS, the Seattle City Council approved a budget proviso in the 2008 Adopted Budget (Green Sheet #5-1-A-2) imposing a proviso on expenditures for design work related to the North Downtown-South Lake Union substation, but did not restrict expenditures for the purchase of property for a substation, or for work in support of that purchase; NOW, THEREFORE,

 provided, however, that the total purchase price for both Parcel 1 and Parcel 2 shall not exceed the amount appropriated under Ordinance 122560 for the North Downtown Substation Development (Project #7757).

 Section 2. The Superintendent or his designee is further authorized to enter into such other agreements and take such actions as are reasonably necessary to complete the purchase of Parcel 2 and to accept and record deeds therefor.
