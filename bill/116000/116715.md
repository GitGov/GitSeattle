 AN ORDINANCE relating to land use and zoning and the six year MUP expiration, reconciling conflicts in the amendments made to the same section of the Seattle Municipal Code (23.76.032) by both Ordinance 123034 and Ordinance 123072, by repealing Ordinance 123072, amending Section 23.76.032 as amended by Ordinance 123034 to reflect the amendments intended by Ordinance 123072, and ratifying any actions taken pursuant to Ordinance 123072.

 WHEREAS the Council passed amendments to Section 23.76.032 of the Seattle Municipal Code in Ordinance 123072 without taking into consideration that Council had previously passed amendments to Section 23.76.032 in Ordinance 123034 that had not yet taken effect at the time Council passed Ordinance 123072; and

 WHEREAS the amendments to Section 23.76.032 of the Seattle Municipal Code passed by Ordinances 123034 and 123072 are inconsistent and cannot be reconciled as passed by Council; and

 WHEREAS Council desires to repeal Ordinance 123072 and the amendments to Section 23.76.032 made by Ordinance 123072 solely in order to reenact the ordinance and the amendments in a way that is consistent with the amendments to Section 23.76.032 previously made by Ordinance 123034; NOW THEREFORE
