 AN ORDINANCE accepting funds from the Washington State Department of Commerce allocated through the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009; authorizing the Mayor or his designee to execute related agreements; amending the 2009 Adopted Budget to increase appropriations for the Department of Parks and Recreation; and ratifying and confirming certain prior acts; all by a three-fourths vote of the City Council.

 WHEREAS, the United States Congress authorized funding to increase jobs and provide economic stimulus through Community Services Block Grants as part of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (ARRA); and

 WHEREAS, the Seattle Conservation Corps (SCC) is a one-year work experience program for homeless adults and is part of the City of Seattle's Department of Parks and Recreation; and

 WHEREAS, the ARRA grant funding constitutes one-time funding for the SCC to provide new computers, software and internet access to SCC's learning center; increased rent assistance to homeless adults; increased program capacity through the funding of unfilled and unfunded supervisory staff to support an increase in the number of participants after which capital project funding will be sought to maintain the capacity increase; a feasibility study on green jobs; and increased training opportunities for SCC staff and participants in the emerging green jobs arena; and

 WHEREAS, the City is not obligated to continue or maintain ARRA grant funding levels for the SCC once ARRA grant funds have lapsed;
