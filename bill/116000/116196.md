The CITY agrees to assist the STATE to obtain the Street Use Permits in an efficient and expeditious manner, and agrees to implement a coordinated plan review and process for issuance of Street Use Permits, as described in this Article.

 6.11 The Parties agree that the requirements of and conditions applicable to the Street Use Permits issued for City of Seattle Street Right-of-Way in connection with the PROJECT will also apply to all portions of the Phase 1 Property used for the PROJECT, and those requirements and conditions are incorporated by reference. The STATE agrees to abide by and comply with all such requirements and conditions and to include all such requirements and conditions in its contracts with contractors.

 6.12 It is the STATE's opinion that City of Seattle land use permits are not required for the PROJECT. The City of Seattle disagrees with the STATE's opinion. However, for this PROJECT, the City of Seattle will not require the STATE to obtain City of Seattle land use permits for the PROJECT. The STATE or its contractors may need to obtain other City of Seattle permits for the PROJECT, such as demolition or side sewer permits issued by the Seattle Department of Planning and Development. Except for the Street Use Permits, the STATE or its contractors shall pay the standard permit review and issuance fees for all permits obtained from the City of Seattle, in accordance with applicable adopted fee ordinances and schedules. For Street Use Permits, the STATE shall pay a Base Permit Fee.

 6.13 The CITY shall organize an interdepartmental City of Seattle team to provide information to the STATE to facilitate preparation of complete Street Use Permit application packages and to provide the coordinated plan review process outlined in this Article.

 6.14 SDOT shall coordinate review of the Street Use Permit applications for the PROJECT through the appropriate City of Seattle departments, after a complete Street Use Permit application package has been submitted to the CITY. The CITY shall also provide a project manager, who will coordinate plan and Street Use Permit application reviews and coordinate issuance of Street Use Permits, including coordinating preapplication reviews, receiving and distributing materials among City of Seattle reviewers, collating and tracking review comments, and resolving conflicting comments or requirements.

 6.15 The STATE shall submit to the CITY clear and complete plans, specifications, and the necessary supplemental information such as field reconnaissance studies and calculations. The STATE shall prepare and timely submit plans to the CITY and provide corrections and additional information as requested by the CITY in a manner that will allow City of Seattle departments sufficient time to review the applications and plans. As the remaining submittals for the PROJECT are limited to the 90% and the 100% plan reviews, the CITY agrees to twenty-five (25) Business Days for review of the 90% submittal and fifteen (15) Business Days for the 100% submittal. However, the number of Business Days for review will increase if multiple submittals are received by the City of Seattle per the table below.

 Submittal Phase Number of Business Days per Number of Plan Review Packages Under Review

 One Two Three 30% Progress Review 15 25 25 60% Agency Review 25

 40 45 90% Agency Review 25 40 45 100% Agency Review 15 15 20

 6.16 The City of Seattle review period begins with the receipt by the CITY of the 90% Plan Review Package and for the 100% Plan Review Package, with receipt by the CITY of the 100% Plan Review Package and ends when the City of Seattle's final comment document is submitted to the STATE electronically in a Microsoft Excel document format.

 6.17 The STATE shall hand deliver the 90% and 100% Plan Review Package to the CITY's Designated Representative or other official designated by the CITY for review and comment. For purposes of this Article VI, the Plan Review Package includes the plans, specifications, necessary supplemental information such as field reconnaissance studies and calculations, and corrections previously requested by the CITY. The STATE shall submit to the City of Seattle 35 half-scale (11 inch by 17 inch) copies of the 90% Plan Review Package and 6 half-scale (11 inch by 17 inch) copies of the 100% Plan Review Package.

 6.18 The STATE agrees to establish and provide to the CITY a target schedule for the STATE's submittal to the CITY of the Plan Review Package as soon as such schedule is available. The STATE shall notify the CITY of any proposed schedule modifications. If the STATE determines that it cannot meet the anticipated dates, the STATE shall provide to the CITY's Designated Representative a revised submittal schedule as soon as possible after delay is known or anticipated.

 6.19 The STATE shall notify the CITY's Designated Representative fifteen (15) Business Days prior to the scheduled 90% Plan Review Package to confirm that the Plan Review Package will be transmitted as scheduled or to establish a deferred date so that CITY staff can be appropriately scheduled for the 90% review.

 6.20 The CITY's Designated Representative will work with the City of Seattle departments to identify deficiencies in the STATE's 90% Plan Review Package. City of Seattle reviewers will describe the deficiencies in writing in sufficient detail to enable the STATE to revise the plans in a manner that brings them into compliance with City of Seattle requirements. All comments from City of Seattle reviewers will be incorporated into one Microsoft Excel document. The CITY's Designated Representative, or other official designated by the CITY, will reconcile and resolve conflicting comments from the City of Seattle reviewers prior to submitting formal comments to the STATE within the agreed timeframe.

 6.21 The STATE shall provide a written response to the CITY for every written comment submitted by the City of Seattle.

 6.22 The STATE shall work with CITY staff to resolve all issues and address every City of Seattle comment on the 90% Plan Review Package through one-on-one meetings with CITY staff and additional plan sheet revisions. If such meetings and revisions do not resolve all City of Seattle issues within 30 calendar days, the remaining issues will be considered a dispute and resolved in accordance with Article XV - Dispute Resolution.

 6.23 Both the CITY and STATE shall work collaboratively to resolve issues in a timely manner prior to the STATE delivering the 100% Plan Review Package to the CITY for approval. Once the STATE has demonstrated that all the City of Seattle's 90% Plan Review Package review comments have been addressed to the CITY's satisfaction, the CITY shall provide the STATE with a written request to submit the 100% Plan Review Package for final review and plan approval.

 6.24 The CITY will coordinate a final check of the 100% Plan Review Package to confirm that the 100% Plan Review Package adequately addresses the City of Seattle comments and complies with CITY technical and street use regulatory requirements. Upon such confirmation, the CITY will issue to the STATE a Letter of Plan Approval signifying the City of Seattle's approval of the design. Said Letter of Plan Approval does not authorize construction, does not constitute approval of the City of Seattle in any regulatory capacity, and is not an assurance that the plans comply with applicable laws, regulations, ordinances or codes. Nor shall the Letter of Plan Approval be construed to authorize any failure to comply with any of the foregoing.

 6.25 After the Letter of Plan Approval has been issued, and after the STATE has fulfilled the requirements for Street Use Permits issuance of this Phase I SDOT MOA and the minimum requirements of the Seattle Municipal Code Title 15 for the issuance of a Street Use Permit, SDOT will, within five Business Days, issue to the STATE Street Use Permits authorizing construction of the PROJECT.

 6.26 The STATE shall make or implement no revisions or deviations from the Approved Plans without first obtaining the review and concurrence of the CITY.

 The following work will be completed in accordance with the Approved Plans and Street Use Permits.

 1. Relocate five 13.8kV network distribution feeders (the Five Massachusetts Feeders) from the AWV to newly-constructed duct bank from the South Massachusetts substation to a point near Railroad Way South ramps. At the ramps, they will transition to an overhead configuration attached to the structure until bent 120 where they will be spliced into the existing distribution feeders. Ethylene propylene rubber (EPR) jacketed type cable will be used. The distribution duct back will begin at the substation on Colorado Avenue South and be placed northward generally parallel to the AWV. A permanent splice vault will be provided in the vicinity of the north end of the portion of the WOSCA property (see legal description in Exhibit A) owned by the STATE to facilitate the completion of the 13.8 kV network distribution feeder relocations under future project phases.

 2. Relocate two 115kV transmission lines, MA-US -1 and MA-US-2 from the AWV to a newly constructed duct bank from the South Massachusetts substation to a point near the intersection of Railroad Way South and the existing AWV. Solid dielectric cross-linked polyethylene (XLPE) cable for underground installation will be used. The new XLPE cables will be transitioned and spliced back to the existing 620kcmil aluminum self-contained fluid filled (SCFF) cables, currently attached to the AWV structure, between bents 119 and 118. The transmission duct back will begin at the substation on Colorado Avenue South and be placed northward generally parallel to the AWV. A permanent splice vault will be placed in the vicinity of the north end of the portion of the WOSCA property owned by WSDOT to facilitate future relocation of the portions of the transmission circuits that remain on the Viaduct north of Railroad Way South.

 3. It is understood that the PROJECT is only the first phase of a comprehensive electrical line relocation solution . The STATE remains committed to finding an acceptable design solution for subsequent phases of work to complete the relocation of the Five Massachusetts Feeders and the MA-US-1 and MA-US-2 transmission lines in a manner acceptable to SCL and that accommodates the timely removal of the AWV and reconfiguration of SR 99.

 4. Relocate an SPU watermain in South Royal Brougham Way to accommodate installation of the new distribution and transmission duct banks.

 5. Temporary roadway restoration of Colorado Avenue South, South Atlantic Street, South Royal Brougham Way and Alaskan Way.

 6. Temporary traffic control measures and temporary shoring systems necessary to complete the PROJECT.

 WHEREAS, the STATE in consultation with the City of Seattle is planning for the replacement of the Alaskan Way Viaduct ("AWV") on State Route 99, a non-limited access highway, located partially in the City of Seattle; and

 WHEREAS, in order to provide a transportation facility and seawall with improved earthquake resistance that maintains or improves mobility and accessibility for people and goods, the State and City of Seattle will implement improvement projects that remove the AWV, reconfigure State Route 99 and replace the Seawall. All of these projects are collectively referred to as the PROGRAM. The State and City of Seattle, in conjunction with the Federal Highway Administration (FHWA), and King County, are working to define a reconfigured and improved State Route 99; and

 WHEREAS, the Parties are moving forward collaboratively with King County to determine what the solution will be in the Central Waterfront portion of the PROGRAM, but have agreed in general, on the work required at the north and south ends of the PROGRAM. As directed by the Governor and the Mayor of Seattle, the State, in consultation with the City, is preparing to design and construct certain Early Safety and Mobility Projects at the north and south ends. These projects significantly advance the PROGRAM; and

 WHEREAS, the AWV structure is aging and was further weakened by the Nisqually Earthquake in 2001, and because of these factors, it is vulnerable to catastrophic damage during another seismic event; and

 WHEREAS, Seattle City Light has five (5) 13.8kV network express feeders and two (2) self-contained, low pressure oil-filled 115kV transmission cables (collectively, "Utilities") located on the AWV structure and the Utilities are also vulnerable to damage during a seismic event; and

 WHEREAS, removal of the AWV structure will require the prior relocation of the Utilities, regardless of whether the AWV is reconstructed with an elevated structure or replaced with a tunnel or surface option; and

 WHEREAS, one of the Early Safety and Mobility Projects is the relocation of all Seattle City Light electrical lines off of the AWV. Phase I of this Early Safety and Mobility Project is the relocation of electrical lines between South Massachusetts Street and Railroad Way South which is planned to be completed prior to another Early Safety and Mobility Project, the AWV Removal from South Holgate Street to South King Street; and

 WHEREAS, the Parties agree that the STATE will perform the design and construction of the Utility relocation, as well as the procurement of any Utilities relocation materials that are required to meet schedule requirements; and

 WHEREAS, the Parties desire to complete the Utilities relocation prior to December 31, 2009; and

 WHEREAS, concurrently with this Phase I SCL MOA, the STATE and CITY are entering into a Memorandum of Agreement, No. GCA 5680, for Property, Environmental Remediation, Permitting, and Construction Coordination Agreement for Electrical Utility Relocation - Phase I ("Phase I SDOT MOA"); and

 WHEREAS, concurrently with this Phase I SCL MOA, the STATE and CITY, through its Seattle Public Utilities Department, are entering into a Memorandum of Agreement, No. UT01287, for SPU Facilities Work - Phase I ("Phase I SPU MOA");

 Exhibit A: Scope of Work

 The following work will be completed in accordance with the Approved Plans and Street Use Permits.

 1. Relocate five 13.8kV network distribution feeders (the Five Massachusetts Feeders) from the AWV to newly-constructed duct bank from the South Massachusetts substation to a point near Railroad Way South ramps. At the ramps, they will transition to an overhead configuration attached to the structure until bent 120 where they will be spliced into the existing distribution feeders. Ethylene propylene rubber (EPR) jacketed type cable will be used. The distribution duct back will begin at the substation on Colorado Avenue South and be placed northward generally parallel to the AWV. A permanent splice vault will be provided in the vicinity of the north end of the portion of the WOSCA property (see legal description in Exhibit A) owned by the STATE to facilitate the completion of the 13.8 kV network distribution feeder relocations under future project phases.

 2. Relocate two 115kV transmission lines, MA-US -1 and MA-US-2 from the AWV to a newly constructed duct bank from the South Massachusetts substation to a point near the intersection of Railroad Way South and the existing AWV. Solid dielectric cross-linked polyethylene (XLPE) cable for underground installation will be used. The new XLPE cables will be transitioned and spliced back to the existing 620kcmil aluminum self-contained fluid filled (SCFF) cables, currently attached to the AWV structure, between bents 119 and 118. The transmission duct back will begin at the substation on Colorado Avenue South and be placed northward generally parallel to the AWV. A permanent splice vault will be placed in the vicinity of the north end of the portion of the WOSCA property owned by WSDOT to facilitate future relocation of the portions of the transmission circuits that remain on the Viaduct north of Railroad Way South.

 3. It is understood that the PROJECT is only the first phase of a comprehensive electrical line relocation solution. The STATE remains committed to finding an acceptable design solution for subsequent phases of work to complete the relocation of the Five Massachusetts Feeders and the MA-US-1 and MA-US-2 transmission lines in a manner acceptable to SCL and that accommodates the timely removal of the AWV and reconfiguration of SR 99.

 4. Relocate an SPU watermain in South Royal Brougham Way to accommodate installation of the new distribution and transmission duct banks.

 5. Temporary roadway restoration of Colorado Avenue South, South Atlantic Street, South Royal Brougham Way and Alaskan Way.

 6. Temporary traffic control measures and temporary shoring systems necessary to complete the PROJECT.

 7. Remediation of known Hazardous Substances and Hazardous Substances discovered during the course of construction of the PROJECT, within the Phase I Property and the City Street Right of Way within the limits of the PROJECT as shown on the Approved Plans, in accordance with the requirements described in the Phase I SDOT MOA.

Upon written approval by SPU, the STATE shall make changes to the Approved Plans that impact SPU Facilities, and shall make changes to the schedule as necessary to respond to comments provided by SPU. The STATE shall pay for all Change Orders. No delay costs shall be paid by SPU.

 7.2 SPU may request additions and changes to the Water System and/or the Drainage and Wastewater System Work through the STATE. The STATE shall comply with the requested additions provided that the change is within the general scope of the PROJECT and complies with the PROJECT permits, State and/or Federal law and applicable rules, codes and/or regulations. Such additions and changes may lead to Change Orders, or they may lead to Betterments.

 7.3 For purposes of this Phase I SPU MOA, a Betterment is any upgrading of the facility being relocated that is not attributable to the PROJECT or PROGRAM and is made solely for the benefit of and at the election of SPU. SPU shall be responsible for the additional incremental cost of any Betterment. A decision to execute a Betterment shall be made by the mutual agreement of the STATE and SPU. Any Betterments shall require the written request of SPU.

 7.3.1 Examples of work that will not constitute a Betterment, so that SPU shall not bear cost responsibility, are:

 i) If existing devices or materials are no longer regularly manufactured or cannot be obtained in time to meet the PROJECT schedule, needs or requests by the STATE, then devices or materials of equivalent standards although not identical, of the next highest grade or size;

 ii) Upgrades to relocated or replaced utility facilities necessary to meet current code requirements and SPU standards; or

 iii) Work required by SPU to maintain service capability and capacity as the STATE's PROGRAM progresses.

 8. PROTECTION OF SPU FACILITIES ACCESS

 8.1 Neither the STATE nor its Contractor shall require SPU to interrupt water service without (i) written notice to SPU at least fourteen (14) calendar days prior to the planned interruption and (ii) SPU's written approval. SPU may restrict water service interruptions to the extent necessary to maintain Water System operations and adequate water supply to customers. Under no circumstances shall the STATE, its Contractor, or anyone other than SPU personnel, damage, repair, modify or operate any portion of the existing water system including but not limited to water services, water mains, valves, test stations, and meters.

 8.2 The STATE shall ensure that SPU's access to existing and newly installed hydrants, meters, valves, or similar surface Water System Facilities, and Drainage and Wastewater System Facilities, is maintained 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, unless different arrangements have been agreed to in advance and in writing by the Parties. For purposes of this Phase I SPU MOA, "access" shall mean that the hydrants, meters, valves, or similar surface Water System Facilities, and Drainage and Wastewater System Facilities shall not be blocked, covered or otherwise inaccessible to SPU.

 8.3 SPU shall have the right to enter the PROJECT site at any time to operate and maintain the Water System or the Drainage and Wastewater System, to inspect or observe the Water System Work or any Drainage and Wastewater System Work performed by the Contractor, or to perform the Water System Work or any Drainage or Wastewater System Work for which SPU is responsible.

 Exhibit A: Scope of Work

 The following work will be completed in accordance with the Approved Plans and Street Use Permits.

 1. Relocate five 13.8kV network distribution feeders (the Five Massachusetts Feeders) from the AWV to newly-constructed duct bank from the South Massachusetts substation to a point near Railroad Way South ramps. At the ramps, they will transition to an overhead configuration attached to the structure until bent 120 where they will be spliced into the existing distribution feeders. Ethylene propylene rubber (EPR) jacketed type cable will be used. The distribution duct back will begin at the substation on Colorado Avenue South and be placed northward generally parallel to the AWV. A permanent splice vault will be provided in the vicinity of the north end of the portion of the WOSCA property (see legal description in Exhibit A) owned by the STATE to facilitate the completion of the 13.8 kV network distribution feeder relocations under future project phases.

 2. Relocate two 115kV transmission lines, MA-US -1 and MA-US-2 from the AWV to a newly constructed duct bank from the South Massachusetts substation to a point near the intersection of Railroad Way South and the existing AWV. Solid dielectric cross-linked polyethylene (XLPE) cable for underground installation will be used. The new XLPE cables will be transitioned and spliced back to the existing 620kcmil aluminum self-contained fluid filled (SCFF) cables, currently attached to the AWV structure, between bents 119 and 118. The transmission duct back will begin at the substation on Colorado Avenue South and be placed northward generally parallel to the AWV. A permanent splice vault will be placed in the vicinity of the north end of the portion of the WOSCA property owned by WSDOT to facilitate future relocation of the portions of the transmission circuits that remain on the Viaduct north of Railroad Way South.

 3. It is understood that the PROJECT is only the first phase of a comprehensive electrical line relocation solution. The STATE remains committed to finding an acceptable design solution for subsequent phases of work to complete the relocation of the Five Massachusetts Feeders and the MA-US-1 and MA-US-2 transmission lines in a manner acceptable to SCL and that accommodates the timely removal of the AWV and reconfiguration of SR 99.

 4. Relocate an SPU watermain in South Royal Brougham Way to accommodate installation of the new distribution and transmission duct banks.

 5. Temporary roadway restoration of Colorado Avenue South, South Atlantic Street, South Royal Brougham Way and Alaskan Way.

 6. Temporary traffic control measures and temporary shoring systems necessary to complete the PROJECT.

 7. Remediation of known Hazardous Substances and Hazardous Substances discovered during the course of construction of the PROJECT, within the Phase I Property and the City Street Right of Way within the limits of the PROJECT as shown on the Approved Plans, in accordance with the requirements described in the Phase I SDOT MOA.
