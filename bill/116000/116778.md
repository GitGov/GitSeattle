 AN ORDINANCE relating to land use and zoning; amending Section 23.41.010 of the Seattle Municipal Code, approving and adopting revised Neighborhood Design Guidelines for the Northgate Urban Center & Overlay District.

 WHEREAS, neighborhood-specific design guidelines were developed for the Northgate Urban Center and Overlay District to carry out specific design goals identified by the Northgate Comprehensive Plan and adopted by Ordinance 121303 in October 2003; and

 WHEREAS, the City, working with members of the Northgate community, has developed revisions to the Northgate Urban Center & Overlay District Design Guidelines that more fully capture the intended character of the Northgate neighborhood; NOW, THEREFORE,

Neighborhood design guidelines are intended to augment and make more specific the "Guidelines for Multifamily and Commercial Buildings, 1998 (Amended 2006)" and the "Guidelines for Downtown Development, 1999." To the extent there are conflicts between neighborhood design guidelines and the "Guidelines for Multifamily and Commercial Buildings, 1998 (Amended 2006)" or "Guidelines for Downtown Development, 1999", the neighborhood design guidelines prevail.
