 AN ORDINANCE relating to the City Light Department; amending Ordinance 121683 to clarify City Light's authority to enter into multiyear transmission arrangements when required to secure long-term transmission service from PacifiCorp for the purpose of transmitting energy purchased from the Stateline Wind Project.

 WHEREAS, Ordinance 121683 authorized City Light to secure and purchase long-term firm point-to-point transmission from the Wallula substation, the location of the interconnection of the Stateline Wind Project with PacifiCorp's transmission system, to the Mid-Columbia trading hub, including the Wanapum bus in Grant County, for the energy and environmental attributes purchased by City Light in its Stateline Power Purchase Agreement; and

 WHEREAS, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission now requires that long-term transmission rights may only be secured for periods of at least five (5) years; and

 WHEREAS, it is in the interest of the City to authorize, by this ordinance, certain specific revisions to the authority provided to the Superintendent of City Light to secure and enter into long-term transmission arrangements in order to secure and maintain necessary long-term transmission rights for the energy and environmental attributes purchased from the Stateline Wind Project; NOW THEREFORE,

 BE IT ORDAINED BY THE CITY OF SEATTLE AS FOLLOWS:

 Section 1. Sections 1, 3, 4 and 5 of Ordinance 121683 are amended as

 follows:

 Section 1. The Superintendent of the City Light Department, or his designee (the "Superintendent"), is hereby authorized to execute, for and on behalf of the City of Seattle (the "City"), an agreement between the City, PacifiCorp and PPM Energy for assignment of long- term firm point-to-point transmission rights, substantially in the form attached hereto as Exhibit A entitled, "Amendatory Agreement for Assignment of Transmission Rights." The transmission service is purchased from PacifiCorp Transmission ~~on an annual renewal basis~~ and is for long-term firm point-to-point transmission from the Wallula substation, the location of the interconnection of the Stateline Wind Project with PacifiCorp's transmission system, to the Mid-Columbia trading hub to include the Wanapum bus in Grant County. The transmission rights acquired by Exhibit A may be deferred for up to five years by payment of one month's transmission costs.

 Section 3. ~~Except for the obligation to take at least one full year of service, T~~The transmission rights are subject to a~~n annual~~ renewal election by the City for at least a five (5) year term. Accordingly, the Superintendent is authorized to  periodically~~annually~~renew the transmission rights described in Exhibit A, or whatever portion thereof City Light deems prudent in light of the Stateline Power Purchase Agreement.

 Section 4. ~~Despite its right to annually renew such transmission, the City may lose its priority to the transmission rights if another customer of the transmission provider offers to take such transmission on a multiyear basis. If the transmission provider received a multiyear offer, the City would be provided with thirty (30) days' notice to match such offer. If the City did not match the offer within thirty (30) days, the transmission provider would be free to sell the transmission rights to the alternate customer. Consequently,~~The Superintendent of the City Light Department, or his designee, is hereby further authorized to execute additional transmission services agreements for the transmission rights described in Exhibit A as needed to ensure that City Light has the ability to protect its transmission rights received under Exhibit A. The current form of PacifiCorp's Service Agreement for Long-Term Point-to-Point Transmission Service Under PacifiCorp's Open Access Transmission Tariff is attached hereto as Attachment 1.This additional authority shall also include authority to reassign such transmission rights for any period of time before 2011, or the termination of the Integration and Exchange Agreement with PacifiCorp Transmission relating to the Stateline Power Purchase Agreement, whichever is earlier, so long as such acts are consistent with the purpose of this ordinance.

~~Section 5. In the event any contracts are contemplated under the authority granted in Section 4, City Light shall without delay, provide a detailed report, complete with analysis, to the Council explaining the purposes and impacts of such agreements prior to its execution.~~~~~~

Section 2. All other provisions of Ordinance 121683 shall remain in full force and effect.

 Section 3. Any act consistent with the authority of this ordinance that is taken after its passage but prior to its effective date is hereby ratified and confirmed.

 Section 4. This ordinance shall take effect and be in force thirty (30) days from and after its approval by the Mayor, but if not approved and returned by the Mayor within ten (10) days after presentation, it shall take effect as provided by Municipal Code Section 1.04.020.
