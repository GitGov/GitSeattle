If such conditions continue for a second consecutive day or more, the Contractor shall, on the first day that regular service to a customer resumes, collect all the materials that the customer places out for collection, subject to reasonable limits to be agreed upon by Contractor and the City and set forth in the Operations Plan. On the day that collections resume, the Contractor shall take bags, boxes and other secure material, and shall empty temporary receptacles that customers have used when the collection Cans and Containers have been filled. The Contractor is authorized to perform collection services after 5:00 pm during, or immediately after, disruptions due to weather in order to finish the collection routes.

 The Contractor shall notify the City as soon as possible of any non- collection days due to snow or ice. The notification shall be made the previous day or by 6:00 a.m. of the collection day. The City will notify the media of such non-collection days.

 The Contractor shall not be paid for non-collections due to snow or ice. The City shall deduct $250 from the Contractor's regular monthly payment for each individual collection route which is not 90% collected by the end of the day following the scheduled collection day. The City has the option to require the Contractor to collect Recyclables the week following non-collection instead of deducting funds for non-collections.

 No performance fees will be applied for excused collections in accordance with Section 850.

 Section 170. Service Disruptions -- Non Weather.

 When closure of roadways providing access, blocked alleys or streets or other disruption beyond Contractor's control prevents timely collection on the scheduled day, the Contractor shall make collection either later on that collection day, or the next business day. The Contractor must provide all the collections required during the collection week. If all collections are not performed during the collection week, the City will adjust the Contractor's payment for such non-collection. The Contractor must notify the City, within 2 hours of the collection attempt, of any Residential Structure collections the Contractor has been unable to make under this Section.

 The Contractor may directly contact City of Seattle Parking Enforcement to request assistance to clear streets or blocked alleys, notify them of illegally parked cars, or request other assistance.

 When labor disruptions prevent collection on the scheduled day, the Contractor shall make collections on the next day. If such labor disruption continues for a second consecutive day or more, the Contractor shall, on the first day that regular service to a customer resumes, collect all the materials that the customer places out for collection, subject to reasonable limits to be agreed upon by Contractor and the City and set forth in the Operations Plan. On the day that collections resume, the Contractor shall take bags, boxes and other secure material, and shall empty temporary receptacles that customers have used when the collection Cans and Containers have been filled, subject to reasonable limits to be agreed upon by Contractor and the City and set forth in the Operations Plan. The Contractor is authorized to perform collection services after 5:00 pm during, or immediately after, labor disruptions in order to finish the collection routes.

 The Contractor shall not be paid for non-collections due to labor disruptions. The City shall deduct $250 from the Contractor's regular monthly payment for each individual collection route which is not 90% collected by the end of the day following the scheduled collection day. The City has the option to require the Contractor to collect Compostables and Recyclables the week following non- collection instead of deducting funds for non-collections.

 No performance fees will be applied for excused collections in accordance with Section 850.

 Section 175. Missed and Make-up Collections.

 Should the Contractor fail to make collections on a scheduled day for causes within the Contractor's control, the Contractor shall make a special make-up collection by the end of the business day, if notification of the miss is received by 10:00 am that business day, or by the end of the business day following notification by the City, if the notification is received after 10:00 am. The City will transmit to the Contractor missed collections and other collection complaints no later than the second business day following collection for customers receiving curb/alley service. The City will transmit missed collections for backyard customers no later than the third business day following collection. A make-up collection shall pick up excess material accumulated during the interval between the scheduled collection day and the special make-up collection.

 Solely for the purposes of Section 175, the "business day" for the Contractor includes Saturday. "Business days" for the City are Monday through Friday, excluding any City holidays. Therefore, all miss complaints transmitted to the Contractor after 10:00 am on Friday must be collected by the end of the day Saturday.

 Notwithstanding the foregoing, the City may require the Contractor to do the following:

 1) Authorize the Contractor to defer the collection and authorize the customer to place a proportionally larger amount out for collection on the customer's next scheduled collection day without any additional charge, and to accommodate such a disposal, allow the customer to use a bag or temporary Container as well as additional bundles; or

 2) Authorize the Contractor to forego collection for the interval altogether and make a compensatory reduction in the billing to the customer, and an equal reduction in the amount payable to the Contractor.

 It shall be a defense to a Residential Structure missed collection that the customer had not made timely placement of his or her material out for collection; that the placement did not comply with provisions of this Contract; and for Can collection of Garbage, Compostables, and Recyclables, that placement did not comply with Section 135 or that as to Detachable Container, or Drop Box collection of Garbage and Recyclables with Section 145; provided that the Contractor shall have left a City printed tag on all material left because it was not prepared properly, it was overweight or for other reasons.

 The Contractor must notify the City, within 2 hours of the collection attempt, of any Residential Structure collections the Contractor has refused or been unable to make via download into the City's billing and information system (Banner). This input shall include the service address, account number and the reason of the non-collection. This input shall be referred to as the Exception List "(EL)".

 If the City transmits a miss complaint to the Contractor which is on the EL, or the City transmits a miss outside of the times established above, the Contractor may charge the City for a special collection in accordance with Section 360. If the City transmits a miss complaint which is on the EL, and it is a miss which the Contractor should not collect due to the fact that the Can is overweight or contains material that should not be collected, the Contractor's office personnel shall note on the miss that the address is on the EL and note the reason that it was not collected and return the miss complaint to the City within four (4) business hours of its receipt, and the miss shall not be collected.

 If the Contractor's collection personnel return to collect a miss and the Contractor has reason to refuse the miss consistent with this Section, the Contractor shall leave a City printed tag, explaining why the material was not collected. The Contractor shall also inform the City by the end of the business day of the addresses that were not collected and the reason for the non-collection.

 This section applies to omitted collections of a single Residential Structure, a row of Residential Structures, and/or an entire route.

Ballard Bridge, or any state or federal highway is closed to truck traffic (excluding current truck restrictions on federal highways due to truck weight restrictions), 2) the high level West Seattle Bridge, the 15th Avenue W. Ballard Bridge, or any state or federal highway is closed to all traffic. Attachment 7, Haul Time Payment Allowance, specifies how the time differentials will be calculated.

 In the event that a major transportation artery used by Contractor in performing services under this Contract is under construction or otherwise subject to impediments that substantially impact traffic flow, then Contractor may request a temporary modification or relaxation of certain service terms under this Contract (e.g., collection start-times) and the City shall reasonably consider all such requests.

 The City may designate an alternate transfer station for the tipping of Garbage, Compostables, or Recyclables. The designation may be temporary or permanent. If the City directs the Contractor to an alternate transfer station that is outside of the DIA, or that departs from the defined transfer split of Garbage and Compostables collected north of the Ship Canal, the City will adjust the Contractor's payment according to the specifications in Attachment 7, Haul Time Payment Allowance.

 Section 183. Scavenging.

While collecting, employees shall wear or carry identification supplied by the Contractor. The identification shall be subject to approval of the City.

 When the Contractor identifies unsatisfactory conduct by an employee or when the City notifies the Contractor of such conduct, the Contractor shall take remedial action. The remedial action shall be appropriate to the level of unsatisfactory conduct, provided that if the City requests of the Contractor by letter that an employee be suspended from further work on the Contract for Level Three unsatisfactory conduct or an uncorrected pattern of Level Two unsatisfactory conduct, the Contractor will permanently remove the

 employee from further work on the Contract.

 Level One: Examples of Level One unsatisfactory conduct are single isolated incidents such as spillage of materials, leaving gates open, not relocking doors, walking through flower beds, not returning Containers to their proper location, not replacing lids, etc.

 If a pilot test affects regular collections, the parties shall

 negotiate an adjustment of the Contract payment to reflect the benefits and/or burdens of the pilot test.

 Section 820. Adjustments in 2010 - 2016.

 The City will compute inflation-adjusted payment amounts annually for both fixed and per-unit payments to the Contractor for the contract year beginning in April 2010 and later contract years as follows:

 Inflation Adjustment Factor: The "Inflation Adjustment Factor" will be based on three indices computed by the United States Department of Labor, Bureau of Labor Statistics. The three indices and their weights are: 1) the second-half annual consumer price index for Urban Wage Earners and Clerical Workers for the Seattle-Tacoma-Bremerton Area, Series ID No. CWURA423SAO, or successor indices, which will have a weight of 42%, 2) the Energy Information Agency annual West Coast Retail Price Series for On-Highway Diesel Fuel, Index No. PADD5, which will have a weight of 8%, and 3) the Employment Compensation Cost Index for Private Industry, in current dollars, December 2005=100, for Electric, Gas and Sanitary Services, Series ID No. ECU12542i, which will have a weight of 50%.

 The Inflation Adjustment Factor, for the contract year beginning in April 2010 through the contract year beginning in April 2014, will be calculated by taking the weighted average, based on the weights above, of one hundred percent (100%) of the percentage difference between the three indices' most recent year-end values and the corresponding values for the year ending December 2008, and adding the result to 1.0. The Inflation Adjustment Factor, for the contract year beginning in April 2015, and for each subsequent year thereafter, will be calculated by taking the weighted average, based on the weights above, of seventy-five percent (75%) of the percentage difference between the three indices' most recent year-end values and the corresponding values for the year ending December 2013, adding the result to 1.0, and multiplying that result by the Inflation Adjustment Factor for the contract year beginning in April 2014.

 This annual Inflation Adjustment Factor will be applied to all payments made under the Contract, unless otherwise noted herein. See Attachment 5 for a sample payment adjustment.

 Section 825. Can/Cart Collection Payment Adjustments.

 In addition to their annual adjustments for the Inflation Adjustment Factor defined in Section 820, the payments for Can collection of Garbage, and Cart collection of Recyclables and Compostables will also be adjusted annually for changes in their respective tonnages collected and structures served. (See Attachment 5 for a sample payment adjustment.) The specific bases for these payment adjustment calculations are as follows:

 1. Can Garbage Collection: The compensation for Residential Can Garbage collection for each Collection Area in each contract year shall be calculated from the initial contract-year payment as modified by the Inflation Adjustment Factor, multiplied by two additional adjustment factors to account for changes in: 1) tonnage of Residential Can Garbage collected, and 2) numbers of Can Structures served.

 Residential Can Garbage Collection Tonnage Adjustment Factor: The "Tonnage Adjustment Factor" for Residential Can Garbage collection for each Collection Area in each contract year will be based on the estimated tonnage of Residential Can Garbage collected by the Contractor in the Collection Area in the most recent calendar year, relative to the corresponding tonnage estimated to have been collected from that area during the calendar year 2009.

 Tonnage shares for each area for the years 2009 will be estimated as follows: a) the collected Residential Can Garbage tonnages from each area for the period April - December, 2009 will be recorded, and used to calculate percentage shares of the City-wide Residential Can Garbage tonnage for the calendar years 2009; b) those percentages will be multiplied by the recorded total Residential Can Garbage tonnages for the calendar years 2009, to derive base year tonnages for each Collection Area. Calendar year tonnages for 2010 and subsequent years will be based on Contractor records of actual Residential Can Garbage tonnage collected in the Collection Area.

 The Tonnage Adjustment Factor, for the contract year beginning in April 2011, and for each subsequent contract year, will be calculated by taking 35% of the percentage difference between the most recent calendar year's Residential Can Garbage tonnage collected in the Collection Area and the corresponding tonnage estimated to have been collected from that area for the calendar year 2009, and adding the result to 1.0.

 Residential Can Garbage Collection Structure Adjustment Factor: The "Structure Adjustment Factor" for Residential Can Garbage collection for each Collection Area in each contract year will be based on the number of Structures in the Collection Area receiving "active Garbage can rate services" in December, 2009, as reported by the City's Consolidated Customer Service System (CCSS) database.

 The Structure Adjustment Factor for each area, for the contract year beginning in April 2011, and for each subsequent year, will be calculated by taking 30% of the percentage difference between the number of CCSS accounts receiving active Garbage can rate services in that area in December of the most recent calendar year and the corresponding number of CCSS accounts in December, 2009, and adding the result to 1.0.

 2. Residential Cart Compostables Collection: The compensation for Residential Cart Compostables collection for each Collection Area in each contract year shall be calculated from the initial contract-year payment as modified by the Inflation Adjustment Factor, multiplied by two additional adjustment factors to account for changes in: 1) tonnage of Residential Cart Compostables collected, and 2) numbers of Structures receiving Residential Cart Compostables service.

 Cart Compostables Collection Tonnage Adjustment Factor: The "Tonnage Adjustment Factor" for Residential Cart Compostables collection for each Collection Area in each contract year will be based on the estimated tonnage of Residential Cart Compostables collected by the Contractor in the Collection Area in the most recent calendar year, relative to the corresponding tonnage estimated to have been collected from that area during the calendar year 2009.

 Tonnage shares for each area for the year 2009 will be estimated as follows: a) the collected Residential Cart Compostables tonnages from each area for the period April - December, 2009, will be recorded, and used to calculate percentage shares of the City-wide Residential Cart Compostables tonnage collected for the calendar year 2009; b) those percentages will be multiplied by the recorded total Residential Cart Compostables tonnages for calendar year 2009, to derive base year tonnages for each Collection Area. Calendar year tonnages for 2010 and subsequent years will be based on Contractor records of actual Residential Cart Compostables tonnage collected in the Collection Area.

 The Tonnage Adjustment Factor, for the contract year beginning in April 2011, and for each subsequent contract year, will be calculated by taking 35% of the percentage difference between the most recent calendar year's Residential Cart Compostables tonnage collected in the Collection Area and the corresponding tonnage estimated to have been collected from that area for the calendar year 2009, and adding the result to 1.0.

 Residential Cart Compostables Collection Structure Adjustment Factor: The "Structure Adjustment Factor" for Residential Cart Compostables collection for each Collection Area in each contract year will be based on the average number of accounts in the Collection Area receiving active Residential Yard Waste rate services in the most recent calendar year, as reported by the City's Consolidated Customer Service System (CCSS) and Commercial Solid Waste (CSW) database.

 The Structure Adjustment Factor for each area, for the contract year beginning in April 2010, and for each subsequent year, will be calculated by taking 30% of the percentage difference between the number of CCSS and CSW accounts receiving active Residential Yard Waste rate services in that area in December of the most recent calendar year and the corresponding number of CCSS accounts in December 2009, and adding the result to 1.0.

 3. Cart Recyclables Collection: The compensation for Cart Recyclables collection for each Collection Area in each contract year shall be calculated from the initial contract-year payment as modified by the Inflation Adjustment Factor, multiplied by two additional adjustment factors to account for changes in: 1) tonnage of Cart Recyclables collected, and 2) numbers of Structures with Cart Recyclables service.

 Cart Recyclables Collection Tonnage Adjustment Factor: The "Tonnage Adjustment Factor" for Cart Recyclables collection for each Collection Area in each contract year will be based on the estimated tonnage of Cart Recyclables collected by the Contractor in the Collection Area in the most recent calendar year, relative to the corresponding tonnage estimated to have been collected from that area during the calendar year 2009.

 Tonnage shares for each area for the years 2009 will be estimated as follows: a) the Cart Recyclables tonnages from each area for the period April - December 2009, will be recorded, and used to calculate percentage shares of the City-wide Cart Recyclables tonnage for the calendar year 2009; b) those percentages will be multiplied by the recorded total Cart Recyclables tonnages for the calendar year 2009, to derive 2009 base year tonnages of Recyclables for each Collection Area. Calendar year tonnages for 2010 and subsequent years will be based on Contractor records of actual Cart Recyclables tonnage collected in each Collection Area.

 The Tonnage Adjustment Factor for each Collection Area, for the contract year beginning in April 2011, and for each subsequent contract year, will be calculated by taking 25% of the percentage difference between the most recent calendar year's Cart Recyclables collected in the Collection Area and the corresponding tonnage estimated to have been collected from that area for the calendar year 2009, and adding the result to 1.0.

 Cart Recyclables Collection Structure Adjustment Factor: The "Structure Adjustment Factor" for Cart Recyclables collection for each Collection Area in each contract year will be based on the number of Structures with active Curb/Alley Recycling services in the Collection Area in December 2009, as reported by the City's Consolidated Customer Service System (CCSS) database and Commercial Solid Waste (CSW) database.

 The Structure Adjustment Factor for each area, for the contract year beginning in April 2011, and for each subsequent year, will be calculated by taking 40% of the percentage difference between the number of CCSS accounts receiving active Curb/Alley Recycling services in that area in December of the most recent calendar year and the corresponding number of CCSS and CSW accounts in December 2009, and adding the result to 1.0.

 Section 855. Payment Procedure.

 No later than the 10th of each month, the Contractor will submit an invoice, and monthly report per Section 730, to the City, for services provided during the prior month. The Contractor shall not receive their monthly compensation until all items required in Sections 710, 720 and 730 are accurately submitted to the City.

 This invoice will be paid by the City to the Contractor by wire transfer on or before the 30th of the same month (or 20 calendar days after the invoice date, if the invoice/monthly report is presented late). This invoice will be at a level of detail that will allow the

 City to determine the type (i.e., Garbage, Compostables or Recyclables), container size, frequency and per unit compensation associated with each service.

 Compensation paid by the City to the Contractor for services under this Contract will determine the taxable income under this Contract for which Contractor will be responsible for paying B&O taxes. It is

 the intent of both the City and the Contractor that Contractor's taxable income for services under this Contract is not based upon the remittances paid by the Commercial Waste customers to the Contractor acting as collecting agent for the City, including those taxes described in Section 620.

 The City, at its discretion, may make payments to the Contractor for the items listed in Section 800 (1) through (8) on a twice per month basis (the 15th and the 30th). Under this option the first Contractor payment (equal to 1/2 the monthly amount) would be due to the Contractor on April 15, 2009.

 Section 860. Wage Increases for Employees.

 All wage increases for collectors or any other employees of the Contractor granted during the term of this Contract shall be the sole responsibility of the Contractor. Any benefits or added costs resulting from changes in technology, laws and regulations, labor practices, availability of equipment, and other foreseeable business risks that may affect the performance of this Contract shall be to the Contractor's advantage or expense respectively, except as provided in Section 1295.

 Section 865. Prevailing Rate of Wage.

 The Contractor shall ensure that all Contractor and subcontractor collectors performing work under this Contract are paid not less than the prevailing rate of wage for the same trade or occupation as set by the City. The term "collectors" includes drivers, swampers, and others working on Garbage, Compostables, and Recyclables collection; it excludes office workers and management. If a collector, during the same pick-up, is collecting both Garbage and Recyclables, or Compostables and Recyclables (co-collection), he/she must be paid the highest prevailing rate of wage for collection.

 The term, "prevailing rate of wage" includes the hourly wage, usual benefits and overtime paid in the locality as defined in RCW 39.12.010(b). The Contractor's duty to pay the prevailing rate of wage and to ensure that subcontractors pay the prevailing rate of wage is absolute and mandatory. No worker may waive full compliance or accept a lesser sum.

 The prevailing rate of wage, as of 4/1/2009, for Garbage, and Compostables collectors, and workers collecting Recyclables is listed in Attachment 3. This Attachment will be updated and reissued in June, 2009 with an effective date of July 1, 2009, to reflect any changes in effect on April 1, 2009. The prevailing wage will then be updated on a yearly basis thereafter.

 Within thirty (30) days of starting collections on this Contract and thereafter on a yearly basis, the Contractor shall supply to each collector (including employees of the subcontractor) a copy of the prevailing wage. The Contractor shall also supply a copy to each new employee or temporary employee. The information shall be in both Spanish and English.

 Should an employee prevail in suit against the Contractor for wages or benefits due and establish that his or her wages paid were less than the prevailing rate of wage set forth in Attachment 3, the Contractor shall pay to the employee, in addition to the wages or benefits due and accrued interest, a reasonable attorney's fee, expert witness' fee, and court costs, as well as any other damages that may be awarded.

 Under-payment of prevailing wages shall be a material default of the Contract.

 Section 870. Hiring Preference.

 For initial hiring under this Contract the Contractor and subcontractors shall give hiring preference to any Garbage, Compostables or Recyclables collection workers who have been displaced as a result of the City awarding this Contract. All displaced collection workers that meet basic hiring requirements (including commercial drivers license, safe vehicle report, drug screening, physical exam, and background check) shall be hired for a minimum ninety (90) day trial period.

 Section 875. Payroll Records and Reports.

 The Contractor and subcontractors shall keep complete and accurate payrolls containing the following information with respect to each collector employed upon or in connection with this Contract:

 1) Name and residence address;

 2) Classification of work;

 3) City route number;

 4) Number of hours employed each day, as verified by a time clock record;

 5) Total number of hours employed each payroll period, as verified by a time clock record;

 6) Rate of wages;

 7) Total amount earned;

 8) All deductions;

 9) Net amount paid; and

 10) Funds paid by employer for prevailing benefits.

 All employees shall be paid in lawful money of the United States, in the full amount accrued to each employee at the time of closing the payroll.

 The Contractor's and subcontractor's payroll records shall be available for inspection by City staff during office hours at the Contractor's Seattle office.

 On a quarterly basis the Contractor and subcontractor shall file with the City an electronic copy of each payroll together with an electronic listing of time clock records and other above information.

 The City shall withhold payment on all estimates for work performed by the Contractor under this Contract until: (1) all payroll reports, with the above information of said Contractor and subcontractor for work performed have been filed with the City; and (2) all employees doing collection work under this Contract have been paid the prevailing rate of wage as determined by the City.

 Section 880. Withholding and Payment of Tax Liens and Judgments.

 The City may withhold and pay to the United States of America or to any federal court, or the State of Washington or any state court, the amount claimed in a levy filed by the United States Internal Revenue Service or the Washington State Department of Revenue, respectively; the amount directed by a writ of garnishment, writ of attachment, or writ of execution, or by an order of a Bankruptcy Court, and/or by any court order, each for monies claimed from the Contractor. When presented such an order, the City may in its discretion institute interpleader proceedings. The City may make a payment in conjunction with the interpleader action to the appropriate court. Payments so made or deposited into the registry of the court shall be satisfaction of payment due to the Contractor.

 Section 885. Withholding and Payment to Workers.

 If any worker doing collection work for the Contractor (or any subcontractor) shall be paid by a postdated check, a check presented and dishonored for insufficient funds on account, or other negotiable instrument or promissory note that is not payable on the worker's regular payroll date or paid when presented, the worker may present the unpaid document to the City and request payment directly from the City. The City shall contact the Contractor, and if payment is not made within twenty-four hours, the City may issue a warrant drawn on the City for the amount of the unpaid wages and the City shall deduct the amount paid, together with a service charge of Fifty Dollars ($50.00) per warrant from the next succeeding payment to be made to the Contractor.

 The initial Bond must be in place prior on or before April 1, 2009.

 The Bond shall be conditioned upon full performance of all obligations imposed upon the Contractor in this Contract. The Bond shall be subject to approval by the City Attorney as to the company, form and sufficiency of surety. If the instrument is found by the City Attorney to be flawed, the Contractor must correct the flaw promptly prior to contract execution or the award may be terminated.

 The Bond shall be in full force effect and shall be the obligation of the surety unless the Contractor shall faithfully perform all of the provisions of this Contract and pay all laborers, mechanics, subcontractors, materialmen and all persons who shall supply such Contractor or subcontractors with provisions and supplies for the performance of this Contract. The Bond shall contain appropriate recitations that it is issued pursuant to this Section of this Contract, that it shall be construed to meet all requirements specified herein and that any condition or limitation in the Bond which is in conflict with the conditions and requirements of this Section is void.

 Failure of the Contractor to furnish and maintain the Bond shall be considered a material default of this Contract and grounds of its immediate termination at the option of the City.

 Section 1010. Default of Contractor.

 This Section is independent, notwithstanding any other provisions of this Contract. Except as provided in the last paragraph of this Section 1010, the Contractor may be held in default of the Contract in the event the Contractor:

 To initiate proceedings under this Section, the City shall give notice to the Contractor and its surety of the location, time, and date within the following seven calendar days of a meeting with the Director at which the Contractor will be given the opportunity to correct the deficiency above and to show cause why it should not be declared in default or why it should be given the opportunity to cure said default. In the event the Contractor fails to show, to the reasonable satisfaction of the Director, why the Contractor should not be declared to be in default of this Contract, the Director may make a declaration of default. In evaluating whether to make such a declaration of default, the Director shall, in her/his discretion, consider the severity of the alleged violations, and the overall performance of the Contractor under the Contract.

 In declaring the Contractor to have defaulted on the Contract, the Director also may order the Contractor to discontinue further performance of work under the Contract and transfer the obligation to perform such work from the Contractor to the surety on the Contractor's performance Bond and take any other action it deems advisable.

 Upon receipt of a notice that the work has been transferred to the surety without termination of the Contract, the surety shall take possession of all materials and equipment described in the most recent inventory submitted to the City pursuant to Section 65 hereof, for the purpose of completing the work under the Contract; employ, by contract or otherwise, any person and all persons needed to perform the work; and provide materials and equipment required therefor. Such employment shall not relieve the surety of its obligations under the Contract and the bond. If there is a transfer to the surety, payments shall be made to the surety or its agent for all work performed under the Contract subsequent to such transfer, in amounts equal to those that would have been made to the Contractor had it performed in the manner and to the extent of the surety's performance, and the Contractor shall have no claim upon the same.

 In the event the surety on the Contractor's performance Bond fails to assume or continue performances within 48 hours after its receipt of notice that the work has been transferred to such surety, the Contractor shall lease, sublease or otherwise license the City to use all, or whatever portion is desired by the City, of the materials and equipment described on the most recent inventory submitted to the City pursuant to Section 65 hereof, for collection purposes for a period of up to six months following the date of the declaration of default by the City without requiring the City to execute any other document whatsoever to accomplish such lease, sublease, or license and without requiring the City to post any bond, pledge, deposit or other security for such equipment and materials, but upon the condition that the City pay for the equipment and materials actually used for such collection a market rental that is no greater than (i) the monthly lease, in the event such property is leased by the Contractor, (ii) the periodic installment, in the event such property is being acquired under a purchase contract, (iii) the periodic financing interest and principal, in the event such property is being acquired under a purchase contract, or (iv) the periodic interest and principal, in the event such property is being acquired under a financing arrangement; provided, that under no circumstances shall the City be liable during its use of such property for any arrearages, balloon payment, accrued interest, accelerated charges in the event of a default, or other extraordinary payment; nor shall the satisfaction thereof be a condition of the City's interim use of such property; provided, further, that such lease, sub-lease, or license shall be suspended the date the surety on the Contractor's bond or its agent accepts the transfer of work under the Contract.

 In the event the City secures the performance of work under the Contract at a lesser cost than would have been payable to the Contractor had the Contractor performed the same, then the City shall retain such difference; but in the event such cost to the City is greater, the Contractor and its surety shall be liable for and pay the amount of such excess to the City.

 All payments due the Contractor at the time of default, less amounts due the City from the Contractor, shall be applied by the City against damages suffered and expense incurred by the City by reason of such default, any excess shall be paid to the Contractor unless otherwise provided herein.

 Notwithstanding the provisions of this Section, a delay or interruption in the performance of all or any part of the Contract resulting from causes beyond the Contractor's control shall not be deemed to be a default and the rights and remedies of the City provided for herein shall be inapplicable; provided that labor disputes shall not be considered a cause beyond the Contractor's control.

 Section 1020. Commitment of Equipment.

 Unless a replacement or substitute is provided, all vehicles, facilities, equipment and property identified in the Contractor's inventory under Section 65 for use in the performance of this Contract (called "such property") shall be available for use in collecting Garbage, Compostables and Recyclables in the Collection Area. When provided, this Section applies to the replacement and substitute.

 For the duration of this Contract, any document (including a lease to or by the Contractor, financing contract, acquisition over time, mortgage, or other instrument establishing a security interest) that encumbers or limits the Contractor's interest in such property shall:

 1) Allow the surety on the Contractor's performance bond to take over the Contractor's obligations and to continue the use of the equipment in service for performance of the Contract;

 2) In event the Contractor is in default and the surety on the Contractor's performance bond fails to assume or continue performance within 48 hours after notice to do so, allow the City to use without

 further documentation all or a portion of such property, at the City's discretion, for a period of up to six months following the date of the City's declaration of default, to provide such collection services on the condition that the City pays to the City's lessor a market rental for the equipment or property actually used in an amount no greater than the monthly lease in event of a lease, the installment payment in event of a purchase contract, or the monthly interest and principal in event of a financing arrangement;

 3) Exempt the City from liability during its usage of such property for arrearages, balloon payments, accrued interest, accelerated charges on account of a default, or other extraordinary payments, and not make satisfaction thereof a condition of the City's interim usage; and

 4) Forbid any foreclosure, trustee's sale or other dispossession of the Contractor's interest in such property without giving both the City and surety on the Contractor's performance bond sixty days' prior notice, and then make any termination of the Contractor's interest in such property pursuant to such action or the enforcement thereof subject to the requirements of subsections (1), (2) and (3) of this Section.

 To assure compliance with this Section, the Contractor shall submit to the City for its review and approval or disapproval prior to execution all contracts, leases, or other documents for acquisition of, or encumbering or limiting the Contractor's interest in, such property or for replacements thereof and any proposed agreement that would encumber or transfer any interest of the Contractor in such property before the Contractor's execution of such agreement.

As to the City of Seattle, and for purposes of the Contractor's indemnification obligations under this Section 1040 only, the Contractor waives any immunity it may have under RCW Title 51 or any other Worker's Compensation statute. The parties acknowledge that this waiver has been specifically and mutually negotiated by them.

 Section 1050. Liquidated Damages.

 This Section is independent of Section 1010. The acts or omissions in the left hand column are a breach of this Contract; the amounts in the right hand column are set as Liquidated Damages. Liquidated Damages may be deducted from the monthly payment to the Contractor.

If the Contractor, for any reason, fails to make collections called for in the Contract for any period (except as provided for elsewhere in this Contract), with the result that any portion of the scheduled collection is not completed within a given calendar week, the City shall deduct, for such nonperformance, a reasonable amount from the Contractor's next monthly payment(s), which amount shall be based on, among other factors, the number of Residential Structures and/or Commercial Establishments from which collections have not been made, the duration of such failure of collection, and special costs including administrative expenses incurred by the City as a consequence of such failure.

 Procedures for applying, appealing and reversing liquidated damages will be included in the Operations Plan.

 Section 1060. Contract Buyout.

 If the City exercises this option, it will compensate the Contractor according to the schedule and amounts defined in Attachment 6.

 L. PROPRIETARY AND CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION

 Section 1100. No disclosure unless required by law.

 The parties agree that they will not permit the duplication or disclosure of any information designated in advance by the other party as "Confidential and Proprietary" to any person (other than its own employee, agent, or representative who must have such information for the performance of that party's obligations hereunder) unless such duplication, use or disclosure is specifically authorized in writing by the other party or is required by law. "Confidential and Proprietary" information does not include ideas, concepts, know-how or techniques related to information that, at the time of disclosure, is in the public domain unless the entry of that information into the public domain is a result of any breach of this Contract. Likewise, "Confidential and Proprietary" information does not apply to information that is independently developed, already possessed without obligation of confidentiality, or rightfully obtained from a third party without an obligation of confidentiality.

 Section 1110. Contractor's Understanding and Obligations.

 The Contractor understands that any records (including but not limited to proposal submittals, the Contract, and any other contract materials) it submits to the City, or that are used by the City even if the Contractor possesses the records, are public records under Washington State law, RCW Chapter 42.56. Public records must be promptly disclosed upon request unless a statute exempts them from disclosure. The Contractor also understands that even if part of a record is exempt from disclosure, the rest of that record generally must be disclosed.

 The Contractor must separate and clearly mark as "proprietary" information all records related to this Contract or the performance of this Contract that the Contractor believes are exempt from disclosure. The Contractor is to be familiar with potentially- applicable public disclosure exemptions and the limits of those exemptions, and will mark as "proprietary" only information that the Contractor believes legitimately fits within an exemption and will state the statutory exception upon which it is relying.

 If the City notifies the Contractor of a public records request, and the Contractor believes records are exempt from disclosure, it is the Contractor's responsibility to make its own determination and pursue a lawsuit under RCW 42.17.330 to enjoin disclosure. The Contractor must obtain the injunction and serve it on the City before the close of business on the tenth business day after the City sent notification to the Contractor. It is the Contractor's discretionary decision whether to file the lawsuit.

 If the Contractor does not timely obtain and serve an injunction, the Contractor is deemed to have authorized releasing the record.

 Notwithstanding the above, the Contractor must not take any action that would affect (a) the City's ability to use goods and services provided under this Contract or (b) the Contractor's obligations under this Contract.

 The Contractor will fully cooperate with the City in identifying and assembling records in case of any public disclosure request.

 Section 1120. The City's Obligations.

 The City will disclose those parts of records the Contractor has marked as "proprietary information" only to authorized persons unless: (a) the City discloses the records in response to a public records request or (b) the Contractor has given the City express advance written permission to disclose the records. "Authorized persons" means those City officers, employees, contractors and consultants for whom the proprietary information is necessary to perform their duties or obligations to the City. The term "proprietary information" does not include ideas, concepts, know-how or techniques related to any information that, at the time of disclosure, is in the public domain, unless the entry of that information into the public domain is a result of a breach of this Contract.

 If the City receives a public records request for records that Contractor has marked as "proprietary information", the City may promptly notify the Contractor of the request. The City may postpone disclosing these records for ten business days after it has sent notification to the Contractor, in order to allow the Contractor to file a lawsuit under RCW 42.56.540 to enjoin disclosure. It is the Contractor's discretionary decision whether to file the lawsuit.

 If the City has notified the Contractor of a public records request, and the Contractor has not obtained an injunction and served the City with that injunction by the close of business on the tenth business day after the City sent notice, the City may disclose the record.

 The City has no other obligations concerning records the Contractor has marked as "proprietary information" under this Contract. The City has no obligation to claim any exemption from disclosure. The City is not obligated or liable to the Contractor for any records that the City releases in compliance with this Section or in compliance with the order of a court of competent jurisdiction.

 Section 1225. Violation of Antitrust or Corrupt Practice Laws.

 In the event the Contractor is found to be guilty of a violation of antitrust or corrupt practice laws for acts performed in Washington during the term of this Contract, the City at its election may terminate this Contract by giving the Contractor written notice of the City's intent to terminate this Contract effective on the date designated by the City in the notice. For purposes of this Section,

 the "antitrust or corrupt practice laws" shall include all civil and criminal statutes, both state and federal, pertaining to the antitrust laws, fair practices acts, and any laws governing corrupt standards or practices. Further, for the purposes of this Section, the Contractor shall be considered to be "guilty" of a violation of such antitrust or corrupt practice laws if the Contractor or any of its officers or management employees: (1) enters a plea of guilty to a charge, (2) enters a plea of nolo contendere, or (3) is found guilty of a criminal violation or is held liable for a civil violation by the highest court or tribunal which considers the case.

 Captions are for convenient reference only. A caption does not limit the scope or add commentary to the text.

 Section 1285. Force Majeure - Suspension.

 This section applies in the event either party becomes unable to perform its obligations under this Contract as a result of a Force Majeure Event. A Force Majeure Event is an external event that is beyond the control of the party or its agents and that severely compromises the party's ability to perform its obligations under the Contract. Such events may include, but are not limited to, a natural or man-made disaster, an act of war or terrorism, or an action or decree of a superior governmental body, which prevents the party from performing its obligations under the Contract.

 Should either party suffer from a Force Majeure Event, such party

 shall provide the other party with notice as soon as practical and shall act with speed and diligence to mitigate any potential damage that may result from the event and resume performance of all its obligations under the Contract as soon as reasonably possible. When notice has been properly provided, the obligations of both parties shall be suspended to the extent that and for the period of time that the Force Majeure Event prevents the party from resuming performance of all its obligations under the Contract.

 Section 1290. Emergency and Priority Services - Major Service Disruption.

 This section applies in the event an emergency or disaster causes a major disruption to the Contractor's ability to maintain standard levels of service in the performance of its obligations under the Contract. Such events may include, but are not limited to, a severe storm, high wind, earthquake, flood, hazardous material release, transportation mishap, loss of any utility service, fire, terrorist activity or any combination of the above (except as provided in Sections 165 and 170). In such an event:

 1) The City may notify the Contractor of the emergency or disaster, describing the relevant circumstances arising from the event, and request emergency and priority services from the Contractor.

 2) Upon such notice from the City, the Contractor shall consult and work with the City to develop strategies and tactics to manage the emergency and provide services to restore the City to normal operating conditions as soon as reasonably possible. Certain disaster scenarios will be modeled and planned for in advance, to the extent possible. The Contractor shall exercise its best efforts in providing the emergency and priority services as requested by the City in as timely a manner as possible.

 3) The Contractor shall use commercially reasonable efforts to make the City's customers its first priority, and its efforts to provide City's customers with emergency and priority services shall, to the extent commercially reasonable, not be diminished as a result of the Contractor providing service to other customers.

 4) If the Contractor is unable to respond in the time requested by the City, the Contractor shall respond as soon as practical. The Contractor shall immediately assist the City to the extent reasonable in providing services, which may include offering the City substitutions, provided that the Contractor obtains prior approval from the City for the substitutions.

 5) The City shall compensate the Contractor for performing emergency and priority services under this section in a manner consistent with the compensation provisions of this Contract, and any additional collections performed by Contractor shall be paid at the Special Collection Rate, or as otherwise specified in the Contingency Plan.

 The City and Contractor shall work in good faith to develop a mutually acceptable Contingency Plan, as an appendix to the Operation Plan. The Contingency Plan shall serve as a planning and operational tool to allow the Parties to respond effectively and responsibly to emergencies and disasters in accordance with this section.

 Section 1295. Adjustment -- Change of Law or Prolonged Change in Circumstances due to a Force Majeure Event.

 This section applies in the event a change in federal, state, or local laws or a prolonged change in circumstances due to a Force Majeure Event results in a substantial increase (or decrease) in costs to the Contractor in the performance of its obligations under this Contract. To qualify as a substantial increase in costs under this section, Contractor must demonstrate to the satisfaction of the City that the change in law or the prolonged change in circumstances due to a Force Majeure Event has resulted in an increase of more than ten percent over the actual costs incurred by the Contractor for the same services provided under this Contract (provided that all such increased costs shall be eligible for adjustment hereunder). A change in law under this section does not include changes in law with respect to property, income, business, payroll, franchise, employment, excise, sales or other general use taxes, but does include any solid waste or fuel taxes or fees enacted or amended during the term of this Contract (including any federal or state "carbon tax" or "gas tax"), provided such taxes or fees are not otherwise passed through directly to customers or are otherwise covered by the Diesel Fuel Index adjustment, Section 820.

 The Contractor may request an adjustment under this section. Any adjustment the City decides to grant under this section shall be prospective only. If the Contractor decides to request an adjustment under this section, the Contractor shall file with the City an adjustment request setting forth the Contractor's calculation of its increase in costs and documenting how the increase qualifies as a substantial increase in costs under this section. The burden of demonstrating that the Contractor has suffered a substantial increase in costs under this section rests with the Contractor. The Contractor shall provide the City with any and all documentation and data reasonably necessary to evaluate the request. The City shall act within 90 days of receipt of a properly filed request and may either grant, grant in part, or deny the request, which shall not be unreasonably denied.

 In the event a change in federal, state, or local law or a prolonged change in circumstances due to a Force Majeure Event has resulted in a substantial decrease of more than ten percent from the actual costs incurred by the Contractor for the same services provided under this Contract (provided that all such decreased costs shall be eligible for adjustment hereunder), then the City may make an adjustment under this section. The burden of demonstrating that the Contractor has enjoyed a substantial decrease in costs under this section rests with the City. The Contractor shall provide the City with any and all documentation and data reasonably necessary to determine whether the Contractor has enjoyed a substantial decrease in costs, and upon 60 days prior notice from the City, the Contractor shall accept an adjustment to reflect such decrease in its costs.

 IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the parties hereto have executed this Contract by having their representatives affix their signatures below.

 Contract Buyout Calculations

 Contract Vehicle Cost Allowance

 At the beginning of the Contract, the City will calculate a "Contract Vehicle Cost Allowance" for the purposes of calculating the potential vehicle purchase payment, as called for in Section 1060. The Contract Vehicle Cost Allowance will be calculated as $200,000 per vehicle for compactor collection trucks, multiplied by the number of Contract compactor vehicles defined by the City and the Contractor at the outset of the Contract.

 Buyout Schedule

 The City's potential buyout payments, as described in Section 1060, will be based on the "Contract Vehicle Cost Allowance" above, multiplied by the percentage in Table 6 below that corresponds to the month at the end of which the termination becomes effective.

 Table 6

 Contract Buyout Payment Percentages

 Buy-Out Date Percentage of Allowance Buy-Out Date Percentage of Allowance April 2014 45.5% October 2015 23.7% July 2014 42.1% January 2016 19.7% October 2014 38.6% April 2016 15.7% January 2015 35.0% July 2016 11.5% April 2015 31.3% October 2016 7.3% July 2015 27.5% January 2017 3.0%

 In the event that the City exercises the Contract Buyout, and makes payment to the Contractor as defined herein, the Contractor will transfer to the City full ownership in all vehicles included in the Contract Vehicle Cost Allowance calculation.

 Attachment 7

 Haul Time Payment Allowance

 Attachment 7 - Haul Time Payment Allowance

 Compensation for Highway Closure Impacts on Haul Time

 In the event of a closure to the high level West Seattle Bridge, the 15th Avenue W. Ballard Bridge, or state or federal highway for three (3) days or more, either to collection vehicles or to all vehicles, the City will estimate the additional haul time required for the transfer trips using the Seattle Department of Transportation (SDOT) Travel Analysis Model.

 The SDOT Travel Analysis Model will be used to calculate the one-way haul time from the Contractor's Route Center to the facility south of the Ship Canal at which it has been directed to transfer a specified portion of its tonnage of any waste stream, under two conditions:

 1) The high level West Seattle Bridge, the 15th Avenue W. Ballard Bridge, or state or federal highway is open to all vehicles; and either:

 2) The high level West Seattle Bridge, the 15th Avenue W. Ballard Bridge, or state or federal highway is closed to collection vehicles, but open to other vehicles, or

 3) The high level West Seattle Bridge, the 15th Avenue W. Ballard Bridge, or state or federal highway is closed to all vehicles, as appropriate.

 The City will then calculate the total annual increase in haul travel time by: a) calculating the difference between 1) and either 2) or 3), as appropriate to the high level West Seattle Bridge, the 15th Avenue W. Ballard Bridge, or state or federal highway traffic limitations, b) multiply that difference expressed in hours by the number of Contractor transfer trips affected, and c) double the result to obtain the total increase in annual round-trip haul travel time.

 The City will compensate the Contractor for the resulting number of additional hours at a rate of $112/hour, effective in the first Contract year. The per-hour rate for any compensation in later Contract years will be calculated by applying the Inflation Adjustment Factor defined in Section 820, at a 50% adjustment factor.

 Compensation for Redirected Transfer Trips

 The City will adjust the Contractor's payment for redirected transfer of Garbage, Compostables, or Recycling tonnage in any of the following "Transfer Payment Adjustment Conditions":

 1) The City directs less than 40% or more than 60% of Garbage collected north of the Ship Canal to the City's North Recycle and Disposal Station.

 2) The City directs less than 40% or more than 60% of Compostables collected north of the Ship Canal to the City's North Recycle and Disposal Station.

 3) The City directs less than 100% of Garbage collected south of the Ship Canal to a transfer facility located in the Duwamish Industrial Area (DIA).

 4) The City directs less than 100% of Compostables collected south of the Ship Canal to a transfer facility located in the DIA.

 5) The City directs less than 100% of Recycling collected in the City to a transfer facility located in the DIA.

 If the City directs the Contractor to an alternate transfer station so that any of the preceding Transfer Payment Adjustment Conditions are met, the City will adjust the Contractor's payment as follows:

 1) The "Route Center" for the Contractor's Collection Area shall be defined as the intersection of (insert street intersection of collection center of Contract Collection Area);

 2) Using the SDOT Travel Analysis Model, the City will measure the distance from the Route Center to the present transfer station site, in miles, one way, along the most direct route on streets usable by collection trucks;

 3) Again using the SDOT Travel Analysis Model, the City will measure the distance from the Route Center to the alternate or new transfer station site, in miles, one way, along the most direct route on streets usable by collection trucks;

 4) The City will then multiply the difference in those two distances by the number of tons of Garbage, Compostables, and/or Recyclables collected under this Contract and actually delivered to the alternate or new transfer station site, to the extent that those deliveries

 meet one of the Transfer Payment Adjustment Conditions above; and

 5) The City will then multiply the ton-miles by the rate of $1.00 per ton-mile.

 Example A:

 The Contractor collects 60,000 tons of Garbage north of the Ship Canal in a Contract year. Between 24,000 (40%) and 36,000 (60%) of that amount can be directed to the City's North Recycling and Disposal Station without payment adjustment.

 The City in that Contract year directs 36,000 tons to a facility within the DIA, 14,000 tons to the North Recycling and Disposal Station, and 10,000 tons to King County First NE Transfer Station. The 10,000 tons directed to the King County facility trigger a payment adjustment per Transfer Payment Adjustment Condition #1.

 The Route Center for the area north of the Ship Canal is (for this example) N 85th Street and Meridian Avenue.

 Distance, 85th and Meridian to NRDS: 3.2 miles

 Distance, 85th and Meridian to First NE: 3.9 miles

 Ton-miles redirected (3.9 - 3.2) * 10,000 = 7,000

 Payment Adjustment, to the Contractor: $7,000

 Example B:

 The Contractor collects 100,000 tons of Garbage south of the Ship Canal in a Contract year. In the preceding year, all 100,000 tons had been directed to the City's South Recycling and Disposal Station.

 The City in that Contract year directs 50,000 tons to the facility at 3rd & Lander, within the DIA, and the other 50,000 tons to a new "Southwest" facility outside the DIA. The 50,000 tons directed to the 3rd & Lander facility does not trigger a payment adjustment, since the facility is still within the DIA. The remaining 50,000 tons, however, does trigger a payment adjustment per Transfer Payment Adjustment Condition #3.

 The Route Center for the area south of the Ship Canal is (for this example) 4th Avenue S and S Spokane Street.

 Distance, 4th S and Spokane to SRDS: 2.1 miles

 Distance, 4th S and Spokane to Southwest: 3.7 miles

 Ton-miles redirected (3.7 - 2.1) * 50,000 = 80,000

 Payment Adjustment, to the Contractor: $80,000

 ? Pollution Liability Insurance minimum limits of liability may be evidenced with separate coverage.

 2) Authorize the Contractor to forego collection for the interval altogether and make a compensatory reduction in the billing to the customer, and an equal reduction in the amount payable to the Contractor.

 It shall be a defense to a Residential Structure missed collection that the customer had not made timely placement of his or her material out for collection; that the placement did not comply with provisions of this Contract; and for Can collection of Garbage, Compostables, and Recyclables, that placement did not comply with Section 135 or that as to Detachable Container, or Drop Box collection of Garbage, Compostables, and Recyclables with Section 145; provided that the Contractor shall have left a City printed tag on all material left because it was not prepared properly, it was overweight or for other reasons.

 If the City transmits a miss complaint to the Contractor which is on the EL, or the City transmits a miss outside of the times established above, the Contractor may charge the City for a special collection in accordance with Section 360. If the City transmits a miss complaint which is on the EL, and it is a miss which the Contractor should not collect due to the fact that the Can is overweight or contains material that should not be collected, the Contractor's office personnel shall note on the miss that the address is on the EL and note the reason that it was not collected and return the miss complaint to the City within four (4) business hours of its receipt, and the miss shall not be collected.

 If the Contractor's collection personnel return to collect a miss and the Contractor has reason to refuse the miss consistent with this Section, the Contractor shall leave a City printed tag, explaining why the material was not collected. The Contractor shall also inform the City by the end of the business day of the addresses that were not collected and the reason for the non-collection.

 Section 820. Adjustments in 2010 - 2016.

 The City will compute inflation-adjusted payment amounts annually for both fixed and per-unit payments to the Contractor for the contract year beginning in April 2010 and later contract years as follows:

 Inflation Adjustment Factor: The "Inflation Adjustment Factor" will be based on three indices computed by the United States Department of Labor, Bureau of Labor Statistics. The three indices and their weights are: 1) the second-half annual consumer price index for Urban Wage Earners and Clerical Workers for the Seattle-Tacoma-Bremerton Area, Series ID No. CWURA423SAO, or successor indices, which will have a weight of 42%, 2) the Energy Information Agency annual West Coast Retail Price Series for On-Highway Diesel Fuel, Index No. PADD5, which will have a weight of 8%, and 3) the Producers' Price Index for Labor in Service-Producing Industries (National), Series ID No. ECS12102i, which will have a weight of 50%.

 The Inflation Adjustment Factor, for the contract year beginning in April 2010, and for each subsequent contract year, will be calculated by taking the weighted average, based on the weights above, of the percentage difference between the three indices' most recent year-end values and the corresponding values for the year ending December 2008, and adding the result to 1.0.

 This annual Inflation Adjustment Factor will be applied to all payments made under the Contract, unless otherwise noted herein. See Attachment 5 for a sample payment adjustment.

 Section 825. Can/Cart Collection Payment Adjustments.

 In addition to their annual adjustments for the Inflation Adjustment Factor defined in Section 820, the payments for Can collection of Garbage, and Cart collection of Recyclables and Compostables will also be adjusted annually for changes in their respective tonnages collected and structures served. (See Attachment 5 for a sample payment adjustment.) The specific bases for these payment adjustment calculations are as follows:

 1. Can Garbage Collection: The compensation for Residential Can Garbage collection for each Collection Area in each contract year shall be calculated from the initial contract-year payment as modified by the Inflation Adjustment Factor, multiplied by two additional adjustment factors to account for changes in: 1) tonnage of Residential Can Garbage collected, and 2) numbers of Can Structures served.

 Residential Can Garbage Collection Tonnage Adjustment Factor: The "Tonnage Adjustment Factor" for Residential Can Garbage collection for each Collection Area in each contract year will be based on the estimated tonnage of Residential Can Garbage collected by the Contractor in the Collection Area in the most recent calendar year, relative to the corresponding tonnage estimated to have been collected from that area during the calendar year 2009.

 Tonnage shares for each area for the years 2009 will be estimated as follows: a) the collected Residential Can Garbage tonnages from each area for the period April - December, 2009 will be recorded, and used to calculate percentage shares of the City-wide Residential Can Garbage tonnage for the calendar years 2009; b) those percentages will be multiplied by the recorded total Residential Can Garbage tonnages for the calendar years 2009, to derive base year tonnages for each Collection Area. Calendar year tonnages for 2010 and subsequent years will be based on Contractor records of actual Residential Can Garbage tonnage collected in the Collection Area.

 The Tonnage Adjustment Factor, for the contract year beginning in April 2011, and for each subsequent contract year, will be calculated by taking 35% of the percentage difference between the most recent calendar year's Residential Can Garbage tonnage collected in the Collection Area and the corresponding tonnage estimated to have been collected from that area for the calendar year 2009, and adding the result to 1.0.

 Residential Can Garbage Collection Structure Adjustment Factor: The "Structure Adjustment Factor" for Residential Can Garbage collection for each Collection Area in each contract year will be based on the number of Structures in the Collection Area receiving "active Garbage can rate services" in December, 2009, as reported by the City's Consolidated Customer Service System (CCSS) database.

 The Structure Adjustment Factor for each area, for the contract year beginning in April 2011, and for each subsequent year, will be calculated by taking 30% of the percentage difference between the number of CCSS accounts receiving active Garbage can rate services in that area in December of the most recent calendar year and the corresponding number of CCSS accounts in December, 2009, and adding the result to 1.0.

 2. Residential Cart Compostables Collection: The compensation for Residential Cart Compostables collection for each Collection Area in each contract year shall be calculated from the initial contract-year payment as modified by the Inflation Adjustment Factor, multiplied by two additional adjustment factors to account for changes in: 1) tonnage of Residential Cart Compostables collected, and 2) numbers of Structures receiving Residential Cart Compostables service.

 Cart Compostables Collection Tonnage Adjustment Factor: The "Tonnage Adjustment Factor" for Residential Cart Compostables collection for each Collection Area in each contract year will be based on the estimated tonnage of Residential Cart Compostables collected by the Contractor in the Collection Area in the most recent calendar year, relative to the corresponding tonnage estimated to have been collected from that area during the calendar year 2009.

 Tonnage shares for each area for the year 2009 will be estimated as follows: a) the collected Residential Cart Compostables tonnages from each area for the period April - December, 2009, will be recorded, and used to calculate percentage shares of the City-wide Residential Cart Compostables tonnage collected for the calendar year 2009; b) those percentages will be multiplied by the recorded total Residential Cart Compostables tonnages for calendar year 2009, to derive base year tonnages for each Collection Area. Calendar year tonnages for 2010 and subsequent years will be based on Contractor records of actual Residential Cart Compostables tonnage collected in the Collection Area.

 The Tonnage Adjustment Factor, for the contract year beginning in April 2011, and for each subsequent contract year, will be calculated by taking 35% of the percentage difference between the most recent calendar year's Residential Cart Compostables tonnage collected in the Collection Area and the corresponding tonnage estimated to have been collected from that area for the calendar year 2009, and adding the result to 1.0.

 Residential Cart Compostables Collection Structure Adjustment Factor: The "Structure Adjustment Factor" for Residential Cart Compostables collection for each Collection Area in each contract year will be based on the average number of accounts in the Collection Area receiving active Residential Yard Waste rate services in the most recent calendar year, as reported by the City's Consolidated Customer Service System (CCSS) and Commercial Solid Waste (CSW) database.

 The Structure Adjustment Factor for each area, for the contract year beginning in April 2010, and for each subsequent year, will be calculated by taking 30% of the percentage difference between the number of CCSS and CSW accounts receiving active Residential Yard Waste rate services in that area in December of the most recent calendar year and the corresponding number of CCSS accounts in December 2009, and adding the result to 1.0.

 3. Cart Recyclables Collection: The compensation for Cart Recyclables collection for each Collection Area in each contract year shall be calculated from the initial contract-year payment as modified by the Inflation Adjustment Factor, multiplied by two additional adjustment factors to account for changes in: 1) tonnage of Cart Recyclables collected, and 2) numbers of Structures with Cart Recyclables service.

 Cart Recyclables Collection Tonnage Adjustment Factor: The "Tonnage Adjustment Factor" for Cart Recyclables collection for each Collection Area in each contract year will be based on the estimated tonnage of Cart Recyclables collected by the Contractor in the Collection Area in the most recent calendar year, relative to the corresponding tonnage estimated to have been collected from that area during the calendar year 2009.

 Tonnage shares for each area for the years 2009 will be estimated as follows: a) the Cart Recyclables tonnages from each area for the period April - December 2009, will be recorded, and used to calculate percentage shares of the City-wide Cart Recyclables tonnage for the calendar year 2009; b) those percentages will be multiplied by the recorded total Cart Recyclables tonnages for the calendar year 2009, to derive 2009 base year tonnages of Recyclables for each Collection Area. Calendar year tonnages for 2010 and subsequent years will be based on Contractor records of actual Cart Recyclables tonnage collected in each Collection Area.

 The Tonnage Adjustment Factor for each Collection Area, for the contract year beginning in April 2011, and for each subsequent contract year, will be calculated by taking 25% of the percentage difference between the most recent calendar year's Cart Recyclables collected in the Collection Area and the corresponding tonnage estimated to have been collected from that area for the calendar year 2009, and adding the result to 1.0.

 Cart Recyclables Collection Structure Adjustment Factor: The "Structure Adjustment Factor" for Cart Recyclables collection for each Collection Area in each contract year will be based on the number of Structures with active Curb/Alley Recycling services in the Collection Area in December 2009, as reported by the City's Consolidated Customer Service System (CCSS) database and Commercial Solid Waste (CSW) database.

 The Structure Adjustment Factor for each area, for the contract year beginning in April 2011, and for each subsequent year, will be calculated by taking 40% of the percentage difference between the number of CCSS accounts receiving active Curb/Alley Recycling services in that area in December of the most recent calendar year and the corresponding number of CCSS and CSW accounts in December 2009, and adding the result to 1.0.

 Section 855. Payment Procedure.

 No later than the 10th of each month, the Contractor will submit an invoice, and monthly report per Section 730, to the City, for services provided during the prior month. The Contractor shall not receive their monthly compensation until all items required in Sections 710, 720 and 730 are accurately submitted to the City.

 This invoice will be paid by the City to the Contractor by wire transfer on or before the 30th of the same month (or 20 calendar days after the invoice date, if the invoice/monthly report is presented late). This invoice will be at a level of detail that will allow the City to determine the type (i.e., Garbage, Compostables or

 Recyclables), container size, frequency and per unit compensation associated with each service.

 Compensation paid by the City to the Contractor for services under this Contract will determine the taxable income under this Contract for which Contractor will be responsible for paying B&O taxes. It is the intent of both the City and the Contractor that Contractor's taxable income for services under this Contract is not based upon the remittances paid by the Commercial Waste customers to the Contractor acting as collecting agent for the City, including those taxes described in Section 620.

 The City will make payments to the Contractor for the items listed in Section 800 (1) through (9), not including any unit or ancillary service payments associated with these payments, on a twice per month basis (the 15th and the 30th). Under this option the first Contractor payment (equal to 1/2 the monthly amount) would be due to the Contractor on April 15, 2009.

 Section 860. Wage Increases for Employees.

 All wage increases for collectors or any other employees of the Contractor granted during the term of this Contract shall be the sole responsibility of the Contractor. Any benefits or added costs resulting from changes in technology, laws and regulations, labor practices, availability of equipment, and other foreseeable business risks that may affect the performance of this Contract shall be to the Contractor's advantage or expense respectively, except as provided in Section 1295.

 Section 865. Prevailing Rate of Wage.

 The Contractor shall ensure that all Contractor and subcontractor collectors performing work under this Contract are paid not less than the prevailing rate of wage for the same trade or occupation as set by the City. The term "collectors" includes drivers, swampers, and others working on Garbage, Compostables, and Recyclables collection; it excludes office workers and management. If a collector, during the same pick-up, is collecting both Garbage and Recyclables, or Compostables and Recyclables (co-collection), he/she must be paid the highest prevailing rate of wage for collection.

 The term, "prevailing rate of wage" includes the hourly wage, usual benefits and overtime paid in the locality as defined in RCW 39.12.010(b). The Contractor's duty to pay the prevailing rate of wage and to ensure that subcontractors pay the prevailing rate of wage is absolute and mandatory. No worker may waive full compliance or accept a lesser sum.

 The prevailing rate of wage, as of 4/1/2009, for Garbage, and Compostables collectors, and workers collecting Recyclables is listed in Attachment 3. This Attachment will be updated and reissued in June, 2009 with an effective date of July 1, 2009, to reflect any changes in effect on April 1, 2009. The prevailing wage will then be updated on a yearly basis thereafter.

 Within thirty (30) days of starting collections on this Contract and thereafter on a yearly basis, the Contractor shall supply to each collector (including employees of the subcontractor) a copy of the prevailing wage. The Contractor shall also supply a copy to each new employee or temporary employee. The information shall be in both Spanish and English.

 Should an employee prevail in suit against the Contractor for wages or benefits due and establish that his or her wages paid were less than the prevailing rate of wage set forth in Attachment 3, the Contractor shall pay to the employee, in addition to the wages or benefits due and accrued interest, a reasonable attorney's fee, expert witness' fee, and court costs, as well as any other damages that may be awarded.

 Under-payment of prevailing wages shall be a material default of the Contract.

 Section 870. Hiring Preference.

 For initial hiring under this Contract the Contractor and subcontractors shall give hiring preference to any Garbage, Compostables or Recyclables collection workers who have been displaced as a result of the City awarding this Contract. All displaced collection workers that meet basic hiring requirements (including commercial drivers license, safe vehicle report, drug screening, physical exam, and background check) shall be hired for a minimum ninety (90) day trial period.

 Section 875. Payroll Records and Reports.

 The Contractor and subcontractors shall keep complete and accurate payrolls containing the following information with respect to each collector employed upon or in connection with this Contract:

 1) Name and residence address;

 2) Classification of work;

 3) City route number;

 4) Number of hours employed each day, as verified by a time clock record;

 5) Total number of hours employed each payroll period, as verified by a time clock record;

 6) Rate of wages;

 7) Total amount earned;

 8) All deductions;

 9) Net amount paid; and

 10) Funds paid by employer for prevailing benefits.

 All employees shall be paid in lawful money of the United States, in the full amount accrued to each employee at the time of closing the payroll.

 The Contractor's and subcontractor's payroll records shall be available for inspection by City staff during office hours at the Contractor's Seattle office.

 On a quarterly basis the Contractor and subcontractor shall file with the City an electronic copy of each payroll together with an electronic listing of time clock records and other above information.

 The City shall withhold payment on all estimates for work performed by the Contractor under this Contract until: (1) all payroll reports, with the above information of said Contractor and subcontractor for work performed have been filed with the City; and (2) all employees doing collection work under this Contract have been paid the prevailing rate of wage as determined by the City.

 Section 880. Withholding and Payment of Tax Liens and Judgments.

 The City may withhold and pay to the United States of America or to any federal court, or the State of Washington or any state court, the amount claimed in a levy filed by the United States Internal Revenue Service or the Washington State Department of Revenue, respectively; the amount directed by a writ of garnishment, writ of attachment, or writ of execution, or by an order of a Bankruptcy Court, and/or by any court order, each for monies claimed from the Contractor. When presented such an order, the City may in its discretion institute interpleader proceedings. The City may make a payment in conjunction with the interpleader action to the appropriate court. Payments so made or deposited into the registry of the court shall be satisfaction of payment due to the Contractor.

 Section 885. Withholding and Payment to Workers.

 If any worker doing collection work for the Contractor (or any subcontractor) shall be paid by a postdated check, a check presented and dishonored for insufficient funds on account, or other negotiable instrument or promissory note that is not payable on the worker's regular payroll date or paid when presented, the worker may present the unpaid document to the City and request payment directly from the City. The City shall contact the Contractor, and if payment is not made within twenty-four hours, the City may issue a warrant drawn on the City for the amount of the unpaid wages and the City shall deduct the amount paid, together with a service charge of Fifty Dollars ($50.00) per warrant from the next succeeding payment to be made to the Contractor.

 The Contractor shall provide and maintain at all times a valid Irrevocable Standby Letter of Credit (Performance), conforming to the International Chamber of Commerce Publication No. 500,or similar financial instrument acceptable to the City (a "Surety Instrument"), in an amount no less than twenty percent (20%) of the estimated annual compensation to the Contractor under the Contract. The Surety Instrument shall be issued for a period of not less than one year and the Contractor shall provide a new Surety Instrument, or evidence satisfactory to the City of the renewability of the current Surety Instrument at least 90 calendar days before it expires.

 The initial Surety Instrument must be in place prior on or before March 30, 2009.

 The Surety Instrument shall be conditioned upon full performance of all obligations imposed upon the Contractor in this Contract and subject to approval by the City Attorney as to the company, form and sufficiency of surety. If the instrument is found by the City

 Attorney to be flawed, the Contractor must correct the flaw promptly prior to contract execution or the award may be terminated.

 The Surity Instrument shall contain appropriate recitations that it is issued pursuant to this Section of this Contract, that it shall be construed to meet all requirements specified herein and that any condition or limitation in the Surety Instrument which is in conflict with the conditions and requirements of this Section is void.

 Failure of the Contractor to furnish and maintain the Surety Instrument shall be considered a material default of this Contract and grounds of its immediate termination at the option of the City.

 Section 1010. Default of Contractor.

 This Section is independent, notwithstanding any other provisions of this Contract. Except as provided in the last paragraph of this Section, the Contractor may be held in default of the Contract in the event the Contractor:

 1) Fails to perform ninety percent (90%) the collections required by this Contract and appears, to the City, to have abandoned the work, or to be unable to resume collections within forty-eight hours;

 2) Has failed on three or more occasions of three (3) working days duration each, in any year, or fifteen (15) days in a calendar year to perform the collections required by the Contract; except as otherwise provided in Section 165;

 3) Fails to comply with the prevailing wage requirements per Section 865;

 4) Fails to comply with the terms of any of the Sections in Chapter J;

 5) Fails to furnish and maintain a Surety Instrument per Section 1000;

 6) Fails to furnish and maintain Insurance per Section 1030; or

 7) Repeatedly neglects, fails, or refuses to comply with any of the terms of the Contract, after having received notice of its obligation to do so.

 To initiate proceedings under this Section, the City shall give notice to the Contractor and its Lender of the location, time, and date within the following seven calendar days of a meeting with the Director at which the Contractor will be given the opportunity to correct the deficiency above and to show cause why it should not be declared in default or why it should be given the opportunity to cure said default. The Lender may attend such meeting. In the event the Contractor fails to show, to the reasonable satisfaction of the Director, why the Contractor should not be declared to be in default of this Contract, the Director may make a declaration of default. In evaluating whether to make such a declaration of default, the Director shall, in her/his discretion, consider the severity of the alleged violations and the overall performance of the Contractor under the Contract.

 Upon such declaration of default, the City may, subject to the Lender's rights described in this Section and Section 1015, terminate the Contract; provided that no such termination shall be effective unless and until either:

 (1) the Contractor (or the Lender) has failed to cure the default within five business days, including by procurement of a third party entity to perform the obligations of the Contractor (a "Substitute Operator"); or

 (2) the City or a Substitute Operator has executed either an agreement with the Lender to pay the Lender any remaining principal due the Lender (excluding any arrearages, balloon payment, accrued interest, accelerated charges in the event of a default, or other extraordinary payment) on the most recent inventory described in Section 65 or an agreement with the Lender to assume the Contractor's periodic obligations to the Lender concerning the principal and interest payments (excluding any arrearages, balloon payment, accrued interest, accelerated charges in the event of a default, or other extraordinary payment) to become due on the most recent inventory described in Section 65. Upon the City's payment of principal or satisfaction of Contractor's periodic obligations, the Lender shall as soon as reasonably practical transfer title to the inventory to the City or its nominee.

 Without terminating the Contract, the Director may nevertheless order the Contractor to discontinue further performance of work under the Contract and transfer the obligation to perform such work from the Contractor to a Substitute Operator designated by the City. Additionally, without terminating the Contract, the Director may allow the Lender additional time to cure the default, including by procurement of a Substitute Operator, who shall be subject to the City's approval in its sole discretion.

 A Substitute Operator shall have the right to take possession of all materials and equipment, as described in Section 1020. If the Director transfers the Contractor's obligations to perform under the Contract to a Substitute Operator, the City shall pay the Substitute Operator for all work it performs under the Contract, and the Contractor shall have no claim upon such payments; provided, however, that unless the City has executed an agreement with the Lender to pay the remaining principal or to assume the Contractor's periodic obligations, as described above, the City's payments to the Substitute Operator shall be conditioned upon the Substitute Operator's execution of an agreement with the Lender providing for the satisfaction of Contractor's periodic obligations. If within six months of the Director's transferring the Contractor's obligations to perform under the Contract to a Substitute Operator, the Substitute Operator has not executed an agreement with the Lender providing for the satisfaction of the Contractor's periodic payments, then the City may terminate the Contract and have no further obligations hereunder.

 The City may take any other action it deems advisable, consistent with the foregoing, in order to protect its rate-payers and the public health, safety, and welfare. Nothing in this Contract relating to any rights given the Lender shall be construed to require any payments by the City to the Lender, except to the extent the City and Lender may enter into an agreement as described above, or to relieve the Contractor of its obligations and liabilities arising under this Contract.

 In the event the City secures the performance of work under the Contract at a lesser cost than would have been payable to the Contractor had the Contractor performed the same, then the City shall retain such difference; but in the event such cost to the City is greater, the Contractor shall be liable for and pay the amount of such excess to the City.

 In the event the Director declares the Contractor in default, the Director may draw on the Surety Instrument to cover the costs the City incurs as a result of the default, including, without limitations, costs the City incurs while Contractor or Lender is attempting to cure a default.

 All payments due the Contractor at the time of default, less amounts due the City from the Contractor, shall be applied by the City

 against damages suffered and expense incurred by the City by reason of such default, any excess shall be paid to the Contractor unless otherwise provided herein.

 Notwithstanding the provisions of this Section, a delay or interruption in the performance of all or any part of the Contract resulting from causes beyond the Contractor's control shall not be deemed to be a default and the rights and remedies of the City provided for herein shall be inapplicable; provided that labor disputes shall not be considered a cause beyond the Contractor's control.

 Section 1015. Lender's Rights.

 The Lender is not a party to this Contract, nor is it a beneficiary except as specifically provided in this Section. For the limited purposes of securing the Contractor's payment of its obligations to the Lender relating to the equipment and other assets used in the performance of this Contract, the Contractor may grant the Lender an assignment or other security interest in this Contract. For such limited purposes, the City hereby consents to such assignment and agrees to execute a consent to assignment and such other documentation of the assignment and the Lender's security interest as may reasonably be requested by the Lender.

 If (1) the Director has declared a default, (2) the City or a Substitute Operator has not executed either an agreement with the Lender to pay the Lender any remaining principal due the Lender or an agreement with the Lender to assume the Contractor's periodic obligations to the Lender, as provided in Section 1010, and (3) the Lender cannot practicably cure the default without Lender taking possession of the equipment and other assets Contractor used in its performance under this Contract, then the City shall not take action to terminate this Agreement so long as the Lender (1) proceeds to obtain possession of the assets as mortgagee (through the appointment of a receiver or otherwise), diligently pursues judicial or non- judicial foreclosure proceedings or assignment in lieu of foreclosure, as appropriate, and upon obtaining possession, promptly commences and diligently prosecutes to completion such action as may be necessary to make effective the provisions relating to the City and any Substitute Operator described herein and (2) pays and continues to pay all compensatory damages and performance fees payable under this Contract throughout the entire period during which the Lender is attempting to effect a cure and/or obtain possession of the assets whether through the City's drawing on the Surety Instrument or otherwise.

 The Lender shall not be required to continue to attempt to a cure or obtain possession of the equipment; provided, however, that if such Lender shall have commenced to cure or attempt to cure the Contractor default, the Lender shall give Notice to City of any decision to cease to cure or attempt to cure such Contractor default, and shall pay all compensatory damages and performance fees payable under this Contract through the date of such Notice.

 If this Agreement terminates for any reason, including, without limitation, a default by Contractor hereunder or rejection of this Contract in any bankruptcy proceeding, and within thirty (30) days after notice to the Lender of such termination, the Lender makes a written request to the City to enter into a new Contract, then the City will consider entering into a new Contract with the Lender (or a Substitute Operator, subject to approval of the City). The City will not unreasonably withhold its approval of a new Contract, provided that (1) the Lender continues to keep current all compensatory damages and performance fees under this Contract up to and including the effective date of the new Contract, (2) the terms of the new Contract are no less favorable to the City than the terms of this Contract, (3) the Lender delivers to the City a written agreement, acceptable to the City, to cure all defaults of Contractor under this

 Contract (other than defaults which the Lender cannot cure or cause to be cured), and (4) the Lender pays all outstanding sums of money due under this Contract.

 Section 1020. Commitment of Equipment.

 Unless a replacement or substitute is provided, all vehicles, facilities, equipment and property identified in the Contractor's inventory under Section 65 for use in the performance of this Contract (called "such property") shall be available for use in collecting Garbage, Compostables and Recyclables in the Collection Area. When provided, this Section applies to the replacement and substitute.

 For the duration of this Contract, any document (including a lease to or by the Contractor, financing contract, acquisition over time, mortgage, or other instrument establishing a security interest) that encumbers or limits the Contractor's interest in such property shall:

 1) In event the Contractor is in default, allow the City to use without further documentation all or a portion of such property and without requiring the City to post any bond, pledge, deposit or other security for such equipment and materials, at the City's discretion, for a period of up to six months following the date of the City's declaration of default, to provide such collection services on the condition that the City pays to the Lender for the equipment or property actually used in an amount no greater than the monthly lease in event of a lease, the installment payment in event of a purchase contract, or the monthly interest and principal in event of a financing arrangement;

 2) In event the Contractor is in default, allow a Substitute Contractor to use all or a portion of such property for a period of up to six months following the date of the City's declaration of default, to provide such collection services on the condition that the Substitute Contractor executes an agreement with the Lender requiring it to pay the Lender for the equipment or property actually used in an amount no greater than the monthly lease in event of a lease, the installment payment in event of a purchase contract, or the monthly interest and principal in event of a financing arrangement;

 3) Exempt the City or the Substitute Contractor from liability during its usage of such property for arrearages, balloon payments, accrued interest, accelerated charges on account of a default, or other extraordinary payments, and not make satisfaction thereof a condition of the City's or the Substitute Contractor's interim usage; and

 4) Forbid any foreclosure, trustee's sale or other dispossession of the Contractor's interest in such property without giving both the City and the Lender sixty days' prior notice, and then make any termination of the Contractor's interest in such property pursuant to such action or the enforcement thereof subject to the requirements of subsections (1), (2) and (3) of this Section.

 Contractor agrees to cooperate with the City and any Substitute Operator and hereby agrees to lease, rent or otherwise transfer its right to use the equipment and to promptly execute any leases or other documents reasonably required to allow the latter to take over operations and use the equipment in the manner described in this Section and Sections 1010 and 1015.

 To assure compliance with this Section, the Contractor shall submit to the City for its review and approval or disapproval prior to execution all contracts, leases, or other documents for acquisition of, or encumbering or limiting the Contractor's interest in, such property or for replacements thereof and any proposed agreement that would encumber or transfer any interest of the Contractor in such property before the Contractor's execution of such agreement. The City's approval shall not be unreasonably withheld.

As to the City of Seattle, and for purposes of the Contractor's indemnification obligations under this Section 1040 only, the Contractor waives any immunity it may have under RCW Title 51 or any other Worker's Compensation statute. The parties acknowledge that this waiver has been specifically and mutually negotiated by them.

 L. PROPRIETARY AND CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION

 Section 1100. No disclosure unless required by law.

 The parties agree that they will not permit the duplication or disclosure of any information designated in advance by the other party as "Confidential and Proprietary" to any person (other than its own employee, agent, or representative who must have such information for the performance of that party's obligations hereunder) unless such duplication, use or disclosure is specifically authorized in writing by the other party or is required by law. "Confidential and Proprietary" information does not include ideas, concepts, know-how or techniques related to information that, at the time of disclosure, is in the public domain unless the entry of that information into the public domain is a result of any breach of this Contract. Likewise, "Confidential and Proprietary" information does not apply to information that is independently developed, already possessed without obligation of confidentiality, or rightfully obtained from a third party without an obligation of confidentiality.

 Section 1110. Contractor's Understanding and Obligations.

 The Contractor understands that any records (including but not limited to proposal submittals, the Contract, and any other contract materials) it submits to the City, or that are used by the City even if the Contractor possesses the records, are public records under Washington State law, RCW Chapter 42.56. Public records must be promptly disclosed upon request unless a statute exempts them from disclosure. The Contractor also understands that even if part of a record is exempt from disclosure, the rest of that record generally must be disclosed.

 The Contractor must separate and clearly mark as "proprietary" information all records related to this Contract or the performance of this Contract that the Contractor believes are exempt from disclosure. The Contractor is to be familiar with potentially- applicable public disclosure exemptions and the limits of those exemptions, and will mark as "proprietary" only information that the Contractor believes legitimately fits within an exemption and will state the statutory exception upon which it is relying.

 If the City notifies the Contractor of a public records request, and the Contractor believes records are exempt from disclosure, it is the Contractor's responsibility to make its own determination and pursue a lawsuit under RCW 42.17.330 to enjoin disclosure. The Contractor must obtain the injunction and serve it on the City before the close of business on the tenth business day after the City sent notification to the Contractor. It is the Contractor's discretionary decision whether to file the lawsuit.

 If the Contractor does not timely obtain and serve an injunction, the Contractor is deemed to have authorized releasing the record.

 Notwithstanding the above, the Contractor must not take any action that would affect (a) the City's ability to use goods and services provided under this Contract or (b) the Contractor's obligations under this Contract.

 The Contractor will fully cooperate with the City in identifying and assembling records in case of any public disclosure request.

 Section 1120. The City's Obligations.

 The City will disclose those parts of records the Contractor has marked as "proprietary information" only to authorized persons unless: (a) the City discloses the records in response to a public records request or (b) the Contractor has given the City express advance written permission to disclose the records. "Authorized persons" means those City officers, employees, contractors and consultants for whom the proprietary information is necessary to perform their duties or obligations to the City. The term "proprietary information" does not include ideas, concepts, know-how or techniques related to any information that, at the time of disclosure, is in the public domain, unless the entry of that information into the public domain is a result of a breach of this Contract.

 If the City receives a public records request for records that Contractor has marked as "proprietary information", the City may promptly notify the Contractor of the request. The City may postpone disclosing these records for ten business days after it has sent notification to the Contractor, in order to allow the Contractor to file a lawsuit under RCW 42.56.540 to enjoin disclosure. It is the

 Contractor's discretionary decision whether to file the lawsuit.

 If the City has notified the Contractor of a public records request, and the Contractor has not obtained an injunction and served the City with that injunction by the close of business on the tenth business day after the City sent notice, the City may disclose the record.

 The City has no other obligations concerning records the Contractor has marked as "proprietary information" under this Contract. The City has no obligation to claim any exemption from disclosure. The City is not obligated or liable to the Contractor for any records that the City releases in compliance with this Section or in compliance with the order of a court of competent jurisdiction.

 Section 1285. Force Majeure - Suspension.

 This section applies in the event either party becomes unable to perform its obligations under this Contract as a result of a Force Majeure Event. A Force Majeure Event is an external event that is beyond the control of the party or its agents and that renders the party severely compromised in its ability to perform all its obligations under the Contract. Such events may include a natural or man-made disaster or an action or decree of a superior governmental body, which completely prevents the party from performing all its obligations under the Contract. In circumstances where the Contractor's performance of its obligations under the Contract is not completely prevented, but is disrupted by an emergency or disaster, the provisions of Section 1290 shall apply.

 Should either party suffer from a Force Majeure Event, such party shall provide the other party with notice as soon as practical and shall act with speed and diligence to mitigate any potential damage that may result from the event and resume performance of all its obligations under the Contract as soon as possible. When notice has been properly provided, the obligations of both parties shall be suspended for the period of time the Force Majeure Event prevents the party from resuming performance of all its obligations under the Contract.

 This section applies in the event an emergency or disaster causes a major disruption to the Contractor's ability to maintain standard levels of service in the performance of its obligations under the Contract.

In such an event:

 1) The City shall notify the Contractor of the emergency or disaster, describing the relevant circumstances arising from the event, and request emergency and priority services from the Contractor.

 2) Upon such notice from the City, the Contractor shall consult with the City and exercise its best efforts in providing the emergency and priority services as requested by the City in as timely a manner as possible.

 3) The Contractor shall make the City's customers its first priority, and its efforts to provide City's customers with emergency and priority services shall not be diminished as a result of the Contractor providing service to other customers.

 4) If the Contractor is unable to respond in the time requested by the City, the Contractor shall respond as soon as practical. The Contractor shall immediately assist the City to the extent reasonable in providing services, which may include offering the City substitutions, provided that the Contractor obtains prior approval from the City for the substitutions.

 Attachment 5 Sample Payment Adjustments

 Attachment 6: Contract Buyout Calculations

 Contract Vehicle Cost Allowance

 At the beginning of the Contract, the City will calculate a "Contract Vehicle Cost Allowance" for the purposes of calculating the potential vehicle purchase payment, as called for in Section 1060. The Contract Vehicle Cost Allowance will be calculated as $275,000 per vehicle for compactor collection trucks, multiplied by the number of Contract compactor vehicles defined by the City and the Contractor at the outset of the Contract.

 Buyout Schedule

 The City's potential buyout payments, as described in Section 1060, will be based on the "Contract Vehicle Cost Allowance" above, multiplied by the percentage in Table 6 below that corresponds to the month at the end of which the termination becomes effective.

 Table 6

 Contract Buyout Payment Percentages

 Buy-Out Date Percentage of Allowance Buy-Out Date Percentage of Allowance April 2014 45.5% October 2015 23.7% July 2014 42.1% January 2016 19.7% October 2014 38.6% April 2016 15.7% January 2015 35.0% July 2016 11.5% April 2015 31.3% October 2016 7.3% July 2015 27.5% January 2017 3.0%

 In the event that the City exercises the Contract Buyout, and makes payment to the Contractor as defined herein, the Contractor will transfer to the City full ownership in all vehicles included in the Contract Vehicle Cost Allowance calculation.

 Attachment 7 - Haul Time Payment Allowance

 Compensation for Alaskan Way Viaduct Closure Impacts on Haul Time

 In the event of an Alaskan Way Viaduct closure for a week or more, either to collection vehicles or to all vehicles, the City will estimate the additional haul time required for the transfer trips of a Contractor whose collection zone includes an area north of the Ship Canal, using the Seattle Department of Transportation (SDOT) Travel Analysis Model.

 The SDOT Travel Analysis Model will be used to calculate the one-way haul time from the Contractor's Route Center in its North Seattle collection area to the facility south of the Ship Canal at which it has been directed to transfer a specified portion of its tonnage of any waste stream, under two conditions:

 1) The Alaskan Way Viaduct is open to all vehicles; and either:

 2) The Alaskan Way Viaduct is closed to collection vehicles, but open to other vehicles, or

 3) The Alaskan Way Viaduct is closed to all vehicles, as appropriate.

 The City will then calculate the total annual increase in haul travel time by: a) calculating the difference between 1) and either 2) or 3), as appropriate to the Alaskan Way Viaduct traffic limitations, b) multiply that difference expressed in hours by the number of Contractor transfer trips affected, and c) double the result to obtain the total increase in annual round-trip haul travel time.

 The City will compensate the Contractor for the resulting number of additional hours at a rate of $112/hour, effective in the first Contract year. The per-hour rate for any compensation in later Contract years will be calculated by applying the Inflation Adjustment Factor defined in Section 820.

 Compensation for Redirected Transfer Trips

 The City will adjust the Contractor's payment for redirected transfer of Garbage, Compostables, or Recycling tonnage in any of the following "Transfer Payment Adjustment Conditions":

 1) The City directs less than 40% or more than 60% of Garbage collected north of the Ship Canal to the City's North Recycle and Disposal Station.

 2) The City directs less than 40% or more than 60% of Compostables collected north of the Ship Canal to the City's North Recycle and Disposal Station.

 3) The City directs less than 100% of Garbage collected south of the Ship Canal to a transfer facility located in the Duwamish Industrial Area (DIA).

 4) The City directs less than 100% of Compostables collected south of the Ship Canal to a transfer facility located in the DIA.

 5) The City directs less than 100% of Recycling collected in the City to a transfer facility located in the DIA.

 If the City directs the Contractor to an alternate transfer station so that any of the preceding Transfer Payment Adjustment Conditions are met, the City will adjust the Contractor's payment as follows:

 1) The "Route Center" for the Contractor's Collection Area shall be defined as the intersection of (insert street intersection of collection center of Contract Collection Area);

 2) Using the SDOT Travel Analysis Model, the City will measure the distance from the Route Center to the present transfer station site, in miles, one way, along the most direct route on streets usable by collection trucks;

 3) Again using the SDOT Travel Analysis Model, the City will measure the distance from the Route Center to the alternate or new transfer station site, in miles, one way, along the most direct route on streets usable by collection trucks;

 4) The City will then multiply the difference in those two distances by the number of tons of Garbage, Compostables, and/or Recyclables collected under this Contract and actually delivered to the alternate or new transfer station site, to the extent that those deliveries meet one of the Transfer Payment Adjustment Conditions above; and

 5) The City will then multiply the ton-miles by the rate of $1.00 per ton-mile.

 Example A:

 The Contractor collects 60,000 tons of Garbage north of the Ship Canal in a Contract year. Between 24,000 (40%) and 36,000 (60%) of that amount can be directed to the City's North Recycling and Disposal Station without payment adjustment.

 The City in that Contract year directs 36,000 tons to a facility within the DIA, 14,000 tons to the North Recycling and Disposal Station, and 10,000 tons to King County First NE Transfer Station. The 10,000 tons directed to the King County facility trigger a payment adjustment per Transfer Payment Adjustment Condition #1.

 The Route Center for the area north of the Ship Canal is (for this example) N 85th Street and Meridian Avenue.

 Distance, 85th and Meridian to NRDS: 3.2 miles Distance, 85th and Meridian to First NE: 3.9 miles

 Ton-miles redirected (3.9 - 3.2) * 10,000 = 7,000

 Payment Adjustment, to the Contractor: $7,000

 Example B:

 The Contractor collects 100,000 tons of Garbage south of the Ship Canal in a Contract year. In the preceding year, all 100,000 tons had been directed to the City's South Recycling and Disposal Station.

 The City in that Contract year directs 50,000 tons to the facility at 3rd & Lander, within the DIA, and the other 50,000 tons to a new "Southwest" facility outside the DIA. The 50,000 tons directed to the 3rd & Lander facility does not trigger a payment adjustment, since the facility is still within the DIA. The remaining 50,000 tons, however, does trigger a payment adjustment per Transfer Payment Adjustment Condition #3.

 The Route Center for the area south of the Ship Canal is (for this example) 4th Avenue S and S Spokane Street.

 Distance, 4th S and Spokane to SRDS: 2.1 miles Distance, 4th S and Spokane to Southwest: 3.7 miles Ton-miles redirected (3.7 - 2.1) * 50,000 = 80,000 Payment Adjustment, to the Contractor: $80,000
