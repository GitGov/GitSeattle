 THE CITY OF SEATTLE

 COALITION OF CITY UNIONS

 (Amending certain existing collective bargaining agreements

 expiring December 31, 2010)

 WHEREAS, certain unions representing employees at the City of Seattle have formed a coalition (herein referred to as the "Coalition of City Unions") to collectively negotiate wages, health care, retirement and other conditions of employment with the City of Seattle (herein referred to as "the City;" together the City and the Coalition of City Unions shall be referred to as "the Parties"); and

 WHEREAS, the Coalition of City Unions for the purpose of this Memorandum of Understanding shall include the following individual unions, provided that named unions are also signatory to this Memorandum of Understanding: the International Brotherhood of Boilermakers, Iron Ship Builders, Blacksmiths, Forgers and Helpers, Local 104; the International Union of Painters and Allied Trades District Council #5; the Inlandboatmen's Union of the Pacific; the International Federation of Professional and Technical Engineers, Local 17; the International Brotherhood of Teamsters, Local 117; the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers, Local 46; the United Association of Journeymen and Apprentices of the Plumbing and Pipe Fitting Industry, Local 32; the International Brotherhood of Teamsters, Local 763; the International Union of Operating Engineers, Local 286; the UNITE Hotel Employees & Restaurant Employees, Local 8; the Public Service & Industrial Employees, Local 1239; the Washington State Council of County and City Employees, Local 21; the Joint Crafts Council; the International Alliance of Theatrical Stage Employees and Moving Picture Technicians, Artists and Allied Crafts of the United States and Canada, Local 15; the Sheet Metal Workers International Association, Local 66; and the Seattle Municipal Court Marshals' Guild, International Union of Police Associations, Local 600; and the Seattle Police Dispatchers' Guild; and

 WHEREAS, Ordinance 122551 authorized the October 3, 2007 Tentative Agreement between the Parties, and certain additional ordinances authorized collective bargaining agreements consistent with the Tentative Agreement between the Parties for the period of January 1, 2008 through December 31, 2010; and

 WHEREAS, Seattle Municipal Code 4.36, as amended by ordinance, provides for the administration and funding of the Seattle City Employees' Retirement System; and

 WHEREAS, the Parties have voluntarily entered into negotiations on wages, health care, retirement and other conditions of employment and have come to the following agreement:

 1) Existing collective bargaining agreements between the parties shall be amended so that the term of the agreement covers the time period of January 1, 2008 through December 31, 2011;

 2) All wages, hours, and working conditions shall continue as expressed in the labor agreements between the Parties, with the exception of the following items:

 A) Effective January 5, 2011, the wages of all job titles represented by the Coalition of City Unions signatory to this Memorandum of Understanding shall be increased by 100% of the annual average growth rate of the bi- monthly Seattle-Tacoma-Bremerton Area Consumer Price Index for Urban Wage Earners and Clerical Workers (CPI-W) for the period August 2008 through June 2009 to the period August 2009 through June 2010, provided however, said percentage increase shall not be less than two percent (2%) nor shall it exceed seven percent (7%).

 B) The parties agree that the Seattle Municipal Code regarding the funding of the Seattle City Employees' Retirement System (hereinafter, "System") shall be amended consistent with the following language:

 If a year-end actuarial study commissioned by the System finds that the amortization period for the System's unfunded actuarial liability exceeds thirty (30) years, based on the current contribution rate of 8.03% to the System that the City and employee(s) each pay, and the City determines that an increase in contribution rates to the System is necessary, the City and employees shall equally increase contribution rates. Such increases shall not result in employees paying greater than a 10.03% contribution rate.

 The required contribution rate increases, if necessary, shall take effect no sooner than the beginning of the first pay period of the year following completion of the actuarial study. For example, if the actuarial study for the System as of December 31, 2008 was presented to the Retirement Board in June 2009, and if that study showed an amortization period for the unfunded liability in excess of thirty (30) years that the City determined required a total increase in contributions of one percent (1%) to meet the System's unfunded liability threshold, the City's contribution rate would increase by one-half of one percent (.5%) resulting in an 8.53% City contribution rate and the employee contribution rate would increase by one-half of one percent (.5%) resulting in an 8.53% employee contribution rate as soon as the beginning of the first pay period of 2010.

 C) All conditions of employment specific to calendar year 2010 as provided in existing labor agreements shall be extended through calendar year 2011. All provisions pertinent to and referencing a three year contract shall extend to a four year contract expiring December 31, 2011.

 D) Unions shall vote a Voluntary Employee Benefits Association (VEBA) benefit among their membership consistent with the VEBA language in their existing contracts to determine union members' participation in a VEBA for calendar year 2011.
