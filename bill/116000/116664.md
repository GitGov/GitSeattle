</td></tr></table> B. Scheduling Window and Procedures:

 The City will not be required to Approve or confirm University's request to schedule KeyArena for any Home Game, including any pre-season, regular season or post-season game, unless the game occurs during the Scheduling Window and the scheduling procedures in this Agreement are followed. The Scheduling Window is based upon the official NCAA season and tournament schedule.

 C. Selection of Regular Season Home Games Dates:

 1. By the April 1 immediately preceding each NCAA season during the Term of this Agreement, the Director will provide University with a list of a minimum of eighteen (18) potential regular season Home Game dates occurring during the Scheduling Window.

 2. If University increases the number of regular season Home Games, the City will proportionately increase the offered number of potential Home Game dates conditioned upon the following:

 a) University notifies the City of the number of additional Home Game dates added prior to the time the City makes its annual date offer; and

 b) The increased number of regular season Home Games falls within the Scheduling Window.

 If University requests additional potential dates after the City makes its annual date offer, the City will use its best efforts to provide additional dates in light of City commitments to other clients.

 3. By July 1 immediately following the City's annual date offer, University will notify the Director, in writing, of those dates on the Director's list on which University wishes to license the KeyArena for a regular season Home Game. Such dates will be reserved for University's Home Games and will be referred to as "Confirmed Dates". Any dates not selected by University as Confirmed Dates by July 1 will be deemed relinquished and will be available for the City to use or license, at its discretion.

 D. Scheduling of Pre-Season Home Games:

 At any time, University may ask the Director to hold potential dates for pre-season Home Games. The Director will hold the requested dates for University, provided that the dates are within the Scheduling Window and are not already held for or contractually committed to another licensee. At the earliest possible opportunity, but in any case, no less than sixty (60) days prior to each potential pre-season Home Game date, University will confirm its intention, in writing, to use KeyArena for the requested dates. Any dates not so confirmed will be deemed released and will not be held for University. If the Director receives a third-party request for the use of KeyArena on a date reserved for a pre-season Home Game prior to the time when University is required to confirm the date, the Director may request in writing that University confirm or release the date. University will have seventy-two (72) hours from the time of the request to confirm the date in writing, otherwise the date will be deemed released and the City may license KeyArena to the third party.

 E. Scheduling of Post-Season Home Games:

 In the event University is eligible to participate in a post-season tournament which may require additional Home Game dates, University shall notify the Director, in writing, of those dates which it wishes to use KeyArena for post-season Home Games. Provided such dates are within the Scheduling Window and that KeyArena is not already held for or contractually committed to another licensee, the Director will hold the requested dates for University. At the earliest possible opportunity University shall confirm its intention, in writing, to use KeyArena for the requested dates. If the Director receives a third-party request for the use of KeyArena on a date reserved for a post-season Home Game prior to University confirming the date, the Director may request in writing that University confirm or release the date. University will have seventy-two (72) hours from the time of the request to confirm the date in writing, otherwise the date will be deemed released and the City may license KeyArena to the third party.

 F. Director's Endorsement:

 The Director shall prepare and issue a written "use date endorsement notice" to University for each Confirmed Date.

 V. PREMISES, EQUIPMENT AND FIXTURES AVAILABLE FOR USE BY UNIVERSITY

 A. Premises:

 Subject to the Permitted Hours of Use (Section V.E. below), on each Home Game Day University will have the right to use and to authorize others to use those portions of KeyArena, including equipment and fixtures, that are reasonably necessary for the playing, exhibition, viewing of, and attendance at, a NCAA Division I college basketball event.

 B. Suites:

 If all of the suites in KeyArena have not been licensed for use by one or more third parties, on each Home Game Day, University will be entitled to use two (2) 16-seat suites that are specified from time to time by the Director. Additionally, University will be entitled to use one additional 16-seat suite (a "Third Suite") for four (4) Home Games per Season until such time as all suites have been licensed for use by third parties. University will notify the Director at least thirty (30) days in advance of those Home Game Days on which University desires to utilize a Third Suite and the Director will identify which unlicensed suites, if any, will be available for University use. University will not relicense or sell the suites, and will use the suites subject to the rules and conditions imposed on suite licensees, but University will not be charged a license or use fee for the suites.

 2. On any Home Game Day on which the Premises must be converted from another use to a basketball facility, University will be permitted to use the Premises beginning at 9:00 a.m. and ending at 11:50 p.m. of that same day, but the use will not be exclusive to University as the City staff will be cleaning the Premises and converting it to basketball use. The City will schedule the conversion work so that the installation and use of the basketball floor by University is a priority.

 3. On any Home Game Day on which the Premises must be converted on that same day from a basketball use to a different use, University will be permitted to use the Premises until one hour after the completion of any scheduled Home Game, unless the Director specifies a later time.

 University will ensure that no Home Game commences before 12:00 noon without the prior written approval of the Director.

 University is hereby granted the right to use the Common Areas of Seattle Center and the KeyArena (including but not limited to lobbies, balconies, mezzanine, corridors, concourses, ramps, stairs, landings, vomitories, elevators and public restrooms) in common with other authorized third parties. Additionally, upon reasonable notice to the City, University may access the areas of the KeyArena that have been specifically licensed for University's use at times other than Home Game Days in order to ensure the delivery of necessary equipment, supplies and materials; to remove waste materials; and to complete other activities reasonably necessary to facilitate the Permitted Use.

 H. Practice Sessions:

If the Premises are used for practice sessions, University will reimburse the City for costs associated with such use.

 I. Non-Home Game Events:

 Subject to availability and at no additional cost to the City, University may request, at no additional cost, access to the Premises for recruiting potential student-athletes. Subject to availability, University may request access to the Premises to host up to five (5) fan generation or appreciation events each Season on days when no Home Game is scheduled. The decision whether to grant the use shall be at the Director's discretion, and the City will not be obligated to confirm the event any sooner than forty-five (45) days prior to the event. University shall be responsible for reimbursing all City costs associated with the event, but no License Fee will be charged.

 VI. PARKING

 A. First Avenue North Parking Garage:

 University will be entitled to one hundred and fifty (150) parking permits authorizing parking in the First Avenue North Parking Garage for each Home Game Day.

The City shall ensure that the design on the basketball floor featuring the name of the basketball floor shall remain clearly visible and unobscured at all times when the basketball floor is used by any tenant.

 VIII. CITY'S RIGHT TO LICENSE OR USE KEYARENA FOR BASKETBALL AND OTHER EVENTS

 C. Nondiscrimination in Employment:

 University will comply with all applicable equal employment opportunity and nondiscrimination laws of the United States, the State of Washington, and City of Seattle, including but not limited to Chapters 14.04, 14.10, 20.42, and 20.45 of the Seattle Municipal Code (SMC), and the Americans with Disabilities Act, as they may be amended, and all rules, regulations, orders, and directives of the associated administrative agencies and their officers.

 D. Attendance and Safety Standards:

 The Seattle Fire Chief or his/her designee has the authority to determine, in the reasonable exercise of his/her discretion, the number of persons that may be admitted to, and safely and freely move about in the Premises. University will not sell or issue Home Game tickets or credentials for admission to any Home Game or event at the Premises in an aggregate number that exceeds the Seattle Fire Chief's determined number for the same. The City will not admit to the KeyArena more people than the number so determined by the Seattle Fire Chief. No sidewalk, grounds area, entry, passage, vestibule, hall, elevator, abutting street, doorway, or any other way of access to the Premises shall be obstructed by University or used for any purpose other than for ingress and egress to the Premises.

 F. Firearms:

 Firearms are not allowed at events on City property. In addition, it is the policy of Seattle University to prohibit firearms at University events.

University will further notify staff, players, contractors and coaches of this prohibition prior to the beginning of each Season and will include a printed notice of the prohibition on all event tickets. University will notify security personnel if University becomes aware of any violation of the prohibition against firearms. City shall provide and place signage notifying the public of the prohibition against firearms at all main entrances to the Seattle Center campus and to KeyArena, and shall conduct regular training in implementing the foregoing prohibition for its admission personnel and contract peer group personnel.

 XXIII. CITY'S ACCESS TO PREMISES: INSPECTION, REPAIR, AND IMPROVEMENT OF PREMISES AND OTHER PROPERTY

 A. Access to Premises:

 University will provide the City with access to the Premises at all reasonable times to inspect the same and to make any repair, improvement, alteration or addition thereto or any property owned by or under the control of City, deemed necessary by the Director, but this right of access shall not impose on City any obligation to make any repair, alteration, addition, or improvement except as specifically provided herein.

 B. Permitted Interference with University's Operations:

 In inspecting, and in making repairs, alterations, additions, and improvements, the City may erect barricades and scaffolding in and outside of any Seattle Center facility, and may otherwise interfere with the conduct of University's business and operations where such action is reasonably required by the nature of City's work; and such interference shall not be deemed to be a breach or default under this Agreement. City will use its best efforts to minimize interference with access to and from the Premises and with University's business and operations, in, on or from the Premises.

 C. City's Retention and Use of Keys to Premises:

 The City will have the right to use any and all means that the Director deems proper to obtain entry to the Exclusive Use Area for the purpose of inspection or in an emergency without liability to University except for any failure to exercise due care for University's property. Any entry to the Exclusive Use Area or Premises obtained by the City by any reasonable means shall not be construed or be deemed, under any circumstances, to be a forcible or unlawful entry into, or a detainer of, the Premises, or a termination of University's license to use and occupy the Premises or any portion thereof.

 XXIV. NO NUISANCES OR OBJECTIONABLE ACTIVITY

 University will not knowingly permit any excessive or objectionable noise, odor, dust, vibration, or other similar substance or condition to remain on or be emitted from the Premises; will not create any nuisance in or adjacent to the Premises provided, that noise emanating from the audience or game-related events during a Home Game shall not be subject to this provision. University will not do anything on or around the Premises that will create a danger to life or limb, except such dangers as are the necessary result of basketball playing or practicing.

 XXV. NO SUBCONTRACTING, ASSIGNING, OR TRANSFER

 University will not subcontract, assign or otherwise transfer to another person or entity any of its rights or responsibilities under this Agreement without the Approval of the Director, except that University may subcontract with other parties for the sale of Temporary Advertising or Novelties. The City may terminate this Agreement if University assigns or transfers without Director's Approval. Additionally, if University assigns, transfers, or subcontracts its rights and obligations under this Agreement, whether with or without the Director's consent, University will not be released or relieved from any of its obligations under this Agreement unless the Director expressly releases University in writing. Any assignment, subcontract, or transfer will be subject to all the terms and provisions of this Agreement. In the event of any assignment of this Agreement, University will deliver to the Director, simultaneously with such assignment or transfer, an instrument, in writing, executed by the assignee or transferee, in which the assignee or transferee assumes all terms and provisions of this Agreement and commits to perform all of University's obligations under this Agreement, including those that have not been fully performed previously.

 XXVI. RELATIONSHIP WITH NCAA

 A. Warranty and Special Covenant:

 University hereby warrants, to the best of its knowledge, as follows:

 1. University is authorized to operate a NCAA basketball team in and from the Premises; and

 2. No rule, regulation, policy, constitution or bylaw (or any provision of any thereof) of the NCAA prohibits, limits or affects in any manner or respect the right or power of University to enter into, accept, or perform each and every one of the terms, commitments and provisions of this Agreement.

 B. NCAA and Conference Rules and Regulations:

 The parties recognize that University is subject to and solely responsible for compliance with the rules, regulations, policies, constitutions, and bylaws of the NCAA and any successor Division I Athletics Conferences which University may join. In the event the NCAA or Division I Athletics Conference, amends or enacts rules, regulations, policies, constitutions, and bylaws, University may request that the Director modify or amend this Agreement in order to satisfy University's compliance requirements. The Director will not unreasonably refuse to modify or amend this Agreement.

 XXVII. IMPROVEMENTS, ADDITIONS, AND ALTERATIONS TO PREMISES

 A. Improvements By City:

 Upon execution of this Agreement, the City will paint and re-carpet Room #E14D1 of the Premises and any additional work agreed to by the parties under the procedures in this Section XXVII ("Initial Improvements"). After completion of the Initial Improvements, the City will thereafter maintain the space in a neat, clean, safe and sanitary condition and in a good state of repair. University will submit to the Director, for Approval, drawings and/or specifications for any and all Initial Improvements desired by University for the operation of University's business. No construction or installation of any Initial Improvement, addition, or alteration on the Premises shall be started for University until after the Director has Approved the same.

 B. No Representation or Liability Created by Approval:

 The Approval by the Director of University's drawings and specifications for improvements to the Premises shall not constitute an opinion or representation by City as to their compliance with any law or ordinance or their adequacy for other than the Seattle Center Department's own purposes; and such Approval shall not create or form the basis of any liability on the part of City or any of its officers, employees, or agents for any injury or damage resulting from any inadequacy or error therein or any failure to comply with applicable laws or ordinances.

 C. Cost Limits and Payment for Work:

 The parties will agree on the total cost and scope of the Initial Improvements including labor, materials, and City project management time. The City shall pay one half of the total cost of the Initial Improvements up to a maximum of ten thousand dollars ($10,000) and University shall pay the remaining balance. The City will provide University with an itemized report and invoice detailing all expenses related to the Initial Improvements.

 D. Extra Charges:

 In the event any improvement made or desired to be made by University requires or would require any change in any facility, utility or service provided by City, University shall pay, as an additional charge, any costs incurred by City in making such change or otherwise in connection therewith.

 E. Improvements, Additions, and Alterations Become City Property:

 All Initial Improvements made to the Premises by or for University will become the property of City upon the expiration or termination of the Term, whichever is earlier, and will remain in, and be surrendered with the Premises, as a part thereof at that time without molestation, disturbance, or injury. University's trade fixtures and equipment will remain the property of University and may be removed by University upon the expiration or earlier termination of the Term hereof.

 F. Additional Improvements and Alterations:

 University will not make any improvements or alterations to the Premises without the Approval of the Director, which may be conditioned or withheld in the Director's sole discretion.

 XXVIII. DAMAGE AND DESTRUCTION

 A. Notice:

 University will submit a written notice to the Director regarding the circumstances of any damage or destruction to the Premises within forty-eight (48) hours after University becomes aware of any such damage or destruction.

 B. Suspension of Obligation to Pay Fees and Charges in Event of Unusability of Premises:

 In the event that fire or other casualty not occasioned by any act or omission of University destroys or damages the Premises so extensively as to render it unusable for NCAA Division I basketball purposes, and University has given notice thereof to City as provided in this Section, University's obligation to pay fees and charges, and provide additional consideration, for the use of such Premises will be suspended until the Premises are made usable for University's purposes; but in the event that only a portion of such Premises is destroyed or damaged and not to an extent that would prevent the playing and viewing of NCAA Division I basketball, then the fees and charges payable pursuant to this Agreement, will be prorated, and University will pay only an amount that is proportionate to the extent the Premises remain usable for the purposes intended.

 C. Termination of Agreement upon City's Determination Not to Rebuild KeyArena:

 If KeyArena is destroyed by fire or other casualty during the Term of this Agreement, or the facility is damaged so extensively as to render it unusable for the playing, exhibition, and viewing of a Home Game, the City reserves the right to determine not to rebuild or repair the facility, whether or not adequate insurance proceeds are available, the City may terminate this Agreement.

 D. Notice of Termination:

 Any notice of termination pursuant to this Section shall be provided within one hundred twenty (120) days after the occurrence of the damage or destruction and shall specify the effective date of such termination.

 E. No Liability for Termination:

 The City will not be liable to University for terminating this Agreement as provided in this Section.

 F. University's Damage of Premises:

 Neither University nor any of its officers, employees, contractors, agents or invitees will damage or in any manner deface any portion of the Premises or cause or allow anything to be done whereby any portion of the Premises is defaced or damaged in any manner. University will take reasonable precautions to prevent persons admitted to the Premises from damaging or defacing the same. If any portion of the Premises is damaged or defaced by the act or omission of University or any of its officers, employees, contractors or agents, including but not limited to University's failing to take reasonable precautions to prevent or avoid such damage or defacement, the City will repair or replace the damaged element of the Premises or arrange for its repair or replacement and University will pay the City such sum as is necessary to restore that damaged portion of the Premises to the same condition it had immediately prior to the damage or defacement, which sum will be paid as an Additional Expense.

 XXIX. FORCE MAJEURE

 Whenever a party's performance of any obligation under this Agreement is prevented by an event of Force Majeure, the performance of the affected obligation will be suspended, but only for so long as performance remains beyond the reasonable control of the obligated party. As used in this Section, "Force Majeure" means an act of nature; war or war like operation; civil commotion; riot; labor disputes, including a strike or walk-out; sabotage; or governmental regulation or control.

 XXX. CITY OBLIGATIONS IN EVENT OF REDEVELOPMENT

 The City reserves the right to redevelop, amend, alter, or re- construct KeyArena during the Term of this Agreement. The City will keep University reasonably informed of the City's efforts to redevelop KeyArena or efforts to have an NBA or NHL team as a tenant at KeyArena. The parties acknowledge that it is not feasible to redevelop KeyArena without impact on University, and University expressly acknowledges that the Premises may be unavailable for a portion of the Term as a result of redevelopment. In the event of redevelopment, the City will use its best efforts to minimize negative financial and operational impacts of renovation and construction projects on University, subject to the City's other financial and policy considerations and will endeavor to provide University with one year's notice of redevelopment plans so that University may arrange for an alternative facility to play its basketball games. For any complete Season that KeyArena is unavailable to University due to redevelopment, the City will pay University, as University's sole remedy, the amount by which its net revenue from advertising, ticket sales, and novelty sales compared to the prior complete season at KeyArena, exceeds the amount of net revenue University receives in the season when KeyArena is not available. Any City payment of damages to University resulting from University's loss of revenue during redevelopment shall not exceed Two Hundred and Fifty Thousand Dollars ($250,000).
