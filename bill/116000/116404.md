 AN ORDINANCE relating to tree protection, amending Sections 25.11.020, 25.11.030, 25.11.040, and 25.11.100 of the Seattle Municipal Code to implement interim tree protection regulations.

 WHEREAS, it is in the public interest to maximize the retention of large and exceptional trees as these trees provide considerable benefit to the city in reducing storm water runoff and pollution, absorbing air pollutants, providing wildlife habitat, absorbing carbon dioxide, providing shade, stabilizing soil, and enhancing property value; and

 WHEREAS, the City is aware of ongoing tree removal on sites that are not undergoing development, which is inconsistent with Comprehensive Plan goals concerning no-net loss of tree canopy, tree retention to enhance Seattle's historic, cultural, environmental and aesthetic character, and general land use policies calling for the retention and protection of trees; and

 WHEREAS, the lack of sufficient regulations on sites not undergoing development undermines the long-term goals for tree retention and preservation and encourages tree removal prior to the application of a development permit; and

 WHEREAS, it is necessary for the City to adopt interim regulations that temporarily reduce or limit the removal of certain trees prior to the adoption of permanent regulations that address existing tree removal practices that compromise the City's ability to achieve its stated goals for tree protection; and

 WHEREAS, while the City is currently studying permanent changes to Chapter 25.11, Tree Protection, of the Seattle Municipal Code to implement the City's Urban Forest Management Plan (UFMP), the UFMP has not been completed at the time of this legislation; and

 WHEREAS, the City has legal authority to establish interim measures pursuant to the authority granted by, among other authority, Article 11, Section 11 of the Washington State Constitution, and the Growth Management Act, Chapter 36.70A, RCW; NOW THEREFORE
