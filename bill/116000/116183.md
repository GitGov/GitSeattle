 PSIE Laborers Local 1239

 RE: Utility Construction Worker Apprenticeship

 The parties' signatories hereto agree to establish a Utility Construction Worker Apprenticeship as approved by, and in conformance with, the State of Washington Apprenticeship Council. This apprenticeship is subject to approval by such state council. The parties agree the operations of the program shall conform to the requirements of the City of Seattle Standards of Apprenticeship under the jurisdiction of the Joint Apprenticeship Training Committee (JATC). The parties further agree to have the City establish/create the title of "Utility Construction Worker Apprentice" and with it the appropriate bargained percentage of stepping wage rate, benefits, hours and working conditions.

 The above referenced title and associated wage rate shall become part of the current Collective Bargaining Agreement between the City and Laborers Local 1239 as attached thereto.

 The Utility Construction Apprenticeship shall be an 18 month (3000 hour) apprenticeship with the appropriate related supplemental instruction (RSI) and training provided to complete the program. The beginning wage rate for the first year apprentice shall be 85% of the journey level top step wage rate (as of the signing of this agreement).This will be the rate from 0 hours to 999 hours. From 1,000 hours to 1,999 hours the pay rate shall increase to 87% of the journey level top step wage rate as long as the apprentice has met their requirements of the apprenticeship. From 2,000 hours to 3,000 hours the rate of pay shall be 91% of the top step journey level Utility Construction Worker wage rate, as long as the apprentice has met all their requirements of the apprenticeship. Once the (3000 hours) threshold is reached and the apprentice has met the requirements for an Apprenticeship Certificate of Completion and is considered to have graduated from the apprenticeship program, the apprentice shall receive the top step of the Utility Construction Worker Journey rate. During the program the apprentice will be subject to all general wage rate increases and benefits, afforded the Union, attained during the life of the Collective Bargaining Agreement between the parties.

 The apprentice will be allowed to enjoy the same benefits and conditions of employment that others do listed in the appendix ("J") of the parties' current Collective Bargaining Agreement. Upon expiration of the current agreement between the parties the above referenced title shall become part of the appendix and will be subject to all future negotiations of a subsequent Collective Bargaining Agreement.

 The Parties agree to all of the above by their signatures affixed hereto:

 For the City of Seattle For the Union
