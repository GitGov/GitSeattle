 MEMORANDUM OF UNDERSTANDING by and between THE CITY OF SEATTLE and the INTERNATIONAL ASSOCIATION OF MACHINISTS AND AEROSPACE WORKERS LOCAL 79

 AMENDMENT TO THE COLLECTIVE BARGAINING AGREEMENT THAT WAS EFFECTIVE JANUARY 1, 2006, THROUGH DECEMBER 31, 2008

 This MEMORANDUM OF UNDERSTANDING is supplemental to the AGREEMENT by and between the City of Seattle, hereinafter referred to as the City, and the International Association of Machinists (IAM), Local 79, hereinafter referred to as the Union.

 It is understood and agreed by and between the City and the Union that:

 1. All of the terms and conditions of the Labor Agreement by and between the City and the Union expiring December 31, 2008, shall be extended for the period from January 1, 2009 through December 31, 2011, except as expressly modified herein. The terms of all amending memoranda of understanding and the letters of agreement, which expired as of December 31, 2008, shall also be extended for this period.

 2. The City agrees to pay to its employees, and the Union agrees that its members employed by the City will accept, the wage scales for the various classifications set forth and contained in Schedule "A" of this Memorandum of Understanding. The base wage rates effective on January 7, 2009, as set forth in Schedule "A", attached hereto, reflect a percentage increase of six point two percent (6.2%) above the rates in effect on December 26, 2007. This percentage increase is equal to 100% of the percentage increase in the Seattle-Tacoma- Bremerton area Consumer Price Index for the Urban Wage Earners and Clerical Workers (CPI-W), All Items, Revised Series (1982-84 = 100) as published by the Bureau of Labor Statistics.

 3. The base wage rates effective on January 6, 2010, shall be computed to reflect a percentage increase equivalent to one hundred percent (100%) of the percentage increase in the Seattle-Tacoma-Bremerton area Consumer Price Index for June 2008 over the same index for June 2009; provided, however, said percentage increase shall not be less than two percent (2%) nor shall it exceed seven percent (7%). The index used shall be the Consumer Price Index for Urban Wage Earners and Clerical Workers (CPI-W), All Items, Revised Series (1982-84 = 100), covering the period June 2008 - June 2009 as published by the Bureau of Labor Statistics. The resulting percentage increase shall be rounded to the nearest tenth (10th) of a percent.

 4. The base wage rates effective on January 5, 2011, shall be computed to reflect a percentage increase equivalent to one hundred percent (100%) of the percentage increase in the Seattle-Tacoma-Bremerton area Consumer Price Index for June 2009 over the same index for June 2010; provided, however, said percentage increase shall not be less than two percent (2%) nor shall it exceed seven percent (7%). The index used shall be the Consumer Price Index for Urban Wage Earners and Clerical Workers (CPI-W), All Items, Revised Series (1982-84=100), covering the period June 2009 - June 2010 as published by the Bureau of Labor Statistics. The resulting percentage increase shall be rounded to the nearest tenth (10th) of a percent.

 5. In the event the "Consumer Price Index" becomes unavailable for purposes of computing any one of the afore-referenced increases, the parties shall jointly request the Bureau of Labor Statistics to provide a comparable index for purposes of computing such increase and if that is not satisfactory, the parties shall promptly undertake negotiations solely with respect to agreeing upon a substitute formula for determining a comparable adjustment.

 MEMORANDUM OF UNDERSTANDING

 By and between

 THE CITY OF SEATTLE

 And

 International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers, District Lodge 160, Local Lodge 79

 This Memorandum of Understanding ("MOU") is entered into between the City of Seattle ("City") and the Union ("IAMAW, Local 79") signatory to this MOU Collectively, the City and the Union shall be known as "the Parties."

 The Parties agree to amend their collective bargaining agreement to incorporate the following terms and conditions:

 I. 2010 Furloughs

 1) Scope. All employees who are members of the union signatory to this Agreement shall participate in furloughs, except for certain employees whose job titles and positions the Parties have identified as exceptions. The Parties shall convene a labor-management meeting prior to the first furlough in order to reach agreement on exceptions or alternatives to Schedule A or B.

 Scheduled furlough days may not be cancelled or rescheduled except in the event of an emergency with the approval of the Mayor's Office. If this occurs the employee shall schedule a different furlough day in the same or subsequent pay period in which the furlough occurs on the day before or after their weekend. Work performed on the previously scheduled furlough day shall not be paid overtime except as required by applicable collective bargaining agreement or the FLSA.

 2) Total Furlough Hours. Full-time employees subject to furloughs shall each take a number of unpaid furlough days totaling eighty (80) hours (or a pro-rated equivalent for part-time employees) in 2010.

 3) Scheduling of Furlough Days. Scheduling of furlough days shall be determined by the City on a department or work unit basis, and will be according to operational need. Employees will be assigned furlough dates in 2010 on either Schedule A or Schedule B, as scheduled by their departments, to equal a total of eighty (80) hours (pro-rated for part-time employees). Employees on alternative schedules shall schedule furlough days in order to equal a total of eighty (80) hours (e.g., employees on 4/10s shall take eight (8) furlough days of ten (10) hours each). For employees on alternative work schedules whose regular day off falls on a furlough day, furloughs shall be scheduled during the same payroll week in which the furlough occurs, with the department head's approval.

 4) Leave Accrual. Furlough days will accrue sick leave and vacation time. However, furlough hours may not count towards the hours thresholds used to determine vacation accrual rates. The value of such accrued leave will either be accrued as earned or will be loaded into employees' leave balances by the end of 2010.

 5) Holidays. Furlough hours will not affect employee holiday pay or holiday benefits.

 6) Personal Holidays. Furlough hours will count towards the hours threshold used to determine the number of personal holidays received.

 7) Wage Exemption. Employees whose pay is less than eighteen dollars ($18.00) an hour may opt to use paid vacation, personal holidays, or compensatory time during their absence for a furlough day.

 8) Retirement. The City and employees will not make contributions into the retirement system for furlough days, nor will employees receive service credit for retirement for furlough days.

 An employee assigned to a work group subject to furloughs who plans to retire by December 31, 2012, shall be permitted to use vacation or compensatory time on furlough dates, provided he or she submits a written notice of intent to retire to his or her Human Resources unit no later than December 31, 2010. Should such employee not retire by December 31, 2012, the employee shall return payment for the leave used on furlough days to the City either by pay or deduction of equivalent vacation or compensatory hours.

 9) Health Insurance and Other Benefits. Medical, dental, vision and any other insured benefits coverage shall not be impacted by the furloughs.

 10) Personnel Processes. Furloughs will not count as a break in service and shall not impact seniority, step placement, probationary periods and trial service periods.

 11) Temporary Employees and Volunteers. Temporary employees and volunteers shall not be assigned to perform work to cover the time loss associated with furloughs.

 12) The Parties will use their labor-management committees as a forum for discussion and resolution of implementation issues associated with furloughs.

 II. Contracting Out and Span of Control. The City agrees to convene labor-management meetings with the union signatory to this Agreement to review the City's 2010 budgetary process relating to contracting out and span of control issues. One purpose of the City's review is intended to reduce or eliminate the practice of contracting out of work that can be performed by the City employees to further reduce the need for employee layoffs or reductions of work hours.

 III. Reinstatement and Project Hire. The length of time an employee may remain on the reinstatement list for a position from which he or she was laid off in 2009 or 2010 shall increase from one (1) year to two (2) years. The length of time that an employee may participate in Project Hire for an employee laid off in 2009 or 2010 shall increase from one (1) year to two (2) years.

 IV. Other Terms and Conditions.

 1) The Parties may reopen and negotiate the terms of this MOU by mutual agreement.

 2) To the extent that collective bargaining agreements, City procedures, rules or guidelines conflict with this MOU, this MOU shall prevail.

 3) Any dispute regarding the interpretation and/or application of this MOU shall be addressed pursuant to the terms of the applicable Union's grievance procedure, provided that if more than one Union has the same or similar dispute, the grievances shall be consolidated.

 4) It is the intent of this agreement to mitigate layoffs of Local 79 union members signatory to this agreement.
