A new Section 23.48.017 of the Seattle Municipal Code is adopted to read as follows: 23.48.017 Additional height in certain SM-zoned areas in the South Lake Union Urban Center A. Applicability and General Provisions. Structures designed for research and development laboratory use and administrative office associated with research and development laboratories, shall have a maximum height of 120 feet, provided the project complies with all the requirements of this Section 23.48.017. In order for buildings located on a block subject to this Section 23.48.017 to qualify for the height allowed in this subsection 23.48.017.A, at least one complete MUP application for a structure on the same block that uses the additional height allowed in this subsection 23.48.017.A must be filed within nine months of the effective date of this ordinance.

Due to physical site conditions such as topographic or geologic conditions, parking is permitted in floors that are partially below street level and partially above street level without being separated from the street by other uses, if: a. The street front portion of the parking (excluding garage and loading doors and permitted access to parking) that is at or above street level is screened from view at the street level; and b.

A minimum of 20 percent of the lot area shall be useable open space. The purpose of the open space shall be to allow for public seating, passive recreation, and a mid-block pedestrian connection. For a multi-phase project, the open space requirement and the other requirements in this subsection 23.48.017.H shall be calculated and applied to the total project. The following standards apply to open space required under this subsection 23.48.017.H: 1. The open space shall be open during daylight hours and accessible to the general public, without charge, for a minimum of ten hours per day, except that access may be temporarily limited as required for public safety, security, scheduled events, or maintenance reasons. Members of the public may not be asked to leave for any reason other than conduct that unreasonably interferes with the enjoyment of the space by others, unless the space is closed to the general public consistent with this subsection 23.48.017.H.1. No parking, storage or other use may be established on or above the surface of the open space except as provided in this subsection 23.48.017.H. Use of the open space by motor vehicles is prohibited. The open space shall be clearly identified with signage placed at a visible location at each street entrance providing access to the open space. The signage shall indicate, in letters legible to passersby, the nature of the open space, its availability for general public access, and directional information as needed.  2. The open space shall contain at least one contiguous area with a minimum of 3,000 square feet and a minimum horizontal dimension of 10 feet. 3. A minimum of 35 percent of the open space shall be landscaped with grass, ground cover, bushes and/or trees. 4. Either permanent or movable seating in an amount equivalent to one lineal foot for every 200 square feet of open space shall be available during hours of public access. 5. The open space shall be located and configured to provide easy access from streets or other abutting public spaces and convenient pedestrian circulation through the open space. The open space shall have a minimum frontage of 30 feet at grade abutting a sidewalk, and be visible from sidewalks on at least one street. 6. The open space shall be provided at ground level, except that some separation of multiple levels may be allowed, provided they are physically and visually connected. 7. Up to 20 percent of the open space may be covered by features accessory to public use of the open space, including: permanent, freestanding structures, such as retail kiosks, pavilions, or pedestrian shelters; structural overhangs; overhead arcades or other forms of overhead weather protection; and any other features approved by the Director that contribute to pedestrian comfort and active use of the space. The following features within the open space area may count as open space: areas for temporary kiosks and pavilions, public art, water features, permanent seating that is not reserved for any commercial use, exterior stairs and mechanical assists that provide access to the open space and are available for public use, and any similar features approved by the Director. Seating or tables, or both, may be provided and reserved for customers of restaurants or other uses abutting the open space, however, the area reserved for customer seating shall not exceed 15 percent of the open space area or 500 square feet, whichever is less. 8. Public art shall be included in the public open space. The artwork may include but need not be limited to water features, or two or three-dimensional works in all media. The artwork shall be clearly visible to people using the open space, and, wherever possible, should be visible from the abutting streets. The property owner is responsible for maintaining all art features for the life of the buildings on the lot. I. Transportation Management Program. The Master Use Permit application shall include a Transportation Management Program (TMP) consistent with requirements for TMPs in the applicable Director's Rule. The TMP shall be approved by the Director only if, after consulting with the Director of the Seattle Department of Transportation, the Director determines that no more than 40 percent of trips to and from the project will be made using single-occupant vehicles (SOVs).  1. For purposes of measuring attainment of SOV goals contained in the TMP, the number of SOV trips shall be calculated for the p.m. hour in which an applicant expects the largest number of vehicle trips to be made by employees at the site (the p.m. peak hour of the generator). 2. Compliance with this Section 23.48.017 does not affect the responsibility of any employer to comply with Seattle's Commute Trip Reduction (CTR) Ordinance. J. Energy Management Plan. The Master Use Permit application shall include an energy management plan, approved by the Superintendent of Seattle City Light, containing specific energy conservation or alternative energy generation methods or on-site electrical systems that together can ensure that the existing electrical system can accommodate the projected loads from the project. The Director, after consulting with the Superintendent of Seattle City Light, may condition the approval of the Master Use Permit on the implementation of the energy management plan. Section 3. Section 23.48.017, which section is added by this Council Bill 116665, expires on December 31, 2018. The Council's intent is that the South Lake Union neighborhood plan implementation process that is currently underway may result in Land Use Code and/or Land Use Map amendments. Future development in the neighborhood would be guided by any new amendments. Section 4. Effective Date. Except as otherwise expressly provided, this ordinance shall take effect and be in force thirty (30) days from and after its approval by the Mayor, but if not approved and returned by the Mayor within ten (10) days after presentation, it shall take effect as provided by Municipal Code Section 1.04.020.
