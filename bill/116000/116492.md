 AN ORDINANCE relating to historic preservation, imposing no controls upon the 2315 Western Avenue Building, a landmark designated by the Landmarks Preservation Board (Board), under Chapter 25.12 of the Seattle Municipal Code (SMC).

 WHEREAS, the Landmarks Ordinance, Chapter 25.12 SMC, establishes a procedure for designating and preserving sites, improvements, and objects having historical, cultural, architectural, engineering, or geographic significance; and

 WHEREAS, on December 5, 2007, the Board, after a public meeting, approved the nomination of the exterior of the building at 2315 Western Avenue (the Building), for designation as a landmark under Chapter 25.12 SMC; and

 WHEREAS, on January 16, 2008, the Board, after a public meeting, approved the designation of the exterior of the Building as a landmark based on SMC 25.12.350 D; and

 WHEREAS, the Board and the owner of the Building, Sunrise Investment Company (Sunrise), agreed to negotiate controls and incentives under Chapter 25.12 SMC; and

 WHEREAS, on September 10, 2008, the City's Historic Preservation Officer declared an impasse to the controls and incentives negotiation under SMC 25.12.500; and

 WHEREAS, on September 17, 2008, the Board passed recommended controls and incentives requiring Sunrise to obtain a Certificate of Approval under Chapter 25.12 SMC before making any alteration or significant change to the exterior of the Building; and

 WHEREAS, on October 2, 2008, Sunrise timely filed a Statement of Objections to the Board's recommended controls and incentives with the Hearing Examiner (Examiner), under SMC 25.12.535; and

 WHEREAS, on December 2 and 3, 2008, the Examiner held a public hearing on imposing controls and incentives; and

 WHEREAS, on December 16, 2008, the Examiner concluded that imposing controls would prevent Sunrise from realizing a reasonable return on the Building under SMC 25.12.570 and recommended the City Council not impose controls on the Building; and

 WHEREAS, no appeals of the Examiner's decision were filed with the City Clerk as allowed by SMC 25.12.620.

 NOW, THEREFORE,

 BE IT ORDAINED BY THE CITY OF SEATTLE AS FOLLOWS:

 Section 1. Designation. As provided for in SMC 25.12.660, the City Council acknowledges the Board's designation of the 2315 Western Avenue Building as a City of Seattle landmark. As provided below, however, the Building is not subject to landmark controls.

 A. Legal Description. As provided for in SMC 25.12.660 A.1., the legal description of the property is: Lot 10, Block 29, a Plat of the First Addition to that part of the town of Seattle laid off by Wm. N. Bell and A. A. Denny (commonly known as Bell & Denny's 1st Addition to the City of Seattle), according to the Plat recorded in Volume 1 of the Plats, Page 61, in King County, Washington.

 B. Specific Features and/or Characteristics Designated. As provided for in SMC 25.12.660 A.2., the exterior of the building is the specific feature or characteristic that the Board designated.
