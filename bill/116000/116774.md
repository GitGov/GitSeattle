F. Special Exception to Size-of-Use Limits for Reuse of Certain Buildings.

1. Special Exception to Size-of-Use Limits. If a building meets all of the conditions in subsection 23.50.027.F.2, then pursuant to the procedures in Chapter 23.76, the Director may grant a special exception to the size limits in Table A for 23.50.027 for one or more uses in that building and any other buildings on the lot, based upon the criteria in subsection 23.50.027.F.3.

2. Eligible Buildings. To be eligible for the special exception, the building shall meet the following conditions:  a. The building is located within the following boundaries: north of Lander St., west of Interstate 5, south of Royal Brougham Way, and east of State Route 99;

 b. The building has a minimum of five stories that are entirely or partially above grade;

 c. The building was built and occupied prior to January 1, 2009; and

 d. The lot on which the building is located is at least 0.5 mile from any other lot where a special exception under this subsection 23.50.027.F has been granted.

3. Special Exception Criteria. The Director may grant the special exception when all of the following are met:  a. At least 75 percent of the building that iseligible under subsection 23.50.027.F.2, existing as of January 1, 2009, remains intact after reuse, except to the extent structural alterations are necessary to comply with other applicable codes;

b. The proposed use will not directly or indirectly lead to changes in traffic volumes, traffic patterns or right-of-way improvements that would interfere with adjacent industrial uses, such as by impeding freight access and freight movement; and  c. The proposed use will not contribute to a pattern or density of non-industrial uses to an extent that will conflict with the viability of industrial uses or development on adjacent industrially zoned property.

 4. Exception in Addition to Size of Use Limits. Unless the Director expressly specifies otherwise, any space allowed to be occupied under this special exception is in addition to the amounts allowed by the size of use limits in Table A for 23.50.027 that otherwise apply to a lot or business establishment.

 5. Conditioning Authority. The Director may impose conditions to assure that criteria for the special exception are satisfied and to mitigate any impacts that may result from granting the special exception.

 Section 2. Subsection B of Section 23.74.010 of the Seattle Municipal Code, which section was last amended by Ordinance 123046, is amended as follows:

 23.74.010 Development standards

 * * *

 B. For the areas marked on Map A for 23.74.010, the following development standards and provisions apply to all uses and structures except for spectator sports facilities:

 1. Floor Area Ratio (FAR). The maximum FAR for all uses is 3.0. FAR limits of the underlying zone do not apply, but limits in ~~S~~subsection 23~~7~~.50.027.A.1 on gross floor area of certain uses, including limits based on lot area, do apply.

 2. Exemptions. The first 75,000 square feet of street-level general sales and service, medical services, animal shelters or kennels, automotive sales and services, marine sales and services, eating and drinking establishments, or lodging uses on any lot are exempt from the maximum FAR limit.
