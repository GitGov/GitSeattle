 WHEREAS, the Attorney General of the State of Washington reached a legal settlement with the Enron Corporation in 2005 over the cost to Washington ratepayers of Enron's manipulation of energy markets in 2000 and 2001, and subsequently determined that the settlement funds will be used to support residential low-income energy assistance or low-income residential weatherization; and

 WHEREAS, the City Light Department has received $793,539 from the Washington State Attorney General's office, relating to the settlement from the Enron Corporation, because City Light customers were impacted by the 2000-2001 energy crisis rate increase, and intends to apply the funds to certain residential accounts via low-income program(s); NOW, THEREFORE,
