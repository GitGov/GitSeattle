 CHAPTER 93

 MINIMUM STANDARDS FOR HIGH-RISE BUILDINGS

 Chapter 93 Point of Information

 The requirements of this Chapter originated in City of Seattle Ordinance 110299, effective January 23, 1982. Where used in this Chapter, the term "Building Code" shall mean the 1982 Seattle Building Code. Where used in this Chapter, the terms "this Code" and "the fire code" shall mean the 1982 Seattle Fire Code.

 SECTION 9301

 GENERAL

 9301.1 Purpose. The main purpose of this chapter is to improve the fire and life safety of existing high-rise buildings that do not conform to current City codes so that the health, safety and welfare of the general public is provided for and promoted. It is recognized that the application of present day fire protection techniques to some existing high-rise buildings is difficult. For this reason, this chapter may permit the use of alternative methods and innovative approaches and techniques to achieve its purpose, if approved by the fire code official and the Building Official.

 9301.2 Scope. This chapter applies to all high-rise buildings in existence at the time of its adoption, as well as to all high-rise buildings coming into existence after the adoption thereof.

 9301.2.1 Hazards and design features. If the fire code official finds a condition in a high-rise building not specifically addressed in this chapter, which in the fire code official's opinion makes fire escape or fire fighting unusually difficult, the fire code official is authorized to declare it to be a hazard, notify the owner of such condition and order its correction in a manner consistent with these minimum safeguards.

 9301.2.2 Exempt Buildings. The fire code official and the Director of the Department of Planning and Development may exempt high-rise buildings that meet the requirements of Section 403 of the 1982 Seattle Building Code from complying with the provisions of this chapter.

 9301.2.3 Conflicts. If there is a conflict between the provisions of this chapter and the provisions of an ordinance or code adopted after January 23, 1982, the provisions of the later adopted ordinance or code apply.

 9301.3 Definitions. For the purpose of this chapter, certain words shall be construed as specified in this section.

 CENTRAL STATION: A fire alarm reporting service listed by the Underwriters Laboratories or authorized by the fire code official to report alarms to the Seattle Fire Department Alarm Center. In lieu of connection to a central station listed by Underwriters Laboratories, the fire code official may approve building staff monitoring of a fire alarm annunciator panel if:

 1. Such staff are properly trained to monitor the annunciator panel and report alarm signals to the fire department alarm center via the 9-1-1 system.

 2. One or more building staff is on duty 24 hours a day and remains in the direct vicinity of the annunciator panel, e.g., a hotel desk clerk if the panel is behind the registration desk.

 3. Staff persons are available in low income high-rise buildings whose primary duty requires them to be at the front desk.

 DEAD-END CORRIDOR: A corridor that permits only one direction of travel from a unit or normally occupied room door to an exit, or that intersects an exit corridor on one end and does not provide an exit path on the other end. A corridor that has fire escapes directly accessible from it is not a dead-end corridor.

 FLOOR USED FOR HUMAN OCCUPANCY: A floor designed and intended for occupancy by one or more persons for any part of a day, including a roof garden and an active storage area. An area that is permanently unoccupied or is occupied for the service of building equipment only is not included in this definition.

 HIGH-RISE BUILDING: Buildings having floors used for human occupancy located more than 75 feet above the lowest level of fire department vehicle access.

 LOW INCOME RESIDENTIAL BUILDINGS: Those buildings that meet the following requirements:

 1. At least 50 percent of the dwelling or housing units as defined in the Seattle Housing and Building Maintenance Code (Seattle Municipal Code Ch. 22.204) are rented to non- transient persons at a rent at or below .9% of the current median income for all families in the Seattle area as determined by the United States Department of Housing and Urban Development; and

 2. The average monthly rent for all dwelling or housing units in the building does not exceed 1.4% of the Median Income Limit.

 For purposes of calculating the average monthly rent, a room that is rented on a hostel-style basis to three or more non- related persons is considered as one room rented for $200 per month.

 Monthly rent includes all charges for shelter and provision of items normally associated with such use, but does not include board, health care, telephone charges and other such items.

 SECTION 9302

 EXITS

 9302.1 General. All exits in high-rise buildings shall be illuminated as required in Section 1211 of this Code and enclosed with a minimum of one-hour fire resistive construction. Every high-rise building shall have at least one such exit. If existing exterior fire escapes are used for additional exits, they shall be tested and identified as required in Section 9302.3.

 9302.2 Smokeproof enclosure. Where a high-rise building has a single, enclosed exit, the enclosure shall be continued to the exterior of the building, the exit shall be smoke-proof by mechanical ventilation in accordance with Section 3310 of the 1982 Seattle Building Code, or mechanically pressurized with fresh air to 0.15 inches water column and shall have a concurrent 2500 cubic feet per minute (CFM) exhaust to atmosphere in an emergency, in accordance with the provisions of the Building Code.

 Exceptions:

 1. Pressurization may be omitted if the building has an approved automatic sprinkler system, all corridor openings are self-closing, all occupied areas have access to a second means of egress or a fire escape and the omission is approved by the fire code official.

 2. A single stair may exit through a building lobby, if the lobby is of non-combustible construction, does not contain combustible furnishings, and is separated from the rest of the building by one-hour fire-resistive construction. Wire-glass protected by sprinklers on both sides may be accepted as one-hour fire-resistive construction. If the lobby contains no combustible materials, wire-glass need only be protected by sprinklers on the side opposite the lobby.

 9302.3 Fire Escapes. Exterior fire escapes shall be accessible and structurally safe at all times. Owners of high-rise buildings shall load test fire escapes at least once every five years with a weight of not less than 100 lb/sq. foot. The results of such a load test shall be submitted in writing to the fire code official. In lieu of such a test, the fire code official may accept the opinion of a structural engineer licensed by the State of Washington describing his inspection and/or tests and stating that the fire escape is structurally safe and will support a load of 100 lb/sq. foot. There shall be signs approved by the fire code official clearly identifying the route of access to the fire escape from every public corridor. Fire escapes that are not maintained structurally safe and not otherwise required by provisions of the Fire Code shall be removed. Locked doors or windows are prohibited between public corridors and fire escapes.

 Exceptions: If all of the following criteria are met and approved by the fire code official:

 1. An identified tool or device for opening the locked door or window is permanently affixed in close proximity to the locked point.

 2. The area around the locked door or window is served by emergency illumination.

 3. Clearly understandable directions indicating the use of the tool and the route to the fire escape are posted at the locked door or window.

 9302.4 Doors. All exit doors in the path of exit travel shall be self-closing or automatic closing in accordance with Section 713.6 of the 1982 Building Code. Doors held open by fusible links, and sliding or vertical doors are prohibited in exit-ways. Stairway doors shall be self-latching.

 9302.5 Unlocking of doors. Stairway doors, including the doors between any stairway and the roof, shall not have locks or shall unlock automatically whenever a fire alarm is activated in the high-rise building. Such locks shall unlock automatically when power is off (fail safe). If the only locked door in a stair shaft is the one that leads to the roof, it may be locked by panic hardware or approved alarm lock-paddle bars.

 9302.6 Egress from stairways. Enclosed stairways serving more than six floors shall have two means of egress from the stairway. Enclosed stairways serving ten or more floors shall have re-entry into the building at approximately 5-story intervals. Re-entry signs shall be posted in the stair.

 Exceptions:

 1. Jails.

 2. If telephones connected to a 24-hour manned location are provided in the stairway in each 5-floor increment that does not have a means of egress.

 3. If any door serving as an entrance to the stair does not automatically lock behind a person entering the stair.

 4. If alternate means of alerting building management to persons trapped in a stairwell are approved by the Building Official.

The performance test shall include at minimum a floor plan and the signal strength in various locations of the building. Each owner shall submit a new field performance test report, whenever structural changes occur to the building that would materially change the original field performance tests.

 J103.2.4 Point of Information

 The Department of Planning and Development may not issue a Certificate of Occupancy if the building fails to comply with this section.

 The test procedure shall be conducted as follows:

 1. Each floor of the building shall be divided into a grid of ((~~20~~))  40 approximately equal areas.

 2. ((~~The test shall be conducted using a calibrated portable radio of the latest brand and model used by the agency talking through the agency's radio communications system.~~)) Talk-back testing from a site to the King County Regional 800 MHz Radio System shall use a two watt, portable transceiver with speaker/microphone and flexible antenna. Field strength testing instruments must have been calibrated within one year) of the date of the acceptance test. Field strength testing instruments must be of the frequency selective type incorporating a flexible antenna similar to the ones used on the hand held transceivers.

 The City of Seattle's Radio System Manager may designate alternate methods of measuring the signal level, that satisfy appropriate levels of public safety grade coverage.

 A representative of the Seattle Fire Department will oversee the acceptance test.

 3. A maximum of two nonadjacent areas shall be allowed to fail the test.

 4. In the event that three of the areas fail the test, in order to be more statistically accurate, the floor may be divided into ((~~40~~))  80  equal areas. A maximum of four nonadjacent areas shall be allowed to fail the test. If the system fails the ((~~40~~)) 80  area test, the system shall be altered to meet the 90-percent coverage requirement.

 5. A test location approximately in the center of each grid area shall be selected for the test, then the radio shall be enabled to verify two-way communications to and from the outside of the building through the  King County Regional 800 MHz Radio System  ((~~public agency's radio communications system.~~))Once the test location has been selected, that location shall represent the entire area. If the test fails in the selected test location, that grid area shall fail, and prospecting for a better spot within the grid area shall not be allowed.

 6. The gain values of all amplifiers shall be measured and the test measurement results shall be kept on file with the building owner so that the measurements can be verified during annual tests. In the event that the measurement results become lost, the building owner shall be required to rerun the acceptance test to reestablish the gain values.

 12.5.1.1* The OCC may serve as a proprietary supervising station to allow direct receipt of alarms where approved by the authority having jurisdiction.

 A.12.5.1.1 Expanding the OCC functions to be a proprietary supervising station will allow faster and more coordinated control and monitoring of the various fire and life safety systems. This will expedite emergency functioning by eliminating delays from a central supervising station company. A proprietary station has significant requirements under NFPA 72 that should be fully understood before adopting this as a policy and practice.

 12.5.1.2 For the OCC to be a proprietary supervising station, it shall meet the relevant requirements of NFPA 72.
