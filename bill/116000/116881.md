 WHEREAS, it is in the City's best interest to fund and continue implementation of the Mercer Corridor Project at this time because this project will create over one thousand jobs during the construction phase and will provide critical infrastructure improvements to serve the growing South Lake Union economic hub; and

 WHEREAS, previous versions of the Mercer Corridor Project finance plan included an unsecured funding gap anticipated from state and federal sources and private participation; and

 WHEREAS, the City Council passed Ordinance 122953 in April 2009 with the intent of considering future appropriation authority for the Mercer Corridor Project in the context of whether substantial progress has been made toward closing the funding gap in the project; and

 WHEREAS, the City's 2010 Adopted Budget includes an appropriation of $22,564,000 for the Seattle Department of Transportation (SDOT) Mercer Corridor Project with a proviso restricting spending on construction until authorized by a future ordinance; and

 WHEREAS, the Third Quarter 2009 Supplemental Budget Ordinance, Ordinance 123175, includes an appropriation of $12,275,000 for the Seattle Department of Transportation (SDOT) Mercer Corridor Project with a proviso restricting spending on construction until authorized by a future ordinance; and

 WHEREAS, the First Quarter 2009 Supplemental Budget Ordinance, Ordinance 123006, imposes provisos on the 2008 and 2009 appropriations for Seattle City Light's (SCL) Mercer Corridor Relocations project restricting spending until authorized by a future ordinance; and

 WHEREAS, the environmental documentation for the Mercer Corridor Project is complete and the Federal Highway Administration issued a Finding of No Significant Impact (FONSI) on May 12, 2009; and

 WHEREAS, the City has secured a total of $31.4 million in private contributions for the project, including direct cash contributions of $16.2 million, temporary construction easements valued at $8.8 million, and environmental mitigation fees totaling $6.4 million; and

 WHEREAS, the Mercer Corridor Project has been awarded a total of $39 million in federal funding since the adoption of Ordinance 122953, including $9 Million in Federal Highway Administration Surface Transportation Program funds allocated through the Puget Sound Regional Council and $30 Million in American Reinvestment and Recovery Act funds allocated through the Transportation Investment Generating Economic Recovery (TIGER) program; and

 WHEREAS, major project savings and proceeds from the future disposition of surplus property and right-of-ways in the amount of $35.7 million close the funding gap for the project; and

 WHEREAS, the Mercer Corridor Project is fully funded and its environmental review has been completed; NOW, THEREFORE,
