 AN ORDINANCE eliminating the Engineering Services Fund; providing for the disposition of its assets and liabilities; amending Ordinance 116441 as amended by Ordinance 120537; and, amending Chapter 5.76 of the Municipal Code in connection therewith.

 WHEREAS, the Engineering Services Fund (ESF) captures revenues and expenditures for work related to the Seattle Public Utilities' (SPU's) Geographical Information System (GIS), as well as for SPU's technical, engineering, and construction management services related to capital improvement projects; and

 WHEREAS, when SPU was created in 1997, it assumed responsibility for the management of the ESF, which had an existing deficit; and

 WHEREAS, a multi-year ESF repayment plan was established to address the Fund's deficit by placing a surcharge on engineering work performed by SPU for other City Departments and agencies until 2004, when the surcharge was expanded to also apply to work performed internally within SPU; and

 WHEREAS, the ESF's deficit has been reduced to such a level that it can be paid off in full with one final payment by those entities that use its services; and

 WHEREAS, once the Fund's deficit is paid in full, the ESF can be eliminated to simplify SPU's fund structure and streamline its financial accounting; and

 WHEREAS, the Drainage and Wastewater Fund can replace the ESF with no financial impact to drainage and wastewater rate payers; NOW, THEREFORE,

 BE IT ORDAINED BY THE CITY OF SEATTLE AS FOLLOWS:
