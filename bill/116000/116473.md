 AN ORDINANCE relating to Seattle Public Utilities; authorizing the Director of Seattle Public Utilities to accept the donation of real property via quitclaim deed as settlement of a lawsuit concerning ownership of the real property known as King County Parcel No. 032208-9026 and legally described and depicted in Attachments 1 and 2 hereto.

 WHEREAS, since 1880, it has been the official policy of the City of Seattle to own all lands within the 90,000 acre Cedar River Watershed; and

 WHEREAS, in 2007, Davis Land Group, LLC brought suit against the City claiming that it owns approximately 3.14 acres of the land on which the City's Cedar River Watershed Education Center is located based on a 2006 quitclaim deed purchased by Davis for $1,300; and

 WHEREAS, for much of the period between the 1880s and the present, railroad uses and private and public timber uses within this Watershed have resulted in a complex patchwork of real property purchases, trades and sales among the various ownership rights also involving the City, making the tracking of exact title rights difficult; and

 WHEREAS, in the 1970s, railroad operations within the Watershed ceased and in the 1980s the railroad companies removed all railroad tracks and other equipment; and

 WHEREAS, from and after that time, the City has possessed and controlled the area, gating and fencing the same and posting signs identifying the land as property owned by the City, removing old railroad housing sites and remediating contaminated soil; and

 WHEREAS, in 1992 the City began the Master Plan process for the future of the Watershed, including the development and construction of the land on which the Education Center is now located; and

 WHEREAS, in 1996 the City obtained a title report that expressly represented to the City that the property selected for the Center is owned by the City, but has subsequently learned that the report was in error; and

 WHEREAS, it is the belief of the City and Seattle Public Utilities that it now owns the subject property or that it has acquired all right title and interest therein by virtue of adverse possession; and

 WHEREAS, Davis has offered to settle and dismiss its lawsuit and to donate its bare legal title to any interest in the land to the City in exchange for the City accepting the donation and signing an IRS form (Attachment 3) acknowledging the fact of donation; and

 WHEREAS, the opinion of the Seattle City Attorney, this offer will resolve the suit in an acceptable manner, will cost the City no money, removes any cloud to the City's title to the property and does not require further litigation to establish legal ownership, and the City Attorney has therefore recommended that this settlement offer be accepted; and

 WHEREAS, the authority to accept donations and to accept and record deeds is vested in the Seattle City Council;

 NOW, THEREFORE,

 BE IT ORDAINED BY THE CITY OF SEATTLE AS FOLLOWS:

 Section 1. The Director of Seattle Public Utilities, or designee, is authorized to accept for and on behalf of the City of Seattle a Statutory Warranty Deed donating to the City any right, title, or interest Davis may have in the subject real property described in Attachments 1 and 2 and to execute on behalf of the City an IRS donation receipt form attached as Attachment 3.

 Section 2. This ordinance shall take effect and be in force thirty (30) days from and after its approval by the Mayor, but if not approved and returned by the Mayor within ten (10) days after presentation, it shall take effect as provided by Municipal Code Section 1.04.020.
