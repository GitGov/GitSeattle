 AN ORDINANCE relating to the City Light Department; authorizing the execution of additional agreements necessary or convenient to effectively manage the Department's existing transmission capacity rights in order to facilitate efficient and economical delivery of energy resources, including without limitation, amendments and extensions to existing point- to-point transmission service agreements.

 WHEREAS, under terms generally consistent with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission's ("FERC") pro forma Open Access Transmission Tariff ("OATT"), City Light has previously executed with several transmission service providers, including Bonneville Power Administration, PacifiCorp, Idaho Power Company and Avista Corporation (each an "OATT Transmission Service Provider"), point-to-point transmission service agreements ("PTP Agreements") to deliver power from City Light's owned and purchased energy resources; and

 WHEREAS, each OATT Transmission Service Provider provides transmission service pursuant to an individual OATT, approved by FERC, which it updates from time to time to conform the terms of such OATT to FERC's revised pro forma OATT; and

 WHEREAS, each of City Light's PTP Agreements includes various provisions, guided by its underlying OATT, that enable City Light to manage its transmission capacity rights under such PTP Agreement by entering into additional related agreements with the same OATT Transmission Service Provider to change or redirect the locations of power injections or withdrawals, participate in capacity assessment studies, secure ancillary services necessary to ensure safe and reliable system operation and exercise rollover (i.e., extension) rights in order to maintain such rights as long as City Light needs them; and

 WHERAS, City Light may from time to time under its PTP Agreements have rights to transmission capacity or other transmission services that are surplus to its needs and may wish to assign or sell such rights as permitted under the related OATTs in order to fully utilize the benefits of such agreements; and

 WHEREAS, an OATT may limit the period of time that the OATT Transmission Service Provider may offer such amendments, extensions and additional agreements to its transmission customer; and

 WHEREAS, City Light may need to promptly execute amendments, extensions and additional agreements offered by its OATT Transmission Service Providers in order to ensure that City Light can meet its load service obligations and/or dispose of surplus power in the most efficient and economical manner; NOW, THEREFORE,

 BE IT ORDAINED BY THE CITY OF SEATTLE AS FOLLOWS:

 Section 1. The Superintendent of the City Light Department, or his designee, is hereby authorized to execute for and on behalf of the City of Seattle additional agreements with its existing OATT Transmission Service Providers, other utilities, and transmission-related service providers that are necessary or convenient to effectively manage City Light's existing transmission capacity rights on terms and conditions that the Superintendent deems in the best interests of City Light, including without limitation amendments and extensions of City Light's existing PTP Agreements; provided that such amendments, extensions and additional agreements will not cause City Light to exceed its then current budget authority. Such amendments, extensions and additional agreements may pertain to, but are not limited to, changing or redirecting transmission service to new points of delivery and/or points of receipt, participation in system impact and facilities studies, securing ancillary services, rolling over firm transmission rights and reassigning or remarketing any surplus transmission services as may become available from time to time.

 Section 2. This ordinance shall take effect and be in force thirty (30) days from and after its approval by the Mayor, but if not approved and returned by the Mayor within ten (10) days after presentation, it shall take effect as provided by Municipal Code Section 1.04.020.
