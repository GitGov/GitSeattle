 AN ORDINANCE implementing a court order regarding the City Light Department's funding of a greenhouse gas offset program; transferring cash from the General Subfund to reimburse the Light Fund for expenditures under the offset program.

 WHEREAS, the City Light Department implemented a program in which it received credit for reducing its own greenhouse gas ("GHG") emissions by paying other entities to reduce their GHG emissions (the "GHG Offset Program"); and

 WHEREAS, in Okeson v. City of Seattle, 159 Wash.2d 436, 150 P.3d 556 (2007) ("Okeson"), the Washington Supreme Court held that the GHG Offset Program was not an authorized use of electric utility revenues and must be paid for by the general taxpayers; and

 WHEREAS, state legislation subsequently was enacted that authorizes electric utilities to enter into GHG offset contracts; and

 WHEREAS, consistent with the Okeson decision, on September 4, 2007 the trial court entered a stipulation and agreed judgment under which the General Subfund is to reimburse the Light Fund for GHG Offset Program-related expenditures incurred prior to the change in state law; NOW, THEREFORE,

 BE IT ORDAINED BY THE CITY OF SEATTLE AS FOLLOWS:

 Section 1. In order to comply with the September 4, 2007 judgment, cash is hereby transferred from the General Subfund (00100) to the Light Fund (41000) in the amount of Two Million One Hundred Fifty Thousand Five Hundred Fifty-eight Dollars ($2,150,558).
