 AN ORDINANCE related to authorizing and collecting fees under the Traffic Code; amending Seattle Municipal Code Section 11.23.420 to authorize curb space parking permits in limited circumstances; amending Section 11.23.440 to allow parking privileges for car sharing activities; amending Section 11.72.054 to clarify which vehicles are authorized to park in car sharing zones; adding a new Section 11.23.150 to codify car sharing permit fees; and amending Sections 11.16.315 and 11.16.319 to establish a maximum limit and a fee for single-day use guest permits for parking in restricted parking zones.

 WHEREAS, in 1979, Ordinance 108354 established the Restricted Parking Zone program [known generally as the Residential Parking Zone (RPZ) program] to help ease parking congestion in residential neighborhoods, and Ordinance 122853 amended the permit fees to cover the increased cost of administration; and

 WHEREAS, RPZs are often located in neighborhoods close to generators of high traffic demand, such as universities, high schools, hospitals, transit stations or stops, and business districts; and

 WHEREAS, the establishment of RPZs in such neighborhoods limits the impact of employees, transit commuters, and students parking their vehicles for lengthy periods of time who use parking that might otherwise be utilized by residents and area visitors; and

 WHEREAS, as of March 2009, Seattle had 27 restricted parking zones and the Seattle Department of Transportation (SDOT) issued approximately 17,000 RPZ permits annually; and

 WHEREAS, SDOT conducted a broad-based community engagement effort regarding the RPZ program and received substantial feedback on draft recommendations issued in August 2008; and

 WHEREAS, during community engagement on the RPZ program, broad support was expressed for a single-day use guest permit to address the difficulties users experience when multiple family members or friends visit at the same time; and

 WHEREAS, car sharing provides an alternative to car ownership and complements the public transportation system; and

 WHEREAS, recent studies indicate that car sharing programs reduce vehicle miles traveled and thus help alleviate traffic congestion; and

 WHEREAS, the City has a finite supply of on-street parking spaces, and shared parking reduces the demand for parking; and

 WHEREAS, the City needs to regulate the use of car share spaces to promote reduced traffic congestion and the increased availability of public parking; and

 WHEREAS, both the City's Transportation Strategic Plan and Climate Action plan promote car sharing; NOW, THEREFORE,

 BE IT ORDAINED BY THE CITY OF SEATTLE AS FOLLOWS:
