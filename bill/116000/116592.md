 AN ORDINANCE repealing Chapter 5.37 of the Seattle Municipal Code (Employee Hours Tax), effective January 1, 2010.

 WHEREAS, in 2005, the City adopted Resolution 30790 approving the Transportation Strategic Plan with key themes of improving safety, preserving and maintaining transportation infrastructure, and providing mobility and access through transportation choices; and

 WHEREAS, the City convened a Citizens Advisory Panel and conducted five public workshops to gather ideas for transportation improvements and the means to fund them; and

 WHEREAS, on August 7, 2006, the City Council passed Ordinance 122191, which created an "employee hours tax" to provide partial funding for transportation improvements; and

 WHEREAS, on the same day, the City Council passed Ordinance 122192, which created a "commercial parking tax" to provide additional funding for transportation improvements; and

 WHEREAS, the employee hours tax has generated less revenue than expected due to the exemptions provided for employers with workers who commute by mass transit, bicycle, or walking, and the tax has been difficult for employers and the City to administer due to the exemptions and the difficulty of tracking employee hours appropriately; and

 WHEREAS, the commercial parking tax has generated more revenue than expected due to the discovery of many parking operators who had not previously been identified as such; and

 WHEREAS, the Mayor and City Council wish to support economic development and especially to encourage job growth in Seattle; and

 WHEREAS, the higher than expected commercial parking tax revenues would largely offset the loss of employee hours tax revenues, allowing important transportation projects to proceed; NOW, THEREFORE,

 BE IT ORDAINED BY THE CITY OF SEATTLE AS FOLLOWS:

 Section 1. Chapter 5.37 of the Seattle Municipal Code (Employee Hours Tax), as last amended by Ordinance 122561, is hereby repealed, effective as of January 1, 2010.

 Section 2. Tax obligations under Chapter 5.37 for 2009 and prior years remain due and payable as scheduled. The effect of this ordinance is prospective only and shall apply to tax liabilities that would have been incurred in 2010 and subsequent years.

 Section 3. This ordinance shall take effect and be in force thirty (30) days from and after its approval by the Mayor, but if not approved and returned by the Mayor within ten (10) days after presentation, it shall take effect as provided by Municipal Code Section 1.04.020.

 Passed by the City Council the ____ day of ________________________, 2009, and signed by me in open session in authentication of its passage this

 _____ day of ___________________, 2009.
