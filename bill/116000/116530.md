 EXHIBIT A:

 CITY OF SEATTLE IDENTITY THEFT PREVENTION PROGRAM

 I. PROGRAM ADOPTION

 The City of Seattle ("City") developed this Identity Theft Prevention Program ("Program") pursuant to the Federal Trade Commission's Red Flag Rule ("Rule"), which implements Section 114 of the Fair and Accurate Credit Transactions Act of 2003. 16 C.F.R. section 681.2. After consideration of the size and complexity of the City's operations and account systems, and the nature and scope of the City's activities, the Director of Executive Administration determined that this Program was appropriate for the City. The City Council approved this Program by the adoption of Ordinance ___________ on the ____ day of _____________, 2009.

 II. PROGRAM PURPOSE AND DEFINITIONS

 A. Fulfilling requirements of the Red Flag Rule

 Under the Red Flag Rule, every financial institution and creditor is required to establish an "Identity Theft Prevention Program" tailored to the size, complexity and nature of its operation. Each program must contain reasonable policies and procedures to:

 1. Identify relevant Red Flags for new and existing covered accounts and incorporate those Red Flags into the Program;

 2. Detect Red Flags that have been incorporated into the Program;

 3. Respond appropriately to any Red Flags that are detected to prevent and mitigate Identity Theft; and

 4. Ensure the Program is updated periodically, to reflect changes in risks to customers or to the safety and soundness of the creditor from Identity Theft.

 B. Red Flags Rule definitions used in this Program

 For the purposes of this Program, the following definitions apply:

 1. "Account" means a continuing relationship established by a person with a financial institution or creditor to obtain a product or service for personal, family, household or business purposes.

 2. "Covered Account" means:

 a. Any account the City offers or maintains primarily for personal, family or household purposes, that involves or is designed to permit multiple payments or transactions; and

 b. Any other account that the City offers or maintains for which there is a reasonably foreseeable risk to customers or to the safety and soundness of the City from identity theft.

 3. "Creditor" has the same meaning as defined in 15 U.S.C. 1691a, and includes a person or entity that arranges for the extension, renewal or continuation of credit, including the City.

 4. "Customer" means a person or business entity that has a covered account with the City.

 5. "Financial Institution" means any entity that holds a transaction account belonging to a customer.

 6. "Identifying Information" means any name or number that may be used, alone or in conjunction with any other information, to identify a specific person, including name, address, telephone number, social security number, date of birth, government-issued driver's license or identification number, alien registration number, government passport number, employer or taxpayer identification number, unique electronic identification number, computer's Internet Protocol address, or routing code.

 7. "Identity Theft" means fraud committed using the identifying information of another person.

 8. "Red Flag" means a pattern, practice, or specific activity that indicates the possible existence of Identity Theft.

 9. "Service Provider" means a person or business entity that provides a service directly to the City relating to or in connection with a covered account.

 III. IDENTIFICATION OF RED FLAGS.

 In order to identify relevant Red Flags, the City considers the types of accounts that it offers and maintains, the methods it provides to open its accounts, the methods it provides to access its accounts, and its previous experiences with Identity Theft. The City identifies the following Red Flags and will train appropriate staff to recognize these Red Flags as they are encountered in the ordinary course of City business:

 A. Suspicious Documents Red Flags

 1. Identification document or card that appears to be forged, altered or inauthentic;

 2. Identification document or card on which a person's photograph or physical description is not consistent with the person presenting the document;

 4. Application for service that appears to have been altered or forged.

 B. Suspicious Personal Identifying Information Red Flags

 1. Identifying information presented that is inconsistent with other information the customer provides;

 2. Identifying information presented that is inconsistent with external sources of information;

 5. Social security number presented that is the same as one given by another customer;

 6. An address or phone number presented that is the same as that of another person;

 7. A person fails to provide complete personal identifying information on an application when reminded to do so (however, by law, social security numbers must not be required); and

 8. A person's identifying information is not consistent with the information that is on file for the customer.

 4. Not open a new account;

 5. Close an existing account;

 6. Reopen an account with a new number;

 7. Notify law enforcement; or

 8. Determine that no response is warranted under the particular circumstances.

 V. PROGRAM UPDATES

 The Director of Executive Administration, or their designee, shall serve as Program Administrator. The Program Administrator shall periodically review and update this Program to reflect changes in risks to customers and the soundness of the City from Identity Theft. In doing so, the Program Administrator shall consider the City's experiences with Identity Theft situations, changes in Identity Theft methods, changes in Identity Theft detection and prevention methods, and changes in the City's business arrangements with other entities. After considering these factors, the Program Administrator will determine whether changes to the Program, including the listing of Red Flags, are warranted. If warranted, the Program Administrator will update the Program or present the City Council with his or her recommended changes and the City Council will make a determination of whether to accept, modify or reject those changes to the Program.

 VI. PROGRAM ADMINISTRATION.

 A. Oversight

 Responsibility for implementing and updating this Program lies with the Program Administrator. The Program Administrator will be responsible for the Program's administration, for ensuring appropriate training of City staff, for reviewing any staff reports regarding the detection of Red Flags and the steps for preventing and mitigating Identity Theft, and for considering periodic changes to the Program.

 B. Staff Training and Reports

 City staff responsible for implementing the Program shall be trained in the detection of Red Flags and the responsive steps to be taken when a Red Flag is detected. Staff should prepare a report at least annually for the Program Administrator, including an evaluation of the effectiveness of the Program with respect to opening accounts, existing covered accounts, service provider arrangements, significant incidents involving identity theft and responses, and recommendations for changes to the Program.

 C. Service Provider Arrangements

 In the event the City engages a service provider to perform an activity in connection with one or more accounts, the City shall take the following steps to ensure the service provider performs its activity in accordance with reasonable policies and procedures designed to detect, prevent, and mitigate the risk of Identity Theft:

 1. Require, by contract, that service providers have such policies and procedures in place; and

 2. Require, by contract, that service providers review the City's Program and report any Red Flags to the Program Administrator.
