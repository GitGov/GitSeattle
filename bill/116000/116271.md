 AN ORDINANCE relating to the drainage system of Seattle Public Utilities ("SPU"); authorizing the acquisition by negotiation or condemnation of land and all improvements thereon and other property rights for properties in the vicinity of Interstate-5 north of the Boeing Access Road, for drainage system, other utility and general municipal purposes.

 WHEREAS, the existing Norfolk Martin Luther King Jr. Way drainage system, located in south Seattle, consisting of pipes, ditches, culverts, stormwater ponds and wetlands that are intended to discharge to the Duwamish Waterway, has significant deficiencies in the conveyance system resulting in inefficient drainage capacity and backflow that is being pumped to the Metro/King County sanitary sewer system; and

 WHEREAS, the proposed drainage system and water quality improvement project requires additional land and property rights to install a temporary pumping system to manage the drainage backflow, to construct permanent improvements to the system and to undertake required wetland mitigation due to alterations to a wetland in the project area; and

 WHEREAS, to complete the project and for ongoing management, additional properties and property rights are needed, including: 1) Temporary Pumping Easements for two years across two properties; 2) Construction Easements for up to four months across four properties to construct the permanent improvements; 3) Permanent Easements for use, maintenance and access to the permanent improvements across three properties; and

 WHEREAS, RCW 8.12.030 and 35.67.020 authorize the City to purchase or condemn property for drainage system, other utility or general municipal purposes; and

 WHEREAS, the City has provided adequate notice to the relevant property owners that the City may take final action to authorize condemnation of the subject properties as required by RCW 8.12 and 8.25; and
