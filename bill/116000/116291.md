 THE CITY OF SEATTLE

 AND

 KING COUNTY

 This Agreement is made and entered into between the City of Seattle, hereinafter "City" and King County regarding the City's 2008 financial contribution to staffing and operational costs for the King County Regional Food Policy Council.

 Section 1. Background

 In 2008, the King County Council established the King County Regional Food Policy Council (KCRFPC) by King County Ordinance [________].

 The KCRFPC serves as an advisory body to the County, the City of Seattle, and other entities in King County to advise on policies, programs or operations to strengthen the local food system with the goals of improving public health, reducing impacts on the environment, supporting vulnerable communities, strengthening the regional economy, protecting and sustaining agricultural lands and increasing the region's food security and emergency preparedness. City of Seattle Resolution [________] will recognize the KCRFPC as an advisory body to the City of Seattle and the City of Seattle will nominate two voting members and appoint one non-voting member to serve on the KCRFPC.

 Section 2. KCRFPC Contributions to the City of Seattle

 The KCRFPC will provide policy advice and recommendations to assist the City of Seattle in identifying and developing policies and programs that will strengthen Seattle's food system sustainability and security as outlined in Resolution 31019 passed by the City in 2008. The KCRFPC will present annual reports to the City Council that will include KCRFPC recommendations on major policies, programs and operations of King County, the City of Seattle, and other entities. The annual reports will include a description of KCRFPC work to a) increase public awareness of the benefits of a strong local food system; b) develop and coordinate policies amongst jurisdictions, c) identify and advocate on state and federal policies that impact the local food system, and d) collaborate with the Agricultural Commission to support the preservation of agricultural land and communities and identify and reduce barriers between farmers and urban consumers.

 Section 3. City of Seattle Contributions to King County for Staffing and Operational Costs of the KCRFPC

 As consideration for the policy advice and recommendations described in Section 2 of this Agreement, the City of Seattle will contribute $24,000 to King County in 2008 as a partial contribution for the staffing and operational costs of the KCRFPC. The City's total contributions under this agreement shall not exceed $24,000.

 Any funding shall be transmitted from the City to King County only after King County establishes, by legislation, the KCRFPC; and the City recognizes, by legislation, the KCRFPC as an advisory body to the City.

 The $24,000 in City funding shall be used by King County solely as a partial contribution for the staffing and operational costs of the KCRFPC. Staff will be hired by the Washington State University Extension, hereinafter WSU, and King County's Interlocal Agreement with WSU will be amended to include this body of work. WSU will fund the benefits for the KCRFPC staff and provide the office space and ancillary office needs.

 King County shall provide the City with a monthly accounting of the staffing and operational costs of the KCRFPC which shall include a description of the use of City contributions made to King County pursuant to this Agreement.

 It is the City's further understanding that King County will also contribute to the staffing and operational costs for the KCRFPC.

 This Agreement defines the City's contribution of $24,000 in 2008. Future financial contributions for staffing and operational costs will be addressed in future legislation and Agreements with King County.

In furtherance of these obligations, and only with respect to the City, its employees and agents, King County waives any immunity it may have or limitation on the amount or type of damages imposed under any industrial insurance, worker's compensation, disability, employee benefit or similar laws. King County acknowledges that the foregoing waiver of immunity was mutually negotiated and agrees that the indemnification provided for in this section shall survive any termination or expiration of this Agreement.
