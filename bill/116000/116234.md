 This project will design and construct an 18,000 foot 26.4 KV overhead service drop from an existing 115 KV transmission line and switchyard at the SCL Powerhouse to the Masonry Dam near Chester Morse Lake. The service drop will be primarily located in an existing right-of-way. The service drop may include direct bury cable. A related project, 7805, Cedar Falls Switchyard Expansion for Morse Lake Pumps, will construct a new switchyard at the Powerhouse to supply the service drop with power.

 The service drop will supply power to new water supply pumps at Chester Morse Lake that Seattle Public Utilities (SPU) will install in their project C103032, Morse Lake Pump Plant. SPU will also construct a customer owned line from the Seattle City Light service drop at the Masonry Dam to the pump location. The new pumps will reliably deliver water during drought conditions.

 For this project, City Light will tap into the 115 KV Rattlesnake Lake Transmission Line owned by Puget Sound Energy and design and construct a new switchyard to supply 26.4 KV power to Seattle Public Utilities. The line tap and switchyard will be primarily located in an existing right-of-way. Transformers specific for this project will need to be ordered and built well in advance of switchyard construction. A related project, 8420, Cedar Falls to Chester Morse Lake Pump Station Line Extension, will result in construction of an 18,000 foot 26.4 KV overhead service drop from the switchyard to the Masonry Dam near Chester Morse Lake.

 These two projects will supply power to new water supply pumps at Chester Morse Lake that Seattle Public Utilities (SPU) will install in their project C103032, Morse Lake Pump Plant. As part of their project, SPU will construct an 18,000-foot customer owned line from the Seattle City Light service drop at the Masonry Dam to the pump location. The new pumps will reliably deliver water during drought conditions.
