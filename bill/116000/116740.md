 AN ORDINANCE establishing a Living Building Pilot Program, amending Sections 23.41.004, 23.41.012, 23.41.014, 23.86.006, and 23.90.018, and adding a new Section 23.40.060 to the Seattle Municipal Code to implement the Pilot Program.

 WHEREAS, the US Green Building Council estimates that, in the United States alone, buildings account for 65% of electricity consumption, 36% of energy use, 30% of all greenhouse gas emissions, 30% of raw materials use, 30% of waste output, and 12% of potable water consumption (usgbc.org, April 27, 2009); and

 WHEREAS, the City's Comprehensive Plan, originally adopted in 1994 and last amended in 2008, includes environmental goals to protect and improve the quality and function of the city's air, land, and water resources; and

 WHEREAS, the City's Comprehensive Plan also states Seattle's intent to reduce our climate change impact, including a goal of reducing emissions of carbon dioxide and other climate-changing greenhouse gases in Seattle from 1990 levels by 30 percent by 2024, and by 80 percent from 1990 levels by 2050; and

 WHEREAS, 1000 cities, including Seattle, have signed the United States Conference of Mayors' Climate Protection Agreement, which calls on cities to take actions in their own communities, including, among others, to reduce sprawl, to advocate for the development of renewable energy resources to increase the use of clean, alternative energy, to improve building codes to make energy efficiency a priority, to evaluate opportunities to increase pump efficiency in water and wastewater systems, and to promote sustainable building practices; and

 WHEREAS, in 2008 the Washington State Legislature passed and the Governor signed ESSB 6001, now codified as RCW 70.235.020, which establishes a goal for the State of Washington to reduce its output of greenhouse gas emissions to 1990 levels by 2020; and

 WHEREAS, the Living Building Challenge is a performance-based rating system developed by the International Living Building Institute to recognize developments that achieve an advanced level of sustainability, given what is currently possible and the best knowledge available today. Projects that achieve this level of performance can claim to be among the 'greenest' anywhere, and will serve as role models to others that follow; and

 WHEREAS, the Living Building Challenge challenges building owners, architects, design professionals, engineers, and contractors to build well-designed, environmentally sound, and self-sustaining buildings that generate all of their own energy with renewable resources, that capture and treat all of the water needed, and that use resources efficiently; and

 WHEREAS, creating a Living Building requires a fundamentally different approach to building design, construction, and operations that may necessitate changes to current development codes; NOW THEREFORE,

 BE IT ORDAINED BY THE CITY OF SEATTLE AS FOLLOWS:

 Section 1. Establishment of Pilot Program. This ordinance establishes the Living Building Pilot Program.

 Section 2. Program Reporting and Evaluation. The Department of Planning and Development (DPD) shall provide the City Council with an annual status report on the Living Building Pilot Program, summarizing the types of projects submitted, types of projects that qualified for participation in the pilot program, and an evaluation of how the proposals have met or are meeting the goals and intent of the Living Building Pilot Program. In order to assess the effectiveness of the Living Building Pilot Program in achieving desired goals, the program shall be evaluated within five years after the effective date of this ordinance, or within 12 months after the first project has been evaluated for its performance against the Living Building Challenge, whichever comes later.

 Section 3. A new Section 23.40.060 is added to the Seattle Municipal Code, as follows:

 23.40.060 Living Building Pilot Program

 A. Purpose. The purpose of this section is to establish a Living Building Pilot Program. The goal of the Pilot Program is to encourage the development of buildings that meet the Living Building Challenge by allowing departures from code requirements that might otherwise discourage or prevent buildings from meeting this standard. Overall, the Living Building Pilot Program is intended to:

 1. stimulate innovative development that meets the goals of the Living Building Challenge and City of Seattle design guidelines.

 2. encourage development that will serve as a model for other projects throughout the City and region and will stimulate development of new Living Buildings.

 3. identify barriers to Living Buildings in current codes and processes.

 B. Project qualification.

 1. Eligible projects. Only projects that are eligible for design review under Section 23.41.004 and located outside of the shoreline jurisdiction may qualify for the Living Building Pilot Program.

 2. Enrollment period. The enrollment period is limited to three years from the effective date of this ordinance or when twelve projects have successfully qualified, whichever comes first.

 3. Application requirements. In order to qualify for the Living Building Pilot Program, applicants must submit a plan demonstrating how their project will meet each of the prerequisites of the Living Building Challenge, including an overall design concept, proposed energy balance, proposed water balance, and descriptions of innovative systems. In addition, an applicant shall include a description of how the project serves as a model for testing code improvements to stimulate and encourage Living Buildings in the city.

 4. Qualification process. An eligible project shall qualify for the Pilot Program upon determination by the Director that it has submitted a complete application pursuant to Section 23.76.010 and has complied with the application requirements in Section 23.40.060.B.3.

 C. Design review. All Living Building Pilot Program projects are subject to Design Review and shall be reviewed in accordance with the Design Review Process provided in Section 23.41.014.

 D. Height measurement technique. At the discretion of the applicant, the height of a qualifying project shall be determined using either the definition of building height in Section 502 of the Seattle Building Code or the method described in Chapter 23.86 of the Land Use Code.

 E. Compliance with minimum standards.

 1. Minimum standards. While the intent of the Living Building Pilot Program is to encourage development of buildings that meet or exceed the goals of the Living Building Challenge, qualifying projects that are granted departures shall meet either all of the prerequisites of the Living Building Challenge or 60 percent of the prerequisites of the Living Building Challenge and all of the following alternative standards:

 a. total building energy usage, subtracting energy generated on site, is 25 percent or less of the average energy usage for a comparable building not in the Living Building Program, based on the Energy Information Administration's 2003 Commercial Buildings Energy Use Survey, Energy Information Administration's 2005 Residential Energy Consumption Survey, or other baseline approved by the Director that would provide a comparable estimate;

 b. total building water usage, subtracting harvested rainwater, is 25 percent or less of the average water usage for a comparable building not in the Living Building Program, based on Seattle Public Utility estimates or other baseline approved by the Director that would provide a comparable estimate; and

 c. at least 50 percent of stormwater is captured and used on site.

 2. No later than two years after issuance of a final Certificate of Occupancy for the project, or such later date as may be allowed by the Director for good cause, the owner shall submit to the Director a report demonstrating how the project has met the Living Building Challenge prerequisites and the standards described in subsection 23.40.006.E.1.

 3. If the Director determines that the report submitted pursuant to subsection 23.40.060.E.2 provides satisfactory evidence that the project has complied with the standards contained in subsection 23.40.060.E.1, the Director shall send the owner a certificate stating that the project has complied with the performance standards of the Living Building Pilot Program. If the Director determines that the project does not comply with the standards in subsection 23.40.060.E.1, the Director shall notify the owner of the aspects in which the project does not comply. Components of the project that are included in order to comply with the minimum standards of this program shall remain for the life of the project.

 4.Within 90 days after the Director notifies the owner of the ways in which the project does not comply, or such longer period as the Director may allow for good cause, the owner may submit a supplemental report demonstrating that it has made alterations or improvements such that the project now meets the standards in subsection 23.40.060.E.1.

 5. If the owner fails to submit a supplemental report within the time allowed pursuant to Section 23.40.060.E.4, the Director shall determine that the project has failed to demonstrate full compliance with the standards contained in Section 23.40.060.E.1, and the owner shall be subject to the penalty in Section 23.90.018.B.6.
