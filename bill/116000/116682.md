 AN ORDINANCE relating to business licenses; amending sections 5.55.030 and 5.55.230 of the Seattle Municipal Code relating to the renewal of business licenses; and adding a new Section 5.55.125 providing for an amnesty program relating to the late payment of business license tax to increase City revenues.

 WHEREAS, a significant number of business licensees that are delinquent in paying licensing fees and taxes owed to the City have been allowed to renew their licenses regardless of such delinquencies; and

 WHEREAS, the City desires to pursue payment of delinquent fees and taxes, while having the ability to refuse to renew business licenses for taxpayers whose obligations to the City are in arrears; and

 WHEREAS, the City wishes to allow for the implementation of a periodic tax amnesty program when it is determined that the offer of amnesty will likely provide increased revenues to the City and encourage delinquent taxpayers to bring their accounts current; NOW, THEREFORE,
