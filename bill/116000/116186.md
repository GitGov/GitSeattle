 PREAMBLE

 This Agreement is between the City of Seattle (hereinafter called the City) and the United Association of Journeymen and Apprentices of the Plumbing and Pipe Fitting Industry, Local 32 (hereinafter called the Union) for the purpose of setting forth the mutual understanding of the parties as to wages, hours, and other conditions of employment of those employees for whom the City has recognized the Union as the exclusive collective bargaining representative.

 ARTICLE 1 -- NON-DISCRIMINATION

 1.1 The City and the Union shall not unlawfully discriminate against any employee by reason of race, creed, age, color, sex, national origin, religious belief, marital status, sexual orientation, political ideology, ancestry or the presence of any sensory, mental or physical disability unless based on a bona fide occupational qualification reasonably necessary to the operations of the City.

 1.1.1 Wherever words denoting a specific gender are used in the Agreement, they are intended and shall be construed so as to apply equally to either gender.

 1.2 Allegations of discrimination shall not be a proper subject for the grievance procedure herein but instead may be filed by a complaint with the appropriate human rights agency.

 ARTICLE 2 -- RECOGNITION, BARGAINING UNIT, AND

 TEMPORARY EMPLOYMENT

 2.1 The City recognizes the Union as the exclusive collective bargaining representative for the purpose stated in Chapter 108, Extra Session Laws of 1967 of the State of Washington for employees employed within the bargaining unit defined in Appendices A and B of this Agreement. For purposes of this Agreement and the bargaining unit described herein the following definitions shall apply:

 2.1.3 The term "apprentice" shall be defined as an employee whose terms and conditions of employment are set forth in an "agreement of apprenticeship" which terms shall govern when they conflict with any terms and conditions herein. Apprenticeship programs are authorized by RCW 49.04 and Seattle Municipal Code Section 4.04.200 B which designates a Joint Advisory Apprenticeship Committee to administer such programs. At the time of the signing of this Agreement, the applicable apprentice title is Water Pipe Worker Apprentice. Other apprentice titles will be included within this definition as they are adopted by the Joint Advisory Committee, approved by the state, adopted by the City Council, and incorporated into this Agreement by an amending Memorandum of Understanding.

 2.1.4 The term "regular employee" shall be defined as an employee who has successfully completed a twelve (12) month probationary period and who has had no subsequent break in service as occasioned by quit, resignation, discharge for just cause, or retirement.

 2.1.5 The term "full-time employee" shall be defined as an employee who has been regularly appointed and who has a usual work schedule of forty (40) hours per week.

 2.1.6 The term "part-time employee" shall be defined as an employee who has been regularly appointed and who has a usual work schedule averaging at least twenty (20) hours but less than forty (40) hours per week.

 2.1.7 The terms temporary employee and temporary worker shall be defined to include both temporary and less than half time employees and means a person who is employed in:

 1. An interim assignment(s) of up to one (1) year to a vacant regular position to perform work associated with a regularly budgeted position that is temporarily vacant and has no incumbent; or

 2. An interim assignment for short-term replacement of a regular employee of up to one (1) year when the incumbent is temporarily absent; or

 3. A short-term assignment of up to one (1) year, which may be extended beyond one year only while the assignment is in the process of being converted to a regular position, to perform work that is not ongoing regular work and for which there is no regularly budgeted position; or

 4. A less than half-time assignment for seasonal, on-call, intermittent or regularly scheduled work that normally does not exceed one thousand forty (1040) hours in a year, but may be extended up to one thousand three hundred (1300) hours once every three years and may also be extended while the assignment is in the process of being converted to a regular position; or

 5. A term-limited assignment for a period of more than one but less than three (3) years for time-limited work related to a specific project, grant or other non-routine substantial body of work, or for the replacement of a regularly appointed employee when that employee is absent on long-term disability time loss, medical or military leave of absence.

 2.1.8 Temporary workers in the following types of assignments shall cease receiving premium pay at the time indicated and begin receiving wage progression and benefits as provided in SMC 4.20.055 D.

 2.1.8.1 Interim and short term assignments after one thousand forty (1,040) regular straight time hours for the remainder of the assignment unless the Personnel Director determines that the assignment will terminate so imminently that the benefits package would be of minimal value to the worker.

 2.1.8.2 Term-limited assignments starting with the first day and for the duration of the assignment.

 2.1.8.3 Any assignment that the appointing authority has proposed be converted to regular position authority regardless of the number of hours worked.

 2.2 Temporary employees shall be exempt from all provisions of this Agreement except Sections 2.2; 2.2.1; 2.2.2; 2.2.2.1; 2.2.2.2; 2.2.3; 2.2.4; 2.2.5 (only applies if Temporary Employees are benefited); 2.2.6; 2.2.7; 2.2.8; 2.2.9; 2.2.10; 2.2.11; 18.1.4; 18.1.4.1; 18.1.4.2; 19.1; Article 4, Union Security, Section 4.1.2 and Article 5, Grievance Procedure; provided however, temporary employees shall be covered by the Grievance Procedure solely for purposes of adjudicating grievances relating to Sections identified within this Section. Where the provisions in Personnel Rule 11 do not conflict with the expressed provisions of this Agreement, the Personnel Rule 11 shall apply and be subject to the grievance procedure as provided for in Article 5.

 2.2.1 Temporary employees who are not in benefits-eligible assignments shall be paid for all hours worked at the first Pay Step of the hourly rates of pay set forth within the appropriate Appendix covering the classification of work in which he/she is employed. Temporary employees who are in a benefits-eligible assignment shall receive step increases consistent with Personnel Rule 11.

 2.2.2 Premiums Applicable Only to City of Seattle Temporary Employees who are not in benefits-eligible assignments -- Each temporary employee shall receive premium pay as hereinafter set forth based upon the corresponding number of cumulative non-overtime hours worked by the temporary employee, unless the employee is in a benefits-eligible assignment:

 0001st hour through 0520th hour 5% premium pay

 0521st hour through 1,040th hour 10% premium pay

 1,041st hour through 2,080th hour 15% premium pay (If an employee worked eight hundred [800] hours or more in the previous twelve [12] months, they shall receive twenty percent [20%] premium pay.)

 2,081st hour + 20% premium pay (If an employee worked eight hundred [800] hours or more in the previous twelve [12] months, they shall receive twenty-five percent [25%] premium pay.) The appropriate percentage premium payment shall be applied to all gross earnings.

 2.2.2.1 Once a temporary employee reaches a given premium level, the premium shall not be reduced for that temporary employee as long as the employee continues to work for the City without a voluntary break in service as set forth within Section 2.2.8. Non-overtime hours already worked by an existing temporary employee shall apply in determining the applicable premium rate. In view of the escalating and continuing nature of the premium, the City may require that a temporary employee be available to work for a minimum number of hours or periods of time during the year.

 2.2.2.2 The premium pay in Section 2.2.2 does not include either increased vacation pay due to accrual rate increases or the City's share of any retirement contributions. Any increase in a temporary employee's vacation accrual rate percentage shall be added on to the premium pay percentages for the temporary employee to whom it applies.

 2.2.3 Medical and Dental Coverage to Temporary Employees who are not in benefits-eligible positions -- Once a temporary employee has worked at least one thousand forty (1,040) cumulative non-overtime hours and at least eight hundred (800) non-overtime hours or more in the previous twelve (12) months, he/she may within ninety (90) calendar days thereafter elect to participate in the City's medical and dental insurance programs by agreeing to pay the required monthly premium. To participate the temporary employee must agree to a payroll deduction equal to the amount necessary to pay the monthly health care premiums; or the City, at its discretion, may reduce the premium pay of the employee who chooses this option in an amount equal to the insurance premiums. The temporary employee must continue to work enough hours each month to pay the premiums and maintain eligibility. After meeting the hours worked requirement a temporary employee shall also be allowed to elect this option during any subsequent open period allowed regular employees. An employee who elects to participate in these insurance programs and fails to make the required payments in a timely fashion shall be dropped from City medical and dental coverage and shall not be able to participate again while employed by the City as a temporary employee. If a temporary employee's hours of work are insufficient for his/her pay to cover the insurance premium, the temporary employee may, on no more than one occasion, pay the difference or self-pay the insurance premium for up to three (3) consecutive months.

 2.2.4 Holiday Work For Non-Benefits-Eligible Temporary Employees -- A temporary employee who works on any of the specific calendar days designated by the City as paid holidays shall be paid at the rate of one and one-half (1-1/2) times his/her regular straight-time hourly rate of pay for hours worked during his/her scheduled shift. When a specific holiday falls on a weekend day and most regular employees honor the holiday on the preceding Friday or following Monday adjacent to the holiday, the holiday premium pay of one and one-half (1-1/2) times the employee's regular straight-time rate of pay shall apply to those temporary employees who work on the weekend day specified as the holiday.

 2.2.4.1 Benefits-Eligible Temporary Employee Holiday Pay - A temporary employee shall be compensated at his or her straight-time rate of pay for all officially recognized City holidays that occur subsequent to the employee becoming eligible for fringe benefits, for as long as he or she remains in such eligible assignment.

 1. To qualify for a holiday pay, the employee must be on active pay status the normally scheduled workday before or after the holiday as provided by Article 9.

 2. Officially recognized City holidays that fall on Saturday shall be observed on the preceding Friday. Officially recognized City holidays that fall on Sunday shall be observed on the following Monday. If the City's observance of a holiday falls on a temporary employee's normal day off, he or she shall be eligible for another day off, with pay during the same workweek.

 3. Temporary employees who work less than 80 hours per pay period shall have their holiday pay pro-rated based on the number of straight-time hours compensated during the preceding pay period.

 4. A temporary employee shall receive two personal holidays immediately upon becoming eligible for fringe benefits, provided he or she has not already received personal holidays in another assignment within the same calendar year.

 5. Personal holidays cannot be carried over from calendar year to calendar year, nor can they be cashed out.

 6. A temporary employee must use any personal holidays before his or her current eligibility for fringe benefits terminates. If a

 employee requests and is denied the opportunity to use his or her personal holidays during the eligibility assignment, the employing unit must permit him or her to use and be compensated for the holidays immediately following the last day worked in the assignment, prior to termination of the assignment.

 2.2.5 A temporary employee who is scheduled to work regularly or on and off throughout the year and who has worked two thousand eighty (2,080) cumulative non-overtime hours without a voluntary break in service and who has also worked eight hundred (800) non-overtime

 hours or more in the previous twelve (12) months, may request an unpaid leave of absence not to exceed the amount of vacation time he/she would have earned in the previous year if he/she had not received vacation premium pay in lieu of annual paid vacation. Where such requests are made, the timing and scheduling of such unpaid leaves must be agreeable to the employing department. The leave shall be handled in a manner similar to the scheduling of vacation for permanent employees. This provision shall not be applicable in cases where a temporary employee accrues vacation time rather than premium pay as set forth within Section 2.2.7.

 2.2.6 Premium pay set forth within Section 2.2.2 shall be in lieu of the base level of vacation and all other fringe benefits; such as, sick leave, holiday pay, funeral leave, military leave, jury duty pay, disability leave, and medical and dental insurance, except as

 otherwise provided in Sections 2.2.2.2; 2.2.3; and 2.2.4.

 2.2.7 The City may, at any time after ninety (90) calendar days advance notification to and upon consultation with the affected collective bargaining representatives, provide all fringe benefits covered by the premium pay set forth within Section 2.2.2 to all or some groups (departmental or occupational) of temporary employees to the same extent that they are available to regular employees within the same group, and in such event the premium pay provision in Section 2.2.2 shall no longer be applicable to that particular group of temporary employees. The City, at its discretion, may also after ninety (90) calendar days advance notification to and upon consultation with the affected collective bargaining representatives, provide paid vacation and/or sick leave benefits to all or some groups (departmental or occupational) of temporary employees to the same extent that they are available to regular employees without providing other fringe benefits; and in such event the premium pay in Section 2.2.2 shall be reduced by a percentage amount equivalent to the value of vacation and/or sick leave benefits. The applicable amount for base-level vacation shall be recognized as four point eight one percent (4.81%) which could be higher dependent upon accrual rate increases. The applicable amount for base-level sick leave shall be four point six percent (4.6%). The City shall not use this option to change to and from premiums and benefits on an occasional basis. The City may also continue to provide benefits in lieu of all or part of the premiums in Section 2.2.2 where it has already been doing so; and it may in such cases reduce the premium paid to the affected employees by the applicable percentage.

 2.2.8 The premium pay provisions set forth within Section 2.2.2 shall apply to cumulative non-overtime hours that occur without a voluntary break in service by the temporary employee. A voluntary break in service shall be defined as quit, resignation, service retirement or failure to return from an unpaid leave. If the temporary employee has not worked for at least one year (12 months or 26 pay periods) it shall be presumed that the employee's break in service was voluntary.

 2.2.9 The City may work temporary employees beyond one thousand forty (1,040) regular hours within any twelve (12) month period; provided however, the City shall not use temporary employees to supplant permanent positions. The City shall not assign or schedule temporary employees (or fail to do so) solely to avoid accumulation of regular hours that would increase the premium pay provided for in Section 2.2.2 or solely to avoid considering creation of permanent positions.

 2.2.9.1 In the event that an interim assignment of a temporary employee to a vacant regular position accrues more than one thousand five hundred (1500) hours or accumulates hours in eighteen (18) or more consecutive pay periods, the City shall notify the union that a labor-management meeting shall take place within two (2) weeks for the purpose of discussing the status of filling the vacant position prior to one (1) year.

 2.2.10 A temporary employee who has worked in excess of five hundred twenty (520) regular hours and who is appointed to a permanent position without a voluntary break in service greater than thirty (30) days shall have his/her time worked counted for purposes of salary step placement (where appropriate) and eligibility for medical and dental benefits under Article 12. In addition, a temporary employee who is in a term-limited assignment shall receive service credit for layoff purposes if the employee is immediately hired (within thirty (30) business days without a break in service) into the same job title and position after the term is completed.

 2.2.11 Temporary employees covered by this agreement who have worked for the City for one thousand forty (1,040) hours without a break in service are eligible to apply for all positions advertised internally.

 2.3 The City participates in programs or may establish programs that result in individuals performing work for the City that would otherwise be performed by employees in positions covered by this Bargaining Agreement. Such programs have included and may include: youth training and employment programs; federal Comprehensive Employment and Training Act (CETA) or similar program; "Project Hire"; vocational rehabilitation programs; work study and student intern programs; work fare programs; court-ordered community service;

 volunteer and other programs with similar purposes. Such individuals shall be exempt from all of the provisions of this Agreement.

 If employees hired pursuant to such programs will be assigned to perform work that requires a special occupational license or certification (other than licenses for driving), the City will first notify the Union. The Union may open for negotiation whether these employees shall be exempt from the provisions of this Agreement under this Section 2.3 or not.

 2.4 The City may establish preparatory training programs, including on-the-job training, for the purpose of providing individuals an opportunity to compete and potentially move laterally or upward into new career fields. It is understood that on-the-job training may involve bargaining unit work even though the "trainee" is not covered by this Agreement. It is also understood that said trainees will not be used for the purpose of displacing regular employees. Employees involved in such upward mobility programs shall not have their original bargaining unit status affected by such plan and shall continue to receive the salary of their regularly-assigned position. The City will furnish the Union a copy of such training plan(s) prior to implementation if they affect bargaining unit employees.

 ARTICLE 3 -- LABOR-MANAGEMENT COMMITTEES

 3.1 The City and Union agree to hold labor-management meetings as necessary. These meetings will be called upon request of either party to discuss contract or non-contract issues affecting employees covered by this Agreement. Subjects for discussion at labor- management meetings during the term of this Agreement shall be as agreed by the parties. The Union shall be permitted to designate members and/or stewards in affected department(s) to assist its Union Representatives in such meetings. The purpose of labor-management meetings is to deal with matters of general concern to the Union and management.

 3.1.1 Interdepartment Labor-Management Committees will be a forum for addressing workplace issues that affect more than one City department. Membership will be made up of management from the affected departments, Labor Relations, Local 32 Union

 Representatives, and employees/stewards from the participating departments.

 3.1.2 Intradepartment Labor-Management Committees will be a forum for addressing issues in a single department. Membership will be made up of management, Labor Relations, Local 32 Union

 Representatives, and employees/stewards. This committee will also be the vehicle that charters Employee Involvement Committees.

 3.1.3 Work Unit Labor-Management Committees will be a forum for addressing issues that affect a work unit in one department. Membership will be made up of management, Labor Relations, Local 32 Union Representatives, and employees/stewards.

 Note: 3.1.1, 3.1.2, and 3.1.3 may include Union Representatives from other Unions.

 3.2 Labor-Management Leadership Committee -- The Labor- Management Leadership Committee will be a forum for communication and cooperation between labor and management to support the delivery of high-quality, cost-effective service to the citizens of Seattle while maintaining a high-quality work environment for City employees.

 The management representatives to the Committee will be determined in accordance with the Labor-Management Leadership Committee Charter. The Coalition of City Unions will appoint a minimum of six (6) labor representatives and a maximum equal to the number of management representatives of the Committee. The co-chairs of the Coalition will be members of the Leadership Committee.

 ARTICLE 4 -- UNION MEMBERSHIP AND DUES

 4.1 It shall be a condition of employment that each employee covered by this Agreement who voluntarily is or who voluntarily becomes a member of said Union shall remain a member of same during the term of this Agreement. It shall also be a condition of employment that each employee hired prior to January 1, 1975, currently covered by this Agreement, who is not a member of the Union shall on or before the thirtieth (30th) day following said date either join the appropriate Union or contribute an amount equivalent to the regular monthly dues of the Union to the Union. Any employee hired or permanently assigned into a bargaining unit job title or position covered by this Agreement on or after January 1, 1975, shall on or before the thirtieth (30th) day following the beginning of such employment join the Union or pay an amount equivalent to the regular monthly dues of the Union to the Union. Failure by any such employee to apply for and/or maintain such membership or pay to the Union an amount equivalent to the regular monthly dues of the Union in accordance with this provision shall constitute cause for discharge of such employee; provided however, the requirements to apply for Union membership and/or maintain Union membership shall be satisfied by an offer of the employee to pay the regular initiation fee and the regular dues uniformly required by the Union of its members.

 4.1.1 Employees covered by this Agreement who satisfy the religious exemption criteria of RCW 41.56.122 shall contribute an amount equivalent to regular Union initiation fees and regular Union dues to a nonreligious charity or to another charitable organization mutually agreed upon by the employee affected and the bargaining representative to which such employee would otherwise pay the regular monthly dues.

 4.1.2 A temporary employee shall, after having worked one hundred seventy-four 174 straight-time hours, pay to the Union in lieu of the Union membership requirement of Article 4 a service fee in an amount equal to the Union's regular monthly dues uniformly required of regular City employees for each one hundred seventy-four (174) straight-time hours worked thereafter within the bargaining unit.

 4.2 When an employee fails to fulfill the above obligation, the Union shall provide the employee and the City with thirty (30) days written notification of the Union's intent to initiate discharge action; and during this period the employee may make restitution in the amount that is overdue. If an employee has not fulfilled the Union membership obligation as described in Section 4.1 by the end of the applicable discharge notification period, the Union shall thereafter notify the City Director of Labor Relations in writing, with a copy to the affected department and employee, of such employee's failure to abide by Section 4.1. In this notice the Union shall specifically request discharge of the employee for failure to abide by the terms of the Labor Agreement between the City and the Union.

 4.3 The City shall deduct from the pay check of each employee who has so authorized it, the regular initiation fee and regular monthly dues uniformly required of members of the Union. The amounts deducted shall be transmitted monthly to the Union on behalf of the employees involved. Authorization by the employee shall be on a form approved by the parties hereto and may be revoked by the employee upon request.

 4.3.1 The performance of this function shall be recognized as a service to the Union by the City.

 4.3.2 The Union agrees to indemnify and save harmless the City from any and all liability arising out of this Article.

 ARTICLE 5 -- GRIEVANCE PROCEDURE

 5.1 Any dispute between the City and the Union concerning the interpretation, application, claim of breach or violation of the express terms of this Agreement shall be deemed a grievance. An employee at any time may present a grievance to the City and have

 such grievance adjusted without the intervention of the Union, if the adjustment is not inconsistent with the expressed terms of this Agreement and if the Union has been given reasonable opportunity to be present at any initial meeting called for the resolution of such grievance.

 5.1.1 Reclassification grievances shall be processed per Section 5.12.

 5.2 The City and the Union encourage the use of the City's Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) Program or other ADR processes to resolve non-contractual workplace conflicts/disputes. Participation in the City's ADR Program or in another ADR process is entirely voluntary and confidential.

 5.3 A grievance in the interest of a majority of the employees in the bargaining unit shall be reduced to writing by the Union and may be introduced at Step 3 of the grievance procedure and be processed within the time limits set forth herein.

 5.4 As a means of facilitating settlement of a grievance, either party may include an additional member at its expense on its committee. If, at any step in the grievance procedure, management's answer in writing is unsatisfactory, the Union's reason for nonacceptance must be presented in writing.

 5.5 Failure by an employee or the Union to comply with any time limitation of the procedure in this Article shall constitute withdrawal of the grievance; provided, however, any time limits stipulated in the grievance procedure may be extended for stated periods of time by the appropriate parties by mutual agreement in writing.

 5.6 Arbitration awards or grievance settlements shall not be made retroactive beyond the date of the occurrence or nonoccurrence upon which the grievance is based, that date being twenty (20) business days or less prior to the initial filing of the grievance.

 5.7 A grievance shall be processed in accordance with the following procedures:

 5.7.1 (Step 1) -- The grievance shall be reduced to written form which shall include identification of the Section(s) of the Agreement allegedly violated and the violation. The Union representative or employee shall forward the written grievance to the management supervisor and the Union representative within twenty (20) business days after the alleged contract violation. The management supervisor shall thereafter convene a meeting within ten (10) business days between the Union representative and aggrieved employee, together with the designated supervisor, the section manager and any other members of management whose presence is deemed necessary by the City to a fair consideration of the alleged grievance. The management supervisor shall give a written answer to the Union within ten (10) business days after the grievance meeting.

 5.7.2 (Step 2) -- If the grievance is not resolved as provided in Step 1 above, the Union representative or employee shall then forward the written grievance as presented in Step 1 to the division head with a copy to the City Director of Labor Relations and the Union representative within ten (10) business days after the Step 1 answer.

 With Mediation:

 At the time the aggrieved employee and/or the Union submits the grievance to the division head, the Union representative or the aggrieved employee or the division head may submit a written request for voluntary mediation assistance, with a copy to the Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) Coordinator, the City Director of Labor Relations and the Union representative. If the ADR Coordinator determines that the case is in line with the protocols and procedures of the ADR process, within fifteen (15) business days from receipt of the request for voluntary mediation assistance, the ADR Coordinator or his/her designee will schedule a mediation conference and make the necessary arrangements for the selection of a mediator(s). The mediator(s) will serve as an impartial third party who will encourage and facilitate a resolution to the dispute. The mediation conference(s) will be confidential and will include the parties. The Union representative and a Labor Negotiator from City Labor Relations may attend the mediation conference(s). Other persons may attend with the permission of the mediator(s) and both parties. If the parties agree to settle the matter, the mediator(s) will assist in drafting a settlement agreement, which the parties shall sign. An

 executed copy of the settlement agreement shall be provided to the parties, with either a copy or a signed statement of the disposition of the grievance submitted to the City Director of Labor Relations and the Union. The relevant terms of the settlement agreement shall be provided by the parties to the department's designated officials who need to assist in implementing the agreement. If the grievance is not settled within ten (10) business days of the initial mediation conference date, the City Director of Labor Relations, the appropriate division head and the appropriate Union representative shall be so informed by the ADR Coordinator.

 The parties to a mediation shall have no power through a settlement agreement to add to, subtract from, alter, change, or modify the terms of the collective bargaining agreement or to create a precedent regarding the interpretation of the collective bargaining agreement or to apply the settlement agreement to any circumstance beyond the explicit dispute applicable to said settlement agreement.

 If the grievance is not resolved through mediation, the division head shall convene a meeting within ten (10) business days after receipt of notification that the grievance was not resolved through mediation between the aggrieved employee and Union representative together with the division head, section manager and department labor relations officer. The City Director of Labor Relations or his/her designee may attend said meeting. Within ten (10) business days after the meeting, the division head shall forward a reply to the Union.

 Without Mediation:

 The division head shall convene a meeting within ten (10) business days after receipt of the grievance between the aggrieved employee, Shop Steward and/or Union representative, together with the division head, section manager, and departmental labor relations officer. The City Director of Labor Relations or his/her designee may attend said meeting. Within ten (10) business days after the meeting, the division head shall forward a reply to the Union.

 5.7.3 (Step 3) -- If the grievance is not resolved as provided in Step 2 above, or if the grievance is initially submitted at Step 3 pursuant to Section 5.2, the Union representative or employee shall forward the written grievance defined in the same manner as provided in Step 1, within ten (10) business days after the Step 2 answer to the City Director of Labor Relations with a copy to the appropriate department head.

 Mediation can be requested at Step 3 in the same manner as outlined in Step 2. The grievance must be filed in the time frame specified in Step 3 and responded to in the time frame specified in Step 3 after receipt of notification from the ADR Coordinator that the grievance was not resolved through mediation.

 The Director of Labor Relations or his/her designee shall investigate the alleged grievance and, if deemed appropriate, shall convene a meeting between the appropriate parties. He/she shall thereafter make a confidential recommendation to the affected department head who shall in turn give the Union an answer in writing ten (10) business days after receipt of the grievance or the meeting between the parties.

 5.7.4 (Step 4) -- If the grievance is not settled in Step 3, it may be referred to the American Arbitration Association for arbitration to be conducted under its voluntary labor arbitration regulations. If the initiating party fails to proceed with the process for the selection of an arbitrator and, as a result, an arbitrator is not selected within ninety (90) days of the referral to arbitration, the referral to arbitration shall be deemed withdrawn. Such reference to arbitration shall be made within thirty (20) business days after the City's answer or failure to answer in Step 3 and shall be accompanied by the following information:

 A. Identification of Section(s) of Agreement allegedly violated;

 B. Nature of alleged violation;

 C. Question(s) that the arbitrator is being asked to decide;

 D. Remedy sought.

 5.7.5 Mediation can be requested at Step 4 in the same manner as outlined in Step 2. The grievance must be submitted to binding arbitration within the time frame specified in Step 4 and processed within the time frame specified in Step 4 after receipt of notification from the ADR Coordinator that the grievance was not resolved in mediation.

 5.8 The parties shall abide by the award made in connection with any arbitrable difference. There shall be no suspension of work, slowdown, or curtailment of services while any difference is in the process of adjustment or arbitration.

 5.9 In connection with any arbitration proceeding held pursuant to this Agreement, it is understood that:

 5.9.1 The arbitrator shall have no power to render a decision that will add to, subtract from or alter, change, or modify the terms of this Agreement; and his power shall be limited to interpretation or

 application of the express terms of this Agreement; and all other matters shall be excluded from arbitration.

 5.9.2 The decision of the arbitrator regarding any arbitrable grievance shall be final, conclusive, and binding upon the City, the Union, and the employees involved.

 5.9.3 The cost of the arbitrator shall be borne equally by the City and the Union and each party shall bear the cost of presenting its own case

 5.9.4 The arbitrator's decision shall be made in writing and shall be issued to the parties within thirty (30) calendar days after the case is submitted to the arbitrator.

 5.10 In no event shall this Agreement alter or interfere with disciplinary procedures followed by the City or provided for by City Charter, Ordinance or Law; provided, however, disciplinary action may be processed through the grievance procedure; provided, further, an employee covered by this Agreement must, upon initiating objections relating to disciplinary action, use either the grievance procedure contained herein (with the Union processing the grievance) or pertinent procedures regarding disciplinary appeals under the City Personnel Ordinance including Civil Service procedures. Under no circumstances may an employee use both the grievance procedure and Personnel Ordinance procedures, including Civil Service procedures, relative to the same disciplinary action. In the event both a contract grievance and a Civil Service Commission Appeal have been filed regarding the same disciplinary action, the grievance will be considered withdrawn.

 5.11 The parties have agreed, through a Memorandum of Agreement, to adopt the following procedures attached thereto that were developed by the Citywide Labor-Management Committee on Progressive Discipline:

 A. Either party may request that grievances submitted to arbitration be subjected to a confidential Peer Review by a committee of peers from management or labor, respectively, in which case the time lines of the grievance procedure will be held in abeyance pending the completion of the Peer Review process; and

 B. Either party may make an Offer of Settlement to encourage settlement of a grievance in advance of a scheduled arbitration hearing, with the potential consequence that the party refusing to accept an Offer of Settlement may be required to bear all of the costs of arbitration, excluding attorney and witness fees, contrary to Section 5.9.3.

 The parties may mutually agree to alter, amend, or eliminate these procedures by executing a revised Memorandum of Agreement.

 5.12 A reclassification grievance will be initially submitted by the Union in writing to the Director of Labor Relations, with a copy to the Department. The Union will identify in the grievance letter the name(s) of the grievant(s), their current job classification, and the proposed job classification. The Union will include with the grievance letter a Position Description Questionnaire (PDQ) completed and signed by the grievant(s). At the time of the initial filing, if

 the PDQ is not submitted, the Union will have sixty (60) business days to submit the PDQ to Labor Relations. After initial submittal of the grievance, the procedure will be as follows:

 A. The Director of Labor Relations, or designee, will notify the Union of such receipt and will provide a date (not to exceed five (5) months from the date of receipt of the PDQ signed by the grievant(s when a proposed classification determination report responding to the grievance will be sent to the Union.

 The Director of Labor Relations, or designee, will provide notice to the Union when, due to unforeseen delays, the time for the classification review will exceed the five (5) month period.

 B. The Department Director, upon receipt of the proposed classification determination report from the Director of Labor Relations, or designee, will respond to the grievance in writing.

 C. If the grievance is not resolved, the Union may, within twenty (20) business days of the date the grievance response is received, submit to the Director of Labor Relations a letter designating one of the following processes for final resolution:

 1. The Union may submit the grievance to binding arbitration per Section 5.7.4 (Step 4); or

 2. The Union may request the classification determination be reviewed by the Classification Appeals Board, consisting of two members of the Classification/Compensation Unit and one human resource professional from an unaffected department. The Classification Appeals Board will, whenever possible, within ten (10) business days of receipt of the request, arrange a hearing; and, when possible, convene the hearing within thirty (30) business days. The Board will make a recommendation to the Personnel Director within forty-five (45) business days of the appeal hearing. The Director of Labor Relations, or designee, will respond to the Union after receipt of the Personnel Director's determination. If the Personnel Director affirms the Classification Board recommendation, that decision shall be final and binding and not subject to further appeal. If the Personnel Director does not affirm the Classification Appeals Board recommendation within fifteen (15) business days, the Union may submit the grievance to arbitration per Section 5.7.4 (Step 4).

 ARTICLE 6 -- WORK STOPPAGE

 8.4 An employee who is eligible for vacation benefits shall accrue vacation from the date of entering City service or the date upon which he/she became eligible and may accumulate vacation balance which shall never exceed at any time two (2) times the number of annual vacation hours for which the employee is currently eligible. Accrual and accumulation of vacation time shall cease at the time an employee's vacation balance reaches the maximum balance allowed and shall not resume until the employee's vacation balance is below the maximum allowed.

 8.10 Where an employee has exhausted his/her sick leave balance, the employee may use vacation for further leave for medical reasons subject to verification by the employee's medical care provider. Employees who are called to active military service or who respond to requests for assistance from Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) may, at their option, use accrued vacation in conjunction with leave of absence.

 Where the terms of this Section 8.10 are in conflict with the City of Seattle family and medical leave ordinance cited at SMC 4.26, as it exists or may be hereafter modified, the ordinance shall apply.

 8.11 The department head shall arrange vacation time for employees on such schedules as will least interfere with the functions of the department, but which accommodate the desires of the employee to the greatest degree feasible.

 The Seattle Public Utilities Distribution Section of Water Operations will use a seniority-based vacation scheduling plan as agreed upon by the Union and the Water Operations Director. Such plan will be subject to modification and clarification by mutual agreement. The number of employees allowed off at any one time will be a prerogative of management as it is a staffing function.

 B. An unforeseen occurrence with respect to the employee's household (e.g., fire, flood or ongoing loss of power). "Household" shall be defined as the physical aspects of the employee's residence.

 The "day" may be used in two (2) separate instances but no more than eight (8) hours shall be allowed in any Agreement year.

 10.4 Wellness Incentive Plan -- Employees within the bargaining unit who, during a payroll year, use less than twenty-five (25) hours of sick leave may convert eight (8) hours of unused, accrued sick leave to a personal vacation day to be used in the next calendar year.

 This benefit shall become null and void when or if the parties negotiate a general leave plan.

 A. Eligibility-to-Retire Requirements:

 * 5 - 9 years of service and are age 62 or older

 * 10 - 19 years of service and are age 57 or older

 * 20 - 29 years of service and are age 52 or older

 * 30 years of service and are any age

 For purposes of identifying all potential eligible-to-retire employees, the City shall create a list of members who are in the City's HRIS system as age 45 or older as of the final day of the contract term and provide this list to the union so that the union can administer the vote.

 1. If the eligible-to-retire members of the bargaining unit vote to accept the VEBA, then all members of the bargaining unit who retire during the term of this contract, shall either:

 a. place their sick leave cashout at 35% into their VEBA account, or

 b. forfeit the sick leave cash out altogether. There is no minimum threshold for the sick leave cash out.

 Members are not eligible to deposit their sick leave cashout into their deferred compensation account or receive cash.

 2. If the eligible-to-retire members of the bargaining unit vote to reject the VEBA, all members of the bargaining unit who retire during the term of this contract shall be ineligible to place their sick leave cashout into a VEBA account. Instead, these members shall have two choices:

 a. Members can cash out their sick leave balance at 35% and deposit those dollars into their deferred compensation account. The annual limits for the deferred compensation contributions as set by the IRS would apply; or

 b. Members can cash out their sick leave balance at 25% and receive the dollars as cash on their final paycheck.

 B. Sabbatical Leave and VEBA:

 Members of a bargaining unit that votes to accept the VEBA and who meet the eligible-to-retire criteria are not eligible to cash out their sick leave at 25% as a part of their sabbatical benefit. Members who do not meet the eligible-to-retire criteria may cash out their sick leave at 25% in accordance with the sabbatical benefit.

 13.1.1 Whenever an employee is injured on the job and compelled to seek immediate medical treatment, the employee shall be compensated in full for the remaining part of the day of injury without effect to his/her sick leave or vacation account. Scheduled workdays falling within only the first three (3) calendar days following the day of injury shall be compensable through accrued sick leave. Any earned vacation may be used in a like manner after sick leave is exhausted, provided that, if neither accrued sick leave nor accrued vacation is available, the employee shall be placed on no pay status for these three (3) days. If the period of disability extends beyond fourteen (14) calendar days, then: (1) any accrued sick leave or vacation leave utilized due to absence from his/her regular duties as provided for in this Section shall be reinstated, and the employee shall be paid in accordance with Section 13.1, which provides payment at the eighty percent (80%) rate; or (2) if no sick leave or vacation leave was available to the employee at that time, then the employee shall thereafter be compensated for the three (3) calendar days at the eighty percent (80%) compensation rate described in Section 13.1.

 13.3 Any employee eligible for the benefits provided by this Ordinance whose disability prevents him/her from performing his/her regular duties but, in the judgment of his/her physician, could perform duties of a less strenuous nature shall be employed at his/her normal rate of pay in such other suitable duties as the department head shall direct with the approval of such employee's physician until the Personnel Director requests closure of such employee's claim pursuant to SMC 4.44, as now or hereinafter amended.

 13.4 Sick leave shall not be used for any disability herein described except as allowed in Section 13.1 or as may be otherwise allowed by SMC 4.44.

 ARTICLE 14 -- UNION REPRESENTATIVES

 14.1 Union Visitation -- The Union Representative of the Union party to this Agreement and/or the duly authorized representative may, after notifying the City official in charge, visit the work location of employees covered by this Agreement at any reasonable time during working hours. For purposes of this Section, "City official in charge" shall mean the supervisor in charge of the work area to be visited or, if the work area is located outside of the corporate limits of the City of Seattle, the "City official in charge" shall mean the official in charge of the particular facility (e.g., Skagit Project) or the official designated by the affected department. The Union Representative shall limit his/her activities during such visit to matters relating to this Agreement. Such visits shall not interfere with work functions of the department. City work hours shall not be used by employee and/or the Union Representative for the conduct of Union business or the promotion of Union affairs other than stated above.

Immediately after appointment of its Shop Steward(s), the Union shall furnish the City Personnel Office and the affected department(s) with a list of those employees who have been designated as Shop Stewards, and failure to do so will result in non-recognition by the City of the Shop Stewards. Such list shall also be updated as needed. Stewards shall be employees covered by this Agreement and shall perform their regular duties as such but shall function as the Union's representative on the job to inform the Union of any alleged violations of this Agreement and process grievances relating thereto. The Steward shall be allowed reasonable time, at the discretion of the City, to process contract grievances during regular working hours.

 14.2.1 Shop Stewards shall not be discriminated against for making a complaint or giving evidence with respect to an alleged violation of any provision of this Agreement, but under no circumstances shall Stewards interfere with orders of the employer or change working conditions.

 14.2.2 If a normal shift or work assignment rotation will result in the transfer of a Union Shop Steward to another shift or work location (reporting headquarters), the Union and Shop Steward will be given a notice of at least two weeks (no less than fourteen (14) calendar days). Upon the request of the Union Business Representative, the affected management Director shall meet to discuss the transfer.

 14.2.3 Employee Participation in Collective Bargaining -- The parties to this agreement recognize the value to both the Union and the City of having employees express their perspective(s) as part of the negotiations process. Therefore, effective August 18, 2004, employees who participate in bargaining as part of the Union's bargaining team during the respective employee's work hours shall remain on paid status, without the Union having to reimburse the City for the cost of their time, PROVIDED the following conditions are met:

 1. Bargaining preparation and meetings of the Union's bargaining team other than actual negotiations shall not be applicable to this provision;

 2. No more than an aggregate of one hundred (150) hours of paid time for the negotiation sessions resulting in a labor agreement, including any associated overtime costs, shall be authorized under this provision.

 3. If the aggregate of one hundred fifty (150) hours is exceeded, the Union shall reimburse the City for the cost of said employee(s) time, including any associated overtime costs.

 ARTICLE 15 -- WORK OUTSIDE OF CLASSIFICATION

 15.1 Work Out of Class is a management tool, the purpose of which is to complete or provide essential public services. Whenever an employee is assigned by the proper authority to perform the normal, ongoing duties of and accept responsibility of a higher-paid position when the duties of the higher position are clearly outside the scope of an employee's regular classification for a period of three (3) consecutive hours or longer, he/she shall be paid at the out-of-class salary rate while performing such duties and accepting such responsibility. The out-of-class salary rate shall be determined in the same manner as for a promotion. "Proper authority" shall be a supervisor, manager, or director directly above the position that is being filled out of class, who has budget management authority of the work unit as determined by the department head. Employees must meet the minimum qualifications of the higher class and must have demonstrated or be able to demonstrate their ability to perform the duties of the class. Upon the request by the Union, the City shall provide documentation of a Washington State journey-level plumber's license for those employees who are currently assigned to work out of class in the Plumber job classification. The City may work employees out of class across bargaining unit jurisdictions for a period not to exceed six (6) continuous months. The six- (6) month period may be exceeded under the following circumstances: (1) when a hiring freeze exists and vacancies cannot be filled; (2) extended industrial or off-the-job injury or disability; (3) when a position is scheduled for abrogation; (4) a position is encumbered (an assignment in lieu of a layoff; e.g., as with the renovation of the Seattle Center Coliseum. When such circumstances require that an out-of-class assignment be extended beyond six (6) months, the employer shall notify the Union or Unions that represent the employee who is so assigned and/or the body of work that is being performed on an out- of-class basis. After nine (9) months, the Union that represents the body of work being worked out of class must concur with any additional extension of the assignment. The Union that represents the body of work will consider all requests on a good faith basis.

 15.1.1 An out-of-class assignment shall be formally made in advance of the out-of-class opportunity created in normal operating conditions. Where the work is not authorized in advance, it is the responsibility of the proper authority to determine immediately how to accomplish the duties that would otherwise constitute an out-of- class assignment. Any employee may request that this determination be made. The employee will not carry out any duty of the higher- level position when such duty is not also a duty of his or her own classification if the employee is not formally assigned to perform the duties on an out-of-class basis.

 15.1.2 No employee may assume the duties of the higher-paid position without being formally assigned to do so except in a bona fide emergency. When an employee has assumed an out-of-class role in a bona fide emergency, the individual may apply to his/her department head for retroactive payment of out-of-class pay. The decision of the department head as to whether the duties were performed and whether performance thereof was appropriate shall be final.

 15.1.3 The practice of no out-of-class pay for paid leave will continue.

 15.1.4 When an employee is assigned to perform out-of-class duties in the same title for a total of twelve (12) months (each 2088 hours) of actual service, they will receive one step increment in the higher paid title; provided that they have not received a step increment in the out-of-class title based on changes to the primary pay rate within the previous twelve (12) months, and that such increment does not exceed the top step of the higher salary range.

 15.1.5 Hours worked out-of-class that were properly paid per this Article, shall apply toward salary step placement if the employee is appointed or their position is reclassified to the same title as the out-of-class assignment within twelve (12) months of the end of such assignment.

 15.2 An employee may be temporarily assigned to perform the duties of a lower classification without a reduction in pay. When employees voluntarily apply for and voluntarily accept a position in a lower-level classification, they shall receive the salary rate for the lower class; which, without increase, is nearest to the salary rate to which such employee was entitled in the higher class. For such temporary period, the employee shall continue to pay dues and belong to the Union he always belonged to. The overtime provisions applicable are those of the contract covering the bargaining unit position of the work being performed on an overtime basis. At management's discretion, an employee may be temporarily assigned the duties of a lower-level class or the duties of a class with the same pay rate range as his/her primary class, across Union jurisdictional lines, with no change to his or her regular pay rate. Out-of-class provisions related to threshold for payment, salary step placement, service credit for salary step placement, and payment for absences do not apply in these instances.

 15.2.1 An employee who is temporarily unable to perform the regular duties of his/her classification due to an off-the-job injury or illness may opt to perform work within a lower paying classification dependent upon the availability of such work and subject to the approval of the Employer. The involved employee shall receive the salary rate for the lower class that without increase is nearest to the salary rate to which such employee was entitled in the higher class.

 15.3 Seattle Public Utilities personnel working out of classification as an acting supervisor will not receive overtime pay pursuant to this contract but shall receive the appropriate supervisory hourly rate of pay.

 15.4 Water Pipe Workers who do not meet the minimum qualifications for Senior Water Pipe Worker, when assigned responsibility for a crew and crew vehicle, shall be paid out-of-class pay at the Senior Water Pipe Worker rate.

 15.4.1 No out-of-class compensation shall be paid for operating a crew vehicle as a means of transporting personnel to and from a job location only.

 15.4.2 All out-of-class pay in this Section shall be subject to the provisions of Section 15.1.

 15.4.3 If an employee is assigned by the department head or designee, pursuant to this Article, to perform the duties of a higher classification on a continuous basis in excess of sixty (60) calendar days, they thereafter, while still assigned at the higher level, will be compensated for sick leave, vacation, and holidays at the rate of the assigned higher classification.

 15.4.4

 17.3 Probationary Period/Dismissal -- An employee may be dismissed during his/her probationary period after having been given written notice five (5) working days prior to the effective date of dismissal. However, if the department believes the best interest of the Employer requires the immediate dismissal of the probationary employee, written notice of only one (1) full working day prior to the effective date of the dismissal shall be required. The reasons for the dismissal shall be filed with the Director of Personnel and a copy sent to the Union.

 17.3.1 An employee dismissed during his/her probationary period shall not have the right to appeal the dismissal. When proper advance notice of the dismissal is not given, the employee may enter an appeal for payment of up to five (5) days salary which the employee would have otherwise received had proper notice been given. If such a claim is sustained, the employee shall be entitled to the appropriate payment of salary but shall not be entitled to reinstatement.

 17.4 Trial Service Period -- The trial service period shall provide the department with the opportunity to observe the employee's work and to train and aid the employee in adjustment to the position, and to revert such an employee whose work performance fails to meet required standards.

 17.4.1 An employee who has been appointed from one classification to another classification within the same or different department and who fails to satisfactorily complete the trial service period shall be reverted to a position within the former department (if applicable) in the classification from which he/she was appointed.

 17.4.2 Where no such vacancy exists, such employee shall be given fifteen (15) calendar days' written notice prior to being placed on a Reversion Recall List for his/her former department and former classification and being removed from the payroll.

 17.4.3 An employee's trial service period may be extended up to three (3) additional months by written mutual agreement between the department, the employee and the Union, subject to approval by the Personnel Director prior to expiration of the trial service period.

 17.4.4 Employees who have been reverted during the trial service period shall not have the right to appeal the reversion.

 17.4.5 The names of regular employees who have been reverted for purposes of re-employment in their former department shall be placed upon a Reversion Recall List for the same classification from which they were appointed for a period of one (1) year from the date of reversion.

 17.4.6 If a vacancy is to be filled in a department and a valid Reversion Recall List for the classification for that vacancy contains the name(s) of eligible employees who have been removed from the payroll from that classification and from that department, such employees shall be reinstated in order of their length of service in that classification. The employee who has the most service in that classification shall be the first reinstated.

 17.5 Subsequent Appointments During Probationary Period Or Trial Service Period -- If a probationary employee is subsequently appointed in the same classification from one department to another, the receiving department may, with approval of the Personnel Director, require that a complete twelve- (12) month probationary period be served in that department. If a regular employee or an employee who is still serving a trial service period is subsequently appointed in the same classification from one department to another, the receiving department may, with the approval of the Personnel Director, require that a twelve- (12) month trial service period be served in that department.

 17.5.1 If a probationary employee is subsequently appointed to a different classification in the same or different department, the employee shall serve a complete twelve- (12) month probationary period in the new classification. If a regular employee is subsequently appointed to a different classification in the same or different department, the employee shall serve a complete twelve- (12) month trial service period in the new classification.

 17.5.2 Within the same department, if a regular employee is appointed to a higher classification while serving in a trial service period, the trial service period for the lower classification and the new trial service period for the higher classification shall overlap provided that the higher and lower classifications are in the same or a closely related field. The employee shall complete the term of the original trial service period and be given regular status in the lower classification. Such employee shall also be granted the rights normally accruing to trial service for the remainder of the trial service period in the higher classification.

 17.5.3 Within the same department, if a probationary employee is regularly appointed to a higher classification while serving in a probationary period, the probationary period and the new trial service period for the higher classification shall overlap provided the higher and the lower classifications are in the same or a closely related field.

 ARTICLE 18 -- HOURS OF WORK AND OVERTIME

 18.1 Eight (8) hours within nine (9) consecutive hours shall constitute a work day and five (5) consecutive days shall constitute a work week of forty (40) hours. Work schedules shall normally consist of five consecutive days followed by two consecutive days off, except for relief shift assignments, 4/10 work schedules, and other special schedules.

 18.1.1 Breaks and Meal Periods -- During a normal work shift of up to twelve (12) hours, an employee will be allowed one fifteen (15) minute paid break in each half of the shift. Employees shall be allowed a one half- (1/2) hour unpaid meal period which shall commence no less than two (2) hours nor more than five (5) hours from the beginning of a regular shift.

 Employees who are scheduled to work an overtime shift on a normal day off shall be allowed breaks and a meal period as allowed for a regular shift.

 18.1.2 Where work conditions require continuous staffing throughout a work shift for thirty (30) consecutive days or more, the City may, in lieu of the meal period and rest periods provided in Sections 18.1.1, provide a working meal period and working rest periods during working hours without a loss in pay so that such periods do not interfere with ongoing work requirements.

 18.1.3 When management deems it necessary, work schedules may be established other than the normal Monday through Friday schedule; provided, however, that where work weeks other than the basic departmental work week schedules in force on the effective date of this Agreement are deemed necessary, the change(s) and reason therefore shall be provided to the Union. Two (2) days' advance notice shall be afforded the Union and employees covered by this Agreement when shift changes are required by their supervisor.

 18.1.4 All work performed in excess of eight (8) hours in any work day or forty (40) hours in any work week shall be considered as overtime. Such overtime work shall be paid for at the rate of two (2) times the employee's regular straight time rate of pay or by mutual consent between the employee and his/her supervisor in compensatory time off at the applicable overtime rate.

 A "work week" for purposes of determining whether an employee exceeds forty (40) hours in a work week shall be a seven (7) consecutive day period of time beginning on Wednesday and ending on Tuesday, except when expressly designated to begin and end on different days and times from the normal Wednesday through Tuesday work week.

 Notwithstanding the other Sections of this Article, the City may, following consultation and agreement with the Union involved, implement a four (4) day, forty (40) hour work week within its various departments. In administering the four (4) day, forty (40) hour work week, overtime shall be paid for any hours worked in excess of ten (10) hours per day or forty (40) hours per week subject to the terms and conditions as expressed in this Article.

 18.1.4.1 For employees who work a four (4) day, forty (40) hour work week or other alternative work schedule, the following shall apply:

 If a holiday is observed on a Saturday or on a Friday that is the normal day off, the holiday will be taken on the last normal workday. If a holiday is observed on a Monday that is the normal day off or on a Sunday, the holiday will be taken on the next normal workday. This schedule will be followed unless the employee and his/her supervisor determine that some other day will be taken off for the holiday; provided, however, that in such case the holiday time must be used no later than the end of the following pay period. If the holiday falls on a Tuesday, Wednesday, or Thursday that is the employee's normal scheduled day off, the holiday must be scheduled off no later than the end of the following pay period.

 18.1.5 Crew Chiefs Unit -- Administrative overtime shall be defined as overtime for completion or reading of paperwork, attendance at meetings or discussions concerning administrative matters such as time sheets, performance appraisals, sick leave forms or budget matters as opposed to matters related to a specific water operations project. Administrative overtime shall be paid for at the rate of one and one-half times the straight-time rate of pay.

 18.1.5.1 Crew Chiefs Unit -- Field duties and emergency response overtime shall be defined as hours worked, whether before or after a shift or on a call-out basis, involving field duties related to Seattle Public Utilities or other City department operations projects, meetings required to discuss these projects and/or emergency response field duties. Field duty and emergency response overtime shall be paid for at the rate of double the straight-time rate of pay.

 18.1.6 Emergency Call Back -- Employees who are called back to work after completing their regular shift and who are relieved of duty before commencing their next regular shift shall be paid a minimum of four (4) hours' straight-time pay for all time worked up to two (2) hours. Any time worked in excess of two (2) hours shall be paid for at double the straight-time rate of pay for actual hours worked.

 Example:

 Zero (0) minutes to two (2) hours = 4 hours' straight-time pay. Two and one-half (2 1/2) hours = 5 hours' straight-time pay. Four (4) hours = 8 hours' straight-time pay.

 18.1.7 Employees who are called back to work or remain at work on a shift extension on an overtime basis and meet all of the following conditions will receive a compensatory time benefit as described herein:

 Conditions:

 A. The employee is required to work in excess of eight (8) hours on an overtime basis;

 B. The employee's next regularly scheduled shift begins within eight (8) hours of being released from overtime; and

 C. The employee must have worked a total of sixteen (16) hours within the twenty-four- (24) hour period commencing at the beginning of his/her preceding regular shift.

 Compensatory Time Benefit:

 In the event of an emergency, it may be necessary to work an employee over sixteen (16) hours and in that event for each overtime hour worked in excess of eight (8) overtime hours, under the conditions described above, the employee shall accrue one (1) hour of compensatory time, which must be used at the beginning of or during the employee's next regular shift that commences within eight (8) hours of being released from the overtime work.

 At the employee's option such compensatory time may be supplemented with accrued vacation hours or leave without pay or, if deemed necessary by the Operations Manager of the Seattle Public Utilities, or the designated manager in other City departments, or his/her designee, the employee may be required to return to work.

 Such compensatory time shall be earned in addition to the normal

 overtime rate of pay.

 18.1.8 In extended emergency situations, without prior notice, the Utility will switch to two (2) twelve (12) hour shifts until the emergency is resolved. Seattle Public Utilities and the Union agree to participate in joint labor-management meetings to discuss the terms and conditions of switching to two twelve hour shifts.

 18.1.9 Meal Reimbursement -- Full time employees shall be eligible for a meal reimbursement benefit when directed to work two or more hours of unscheduled overtime, or ten or more hours of overtime on a scheduled basis. For the purposes of meal reimbursement only, scheduled overtime is any period of overtime work where the date, start time and stop time are communicated to the affected employee 12 or more hours in advance of the scheduled start time, and where such a notified employee has had at least 8 hours off work, prior to the start of the scheduled overtime.

 A. Unscheduled Overtime -- After a full time employee has worked two hours of unscheduled overtime, he or she shall be eligible for a meal reimbursement benefit. After this two-hour requirement has been satisfied, he or she shall be eligible for one additional meal reimbursement benefit for each additional five-hour period of unscheduled overtime worked. Such benefits apply without regard to whether or not the overtime is worked adjacent to a scheduled shift.

 B. Scheduled Overtime -- After a full time employee has worked ten hours of overtime, resulting from a scheduled overtime assignment, he or she shall be eligible for a meal reimbursement benefit. After this 10-hour requirement has been satisfied, he or she shall be eligible for one additional meal reimbursement benefit for each additional five-hour period of overtime worked. Such benefits apply without regard to whether or not the overtime is worked adjacent to a scheduled shift.

 C. Extension of Scheduled Overtime -- If a period of scheduled overtime is planned to last for eight hours or less, no meal reimbursement eligibility shall exist for that scheduled overtime period because fewer than ten hours of overtime had been scheduled. However, if an eight-hour or shorter scheduled overtime period must later be extended two or more hours past its scheduled stop time, then any additional overtime hours, by themselves, shall be treated as unscheduled overtime as provided for in A above.

 Reimbursement shall be made for cost, up to a maximum of $12.00, if a dated, itemized, original receipt from the establishment is provided by the employee. The receipt must indicate that the meal was purchased no more than two hours before or two hours after the qualifying period of overtime. The City shall not reimburse the cost of alcoholic beverages and gratuities. An employee may, at his or her discretion, apply for a $10.00 meal allowance in lieu of the meal reimbursement benefit. Submission of receipts will not be required for meal allowance applications. An employee qualifying for a meal reimbursement benefit must submit either an application for meal reimbursement, or an application for meal allowance, no later than the close of the business day following the day the meal was purchased. Absent such an application, no reimbursement or allowance will be paid.

 A department may, at its discretion, provide or engage another agency to provide one or all of the meals for which the meal reimbursement or allowance benefit would otherwise apply. Employees shall not be eligible for meal reimbursement or allowance for meals so provided.

 18.2 Meal Reimbursement while on Travel Status An employee shall be reimbursed for meals while on travel status at the federal per diem rate. An employee will not be required to submit receipts for meals and may retain any unspent portion of an advance cash allowance for meals.

 18.3 Standby Duty (Applicable in all departments and to all bargaining unit employees) -- Whenever an employee is placed on voluntary Standby Duty, that employee shall be available at a predetermined location or by pager Standby, at the employee's option, to respond to emergency calls and, when necessary, return immediately to work. An employee on Standby Duty shall be paid at the rate of ten percent (10%) of the employee's straight-time hourly rate of pay. When an employee is required to return to work while on Standby Duty, the Standby Duty pay shall be discontinued for actual hours worked and compensation shall be provided in accordance with Section 18.1.6.

 18.4 Seattle Public Utilities' Standby Procedure -- Voluntary Standby Rosters will be posted for the Water Operations Division and Watersheds and Transmission Divisions. Senior Workers, Workers and Apprentices in the Operations Division and Senior Workers in the Watersheds and Transmission Divisions may indicate their willingness to be placed on the Standby Roster by advising the Supervisor charged with maintaining the Standby Roster in writing of their willingness for Standby Duty. An employee shall have his/her name removed from the Standby Roster upon written notification to the Supervisor one week (seven calendar days) prior to his/her scheduled date to commence Standby Duty. An employee may have his/her name withdrawn on short notice, less than seven (7) days, if a volunteer is substituted in his/her place within the same classification. Assignment for Standby Duty from the Standby Roster will be rotated on a weekly basis. It is the responsibility of the employee to be aware of his/her position on the Roster and to be prepared for rotation to Standby Duty (see clarification below).

 18.4.1 If the Standby Roster sign-up procedure described in Section 18.3 does not produce sufficient personnel by noon on Monday of a given week to field a Standby crew consisting of one (1) Crew Chief, one (1) Senior Water Pipe Worker, and one (1) Water Pipe Worker/Apprentice in Operations Division, and one (1) Crew Chief or Senior Worker in the Watershed and Transmission Divisions for the ensuing seven (7) day standby period commencing Friday evening, the Seattle Public Utilities will immediately notify the Shop Steward or Business Agent of such fact. If the Union cannot provide sufficient, additional individuals for Standby Duty commencing that Friday evening by noon Friday, the Seattle Public Utilities may designate additional personnel to provide equivalent coverage. Designation may be rotated, starting with the least senior employee within each appropriate class, from a list of all affected employees. (Apprentices are not eligible for at least six (6) months and until determined as qualified.) Seniority is determined by service in the job title; total City service (earned-to-date hours) will break a tie in seniority.

 18.4.2 Personnel on Standby are expected to call within fifteen (15) minutes after being paged. When an employee is required to return to work while on standby duty, the standby pay shall be discontinued for the actual hours on work duty and compensation shall be provided for actual hours worked and in accordance with 18.1.6.

 Crew personnel on pager Standby will be allowed to take a City vehicle home or be paid mileage for the use of their private vehicle, at the City's option. Crew Chiefs, when on Standby, will be allowed to take their City vehicle home. If an employee is assigned a City vehicle to take home, overtime pay will start from the time the employee is contacted.

 18.4.3 If personnel who volunteer and are assigned Standby Duty require additional training, such training, travel, and travel time shall be at Seattle Public Utilities' expense if required on off-duty time. No employee shall be required to report to other than his normal duty station to commence his/her work day for purposes of such training.

 18.4.4 Nothing herein shall be construed to guarantee a minimum staffing level for Standby Duty nor is a maximum level to be implied.

 18.4.5 Seattle Public Utilities and the Union agree to participate in joint labor-management meetings to discuss the terms and conditions of Seattle Public Utilities' standby procedures. Upon mutual agreement, the procedures may be revised and implemented during the life of this agreement.

 18.5 Before instituting a standby procedure applicable to any bargaining unit title in any City department, the department shall notify the Union of the procedure and shall provide the Union no less than fifteen (15) calendar days for comments or for proposing an alternative procedure. Failing agreement on an alternative procedure within thirty (30) days from the date a procedure was originally proposed, the department may implement its originally proposed procedure or a modification thereof. With any procedure, if sufficient volunteers are not available to staff a standby procedure, all employees working at an affected facility, geographical area, or in the work unit may be assigned on a rotating basis, starting with the least senior employee in the affected job title(s). Seniority is determined by service in the job title(s); alphabetical order of last names shall break a tie in seniority.

 A department may continue an existing standby procedure and assignment rotation unless a different arrangement is agreed upon. Before the department institutes a change in the standby procedure, the Union shall be notified and shall be provided no less than fifteen (15) calendar days for comments or to propose an alternative procedure. Failing agreement on an alternative procedure within thirty (30) days from the date procedure modifications were originally proposed, the department may implement its originally proposed modifications or an alternative modification. With any procedure, if sufficient volunteers are not available to staff a standby procedure, all employees working at an affected facility, geographical area, or in the work unit may be assigned on a rotating basis, starting with the least senior employee in the affected job title(s). Seniority is determined by service in the job title(s); alphabetical order of last names shall break a tie in seniority.

 18.6 Employees in the Water Operations and Water Quality units of the Seattle Public Utilities who are scheduled to work not less than four (4) hours of a regular work shift during the evening (swing) or night (graveyard) shift, shall receive one of the following premiums for all scheduled hours worked during such shift.

 Swing Shift $.65 hour Graveyard Shift $.90 hour

 The above shift premium shall apply to time worked as opposed to time-off with pay; and therefore, for example, the premium shall not apply to sick leave, vacation, holiday pay, funeral leave, or other paid leave benefit.

 Overtime shall be computed from the employee's base pay and shall not include the shift premium pay. However, an employee assigned to work one of these shifts on an overtime basis shall be paid the premium pay in addition to the overtime pay if actual overtime work continues for four (4) hours or more.

 In no event shall shift premium pay be due employees who work overtime as an extension of their regular shift or on a call-out basis if not being assigned to work in one of the positions normally scheduled for swing or graveyard shift.

If there is more than one employee eligible for transfer in lieu of layoff in the same job title, the employee names shall be placed on a layoff transfer list in order of job class seniority. Eligibility to choose this opportunity to transfer is limited to those employees who have no rights to other positions in the application of the layoff language herein including Section 19.3.4.

Reorganization when used as a criterion for layoff under this Agreement shall be based upon specific policy decision(s) by legislative authority to eliminate, restrict or reduce functions or funds of a particular department.

 19.3.2 In a given class in a department, the following shall be the order of layoff:

 A. Interim appointees

 B. Temporary or intermittent employees not earning service credit.

 C. Probationary employees*

 D. Trial service employees* (who cannot be reverted in accordance with Section 17.4.2.)

 19.3.3 However, the City may lay off out of the order described above for one or more of the reasons cited below:

 A. Upon showing by the appointing authority that the operating needs of the department require a special experience, training, or skill.

 B.

 D. Regular employees laid off from the same classification in another City department and regular employees on a Layoff Transfer List. The regular employee on this combined list who has the most service credit and who has the job skills necessary for the vacant position will be offered employment on a trial basis in said vacancy. The trial service provisions of Article 17, Section 17.4 shall apply.

 E. Trial service employees laid off from the same classification in another City department and trial service employees on a Layoff Transfer List.

Otherwise, this section shall only be applicable to those positions that are covered by this Agreement.

 19.4.4 Nothing in this Article shall prevent the reinstatement of any regular, trial service, or probationary employee for the purpose of appointment to another lateral title or for voluntary reduction in class as provided in this Article.

 19.5 For purposes of layoff, service credit in a class for a regular employee shall be computed to cover all service subsequent to their regular appointment to a position in that class and shall be applicable in the department in which employed and specifically as follows:

 Attachment 3: Settlement Agreement

 SETTLEMENT AGREEMENT

 THIS SETTLEMENT AGREEMENT ("Agreement") is entered into and between the Journeymen Apprentices of Plumbing Pipe Fitting Industry, Local 32 ("the Union") and the City of Seattle ("City") (collectively "Parties").

 BACKGROUND

 The Union is the exclusive collective bargaining representative for all regular/probationary full-time and part-time employees in the titles of Plumber, Senior Plumber, and Plumber Crew Chief. The intent of this Agreement is to fully resolve all impact bargaining related to the City of Seattle's adopted revisions to the Plumber, Senior Plumber, and Plumber Crew Chief ("Plumber series") job class specifications as reflected in Class Specification Schematic Numbers 8001504, 8001505, and 8001506. In addition, the Parties intend this Agreement to fully resolve the December 21, 2005 and July 16, 2007 reclassification grievances filed by the Union on behalf of its membership in the Plumber series, as well as the August 28, 2007 Arbitration demand filed by the Union on behalf of Senior Plumbers Larry Gable, Cindy Lund, and Cyrus Love.

 AGREEMENT

 In full and final settlement of all impact bargaining and reclassification grievances relating to the Plumber series, and in consideration of the mutual promises set forth below, and of good and valuable consideration, the Parties hereby agree as follows:

 1. Effective December 26, 2007, the City agrees to increase the wage rate of the Plumber, Senior Plumber and Plumber Crew Chief classifications as follows:

 Classification Step 1 Step 2 Step 3 Step 4 Step 5

 Plumber $28.05 $29.16 $30.81

 Plumber, Senior $31.47 $32.73

 Plumber Crew Chief $30.78 $32.01 $33.29 $34.62 $36.00

 The above rates of pay reflect an agreement by the City to increase the wage rates of the Plumber, Senior Plumber, and Plumber Crew Chief classifications by a total of 8.81%. This percentage increase includes the 3.8% cost of living adjustment for 2008 which was tentatively agreed to by the City and the Coalition of City Unions ("Coalition Tentative Agreement"). In addition, the above rates reflect the City's one-time agreement to increase the top step of the Plumber Crew Chief classification to establish a 10% differential from the top step of the Senior Plumber classification, and to increase the top step of the Senior Plumber classification to establish an 8% differential from the top step of the Plumber classification. Each corresponding step within the Senior Plumber and Crew Chief Plumber classification was then set apart by a 4% differential.

 2. For years 2009 and 2010, the City agrees to increase the wage rate of the Plumber, Senior Plumber, and Plumber Crew Chief classifications consistent with the terms of the Coalition Tentative Agreement.

 3. The Union agrees to withdraw the Senior Plumbers' reclassification grievance, and agrees it will not make any further demands which assert that Senior Plumbers Larry Gable, Cindy Lund, and Cyrus Love should be reclassified to the Plumber Crew Chief classification. The Union further agrees that for the time period November 21, 2005, to the present, the Senior Plumbers were fully and adequately compensated out-of-class for any and all Crew Chief duties and supervisory work they performed.

 4. The Union agrees to withdraw the Plumber Crew Chief reclassification grievance, and agrees it will not make any further demands which assert that the Crew Chief position should be reclassified.

 5. The Union further agrees not to dispute or challenge the findings and recommendations in (a) Class Determination Report No. 06-8759, dated July 16, 2007, or (b) Class Determination Report No. 07-9739, dated December 24, 2007.

 6. The Parties agree that the revised Plumber job class specification (#8001504) adopted on or about November 20, 2006, fairly and accurately describes the current characteristics, duties, demands, qualifications, requirements, and all other aspects of the Plumber position. The Parties further agree that they have completed all impact bargaining related to the November 20, 2006 Plumber job class specification revisions.

 7. The Parties agree that the revised Senior Plumber job class specification (#8001505) adopted on or about December 13, 2006, fairly and accurately describes the current characteristics, duties, demands, qualifications, requirements, and all other aspects of the Senior Plumber position. The Parties further agree that they have completed all impact bargaining related to the December 13, 2006 Senior Plumber job class specification revisions.

 8. The Parties agree that the revised Plumber Crew Chief job class specification (#8001506) adopted on or about August 10, 2007, fairly and accurately describes the current characteristics, duties, demands, qualifications, requirements, and all other aspects of the Plumber Crew Chief position. The Parties further agree that they have completed all impact bargaining related to the August 10, 2007 Plumber Crew Chief class specification revisions.

 9. This Agreement contains the full and complete agreement between the Parties relating to items number one (1) through eight (8) in this Section. Any prior discussions, negotiations, commitments and understandings related to this Agreement are hereby merged herein. No representations, oral or otherwise, express or implied, other than those contained in this Agreement have been made by any party. This Agreement is final and binding and cannot be modified without the express written consent of all Parties hereto. This Agreement cannot be amended or changed orally.

 10. If any part of this Agreement is found to be unenforceable, then all remaining provisions of this Agreement shall remain in full force and effect.
