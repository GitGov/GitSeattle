 WHEREAS, in response to the 1991 Pike/Pine Planning Study sponsored and conducted by a coalition of Pike/Pine neighborhood and civic groups, business and property owners, and residents, the Pike/Pine Overlay District was established to preserve and enhance the area's mixed-use character; and

 WHEREAS, in March 1999, the City Council adopted Ordinance 119413 amending the City's Comprehensive Plan to include key goals and policies from the 1998 Pike/Pine Urban Center Village Plan. This Plan reaffirmed the neighborhood's commitment to mixed-use development, while identifying additional priorities including: 1) sustaining the character of Pike/Pine through implementation of urban design recommendations and policy changes and 2) considering a "conservation district" for the neighborhood; and

 WHEREAS, opportunities to implement these goals and policies exist through amending and expanding the existing Pike/Pine Overlay District; NOW, THEREFORE,

 BE IT ORDAINED BY THE CITY OF SEATTLE AS FOLLOWS:

 Section 1. The Official Land Use Map, Chapter 23.32 of the Seattle Municipal Code, is amended to expand the boundaries of the Pike/Pine Overlay District, located on pages 110 and 111 of the Official Land Use Map, to rename the district as the "Pike/Pine Conservation Overlay District," to add the Pedestrian zoning designation (suffix P) to all property within the existing boundaries of the District and one small area bounded by E. Union Street, Broadway Court, E. Seneca Street, and 10th Avenue located within the proposed boundaries of the District, to remove all property within the proposed boundaries of the District from the Capitol Hill Station Area Overlay District and to remove the First Hill Station Area Overlay District, all as shown on Exhibit A attached to this ordinance.

 23.73.002 Purpose and intent~~.~~

 The purpose of this chapter is to implement Resolution 28657, calling for development of the Pike/Pine Overlay District in order to preserve and enhance the balance of residential and commercial uses, by encouraging residential development and discouraging large, single-purpose commercial development. In addition, a purpose of this chapter is to promote the conservation of Pike/Pine's existing historic character by limiting new development to a scale that is compatible with the established development pattern, accommodating arts facilities and small businesses at street level, and encouraging the retention of the existing structures and their architectural features that establish the District's architectural character; generally, those structures that have been in existence for 75 years or more ("character structures") and are related to the area's early history as Seattle's original "auto row".

Section 4. Section 23.73.004 and Exhibit 23.73.004A of the Seattle Municipal Code, which section was last amended by Ordinance 120004, are amended as follows:

 23.73.009 Floor area ratio

 A. The floor area ratio (FAR) limits of the underlying zones for residential use apply to all structures and lots within the boundaries of the Pike/Pine Conservation Overlay District.

 B. The gross floor area of non-residential use is limited to a maximum of 2 FAR, except for the following:

 1. For all structures greater than 30 feet in height, the gross floor area in non-residential use is limited to the lesser of 50 percent of the total gross floor area of all structures on a lot, or 2 FAR.

 2. For development on a lot that meets all of the following conditions, the only limit on the gross floor area in non-residential uses shall be the FAR limit established by the underlying zoning for non- residential uses:

 a. The lot is 18,000 square feet in area or less;

 b. The lot abuts a street that is a boundary of the Pike/Pine Conservation Overlay District; and

 c. The lot is across a street from a lot that is:

 1) zoned NC3 65 or NC3P 65;

 2) located outside the Pike/Pine Conservation Overlay District; and

 3) is not located within a Major Institution Overlay Zone.

 C. In addition to the floor area exempt under the provisions of the underlying zone, the following floor area is exempt from the calculation of gross floor area subject to an FAR limit and from the limit on nonresidential use in 23.73.009.B:

 1. Non-residential use located in a character structure, provided that the non-residential use does not displace an existing residential use.

 2. New non-residential floor area added to a character structure, provided that the added floor area does not exceed the equivalent of 0.5 FAR, as calculated on the lot occupied by the character structure at the time it was built.

 3. Street level commercial uses complying with the standards of 23.47A.008 and 23.73.008.B.

 4. Floor area used for the creation, display, performance or screening of art for members of the general public and floor area used by an arts facility.

 5. All floor area in residential use in a development that meets the provisions of 23.73.010.C, provided that development of the lot does not require the removal of a character structure identified on Table A for 23.73.010.

 6. In areas where the underlying zoning is NC3P/65, all floor area in residential use on a lot that is 8,000 square feet or less in area and has been either vacant or in parking use as of February 27, 1995.

 Section 8. Section 23.73.010, of the Seattle Municipal Code, which section was last amended by Ordinance 122311, is amended as follows:

 23.73.010 Development standards~~.~~

A. Floor size limit.  1. On lots greater than 15,000 square feet in size, the maximum gross floor area of any single story above 35 feet in height is 15,000 square feet. The floor size limit shall not apply to non- residential uses in a structure developed on a lot pursuant to subsection 23.73.009.B.2.

2. On a lot with more than one structure that exceeds 35 feet in height, or more than one portion of the same structure exceeds 35 feet in height, the floor size limit shall apply to each portion above 35 feet in height. A minimum separation of 40 feet is required at all points between separate portions of a structure above 35 feet in height on the same lot, except that separation between a new structure and an existing structure located on the same lot is not required. Where the separation between portions of a structure above 35 feet in height is less than 40 feet, the floor area of each story in the separated portions of the structure shall be combined to determine the floor area subject to the floor size limit.

3. Internal connections above 35 feet in height between new portions of a structure on the same lot and between separate structures on abutting lots are not permitted, unless the structure on the abutting lot is a character structure.  4. For a project that retains the whole of a character structure on the lot, any floor area above 35 feet in height within the character structure, whether connected to a new structure or not, is not included in the calculation of the floor area subject to the limit on floor size.

B. Exceptions to floor size limit. For a structure with a minimum of 50 percent of the total gross floor area in residential use, the Director may permit, as a Type I decision, an increase in the floor size limit to allow additional development flexibility to promote neighborhood conservation objectives and design that minimizes the overall appearance of the project's bulk, provided that no increase in floor size is permitted for a project that will result in the demolition of a character structure. On a lot with an area of 30,000 square feet or less, not counting any area occupied by a character structure, the limit on floor size above 35 feet in height may be increased by 15 percent if one or more of the following conditions apply:  1. Conditions in the vicinity of the lot minimize the impact of additional development bulk on the existing character of the area. Such conditions include locations on the edges of the Pike/Pine Conservation Overlay District where development on large lots already exists, or where irregularities in the street grid have created small blocks or a single lot surrounded on all sides by streets; or

 2. The proposed new project includes features that offset the perceived scale of development, such as a landscaped courtyard that is visible from the sidewalk and located primarily at street level on a street that is not a principal pedestrian street; or

 3. The increase in floor size is for a mixed use project that includes uses contributing to the area's recognized character as an arts district, including performing arts space and artist live/work space, which typically have design requirements, such as non-standard floor to ceiling heights, that reduce the total amount of usable floor area in a structure; or

 4. The additional floor area will facilitate development of housing that is affordable to and occupied by "income-eligible households," as defined in Section 23.58A.004, for a minimum of 50 percent of the total gross floor area of the project and is subject to covenants ensuring that the housing remains available to these households for a minimum of 50 years.

C. Retaining character structures on a lot. A 25 percent increase in the floor size limit above 35 feet in height is permitted for projects that incorporate a character structure on the same lot, either as a whole structure or as a portion of a structure, pursuant to the following provisions.  1. No increase in floor size is permitted under the provisions of this subsection for a project that will result in the demolition of a designated Seattle Landmark or a character structure identified on Table A for 23.73.010.

 2. For a project that incorporates portions of a character structure, the following conditions shall be met:

 a. All street facing facades of the character structure are retained;

 and

 b. All portions of the new structure above the height of the street facing facades of the character structure are set back a minimum of 15 feet from all street property lines that abut the character structure.

 3. As an alternative to the provisions of subsection 23.73.010.C.2, the Director may, as a Type I decision, waive or modify the conditions of this subsection, based on the following:

 a. The portion of the structure that is retained is sufficient to give the appearance of a free-standing building; or

 b. The newly constructed portion of the project, through vertical or horizontal modulation or other design treatments, generally provides for a better integration of the existing structure with the new project, in terms of both physical appearance and the arrangement of interior spaces, than would otherwise occur through the strict application of the standards in subsection 23.73.010.C.1; or

 c. Additional flexibility is necessary to maintain a character structure on a small development lot that is 8,000 square feet in size or less.

 4. Any floor area in a new portion of the structure above 35 feet in height that is within the area of the original footprint of the character structure and is separated from the street along all street frontages by the original facades of the character structure is not included in the calculation of the floor area subject to the floor size limit.

 5. A project that is granted an increase in floor size under the provisions of this subsection 23.73.010.C shall maintain the character structure, or portions of the character structure, both interior and exterior, in good condition and repair and in a manner that preserves unique features and characteristics for the life of the project. Any increase in floor size permitted pursuant to this Section 23.73.010.C shall not be combined with any increase in floor size permitted pursuant to Section 23.73.010.B.
