 If the Grantor transfers the Property, or leases, rents, or otherwise permits any person to use the Childcare Center and Facility Space in any manner whatsoever, Grantor shall remain bound by this Agreement and the Easement and shall not be released from any of Grantor's obligations hereunder.

 16. NONDISCRIMINATION

 Grantor shall comply, and cause all contractors and subcontractors working on the Property to comply, with all applicable equal employment opportunity and nondiscrimination laws of the United States, the State of Washington, and the City of Seattle, including but not limited to Chapters 14.04, 14.06, 14.10, 20.42, and 20.45 of the Seattle Municipal Code (SMC), to the extent applicable, and rules, regulations, orders, and directives of the associated administrative agencies and their officers.

 17. JOINT AND SEVERAL OBLIGATIONS

 The obligations of Grantor hereunder shall be the joint and several obligations of Family Services and LLC.

 18. DEFAULT BY GRANTOR AND REMEDIES

 18.1 If Grantor fails to perform when required any obligation hereunder or in the Easement, or otherwise breaches any term hereof or thereof, the City may provide written notice to Grantor, specifying the nature of the breach and the reasonable number of days (but in any event the City shall not be required to allow more than sixty (60) days) after the date of the notice within which such breach must be cured. Unless Grantor shall fully cure all breaches specified in such notice within the time allowed, Grantor shall be in Default.

 18.2 If any provision hereof or in the Easement specifies that an event or circumstance is a Default, then such event or circumstance shall be a Default without notice, or after the notice specified in that provision, as applicable.

 18.3 In case of Default by Grantor, the City may exercise remedies as specified in Sections 20 or 21 below, or under any applicable provision of the Easement. In addition to or in lieu of the foregoing, the City shall be entitled to all remedies permitted from time to time by the laws of the State of Washington. The City's rights and remedies hereunder are not exclusive, but cumulative, and the City's exercise of any right or remedy due to Grantor's failure to perform any covenant or condition of this Agreement shall not be deemed a waiver of, or alter, affect, or prejudice any other right or remedy that the City may have under this Agreement or by law or in equity.

 19. DEFAULT BY CITY AND REMEDIES

 If, within 30 days after Grantor shall have timely satisfied all conditions to the City's obligation for payment hereunder, the City shall not have tendered to Grantor full payment hereunder, then Grantor may either (1) terminate this Agreement by written notice to the City within 30 days, in which case neither party shall have any liability or obligation hereunder; or (2) pursue any remedy available at law or in equity for enforcement of this Agreement, provided that the City shall not be liable for damages or any other monetary remedy in excess of the total price stated hereunder, plus interest as may be allowed by law.

 20. TERMINATION

 20.1 This Agreement shall survive the execution and delivery of the Easement and shall continue in effect until the earliest to occur of:

 (i) The expiration of the Easement Term; or

 (ii) if the Grantee elects to claim liquidated damages after Default in accordance with Section 21 hereof, the date on which Grantee receives full payment of all liquidated damages; or

 20.2 The City may terminate this Agreement in the event that, prior to payment by the City hereunder, Grantor is in Default.

 21. LIQUIDATED DAMAGES

 21.1 The parties understand and agree that the City's ability to obtain value from the Easement granted is conditioned upon the development and construction of the Property and the completion, opening, and availability for use and occupancy of the Childcare Center and Facility Space. From the nature of this Agreement, it would be impracticable and extremely difficult to fix the actual damages sustained as a result of the failure of the Grantor to complete or make available the Childcare Center and Facility Space, or from its use for purposes contrary to the terms of the Easement. As a result, the parties agree that the City shall have the right to recover, at its option, liquidated damages in the amounts set forth herein, which amounts the parties agree are a reasonable estimate of the damage to the City, and are intended to fairly measure the loss to the City and not to be punitive in nature.

 21.2 In the event that the Grantor fails to complete the Childcare Center, Social Services Facility, or Facility Space or otherwise fails to cause the Use Period to commence by the date required herein, Grantor agrees to pay the City on demand liquidated damages in the amount of the greater of TWO HUNDRED FIFTY THOUSAND AND NO/100 DOLLARS ($250,000) or the amount equal to the total of any purchase money already paid by the City, in either case plus interest. Interest shall accrue from the date of the purchase of the Easement until the date of payment at the rate applied during the same period of time to the participating funds of the Consolidated Cash Portfolio of the City of Seattle.

 21.3 Additionally, in the event of Default after the beginning of the Use Period and prior to the expiration of the Use Period, Grantor agrees to pay the City on demand liquidated damages in the amount of the TWENTY-FIVE THOUSAND AND NO/100 DOLLARS ($25,000) for each year remaining on the Use Period (prorated for any Partial Use Year based upon the number of months remaining) plus interest on that amount, accrued as described in Section 21.2, for each year remaining in the Easement Term.

 21.4 In the event that Grantor sells or transfers the Property, and in the event that such sale or transfer results in a Default, or in the event that liquidated damages are due and owing as of the date of sale or transfer, the parties agree that the liquidated damages will be a lien for the City's benefit upon the property and against any purchase money received by Grantor from the City.

 21.5 After receipt of liquidated damages in cleared funds, the City shall, within a reasonable time, record an instrument terminating the Easement, and this Agreement shall be terminated.

 21.6 The City may, at its option, set off any liquidated damages under this Section against any amount otherwise payable or distributable by the City to Grantor, whether or not in relation to this Agreement or the Property.

 22. COMPLIANCE WITH LAW; INDEMNITY

 22.1 Grantor shall comply at its sole expense with all applicable laws of the United States and the State of Washington; the Charter, Municipal Code, and ordinances of The City of Seattle; and rules, regulations, orders, and directives of their administrative agencies and the officers thereof (all of the foregoing are referred to as "applicable laws"). Grantor shall require all contractors and subcontractors working on the Property to comply with all applicable laws.

 22.2 Grantor represents and warrants that any activities in connection with the development of the Property prior to this Agreement have been in compliance with all applicable laws.

 22.3 Grantor shall defend and indemnify the City and its officers and employees from and against any claim, demand, liability, or loss resulting from the failure of Grantor or of any contractor or subcontractor to comply with applicable laws.

 22.4 This Section 22 shall survive termination of this Agreement.

 23. APPLICABLE LAW; VENUE

 This Agreement shall be construed and interpreted in accordance with the laws of the State of Washington. The venue of any action brought hereunder shall be in the Superior Court for King County.

 24. HEADINGS

 The headings used in this Agreement are for convenience only and do not define or limit the contents.

 25. NOTICES AND REPORTS

Section 570.3, and for ancillary activities in support of such use. At all times during the Use Period, the social services provided by Grantor will include services that provide necessary economic and healthcare support to low-income Seattle residents. Such services may be provided by Grantor, or through agreements between Grantor and other non-profit organizations or public agencies.

In the event the Grantor wishes to relocate the Childcare Center to another area of the Property during the term of this easement, Grantor guarantees that the area will be equivalent to the area shown on Exhibit A-1 and that the operation of the Childcare Center shall remain the same. Additionally, Grantor covenants that it will not make any use of any other area of the Property that will prevent or impair the operation of the Childcare Center.

 3.3 Grantor is solely responsible for maintaining, managing, and operating the Property and the Childcare Center according to its own discretion, subject to the terms of this Easement. The Grantor shall maintain the Childcare Center in good condition and repair, and in compliance with all applicable laws, codes, permits, and regulations.

 4. Easement in Gross for City and Public Use. For the duration of the Use Period, the Grantor grants and warrants to the City the rights to use the Facility Space as described in this Section.

 4.1 The City or a City Designated User shall be entitled to use the Facility Space, or a portion thereof, up to four (4) times per calendar year free of charge for the duration of the Use Period. The following terms and conditions will apply to all uses:

 A. The City or City Designated User shall give the Grantor at least fourteen (14) days advance notice of the date and time when the City or such Outside User requires use of the Facility Space. Such notice shall include the name and contact person of the designated entity to use the space; the hours during which the space is required; what portion of the Facility Space is required, if not all; the nature and purpose of the use; and the anticipated need for parking on the Property for purposes of the use. The Grantor may request modifications to meet its business needs.

 B. The City or City Designated Users, their invitees, and members of the public in the case of uses open to the public, shall have access through such portions of the building as necessary, including elevator, to enter and leave the Facility Space. Sufficient parking on the Property shall be reserved for those attending the designated use.

 C. The duration of each use shall not exceed four (4) hours, which may be wholly or in part in the evening outside normal working hours, in the City's or the City Designated User's discretion. If the use requires that the building be open after normal closing time, the City or the City Designated User, respectively, will be responsible for meeting all reasonable procedures adopted by Grantor for monitoring the building entrance and for securing the building entrance upon completion of the use.

 D. Grantor may establish procedures that guide use, including times of operation, the availability of the Facility Space, codes of conduct, and other policies necessary to efficiently and fairly operate the Facility Space. Grantor may require that the City or City Designated Users of the Facility Space enter a use agreement provided that the use agreement does not impair or unreasonably restrict the Use Rights granted herein, and such agreement is designed to ensure safe and equitable access to the Facility Space, to limit damage to the Facility Space, and to limit Grantor's risk in operating and managing the Facility Space.

 E. The City or City Designated User may place temporary signs, using means acceptable to Grantor, on the Property in order to inform the public of the use and direct the public to the appropriate parts of the Facility Space.

 F. The Grantor shall ensure that the Facility Space is in clean, safe, and usable condition prior to each free use.

 G. Grantor is solely responsible for maintaining, managing, and operating the Facility Space according to its own discretion, subject to the terms of this Easement. The Grantor shall maintain the Facility Space in good condition and repair, and in compliance with all applicable laws, codes, permits, and regulations.

 H. It may occasionally be desirable, given the nature of the use intended by the City or City Designated User, for Grantor to offer, for one or more free uses, the use of other space or spaces within the Property in substitution for the Facility Space. Grantor shall give notice of its desire to offer such substitute space no later than seven (7) days prior to the date designated by the City or other City Designated User for a free use. Any substitution shall require the consent of the City or the mutually-designated Outside User; however, if the substitute space is comparable to or better than the Facility Space, or portion thereof designated by the City or other Outside User, in terms of suitability for the intended purpose, the City or other Outside User shall not unreasonably withhold consent to substitution.

 4.2 The number of free uses will be prorated, rounding up, for all Partial Use Years.

 4.3 For purposes of free uses under this Section 4, any policies or guidelines applicable to City or City Designated User's use of the Facility Space, and any use agreement required by Grantor, shall be subject to the written approval of the City, in its discretion, and if not so approved shall not be a condition to any free use.

 4.4 The City or City Designated Users, respectively, shall be responsible for leaving the Facility Space in substantially its prior condition after each use. The applicable user shall be responsible for any damage to the Property caused by the use, but the City shall not be responsible for any condition or damage caused in the course of use by City Designated Users.

 5. Indemnity.

 Grantor shall have control over and responsibility for the development, operation, and maintenance of the Property, including the Childcare Center, the Facility Space, and the services provided at the Property. As a result, Grantor agrees to defend, indemnify, and hold the City of Seattle, its elected officials, officers, employees, and agents harmless from any and all damages, claims, liabilities, losses, and/or costs of any kind, including attorney's fees, that arise in any way from the development, construction, financing, operation, maintenance, or use of the Property, including without limitation any City use, City Designated User's use, and/or public use under this Easement, including, but not limited to, City use of the Facility Space and surrounding grounds and property. This clause applies to claims, liabilities, costs, losses, and/or damages of any kind notwithstanding any acts, omissions, or negligence of the City or its officers, officials, employees, contractors, or agents; provided, that nothing herein shall be construed as requiring Grantor to indemnify the City against liability for bodily injury or damage to property caused by or resulting from the sole negligence of the City or of any of its officers, elected officials, employees, or agents, and further provided, that if RCW 4.24.115 (or successor provision) shall apply to any claim for any such damage or injury, then to the extent required by such statute, (1) this indemnity shall not apply in case of any liability for damages arising out of bodily injury to persons or damage to property caused or resulting from the sole negligence of the City, its agents or employees, and (2) in case of liability for damages arising out of bodily injury to persons or damage to property caused by or resulting from the concurrent negligence of (a) the City or its agents or employees, and (b) Grantor or its agents or employees, this indemnity shall apply only to the extent of Grantor's negligence. The indemnification obligation set forth in this section shall survive the expiration or earlier termination of this Easement.

 For purposes of this Section, Grantor waives, solely with respect to City, its immunity under RCW Title 51, Industrial Insurance. Grantor and City acknowledge that this waiver has been specifically negotiated and that City would not have entered into the Purchase Agreement absent this waiver.

 THE PARTIES CERTIFY BY THEIR INITIALS BELOW THAT THIS INDEMNIFICATION PROVISION WAS INDIVIDUALLY NEGOTIATED.
