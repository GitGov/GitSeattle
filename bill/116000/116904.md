 Jackie Smith/jfs SCL Nextel Radio Freq Reconfiguration Agreement ORD June 8, 2010 Version #5 FREQUENCY RECONFIGURATION AGREEMENT

 THIS FREQUENCY RECONFIGURATION AGREEMENT (this "Agreement") is made as of this ____ day of _________________, 2010 ("Effective Date"), by and between The City of Seattle ("City"), through its City Light Department ("City Light"); and Nextel West Corp. ("Nextel"), a wholly owned indirect subsidiary of Sprint Nextel Corp., a Kansas corporation (each is referred to in this Agreement as a "Party" and collectively as the "Parties").

 RECITALS

 A. On August 6, 2004, the Federal Communications Commission ("FCC") issued a report and Order that modified its rules governing the 800 MHz band. The purpose of the Order was to reconfigure the 800 MHz band to minimize harmful interference to public safety radio communications systems in the band ("Reconfiguration").

 B. On December 22, 2004, the FCC issued a Supplemental Order and Order on Reconsideration. The August 6, 2004 and December 22, 2004 FCC orders, any binding actions issued by the Transition Administrator pursuant to its delegated authority under the orders ("Actions"), and any supplemental FCC orders in the Reconfiguration proceeding or subsequent Actions after the date of this Agreement, are collectively referred to as the "Order."

 C. Pursuant to the Order, City Light and Nextel are licensed on frequency allocations subject to Reconfiguration.

 D. Pursuant to the Order, Nextel will pay City Light an amount to effect a Reconfiguration of City Light's affected frequency allocations ("Reconfiguration Cost"). City Light will certify to the transition administrator appointed pursuant to the Order (the "Transition Administrator") that the Reconfiguration Cost is the amount necessary to provide comparable facilities.

 FOR GOOD AND VALUABLE CONSIDERATION, THE RECEIPT OF WHICH IS HEREBY ACKNOWLEDGED, THE PARTIES AGREE AS FOLLOWS:

 AGREEMENT

 1.  Frequencies to be Reconfigured : City Light is the licensee under the license(s) granted by the FCC identified in  Schedule A  (the "City Light Licenses") for the operation of certain 800 MHz frequencies at the locations identified on  Schedule A  (the "City Light Frequencies"). Nextel, including its subsidiaries or affiliates, is the licensee under license(s) granted by the FCC (the "Nextel Licenses") for the operation of Specialized Mobile Radio ("SMR") systems on the frequencies and at the locations identified in  Schedule B  (the "Replacement Frequencies"). Pursuant to the Order, City Light must relinquish the City Light Frequencies and relocate its system to the Replacement Frequencies and Nextel must pay the reasonable and necessary cost of relocating the City Light Frequencies.

 2.  Frequency Reconfiguration Process :

 (a) On or before the Closing Date (as defined below) (i) Nextel or City Light will cause the modification of the City Light Licenses to add the Replacement Frequencies or Nextel will cause the creation of a new FCC license for City Light that includes the Replacement Frequencies; (ii) City Light will cause the assignment of the City Light Frequencies to Nextel or will cause the deletion of the City Light Frequencies from the City Light Licenses following Reconfiguration of City Light's system; and (iii) Nextel will cause the modification and/or cancellation of the FCC licenses it holds for the operation of 800 MHz frequencies that are co- channels of the Replacement Frequencies, to the extent required to meet the technical short-spacing requirements of Section 90.621(b) of the FCC's Rules, 47 C.F.R. section 90.621(b) ("Section 90.621(b)"), as such rule may be amended from time to time by the FCC.

 (b) The parties agree that Nextel will make the FCC assignment filings for the Replacement Frequencies on a future date to be determined by the parties through mutual agreement, as provided in Section 4. City Light reserves the right to make its own FCC filings for the Replacement Frequencies on such mutually agreed date, rather than relying on Nextel to do so, by so notifying Nextel in accordance with the Notice provision of this Agreement.

 3.  Reconfiguration Costs :

 (a)  Acknowledgement of Obligations . City Light agrees that:

 (i) the cost estimate set forth in  Schedule C  (the "Cost Estimate") may be amended prior to the Closing Date (as defined below) in accordance with Section 7 (Changes) to reflect addition of costs and equipment associated with the reconfiguration of City Light's infrastructure;

 (ii) after all of the work contemplated by the Cost Estimate has been performed in accordance with this Agreement and accepted and approved by City Light in accordance with the terms and conditions of City Light's approved Implementation Plan (attached to Schedule C), provided that such approval shall not be unreasonably withheld, and Nextel has paid all amounts required by this Agreement, City Light's reconfigured system shall be deemed for all purposes of the Order to be "comparable" to City Light's existing system prior to Reconfiguration, and Nextel shall be deemed to have satisfied its obligations under the Order to pay the cost of relocating City Light's system from the City Light Frequencies to the Replacement Frequencies; and

 (b)  Payment Terms . In order to facilitate City Light's transition to the Replacement Frequencies, Nextel will pay the costs incurred to reconfigure City Light's system in an amount not to exceed the Cost Estimate, except as otherwise allowed by this Agreement. Nextel will make payments in accordance with the payment terms identified on  Schedule C  for both payments made directly to City Light and payments made on behalf of City Light directly to each third party service vendor identified on the Cost Estimate ("Vendor").

 (i) Within thirty (30) days of completion of City Light's reconfiguration and prior to the Reconciliation Date (as defined below), City Light will submit to Nextel documentation demonstrating the actual costs that City Light reasonably incurred or paid to other entities to reconfigure City Light's system ("Actual Costs"). The documentation of Actual Costs ("Documentation") required by Nextel from City Light may include but is not limited to the following: (A) invoices for Actual Costs that are associated with a category of work as identified on  Schedule C ; (B) receipts substantiating the Actual Costs including receipts for any travel expenses incurred by City Light such as hotel invoices, airfare receipts, etc.; (C) City Light's individual employee work orders, time sheets and associated general ledger records specifying the name of the person or employee performing work for City Light, the date work was performed, the hours worked and a description of the activity performed; (D) inventory lists and certified statements of the numbers of tasks completed for reconfiguration; (E) the applicable  Exhibit B  internal labor certifications. Upon receipt by Nextel of the Documentation for all Actual Costs and subject to Section 20(b), Nextel and City Light will reconcile the Actual Costs against the payments made by Nextel to City Light (and Vendors, if applicable) and the Parties will agree upon the amount of any additional payments (subject to Section 7) due to City Light (or Vendors) or any refunds due to Nextel. The effective date of agreement on reconciliation of Actual Costs and receipt by Nextel of the Reconciliation Statement signed by City Light is the "Reconciliation Date".

 (ii) Any additional payments due to City Light from Nextel will be disbursed to City Light within thirty (30) days of the Reconciliation Date, provided the additional payments do not result from Actual Costs that exceed the Cost Estimate (in which case the provisions of Section 3(b)(iii) of this Agreement will apply). Any refunds due from City Light to Nextel will be made within thirty (30) days of the Reconciliation Date.

 (iii) In the event City Light's Actual Costs exceed the Cost Estimate, City Light must submit a Change Notice pursuant to Section 7 of this Agreement describing the change in scope of the work contemplated by the Cost Estimate believed to be necessary that resulted in City Light's Actual Costs exceeding the Cost Estimate. Approval of any Change Notice will not be automatic but will be processed in accordance with Section 7 of this Agreement. Additional payments due to City Light, which result from an excess of Actual Costs over the Cost Estimate, as agreed on the Reconciliation Date, will be disbursed to City Light within thirty (30) days of the Transition Administrator's approval of a Change Notice.

 (iv) Prior to the Closing Date, Nextel will timely pay on behalf of itself and City Light, both Parties' applicable sales and transfer taxes, if any, and all FCC fees in connection with the preparation and filing of the necessary FCC applications for the assignment(s) described in Section 2 of this Agreement.

 4.  Retuning Cooperation : The Parties acknowledge that the number of frequencies and locations covered by this Agreement will require the Parties to cooperate closely in performing their respective reconfiguration activities. The Parties agree that: (i) as of the Effective Date, City Light may begin the reconfiguration of its subscriber units, in accordance with the appropriate sections of Schedule C, (ii) City Light may commence such other activities associated with the reconfiguration of its system as further detailed on Schedule C as of the Effective Date; and (iii) the Parties will agree on a schedule to make the FCC filings, clear the Replacement Frequencies and decommission City Light Frequencies (the "Schedule"). Depending on the timing of the adoption of this Schedule, it may require the submission of a Change Notice in accordance with Section 7 and/or an Amendment to this Agreement, but in any event the Parties agree to adopt the Schedule no later than: (a) sixty (60) days from the Effective Date of this Agreement, or (b) pursuant to a schedule agreed upon at a TA scheduled "Implementation Planning Session" that includes City Light's system, provided the Implementation Planning Session has been scheduled by the TA prior to the expiration of sixty (60) days from the Effective Date of this Agreement, or (c) such other date as the FCC may require. Notwithstanding the aforementioned, in the event the completion date in the Schedule for clearing the Replacement Frequencies and/or decommissioning the City Light Frequencies extends beyond the completion date for such task(s) in City Light's proposed implementation timetable (as submitted by City Light to the FCC in accordance with the Order), the completion date(s) in the Schedule may be subject to FCC approval.

 5.  Representations and Warranties : Each Party represents and warrants to the other as follows:

 (a) it is duly organized, validly existing and in good standing under the laws of the state of its incorporation;

 (b) this Agreement has been duly authorized and approved by all required organizational action of the Party;

 (c) neither the execution and delivery of this Agreement nor the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement will conflict with, or result in any material violation or default under, any term of its articles of incorporation, by-laws or other organizational documents or any agreement, mortgage, indenture, license, permit, lease, encumbrance or other instrument, judgment, decree, order, law or regulation by which it is bound;

 (d) it is the lawful and exclusive FCC licensee of its respective license(s) described in this Agreement, such licenses are valid and in good standing with the FCC, and it has the authority to request the FCC to assign, modify or cancel such licenses;

 (e) there is no pending or threatened action or claim that would have the possible effect of enjoining or preventing the consummation of this Agreement or awarding a third party damages on account of this Agreement; and

 (f) to the best of its knowledge, all information provided to the other Party concerning the transactions contemplated by this Agreement is true and complete.

 All representations and warranties made in this Agreement shall survive the Closing (defined below) for two (2) years.

 6.  Covenants : From the Effective Date until the Closing Date (defined below), each Party will promptly notify the other Party of any pending or threatened action by the FCC or any other governmental entity or third party to suspend, revoke, terminate or challenge any license described in this Agreement or to investigate the construction, operation or loading of any system authorized under such licenses. From the Effective Date until the Closing Date, City Light will not enter into any agreement resulting in, or otherwise cause, the encumbrance of any license for the City Light Frequencies, and Nextel will not enter into any agreement resulting in, or otherwise cause, the encumbrance of any of the Replacement Frequencies.

 7.  Changes  : The Parties acknowledge that as the Reconfiguration of City Light's facilities proceeds in accordance with the work contemplated by the Cost Estimate, the need for changes to the scope of such work may arise. The Parties agree that their review of any such needed changes must be performed expeditiously to keep the work on schedule and that they will provide sufficient staff to manage changes. If either Party believes that a change to the work contemplated by the Cost Estimate is required (including changes by Vendors), such Party will promptly notify the other Party in writing. Such written notice (the "Change Notice") shall set forth (i) a description of the scope of the change to the work contemplated by the Cost Estimate believed to be necessary and (ii) an estimate of any increase or decrease in the Cost Estimate and in the time required to reconfigure City Light's existing facilities to operate on the Replacement Frequencies. A Party receiving a Change Notice shall immediately perform its own analysis of the need for and scope of the change and its impact on the Cost Estimate and schedule and negotiate the change in good faith with the other Party. After the Parties have agreed upon a change to this Agreement, they shall prepare a proposed amendment to this Agreement pursuant to Section 23 and submit to the Transition Administrator a copy of the proposed amendment together with a written request for its approval. Such request shall be accompanied by reasonable documentation supporting the need for and scope of the change and any proposed increase or decrease in the Cost Estimate and in the time required to reconfigure City Light's existing facilities to operate on the Replacement Frequencies. City Light is responsible for all unauthorized changes necessary as it relates to work performed by a Vendor on behalf of City Light. No change to the Cost Estimate, the work contemplated by the Cost Estimate or the time required to reconfigure City Light's existing facilities to operate on the Replacement Frequencies shall become effective until the Transition Administrator has approved the change in writing and both Parties have signed an amendment incorporating such approved change into this Agreement pursuant to Section 23.

 8.  Closing : The closing ("Closing") of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement will take place after (i) FCC approval of the assignment of the City Light Frequencies to Nextel and/or deletion of the City Light Frequencies from the City Light Licenses, (ii) FCC approval of the modification to add the Replacement Frequencies to the City Light Licenses or the creation of a new license for City Light that includes the Replacement Frequencies, (iii) the earlier of notification by City Light to Nextel that the City Light Licenses are clear of all users and thirty-five (35) days following the date Nextel notifies City Light that the Replacement Frequencies have been decommissioned, (iv) delivery by City Light of all receipts, invoices and other documentation required to substantiate the Actual Cost and signing by City Light and delivery to Nextel of the Reconciliation Statement and other documents required to complete the Reconciliation similar to those identified on  Exhibit B , (v) FCC approval of the modification and/or cancellation of the FCC licenses Nextel holds for the operation of 800 MHz frequencies that are co-channels of the Replacement Frequencies, to the extent required to meet the technical short-spacing requirements of Section 90.621(b) of the FCC's Rules, 47 C.F.R. section 90.621(b), as such rule may be amended from time to time by the FCC, (vi) the refund to Nextel or payment to City Light as described in Section 3(b)(ii), (if applicable) and (vii) the satisfaction of all other conditions specified in this Agreement (the "Closing Date").

 9.  Closing Conditions : Performance of each Party's Closing obligations is subject to satisfaction of the following conditions (except to the extent expressly waived in writing by the other Party):

 (a) the continued truth and accuracy of the other Party's representations and warranties set forth in this Agreement;

 (b) all of the covenants of the other Party described in this Agreement are performed in all material respects; and

 (c) execution and delivery by the other Party of Closing documents as well as any other Closing instruments and documents either Party or its counsel may reasonably request. City Light will execute and deliver to Nextel a closing certification required by the Transition Administrator ("Completion Certification").

 (d) The Parties will cooperate in good faith and exercise their reasonable best efforts to finalize and execute these instruments and documents on or prior to the Closing Date in order to effect the Reconfiguration contemplated.

 10.  Review Rights : In order to enable the Transition Administrator to comply with its audit obligations under the Order, City Light agrees to maintain records and other supporting evidence related to the costs that City Light has expended in connection with the Reconfiguration contemplated by this Agreement and that Nextel has paid or will pay to City Light pursuant to this Agreement. City Light agrees to maintain such records and make them reasonably available to the Transition Administrator for review or reproduction until eighteen (18) months after the date of City Light's executed Completion Certification required by this Agreement or for a longer period if City Light, for its own purposes, retains such records for a longer period of time. As used in this provision, "records" includes books, documents, accounting procedures and practices and other data regardless of type and regardless of whether such items are in written form, in the form of computer data or in any other form.

 11.  Excluded Assets; No Assumption of Liabilities : Nothing in this Agreement should be construed as a transfer or assignment from either Party to the other Party of any assets (including FCC licenses) except as expressly set forth in this Agreement. Other than as expressly provided in this Agreement, neither Party is obligated to assign and transfer to the other any asset, tangible or intangible, nor is either Party entitled to assume any asset, tangible or intangible. Neither Party is assuming, nor is either Party responsible for, any liabilities or obligations of the other Party arising out of or in connection with the other Party's licenses (or related systems and facilities) that are the subject of this Agreement.

 12.  Confidentiality : The terms of this Agreement and any proprietary, non-public information regarding the City Light Frequencies, Replacement Frequencies, Nextel's business and City Light's business must be kept confidential by the Parties and their employees, shareholders, agents, attorneys and accountants (collectively, "Agents"), which confidentiality will survive final payment or termination of this Agreement for a period of two (2) years or as long as required by law. The Parties may make disclosures as required by law (Specifically as required by the Washington State Public Records Act, Chapter 42.56 of the Revised Code of Washington) and to the Transition Administrator and to a Vendor.

 13.  Cooperation : The Parties will cooperate with each other and the Transition Administrator with respect to the Reconfiguration work contemplated by this Agreement. Without limiting the foregoing obligations, the Parties agree to cooperate in the preparation of any applications required to be filed with the FCC, and City Light agrees to provide reasonable access to its facilities so that the Transition Administrator may comply with any audit obligations and so any Reconfiguration work contemplated by this Agreement may be performed in accordance with the Cost Estimate and performance schedule. If a Party is subject to a denial of FCC benefits for delinquent non-tax debts owed to the FCC that would prevent or delay the timely processing of any FCC applications, such Party shall cure such delinquency in an expeditious manner and at its sole expense, provided that City Light shall not have to pay any costs or debts owed to the FCC that would be inconsistent with the intent of this Agreement that Nextel shall pay for the cost of relocating City Light's system from the City Light Frequencies to the Replacement Frequencies .

 14.  Indemnification : From and after the Closing Date, each Party (the "Indemnifying Party") will indemnify and defend the other Party, its officers, directors, employees and agents (collectively, the "Indemnified Party"), from and against all third party demands, claims, actions, losses, damages, liabilities, costs and expenses, including, without limitation, reasonable attorneys' fees and expenses (collectively, "Costs"), asserted against, imposed upon or incurred by the Indemnified Party arising from or related to: (i) any breach of any covenant, agreement, representation or warranty of the Indemnifying Party contained in, or made pursuant to, this Agreement; or (ii) any and all liabilities (including successor liabilities) or obligations relating to periods prior to the Closing Date resulting from the Indemnifying Party's operation of the system operated pursuant to the City Light Licenses or the Nextel Licenses, as applicable, or the ownership or use of those licenses or from the Indemnifying Party's employment, or termination of employment, of its employees. The obligations under this Section survive the Closing for a period of three (3) years.

 15.  Disputes : The Parties agree that any dispute related to the Replacement Frequencies, Nextel's obligation to pay any cost of the Reconfiguration of City Light's system contemplated by this Agreement, or the comparability of City Light's reconfigured system to City Light's existing system prior to Reconfiguration, which is not resolved by mutual agreement, shall be resolved in accordance with the dispute resolution provisions of the Order, as it may be amended from time to time.

 16.  No Gratuities : No gift, gratuity, credit, thing of value or compensation of any kind shall be offered or provided by City Light, directly or indirectly, to any officer, employee or official of Nextel for the purpose of improperly obtaining or rewarding favorable treatment under this Agreement.

 17.  Liens : If any liens or security interests attach to any of City Light's facilities in favor of any vendor or service provider that is performing any Reconfiguration work contemplated by this Agreement as a result of Nextel's breach of any obligation to make direct payment (not in dispute) to such vendor or services provider, Nextel upon receipt of Notice from City Light will cooperate to remove any Liens.

 18.  Vendor Performance Issues  : City Light will select and contract directly with any vendor or service provider performing work required to reconfigure City Light's existing facilities to operate on the Replacement Frequencies. Neither the Transition Administrator nor Nextel will be responsible for, or assume the risk of any failure of that Vendor to perform its obligations under any contract entered into between City Light and such Vendor in connection with the Reconfiguration contemplated by this Agreement.

 19.  Termination : This Agreement may be terminated and the transactions contemplated by this Agreement abandoned: (i) by mutual consent of the Parties provided in writing; (ii) for cause by either Party upon material breach of the other Party, following a thirty (30) day period for cure by the breaching Party following written notice of the breach or (iii) by Nextel in the event of any Adverse Decision by any governmental entity of competent jurisdiction affecting the Order. For purposes of this Agreement, an "Adverse Decision" means an order, decree, opinion, report or any other form of decision by a governmental entity of competent jurisdiction that results, in whole or part, in a stay, remand, or reversal of the Order, or otherwise in any revision to the Order that Nextel determines, in its sole reasonable discretion, to be adverse to its interests. In the event of termination, the Parties shall take all necessary action (including preparing and filing FCC documents) to return the status quo ante on the date this Agreement was first executed. In the event of termination, Nextel shall pay all costs associated with the return to the status quo ante except if such termination was due to an uncured material breach by City Light.

</table> SCHEDULE C

 800 MHZ RECONFIGURATION

 COST ESTIMATE - CERTIFIED REQUEST

 Request for Reconfiguration Funding

 Seattle  City  Light

 Pursuant to the Order, City Light is required to reconfigure its existing facilities and requests Nextel to fund the estimated reconfiguration costs included below:

 City Light Payment Terms: Nextel will pay City Light an amount not to exceed the Estimated Cost(s) for City Light with respect to each category of work, as set forth below. Nextel will pay City Light  $78,572.53  within 15 days (30 days if City Light elects to be paid by check rather than electronic funds transfer) after receipt by Nextel of the fully executed Agreement and fully completed City Light Information Form (as set forth on  Exhibit A  ). Nextel will pay any outstanding balance of the Actual Costs due to City Light within 30 days after the Reconciliation Date (as "Actual Costs" and "Reconciliation Date" are defined in Section 3(b)(i)).

 Vendor Payment Terms: Nextel will pay each Vendor an amount not to exceed the Estimated Cost(s) for that Vendor with respect to each category of work, as set forth below. Nextel will pay each Vendor within 30 days after receipt by Nextel of (A) an invoice from the Vendor and (B) City Light's approval of receipt of goods and services and approval of associated costs included on the Vendor invoice.

 1. System Description: Seattle City Light, a municipal utility, and licensee operates multiple 800MHz systems with conventional operation including a five-site 4-channel simulcast system in the Seattle area and a five-site two- channel simulcast system at the Skagit generation facility, and three stand alone sites with four channels each. The subscriber units are a mix of Motorola MAXTRAC, MCS2000, MTS200, SPECTRA, and ASTRO SPECTRA model radios. The site List is as follows: FrenchCreekRoadSnohomishCounty. Gold Mountain, Kitsap County North Mountain Substation, Snohomish County. Rattlesnake Mountain, King County. Queen Anne Hill (1417 Warren North), King County 3929 184th. Cougar Mountain $5A1l73rdStreet SE), King County. Crista (19303 Fremont Avenue North), King County Bothell Substation, Snohomish County. Diablo Powerhouse, Whatcom County. Newhalem Communications Building, Whatcom County. Gorge Dam, WhatcomCounty. Newhalem (3 km SW), Whatcom County. Ross Dam/Powerhouse

 The major system elements to be reconfigured are summarized in the table below:

</table> 2. Reconfiguration Milestones: Identify the anticipated start date of the overall reconfiguration of your system (Project Start). Then, for each major reconfiguration milestone listed in the table below, provide (1) the anticipated number of days after project start date required to begin execution of the task identified, and (2) the estimated duration in number of days required to complete the task identified. As an FRA is negotiated, it is not always possible to know an actual start date for specific reconfiguration tasks. In such a case, it is acceptable to forecast an estimated start date from execution of the FRA (i.e., "contract execution + xx days") and estimate the duration of each task. <table><tr><td>Reconfiguration Task
