 AN ORDINANCE relating to use of sick leave while on disability and eligibility conditions for continued benefits, amending Seattle Municipal Code Section 4.44.020, adding a new Section 4.44.080 and repealing Seattle Municipal Code Section 4.24.020, as contradicting the intent and application of the City's workers compensation supplemental benefit.

 WHEREAS City employees are eligible for a disability supplement, for the first 261 days of disability, that exceeds that provided by the State Industrial Insurance and Medical Aid Act; and

 WHEREAS the disability supplement is intended to make the injured or incapacitated employee financially "whole" without additional benefit;

 Now Therefore

 BE IT ORDAINED BY THE CITY OF SEATTLE AS FOLLOWS:

 Section 1. Seattle Municipal Code Section 4.44.020, Subsection B, Ordinance 90881 as amended, is further amended as follows:

 B. Whenever an employee is injured on the job and compelled to seek immediate medical treatment, the employee shall be compensated in full for the remaining part of the day of injury without effect to his or her sick leave or vacation account. Scheduled workdays falling within only the first three (3) calendar days following the day of injury shall be compensable through accrued sick leave. Any vacation may be used in a like manner after sick leave is exhausted, provided that, if neither accrued sick leave nor accrued vacation is available, the employee shall be placed on no pay status for these three (3) days;  provided, further, that this shall constitute the only authorized use of sick leave or vacation by an employee whose disability claim is subsequently approved. If the period of disability equals or extends beyond fourteen (14) calendar days, then (1) any accrued sick leave or vacation leave utilized that results in absence from his or her regular duties (up to a maximum of eighty percent [80%] of the employee's normal hourly rate of pay per day) shall be reinstated by ~~Industrial Insurance~~Workers Compensation; or (2) if no sick leave or vacation leave was available to the employee at that time, then the employee shall thereafter be compensated for the three (3) calendar days at the eighty percent (80%) compensation rate described in subsection A of this section. The days reimbursed or thereafter compensated shall then count toward the two hundred sixty- one (261) day maximum.

 Section 2. There is added to Seattle Municipal Code Chapter 4.44, Disability Compensation (Ordinance 90881 as amended) a new Section 4.44.080, Eligibility for continued benefits, as follows:

 To remain eligible for the City's supplemental benefits, an employee must be eligible for benefits under Title 51 Revised Code of Washington and must comply with all Department of Labor and Industries rules and regulations and related City of Seattle and employing unit policies and procedures, including

 A. Be responsive to attempts to schedule, and attend:

 1. all medical appointments, treatments, and meetings related to vocational rehabilitation; and

 2. any work hardening, conditioning, or other treatment arranged by the City and authorized by the attending physician.

 B. Accept modified or alternative duty assigned by his or her supervisor when released to perform it by the attending physician.

 C. Attend all meetings scheduled by the City of Seattle Workers' Compensation Unit or the employing unit concerning the employee's status or claim; provided, that the City or the employing unit provides at least five (5) working days' advance notice of such meeting and provided, further, that the meeting date and time do not conflict with scheduled medical treatment. The employee shall provide at least twenty-four (24) hours' notice of his or her inability to attend a scheduled meeting with the Workers' Compensation Unit or the employing unit because the meeting time conflicts with medical treatment.

 D. Workers' Compensation supplemental benefits will be terminated for an employee who fails to attend two (2) meetings or medical appointments as described in this section. The Workers' Compensation Unit will provide a minimum of seven (7) days' notification to the employee prior to terminating benefits.

 Section 3. Seattle Municipal Code Section 4.24.020, Ordinance 88522, is hereby repealed.

 Section 4. This ordinance shall take effect and be in force thirty (30) days from and after its approval by the Mayor, but if not approved and returned by the Mayor within ten (10) days after presentation, it shall take effect as provided by Municipal Code Section 1.04.020.
