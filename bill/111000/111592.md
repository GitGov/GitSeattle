 Section 3. Section 23.44.025 of the Seattle Municipal Code (SMC) is hereby amended and renumbered to Section 23.44.041 to read as follows:

 23.44.0~~25~~41 Accessory dwelling units.

 Accessory dwelling units may be permitted subject to the standards in subsection A ~~below~~ until two thousand five hundred (2,500) applications for new (not for legalization of existing) accessory dwelling units are filed. If, prior to the occurrence of the foregoing condition, applications are filed for accessory dwelling units which would cause the concentration of single-family structures with new accessory dwelling units to exceed twenty percent (20%) of all single-family structures in single- family zones in any one census tract or in an area formed by a circle with a radius of one thousand feet (1,000') from the point at which three (3) or more census tracts meet, no further applications may be accepted for accessory dwelling units in such census tract or area. The Master Use Permit process set forth in Chapter 23.76 shall be followed to authorize these uses.

 A. The Director may authorize an accessory dwelling unit if the Director finds that the unit meets the following development and use standards:

 1. A single-family dwelling may have no more than one (1) accessory dwelling unit, and only one (1) accessory dwelling unit shall be allowed per lot.

 2. One (1) of the dwelling units in the structure shall be occupied by one or more owners of the property as the owner's(s') permanent and principal residence; provided that the Director may waive this requirement for temporary absences of less than one (1) year, where the accessory unit has been a permitted use for at least two (2) years and the owner submits proof of absence from the Puget Sound region.

 3. Any number of related persons may occupy each unit in a

 single-family residence with an accessory dwelling unit provided that if unrelated persons occupy either unit, the total number of persons occupying both units together may not exceed eight (8).

 4. Accessory dwelling units may not be located in any structure detached from the single-family dwelling.

 5. The floor area of ~~at least one (1) of~~ the accessory dwelling unit~~s~~ shall not exceed one thousand (1,000) square feet if a permit was filed to construct the portion of the structure in which the accessory dwelling unit is located on or after May 31, 1996. ~~The Director may waive the one thousand (1,000) square feet limitation where exceeded in an accessory dwelling unit existing on January 1, 1993, if an application to legalize the accessory dwelling unit is filed within eighteen (18) months of the effective date of the ordinance codified in this section and if the Director finds that reduction of the floor area would be impractical.~~

 6. Only one (1) entrance may be located on each front or street side of the residence except where two (2) entrances on the front or street side existed on January 1, 1993.

 7. A minimum of two (2) off-street parking spaces shall be provided, which spaces may be in tandem. The Director may waive the requirement for one (1) or both of the spaces if the accessory dwelling unit is not located in a residential parking zone (RPZ) or in the University District Parking Overlay Area or Alki Area, pursuant to Maps A and B, Section 23.54.015, and if topography or location of existing principal or accessory structures makes provision of one (1) or both of the parking spaces unduly burdensome. The applicant need not apply for a variance in order for the Director to waive this requirement. If the accessory dwelling unit is located in a RPZ and if topography or location of existing structures makes provision of one or both of the parking spaces unduly burdensome, the Director may waive the parking requirement if a parking study is completed  and if adequate parking capacity exists. The parking waiver process cannot be used to eliminate existing parking spaces in order to create an accessory dwelling unit.

 8. If the portion of the single-family dwelling in which the accessory dwelling unit is located was in existence prior to October 17, 1979, the minimum ceiling height shall be six feet eight inches (6'8") measured per Sections 310.6.1 and 3403~~1207~~of the Seattle Building Code.  The minimum ceiling height shall be six feet six inches (6' 6") if a hard- wired smoke detector is located in the dwelling unit. If the portion of the single-family dwelling in which the accessory dwelling unit is located was constructed on or subsequent to October 17, 1979, the minimum ceiling height shall be seven feet six inches (7'6") measured per Sections 310.6.1 and 3403~~1207~~ of the Seattle Building Code.

 B. Legalization of Existing Accessory Dwelling Units. Accessory dwelling units which existed on January 1, 1993, and are not otherwise qualified as a legal nonconforming use, may be legally established if the following requirements are satisfied:

 1. An application for a Master Use Permit meeting the requirements of SMC Chapter 23.76 is filed on or before May 31, 1996~~within eighteen (18) months of the effective date of the ordinance codified in this section~~;

 2. The accessory dwelling unit shall be determined to meet the Housing

 and Building Maintenance Code (Chapters 22.200 through 22.208) standards. In addition, if the portion of the single-family dwelling in which the accessory dwelling unit is located was in existence prior to October 17, 1979, the minimum ceiling height shall be six feet eight inches (6'8") measured per Sections 310.6.1 and 3403~~1207~~ of the Seattle Building Code. The minimum ceiling height shall be six feet six inches (6' 6") if a hard-wired smoke detector is located in the dwelling unit. If the portion of the single-family dwelling in which the accessory dwelling unit is located was constructed on or subsequent to October 17, 1979, the minimum ceiling height shall be seven feet six inches (7'6") measured per Sections 310.6.1 and 3403~~1207~~ of the Seattle Building Code.

 3. Development and use standards in subsection A, above, are met or applications for permits for modifications required for compliance are filed. If final inspection approval for those modifications is not obtained within two (2) years from the date of application for the Master Use Permit, the Master Use Permit and Building Permit shall be canceled and the unit removed or application made to establish the unit as a new accessory dwelling unit. The Director may require final approval of permits in less

 than two (2) years in high hazard situations.

 C. Certification of Owner Occupancy. ~~Prior to the~~After issuance of a permit establishing an accessory dwelling unit, the Department of Construction and Land Use shall record as a deed restriction in the King County Office of Records and Elections a certification by the owner(s) under oath in a form prescribed by the Director that one (1) of the dwelling units is occupied by the owner(s) of the property as the owner's(s') principal and permanent residence~~, but only when the other unit is being rented by the owner(s) of the property~~. When ownership of a single-family residence with an approved accessory dwelling unit changes, the new owner(s) shall either submit a new owner occupancy certification to the Department of Construction and Land Use for recording or remove the accessory dwelling unit~~if the new owner(s) intend to continue renting the accessory dwelling unit use~~. Failure to submit a new certificate or remove the accessory dwelling unit within thirty (30) days of transfer of ownership shall be a violation of the Land Use Code subject to civil penalties provided in Section 23.90.018. Falsely certifying owner occupancy or failing to comply with the terms of the owner occupancy certification~~is~~shall be subject to a civil penalty of five thousand dollars ($5,000), in addition to any criminal penalties.

 D. Notice of Issuance of Permit for an Accessory Housing Unit. The Director shall provide notice of the issuance of a permit for an accessory housing unit by general mailed release~~to record owners of real property within two hundred feet (200') of the site~~. The notice shall state that the unit complies with the standards and conditions of this chapter, shall describe the requirements for maintaining the unit, and shall explain how to obtain general information and how to file a complaint.

 E. Single-Family Status Unaffected. A single-family dwelling with an accessory dwelling unit shall be considered a single-family residence for purposes of rezone criteria (Section 23.34.011~~2~~~~and for purposes of rental housing registration (Section 22.202.060)~~.

 F. At least three (3) months prior to reaching the two thousand five hundred (2,500) limit on applications for new accessory dwelling units  or on September 1, 1999, whichever is earlier, the Department of Construction and Land Use and the Office of Management and Planning ~~Department~~ shall submit to the City Council a report regarding accessory dwelling units established, and, if deemed necessary, recommendations for revisions to the regulations and procedures related to accessory dwelling units. Such report shall include an analysis of the number, location and characteristics of accessory dwelling units (e.g., size, number of parking ~~spaces~~waivers granted, ~~whether the structure was expanded to add the accessory unit,~~ the number of previously unauthorized units legalized, etc.) and an analysis of the impacts of those units.

 Within six (6) months of receiving the report, the City Council shall review the report and consider the recommendations proposed. If the City has reached or is nearing ~~the~~ two thousand five hundred (2,500) ~~limit on~~ applications, the City Council shall determine whether to authorize further permits or otherwise revise the provisions. Any revisions that would involve amendments to the City's Comprehensive Plan shall be considered as part of the annual process for amending the Plan.

 If applications are filed for permits for accessory dwelling units which would cause the concentration of new structures with accessory dwelling units to exceed twenty percent (20%) of the number of single-family residences in single-family zones in any one (1) census tract or in an area bounded by a circle with a radius of one thousand feet (1,000') from a point where three (3) or more census tracts meet, the Department of Construction and Land Use shall notify the City Council.
