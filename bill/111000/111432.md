 AN ORDINANCE relating to the Ethics and Elections Commission; authorizing execution of an interlocal agreement with King County, through its Office of Records and Elections, for publication and distribution of voters' pamphlets, and the application of King County ordinance 11032, Sections 19 and 20 with respect thereto in lieu of Seattle ordinances 117080 and 117159.

 BE IT ORDAINED BY THE CITY OF SEATTLE AS FOLLOWS:

 Section 1. The City Council hereby finds that the bases for the adoption of Ordinance 117080 (Women's & Minority Business Enterprise Utilization, codified as Seattle Municipal Code Ch. 20.46A) and Ordinance 117159 regarding a Women's & Minority Business Enterprise Preference Program for purchases of supplies, material, equipment and non-professional services are substantially the same as those that warranted the adoption by the King County Council of Sections 19 and 20 of King County Ordinance 11032, pertaining to minority/women business enterprise and contract compliance, and procurement and contracting procedures, respectively; and further finds that the administration of City agreement with King County regarding the publication and distribution of voters' pamphlets for elections would be substantially simplified, without any significant change in legislative intent, if such agreement were made subject to and were implemented under King County Ordinance 11032, rather than being made subject to and being implemented under Seattle Ordinances 117080 and 117159. Accordingly, the Interagency Agreement authorized in Section 2 hereof may incorporate and be subject to the provisions of King County Ordinance 11032 dealing with minority/women business enterprise and contract compliance and procurement and contracting procedures notwithstanding any provision to the contrary in Ordinances 117080 and 117159.

 Section 2. The Executive Director of the Ethics and Elections Commission is hereby authorized for and on behalf of the City of Seattle, to execute an interlocal agreement with King County, acting through its office of Records and Elections, substantially in the form of the attached Interagency Agreement, for publication and distribution of voters' pamphlets for elections. Such Executive Director is authorized to act as the representative of the City in connection with the agreement and to make such assurances, representations and reports as may be requested by King County for such purposes.

 Section 3. Any act consistent with the authority and prior to the effective date of this ordinance is hereby ratified and confirmed.

 Section 4. This ordinance shall take effect and be in force thirty (30) days from and after its approval by the Mayor, but if not approved and returned by the Mayor within ten (10) days after presentation, it shall take effect as provided by Municipal Code Section 1.04.020.

 Passed by the City Council the ____ day of October, 1996, and signed by me in open session in authentication of its passage this ____ day of October, 1996.

 ___________________________________ President of the City Council Approved by me this ____ day of October, 1996. _____________________________________ Mayor Filed by me this ______ day of ____________, 1996. _____________________________________ City Clerk (Seal)
