 AN ORDINANCE relating to regulations for environmentally critical areas, amending Sections 25.09.020A, 25.09.180D and 25.09.300D of the Seattle Municipal Code.

 BE IT ORDAINED BY THE CITY OF SEATTLE AS FOLLOWS:

 Section 1. Subsection A of Section 25.09.020 as adopted by Ordinance 116253 is amended as follows:

 SMC 25.09.020 Environmentally critical areas.

 A. This chapter is based on and implements the Seattle Environmentally Critical Areas Policies as adopted by Resolution 28559, and as amended from time to time. This chapter shall apply to all development and platting located in environmentally critical areas as defined below and characterized by specific site conditions. It is expressly the purpose of this chapter to provide for and promote the health, safety and welfare of the general public, and to not create or otherwise establish or designate any particular person or class or group of persons who will or should be especially protected or benefitted by the terms or provisions of this chapter.

 Section 2. Subsection D of Section 25.09.180, as last amended by Ordinance 116976, is amended as follows:

 25.09.180 Development standards for steep slopes.

 D. Steep Slope Exemptions.

 1. Highly Developed Areas. Existing lots, short subdivisions and subdivisions may be exempted by the Director from steep slope regulations when located in highly developed and urbanized areas. Highly developed and urbanized areas include all Downtown and Highrise zones. Sites located in Midrise and Commercial 1 and 2 zones may also qualify for this exemption when surrounding lots contain high-density residential development and/or concentrated commercial development which closely matches the development potential for the zone. This ~~exception~~exemption shall not apply to single-family, lowrise, neighborhood commercial, industrial, or any other zones. If the site is characterized by or adjacent to at least one of the following areas, this exemption shall not apply:

 a. A wetland over one thousand five hundred (1,500) square feet in size, or a stream or creek designated as a riparian corridor;

 b. A large undeveloped steep-slope system; or

 c. Areas designated by the Washington Department of

 Wildlife as urban natural open space habitat areas or other large areas with significant tree cover that provides valuable wildlife habitat.

 2. Steep Slopes Resulting from Rights-of-Way Improvements. Steep slopes resulting from street, alley, sidewalk and other typical rights-of-way improvements, including rockeries or retaining walls, may be exempted from compliance with the environmentally critical areas regulations. This exemption shall not extend beyond the cut or fill created by the street, alley sidewalk or other rights-of-way improvement, and does not release the applicant from any applicable geotechnical review requirements under the Stormwater, Grading and Drainage Code. This exemption shall not be allowed for short subdivision or subdivision applications.

 3. Previously Developed Sites. Sites that have been previously developed may be exempted by the Director from steep- slope requirements under the following conditions:

 a. If the objectives of the steep slope regulations would not be compromised; and

 b. If the degree of nonconformity with the environmentally critical areas regulations, if applicable, is not increased. This exemption shall not be allowed for short subdivision or subdivision applications.

 4. Limited Exemptions. Slopes with a vertical elevation change of up to twenty feet (20') and not part of a larger steep- slope system, or slopes which have been created through previous, legal grading activities, may be exempted by the Director from the steep-slopes regulations based on a geotechnical report demonstrating that no adverse impact will result from the exemption.

5. Stabilization of Landslide-prone Area. Certain steep slopes may be exempted from the steep slope regulations upon the Director's determination, based on geotechnical expertise, that application of the regulations would prevent necessary stabilization of a landslide-prone area, subject to the provisions of Section 25.09.080C, Third-Party Review.

~~5~~6. Any project receiving an exemption shall be subject to steep-slope drainage control and vegetation removal regulations, as well as applicable landslide-prone area regulations of this chapter.

 Section 3. Subsection D of Section 23.09.300 is amended as follows:

 25.09.300 Environmentally critical area exception.

 D. ~~An environmentally critical areas development standard may be reduced, waived or otherwise modified only to the extent necessary to make the standard reasonable in light of all the facts and circumstances of a particular case.~~The relief granted by reduction, waiver, or other modification of an environmentally critical areas development standard shall be the minimum necessary to allow reasonable use of the property. In modifying a development standard, the Director may impose reasonable conditions that prevent or mitigate the same harm that the modified regulation was intended to prevent or mitigate.

 Section 4. This ordinance shall take effect and be in force thirty (30) days from and after its approval by the Mayor, but if not approved and returned by the Mayor within ten (10) days after presentation, it shall take effect as provided by Municipal Code Section 1.04.020.
