 AN ORDINANCE relating to the admission tax; adding a new section to Chapter 5.40 of the Seattle Municipal Code concerning exemptions and amending Seattle Municipal Code Section 5.40.085 to correct a clerical error.

 WHEREAS, in 1989, Ordinance 114708 amended and subdivided Seattle Municipal Code Section 5.40.025 and in that process, SMC 5.40.025A was renamed as SMC 5.40.026A.

 WHEREAS, there was an inadvertent clerical error, and the cross references to SMC 5.40.025A in SMC 5.40.085A and SMC 5.40.085B were not amended at the time of Ordinance 114708.

 WHEREAS, if any exemption from the admission tax is found to be unconstitutional because a court determines it wrongly exempts some events or entities but not others, then that exemption shall be eliminated in its entirety.

 BE IT ORDAINED BY THE CITY OF SEATTLE AS FOLLOWS:

 Subsections A and B of Section 5.40.085 of the Seattle Municipal Code as last amended, are further amended as follows:

 5.40.085 Certificate of exemption - Application, Issuance - Cancellation.

 A. Any person seeking to secure an exemption from the admission tax pursuant to Section ((5.40.025 A3)) 5.40.026A shall, for each activity or series of activities as prescribed by the Finance Director:

 1. Identify the activity or set of activities at which persons paying an admission charge are not to be taxed;

 2. Supply sufficient information as well as enable the Director both:

 a. To determine the applicability of the tax to the activity or set of activities so identified, and

 b. To distinguish the same from other occasions, if any, when taxes are to be collected; and

 3. Provide evidence as necessary to show the status of the party performing the activity or set of activities as a college, university, or nonprofit tax-exempt organization as defined in Section 5.40.010. The applicant may be required to notify the Director of any subsequent change in condition from the facts stated or information supplied. If the Director determines that persons paying such admission charge are not subject to the admission tax, the applicant shall receive a certification of such determination for the activity or series of activities, as the case may be.

 B. The Director may cancel the certificate of exemption of any college, university, or nonprofit tax-exempt organization which (1) secures an exemption from the tax pursuant to Section ((5.40.025 A3)) 5.40.026A by making a false representation in its application, or fails to adhere to its criteria or (2) otherwise violates Section ((5.40.025 A3)) 5.40.026A or a rule or regulation of the Director implementing it. The order of cancellation may bar such an organization from registering again for a period of two (2) years.

 ***

 There is added a new Section 5.40.086 to Chapter 5.40 of the Seattle Municipal Code, as follows:

 5.40.086 Elimination of Exemptions.

 If any exemption from the admission tax is found to be unconstitutional because a court determines it wrongly exempts some events or entities but not others, then that exemption shall be eliminated in its entirety effective on the date of the Court decision.

 The provisions of this ordinance are declared to be separate and severable. The invalidity of any clause, sentence, paragraph, subdivision, section or portion of this ordinance, or the invalidity of the application thereof to any person or circumstance shall not affect the validity of the remainder of this ordinance, or the validity of its application to other persons or circumstances.

 This ordinance shall take effect and be in force thirty (30) days from and after its approval by the Mayor, but if not approved and returned by the Mayor within ten (10) days after presentation, it shall take effect as provided by Municipal Code Section 1.04.020.
