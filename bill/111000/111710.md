 AN ORDINANCE relating to capital projects funding; decreasing certain appropriations in the Concert Hall Fund and Capital Projects Fund, 1992 for low-income housing in the South Lake Union area; reappropriating such funds for a portion of the costs of the Holly Park redevelopment project; and authorizing related agreements.

 WHEREAS, The City of Seattle issued $35,000,000.00 in Limited Tax General Obligation Bonds (Capital Facilities Projects Fund), 1992 under Ordinance 116105 (the "1992 Bonds"), secured by a pledge of Real Estate Excise Tax revenues; and

 WHEREAS, Ordinance 116105 specifies that bond proceeds are to be used for certain capital purposes including housing projects, parks and recreational facilities, open space and health facilities; and

 WHEREAS, the City Council's intent in issuing the bonds was to allocate approximately $25,000,000.00 to low-income housing; and

 WHEREAS, Ordinance 118162 authorized the issuance of up to $26,000,000.00 in limited tax general obligation bonds (the "1996 Bonds") to provide for part of the cost of constructing and equipping a concert hall in downtown Seattle, to provide funds for low-income housing and for other City purposes; and

 WHEREAS, the City has reserved $7,553,849.00 from various housing programs for five low-income housing projects in the South Lake Union area, exceeding the City's commitment under the Capital Facility Bond Program to provide $7,000,000.00 for low-income housing in the South Lake Union area; and

 WHEREAS, a balance of $1,202,685.00 from 1996 Bonds, 1992 Bonds and General Fund moneys remains appropriated for South Lake Union housing but unallocated for specific projects; and
