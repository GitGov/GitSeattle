 WHEREAS, since 1982, the Seattle Repertory Theatre has used and occupied the Bagley Wright Theatre at the Seattle Center, which theatrical facility was constructed with joint City and private funding as contemplated by Ordinance 106629 (1977 Seattle Center Capital Improvement Bond Issue); and

 WHEREAS, the Seattle Repertory Theatre has arranged for the funds necessary to finance the construction and operation of a Second Stage; and

 WHEREAS, the Seattle Repertory Theatre and The City of Seattle have agreed to amend the terms of the lease governing the operation of the existing Bagley Wright Theatre to provide greater programming flexibility for Seattle Repertory Theatre operations while requiring the Seattle Repertory Theatre to assume greater financial responsibility for costs of its operation; and

 WHEREAS, Resolution 29212 authorized Seattle Center to conclude negotiations for a new lease with the Seattle Repertory Theatre, revising the terms governing the existing theater and incorporating a Second Stage; and
