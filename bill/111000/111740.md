The OED Director is authorized, for and on behalf of The City of Seattle, to sign and deliver the Letter of Intent, to negotiate the definitive agreements contemplated by the Letter of Intent consistent with its basic terms, and to execute, deliver and perform such agreements. The City Council finds that the job creation and business growth within the City that may give rise to credits against the DLC's payment obligations to the City under the performance credit provisions contemplated by the Letter of Intent, as generally described in Exhibit C to this Ordinance, will satisfy public purposes of the City, in addition to the purposes of the relevant federal programs. The Mayor or OED Director is authorized to terminate or modify the initial performance credit terms for the DLC as he or she shall deem necessary or appropriate to implement the intent of this Ordinance and protect the interests of the City.

 To the extent provided in the Asset Sale Agreement, and consistent with the Letter of Intent, payments received by the City or its loan servicing agent on the notes sold thereunder, after the closing of the sale of the Portfolio, shall be considered received in trust for the DLC, shall be deposited in the Finance Director's Clearing Account, and upon the direction of the OED Director shall be disbursed to the DLC or deposited in an account established under the Asset Sale Agreement.
