 AN ORDINANCE relating to land use and zoning, amending Sections 25.05.675 and 25.05.800 of Title 25 of the Seattle Municipal Code, to amend the Parking Policy of Seattle's SEPA Ordinance and apply a SEPA categorical exemption threshold to the Seattle Cascade Mixed (SCM) zone designation.

 NOW, THEREFORE,

 BE IT ORDAINED BY THE CITY OF SEATTLE AS FOLLOWS:

 Section 1. Subsection M of Section 25.05.675 of the Seattle Municipal Code, as last amended by Ordinance 116909, is further amended as follows:

 25.05.675 Specific environmental policies.

 M. Parking

 1. Policy Background.

 a. Increased parking demand associated with development projects may adversely affect the availability of parking in an area.

 b. Parking policies designed to mitigate most parking impacts and to accommodate most of the cumulative effects of future projects on parking are included in the City's land use policies5 and implemented through the City's Land Use Code. However, in some neighborhoods, due to inadequate off-street parking, streets are unable to absorb any additional parking spillover. The policies recognize that the cost of providing additional parking may have an adverse effect on the affordability of housing.

 2. Policies.

 a. It is the City's policy to minimize or prevent adverse parking impacts associated with development projects.

 b. Subject to the overview and cumulative effects policies set forth in SMC 25.05.665 and SMC 25.05.670, the decisionmaker may condition a project to mitigate the effects of development in an area on parking; provided, that no SEPA authority is provided to mitigate the impact of development on parking availability in the downtown zones; provided further, that in the SCM zone, no SEPA authority is provided for the decisionmaker to require more parking than the minimum required by the Land Use Code; provided further that with the exception of the Alki area, as described in subsection c. below, parking impact mitigation for multifamily development may be required only where on-street parking is at capacity as defined by the Seattle Engineering Department or where the development itself would cause on- street parking to reach capacity as so defined.

 c. For the Alki area, as identified on Exhibit 29 , a higher number of spaces per unit than is required by SMC 23.54.015 may be required to mitigate the adverse parking impacts of specific multifamily projects. Projects that generate a greater need for parking and that are located in places where the street cannot absorb that need - for example, because of proximity to the Alki Beach Park - may be required to provide additional parking spaces to meet the building's actual need. In determining that need, the size of the development project, the size of the units and the number of bedrooms in the units shall be considered.

 d. Parking impact mitigation for projects outside of downtown zones may include but is not limited to:

 i. Transportation management programs;

 ii. Parking management and allocation plans;

 iii. Incentives for the use of alternatives to single occupancy vehicles, such as transit pass subsidies, parking fees, and provision of bicycle parking space;

 iv. Increased parking ratios; and

 v. Reduced development densities to the extent that it can be shown that reduced parking spillover is likely to result; provided, that parking impact mitigation for multifamily development may not include reduction in development density.

 Section 2. Subsection A of Section 25.05.800 of the Seattle Municipal Code, as last amended by Ordinance 116254, is further amended as follows:

 25.05.800 Categorical exemptions.

 The proposed actions contained in this subchapter are categorically exempt from threshold determination and EIS requirements, subject to the Rules and limitations on categorical exemptions contained in Section 25.05.305.

 A. Minor New Construction - Flexible Thresholds.

 1. The exemptions in this subsection apply to all licenses required to undertake the construction in question, except when a rezone or any license governing emissions to the air or discharges to water is required. To be exempt under this section, the project must be equal to or smaller than the exempt level. For a specific proposal the exempt level in subparagraph 2 of this subsection shall control. If the proposal is located in more than one (1) city/county, the lower of the agencies' adopted levels shall control, regardless of which agency is the lead agency.

 2. The following types of construction shall be exempt, except when undertaken wholly or partly on lands covered by water or unless undertaken in environmentally sensitive areas (Section 25.09.908);

 a. The construction or location of residential structures of four (4) or fewer dwelling units, in all Single Family zones, Lowrise- One (L-1) and all Commercial zones; six (6) or fewer units in Lowrise- Two (L-2) zones; eight (8) or fewer units in Lowrise-Three (L-3) zones; and twenty (20) or fewer units in Midrise (MR), Highrise (HR) , Seattle Cascade Mixed (SCM) and all Downtown zones;

 b. The construction of a barn, loafing shed, farm equipment storage building, produce storage or packing structure, or similar agricultural structure, covering ten thousand (10,000) square feet, and to be used only by the property owner or his or her agent in the conduct of farming the property. This exemption shall not apply to feed lots;

 c. The construction of the following office, school, commercial, recreational, service or storage buildings:

 i. In Commercial-1 (C-1), Commercial-2 (C-2), Seattle Cascade Mixed (SCM), Manufacturing and Industrial zones, buildings with twelve thousand (12,000) square feet of gross floor area, and with associated parking facilities designed for twenty (20) automobiles,

 ii. In all other zones, buildings with four thousand (4,000) square feet of gross floor area, and with associated parking facilities designed for twenty (20) automobiles;

 d. The construction of a parking lot designed for twenty (20) automobiles, as well as the addition of twenty (20) spaces to existing lots if the addition does not remove the lot from an exempt class;

 e. Any landfill or excavation of five hundred (500) cubic yards throughout the total lifetime of the fill or excavation; and any fill or excavation classified as a Class I, II, or III forest practice under RCW 76.09.050 or regulations thereunder,

 f. Mixed use construction, including but not limited to projects combining residential and commercial uses, is exempt if each use, when considered separately, is exempt under the criteria of subparagraph A2a through A2d above, unless the uses in combination may have a probable significant adverse environmental impact in the judgment of any agency with jurisdiction (see Section 25.05.305 A2b);

 g. In zones not specifically mentioned in this subsection, the construction of residential structures of four (4) or fewer dwelling units and commercial structures of four thousand (4,000) or fewer square feet.

 Section 3. If any provisions of this ordinance or its application to any person or circumstance is held invalid, the remainder of the ordinance or the application of the provision to other persons or circumstances is not affected.

 Section 4. This ordinance shall take effect and be in force thirty (30) days from and after its approval by the Mayor, but if not approved and returned by the Mayor within ten (10) days after presentation, it shall take effect as provided by Municipal Code Section 1.04.020.
