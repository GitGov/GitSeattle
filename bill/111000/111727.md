 AN ORDINANCE relating to Seattle parks; providing the Superintendent of Parks and Recreation an additional method for enforcing the Parks Code, the Seattle Municipal Code, and other laws; authorizing administrative suspension of park use by individuals who violate laws and rules in the parks; authorizing hearings on those suspensions; redefining the crime of trespass in parks; establishing the punishment therefor; and amending, repealing and adding sections to Chapter 18.12 of the Seattle Municipal Code.

 BE IT ORDAINED BY THE CITY OF SEATTLE AS FOLLOWS:

 Section There is added a new Section 18.12.025 to Chapter 18.12 of the Seattle Municipal Code as follows:

 18.12.025 Purpose and findings

 The City of Seattle finds as follows, and declares that this ordinance is passed in response to the following facts:

 1. Unlawful and inappropriate behavior in the City's parks diminishes these precious assets and deprives citizens of the full use and enjoyment of the natural beauty, recreational opportunities and peaceful repose that parks are intended to preserve in an urban setting.

 2. In addition to more serious criminal acts that threaten personal injury and property damage, a wide range of illegal disorderly behavior can transform a park into an unwelcoming, unattractive and ultimately unsafe public space requiring increased expenditures for public safety and maintainance.

 3. The laws intended to preserve and protect the parks for the benefit of all are effective only if those who use the parks obey the law. The current criminal and civil penalties for violating the law are frequently inadequate alone to deter illegal behavior, prevent its recurrence or provide for the removal of the offender from the park.

 4. Compliance with the law, including the Parks Code and regulations, will be enhanced by the immediate administrative sanction of excluding from a park those who violate the law. In addition, for repeat offenders and for more serious offenses, exclusion for extended periods of time will provide a necessary additional remedy to protect the parks.

 5. Due to the geographic proximity of some parks, the similarity of some park functions and the potential displacement of illegal behavior from one park to another, it is necessary to provide for exclusion from groups of parks or all parks under certain circumstances.

 Section There is added a new Section 18.12.278 to Chapter 18.12 of the Seattle Municipal Code as follows:

 18.12.278 Park Exclusion

 A. The Superintendent may, by delivering an Exclusion Notice in person to the offender, exclude from a city park zone or zones, anyone who within a city park:

 1. Violates any provision within this chapter, or

 2. Violates any park rule as defined in section 18.12.030, or

 3. Violates any provision of the Seattle Municipal Code or Revised Code of Washington.

 The offender need not be charged, tried, or convicted of any crime or infraction in order for an Exclusion Notice to be issued or effective. The exclusion may be based upon observation by the Superintendent or upon the sort of civilian reports that would ordinarily be relied upon by police officers in the determination of probable cause.

 B. If the offender:

 1. Has not been excluded from any city park zone by an Exclusion Notice issued within one (1) year prior to the violation and the current violation is not a felony violation or weapon violation, then the Superintendent may exclude the offender from the city park zone in which the current violation occurred for a period not exceeding seven (7) days from the date of the Exclusion Notice.

 2. Has been the subject of only one (1) prior Exclusion Notice issued within one (1) year prior to the current violation and neither the current nor the past violation was a felony violation or weapon violation, then the Superintendent shall exclude the offender from the city park zone in which the current violation occurred for a period of ninety (90) days from the date of the Exclusion Notice.

 3. Has been the subject of two (2) or more prior Exclusion Notices issued within one (1) year prior to the current violation, all from the same city park zone in which the current violation occurred, or if the current violation is a felony violation or weapon violation, then the Superintendent shall exclude the offender from the city park zone in which the current violation occurred for a period of one (1) year from the date of the Exclusion Notice.

 4. Has been the subject of two (2) prior Exclusion Notices within one (1) year prior to the current violation and, in combination, the current violation and those prior violations took place in two (2) or more city park zones, then the Superintendent shall exclude the offender from all city park zones for a period of one (1) year from the date of the Exclusion Notice.

 C. The Exclusion Notice shall be in writing and shall contain the date of issuance. The Exclusion Notice shall specify the length and places of exclusion. It shall be signed by the issuing individual. Warning of the consequences for failure to comply shall be prominently displayed on the notice.

 D. Only the Superintendent's Hearing Officer after a hearing may rescind or shorten an Exclusion Notice.

 E. An offender receiving an Exclusion Notice longer than seven (7) days may seek a hearing before the Superintendent's Hearing Officer to have the Exclusion Notice rescinded or the period of exclusion shortened. The request for a hearing shall be delivered to the Superintendent's Hearing Officer or postmarked no later than seven (7) days after the issuance date of the Exclusion Notice. The request for hearing shall be in writing and shall be accompanied by a copy of the Exclusion Notice on which the hearing is sought. The hearing should occur within seven (7) days after the Superintendent's Hearing Officer receives the request for hearing. The Superintendent's Hearing Officer shall take reasonable steps to notify the offender of the date, time, and place of the hearing.

 F. The Superintendent's Hearing Officer may issue subpoenas for the attendance of witnesses and the production of documents, and shall administer oaths to witnesses. The Superintendent's Hearing Officer shall not issue a subpoena for the attendance of a witness at the request of the offender unless the request is accompanied by the fee required by RCW 5.67.010 for a witness in district court. The offender shall be responsible for serving any subpoena issued at the offender's request.

 G. At the hearing, the violation must be proved by a preponderance of the evidence in order to uphold the Exclusion Notice. If the Exclusion Notice was issued because of the alleged violation of any criminal law, the offender need not be charged, tried, or convicted for the Exclusion Notice to be upheld. The Exclusion Notice establishes a prima facie case that the offender committed the violation as described. The Superintendent's Hearing Officer shall consider a sworn report or a declaration under penalty of perjury as authorized by RCW 9A.72.085, written by the individual who issued the Exclusion Notice, without further evidentiary foundation. The certifications authorized in Rule 6.13 of the Criminal Rules for Courts of Limited Jurisdiction shall be considered without further evidentiary foundation. The Superintendent's Hearing Officer may consider information that would not be admissible under the evidence rules in a court of law but which the Superintendent's Hearing Officer considers relevant and trustworthy.

 H. If the violation is proved, the Exclusion Notice shall be upheld; but upon good cause shown, the Superintendent's Hearing Officer may shorten the duration of the exclusion. If the violation is not proved by a preponderance of the evidence, the Superintendent's Hearing Officer shall rescind the exclusion. If the Superintendent's Hearing Officer rescinds an exclusion, the exclusion shall not be considered a prior exclusion for purposes of the Seattle Municipal Code 18.12.278(B).

 I. The decision of the Superintendent's Hearing Officer is final. An offender seeking judicial review of the Superintendent's Hearing Officer's decision must file an application for a writ of review in the King County Superior Court within fourteen (14) days of the date of that decision.

 J. The exclusion shall remain in effect during the pendency of any administrative or judicial proceeding.

 K. No determination of facts made by a person conducting a hearing under this section shall have any collateral estoppel effect on a subsequent criminal prosecution or civil proceeding and shall not preclude litigation of those same facts in a subsequent criminal prosecution or civil proceeding.

 L. This section shall be enforced so as to emphasize voluntary compliance with laws and park rules, and so that inadvertent minor violations that would fall under subsection B.1 can be corrected without resort to an Exclusion Notice.

 Section There is added a new Section 18.12.279 to Chapter 18.12 of the Seattle Municipal Code as follows:

 18.12.279 Trespass in Parks-Definition-Punishment

 A. Any person who knowingly:

 1. Enters or remains in a park from which he or she has been excluded during the period covered by an Exclusion Notice pursuant to SMC 18.12.278; or

 2. Enters, remains in, or is otherwise present within the premises of a park during hours which the park is not open to the public, unless the person is present within the park to participate in an activity either conducted by the Department or conducted pursuant to the terms of a permit issued by the Department;

 shall be guilty of trespass in parks, a gross misdemeanor subject to the provisions of Chapters 12A.02 and 12A.04 of the Seattle Municipal Code.

 B. It is not a defense to the crime of trespass in parks:

 1. That the underlying exclusion issued pursuant to this chapter is on appeal when the excluded person is apprehended, charged, or tried under this section; nor

 2. That the excluded person entered or remained in the park pursuant to a permit that was issued in the name of another person either before or after the date of the Exclusion Notice.

 C. Any person convicted of this crime may be punished by a fine in any sum not to exceed Five Thousand Dollars ($5,000.00) or by imprisonment in the City Jail for a term not to exceed one (1) year, or by both such fine and imprisonment.

 Section Repeal. Section 18.12.277 of the Seattle Municipal Code (Ordinance 113425, Section 20, as last amended by Ordinance 117645, Section 4) entitled "Trespass in the parks" is repealed.
