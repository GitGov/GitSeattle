 AN ORDINANCE relating to the Department of Parks and Recreation; increasing the expenditure allowance in the 1996 budget of the Department of Parks and Recreation, recreating a position and ratifying and confirming prior acts, all by a three-fourths vote of the City Council.

 WHEREAS, Ordinance No. 114900 established the Open Space and Trails Bond Program and authorized acquisition activities for public Green Spaces, and there are unexpended funds from a variety of sources available for Open Space acquisition programmed in prior years; and

 WHEREAS, there are significant remaining Green Spaces within the City of Seattle that need to be acquired to insure their preservation, which is supported by the Mayor, the City Council, the Seattle Citizen's Open Space Oversight Committee and the citizens of Seattle; and

 WHEREAS, the 1996 Budget provided for a staff reduction, presuming the phase down of the Open Space and Trails Bond Program, and in so doing, inadvertently abrogated a position and did not include a sufficient expenditure allowance in the Parks and Recreation Department Budget, each of which are critical to the continuance of the Program and the meeting of its goals, NOW THEREFORE,

 BE IT ORDAINED BY THE CITY OF SEATTLE AS FOLLOWS:

 Section 1. As requested by the Director of the Office of Management and Planning and recommended by the Mayor, the expenditure allowances for the Objects of Expenditure shown below in the 1996 Budget of the Department of Parks and Recreation are increased as follows:

 PS Personal Services $130,588

 OC Other Charges $13,480

 The Parks and Recreation Fund will be reimbursed by the Open Space and Trails Bond Fund and the Conservation Futures Fund for duly authorized acquisition activities.

 Section 2. The following position which was inadvertently abrogated in the 1996 Budget is hereby recreated, effective January 1, 1996, within the Department of Parks and Recreation, and such position is to continue only so long as funding therefor is available from the Open Space and Trails Bond Fund or the Conservation Futures Fund, or other funds identified for land acquisition.

 One (1) Real Property Agent (1FTE)

 and the Director of the Department of Parks and Recreation is authorized to fill the position subject to civil service laws and rules.

 Section 3. Any acts consistent with the authority but prior to the effective date of this ordinance are hereby ratified and confirmed.

 Section 4. The foregoing appropriations are made to meet actual necessary expenditures for the City for which insufficient appropriations have been made due to causes which could not reasonably have been foreseen at the time of the adoption of the 1996 budget; Now, therefore, in accordance with RCW 35.32A.060, by reason of the facts above stated, this ordinance shall take effect and be in force thirty days after its passage approval, if approved by the Mayor; but if not approved and returned by the Mayor within ten (10) days after presentation, it shall take effect as provided by Municipal Code Section 1.04.020.

 Passed by a three-fourths (3/4's) vote of the members of the City Council the _____ day of _______________, 1996, and signed by me in open session in authentication of its passage this ______ day of ____________, 1996.
