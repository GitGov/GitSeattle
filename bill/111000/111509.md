 AN ORDINANCE relating to the I-90 Home Ownership Plan, adopting amendments to such Plan with respect to Phase II tenants; authorizing the purchase from the State of Washington of certain improved real property pursuant to such Plan; and amending Ordinance 116516.

 WHEREAS, the City Council by Resolution No. 27901 passed the 28th day of August 1989, recognized the I-90 Area Development Policies as the basic City policy governing the sale and development of City-owned land in the project area; and

 WHEREAS, by Ordinance 115382, the City Council adopted the I-90 Home Ownership Plan and allocated funds appropriated by Ordinance 114376 to carry out the Plan; and

 WHEREAS, pursuant to Ordinance 116516, the City Council authorized the City to enter into a second land transfer agreement ("Phase II Agreement") to purchase additional surplus real property from the State of Washington, and further authorized issuance to the State of promissory notes of the City for the deferred portion of the purchase price of each improved parcel, the resale of improved parcels, and the making of rehabilitation loans to qualified purchasers of such parcels; and

 WHEREAS, the I-90 Home Ownership Plan stated that it was the City's intent to offer tenants of Phase II properties the same opportunities to remain in their residences as were offered to the tenants of the Phase I properties, but subject to the terms and conditions agreed to by the State and available financing assistance; and

 WHEREAS, amendments to the I-90 Home Ownership Plan are necessary to reflect the terms and conditions agreed to by the State in the Phase II Agreement and available financing assistance; and

 WHEREAS, Ordinance 116516 requires further action by the City Council to authorize purchase of improved parcels at prices exceeding those set forth in Attachment C to the Ordinance; Now, Therefore,

 BE IT ORDAINED BY THE CITY OF SEATTLE AS FOLLOWS:

 Section 1. The I-90 Home Ownership Plan is hereby amended with respect to Phase II properties by adding the following new paragraphs under "GENERAL PROVISIONS" in Section XII of such Plan:

 (8) The provisions for adjustment of sales price, as set forth in Section V, "ACQUISITION", paragraph 4, shall not apply to Phase II properties;

 (9) Deferred payment downpayment assistance loans will be available to qualified Phase II tenants with household incomes not exceeding eighty percent (80%) of median income, adjusted for household size, to finance a portion of the purchase price of the property. The amount of the loan shall be determined based on need, but shall not exceed $40,000 or 40% of the price for the property established by the State under the terms of the Phase II Agreement, whichever is larger. The downpayment assistance loan shall take the form of a promissory note representing a portion of the deferred purchase price payable to the City, and shall replace a portion of the Acquisition Loan otherwise available, as described in Section V of the Plan. The provisions in such Section regarding minimum equity shall remain applicable. Loan term and interest rate shall be the same as specified for rehabilitation loans in this Plan.

 (10) The total amount of deferred loans for a given property shall not exceed $75,000. The maximum loan-to-value ratio, including downpayment assistance, acquisition loan, rehabilitation loan, and all other secured financing, shall not exceed one hundred ten percent (110%) of the after-rehabilitation value of the property as determined by appraisal.

 (11) The downpayment assistance loan will be subordinate to the acquisition loan, and may be subordinated to any rehabilitation loan at the discretion of the Director. However, the Director of Housing and Human Services may combine the downpayment assistance loan with the acquisition loan or with the rehabilitation loan if this is administratively more efficient."

 Section 2. Funds previously appropriated for the I-90 Home Ownership Program, including funds received as repayment of loans made under the Program, may be used for payment to the State of a portion of the purchase price of any Improved Parcels acquired pursuant to Section 3 of this Ordinance or pursuant to Ordinance 116516, as amended hereby. In each case such portion shall equal the amount of each down payment assistance loan as provided herein, plus any other portion of the purchase price not covered by the City's promissory note pursuant to Section 3, and any costs of sale chargeable to the City. The authority in this Section is subject to any restrictions applicable to specific fund sources. Principal and interest received on each downpayment assistance loan shall be deposited in the fund and account from with the funds paid to the State under this Section for the respective Improved Parcel were derived, with appropriate proration if funds from more than one fund or account were used.

 Section 3. The Director of Housing and Human Services ("Director") is hereby authorized, on the conditions stated below, for and on behalf of the City, to purchase the properties set forth in Exhibit A for the prices determined by the State of Washington pursuant to the Phase II Agreement, as shown on Exhibit A. The Director is authorized to execute and deliver, for and on behalf of the City, with respect to each purchase under this Section a promissory note of the City in substantially the form attached to Ordinance 116516 as Attachment D, in the amount of up to 95% of the purchase price, less the amount of any downpayment assistance loan as provided in this Ordinance.

 The Director shall complete each such purchase only if (1) the property is occupied by a tenant household; (2) the tenant has expressed a desire to purchase the property and continue to occupy it as the primary residence of the household; (3) the Director has obtained evidence indicating with a reasonable degree of certainty that the tenant is or will be eligible for City assistance with purchase and/or rehabilitation in accordance with the I-90 Home Ownership Plan, as amended; (4) the Director has obtained evidence indicating with a reasonable degree of certainty that the tenant is financially qualified to purchase the subject property, given the availability of assistance from the City.

 Section 4. The Director is authorized, for and on behalf of the City, to sell and convey each property acquired pursuant to Section 3 to the tenant(s) thereof, and to provide rehabilitation financing, all on terms consistent with the I-90 Home Ownership Plan, as amended by this Ordinance. Except as otherwise provided in this Ordinance, the relevant provisions of Ordinance 116516 shall apply with respect to such sale and rehabilitation financing. Proceeds of sale, including principal and interest on acquisition loans and downpayment assistance loans, shall be deposited in the I-90 Land Transfer Account of the Low Income Housing Fund, except as otherwise stated in Section 2 of this Ordinance. If a tenant eligible for City assistance under the I-90 Home Ownership Plan either cannot qualify financially to purchase the home his or her household currently occupies, or elects not to purchase that home, the Director is authorized to offer to sell and assist the tenant with purchase of any other available I-90 home of equal or lesser estimated after-rehabilitation value.

 Section 5. Section 5 of Ordinance 116516 is hereby amended as follows:

 Section 5. The Mayor or Director or their designees are hereby authorized, on behalf of the City, to sell and convey to authorized purchasers each of the Improved Parcels to be acquired from the State as set forth above, substantially on the terms described in the Plan, as amended by the Ordinance amending this Section~~but without purchase price discounts as described in the Plan, due to the inability of the State to allow discounts to the City~~. Authorized purchasers of such properties shall be any persons whom the Director has determined are qualified in accordance with the terms of the Plan.

 Section 6. The Director is authorized to execute such other documents and perform such other acts, for and on behalf of the City, as may be necessary or appropriate to implement the I-90 Home Ownership Program as amended by this Ordinance.

 Section 7. Any act pursuant to the authority and prior to the effective date of this ordinance is hereby ratified and confirmed.
