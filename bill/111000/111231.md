 AN ORDINANCE accepting the proposal of Novalco Enterprises Inc. to purchase and develop Parcel 29 in the I-90 Redevelopment Project area; authorizing a Contract for Sale of Land and deed; appropriating funds for payment to the State of Washington of the purchase price owing and designating the disposition of sales proceeds; and ratifying and confirming prior acts, all by a three-fourths vote of the City Council.

 WHEREAS, the City Council by Resolution No. 27901, passed the 28th day of August, 1989, recognized the I-90 Area Development Policies as the basic City policy governing the sale and development of City-owned land in the project area; and

 WHEREAS, pursuant to Ordinance 115220 the City has acquired certain parcels of unimproved land from the State of Washington under a Land Transfer Agreement dated August 1, 1990, as amended ("Land Transfer Agreement"); and

 WHEREAS, the Department of Housing and Human Services has conducted a request for qualifications process by which it has identified an interested developer qualified to construct housing on I-90 Parcel 29; and

 WHEREAS, the Department of Housing and Human Services has negotiated terms of a Contract for Sale of Land with Novalco Enterprises, Inc. for the sale and development of I-90 Parcel 29; Now, Therefore,

 BE IT ORDAINED BY THE CITY OF SEATTLE AS FOLLOWS:

 Section 1. That the proposal of Novalco Enterprises Inc. ("Redeveloper") to purchase and develop Parcel 29, legally described as:

 Lots 3, 4, and 5 in Block 1 of Rainier Heights, as per plat recorded in volume 9 of Plats, page 71, Records of King County, EXCEPT portion of said Lots 3 and 4 condemned in King County Superior Court Cause No. 423901, Ordinance No. 78109; situate in the City of Seattle, County of King, State of Washington

 in the I-90 Redevelopment Project area, is hereby found to be in the public interest and in furtherance of the purpose of the I-90 Area Development Policies and the proposal is hereby accepted, subject to the terms of this ordinance and compliance by the Redeveloper with the terms of the Contract authorized in Section 2 of this Ordinance.

 Section 2. The Director of Housing and Human Services ("Director") is hereby authorized to execute, deliver and administer for and on behalf of The City of Seattle a Contract

 For Sale of Land ("Contract") in substantially the form attached hereto as "Exhibit A" with the Redeveloper. The Director is further authorized, for and on behalf of the City, to execute a "Quit Claim Deed" in substantially the form attached hereto as "Exhibit B", and to deliver such deed upon (i) payment to the City of the base purchase price of FORTY SEVEN THOUSAND THREE HUNDRED Dollars ($47,300.00), subject to increase as provided in Section 2.B of the Contract, and subject to possible reduction under Section 404 of the Contract in the event of a required dedication of a portion of the above-described parcel for street purposes, and (ii) satisfaction of the conditions precedent under Section 5 of the Contract.

 Section 3. The Director is hereby designated as the authorized representative of The City of Seattle in connection with the administration of the Contract and is hereby authorized to approve construction plans and changes thereto as being in conformity with the Contract and the I-90 Area Development Policies, to grant such consents and approvals as she shall deem appropriate to carry out the intent of this ordinance, and to issue appropriate certification when improvements contemplated in the Contract have been completed.

 Section 4. Proceeds received by the City from the Redeveloper for the sale of the above referenced parcel shall be deposited in the Low-Income Housing Fund, I-90 Land Transfer Account, except that if the Director determines that a rebate may become payable after closing under Section 404 of the Contract, the Director shall direct that up to TWO THOUSAND EIGHT HUNDRED DOLLARS ($2,800.00) of the proceeds shall be deposited in the Finance Director's Clearing Account. If a rebate shall become payable under Section 404 of the Contract, the Director shall direct that the amount of the rebate be disbursed to the Redeveloper or its assigns from the Clearing Account. Any proceeds remaining in the Clearing Account after any rebate due under Section 404 of the Contract shall have been paid or after that Section shall have expired, whichever is earlier, shall be transferred to the Low- Income Housing Fund, I-90 Land Transfer Account. Upon closing of the sale of such parcel and receipt of the base purchase price (subject to any adjustments thereof pursuant to Section 2 above), the City shall pay from such account in the Low Income Housing Fund to the Washington State Department of Transportation the purchase price of such parcel as determined under the terms of the Land Transfer Agreement, which amount is $39,000.00, plus interest as required under the terms of the Land Transfer Agreement. All necessary appropriations are hereby made and authorized for the timely payment of the amount due to the State from the Low Income Housing Fund. The City Finance Director is authorized to draw and pay the necessary warrants and make the necessary transfers pursuant to this Section.

 Section 5. The City Council finds that, although contracts for the sale of land have been generally exempted by rule from the coverage of the City's Women and Minority-Owned Business ("WMBE") Ordinance, SMC Ch. 20.46A, the purpose of the WMBE Ordinance to remedy the continuing effects of past discrimination in contracting in the construction industry, in projects in which the City of Seattle was involved, applies to the development of the property being sold under this Ordinance. The purpose and foundation for the WMBE Ordinance apply here because the City will require development of the property in a specified manner as an express condition of the sale, and because the development team has been selected through a Request for Qualifications ("RFQ") process. Therefore, the terms of the RFQ process, by which efforts to achieve WMBE participation were included as one factor in the evaluation of the developers, and the terms of the Contract of Sale, by which the buyer is allowed credits against the deferred portion of the purchase price of up to SEVEN THOUSAND ONE HUNDREDHUNDRE DOLLARS ($7,100.00), are necessary in this case to carry out the remedial goals of the WMBE Ordinance. The requirements of the WMBE Ordinance itself will not apply to these contracts or to the development on the property being sold, so long as City funds are not used in such development.

 Section 6. Any act pursuant to the authority and prior to the effective date of this ordinance is hereby ratified and confirmed.

 Section 7. The foregoing appropriation is made to meet actual necessary expenditures of the City for which insufficient appropriations have been made due to causes which could not reasonably have been foreseen at the time of the adoption of the 1996 Budget; Now, therefore, in accordance with RCW 35.32A.060, by reason of the facts above stated, this ordinance shall take effect and be in force thirty days after its passage and approval, if approved by the Mayor; but if not approved and returned by the Mayor within ten (10) days after presentation, it shall take effect as provided by Municipal Code Section 1.04.020. PASSED by three-fourths vote of all the members of the City Council the day of , 1996, and signed by me in open session in authentication of its passage this day of ______________, 1996.
