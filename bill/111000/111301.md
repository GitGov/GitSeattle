 AN ORDINANCE relating to cable television, appropriating new franchise fee revenues, authorizing debt to acquire equipment and increasing the expenditure authority of the Department of Administrative Services and the Library for these purposes; all by a three-fourths vote of the City Council.

 WHEREAS, on January 20, 1996 the City entered into cable franchise agreements with TCI of Seattle, Inc. for the TCI I and TCI II franchise areas, and with Summit Communications, Inc., for the TCI I franchise area; and

 WHEREAS, these franchise agreements call for a new franchise fee as compensation for the right to locate in the public right of way; and

 WHEREAS, the City has passed a franchise extension ordinance that extends Viacom Cablevision's current franchise agreement upon payment of a franchise fee comparable to that paid by TCI and Summit; and

 WHEREAS, the City estimates that revenues from these new fees will be approximately $892,000 in 1996; and

 WHEREAS, the City has identified the following priorities for using these revenues as follows:

 Enhancing community access to two way advanced communication via public schools, libraries, community centers and other public buildings through the acquisition of basic equipment, such as computers and modems, and high speed telephone lines.

 Hardwire returns to the cable head end that will allow schools to publish their own material via cable.

 Training and technical assistance to children and adults in the use of technology and Internet

 Improved public access facilities and services; and

 Increased and better quality coverage of city proceedings and activities through enhancement of the City's government access channel, Channel 28, and

 WHEREAS Channel 28 is currently not staffed to provide the level of Council and public meeting coverage that is appropriate, and recognizing of the plan to reorganize Channel 28 into a consolidated technology division, the addition of permanent employees to Channel 28 is inadvisable at this time and
