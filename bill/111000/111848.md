 AN ORDINANCE relating to the Seattle Financial Management System (SFMS) redevelopment project; authorizing the Executive Services Director to execute a contract with International Business Machines Corporation (IBM) to provide systems integration services for the SFMS redevelopment project.

 WHEREAS, on August 12, 1996, the City Council adopted Resolution 29411, authorizing the issuance of a Request for Proposals for a systems integrator for SFMS Redevelopment;

 WHEREAS, Resolution 29411 envisioned a three phase project, with Phase 1 devoted to developing a long-term financial management system plan and a plan to deal with Year 2000 problems including the selection of the financial software environment, Phase 2 devoted to implementing a fix to the Year 2000 problem, and Phase 3 devoted to implementing other aspects of the long term plan;

 WHEREAS, on December 16, 1996, the City Council adopted Resolution 29507, authorizing the selection of IBM to serve as systems integrator for Phase 1 of the project, which involved the evaluation of options for fixing or replacing SFMS (including the selection of a financial software environment);

 WHEREAS, on June 23, 1997, the City Council adopted Resolution 29596, authorizing the replacement of the Seattle Financial Management System (SFMS) with a new financial management software environment to be acquired from PeopleSoft, Inc., and authorizing the City to conduct contract negotiations with IBM to continue to serve as systems integrator for the project;

 WHEREAS, in compliance with Resolution 29596, the Executive Services Department has negotiated a contract with PeopleSoft, Inc. to acquire this software environment, implementation services, and ongoing maintenance support;

 WHEREAS, on June 30, 1997, the City Council passed Ordinance 118649 authorizing the City to execute a contract with PeopleSoft, Inc. to acquire a financial management software environment, implementation services, and ongoing maintenance support;

 WHEREAS, the PeopleSoft financial management software has been delivered to the City and the City is ready to begin Phase 2 of the project;

 WHEREAS, in compliance with Resolution 29596, the Executive Services Department has negotiated a contract with IBM to provide systems integration services for Phase 2 of the project;

 WHEREAS, the proposed contract includes the following core components of systems integration: IBM responsibility for functional activities including fit analysis and prototyping and significant ongoing leadership for functional issues, IBM responsibility for technical design and architecture, including the provision of significant technical and development resources, IBM expert project management to plan, track, and manage project activities to a successful completion, and an IBM-provided ninety (90) day warranty for interfaces, conversions, modifications and software configuration, covering all software developed by the City and IBM;

 WHEREAS, the proposed contract represents significant savings to the City when compared to earlier project estimates; and

 WHEREAS, the proposed contract provides the City with a viable 24 month schedule that implements the solution safely in advance of the Year 2000 and avoids conflicts with City year end timing;
