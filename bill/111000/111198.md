 WHEREAS, Viacom seeks to suspend negotiations in anticipation of its transfer of control to TCI Communications, Inc.; and

 WHEREAS, the City has agreed to suspend negotiations so long as 1) Viacom commences payment of a franchise fee of 5% of gross revenues, with applicable credits for utility taxes in accordance with the conditions of the Memorandum of Understanding; and 2) the Memorandum of Understanding forms the basis for renewed franchise negotiations should the TCI transfer not take place; and
