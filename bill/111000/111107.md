 B. Review Process.

 1. Review Generally. Approval of a PCD is a "Type IV" land use decision pursuant to Chapter 23.76. Approval of a PCD authorized by this section shall be governed by the procedures for such approval prescribed by Chapter 23.76 and by this section. In the event of a conflict between those procedures, the provisions of this section shall prevail.

The result of the initial park planning process shall be a report which identifies preliminary goals and design objectives for the park, identifies a preferred location for the park on the PCD site, and contains general standards for park improvements and development. The report shall be submitted by the Director to the potential PCD applicant within one hundred eighty (180) days of the date the Parks Superintendent receives the notice of intent to apply.

 c. The purpose of the report is to give the potential project applicant guidance regarding the kind of park which the City may require. The report does not require the applicant to propose the park which is described in the report, and it does not restrict the City's decisions about the park as the PCD review process proceeds.

~~4.~~~~PCD Application. Following receipt of the report the potential applicant may submit an application for PCD approval to the Director. The application shall be on a form prescribed by the Director.~~

~~~~ 4.~~5.~~ Development Guidelines and Project Review. ~~Following receipt of the PCD application~~T~~t~~he Director, in consultation with the Superintendent and the Citizen's Project Review Committee, shall establish development guidelines for the PCD and the public park.

 C. Vested Projects. A holder of a permit for a project which is vested to an earlier code on the effective date of the ordinance codified in this section, may apply for approval of a PCD as provided in this section. The proposed PCD constitutes a new project and, except as provided in this section, is subject to requirements applicable to such projects.

 1. Floor Area. If the holder of a permit for such a vested project applies for PCD approval, the proposed PCD is entitled to the floor area which was vested, provided that if the floor area was attributable in part to the provision of housing or human services public benefit features, then those features must be included as part of the approval of the proposed PCD. If those features are not included, the floor area shall be reduced accordingly.

 2. Credit for Impact Mitigation. To the extent a vested project has provided mitigation for an impact which also would have been attributable to the proposed PCD, the provided mitigation shall be credited against mitigation for the corresponding impact of the PCD.

 3. Annual Limits on Downtown Office Development. If a project which is vested for purposes of this subsection is thereby not subject to the annual limits on downtown office development prescribed by SM~~D~~C Section 23.49.011 the proposed PCD which replaces the vested project is not subject to those limits.

 4. Tolling and Expiration of Vested Permit.

 a. If the holder of a vested permit wishes to apply for approval of a PCD under this section, the running of the expiration period for the vested permit shall be tolled from the date the notice of intent to apply for PCD approval is received by the Director, until the date the City Council makes a final decision to approve or deny the PCD application, or until the earlier date of PCD withdrawal or cancellation as described below. Tolling shall also terminate if the holder fails to submit an application for PCD approval within sixty (60) days of the date the parks report prescribed by of Section 23.49.037 B3 is provided to the holder.

 b. Within thirty (30) days of the date the Director establishes guidelines pursuant to subsection B~~5~~4 of Section 23.49.037, the applicant shall elect to proceed with the PCD application or withdraw the application.

~~i.~~(1) The PCD is denied by the City Council; or

~~ii.~~(2) The PCD is approved with conditions additional to those recommended by the Director's guidelines under subsection B54 of this section, which significantly increase the cost of the park to the applicant relative to the cost estimate contained in the Director's guidelines, or which significantly change the location or footprint of buildings from those contained in the guidelines;

~~iii.~~(3) The PCD is denied as a result of a lawsuit

 If the vested project is resumed as a result of the denial or conditioning under paragraphs i through iii, the running of the expiration period for the vested permit shall resume at the date of the Council decision or final decision by a court, including an appellate court, whichever occurs later.

 d. The PCD approval shall expire as provided in SMC Section 23.76.060. If the holder proceeds under the vested permit, the permit shall expire as provided in the applicable code, subject to the tolling authorized by this section.

 Section 22. Section 23.76.002 of the Seattle Municipal Code, adopted by Ordinance 112522, is amended as follows:

 23.76.002 Purpose.

 The purpose of this ~~c~~Chapter is to establish standard procedures for land use decisions made by The City of Seattle. The procedures are designed to promote informed public participation in discretionary land use decisions, eliminate redundancy in the application submittal process, and minimize delays and expense in appeals of land use decisions.  As required by RCW 36.70B.060, these procedures provide for an integrated and consolidated land use permit process, integrate the environmental review process with the procedures for review of land use decisions, and provide for the consolidation of appeals for all land use decisions.

 Section 23. Subsections A, B and F of Section 23.76.004 of the Seattle Municipal Code, which Section was last amended by Ordinance 117598, are amended and a new subsection G is added as follows:

 23.76.004 Land use decision framework.

 A. Land use decisions are classified into five (5) categories based on the amount of discretion and level of impact associated with each decision. Procedures for the five (5) different categories are distinguished according to who makes the decision, the type and amount of public notice required, and whether appeal opportunities are provided. Land use decisions are categorized by type in Exhibit 23.76.004 A.

 B. Type I~~,~~and II ~~and III~~ decisions are made by the Director and are consolidated in Master Use Permits. Type I decisions are nonappealable decisions made by the Director which require the exercise of little or no discretion. Type II decisions are discretionary decisions made by the Director which are subject to an administrative open record appeal hearing to the Hearing Examiner; provided that Type II decisions enumerated in Section 23.76.006 C 2 shall be made by the Council when associated with a Council land use decision and are not subject to administrative appeal. ~~Type III decisions are discretionary decisions made by the Director which are appealable to the Hearing Examiner and may be further appealed to the Council.~~Type III decisions are made by the Hearing Examiner after conducting an open record hearing and not subject to administrative appeal.

~~F.~~~~Master Use Permits requiring only Type I decisions are categorically exempt from the State Environmental Policy Act (SEPA) and do not require environmental review. All Master Use Permits requiring environmental review include both a Type II SEPA decision (Environmental Impact Statement or Declaration of Nonsignificance and a Type III SEPA decision determination of compliance with SEPA policies). For these projects, SEPA review procedures established in SMC Chapter 25.05, SEPA Policies and Procedures, are supplemental to the procedures set forth in this chapter.~~~~~~

F. Shoreline appeals and appeals of related SEPA determinations shall be filed with the State Shoreline Hearings Board within twenty-one (21) days of the receipt of the decision by the Department of Ecology as set forth in RCW 90.58.180.

G. An applicant for a permit or permits requiring more than one decision contained in the Land Use Decision Framework listed in Section 23.76.004 may either:  1. Use the integrated and consolidated process established in this Chapter;

 2. If the application includes a variance, lot boundary adjustment, or short subdivision approval and no environmental review is required for the proposed project pursuant to SMC Chapter 25.05, SEPA Policies and Procedures, file a separate Master Use Permit application for the variance, lot boundary adjustment, or short subdivision sought and use the integrated and consolidated process established in this Chapter for all other required decisions; or

 3. Proceed with separate applications for each permit decision sought.

 Section 24. A new Section 23.76.005 of the Seattle Municipal Code, is added as follows:

 23.76.005 Time for Decisions

 A. Except as otherwise provided in this section or otherwise agreed to by the applicant, land use decisions on applications filed on or after April 1, 1996 shall be made within the time limits set forth in RCW 36.70B.090.

 B. Exclusions pursuant to RCW 36.70B.140 (1).

 1. Type III decisions.

 a. DCLU shall issue its recommendation within 120 days as that time period is calculated pursuant to RCW 36.70B.090; and

 b. The Hearing Examiner shall issue his or her decision within ninety (90) days of issuance of the DCLU recommendation.

Within fourteen (14) days of receiving the additional information, the Director shall notify the applicant in writing whether the application is now complete or what additional information is necessary. An application shall be deemed to be complete if the Director does not notify the applicant in writing by the deadlines in this section that the application is incomplete. A determination that the application is complete is not a determination that the application is vested. ~~For all Master Use Permit applications, the Director shall mail notice to or otherwise notify the applicant within twenty (20) working days of the application if additional information is required to commence application review.~~~~~~ 2.

The determination of completeness shall not preclude the Director from requesting additional information or studies either at the time the application is determined complete or subsequently, if additional information is required to complete review of the application or substantial changes in the permit application are proposed. A determination under this section that an application is complete for purposes of continued processing is not a determination that the application is vested. A vesting determination shall be made only when needed because of a change in applicable laws and shall entail review of the application for compliance with RCW 19.27.095, RCW 58.17.033, and SMC 23.76.026.

Failure to supply all required information or data within sixty (60) days of a written request may result in a notice of intent to cancel. When a M~~m~~aster U~~u~~se P~~p~~ermit application and a building permit application for a project are being reviewed concurrently, and the applications are for a project vested to prior Land Use Code provisions, and the project does not conform with the codes in effect while it is being reviewed, cancellation of the Master Use Permit application under the provisions of this subsection shall cause the concurrent cancellation of the building permit application.

 E. Notice of Complete Application.

 1. The Director shall determine whether an application is complete and shall notify the applicant in writing within twenty- eight (28) days of the application being filed whether the application is complete or that the application is incomplete and what additional information is required before the application will be complete. Within fourteen (14) days of receiving the additional information, the Director shall notify the applicant in writing whether the application is now complete or what additional information is necessary. An application shall be deemed to be complete if the Director does not notify the applicant in writing by the deadlines in this section that the application is incomplete. A determination that the application is complete is not a determination that the application is vested. ~~For all applications, the Director shall mail notice to or otherwise notify the applicant within twenty (20) working days of the application if additional information is required to commence application review.~~~~~~ 2. An application for a Council land use decision is complete for purposes of this Section when it meets the submittal requirements established by the Director in subsection D of this Section and is sufficient for continued processing even though additional information may be required or project modifications are undertaken subsequently. The determination of completeness shall not preclude the Director from requesting additional information or studies either at the time of the notice of completeness or subsequently, if additional information is required to complete review of the application or if substantial changes in the permit application are proposed. A determination under this Section that an application is complete for purposes of continued processing is not a determination that the application is vested. A vesting determination shall be made only when needed because of a change in applicable laws and shall entail review of the application for compliance with RCW 19.27.095 and SMC 23.76.026.

 F. ~~An application shall be deemed abandoned and void if the applicant has failed without reasonable justification to supply all required information or data within thirty (30) days of a written request for it; provided that the Director may extend the period for submission of the information if it is determined that the delay was not the fault of the applicant~~. Failure to supply all required information or data within sixty (60) days of a written request may result in a notice of intent to cancel. When a Council land use application and a building permit application for a project are being reviewed concurrently, and the applications are for a project vested to prior Land Use Code provisions, and the project does not conform with the codes in effect while it is being reviewed, cancellation of the Council land use application under the provision of this subsection shall cause the concurrent cancellation of the building permit application.

A certificate of approval that is granted for a preliminary design shall be conditioned upon subsequent submittal and Board approval of the final design, including all of the information listed above in subsection B, prior to issuance of permits for work affecting the landmark.

 Section 118. Section 25.12.835 of the Seattle Municipal Code, which was adopted by Ordinance 116540, is amended as follows:

 25.12.835 Demolition.

 A. It is the policy of The City of Seattle to prevent the unnecessary demolition of Landmarks. Even when a certificate of approval to demolish a Landmark has been issued because its owner is unable to make reasonable economic use of the Landmark, demolition should be delayed until the owner is ready and able to proceed with a replacement use. Such delay often will be in the owner's economic interest as well as in the public interest, and a modest additional burden on an owner will be reasonable given the substantial benefit that all citizens, including the owner, derive from the presence of Landmarks within the City.

 B. Unless demolition of a Landmark is ordered for reasons of health and safety by the Director of the Department of Construction and Land Use pursuant to the requirements of SMC Section 23.40.008 B, the Department of Construction and Land Use may complete all other phases of its decision-making process, and may notify the applicant that the permit is ready to be issued when the requirements of this section have been met, but the Department shall not issue a demolition permit for a landmark until:

 1. A decision under Section 25.12.730 granting a certificate of approval to demolish a Landmark has become final after the expiration of any appeal period or the conclusion of any appeal~~, and after the expiration of any period of suspension under Sections 25.12.800 through 25.12.820~~; and

 2. The Landmark has been recorded and documented to the Standards of the Historic American Buildings Survey (HABS) program, as administered by the National Park Service, with copies of the completed HABS documentation provided to the Library of Congress; the Office of Archaeology and Historic Preservation of the State of Washington; the Seattle Public Library; and the Special Collections and Preservation Division of the University of Washington; and

 3. A master use permit is ready to issue for a replacement use or structure other than a temporary use or structure or a replacement use or structure with a floor area ratio (FAR) that is not substantially less than the FAR of the landmark to be demolished; and

 4. The owner demonstrates to the satisfaction of the Director of the Department of Neighborhoods that the owner:

 a. Has a valid and binding commitment or commitments for financing sufficient for the replacement use subject only to unsatisfied contingencies that are beyond the control of the owner other than another commitment for financing; or

 b. Has other financial resources that are sufficient (together with any valid and binding commitments for financing under subparagraph B4a above) and available for such purpose.

 C. Subsections B3 and B4 shall not apply if the owner demonstrates to the satisfaction of the Director of the Department of Neighborhoods that maintaining the landmark until the conditions described in subsections B3 and B4 are satisfied would be unduly burdensome and a violation of substantive due process. Among the facts the Director should consider in determining the burden on the owner are, on the one hand, the costs of maintenance until a replacement use is ready, and, on the other hand, the costs of demolition, the interest on such costs, and the costs of maintaining a vacant site.

 D. The Director also may waive or modify the requirements of subsection B2 if the Director determines that compliance with this subsection would be unnecessary or inappropriate in light of the nature and value of the Landmark.

 E. In making the determinations required under this section the ~~d~~Director of the Department of Neighborhoods is not required to hold a hearing or act as a quasi-judicial officer. The Director should consider all relevant information and should communicate with whomever the Director believes can provide useful information or expertise. The Director shall communicate his or her decision to the applicant in writing within (15) fifteen days of receiving the required information from the applicant. Pursuant to RCW 36.70B.140, the Director's decision is exempt from the time limits and other requirements of RCW 36.70B.060 through section .090, and the requirements of RCW 36.70B.110 through section .130.~~The said decision shall be provisional and subject to comment for thirty (30) days, after which time it shall become finalized as revised, if at all, during the comment period.~~~~~~~~F.~~~~A decision denying an owner permission to demolish a Landmark under subsection C may be appealed by the owner to the Hearing Examiner; all other decisions of the Director of the Department of Neighborhoods under this section shall be final.~~~~Written notice of appeal to the Hearing Examiner and the filing fee specified in Seattle Municipal Code Section 3.02.125 must be filed with the Examiner no later than five p.m. (5:00 p.m.) on the fifteenth day following the date of the Director's decision. Notice of the hearing on the appeal shall be mailed to the owner and Director no fewer than ten (10) days prior to the hearing. The Hearing Examiner shall conduct a hearing de novo and shall not defer to the decision of the Director, although the burden of persuasion shall be on the owner.~~

~~G~~F. An owner may seek to meet his or her burden under subsection C at the same time that the owner seeks a certificate of approval to demolish under Sections 25.12.670 through 25.12.730.~~, in which case any appeal of the decision under subsection C shall be consolidated before the Hearing Examiner with any appeal of the certificate of approval, and, if the owner is entitled to an appeal to the Council under Section 25.12.780, with any appeal to the Council.~~ An owner also may seek to meet his or her burden under subsection C at any time after a certificate of approval to demolish has been issued.

 G. There is no administrative appeal of the decision of the Director of the Department of Neighborhoods. The Director's decision shall be final. Judicial review must be commenced within twenty-one (21) days of issuance of the Director's decision, as provided by RCW 36.70C.040.

 Section 119. Section 25.12.840 of the Seattle Municipal Code, which was adopted by Ordinance 106348, is amended as follows:

 25.12.840 Service of notices.

 A. Notices, decisions, and any other instruments or documents required to be served upon the owner pursuant to this ~~c~~C hapter shall be served by mailing the same: (1) to the person shown to be the owner on the records of the Department of Finance of King County, Washington, to the address therein given and to such other addresses as may be ascertained from telephone or Polk directory listings for the City; and (2) to the owner's attorney where the files or records of the Board, the Hearing Examiner, or the Council, reveal representation in such proceedings by an attorney ~~; and (3) to the person in charge of a site, improvement or object~~. Notices, applications, other instruments or documents required to be served upon the Board shall be served by delivering the same to the Historic Preservation Officer or by mailing the same either to the Historic Preservation Officer or to the Landmarks Preservation Board at the then current address for such Officer or Board. Transmittals by mail shall be sent by first-class mail, certified with return receipt requested and with postage prepaid. Service shall be deemed to have been given when all of the steps specified above have been completed. Failure to send notice by mail to any owner whose address is not listed in the above sources, and failure to give actual notice to any owner whose name and address is unknown, shall not invalidate any proceedings in connection with the proposed designation.

 B. Notice to parties of record shall include at least those documents sent to the owner. Such notice shall be served by first-class mail.

 C. Notice to interested persons of record shall include at least the following: a description of the most recent action taken by the Board, the Hearing Examiner or Council; the time and place of the next public meeting or hearing, if any; the procedure to be followed at such meeting or hearing; the rights of appeal available, if applicable; and the time and place where documents in the record may be inspected.

 B. An interpretation shall be requested in writing, specify the section of the code to be interpreted, and specify the question to be addressed. Requests shall be submitted to the Historic Preservation Officer.

 C. If the requested interpretation relates to a certificate of approval that is subject to the deadlines set by RCW 36.70B, then the request for an interpretation cannot be made any later than fourteen (14) days after the application for the certificate of approval was submitted. Provided, however, that a request for an interpretation may be sought by the applicant at a later time if the applicant agrees in writing to suspend the time frames for review of the certificate of approval, and the time frames applicable to any related permits that are under review, until the interpretation is issued.

 D. Interpretations shall be made in writing by the Historic Preservation Officer, and shall be issued within twenty-five (25) days of submission of the request. The interpretation decision shall be provided to the requesting party, and notice of the decision shall be mailed to parties of record and interested persons of record.

 E. A fee shall be charged for interpretations in the amount provided in the Permit Fee Subtitle of the Seattle Municipal Code, Chapter 22.901E, Table 6, Land Use Fees, and shall be collected by the Department of Neighborhoods.

 F. An interpretation may be appealed by the applicant if the certificate of approval that the interpretation addresses is denied and the applicant is appealing the denial, or if the interpretation relates to conditions placed on the certificate of approval that the applicant is appealing.

 E. A fee shall be charged for interpretations in the amount provided in the Permit Fee Subtitle of the Seattle Municipal Code, Chapter 22.901E, Table 6, Land Use Fees, and shall be collected by the Department of Neighborhoods.

 F. An interpretation may be appealed by the applicant if the certificate of approval that the interpretation addresses is denied and the applicant is appealing the denial, or if the interpretation relates to conditions placed on the certificate of approval that the applicant is appealing. An appeal of an interpretation shall be filed at the same time as appeal of the related certificate of approval, and shall be consolidated with the appeal of the related certificate of approval. Appeal of the interpretation shall proceed according to the same procedures and time frames provided in Section 25.24.080 for appeal of a certificate of approval, including the provisions for consolidation with appeals of any related permit decisions.

 G. The Hearing Examiner shall give substantial weight to the Historic Preservation Officer's interpretation. The appellant shall have the burden of establishing that the interpretation is erroneous.

 H. The Hearing Examiner may affirm, reverse, or modify the Historic Preservation Officer's interpretation, in whole or in part. The Hearing Examiner may also remand the interpretation to the Historic Preservation Officer for further consideration.

 I. The decision of the Hearing Examiner shall be final. The Hearing Examiner's decision shall be binding upon the Historic Preservation Officer and the Commission, as well as all parties of record to the proceeding. Copies of the Hearing Examiner's decision shall be mailed to the Historic Preservation Officer and to all parties of record before the Hearing Examiner. Judicial review must be commenced within twenty-one (21) days of issuance of the Hearing Examiner's decision, as provided by RCW 36.70C.040.

 Section 143. The process of considering whether an improvement, site, or object should be designated a landmark, and of considering the specific controls and incentives that should be applied, presents special circumstances that warrant a different process from that provided in RCW 36.70B. The special circumstances include: 1) Landmark status is not related to a particular permit application, it relates to the building, site, or object and continues independently of whatever permits are granted; 2) Landmarks are public resources, therefore the public must be involved in considering whether landmark status should be assigned; 3) Historic resources require consideration of the long-term, not just the immediate use of a site; 4) Designation does not determine what can or cannot be done with the improvement, site, or object, rather designation requires that approval be given before significant changes or alterations are made; and 5) Controls and incentives result from negotiation, which requires a flexible process. Therefore, pursuant to RCW 36.70B.140, the City is excluding the entire landmark designation process from the time limits and provisions of RCW 36.70B.060 through section .090, and the provisions of RCW 36.70B.110 through section .130.

 Section 144. SMC 25.12.835 and SMC 23.66.115 and SMC 23.66.318 require that the Director of the Department of Neighborhoods determine whether an applicant for a permit to demolish a landmark, or a building in a special review district has a valid and binding commitment for financing sufficient for development of the proposed replacement use or sufficient financial resources for that purpose. This determination presents special circumstances that warrant a different process from that provided in RCW 36.70B. The special circumstances include: 1) An applicant may not be able to obtain a financial commitment until after other permit decisions have been made; 2) Information on financial resources is under the applicant's control. Therefore, pursuant to RCW 36.70B.140, the City is excluding the determination required in sections 25.12.835, 23.66.115, and 23.66.318 from the time limits and provisions of RCW 36.70B.060 through section .090, and the provisions of RCW 36.70B.110 through section .130.

 Section 145. The Council determines that preliminary approval by the City of a subdivision presents special circumstances that warrant exclusion from the time limits of RCW 36.70B.090, and pursuant to the authority of RCW 36.70B.140(1) preliminary approval of subdivisions is excluded from such time limits. The City has defined a subdivision as a division of land into 10 or more lots, and the potential impacts from the creation of so many in-fill lots in one place in a highly developed urban area are such that an open record predecision hearing is needed to examine the public use and interest proposed to be served by the establishment of a subdivision. The Council further determines that a 90 day period, the same time provided by RCW 36.70B.090 for open record appeal hearings, is the minimum period that is reasonable for the Hearing Examiner to conduct such a hearing and issue a decision.

 Section 146. The Council determines that Type IV Council land use decisions present special circumstances that warrant exclusion from the time limits of RCW 36.70B.090, and pursuant to the authority of RCW 36.70B.140(1) Type IV Council land use decisions are excluded from such time limits. Type IV decisions are those in which the Council instead of DCLU or the Hearing Examiner makes the City's decision. The Council does so because of the public interests at issue in such proposals, or because of the potential scale and nature of the impacts of such proposals, or because such proposals present a need to interpret and apply fundamental City policies. Given the Council's other on-going responsibilities, it is not possible for the Council to conduct its own open record hearing or to review and act upon a recommendation from the Examiner within the time limits of RCW 36.70B.090. The Council determines that a 90 day period for the Hearing Examiner to conduct an open record predecision hearing and issue a recommendation, and an additional 90 day period for the Council to conduct a closed record review of the record and recommendation and issue its decision, are the minimum periods that are reasonable.

 Section 147. The Council determines that Major Institution Master Plans are a unique feature of the Seattle Land Use Code and present special circumstances that warrant an entirely different review process from that provided in RCW 36.70B.060 through 36.70B.090 and 36.70B.110 through 36.70B.130, and pursuant to the authority of RCW 36.70B.140(1) the adoption and amendment of Major Institution Master Plans are excluded from such provisions. The Major Institutions Overlay District allows major institutions such as hospitals and universities to develop more intensely than the underlying zone permits so long as the major institution develops consistently with the Master Plan. Not only does the time needed to review and approve a Master Plan depend in large part on the scope and ambition of the major institution's plans, but the creation of a master plan is essentially a legislative act and entails extensive review by and comment from the neighborhoods significantly affected by the institution's development, as well as comprehensive deliberation by the Council.

 Section 148. The Council determines that the City's processes for granting use and occupation permits for public streets and similar public places, including permits for skybridges and tunnels, present special circumstances that warrant a different review process from that provided in RCW 36.70B.060 through 36.70B.090 and 36.70B.110 through 36.70B.130, and pursuant to the authority of RCW 36.70B.140(1) the City's processes for granting such use and occupation permits are excluded from such provisions. A street use permit is a permit to allow private use of public property, and in deciding whether to permit such use the City is not making a regulatory decision pursuant to the police power but is acting as steward of the public interest in public streets.

 Section 149. The Council determines that the process for vacating streets, alleys and public places presents special circumstances that warrant a different review process from that provided in RCW 36.70B.060 through 36.70B.090 and 36.70B.110 through 36.70B.130, and pursuant to the authority of RCW 36.70B.140(1) the process for vacating streets, alleys and public places is excluded from such provisions. Such vacations are not regulatory decisions made pursuant to the police power but essentially legislative decisions made by the Council as steward of the public interest in public streets and places. The City's ability to grant street vacations also is often subject to the rights of others, such as abutting owners, utilities and franchises, and these rights must be recognized and provided for.

 Section 150. The Council determines that applications for land use decisions that the Hearing Examiner or Council remand for further information or analysis present special circumstances that warrant exclusion from the time limits of RCW 36.70B.090, and pursuant to the authority of RCW 36.70B.140(1) such applications are excluded from the time limits of RCW 36.70B.090 for the reasonable period of such remand. The existence of special circumstances such as newly discovered evidence gives rise to the need for a reasonable period of time to address such special circumstances, and such period of time should be excluded from the time limits that would apply absent such special circumstances.

 Section 151. Pursuant to the authority of RCW 36.70B.140(2), the processing of applications for permits required by the following building and construction codes is excluded from the provisions of RCW 36.70B.060 and 36.70B.110 through 36.70B.130:

 A. The Seattle Building Code as adopted in SMC Chapter 22.100;

 B. The National Electrical Code as adopted in SMC Chapter 22.300;

 C. The Seattle Mechanical Code as adopted in SMC Chapter 22.400;

 D. The Seattle Boiler and Pressure Vessel Code as adopted in SMC Chapter 22.450;

 E. The Seattle Plumbing Code as adopted in SMC Chapters 22.500 through 22.506;

 F. The Seattle Fire Code as adopted in SMC Chapter 22.600 through 22.602;

 G. The Washington State Energy Code as adopted in SMC Chapter 22.700

 F. The Stormwater, Grading and Drainage Control Code as adopted in SMC Chapters 22.800 through 22.808, except when an application for a Master Use Permit requires review pursuant to Section 22.802.020.

 Section 152. The Council determines that the process for establishment of criteria for nonschool use of an existing or former public school structure presents special circumstances that warrant a different review process from that provided in RCW 36.70B.060 through 36.70B.090 and 36.70B.110 through 36.70B.130, and pursuant to the authority of RCW 36.70B.140(1) the process for establishment such criteria is excluded from such provisions. The establishment of criteria for joint use or reuse of public schools allows these structures to be occupied by uses other than those permitted outright in the zone as long as the uses are compatible with the surrounding community. This process of developing such substantive criteria entails extensive review and comments from the surrounding community likely to be substantially affected by the joint use or reuse of these public school structures and grounds.

 Section 153. The Council determines that the process for establishment of a development standard departure for public schools presents special circumstances that warrant a different review process from that provided in RCW 36.70B.060 through 36.70B.090 and 36.70B.110 through 36.70B.130, and pursuant to the authority of RCW 36.70B.140(1) the process for establishment of these development standard departures is excluded from such provisions. The development standard departure process for public schools allows public schools to be subject to specific development standards tailored to their unique physical requirements and educational needs, and to the need of the surrounding community. Not only does the time needed to review and approve a development standard departure for public schools depend on the scope of the requested departures, but the review and approval of these departures entail extensive review and comment from the community likely to be affected by the development standard departure.

 Section 154. The following standards are adopted as the "Interim Downtown Design Guidelines" and are to be used to evaluate proposed new structures in the Downtown zones that are subject to Design Review pursuant to Section 23.41.004A, Seattle Municipal Code. The Director of the Department of Construction and Land Use is authorized to clarify, explain and illustrate these guidelines through Director's Rules.

Interim Downtown Design Guidelines

 A. Context:

 1. The project is superior in terms of establishing a superior pedestrian street environment.

 a. Excellent Performance: The project creates a very pleasing and inviting human- scale pedestrian environment through the scale and texture of building materials, size and spacing of windows, street furniture, landscaping, overhead weather protection and eave height; it enhances pedestrian comfort and ease of circulation for people of all abilities, especially up steep hillsides; and the vehicular access to the project contributes in an outstanding way to a well proportioned and well defined street space for pedestrians.

 b. Poor Performance: Negative qualities clearly dominate the design at street level, such as blank famayades, limited, monumental entrances, difficult or disorienting pedestrian access, awkward or circuitous barrier-free access, conflict between vehicular and pedestrian access, or disruption of an existing well defined streetscape or common eave line.

 2. The project is superior in terms of reinforcing the vitality and special character of the part of downtown in which it is located.

 a. Excellent Performance: The scale, design and proposed uses of structures are compatible with and enhance the surrounding area, help unify an area that currently does not have strong consistency of scale, activity, or character, or help change the character of an area in a positive way when such a change would further the goals of the Downtown Land Use Policies.

 b. Poor Performance: The project disrupts the development of a cohesive streetscape or the special character of its surroundings and relates poorly to surrounding buildings, failing either to harmonize or complement.

 B. Siting.

 1. The project is superior in that it preserves downtown's historic and noteworthy buildings and/or respects the character of such nearby structures in its design.

 a. Excellent Performance: The project provides an outstanding, supportive context for nearby historic or noteworthy buildings which are likely to remain, through sympathetic architectural treatment, building massing, and scale; or through preservation of an historic structure, use, or the famayade of an historic structure as a part of the project or through a transfer of development rights.

 b. Poor Performance: The project detracts from the character of nearby historic or noteworthy buildings, or results in the demolition of such structures.

 2. The project is superior in the way it provides or preserves light at street level and in the surrounding area.

 a. Excellent Performance: The project provides for ample amount of sunlight at street level and preserves light for surrounding structures, especially historic or noteworthy ones. Uses slenderness and profile of building mass to avoid or minimize shadow impacts on nearby public spaces or parks.

 b. Poor Performance: The project contributes to a dark canyon-like effect, walling off the street from sunlight most of the day, or substantially shades a public space or parks.

 3. The project is superior due to the quality of the public spaces it enhances or creates, and the appropriateness of its public spaces for the location of the project.

 a. Excellent Performance: The project includes accessible, inviting, usable, well organized and comfortable public space, providing a variety of experiences and generously fulfilling all the requirements. The public space fits well with its surroundings and represents a desirable addition to the city's public spaces.

 b. Poor Performance: Poorly conceived public space where important elements have been badly designed or left out. The public spaces are residual, and/or not appropriate to the character of the area, such as an open space that inappropriately breaks up the street frontage of the retail core or an historic district. Will detract from the ambiance of the city and the hierarchy of public and private spaces.

 C. Design.

 The design of the project is superior in its appearance through the use of materials, building composition and scale, and fenestration, color and detailing.

 1. Excellent Performance: Outstanding qualities of composition, scale, materials, fenestration, and detailing. Few, if any negative qualities. The building fits into the skyline with grace and harmony, and will make an outstanding contribution to the visual quality of the city from close, middle and distant vantages.

 2. Poor Performance: Negative qualities clearly dominate the overall effect such as: awkward or graceless famayades, excessive bulkiness, excessively bland, dull appearance, poor quality of detailing and/or materials. The building will degrade the visual quality of the city.

 Section 155. The provisions of this ordinance are declared to be separate and severable. The invalidity of any particular provision shall not affect the validity of any other provision.

 Section 156. This ordinance shall take effect and be in force thirty (30) days from and after its approval by the Mayor, but if not approved and returned by the Mayor within ten (10) days after presentation, it shall take effect as provided by the Municipal Code Section 1.04.020.

 Passed by the City Council the _____ day of ____________, 1996, and signed by me in open session in authentication of its passage this _____ day of _________________, 1996.
