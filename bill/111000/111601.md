 Section 11. Seattle Municipal Code Section 21.49.080 is amended to read as follows:

 Section 21.49.080. POWER FACTOR RATE (Schedule 81)

 A. When any inductive load causes unsatisfactory conditions on the Department's system due to induction, the Department may, at its discretion, install reactive kVA-hour meters and make a monthly charge in addition to demand and energy charges whenever electricity delivered to the customer has an average monthly power factor of less than 0.95.

Schedule 81

 The monthly charge for average monthly power factors below 0.95 shall be as follows:

 0.14 cents per kVarh

 B. Unless specifically otherwise agreed, the Department shall not be obligated to deliver electricity to the customer at any time at a power factor below 0.85.

 C. The average power factor is determined as follows:

 For application of the Power Factor Rate, the Average Power Factor calculated with this formula will not be rounded.

 D. The meter for measurement of reactive kVA hours shall be ratcheted to prevent reverse registration.

 E. All installations of power factor corrective equipment shall be subject to the approval of the Department. The customer's corrective equipment shall be switched with the load so that at no time will it supply leading reactive kVAs to the Department's distribution system unless written Department approval is obtained to do so.

 F. This monthly charge may be waived in whole or in part to the extent that the Department determines that a power factor of less than 0.95 would be advantageous to the Department or if the addition of corrective equipment would be detrimental to the operation of the Department's distribution systems.

 G. Customers who install new or enlarged arc furnaces shall install static var generators for flicker control and power factor correction for the entire arc furnace load. The generators shall have one-half cycle response time and independent phase control, supply sufficient reactive power to prevent objectionable flicker at the common connection point of the arc furnace with other utility customers, maintain a minimum power factor of 0.95, and be filtered to limit the total harmonic current to no more than the percentage of fundamental current given in "IEEE Recommended Practices and Requirements for Harmonic Control in Electric Power Systems, IEEE- 519," latest revision.

 Section 12. Seattle Municipal Code Section 21.49.090 is amended to read as follows:

 Section 21.49.090.RATE, METER READING, AND BILLING PROVISIONS

 A. Prohibition of Departures from Adopted Rates and Rate Discrimination

 The Department shall have no authority, by express contract or otherwise, to change or vary the schedule of rates and charges established by ordinance or to act in any way that would violate RCW 80.28.080. It shall be the responsibility of the Department to collect any undercharge, whether intentionally or inadvertently made, to prevent preferential treatment in violation of RCW 80.28.090 or rate discrimination in violation of RCW 80.28.100.

 B. Single Meter, Single Service

 All rates in this ordinance apply to electricity supplied through a single meter to individual customers at each building or premises not separated by intervening property, streets, or alleys commonly used as public thoroughfares. At the option of the Department, however, two or more physically and mechanically connected buildings used for a single business function under one ownership may be supplied through one point of delivery and one meter even though they are separated by intervening property or a street or alley. Two buildings merely joined by a walkway or mall across the street, alley, or public thoroughfare will not be allowed a single service and meter for both. In the event two or more premises under one ownership that are physically and mechanically connected, used for a single business function, and supplied through one point of delivery and one meter, undergo a change in ownership, so that each premises is separately owned, each premises will require a single service pursuant to this ordinance. Each building owner(s) will be responsible for the conversion to a single meter at its sole expense. Such conversion will be subject to the installation charges set out in Section 21.49.110(R).

 C. Added Service

 At the discretion of the Department, any additional service supplied to the same customer in the same structure at different voltage or phase shall be separately metered and billed, and the customer shall pay for the installation of the service.

 D. Totalizing Multiple Meters

 The Department may waive the application of rates to each meter and permit the reading of two or more meters at a single contiguous location to be totaled for billing purposes when the Department determines that the maintenance of adequate service and/or that the Department's convenience requires more than one meter for each type of service or load classification.

 E. Single Meter, Multiple Units: Owner/Tenant Billing

 An account with one meter serving more than one unit will be billed to the property owner at City Light's option. When such services are identified, the Department will place the account in the owner's name effective the date of identification, unless the Department determines that another date would be more appropriate. It is the responsibility of the owner/manager to give City Light written notice that the account premises has a split load (i.e., one meter serves multiple units). Any terms and conditions contained in a lease or rental agreement for payment of electric services are not binding on the Department. In the event there is a dispute relating to such lease or rental agreement, the owner/manager shall be responsible for the timely payment for the electric service provided to the account premises. Failure to make such payments shall result in immediate termination of such service.

 F. Rate Schedule Switching

 No more than one change to or from a rate schedule shall be made by the same customer during a 12-month period unless the nature of the customer's electrical equipment or use of electricity changes.

 G. Demand Intervals

 Billing demand shall be the highest recorded demand (expressed in kW) during any 15-minute interval of the billing period, as determined at the Department's option by demand meter with either a fixed or sliding 15-minute interval, periodic load test, or assessment.

 H. Seasonal Proration

 All seasonal rates shall be prorated.

 I. Meter Records; Estimated Meter Reads

 Meters shall be read and bills rendered either monthly or bimonthly as scheduled by the Department. A record of meter readings will be kept by the Department, and the records shall be the basis for determination of bills rendered for metered service. It shall be the customer's responsibility to notify the Department of the date the customer began using the electric service. If the customer fails to notify the Department, the Department shall designate a date for billing purposes. If an accurate meter reading is not obtained for any reason, including, but not limited to, the customer's failure to notify the Department, meter failure, meter reading error, clerical error and/or accounting system malfunction, the meter reading may be estimated by the Department.

 In estimating meter reading (electrical consumption) it is not necessary that the estimate be made with mathematical certainty. The Department shall use standard engineering practices in developing an estimate, which may include but is not limited to regression analysis, customer loads, load comparison, meter conditions and test readings. In cases where estimates cannot be made using standard engineering techniques, the longest periods before and/or after the period of usage may be averaged to arrive at an estimated rate of consumption. In the event a constant margin of error is identified the bill may be adjusted accordingly.

 J. Prorating Nonstandard Meter Reads

 The rate schedules in this ordinance indicate the charges for one month's service. If usage is billed for longer or shorter intervals than normal billing periods, customer bills will be prorated. For purposes of applying demand charges in general service rate schedules, 28 to 35 days shall be considered a normal billing period. Energy charges in residential rate schedules and minimum charges in all rate schedules are prorated on a daily basis. For these charges, 30 days shall be considered a normal monthly billing period.

 K. Billings When the Meter Malfunctions

 If the Department's seal on a meter, meter enclosure, current transformer enclosure, current limiter enclosure, or a terminal box is broken, or if for any reason as determined by the Department a meter does not properly register the electricity used, the customer shall be charged for usage, estimated by the Department pursuant to Subsection I above and billed accordingly.

 L. When Service Is Interrupted

 If the operation of the Department's generating, transmission, or distribution system is suspended, interrupted, or interfered with for any cause including but not limited to suspension or interruption due to planned or unplanned maintenance, Department equipment failure, suspension, interruption, or interference due to droughts, lightning and rain storms, wind storms, floods, fires, strikes, earthquakes, accidents, acts of God, the public enemy, war, governmental regulations, orders or proclamations, laws, mobs, riots, and transportation difficulties, the Department need not deliver electricity and the customer need not accept or pay for electric service for such period of time and to the extent that the suspension, interruption, or interference makes it reasonably impractical to deliver or use electricity. If the operation of the customer's work, plant or establishment is suspended, interrupted or interfered with for any cause reasonably beyond the customer's control, including but not limited to suspension or interruption due to droughts, floods, fires, strikes, accidents, acts of God, the public enemy, war, governmental regulations, orders or proclamations, laws, mobs, riots and transportation difficulties, the customer need not accept or pay for electric service for such period of time and to the extent that the suspension, interruption or interference makes it reasonably impractical to use electricity. Bills for any period including any suspension, interruption, or interference of departmental systems or customer plant or establishment as described above, shall be prorated exclusive of minimum charges.

 Within one week of any interruption, suspension, or interference the customer shall give written notice to the Department to read meters in order to make it possible to prorate billings.

 M. Special Minimum Charges

 A minimum monthly charge other than that specified under a particular rate schedule may be established by the Department to protect the Department's investment and to recover the fixed operating cost associated with providing an electric service.

 N . Average Payment Plan

 Pursuant to the Administrative Code (Seattle Municipal Code Chapter 3.02) the Department shall establish an average payment plan whereby a residential customer's expected billings for the next year may be averaged throughout the year in equal installments which normally shall be adjusted no more than once per calendar year. The Department, however, may adjust the payment level during the year to account for certain exigent circumstances, such as a rate change or a customer's deficit exceeding a certain level. The average payment plan shall be made available upon request to any residential customer of the Department who has established a twelve month billing history on his or her current account, or on the basis of an estimate of consumption satisfactory to the Department. The average payment plan, however, shall cease to be available one year from the date of enrollment in the average payment plan to those residential customers who own their dwelling unit and who use electric heat as defined in Seattle Municipal Code Section 21.52.210 (Ordinance 109675, Section 2) but who have not completed or who are not in the process of completing the energy conservation measures required for participation in the Comprehensive Residential Weatherization Program described in Seattle Municipal Code Section 21.52.260 (Ordinance 109675, Section 8) as of that date.

 O . Overdue Bills and Disconnection

 All charges shall become payable by the due date shown on individual bills. If the charges are not paid, service may be disconnected following reasonable and appropriate notice to the customer by the Department.

 Section 13. Seattle Municipal Code Section 21.49.100 is amended to read as follows:

 Section 21.49.100. APPLICATION AND CONTRACT PROVISIONS

 A. Sole Provider

 In order to ensure safety and system integrity, the customer shall be required to purchase all electricity from the Department or from sources approved by the Department.

 B. Service Contracts and Agreements: Customers' Obligations

 Applicants or customers desiring electric service shall make application to and may be required to sign an application furnished by the Department before service is supplied. Failure to notify the Department of use of service or to sign a contract when requested shall constitute sufficient cause for the Department to disconnect or refuse to provide electric service. Upon acceptance by the Department, the application shall constitute a contract between the Department and the applicant by which the Department agrees to furnish and the applicant agrees to accept and pay for electric service for the premises specified under the rates, terms, and provisions prescribed from time to time by ordinance. In the absence of an application for service or signed contract, the furnishing of electric service by the Department and the use of such service by the customer shall constitute a contract and the

 customer agrees to pay for such electric service under the rates, terms and provisions of the applicable rate ordinance as amended from time to time. The acceptance of application for service by the Department or the use by the customer of electric service provided by the Department will constitute an open and continuous contract for electric services between the Department and the customer.

 The receipt and acceptance of a payment of a periodic billing by the Department does not constitute payment in full for electric service unless it reflects the actual amount of service provided. In the event the bill reflects an amount that is less than the amount of electric service provided, the customer shall be liable for such difference. The customer is liable for all services rendered at the published rate and failure of the utility to bill does not release the customer from such liability. The open and continuing contract remains in effect until terminated by the customer or the Department and the customer will be required to pay any unbilled or underbilled service costs that are billed or rebilled within six (6) years of the date of termination. In the event that a customer uses the electric service provided by the Department but fails to receive billing for service, it shall be the customer's responsibility to notify the Department of the failure to receive a bill. It shall be the customer's responsibility to notify the Department in writing within sixty days from the billing date, if a customer receives a bill on which the customer believes that the wrong rate schedule has been applied or that any other defect in billing exists. The Department assumes no responsibility for retroactive adjustments prior to the bill for which the Department has been provided such written notice.

 C. Department's Obligation to Serve; Customers' Obligation to Pay

 The Department, within its capabilities and under the rates, terms, and provisions of applicable City ordinances, shall supply electric service to all customers upon approval of application for electric service. The customer shall be responsible for all charges under the conditions of the contract and the rates and terms prescribed by ordinance or written Department rules and regulations, and shall be responsible for all charges to the time specified in the application or for the period of occupancy and/or control of the premises. Notice to close an account or disconnect service to any premises shall be given by the customer at any business office of the Department. If the customer does not give prior written notice to the Department to close an account or disconnect service to a premises on a date certain, the Department may bill the customer to a closing date determined by the Department; unless the customer is able to substantiate to the Department's satisfaction, that the customer terminated the use of the Department's electric service at an earlier date. If a tenant properly closes an account and is no longer occupying the space, the closing date will not change regardless of any owner/tenant lease agreement. If a customer fails to close an account, the customer will be responsible up to the date the Department closes the account.

 D. Joint Accounts and Guarantors

 Where more than one person (joint account or guarantor) is named on an electric account, both parties shall be jointly and severably liable for the payment of the electric bill incurred on that account. It shall be the responsibility of a party named on the account to pay in full any existing bill prior to removal of that person's name from that electrical service account. In the event a person (husband, wife, roommate, partner, etc.) is residing at a premise receiving electric service from the Department, that person will be presumed to have used the electric service and will be equally responsible for payment of the electric service bills accumulated during the period of residency. It shall be the responsibility of the person denying responsibility to prove to the satisfaction of the Department that he/she was living elsewhere during the billing period. Such acceptable proofs shall be a combination of the following documents: a properly executed lease or rental agreement, utility bills (water, telephone, gas) for the time period in question and in the name of the person seeking to avoid responsibility.

 E . Condominium Disconnections

 The Department shall not disconnect service to a customer at the request of a Condominium Association for the purpose of implementing RCW 64.32.200(1), the Horizontal Property Regimes Act.

 In the event a facility is operated as a condominium association pursuant to the Horizontal Property Regimes Act (RCW Chapter 64.32) all units will be separately metered. It shall be the condominium association's responsibility to provide, at its sole cost, the necessary entrance service and meter bases required by this ordinance and the Department's Service Requirements.

 F . Contract Violations

 If a customer violates the contract with the Department or orders the closure of an account or service disconnect to any premises, the customer shall be responsible for all loss or damage incurred by the City by reason thereof.

 G . Prohibition of Submetering

 The customer shall not install or use equipment or devices to submeter electricity for the purpose of reselling or otherwise apportioning the costs of electric energy usage except as provided for in Section 21.49.100, Subsection G.

 H . Prohibition of Submetering: Exceptions

 The Department shall not provide electricity to any customer who submeters any part of the electricity for the purpose of resale or apportionment or who otherwise apportions the costs of electric energy use to any other consumer, except that the Department shall permit such resale or apportionment for the following purposes:

 1. Boat Mooring Establishments:

 New or upgraded service to boat mooring establishments shall be master metered. The Department will not provide meters for individual moorage spaces nor directly bill individual boat moorage tenants at a boat moorage establishment where a new service has been installed or an existing service has been upgraded after September 25, 1982.

 Resale by customer operators shall be at an average rate not to exceed the operator's average cost per kWh as billed by the Department and shall not exceed the proportion of the costs for which the boat moorage tenant is responsible.

 2. Mobile Home Parks:

 This exception applies to only those mobile home park operators submetering and reselling electricity as of August 1, 1980. New or upgraded services to mobile home parks will be provided in accordance with written Department rules and regulations.

 Resale by customer operators shall be at an average rate not to exceed the operator's average cost per kWh as billed by the Department and shall not exceed the proportion of the costs for which the mobile home park tenant is responsible.

 3. Other Purposes:

 On a case-by-case basis, the Department may permit a customer, subject to the provisions of Section 21.49.110(I), to submeter for the purpose of apportioning the cost of electric energy. Provided, however, such determination must be based on an objective review and must relate to an economic imbalance relating to service and/or protection of each customer's rights under this ordinance and RCW 80.28.

 I . Applicant and Customer Deposits

 Applicants and customers may be required by the Department to deposit an amount of money to be held as security for payment of all bills and claims during the period of service. The Department may refuse to connect an applicant's service for failure to pay a deposit when requested, and may disconnect a customer's service for failure to pay a deposit when requested. The deposits may be required upon the Department's determination that the financial status or record of the applicant or customer warrants a deposit. Such deposit may not exceed the amount of the bill it is estimated will accrue during two typical billing periods. Upon termination of service, or after 12 billing periods if the customer's credit warrants, the deposits, less any amount owed by the customer, may be returned to the customer. When the deposit is returned, interest will be paid at the rate of 6% per annum on a deposit held longer than six months. Interest payable shall be computed from the first day of the month following the date of deposit to the last day of the month the deposit is refunded.

 J . Vacant Premises

 Property owners shall be responsible for electricity used when the premises are vacant.

 Section 21.49.110. ELECTRIC SERVICE CONNECTION PROVISIONS

 A. Rule-Making Authority

 The Department shall have the authority to adopt and enforce rules and regulations, consistent with this ordinance and the provisions of the Administrative Code (Seattle Municipal Code Chapter 3.02, Ordinance 102228, as amended), for the purpose of carrying out the provisions of this ordinance governing availability of service and materials from the Department. Notwithstanding the repeal of Seattle Municipal Code Chapter 21.48 (Ordinance 109218, as amended), all existing rules and regulations adopted by the Department shall remain in effect until modified or revoked.

 B. Confirmation of Meters

 In buildings with multiple accounts, it shall be the responsibility of each customer (whether building owner, tenant, or agent) to confirm the number of meters installed at the customer's premises and check all meter numbers with the meter numbers on the electric service bill. It is the customer's responsibility to notify the Department in writing within 60 days of any discrepancy in meter numbers. The Department will assume no responsibility for retroactive adjustments due to incorrect meter number where such timely notice has not been received.

 It shall be the responsibility of owners of buildings with multiple accounts, or their agents, to assure that all electric meters are connected to the appropriate apartment, housing unit, or business establishment. Apartments or dwelling unit addresses, including apartment numbers, shall not be changed or reordered without notifying the Department in writing at least 30 days prior to such change or reordering. In the event apartment or dwelling unit numbers or addresses are changed or reordered, the owner or the owner's agent shall notify the Department 30 days in advance of any such change. The Department may visit the site to verify such changes and confirm that each apartment or dwelling unit is connected to the proper meter. For such meter check by the Department, the building owner shall be billed the actual cost required to perform such meter check.

 C . Service Entrance Requirements

 On initial installations or modifications to initial installations, the customer shall provide service entrance equipment which meets applicable Seattle and King County electrical codes and the Department's written rules and regulations. In the event a customer's electric service was installed before Seattle or King County enacted the current electrical code the customer may not be required by the electrical code to upgrade his/her service. It shall be the responsibility of the owner/customer to determine if changes to the electrical system are necessary to receive the safety benefits of the new or amended electrical codes and the National Electric Code. It shall be a violation of this ordinance to connect a building's electrical wiring to the Department's electrical system if the wiring of the building was not authorized by a proper City or County permit, does not meet the applicable existing electrical codes or was not inspected by the proper authority.

 D . Authority and Responsibility for System Design and Construction

 The design and construction of the Department's transmission and distribution system shall be within the sole discretion of the Department; such design and construction shall consider public and employee safety, system efficiency, system uniformity, and the economic impact of such design and construction on electric rates. In the event a customer wants any system (distribution) change for its own convenience or for aesthetics, the utility may at its sole discretion make such system change or modification, provided that the customer shall pay, in advance of construction, the estimated cost of time and materials and the final actual cost when the construction is completed.

 E . Prohibition of Master Metering

 The Department shall not supply electricity for any new service to a duplex or multiple-dwelling building for the purpose of master metering the energy usage of the dwelling units, a central space heating system, or a central domestic water heating system. The Department shall not supply electricity for any larger service to an existing duplex or multiple-dwelling building for the purpose of master metering new central or individual space heating systems.

 Accessory Housing Exception: An owner occupied dwelling unit also containing an additional "accessory housing unit" meeting all provisions as defined in Seattle Municipal Code Section 23.44 and approved by the City of Seattle shall be exempt from the master metering provisions of this ordinance.

 F . Efficiency Standards

 Pursuant to the Administrative Code (Seattle Municipal Code 3.02, Ordinance 102228, as amended) the Department shall adopt rules and regulations to promote conservation of the City of Seattle's electric energy resources by the designation of end-use efficiency standards to limit energy waste from all new or enlarged electric service connections. The Department may also designate end-use efficiency standards to limit energy waste from conversions to electric space heat at existing electric service connections. For the purpose of this section, "end-use" shall be defined as the final conversion of electric energy on the customer's premises into lighting, heating, cooling, and/or other mechanical processes.

 The Department may require compliance with the rules and regulations as a condition for the supply or continued supply of electric service.

 Pursuant to the Administrative Code (Seattle Municipal Code Chapter 3.02, Ordinance 102228, as amended) the Department shall:

 1. Give notice of any public hearings held on proposed

 efficiency standards.

 2. Afford all interested persons an opportunity to present data, views or arguments in regard to proposed efficiency standards.

 3. Give appropriate consideration to economic values, along with any environmental, social, health, and safety factors affecting proposed efficiency standards.

 The Department shall also apply the following specific criteria in developing, reviewing, and adopting all efficiency standards:

 4. Efficiency standards must be cost effective. An efficiency standard shall be considered cost effective if the life cycle costs of complying with the standard are below the incremental system costs of generating, transmitting, and distributing electricity from the least-cost alternative new source of supply.

 5. Efficiency standards must apply equitably to all customers in a customer class.

 6. Efficiency standards must be no more stringent than the City's requirements for new construction.

 In adopting any new or amended efficiency standards after August 1, 1984, the Department may consider including the following requirements:

 7. A requirement that an electric energy analysis be performed.

 8. A requirement that the customer implement the electric energy analysis recommendations.

 9. A requirement that the size of service be limited to that required to serve the intended use of electricity in order to prevent oversizing the service.

 10. A requirement that a customer provide the Department with advance notice of any request for a new or enlarged service connection.

 In the development of each efficiency standard the Department shall solicit technical assistance from the customer class affected by the standard. In addition, the Department shall periodically review and evaluate all efficiency standards designated pursuant to this ordinance and shall revise them as necessary to reflect the changing needs of the Department's generation, transmission, and distribution systems.

 G . Protective Devices

 The Department may require customers to provide on their premises, at their own expense, additional protective devices deemed necessary by the Department to protect the Department's property or personnel, or the property or personnel of the Department's other customers. However, failure to require such protective devices does not relieve the customer of its responsibility to provide the necessary protective devices to protect itself, its property and/or equipment from electrical transients, surges and/or loss of power.

 It is the responsibility of customers using sensitive electronic equipment, computers, and computer peripheral equipment to provide, at their own expense, all protective devices necessary to protect such equipment against electro-magnetic fields, natural and switching transients, power surges, planned power outages, emergency power outages and any other occurrence which occurs on the Department's electrical system that is not within the control of the Department or is due to the natural mechanical failure of any of the equipment utilized to support and operate the Department's electrical system. It is also the customer's responsibility to provide the necessary emergency backup electrical system sufficient to protect the customer's sensitive electronic equipment and provide emergency electrical power as necessary to operate essential personal, business and medical equipment.

It is the responsibility of customers to provide, install, use, inspect, and maintain suitable protection and protective devices to protect themselves, life, and property from any defect, failure, malfunction, and/or electrical fault in or originating in any electrical wiring, current-consuming devices, or other equipment which they may own, operate, install, or maintain; and to protect themselves, life, and property from the consequences of any defect, failure, malfunction, and/or electrical fault in or originating in any electrical wiring, current-consuming devices, or other equipment which they may own, operate, install, or maintain, including protection from surge voltages generated within their premises and generated by lightning, switching, and arcing on the Department's system to the full range of parameters described in "IEEE Recommended Practice on Surge Voltages in Low-Voltage AC Power Circuits, C62.41- 1991," or latest revision.

 Customers may consult with Department personnel, but such consultation shall not absolve customers from any of the responsibilities in this ordinance, nor shall such consultation be relied upon as providing any substitute for professional advice from the customer's own engineers or contractors. It is the responsibility of customers to maintain their electrical systems and to ensure that their electrical service equipment meets all current electrical codes and standards. City Light's responsibility ends and the customer's responsibilities begin at the weatherhead or other point of service as specified by the most recent version of  Requirements for Electric Service Connection.

 The customer's service includes, but is not limited to, electrical service panels and entrance equipment (including meter sockets and enclosures), and ducts, vaults, and handholds on the customer's side of the point of service connection. In the case of failure of or damage to direct buried service conductor, the customer is responsible for digging a trench to facilitate repair of the conductor.

 R . Customers' Liability

 Nothing in this ordinance shall be construed as placing upon the Department any responsibility for the condition, maintenance, or safety of customers' electrical wiring or current-consuming devices or other equipment; and the Department shall not be responsible for any loss or damage resulting from defects, failures, malfunctions, or electrical faults in or originating in any electrical wiring, current-consuming devices, or other equipment which customers may own or operate, install or maintain. The Department shall not be responsible for damage to persons or property arising from the use of electric service on the premises of the customer.

 S . Notification of Added Load

 In order to prevent damage to the Department's equipment and impairment of its service, customers shall give the Department notice before making any additions to their connected load so that the Department, at its option, may provide the facilities which may be necessary for furnishing the increased service. The customer shall be liable for any damages to the Department that may occur and for any additional charges that may accrue as a result of the failure to so notify the Department.

 T . Installation Charges

 Any applicant or customer receiving a new or an enlarged service installation or converting an existing service from an overhead connection to an underground connection shall be charged the material and labor costs incurred by the Department in making the installation less the material and labor costs of transformers and associated network protectors supplied by the Department. The Department shall have the authority to establish standard installation charges representing the average material and labor costs for customers who receive basic service installations which do not require a vault as specified in the Department's Requirements for Electric Service Connection manual. Such standard charges shall be developed pursuant to the provisions of the Administrative Code (Seattle Municipal Code Chapter 3.02, Ordinance 102228, as amended). All applicant(s) or customer(s) receiving the conversion of an existing overhead electrical distribution system to an underground system shall:

 1. reimburse the utility in full for all materials and labor costs in excess of the salvage value of the existing overhead system and conversion costs, if any, from 4 to 26 kV.

 2. reimburse the utility in full for material and labor costs, if any, to underground and/or replace/install streetlights.

 Installation charges are not rates for electrical service and reflect only costs incurred by the Department for new and expanded services.

 U . Losses from Interruptions of Service

 E . Illegal Reconnection

 Whenever the Department disconnects a customer's service for failure to pay or any other violation of this ordinance, the customer is prohibited from reconnecting such service. Upon discovery of an illegal reconnection, the customer's service shall be disconnected at the pole, hand hole, alleycan, or terminal can. The service shall be reconnected by the Department only when all service charges, reconnect fees, and administrative and investigative charges, including interest, have been paid in full or payment arrangements acceptable to the Department have been made.

 F . Penalty for Damage

 Persons who in any way damage Department property, facilities, or equipment may be prosecuted and/or charged for replacement, repair, revenue loss, and administrative costs. In the event the damage occurs on private property, the customer, owner, or person in control of the premises will be presumed to be responsible for the damage.

 G . Current Diversion

 When electricity is diverted around the Department's meter, or when the meter is tampered with or affected so that the meter will not measure and record the full amount of electricity supplied to the customer, owner, or person in control of the premises, the customer, owner, or person will be presumed to be responsible for payment for the electricity which is determined by the Department to have been diverted improperly to his/her own use, and to be in violation of this ordinance. The Department may commence actions for three times the amount of actual damages, if any, plus the cost of the suit and reasonable attorney's fees, plus the costs incurred by the Department on account of meter bypassing, tampering or unauthorized reconnections, as provided in RCW 80.28.

 H . Notification of Defective Service

 The Department shall be notified in case of defective service by the customer, owner, or person in control of the premises.
