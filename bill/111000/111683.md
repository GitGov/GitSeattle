 AN ORDINANCE relating to the City Light Department; authorizing the execution of the letter agreement entitled, BPA Appropriations Refinancing, Public Law 104-134, between the City of Seattle ("City") and Bonneville Power Administration ("BPA").

 WHEREAS, in 1996 the U.S. Congress enacted Public Law 104-134, the 1996 Water Development Appropriations Act (Act); and

 WHEREAS, the Act requires that BPA offer certain contract terms in all its contracts for the sale of electric power, transmission, or related services, which are intended to lock in the terms and conditions under which customers are obligated to repay interest and principal on BPAs old capital investments; and

 WHEREAS, the City currently holds 31 eligible contracts with BPA for power, transmission, and related electrical services which are potentially vulnerable to future Congressional actions that would change the terms of repayment of, or return on, BPAs old capital investments; and

 WHEREAS, the City desires to accept the contract lock language indicated in Section 3 of the letter agreement and amend all of the Citys eligible agreements to protect these contracts from future changes in BPAs investment financing;

 NOW, THEREFORE,

 BE IT ORDAINED BY THE CITY OF SEATTLE AS FOLLOWS:

 Section 1. The Superintendent of the City Light Department is authorized to execute for and on behalf of the City the letter agreement entitled, "BPA Appropriations Refinancing, Public Law 104- 134", substantially in the form of the attached agreement. The letter agreement will amend all eligible power, transmission and related services contracts between the City and BPA to include the contract provisions specified in Section 3201 (i) of the Act, which fixes the interest rate and repayment terms for BPA's old capital investments. These provisions will prohibit BPA from recovering additional investment costs from the City should Congress change BPA's terms for repayment of, or return on, its old capital investments in the future.

 The letter agreement ensures continuing rate stability for transactions performed under our current BPA contracts.

 Section 2. Any other act consistent with the authority and prior to the effective date of this ordinance is hereby ratified and confirmed.

 Section 3. This ordinance shall take effect and be in force thirty (30) days from and after its approval by the Mayor, but if not approved and returned by the Mayor within ten (10) days after presentation, it shall take effect as provided by Municipal Code Section 1.04.020.

 Passed by the City Council the _____ day of ____________, 1997, and signed by me in open session in authentication of its passage this _____ day of _________________, 1997.
