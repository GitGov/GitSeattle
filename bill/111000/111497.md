 AN ORDINANCE relating to the dates of runoff elections for Civil Service and Public Safety Civil Service Employee-Elected Commissioners, amending sections 4.04.250 and 4.08.040 of the Seattle Municipal Code.

 WHEREAS, SMC sections 4.04.250 and 4.08.040 provide that every three years there are elections for the employee-selected commissioners on the Civil Service Commission and the Public Safety Civil Service Commission, and said elections are to be held the week beginning the first Monday in November of the election year, and

 WHEREAS, SMC sections 4.04.250 F and 4.08.040 F provide that if no candidate in an election receives a majority of the votes cast, a runoff election shall be held during the week beginning with the first Monday in December, and

 WHEREAS, SMC sections 4.04.250 and 4.08.040 provide that the City Clerk shall administer the Civil Service and Public Safety Civil Service Employee-Elected Commissioner elections, including conducting the November election, certifying its results, determining whether a run-off election is necessary, publishing the required notice of a runoff election, printing and assembling ballot packages, and sorting and delivering ballot packages to departments for distribution with paychecks to all employees eligible to vote; and,

 WHEREAS, it is extremely difficult for the City Clerk to perform all these duties between the November election and the current December runoff election date, particularly in some elections years because of the way first Mondays fall in the months of November and December; and,

 WHEREAS, the City Clerk can more effectively manage the elections and any necessary runoff elections if he/she has the authority to determine the date(s) for any necessary December runoff elections: and,
