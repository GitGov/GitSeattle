 3. All attachments, including co-lashing, shall be subject to approval of the ExecutiveServices Department ~~of Administrative Services~~, the Engineering Department and the City Light Department in accordance with the following principles, requirements and procedures:

 a. Providing for the safety of the public, City employees, and other users of poles is a fundamental principle which must be observed.

 b. The primary function of the City's poles is to support the City's electrical lines and equipment.

 c. The City shall neither replace existing poles with taller poles nor add crossarms to existing poles to create more communication space on the poles.

 d. Any new attachments must accommodate any prior agreements between the City and other entities regarding use of space on the poles.

 e. The City shall not relinquish the one (1) communication space reserved for its own use on every pole. At the request of the applicant, however, the City shall consider creating additional space for communication uses on the poles by taking such actions as removing secondary rack wiring and substituting triplex wire, moving streetlight fixtures, guy wires and other attachments to the poles and by providing for co- lashing. Any actions undertaken to create more communication space shall be considered make-ready work, and any such costs shall be borne by the applicant.

 f. Approval of attachments may include requirements for extra mitigation measures in certain areas, such as residential, critical areas and shoreline zones, greenbelts, parks, historic districts and viewsheds. All such extra measures, including any additional public involvement and/or environmental review, shall be taken in accordance with directives from the Superintendent of the City Light Department, and all costs associated with such extra measures and review shall be paid by the applicant.

 g. All make-ready costs, including any permit review and environmental review costs, shall be paid by the applicant prior to making any attachments to the poles.

 h. As a condition of securing the City's permission to use its poles for attachment of cable, all applicants shall be required to permit co-lashing to their own cable of up to two (2) other cables, which may be owned and operated by other entities. All cable attachments that initially occupy a space on a City- owned pole shall be required to provide an external or internal support ("messenger") wire that is capable of supporting two (2) other cables in addition to the initial cable installed by the applicant. Owners of cable subsequently co-lashed to the initial cable shall pay the owner of the initial cable a proportionate share of the cost of the messenger wire. All entities co- lashing together shall be required to provide one another with reciprocal indemnity provisions equivalent to those which must be granted to the City by each of them pursuant to Section 15.32.150 . Co-lashing shall not be required of any applicant until all other spaces on the pole, other than the City's reserved space, have been utilized. The City Light Department shall issue a Department Policy and Procedure for providing co- lashing space based on costs, operational convenience, and other criteria which are developed in the course of producing such Department Policy and Procedure.

 i. In addition to the indemnification required by Section 15.32.150 , the City may require that the applicant provide the City and entities permitted to co-lash with additional indemnification, such as indemnification from a parent company, and/or require that the applicant provide proof of specific insurance provisions acceptable to the City which cover potential exposure of both the applicant and the City.

 j. As a further condition of securing the City's permission to use its poles for attachment of cable, all applicants upon request shall be required to provide the City with capacity on the applicant's cable over and above the capacity specifications submitted by the applicant. Such additional capacity may be in the form of dedicated fiber or dedicated space on the same cable being installed by the applicant or in the form of separate cable, as specified by the Executive Services Department ~~of Administrative Services~~, and shall be dedicated to the City for as long as the cable is attached to the City's poles. The City shall have the right to use that capacity for any governmental purpose and the right to lease that capacity to any public or nonprofit entities. The incremental costs of adding the specified amount of capacity for the City shall be borne by the City.

 k. Applications for attachment to City-owned poles shall be submitted to the City Light Department. The City Light Department shall then coordinate that request with the Engineering Department and the ExecutiveServices Department ~~of Administrative Services~~. Approval of all three (3) departments shall be required prior to the issuance of a permit to attach to the poles.

 l. All applications for pole attachment shall be considered on a first-come, first-serve basis, provided that where space is limited, attachment permits shall be given first to public entities, second to entities which act as large-scale common carriers, third to entities which request attachment to six (6) poles or less for their own private communication needs, and fourth to others.

 m. If no space can be created on the poles requested, the applicant may seek an exception to any of the requirements set forth in this section by submitting a written request to a three (3) person review committee comprised of one (1) representative each from the  ExecutiveServices Department ~~of Administrative Services~~ , the Engineering Department and the City Light Department. The committee shall review the request with reference to considerations which may warrant making an exception including, but not limited to reduced environmental effects, the lack of alternatives for achieving equivalent service available to the applicant, the lack of alternative routing which can be made available and the feasibility of undergrounding all or part of the cable. After engaging in a review of the application, the committee shall forward a recommendation to the Mayor and City Council. Any exceptions to the requirements of this section must be approved by ordinance.

 n. All entities that are provided attachments to City-owned poles, including attachments by means of co-lashing, shall pay a use fee for each such attachment at a rate established by ordinance, provided that fees established by prior agreement shall remain in effect until the expiration or termination of such agreement.
