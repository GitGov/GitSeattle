 AN ORDINANCE amending Ordinance 117423, which sets forth compensation adjustments for certain City Light and Engineering positions and revising the effective date for the next compensation adjustment from January 23, 1997, to January 22, 1997, for employees who are supervisors of employees represented by the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers, Local 77.

 WHEREAS, the City of Seattle and International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers, Local 77, as part of a grievance settlement concerning delays in effecting the 1996 general pay increase, agreed to change the implementation date of the 1997 pay adjustment for represented employees by moving it up one day from January 23 to January 22, 1997, the first day of a full pay period; and

 WHEREAS, the City Light Department and Personnel Department have determined the changed pay date, effecting the increase at the beginning of a pay period, will save significant administrative costs in excess of the costs for the additional day of pay at the increased rate, and

 WHEREAS, the City Light Department and the Personnel Director seek to maintain parity for this group of supervisors with the represented employees they supervise and will incur similar savings therefrom; Now, therefore,

 BE IT ORDAINED BY THE CITY OF SEATTLE AS FOLLOWS:

The index used shall be the Consumer Price Index for Urban Wage Earners and Clerical Workers (CPI- W), All Items, Revised Series (1982-4 = 100), for the first half of calendar year 1995 as published by the Bureau of Labor Statistics under the following formula.
