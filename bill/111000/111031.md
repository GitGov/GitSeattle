 AN ORDINANCE relating to the Water Department; authorizing the conveyance and acceptance of deeds, the granting of easements, the acquisition and conveyance of certain other rights, and the execution of closing documents for the Cedar River Watershed land exchange with the United States Forest Service; amending Ordinance 116839 to increase timber sale volume; and increasing expenditure allowances in the 1996 Budget of the Water Department by appropriation of balances accumulating in the Water Fund, all by a three-fourths (3/4's) vote of the City Council.

 WHEREAS, the Cedar River Watershed has been the primary source of water supply for the City of Seattle for almost one hundred years; and

 WHEREAS throughout this one hundred year period, the City has followed the policy of acquiring ownership of lands within the watershed as the primary basis for protecting the high quality water and managing the land and its resources; and

 WHEREAS the Cedar River Watershed Land Exchange Act of 1992 (Public Law 102-453) directs the United States Forest Service to convey to the City the 16,972 acres of forest lands it owns within the watershed's boundaries by exchange for properties owned by the City for this purpose in four National Forests of the state; and

 WHEREAS, the City, by Ordinance 116839 and Resolution 29054, authorized the Superintendent of Water to follow the procedures set forth in P.L. 102-453 to establish the final terms of the exchange, "and to convey and accept deeds to effectuate the exchange;" and

 WHEREAS, more specific authority is needed for the Superintendent of Water to execute the various documents required to close this complex exchange; and

 WHEREAS, in 1994 Ordinance 117307 authorized the sale of certain fire-killed timber on City lands held for exchange in the Wenatchee National Forest and appropriated funds to meet the associated reforestation obligations; and

 WHEREAS, the fire salvage logging sale was completed in 1995 with revenues of more than $2 million, but the 1994 appropriation lapsed because reforestation cannot begin until 1996 and may extend until mid 1998, the full period of obligation under the Washington State Forest Practices Act; and

 WHEREAS, to clear the fire-damaged lands for conveyance, the City must provide for such reforestation by entering into an agreement as provided in Ordinance 117307 and to assure its funding by re-establishing in the 1996 Budget of the Water Department the appropriation for this purpose; and

 WHEREAS, Ordinance 114632, establishing comprehensive management policies for the Cedar River Watershed, provides for harvest and sale of certain second-growth timber under certain limiting conditions, with net revenues to be used only to support the watershed land and habitat acquisition program; and

 WHEREAS, Ordinance 116839 authorized, under terms consistent with this policy direction, the sale of 2.5 million board feet of second growth timber within the Cedar River Watershed; and

 WHEREAS, because the opportunity now exists to sell additional second-growth timber that is down within the Cedar and Tolt River Watersheds and the Lake Youngs Reservation due to wind throw and construction activities, there is a need to amend the volume limit sale area boundaries established by Ordinance 116839; NOW, THEREFORE,

 BE IT ORDAINED BY THE CITY OF SEATTLE AS FOLLOWS:
