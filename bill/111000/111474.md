 For purposes of implementing this chapter, the phrase "moving expenses" includes expenses incurred for transportation to Seattle to secure housing, as well as food and lodging expenses for a period not to exceed five (5) days, incurred while engaged in securing housing. In addition, moving expenses shall include all lodging, food, and transportation expenses of family and household goods and personal effects which are incurred solely for the purpose of relocating, from departure of such family and goods from place of current residence until the time that family and possessions arrive in the City, unless such expenses have been otherwise reimbursed; provided, that nothing in this section shall prohibit the payment of other types of  moving and related expenses as approved by the appointing authority  but in no case shall moving expenses in total exceed the maximum as provided for in Part A of this section.

 A. Effective January 1, 1994, the authorized maximum rate for moving expenses as defined herein shall be eleven thousand nine hundred and eight dollars ($11,908.00). The authorized rate shall be adjusted each year ~~effective January 1st~~ by the annual percentage change in the Seattle-Tacoma Consumer Price Index for the twelve (12) month period ending the previous ~~December 31st~~ June 30th, rounded to the nearest dollar. The revised maximum shall take effect January 1 each year.

 B. Payment for such reimbursement, when authorized, shall be made from unexpended and unencumbered balances accumulating in the budgets of the employing units which eligible persons head or in which such persons serve, and the City Finance Director is authorized to pay the necessary warrants.

 C. The appointing authority shall transact an agreement with an individual for whom travel and moving expenses are extended, which shall stipulate that, should such individual leave the City's employ within twelve (12) months of initial appointment to a position, he or she shall reimburse the employing unit for all such expenses.

 D. The appointing authority shall report all moving expense authorizations

 to the Personnel Director. The Personnel Director shall provide a summary report to the City Council annually demonstrating how department authorization or moving expenses met the administrative guidelines.
