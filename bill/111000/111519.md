 AN ORDINANCE granting the Washington State Major League Baseball Stadium Public Facility District permission to construct, maintain and operate portions of a retractable roof, roof trusses, roof track and a portion of a public tower observation deck located over South Royal Brougham Way, South Atlantic Street and Third Avenue South for a fifty year term, specifying the conditions under which this permit is granted and providing for acceptance of the permit and conditions.

 BE IT ORDAINED BY THE CITY OF SEATTLE AS FOLLOWS:

 Section 1. Subject to terms and conditions of this ordinance, permission is hereby granted to the Washington State Major League Baseball Stadium Public Facility District, its successors and assigns ("Permittee") to construct, maintain, and operate portions of the Washington State Major League Baseball Stadium ("the Ballpark") over street and sidewalk rights-of-way. The portions of the Ballpark for which permission is granted includes the following (dimensions are approximate): six (6) retractable structural roof trusses, extending approximately twenty-five (25) feet into the street right-of-way, and roof trackage extending approximately two (2) feet into the right-of- way, located at an elevation of between 64 feet and 167 feet above street grade, on the south side of South Royal Brougham Way, between First Avenue South and Third Avenue South; a portion of one (1) retractable roof truss extending approximately nine (9) feet into the street right-of-way, and roof trackage extending two (2) feet into the street right-of-way, located at an elevation of between 102 feet and 165 feet above street grade, on the north side of South Atlantic Street, at Occidental Avenue South; and a portion of the retractable structural roof and roof trusses, extending approximately twelve (12) feet into the street right-of-way, located at an elevation of between 138 feet and 238 feet above street grade, on the westerly side of Third Avenue South, between South Royal Brougham Way and vacated South Atlantic Street. This area is necessary for the operation of the retractable roof for the Washington State Major League Baseball Stadium. The public tower observation deck will extend approximately eight (8) feet into the right-of-way, at a point 137 feet above South Royal Brougham Way, from approximately 35 feet to 80 feet east of First Avenue South. The precise dimensions of the Ballpark overhangs, for which permission is granted, will be as set out in the final City approved building permit.

 Section 2. The permission herein granted to the Permittee, it's successors and assigns shall be for a term of fifty (50) years, commencing on the effective date of this ordinance and terminating at 11:59 p.m. on the last day of the fiftieth year, and within ninety (90) days thereafter, the Permittee shall remove said structures located above street rights-of-way, unless the Permittee makes written application and the City Council grants a new ordinance for continued use and maintenance of the structures.

 Section 3. The permit granted hereby is subject to primary and secondary use by the public for travel and utilities purposes, and The City of Seattle ("City") expressly reserves the right to require the Permittee to remove the structures or any portion thereof, at Permittee's sole cost and expense in the event that:

 (a) The City Council determines, by ordinance, that the space occupied by the structures is necessary for any primary or secondary public use or benefit or that the structures interfere with any primary or secondary public use or benefit; or

 (b) The Director of Engineering or official of the City ("Director") determines that any term or condition of this ordinance has been violated, and such violation has not been corrected after notice of violation having been given by the Director.

 A City Council determination that the space is necessary for a primary or secondary public use or benefit shall be conclusive and final.

 Section 4. In the event that the permit is not renewed, or the permission hereby granted extends to its termination in fifty (50) years, or the City orders removal of the structures pursuant to the terms or this ordinance, then within ninety (90) days after such expiration, termination or order of removal, or prior to the date stated in an "Order to Remove", as the case may be, the Permittee shall remove the structures and shall place all portions of the street right-of-way that may have been disturbed for any part of the structures, in as good condition for public use as they were prior to construction, and in at least as good condition in all respects as the abutting portions thereof. Whereupon, the Director shall issue a certificate discharging the Permittee from responsibility under this ordinance for occurrences after the date of such discharge.

 Section 5. The Permittee shall not commence reconstruction, relocation, readjustment or repair of the structures except under the supervision of, and in strict accordance with, plans and specifications approved by the Director. The Director in his/her judgement may order such reconstruction, relocation, readjustment or repair of the structures at the Permittee's own cost and expense because of the deterioration or unsafe condition of the structures, grade separations, or the installation, construction, reconstruction, maintenance, operation or repair of any and all municipally owned public utilities, or for any other cause.

 Section 6. Notwithstanding termination or expiration of the permission granted, or closure or removal of the structures, the Permittee shall remain bound by its obligation under this ordinance until: (a) the structures and all equipment and property are removed from the street right-of-way; (b) the area is cleared and restored in a manner and to a condition satisfactory to the Director; and (c) the Director certifies that the Permittee has discharged its obligation herein. Provided, that upon prior notice to the Permittee and entry of written findings that such is in the public interest, the Director may, in his/her sole discretion, excuse the Permittee, conditionally or absolutely, from compliance with all or any of the Permittee's obligation to remove the structures.

 Section 7. The structures shall remain the exclusive responsibility of the Permittee. The Permittee, by its acceptance of this ordinance and the permission hereby granted, does release the City from any and all claims resulting from damage or loss to its own property and does covenant and agree for itself, its successors and assigns, with The City of Seattle to at all times protect and save harmless The City of Seattle from all claims, actions, suits, liability, loss, costs, expense or damages of every kind and description (excepting only such damages that may result from the sole negligence of the City), which may accrue to, or be suffered by, any person or persons and/or property or properties, including without limitation, damage or injury to the Permittee, its officers, agents, employees, contractors, invitees, tenants and tenants' invitees, licensees or their successors and assigns, by reason of the maintenance, operation or use of said City streets, alleys or any portion thereof, or by reason of anything that has been done, or may at any time be done, by the Permittee, its successors or assigns, by reason of this ordinance, or by reason of the Permittee, its successors or assign, failing or refusing to strictly comply with each and every provision of this ordinance; and if any such suit, action or claim shall be filed, instituted or begun against the City, the Permittee, its successors or assigns, shall, upon notice thereof from the City, defend the same at its or their sole cost and expense, and in case judgment shall be rendered against the City in any suit or action, the Permittee, its successors or assigns, shall fully satisfy said judgment within 90 days after such action or suit shall have been finally determined, if determined adversely to the City. Provided that if it is determined by a court of competent jurisdiction that RCW 4.24.115 applies to this ordinance, then in the event claims or damages are caused by or result from the concurrent negligence of: (a) the City, its agents, contractors, or employees; and, (b) the Permittee, its agents, contractors, employees or its successors or assigns, this indemnity provision shall be valid and enforceable only to the extent of the negligence of the Permittee or Permittee's agents, contractors, employees or its successors or assigns.

 Section 8. The Washington State Major League Baseball Stadium Public Facility District shall require that any and all of its contractors performing construction, reconstruction, repairs, maintenance or other work on the structures as contemplated by this permit, name the City of Seattle as an additional insured on all policies of public liability insurance, and shall include in all contract documents a provision extending construction indemnities and warranties granted to the Washington State Major League Baseball Stadium Public Facility District to the City as well.

 Section 9. The Permittee shall not assign, transfer, mortgage, pledge or encumber any privileges conferred by this ordinance, other than to the major league professional baseball team that will use the Ballpark, without the consent of the City Council by resolution. If permission is granted, the assignee or transferee shall be bound by all of the terms and conditions of this ordinance.

 The permission conferred by this ordinance shall not be assignable or transferrable by operation of law.

 Section 10. The Permittee, its successors and assigns, shall pay to the City such amounts as may be chargeable by said City as costs of inspection of said structures during its construction, reconstruction, repair, maintenance or at other times under the direction of the Director of Engineering. All payments shall be made to the City Finance Director for the credit of the General Fund.

 Section 11. The Permittee shall not discriminate against any employee or applicant for employment in connection with the design, architectural or structural engineering work or the construction, reconstruction, repair or maintenance of the structures pursuant to this ordinance, on the basis of race, religion, creed, color, sex, martial status, sexual orientation, political ideology, ancestry, age, national origin, or the presence of any sensory, mental or physical handicap unless based upon bona fide occupational qualification. The foregoing commitment shall be implemented as follows:

 a. The Permittee will take affirmative action to ensure that applicants are employed and that employees are treated during employment without regard to their race, religion, creed, color, sex, national origin or the presence of any sensory, mental or physical handicap. Such action shall include, but not be limited to, the following: employment, upgrading, demotion or transfer, recruitment or recruitment advertising, layoff or termination, rates of pay or other forms of compensation and selection for training, including apprenticeship.

 b. The Permittee shall post in conspicuous places available to such employees and applicants for such employment, notices setting forth the provisions of this non-discrimination clause.

 c. The Permittee shall furnish to the Director of Human Rights or a successor official, upon his or her request and on such forms as may be provided, a report of the affirmative action taken in implementing this provision and will permit reasonable access to its records for the purposes of determining compliance with this Section. If, upon investigation the Director of Human Rights finds probable cause to believe that the Permittee has failed to comply with any of the terms of this Section, the Permittee and the Director of Engineering (Director) will be so notified in writing. The Director shall give the Permittee at least ten (10) days notice and a hearing thereon. If the Director finds that there has been a violation of this Section, the Director may suspend the permission conferred pending full compliance with the terms of this Section.

 Failure to comply with any of the terms of this provision shall be a material violation of this ordinance.

 The foregoing paragraphs shall be inserted in any subcontracts for work undertaken pursuant to this ordinance in connection with the design, architectural or structural engineering work or the construction of the structures permitted to be constructed and maintained hereunder, unless the Director of Human Rights authorizes the use of another equality of employment opportunity provision.

 Section 12. The Permittee shall deliver its written acceptance of the permission conferred by this ordinance and its terms and conditions to the Director of Engineering within sixty (60) days after the effective date of this ordinance. The acceptance shall be filed with the City Clerk. If no such acceptance is received by then, the privileges provided by this ordinance shall be deemed declined or abandoned; and the permission extended, contingent upon its acceptance, deemed lapsed and forfeited.

 Section 13. This ordinance shall take effect and be in force thirty (30) days from and after its approval, by the Mayor, but if not approved and returned by the Mayor within ten (10) days after presentation, it shall take effect as provided by Municipal Code 1.04.020.
