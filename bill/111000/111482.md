 AN ORDINANCE granting the University of Washington permission to maintain and operate a pedestrian skybridge over and across Northeast Pacific Street, east of Montlake Boulevard Northeast for a ten (10) year term, renewable for two successive ten-year terms, specifying the conditions under which this permit is granted, providing for acceptance of the permit and conditions, and superseding Ordinance 98321.

 BE IT ORDAINED BY THE CITY OF SEATTLE AS FOLLOWS:

 Section 1. Subject to terms and conditions of this ordinance, permission is hereby granted to the University of Washington its successors and assigns ("Permittee") to maintain, and operate a pedestrian skybridge over and across Northeast Pacific Street, approximately 1,250 feet west of Montlake Boulevard Northeast, to be used by the Permittee solely for the purpose of providing overhead access across Northeast Pacific Street. Said pedestrian skybridge is approximately seventeen (17) feet wide, and located sixteen and one half (16.5) feet above maximum street grade.

 Section 2. The permission herein granted to the Permittee, it's successors and assigns shall be for a term of ten (10) years, commencing December 6, 1994 and terminating at 11:59 p.m. on the last day of the tenth year; provided, however, that upon written application of the Permittee at least thirty (30) days before expiration of the term, the City Council may, by resolution, renew the permit for two (2) successive ten (10) year terms, provided further that the total term of the permission as originally granted and thus extended shall not exceed thirty (30) years, subject to the right of the City by ordinance to then revise any of the terms and conditions contained herein.

 Section 3. The permit granted hereby is subject to primary and secondary use by the public for travel and utilities purposes, and The City of Seattle ("City") expressly reserves the right to require the Permittee to remove the pedestrian skybridge at Permittee's sole cost and expense in the event that:

 (a) The City Council determines, by ordinance, that the space occupied by the pedestrian skybridge is necessary for any primary or secondary public use or benefit or that the pedestrian skybridge interferes with any primary or secondary public use or benefit; or

 (b) The Director of Engineering or official of the City ("Director") determines that any term or condition of this ordinance has been violated.

 A City Council determination that the space is necessary for a primary or secondary public use or benefit shall be conclusive and final.

 Section 4. In the event that the permit is not renewed, or the permission hereby granted extends to its termination in thirty (30) years, or the City orders removal of the pedestrian skybridge pursuant to the terms or this ordinance, then within ninety (90) days after such expiration, termination or order of removal, or prior to the date stated in an "Order to Remove", as the case may be, the Permittee shall remove the pedestrian skybridge and shall place all portions of the street that may have been disturbed for any part of the structure, in as good condition for public use as they were prior to construction, and in at least as good condition in all respects as the abutting portions thereof. Whereupon, the Director shall issue a certificate discharging the Permittee from responsibility under this ordinance for occurrences after the date of such discharge.

 Section 5. The Permittee shall not commence reconstruction, relocation, readjustment or repair of the pedestrian skybridge except under the supervision of, and in strict accordance with plans and specifications approved by the Director. The Director in his/her judgement may order such reconstruction, relocation, readjustment or repair of the pedestrian skybridge at the Permittee's own cost and expense because of the deterioration or unsafe condition of the pedestrian skybridge, grade separations, or the installation, construction, reconstruction, maintenance, operation or repair of any and all municipally owned public utilities, or for any other cause.

 Section 6. After notice to the Permittee, the Director may order the pedestrian skybridge closed if the Director deems that it has become unsafe or creates a risk of injury to the public. In a situation in which there is an immediate threat to the health or safety of the public, notice is not required.

 Section 7. Notwithstanding termination or expiration of the permission granted, or closure or removal of the pedestrian skybridge the Permittee shall remain bound by its obligation under this ordinance until: (a) the pedestrian skybridge and all its equipment and property are removed from the street; (b) the area is cleared and restored in a manner and to a condition satisfactory to the Director; and (c) the Director certifies that the Permittee has discharged its obligation herein. Provided, that upon prior notice to the Permittee and entry of written findings that such is in the public interest, the Director may, in his/her sole discretion, excuse the Permittee, conditionally or absolutely, from compliance with all or any of the Permittee's obligation to remove the pedestrian skybridge and its property and restore disturbed areas.

 Section 8. The pedestrian skybridge shall remain the exclusive responsibility of the Permittee. The Permittee, by its acceptance of this ordinance and the permission hereby granted, does release the City from any and all claims resulting from damage or loss to its own property and does covenant and agree for itself, its successors and assigns, with The City of Seattle to at all times protect and save harmless The City of Seattle from all claims, actions, suits, liability, loss, costs, expense or damages of every kind and description (excepting only such damages that may result from the sole negligence of the City), which may accrue to, or be suffered by, any person or persons and/or property or properties, including without limitation, damage or injury to the Permittee, its officers, agents, employees, contractors, invitees, tenants and tenants' invitees, licensees or their successors and assigns, by reason of the maintenance, operation or use of said City street, alley or any portion thereof, or by reason of anything that has been done, or may at any time be done, by the Permittee, its successors or assigns, by reason of this ordinance, or by reason of the Permittee, its successors or assign, failing or refusing to strictly comply with each and every provision of this ordinance; and if any such suit, action or claim shall be filed, instituted or begun against the City, the Permittee, its successors or assigns, shall, upon notice thereof from the City, defend the same at its or their sole cost and expense, and in case judgement shall be rendered against the City in any suit or action, the Permittee, its successors or assigns, shall fully satisfy said judgement within 90 days after such action or suit shall have been finally determined, if determined adversely to the City.

 Section 9. The University of Washington shall require that any and all of its contractors performing reconstruction, repairs, maintenance or other work on the pedestrian skybridge as contemplated by this permit, name the City of Seattle as an additional insured on all policies of public liability insurance, and shall include in all contract documents a provision extending construction indemnities and warranties granted to the University of Washington to the City as well.

 Section 10. The Permittee shall not assign, transfer, mortgage, pledge or encumber any privileges conferred by this ordinance without the consent of the City Council by resolution. If permission is granted, the assignee or transferee shall be bound by all of the terms and conditions of this ordinance.

 The permission conferred by this ordinance shall not be assignable or transferrable by operation of law.

 Section 11. The Permittee, its successors and assigns, shall pay to the City such amounts as may be chargeable by said City as costs of inspection of said pedestrian skybridge during its repair, reconstruction, maintenance or at other times under the direction of the Director of Engineering. All payments shall be made to the City Finance Director for the credit of the General Fund.

 Section 12. The Permittee shall not discriminate against any employee or applicant for employment in connection with the design, architectural or structural engineering work or the repair, reconstruction or maintenance of the pedestrian skybridge pursuant to this ordinance, on the basis of race, religion, creed, color, sex, martial status, sexual orientation, political ideology, ancestry, age, national origin, or the presence of any sensory, mental or physical handicap unless based upon bona fide occupational qualification. The foregoing commitment shall be implemented as follows:

 a. The Permittee will take affirmative action to ensure that applicants are employed and that employees are treated during employment without regard to their race, religion, creed, color, sex, national origin or the presence of any sensory, mental or physical handicap. Such action shall include, but not be limited to, the following: employment, upgrading, demotion or transfer, recruitment or recruitment advertising, layoff or termination, rates of pay or other forms of compensation and selection for training, including apprenticeship.

 b. The Permittee shall post in conspicuous places available to such

 employees and applicants for such employment, notices setting forth the provisions of this non-discrimination clause.

 c. The Permittee shall furnish to the Director of Human Rights or a successor official, upon his or her request and on such forms as may be provided, a report of the affirmative action taken in implementing this provision and will permit reasonable access to its records for the purposes of determining compliance with this Section. If, upon investigation the Director of Human Rights finds probable cause to believe that the Permittee has failed to comply with any of the terms of this Section, the Permittee and the Director of Engineering (Director) will be so notified in writing. The Director shall give the Permittee at least ten (10) days notice and a hearing thereon. If the Director finds that there has been a violation of this Section, the Director may suspend the permission conferred pending full compliance with the terms of this Section.

 Failure to comply with any of the terms of this provision shall be a material violation of this ordinance.

 The foregoing paragraphs shall be inserted in any subcontracts for work undertaken pursuant to this ordinance in connection with the design, architectural or structural engineering work or the repair, reconstruction or maintenance of the pedestrian skybridge permitted to be maintained hereunder, unless the Director of Human Rights authorizes the use of another equality of employment opportunity provision.

 Section 13. The Permittee shall deliver its written acceptance of the permission conferred by this ordinance and its terms and conditions to the Director of Engineering within sixty (60) days after the effective date of this ordinance. The acceptance shall be filed with the City Clerk. If no such acceptance is received by then, the privileges provided by this ordinance shall be deemed declined or abandoned; and the permission extended, contingent upon its acceptance, deemed lapsed and forfeited.

 Section 14. This ordinance shall take effect and be in force thirty (30) days from and after its approval, by the Mayor, but not if approved and returned by the Mayor within ten (10) days after presentation, it shall take effect as provided by Municipal Code 1.04.020.
