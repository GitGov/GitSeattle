 BE IT ORDAINED BY THE CITY OF SEATTLE AS FOLLOWS:

 Section 1. That the City of Seattle (hereinafter referred to as the "City") does hereby grant to Burlington Northern Santa Fe (hereinafter referred to as the "Grantee"), a railway franchise and the right, privilege and authority to locate, lay down, construct, maintain and operate standard gauge railroad tracks in, upon, along and across 20th Avenue West and West Armory Way for a term of thirty years, expiring at 11:59 pm July 7, 2023.

 Section 2. The tracks of standard gauge railway shall be located, laid down, constructed and maintained within a right- of-way described as follows: All that part of 20th Avenue West and all that part of West Armory Way, in the City of Seattle, included between the easterly production of the south line of Lot 2, Block 125 Seattle Tide Lands and the northeasterly margin of West Armory Way lying within 7.5 feet at right angles on each side of the following described centerline: Commencing at a point in said 20th Avenue West on the easterly production of the south line of Lot 2, Block 125 Seattle Tide Lands and distant 7.08 feet westerly thereof from its intersection with the easterly boundary of 20th Avenue West; thence along a 13 degree, 08 minute curve to the right 24.85 feet; thence North 25 degrees, 50 minutes, 40 seconds East, 186.30 feet; thence northeasterly along a 10 degree curve to the left 78.17 feet more or less to a point in the northeasterly margin of West Armory Way, distant North 58 degrees, 51 minutes, 23 seconds East, 214.91 feet from the northeast corner of Block 125 Seattle Tide Lands.

 Section 3. The City of Seattle shall retain the same control of the streets and avenues in and across which said railway tracks shall be laid down as over other streets and avenues in said city, and shall have the right at all times by general ordinance, to regulate the speed of the locomotives, cars and trains within the limits of the franchise right-of-way herein granted, and the maximum period of time for which such locomotives, cars and trains shall be allowed to blockade travel along and across the streets and avenues embraced in this grant, or intersecting streets, and shall have such further control and police power over such franchise rights-of-way and tracks, and the use thereof, as the City Charter and the Federal and State Constitutions and laws may now or hereafter permit. Grantee shall erect and maintain all such safety devices, warning signs and signals, lights and appliances as may be necessary to protect and facilitate public travel across each and every track herein authorized.

 Section 4. The City hereby reserves to itself and its Grantee the right to construct all necessary public improvements and to install and carry all public utility facilities across, underneath or above the tracks hereby authorized, and the City reserves to itself full and complete right of access to any space occupied by such tracks and to all of said franchise right-of-way within the limits of 20th Avenue West, and West Armory Way, together with the right to open and excavate the ground beneath said tracks, or within said franchise right-of-way, for all purposes of construction, maintenance, repair, operation and inspection of any public utilities and public improvements which rights shall, however, be exercised in such manner as not to interfere with the safe operation of locomotives, cars and trains on said tracks. In all cases involving a possibility of such interference, or removal of lateral support or excavation beneath the tracks of the Grantee, sixty (60) days' written notice shall be given the Grantee, and said Grantee shall, at its own cost and expense, remove, relocate, support, reinforce said tracks as necessary, and provide flagging, and shall also furnish an authorized agent or representative at the Grantee's own cost and expense, who shall supervise such removal, relocation, support, reinforcement or excavation or other work; provided that, in case of emergency repairs, the length of such notice may be less than sixty (60) days, but not less than twelve (12) hours. Grantee shall have the option of requiring that any such construction, repair, renewal, maintenance or inspection of municipally owned utility be done by tunnelling or jacking beneath said tracks, if such utility determines that tunnelling or jacking is practicable, and upon Grantee's providing assurances satisfactory to such municipally owned utility that Grantee will pay the extra cost of tunnelling or jacking, over the cost of open cutting. If it is necessary that such tracks should be removed, relocated, supported, or reinforced during the progress of the construction, repair, renewal, maintenance, or inspection of any municipally operated utility, or for any public improvement, the said Grantee shall remove or relocate said tracks and shall construct and place such support and provide a flagman as necessary, and shall attend to the replacement and readjustment of its tracks, all at its own cost and expense.

 Section 5. Grantee shall be solely responsible for the maintenance and safety of the right-of-way granted herein, including all tracks and all grade crossings, and shall cooperate and coordinate with the City of Seattle Director of Seattle Transportation to assure adequate rehabilitation, repair and maintenance of all tracks and grade crossings herein authorized, in compliance with the Letter of Understanding between Burlington Northern Railroad (now Burlington Northern Santa Fe), Union Pacific Railroad and the City of Seattle (City of Seattle Comptroller File No. 296593) dated July 18, 1988, and with all existing and future City of Seattle, State and/or Federal railroad grade crossing standards and regulations, and under the direction of and to the satisfaction of the Director of Seattle Transportation, all at Grantee's sole cost and expense.

 Section 6. Grantee shall construct and maintain the tracks herein authorized so that the top of the rail thereof shall at all times conform to the street grade (except where change is made in separation of grades), and the City hereby reserves the right to change the grade of any streets, avenues or public places at any time, and when the said City shall change such grade the said Grantee, by acceptance of this ordinance, hereby covenants and agrees with the City, to waive any and all damages that it may sustain on account of having to readjust its tracks by reason of such change of grade.

 Section 7. Grantee shall, upon permit issued by the Director of Seattle Transportation or such other body as may in the future be by law authorized to act, allow each owner or occupant of a warehouse or industry contiguous or adjacent to said track herein authorized, or to any street, avenue or other public place along or across which said tracks shall be constructed, a spur track or tracks connecting said track with such warehouse or industry; provided, however, that Grantee may require that such spur track or tracks and all street grading, surfacing or paving appertaining to the right-of-way of such spur track or tracks, be constructed and maintained at the expense of such owner or occupant of such warehouse or industry; and provided further that any such spur track shall start from such point on said track as Grantee shall determine upon as the most proper therefor; and shall be subject to such rules and regulations as to the opening and closing of switches controlling access to and as to the use of said track as Grantee may from time-to-time establish. All of the obligations and duties of Grantee expressed in this franchise shall apply with full force and effect to each and every spur track laid down, constructed, maintained or operated by Grantee connecting with the tracks or right- of-way granted in Section 1 of this franchise.

 Section 8. Nothing contained in this ordinance shall be construed as granting an exclusive franchise or privilege for the use of 20th Avenue West or West Armory Way, or any portion thereof, and the rights granted by this ordinance shall be subject to the right of the City Council to at any time hereafter, to repeal, amend or modify this ordinance and grant, with due regard to the rights of Grantee and of the interests of the public, and to cancel, forfeit and abrogate any right or privilege granted by this ordinance if the franchise hereby granted is not operated in full accordance with the provisions hereof, or at all, and the City reserves the right, at any time during the grant to acquire by purchase or condemnation, for use of the City itself, all the property of the Grantee within the limits of said streets at a fair and just value, which shall not include any valuation of the franchise itself, which franchise shall thereupon terminate.

 Section 9. Except as herein provided, this franchise and the rights herein granted, or any interest in them, shall not be sold, assigned or mortgaged without the consent of the City by ordinance. Nor shall the same in such event accrue to the benefit of the purchaser, assignee or mortgagee unless within sixty (60) days after such consent it or they shall file with the Finance Department and City Clerk of the City of Seattle an acceptance of all the rights, privileges and authorities hereby granted, subject to all the conditions, restrictions, specifications and requirements herein expressed. Provided, that the rights acquired hereunder shall be deemed appurtenant to and running with the railroad system of the Grantee, and may be sold, assigned, leased or mortgaged as an entirety in connection with and as a part of said railroad system without such consent or acceptance.

 Section 10. Grantee, by its acceptance of this grant, does agree and covenant for itself, to protect, indemnify and save harmless The City of Seattle from all claims, actions suits, liability, loss, costs, expenses or damages of every kind and description which may accrue to, or be suffered by, any person or persons, or property, including without limitation damage or injury to the Grantee, its officers, agents, employees, contractors, successors and assigns, arising in any way from, or alleged to arise from, or by reason of any of the following:

 (1) The operation, loading, unloading or use of any and all locomotives, cars, trains, railroad equipment or other machinery and railway vehicles in or over said right-of-way;

 (2) Any defective, unsafe or misleading condition created, caused or contributed to by Grantee in or on said right-of-way and/or railroad tracks, or condition which endangers the safety, use of or travel upon or across said right-of-way;

 (3) Any deficiency in the construction, maintenance or operation of any barricades, fences, signs, signals, warning devices and other protective devices that the Grantee is required to establish or maintain, by law, by ordinance or mutual agreement with the City;

 (4) The actions, negligence, or omissions of the Grantee, its forces, agents, contractors, or any of them, in or using said right- of-way;

 (5) Damage to any municipally owned utility within the franchise right-of-way, and any resulting damages for which said municipally owned utility may be liable to any person, persons or property because of damage to said municipally owned utility, including without limitation: flooding from broken watermains, storm drains or sewers, electrical damage, interruption of municipally owned utility service, resulting from the construction, maintenance or operation of the railroad and rail equipment within the franchise right-of-way.

 The above liability shall not be diminished by the fact, if it be a fact, that any such death, injury, damages, loss, cost or expense may have been contributed to, or alleged to have been contributed to, by the negligence of the City, its agents or employees; provided, however, that nothing herein contained shall be construed as requiring the Grantee to indemnify the City against liability for damages arising out of bodily injury to persons or damage to property caused by or resulting from the sole negligence of the City.

 Upon commencement of any such suit or action against the City, the Grantee shall upon notice, defend the same at its sole cost and expense, and in case judgement shall be rendered against the City in such action or suit, shall fully satisfy such judgement within ninety (90) days after such action or suit shall have been finally determined, if determined adversely to the City.

 Section 11. Grantee, by its acceptance of this ordinance, does covenant and agree with the City of Seattle, that whenever the City of Seattle separates the grades of existing or future streets by the construction, reconstruction, renewal, maintenance, and/or widening of any overhead structure across the right-of-way herein granted, Grantee will bear its proportionate share of all costs incident to the span crossing said right-of-way and the piers or abutments supporting such span. Such proportionate share shall be determined on the ratio the length of the portion of the span crossing said right-of-way bears to the total length of said span, and Grantee will pay its aforesaid share upon proper billing therefore by the Director of Seattle Transportation.

 Section 12. That any other railway company having heretofore constructed or hereafter constructing a standard gauge railway to or in the City of Seattle, upon obtaining a franchise from the City giving access to any point therein from which it can reach with its engines and cars any point upon the track laid upon the right-of-way hereinabove described, or any portion thereof, shall, subject to all the provisions and requirements of this ordinance, have the right to the common use with Grantee of the track constructed upon the right- of-way herein granted, or any portion of said track, upon the payment of such monthly or annual rental or other compensation as may be just and equitable, and subject to such reasonable rules and regulations as may be consistent with the prior rights of the Grantee, and shall not unnecessarily interfere with or impede the transaction and dispatch of the business of Grantee. In case such railway company cannot agree with Grantee upon the rental or compensation to be paid for such use of said track, or upon the reasonable rules and regulations of such use, any controversy or difference between them respecting the proper amount of such rental or other compensation, or respecting the rules and regulations of such use, shall be submitted to arbitration in conformity to the laws of the State of Washington in that regard, and said submission shall have the same force and binding effect upon the parties thereto as shall be provided by such law in all other cases of arbitration.

 Section 13. In order to claim the benefits of this ordinance and to acquire the rights, privileges and authorities hereby granted, Grantee must, within six (6) months after this ordinance becomes effective file in the office of the City of Seattle Finance Department and City Clerk a copy of a resolution duly adopted by its Board of Directors, or by the Executive Committee of said Board, which copy shall be duly certified and attested by its proper officer, under its corporate seal, accepting the benefits of this ordinance, and the rights, privileges and authorities hereby granted, subject to all the conditions, restrictions, specifications and requirements expressed.

 Section 14. The franchise hereby granted relates back to the date of expiration of the franchise granted by Ordinance 98117 and any acts undertaken consistent with the authority and prior to the effective date of this ordinance are hereby ratified and confirmed.

 Section 15. This ordinance shall take effect and be in force thirty (30) days from and after its approval by the Mayor, but if not approved and returned by the Mayor within ten (10) days after its presentation, it shall take effect as provided by Seattle Municipal Code 1.04.020.
