 AN ORDINANCE relating to regulations for environmentally critical areas, adding new sections to Seattle Municipal Code Chapter 25.09, amending Section 3 of Ordinance 118466 which amended for 90 days Seattle Municipal Code section 23.76.355, and declaring an emergency.

 BE IT ORDAINED BY THE CITY OF SEATTLE AS FOLLOWS:

 Section 1. The City Council hereby makes the following legislative findings and declarations of fact:

 a. On January 13, 1997 the City Council declared an emergency and passed Ordinance 118466, which took effect immediately upon the Mayor's signature on January 15, 1997. Ordinance 118466 prohibited for ninety days certain development that was subject to the City's Regulations for Environmentally Critical Areas and proposed for landslide-prone areas as such areas are described in Seattle Municipal Code section 25.09.020.B.1.a.

 b. On March 10, 1997, the City Council passed Resolution 29545, adopting Findings and Declarations of Fact in Support of Ordinance 118466.

 c. On February 24, 1997, and March 4, 1997, the City Council conducted a public hearing, and on March 4, 1997 and March 18, 1997 City departments presented reports at meetings of the Business, Economic, and Community Development Committee. The testimony at the public hearing and the reports at the committee meetings focused both on the conditions that led the City to enact Ordinance 118466 and on the effectiveness of the City's existing Regulations for Environmentally Critical Areas at preventing damage to public and private property.

 d. The City Council now concludes from the information presented to it that there is no need to declare an emergency to enact substantive changes to the City's Regulations for Environmentally Critical Areas to take effect before the expiration of Ordinance 118466. The City will continue to monitor the effectiveness of its substantive Regulations as more information becomes available and as additional experience with the Regulations is obtained. The City also will continue to analyze the costs versus the benefits to the taxpayers of providing or repairing infrastructure improvements in landslide-prone areas to determine whether more of those costs should be borne by property owners who are benefited by such improvements.

 e. The City Council does conclude, however, that procedural changes to the City's Regulations for Environmentally Critical Areas must be effective before the expiration of Ordinance 118466 in order to help prevent mistakes and omissions on the part of applicants from leading to unsafe development, and to help prevent the unsafe development that could result when slides and other significant changes in landslide- prone areas occur after the City has reviewed an application or issued a permit.

 f. The City Council further concludes that the restrictions on development imposed in Section 3 of Ordinance 118466 should be modified in order to allow additional processing of permits to proceed before the expiration of Ordinance 118466.

 Section 2. A new Section is added to Seattle Municipal Code Chapter 25.09 as follows:

 25.09.345 Permit renewals in landslide-prone areas

 A. In addition to satisfying the provisions of SMC Chapter 23.76 and Section 106.9 of the Building Code, an applicant seeking to renew a building permit for new or additional development in a landslide- prone area, as described in SMC Section 25.09.020.B.1.a, must submit a Letter of Certification (LC) from the current project Engineer of Record stating that a geotechnical engineer has inspected the site and area surrounding the proposed development within the 60 days preceding submittal of the letter; and that

 1. In the project engineer's professional opinion no significant changes in conditions at the site or surrounding area have occurred that render invalid or out-of-date the analysis and recommendations contained in the technical reports and other application materials previously submitted to DCLU as part of the application for the permit being renewed; or that

 2. In the project engineer's professional opinion changes in conditions at the site or surrounding area have occurred that require revision to project criteria or the permit, and that in the project engineer's professional opinion all technical reports and any necessary revised drawings that account for the changed conditions have been submitted.

 The Director may renew a permit for development in a landslide-prone area if, after considering the information submitted in conformance with subsections 1. or 2. above, he or she determines that there is no increased risk of damage to the proposed development, to neighboring properties, or to the drainage basin. In making such a determination the Director may impose new conditions or require the submittal of revised plans, but the Director may renew a permit with different conditions or revised plans only if the project as revised is within the scope and intent of the original Master Use Permit.

 B. In the event a Letter of Certification as described in A. above is not submitted, the permit shall not be renewed.

 C. An applicant for renewal also must demonstrate that any required bond or insurance still is in effect, and that the amount of such bond or insurance still is appropriate. The Director may require a bond or insurance as a condition of renewal even if such bond or insurance was not required previously.

 D. From April 16, 1997 until December 31, 1998, or until such earlier time as the City Council by resolution shall inform the Director that the Council has concluded its review of the City's expenditures for infrastructure on unstable land, each applicant for renewal of a Master Use Permit or a building permit, for new development or for development that will expand the footprint of existing development, on each property located in whole or in part in a known landslide-prone area as defined in SMC Section 25.09.020.B.1.a.(1) or in an area that is both a steep slope as defined in SMC 25.09.020.B.1.a.(2)(b) and that exhibits soil characteristics identified in SMC 25.09.020.B.1.a(2)(a), shall be required to sign an acknowledgment that he or she has read the following notice:

 In view of the damage experienced in the landslides of 1996 and 1997, the City of Seattle has begun to review its policies on expenditures for infrastructure on unstable land. A range of options may be considered, including that (1) certain utility services provided by the City may not be provided under the same terms, conditions and rates that City utility services are provided in areas that are not landslide-prone, and that when the infrastructure for such utility services is paid for or built by applicants to serve their own properties, the City may not agree to repair, maintain, or own such infrastructure; and (2) any street, other than an arterial, that provides access to the proposed development and is damaged by landslides may not be repaired, rebuilt or repaved by the City, and if such street is repaired, rebuilt or repaved by the permit applicant, the City may not accept maintenance responsibility for such work. Any such changes in City policy will be adopted or approved by the City Council following a public process.

 Section 3. A new Section is added to Seattle Municipal Code Chapter 25.09 as follows:

 25.09.350 Processing applications in landslide prone areas

 Prior to issuance of a permit, the Director may require an applicant to submit a Letter of Certification as authorized by Section 25.09.345 and to satisfy the standards of that section. The Director's decision to require such a letter shall be based on such factors as the presence of known slides, indications of changed conditions at the site or the surrounding area, or other indications of unstable soils.

 Section 4. A new Section is added to Seattle Municipal Code Chapter 25.09 as follows:

 25.09.352 Issued permits in landslide-prone areas

 If the Director has reasonable grounds to believe that significant changes in conditions at a project site or in the surrounding area may have occurred since a building permit was issued, the Director may by letter or other reasonable means of notification suspend the permit until the applicant has submitted a Letter of Certification as authorized by section 25.09.345 and satisfied the standards of that section for permit renewal.

 Section 5. A new Section is added to Seattle Municipal Code Chapter 25.09 as follows:

 25.09.355 At the Director's discretion, permits for new or additional development in landslide-prone areas, as described in SMC Section 25.09.020.B.1.a, may be required to undergo third-party review as described in 25.09.080.C.

 A. In addition to the criteria in Section 25.09.080.C, the Director's decision to require third-party review shall be based upon, but shall not be limited to, such factors as whether there has been incomplete submittal of data or apparently inadequate design work, whether the project is large scale, or whether the development site is complex.

 B. The Director's discretion as exercised pursuant to this Section shall supersede the staged review process as described in 25.09.080.B.

 Section 6. A new Section is added to Seattle Municipal Code Chapter 25.09 as follows:

 25.09.356 From April 16, 1997 until December 31, 1998, or until such earlier time as the City Council by resolution shall inform the Director that the Council has concluded its review of the City's expenditures for infrastructure on unstable land, each applicant for a Master Use Permit or a building permit, for new development or for development that will expand the footprint of existing development, on each property located in whole or in part in a known landslide-prone area as defined in SMC Section 25.09.020.B.1.a.(1) or in an area that is both a steep slope as defined in SMC 25.09.020.B.1.a.(2)(b) and that exhibits soil characteristics identified in SMC 25.09.020.B.1.a(2)(a), shall be required to sign an acknowledgment that he or she has read the following notice:

 In view of the damage experienced in the landslides of 1996 and 1997, the City of Seattle has begun to review its policies on expenditures for infrastructure on unstable land. A range of options may be considered, including that (1) certain utility services provided by the City may not be provided under the same terms, conditions and rates that City utility services are provided in areas that are not landslide-prone, and that when the infrastructure for such utility services is paid for or built by applicants to serve their own properties, the City may not agree to repair, maintain, or own such infrastructure; and (2) any street, other than an arterial, that provides access to the proposed development and is damaged by landslides may not be repaired, rebuilt or repaved by the City, and if such street is repaired, rebuilt or repaved by the permit applicant, the City may not accept maintenance responsibility for such work. Any such changes in City policy will be adopted or approved by the City Council following a public process.

 Section 7. Section 3 of Ordinance 118466, which added new subsections D and E to Seattle Municipal Code Section 23.76.026 for ninety days or until a superseding ordinance was effective, whichever happened sooner, is amended as follows:

 D. Notwithstanding any other provision of this section or this chapter, no application for a permit for development that is subject to Chapter 25.09 and that is proposed for a landslide-prone area as described in Section 25.09.020.B.1.a, shall vest during the term of this ordinance unless the Director permits the work pursuant to Subsections A, B, or C, D, or E of Section 25.09.010.

 E. Notwithstanding any other provision of this section or this chapter, all development that is subject to Chapter 25.09 and that is proposed for a landslide-prone area as described in Section 25.09.020.B.1.a, shall have its vested rights suspended as follows during the term of this ordinance:

 1. No notice of the Director's decision on an application for a Master Use Permit shall be published unless the Director is satisfied that no significant changes in conditions at the site or surrounding area have occurred that render invalid or out-of-date the analysis and recommendations contained in the technical reports and other application materials previously submitted to DCLU as part of the application for the Master Use Permit;

 2. No building permit shall issue; and

 3. No approval of the foundation and site of a building or structure, as required by Section 108.5.2 of the Seattle Building Code, shall be granted.

 This suspension of vested rights shall not apply to the extent that development is permitted by the Director pursuant to Subsections A, B, or C, D, or E of Section 25.09.010.

 Section 8. Any acts made consistent with the authority and prior to the effective date of this ordinance are hereby ratified and confirmed.

 Section 9. The provisions of this ordinance are declared to be separate and severable. The invalidity of any clause, sentence, paragraph, subdivision, section or portion of this ordinance, or the invalidity of the application thereof to any person or circumstance, shall not affect the validity of the remainder of this ordinance, or the validity of its application to other persons or circumstances.

 Section 10. For the reasons cited in Section 1, the City Council finds that an emergency exists for which it is necessary for the preservation of the public health, safety, and welfare that this ordinance become effective without delay. The requirements of SMC Section 23.76.062 are hereby waived and suspended for the adoption of Section 5 of this ordinance. By reason of the facts stated in Section 1 and the emergency that is hereby declared to exist, this ordinance shall become effective immediately upon its approval by the Mayor or passage over his veto, as provided by the Charter of the City.
