Footnotes to Tables A and B:

A Grade V Boiler Fireman can also operate a low pressure boiler up to 5,000 kBtuh. A Grade V Boiler Fireman cannot operate steam boilers in battery  A Grade IV Boiler Fireman may operate a battery of not more than two steam or vapor boilers with a combined capacity no greater than 20,000 kBtuh total input; except when he/she is the head fireman on duty and under the direct (on site) supervision of a licensed steam engineer hereunder, he/she may operate a greater number of boilers, or boilers with greater capacity, for the purpose of training but not to exceed the capacity permitted by the license of such supervising engineer

 A Small Power Boiler Fireman license shall permit the licensee to operate no more than two small power boilers subject to the limitation in Table A.

 For license determination purposes, kBtuh or KW input ratings of a boiler shall be computed: as equal to burner input as rated and labeled by the burner manufacturer for gas, propane and similar burners. Where actual fuel flow during burner operation at the maximum firing rate can be reliably measured, the burner input may be computed by such method. as equal to the gallons-per-hour rating of the fuel nozzle or nozzles for oil burners as equal to the electrical input in KW as rated and labeled by the boiler manufacturer for electric boilers as the greater of all computed inputs in the case of multiple fuel burners as the cumulative input, as measured in a), b), c), or d) above, for boilers in battery (connected to a common header).

 A For boilers in battery so wired electrically such that only a single boiler can operate at a given time, the license requirement for such battery shall be determined by the most restrictive individual license requirement for any boiler in the battery.

 A Grade V Boiler Fireman can also operate an electric boiler less than 100 psi and 200 kw. A Grade V Boiler Fireman cannot operate steam boilers in battery A Grade III Steam Engineer can attend to Grade II Monitored boilers and a Grade II Steam Engineer can attend to Grade I boilers when such boilers are checked weekly by a Boiler Supervisor
