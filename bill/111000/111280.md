 AN ORDINANCE establishing separation incentive, retraining and severance pay programs for eligible nonrepresented City employees; and amending ordinances to accommodate program provisions.

 WHEREAS, the City expects significant revenue shortfalls beginning in 1997; and

 WHEREAS, reducing the number of funded positions in the City workforce before 1997 will mitigate the effects of the revenue shortfalls; and

 WHEREAS, the City desires to reduce the number of employees who may need to be laid off due to revenue shortfalls; and

 WHEREAS, separation incentives and retraining assistance may reduce the number of employees who must be laid off; Now Therefore,

 BE IT ORDAINED BY THE CITY OF SEATTLE AS FOLLOWS:

 Section 1. The Mayor and City Council authorize the Personnel Director to implement and promulgate guidelines related to an early separation incentive program, a retraining program and a safety net severance program as herein described for the nonrepresented employees of the City of Seattle, exclusive of elected officials, members appointed to City Boards and Commissions, department heads, and persons employed by the City of Seattle on a temporary or intermittent basis.

 Section 2. The provisions of this ordinance may be extended to employees represented by a union upon execution of a Memorandum of Understanding between the City of Seattle and the union certified to represent a bargaining unit of City employees.

 Section 3. Early Separation Incentive Program

 An Early Separation Incentive Program shall be established as follows:

 1) An employee is eligible to participate in the program if, as of April 30, 1996, he/she has completed one year (2,088 hours) of City employment in a regularly funded position and is employed in an eligible job category as determined by the appointing authority.

 2) Participation in the program by an eligible employee is voluntary. An employee may apply in writing or the City may make a written offer of an early separation incentive.

 3) An employee's early separation incentive pay shall be determined by multiplying one week's salary times years of service, not to exceed thirty thousand dollars ($30,000). The employee's current base salary for one week is their hourly rate for their regularly appointed position (not an out-of- class pay rate) for forty (40) hours, and the years of service shall be calculated by dividing the number of earned to date (ETD) hours in the City payroll system by 2,088, rounded to the nearest tenth of a year through the pay period ending date on or before the employee's separation date.

 The employee may select any of the following options, or any combination of the options, for distribution of the separation incentive pay:

 a. Lump sum cash payment, less all mandatory deductions.

 b. Payment of both the employee's and City's share of all costs necessary for up to four additional years of retirement service credit in the City of Seattle Retirement System.

 c. Payment of currently-enrolled health care benefits at the City's COBRA rate, subject to any rate changes, for maximum of eighteen (18) months.

 4) The City shall establish a one-time open window period for the filing of early separation requests for a minimum of forty-five (45) calendar days. An employee shall be required to sever City employment by no later than thirty (30) calendar days after the close of the open window period. This separation date may be extended at the discretion of the City, but in no event shall the date be later than December 31, 1996.

 5) In the event the City determines that within a given classification and department, more employees request to participate in the early separation incentive program than can be accommodated by that particular department, the City shall then accept such early separation requests in order of seniority, accepting the most senior as determined by classification seniority.

 6) Any employee who accepts the early separation incentive must agree to sever any and all rights to City employment and provide a release and hold harmless agreement in a form determined by the City, in favor of the City of Seattle. The severance, waiver, release and hold harmless are effective upon receipt and acceptance of the early separation incentive program. Employees who accept the early separation incentive shall not be hired for City employment for a period of two years. This prohibition shall cover full time, part time, Civil service exempt, and temporary positions, as well as consulting work. A participating employee must acknowledge the understanding that his/her rights to unemployment compensation benefits, if any, are governed by Chapter 50.20, RCW.

 7) The early separation incentive payment shall be excluded from "base salary" in the calculation of compensation for the purposes of retirement.

 8) All or a portion of the separation incentive payment may be subject to deferral under the deferred compensation plan. The combination of the employee's deferrals already made by payroll deduction in 1996 plus the amount deferred from the lump-sum payment may not exceed the $7,500 maximum.

 9) Approval of an early separation request is at the discretion of the City. The City reserves the right to deny requests for any reason.

 Section 4. Retraining Program

 The City shall establish a retraining program for employees targeted for layoff in the 1997 calendar year who are unable to transfer, bump, or have not yet been placed in other City employment through Project Hire. The Retraining Program shall operate under the terms and conditions as set forth below.

 1) An employee targeted for layoff will receive skills-based training to meet minimum qualifications for other City jobs, provided such employee meets each of the following eligibility criteria.

 The employee must:

 a. be a regular or probationary employee.

 b. agree to participate in skills assessment tests.

 c. possess skills and qualifications that would, in addition to skills-building provided by the retraining program, qualify him or her for a targeted job.

 2) The City will have discretion to flexibly design the retraining process to best meet individual needs.

 3) Costs shall not exceed $2,500 per employee.

 4) An employee must enroll for training during the period September 3, 1996, to December 31, 1996.

 5) An employee will remain in City employment while participating in the retraining program until the position is abrogated, or until the employee qualifies for and is formally placed in another position, whichever occurs first. If the position is abrogated prior to completion of the individual retraining program, the employee will be required to use paid leave time or be unpaid for the duration of the program.

 6) An employee's participation in this program does not guarantee City employment, future City employment, or a right to continue in the retraining program. There is no obligation for the City to create positions or otherwise formally set aside vacancies in order to assure placement.

 Section 5. Early Separation Incentive and Retraining Programs

 1) An employee may participate in either the Early Separation Incentive or Retraining Programs but may not participate in both.

 2) The Personnel Director will promulgate rules and procedures to implement the Early Separation Incentive and Retraining Programs consistent with this ordinance.

 Section 6. Safety Net Severance Program

 1) A regularly appointed full or part-time employee who is laid off from City employment during the period from the effective date of this ordinance through September 30, 1997, may select the Safety Net Severance Program. The benefit formula is as follows:

 Years of Service

 (Date of Last Hire) Severance Payment

 Up to one year $1,000

 One year, but less than three years $1,500

 Three years or more

 $2,500

 2) An employee who selects the Safety Net Severance Program shall sign the necessary agreement, waiver, and release forms similar to those of the Early Separation Program, except the exclusion from future City employment is limited to six (6) months.

 3) An employee who is offered and accepts temporary employment in lieu of layoff during the period from the effective date of this ordinance through September 30, 1997, shall be ineligible for the Safety Net Severance Program. Such employee shall not forfeit recall rights and will be eligible for subsequent temporary assignments.

 4) An employee who accepts the Early Separation Incentive Program is not eligible for this Safety Net Severance Program.

 Section 7. Temporary Employment Assignments Upon Layoff

 1) On a seniority basis, employees on a reinstatement list may be offered new temporary employment assignments within their departments within the same job classification from which laid off or a lower paid job title in the class series at the discretion of the appointing authority and to the extent budgeted funds are available.

 2) A laid off employee will be given strong consideration for temporary job openings within the same job classification from which laid off or a lower paid job title in the class series for openings in other City departments. Working as a temporary employee will not affect an employee's status on the reinstatement recall list.

 3) This Section 7 shall expire on October 31, 1997.

 Section 8. Ordinance 107790, Section 20 as last amended by Ordinance 118121 is further amended as follows:

 2. The Director may implement programs to refer laid-off employees to vacant City positions in any employing unit; provided, that each referred employee shall possess skills commensurate with the duties of the position to be filled, as determined by the Director, and provided, further, that no such referral shall result in a promotion for the affected employee unless the employee has been referred as a result of an appropriate qualifications audit. )).
