 EXHIBIT B

 CITY OF SEATTLE

 DUWAMISH BROWNFIELDS/TPH PROJECT

 SCOPE OF WORK

 Proposed Uses of Funds:

 The grants will be used to begin work on a new approach to evaluating risks and selecting cleanup remedies on industrial properties affected by Total Petroleum Hydrocarbon (TPH) contamination. This work will be divided in two parts: Part A - the basic technical components of risk analysis and remedy selection methodology, including computer modeling work to simplify the procedural requirements. Part B involves the development of detailed case studies.

 Part A:

 Funds will be used to begin the toxicological analysis part of the project -- contracting with consultants to critically review technical documents and begin computer modeling work necessary for the decision- tree logic that will be the basis of a new guidance methodology. This will focus on policy-related issues relevant to conducting human health and ecosystem risk analyses.

 Specifically, this type of risk analyses includes three major components:

 (1) Natural Resource Protection -- evaluation of fate and transport, leachability testing of TPH in soils and groundwater, and application of a tiered-approach to soil toxicity testing.

 .

 (2) Human Health Risk Assessment -- adaptation of national efforts regarding risk-based corrective action guidance, with emphasis placed on brownfields redevelopment.

 (3) Development of Risk Assessment Methodology and Guidance for TPH -- development of a guidance model that will be site-tested, with the goal of this being useful to individual industrial property owners and prospective purchasers, but with respect to area-wide conditions and multi-property strategies.

 Part B:

 Funds will also be used to hire consultants to determine the detailed scope of work for a case study, to formulate site selection criteria, and to assist the City of Seattle in completing the selection of an appropriate case study. The purpose of the case study is to examine how site-specific (e.g., groundwater to surface water exposure pathways) are folded into the application of the new evaluation and remedy selection methodology. This will ensure that the new guidance methodology is applicable specifically to Duwamish industrial properties.
