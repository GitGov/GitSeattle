 4.36.260 Optional lesser retirement allowances.

 A member may elect to receive, in lieu of the retirement allowance provided for in Section 4.36.210, its actuarial equivalent in the form of a lesser retirement allowance, payable in accordance with the terms and conditions of one (1) of the options set forth in options A through E of this section. Options F and/or G may be elected alone or in conjunction with one (1) of the options set forth in options A through E. The election of option F or G will result in the actuarial equivalent of the retirement allowance otherwise payable. Option G includes the lump sum payment of a partial refund. If a combination is elected, the lesser retirement allowance shall be determined by first applying the option G factor, if applicable, then the option F factor, if applicable, and then finally the option A-E factor. Upon the death of a retired member, any death benefits will be payable in accordance with the provisions of the options elected under this section if any. Election of any option must be made by written application filed with the Board of Administration at least thirty (30) days in advance of retirement as provided in Section 4.36.200, and shall not be effective unless approved by the Board prior to retirement of the member. The amount paid to a member, a beneficiary or a surviving spouse shall be reduced by payments made to an alternate payee under a court or department order as contemplated by Section 4.36.295.

 OPTION A. The lesser retirement allowance shall be payable to the member throughout his life; provided, that if he dies before he receives in annuity payments pursuant to Section 4.36.210A1 a total amount equal to the amount of his accumulated contributions as of the date of his retirement, the balance of such accumulated contributions shall be paid in one (1) lump sum to his estate or to such person as he shall nominate by written designation duly executed and filed with the Board.

 OPTION B. The less retirement allowance shall be payable to a member throughout his life provided that if he dies before he receives in annuity payments pursuant to Section 4.36.210A1 a total amount equal to the amount of his accumulated contributions as of the date of his retirement, the annuity payments resulting from his accumulated contributions shall be continued and paid to his estate or to such person as he shall nominate by written designation duly executed and filed with the Board, until the total amount of annuity payment shall equal the amount of his accumulated contributions as it was at the date of his retirement.

 OPTION C. The member shall elect a "guaranteed period" of any number of years. If he dies before the lesser retirement allowance has been paid to him for the number of years elected by him as the "guaranteed period," the lesser retirement allowance shall be continued to the end of the "guaranteed period," and during such continuation shall be paid to his estate or to such person as he shall nominate by written designation duly executed and filed with the Board.

 OPTION D. The lesser retirement allowance shall be payable to the member throughout life, and after the death of the member, one-half (1/2) of the lesser retirement allowance shall be continued throughout the life of and paid to the wife or husband of the member. If the spouse predeceases the member, then upon receipt of written notice of such death by the Board, the member's retirement allowance shall increase to the amount that would have been provided as if the member had not selected this option.

 OPTION E. The lesser retirement allowance shall be payable to the member throughout life, and after death of the member it shall be continued throughout the life of and paid to the wife or husband of the member. If the spouse predeceases the member, then upon receipt of written notice of such death by the Board, the member's retirement allowance shall increase to the amount that would have been provided as if the member had not selected this option.

OPTION F. A member who retires from service prior to the age of becoming eligible for retirement payments under the federal system, commonly known as Social Security, and who at the time of retiring is fully insured under the federal system, may elect to have his retirement allowance payable during his or her life only, increased prior to the age at which the member could elect an unreduced Social Security retirement benefit and reduced after such age by amounts which have equivalent actuarial values. Prior to retirement, the member shall obtain, and provide to the Board, a written estimate of his Old-Age Benefit for the age at which the member could elect an unreduced Social Security benefit. If option F is elected and the member's death occurs prior to the age at which the member could have elected an unreduced Social Security retirement benefit, any death benefit payable under any other option after the date the member would have attained such age, shall reflect the expected lesser amount of option F.

OPTION G. The member may elect to receive a lump sum payment upon retirement, of either fifty (50) percent or one-hundred (100) percent of his or her accumulated contributions. The member's retirement allowance as provided for in Section 4.36.210 shall be reduced by the actuarial equivalent of the withdrawn lump sum.

~~The amount paid to a member, a beneficiary or a surviving spouse shall be reduced by payments made to an alternate payee under a court or department order as contemplated by Section 4.36.295.~~
