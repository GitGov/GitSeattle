 2. A written reprimand, a copy of which must be placed in the employee's file;

 3. Suspension up to thirty (30) days;

 4. Demotion;

 5. Discharge.

 B. Which disciplinary action is taken depends upon the seriousness of the affected employee's conduct; except, in the absence of mitigating circumstances, a verbal warning or a written reprimand shall not be given for a major disciplinary offense.

 C. Suspension, demotion or discharge shall be approved by the employee's department head in writing. An hourly employee may be suspended up to one (1) day without the department head's approval for emergency situations, in accordance with rules promulgated by the Director. Suspensions of nonrepresented salaried employees shall be in increments of no less than one (1) week; provided, that when discipline is administered for major safety violations, suspensions of at least one (1) day but less than one (1) week may be approved.

 D. Disciplinary actions shall be reported by the department head to the Personnel Director for records purposes, and the Personnel Director's use in compiling guidelines for like treatment of like behavior from department to department.

 E. The Personnel Director may establish rules for application of discipline which are consistent for like behavior from department to department. A department may, by rule, be permitted to impose a more severe penalty than is otherwise sanctioned where misconduct which may be of minimal significance to other departments has a substantial impact on the operations, costs, or safety within that department.

 F. The following is a nonexclusive list of major disciplinary actions where a verbal warning or written reprimand will not be appropriate in the absence of mitigating circumstances:

 1. Assault or threat toward another person;

 2. Being impaired or affected by and/or testing positive for alcohol or a controlled substance during working hours or using or possessing alcohol or a controlled substance at the workplace;

 3. Use of City time, equipment or facilities for private gain or other non-City purpose;

 7. Carrying or otherwise possessing firearms or any type of weapon in the course of employment, except as authorized by the appointing authority;

 8. Unauthorized absence;

 9. Endangering the safety of, or causing injury to, the person or property of another through negligence or intentional failure to follow policies or procedures;

 10. Making a bribe, accepting a bribe, or soliciting a bribe;

 11. A knowing or intentional violation of the City Code of Ethics;

 12. Conviction of any felony or misdemeanor crime that is or may be work related, or may impair the employee's ability to perform his/her job duties, whether committed at or away from the worksite or during or outside working hours;

 13. Acts of racial/sexual harassment and/or acts of discrimination that are prohibited by federal, state, or local laws , or a failure to fulfill a responsibility to report incidents of harassment and/or discrimination to an appropriate City manager or Human Resources employee; or

 14. Other offenses of parallel gravity.

 G. Where an employee is accused of any action

 which, if proven, would be grounds for removal of that employee from his/her position of employment, the appointing authority may suspend the employee pending investigation of the matter. An employee who is suspended without pay and who is finally exonerated, shall be reinstated and awarded back pay and benefits.

 H. Conviction of a crime shall not disqualify a person from City employment, except where the conviction is for conduct reasonably related to the work the applicant would be performing for the City, and the conviction is less than five (5) years old.

 1. He or she has the right to appeal to the Civil Service Commission;

 2. To appeal, the employee must file a statement with the Civil Service Commission within twenty (20) days; and

 3.
