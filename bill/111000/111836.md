At the time a customer elects to take service under Schedule 44, the customer must chose whether to pay an Energy Charge as defined in Option 1 - DJ-COB or Option 2 - DJ Mid-Columbia. After choosing an Energy Charge Option, a customer may not chose a different Energy Charge Option for a period of one (1) year except that, should a new rate ordinance which changes Schedule 44 be adopted during this time, the customer may request a change in Energy Charge Option upon the effective date of the new ordinance or may request request return to a standard rate schedule upon the effective date of the new ordinance.
