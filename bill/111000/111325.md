 ATTACHMENT 2

 PUBLIC HEARING ON THE MAYOR'S PROPOSAL TO DECLARE CERTAIN PROPERTY SURPLUS TO THE CITY'S NEEDS

 The purpose of this public hearing is to receive comment on the Mayor's proposal to declare the following property to be no longer required for providing public utility service and to be surplus to the City's needs.

 The Northeast Quarter and the North half of the Southeast Quarter of Section 8, Township 26 North, Range 9 East, W.M., King County, containing an area of 240 acres, as acquired by the City of Seattle by quit claim deed and filed under King County Recording Number 5369777.

 In 1961, the City acquired this property, along with several other parcels in the vicinity, from the State of Washington. Through these and other land acquisitions, the City consolidated land ownerships in the Tolt River Basin in order to simplify road use and operating agreements covering both the South Fork, in which the City was then in the process of constructing a large water supply project, and the North Fork, where the City planned to develop an additional water supply source in the future.

 Although the North Fork Tolt continues to be listed in the City's long range water supply plans, other source options are presently more attractive and development of this source may not be needed for several decades, and even then only if potential adverse environmental impacts can be managed. The subject parcel, which is located some five miles upstream of a potential water supply intake structure, is surrounded by Weyerhaeuser ownerships. Under the present bilateral road and operating agreements, Weyerhaeuser is committed to implement the City's watershed protection policies, including access control and sanitation requirements, on its properties in the North Fork basin at such time as that source is developed. Conveyance of this parcel to Weyerhaeuser therefore does not, by itself, materially alter the City's position with respect to the North Fork source, nor does it materially increase the City's potential source protection obligations should such a project proceed.

 The forest on this parcel consists almost entirely of second growth hemlock that dates to 1951. Presumably, the original forest was harvested in the late 1940s. Topography, elevation, soils and other conditions classify this site as somewhat higher than average for commercial timber production.

 The City has a need to acquire from Weyerhaeuser a site for the planned Tolt Filtration Plant. The preferred site, as supported by technical studies and described in the project's Final Environmental Statement, would provide for the plant itself, plus future expansion, buffering from other land uses and activities, and on-site mitigation for environmental impacts. The Superintendent of Water has recommended and the Mayor has proposed that the City acquire the filtration plant site as part of an exchange for the parcel that is the subject of this declaration.
