 ORDINANCE __________________

 AN ORDINANCE adding a new section 4.20.380 to the Seattle Municipal Code, to adopt an Accountability Pay for Executives Program.

 WHEREAS the City is evaluating overall changes to its classification and compensation systems, with the intention of re-engineering those systems so that (1) job classifications include a wider range of duties, and classification series include avenues of advancement through skills expansion, performance excellence, and technical expertise, as appropriate; (2) the job measurement tools used to determine a position's appropriate classification and compensation are objective and understandable; (3) a link is established between the City's compensation package and those of the labor markets in which the City competes for employees; (4) compensation includes a performance pay component; and (5) employees are accorded the authority, accountability, and responsibility they require to complete their work, and their managers are accorded responsibility for implementing outcome-based performance evaluations; Now Therefore

 BE IT ORDAINED BY THE CITY OF SEATTLE AS FOLLOWS:

 Section 1. There is added to Seattle Municipal Code Chapter 4.20 a new Section numbered 4.20.380; as follows:

 Accountability Pay for Executives ProgramBase pay and incentives

 A. There is established an Accountability Pay for Executives Program (hereinafter referred to as the APEX Program) having base salary structure consisting of one (1) "executive pay band" with four (4) sub-bands, or "market groupings" . Upon the recommendation of the Personnel Director or his or her designated management representative and approval by the City Council, a position may be included in the APEX Program. Each position included in the APEX Program shall be exempt from the classified service pursuant to Article XVI Section 3 of the Carter of the City of Seattle and Seattle Municipal Code Chapter 4.13. Positions will initially be allocated by the Personnel Director to a market grouping on the executive pay band. The appointing authority shall have the discretion to set and/or modify base salary anywhere within the recommended market grouping for any such position under his or her direction. The appointing authority may also petition the Mayor for authorization to pay any APEX Program position under his or her direction in a market grouping other than that initially recommended by the Director, and the Mayor may accept, modify or decline such a petition. The APEX Program shall be implemented and administered substantially in accord with the APEX, Managers and Strategic Advisors Proposal, which is incorporated by this reference. Thereafter, the Personnel Director shall recommend to the City Council for approval adjustments to the market groupings based on a biennial labor market analysis of selected benchmark titles.

 The titles, pay band, and sub-bands ("market groupings") established for this Program are as follows:

 Title 1998 Market Grouping Title 1998 Market Grouping

 Executive 1 $27.23---$36.77 Executive 3 $38.05---$51.37

 Executive 2 $30.96---$41.80 Executive 4 $47.88---$64.64

 B. The Personnel Director will recommend measures of performance and establish performance recognition procedures for the APEX Program.

 Using these measures and procedures as guidelines, the appointing authority may award to an APEX Program executive a lump sum payment of up to ten percent (10%) of base salary, in addition to base salary, for recognition of the accomplishment of goals and work outcomes at the completion of an annual evaluation period. Any lump sum payment made pursuant to this subsection shall be considered a part of regular compensation, prorated annually, for purposes of withholding retirement contributions and determining retirement benefits for affected employees who are members of the City Employees Retirement System.

 C. The Personnel Director shall recommend, and the City Council may approve, subsequent allocations of positions into or out of the APEX Program.

 Section 2. It is the express intent of the City Council that, in the event another ordinance has heretofore been enacted that amended any section or subsection of the Seattle Municipal Code amended or recodified herein, that earlier amendment should be effectuated with equal dignity to this ordinance if at all possible in the codification of the Seattle Municipal Code and by the courts, notwithstanding the use in this ordinance of an obsolete version of that part of the Seattle Municipal Code on which to show intended amendments.

 Section 3. It is the express intent of the City Council that, in the event a subsequent ordinance refers to or amends a section or subsection of the Seattle Municipal Code amended or recodified herein, but the later ordinance fails to account for the change made by this ordinance, the two (2) sets of amendments should be given effect together if at all possible.

 Section 4. It is the express intent of the City Council that this ordinance makes only those changes to the Seattle Municipal Code shown by striking out, inside double parentheses, text to be deleted, and underlining text to be added. To this end, errors in showing the pre- existing Seattle Municipal Code text are to be disregarded, and no change in the Seattle Municipal Code is intended thereby.

 Section 5. The several provisions of this ordinance are declared to be separate and severable and the invalidity of any clause, sentence, paragraph, subdivision, section, or portion of this ordinance, or the invalidity of the application thereof to any person or circumstance, shall not effect the validity of the remainder of this ordinance or the validity of its application to other persons or circumstances.

 Section 6. Any acts made consistent with the authority and prior to the effective date of this ordinance are hereby ratified and confirmed.

 Section 7. This ordinance shall take effect and be in force thirty (30) days from and after its approval by the Mayor, but if not approved and returned by the Mayor within ten (10) days after presentation, it shall take effect as provided by Municipal Code Section 1.04.020.

 PASSED by the City Council of the City of Seattle this __________ day of _______________, 1997, and signed by me in open session in authentication of its passage this __________ day of ____________________, 1997. _____________________________________ President __________ of the City Council Approved by me this __________ day of ____________________, 1997. ____________________________________ Mayor Filed by me this __________ day of ____________________, 1997. _____________________________________ City Clerk (Seal)
