 EXHIBIT A

 DUWAMISH HYDROGEOLOGIC PATHWAYS PROJECT

 SCOPE OF WORK

 CITY OF SEATTLE

 DUWAMISH HYDROGEOLOGIC PATHWAYS PROJECT

 SCOPE OF WORK

 PROJECT DESCRIPTION

 The purpose of the Duwamish Coalition Hydrogeologic Pathways Project is to inventory, aggregate and analyze existing environmental cleanup and monitoring-well information pertaining to groundwater and sediment characteristics. Information to be examined includes pollutants, rate of flow, direction of flow, and historical land uses. This information will be compiled into a Geographic Information System (GIS) database and mapping coverage for use by local bodies, the U.S. EPA and the Department of Ecology, and the private sector. This information and GIS capability will be used to better identify points of risk and to better plan for protection and management of the groundwater resource in the 9,000-acre lower basin area of the Duwamish River watershed. This type of planning activity is essential to the successful implementation of growth management policies in King County and area-wide planning for more cost-effective environmental remediation in the Duwamish corridor.

 WORK PRODUCTS

 The work products are to consist of a variety of information databases, Geographic Information System (GIS) maps, and policy analyses as the consultant may propose to best achieve the project outcomes.

 SCOPE OF SERVICES

 A. Purpose:

 To promote and accomplish --

 1. Greater aggregation (in a single GIS) and availability/use of existing information regarding groundwater pathways, contamination, and historical land uses in order to:

 A. reduce some of the upfront costs of site investigations, in order that project funds might be more productively used for actual remedial actions and redevelopment/job creation; and

 B. promote area-wide regulatory decision-making.

 2. Greater numbers of site assessment, remediation and redevelopment/expansion of contaminated and either vacant or underutilized Duwamish industrial properties.

 B. Structure:

 1. The Hydrogeologic Pathways Project is funded jointly by the City of Seattle and King County, and managed in accordance with a Memorandum of Agreement signed by both jurisdictions.

 2. The consultant will work cooperatively with the City and County economic development offices (who will provide project management services), the City and County GIS divisions, and the University of Washington Center of Water Resources Management.

 3. The County and City GIS division will provide work related to ensuring database compatibility with the existing GIS, some level of data gathering or data entry (to be negotiated), custom mapping (or protocol development), and technical review of consultant work products related to GIS design. The City of Seattle's GIS will be the primary platform. The City's existing GIS is extensive, but does not include a subsurface layer or three-dimensional features describing hydrogeologic characteristics.

 4. The University of Washington Center of Water Resources Management will provide technical oversight related both to policy and GIS issues, some level of policy analysis related to watershed management issues, and some level of data gathering or database development (to be negotiated) in coordination/support of the City and County GIS divisions.

 5. The Department of Ecology has also assigned a team of individuals from the Northwest Regional Office (representing various divisions) to assist with this project. They will function as technical advisors to help ensure that the work products will be acceptable to and used by Department of Ecology Project Managers.

 C. Objectives:

 Develop a Geographic Information System (GIS) database and mapping capability to support area-wide planning, a complex array of land uses, and more efficient coordination of policies among the Department of Ecology and the local jurisdictions of the cities of Seattle and Tukwila, King County, and the Port of Seattle.

 Provide an information system and mapping capability for more easily charting the progress of cleanup efforts over time in a 14.2 square mile area of the Duwamish River watershed. The information database and mapping capability will be easily expanded as new well, soil, and sediments information becomes available, although some information (e.g., underlying sediment structure and geology) should have lasting value.

 Gain an area-wide understanding of groundwater flows and conditions in the shallow acquifers of the lower Duwamish River basin.

 Provide property owners and prospective buyers with information about known or potentially contaminated sites to spur effective (and predictable) redevelopment, business expansion, and clean-up efforts. Develop and display all information in an easily accessible, easily expandable format.
