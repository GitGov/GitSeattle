 WHEREAS, effective upon closing, the City assumed operation of said property, subject to the conditions expressed in Ordinance 118110; and

 WHEREAS, a subfund of the General Fund is the preferred method of controlling and tracking, in the Seattle Financial Management System, expenses and revenues associated with ownership of said property; and

 WHEREAS, said property has monthly operating costs, capital expenditures, tenant improvement costs, debt service and management expenses associated with it; Now, Therefore

 BE IT ORDAINED BY THE CITY OF SEATTLE AS FOLLOWS:

 Section 1. There is hereby established a subfund within the General Fund, entitled the Police Support Facility Subfund.

All expenses associated with said property, including but not limited to operations, property management, tenant improvements, capital improvements, leasing activity, and City management and planning for City occupancy, shall be paid from said subfund, either directly or through reimbursement of other City funds, subfunds, or accounts. The Director of Finance may establish such accounts and subaccounts as he or she deems appropriate from time to time for accounting purposes.

 Section 2. The expenditure allowance in the 1996 Budget for the Department of Administrative Services is hereby increased by the conditional appropriation of Seven Hundred Thirty Two Thousand and Five Hundred Twenty Four and No/Dollars ($732,524.00), or as much thereof as may be necessary, from unexpended and unencumbered balances in the Police Support Facility Subfund of the General Fund that have been derived from rents and other revenues attributable to said property. No part of this appropriation may be encumbered or expended except under the condition that there is sufficient unencumbered balance of such rents and revenues in the Police Support Facility Subfund at the time the encumbrance or expenditure is about to be made. This appropriation is solely for paying expenses associated with the 2203 Airport Way South. Any part of this appropriation remaining unexpended and unencumbered at the end of 1996 shall carry forward from year to year until fully expended.

 Section 3. The foregoing appropriation is made to meet actual necessary expenditures of the City for which insufficient appropriations have been made due to causes which could not reasonably have been foreseen at the time of the adoption of the 1996 Budget.

 Section 4. The Police Support Facility Subfund shall make periodic payments to the Bond Interest and Redemption Fund in amounts necessary to pay the principal and interest on all debt incurred by the City for acquisition of the property, as such payments become due.

 Section 5. The Director of Administrative Services is hereby authorized to execute contracts, leases or other such agreements necessary for operation and management of the property, consistent with the City's plan for ultimate occupancy.

 Section 6. The Administrative Services Fund (DASO) shall be reimbursed by the Police Support Facility Subfund for payroll and other expenses incurred after acquisition of said property associated with staff assigned to management of and planning for City occupancy of this facility, and for other necessary post-acquisition expenses incurred by DASO related to said property. The reimbursement amount for expenses shall be confirmed by the Director of Finance based upon documentation submitted by the Director of DAS, and shall be within the Police Support Facility Subfund appropriation authority.

 Section 7. Any act consistent with the authority and prior to the effective date of this ordinance is hereby ratified and confirmed.

 Section 8. This ordinance shall take effect and be in force thirty (30) days from and after its approval by the Mayor, but if not approved and returned by the Mayor within ten (10) days after presentation, it shall take effect as provided by Municipal Code Section 1.04.020.
