 AN ORDINANCE relating to financing for local improvement districts Nos. 6746 and 6747; establishing funds for them and providing for the issuance of installment notes payable from Districts Nos. 6746 and 6747 of the City and providing for the sale of those notes to the Cumulative Reserve Subfund, and amending ordinances 116824 and 116263 in connection therewith.

 WHEREAS, Local Improvement District #6746, 47th Avenue S.W. (slide repair; $39,000 in assessments), was created by Ordinance 116263 and confirmed by Ordinance 117190, and Local Improvement District #6747, South Dawson Street (asphalting and surface drainage; $128,676 in assessments), was created by Ordinance 116824 and confirmed by Ordinance 117921; and

 WHEREAS, Ordinances 116824 and 116263 provided only for issuance of local improvement district bonds or consolidated local improvement district bonds; and

 WHEREAS, a sufficient unexpended and unencumbered balance exists in the Cumulative Reserve Subfund, to invest in installment notes of the local improvement districts and said balance is surplus to the said Subfund for now and the foreseeable future; and

 WHEREAS, the City Council has determined that the use of installment notes, pursuant to RCW 35.45.150, is more cost effective than issuing Local Improvement District Bonds for long term financing of these two small Local Improvement Districts; and

 WHEREAS, the City Council has determined to issue installment notes and to sell those notes to the City's Cumulative Reserve Subfund; Now therefore,

 BE IT ORDAINED BY THE CITY OF SEATTLE AS FOLLOWS:

 Section 1. The Finance Director is authorized to establish Local Improvement District Fund #6746 and Local Improvement District Fund #6747 as separate subfunds of the Interfund Notes Payable - Local Improvement Districts Fund.

 Section 2. Effective May 1, 1996, pursuant to RCW 35.45.150, there shall be issued installment notes payable to the Cumulative Reserve Subfund of the General Fund out of the Local Improvement Fund, District No. 6746, to be dated May 1, 1996, and to become due on May 1, 2008. The City may provide, before May 1, 2008, alternative financing for this obligation. The Note for Local Improvement District No. 6746 will be issued for a principal amount of $39,000 representing the costs and expenses of the Local Improvement District No. 6746 which are to be borne by the property owners therein, including accrued interest. The note shall bear interest at the rate equal to 7.5% per annum, which is the rate currently paid by landowners participating in this local improvement district, to be paid annually on the unpaid balance of the note. This note shall be issued to the Cumulative Reserve Subfund of the General Fund. Money from this Local Improvement Fund shall be paid to the Cumulative Reserve Subfund of the General Fund at least once a year, beginning within one year from the date of issue, for the purpose of reducing the principal and interest amounts, including accrued interest at issuance, due on the installment note. Money from the local improvement fund received by the Cumulative Reserve Subfund of the General Fund first shall be applied toward interest due on the unpaid balance of the installment note and any additional money thereafter shall apply as a reduction of the principal amount of that note.

 Section 3. Effective May 1, 1996, pursuant to RCW 35.45.150, there shall be issued installment notes payable to the Cumulative Reserve Subfund of the General Fund out of the Local Improvement Fund, District No. 6747, to be dated May 1, 1996, and to become due on May 1, 2003. The City may provide, before May 1, 2003, alternative financing for this obligation. The Note for Local Improvement District No. 6747 will be issued for a principal amount of $128,676 representing the costs and expenses of Local Improvement District No. 6747 which are to be borne by the property owners therein, including accrued interest. The note shall bear interest at the rate equal to 5.5% per annum, which is the rate currently paid by landowners participating in this local improvement district, to be paid on the unpaid balance of the note. This note shall be issued to the Cumulative Reserve Subfund of the General Fund. Money from this Local Improvement Fund shall be paid to the Cumulative Reserve Subfund of the General Fund at least once a year, beginning within one year after the date of issue, for the purpose of reducing the principal and interest amounts, including accrued interest at issuance, due on the installment note. Money from the local improvement fund received by the Cumulative Reserve Subfund of the General Fund first shall be applied toward interest due on the unpaid balance of the installment note and any additional money thereafter shall apply as a reduction of the principal amount of that note.

 Section 4. The installment notes issued pursuant to this ordinance shall bear on their face (1) the name of the payee; (2) the designation of the local improvement district from whose funds the notes are payable; (3) the date of issue of the note; (4) the date on which each note or the final installment thereof shall become due; (5) the rate of interest to be paid on the unpaid balance of each note; and (6) the manual or facsimile signature as is required to appear on warrants of the City. The reverse side of the installment note shall bear a tabular payment record which shall indicate at prescribed installment dates the receipt of any local improvement district funds for the purpose of servicing the interest and principal indicated on each note. The tabular payment record, in addition to the above, shall show the unpaid balance due on each installment note together with sufficient space opposite each transaction affecting each note for the manual signature of the officer authorized to receive the money for the payee.

Such bonds or notes shall be in such form, contain such covenants, bear such date or dates, and shall be issued in such amounts and at such times or from time to time as the City Council may direct.

 Such bonds or notes shall be redeemed by the collection of special assessments to be levied upon the property within said district, payable in ten (10) equal annual installments, with interest, or in the alternative, in ten (10) equal annual installments of principal and interest, as the City Council may direct.

 The interest on the assessments shall be set equal to the true interest cost on the bonds or notes, calculated on the estimated maturities of the bonds or notes, rounded to the next highest tenth of one percent.

 In addition, in the event that an installment payment is delinquent, it shall, until paid, be subject to an additional charge of twenty percent (20%) levied upon the principal and interest due on such installment.
