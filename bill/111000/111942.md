 B. The Personnel Director shall recommend to the City Council for approval market adjustments to the pay zones based on a biennial labor market analysis of selected benchmark classifications from each occupational group.

 C. The Personnel Director will recommend to the City Council the assignment of each position within the Strategic Advisor category to a pay zone, and will establish criteria for subsequent allocation of positions to and withdrawal of positions from the Strategic Advisor Compensation Program.

 D. Each employee appointed to a position within the Strategic Advisor Compensation Program will be assigned a rate of pay within the pay zone by the appointing authority. If the rate of pay received by an incumbent immediately prior to assignment to the Strategic Advisor Program is higher than the upper limit of the pay zone recommended by the Personnel Director, or is higher than the rate established for the position by the appointing authority upon program implementation, the employee will retain an incumbency rate of pay until any biennial adjustments to the pay zone equal or exceed the incumbency rate; provided, the incumbency rating shall be maintained only as long as the duties assigned to the position are commensurate with the rate of pay.

 E. The Personnel Director will recommend measures of performance and establish performance recognition procedures for the Strategic Advisor Program. Using those measures and procedures as guidelines, the appointing authority may award to a Strategic Advisor Compensation Program participant a lump sum payment of up to eight percent (8%) of base salary, in addition to base salary, for recognition of the accomplishment of goals and work outcomes at the completion of an annual evaluation period. This lump sum payment shall be considered part of regular compensation, prorated annually, for purposes of withholding retirement contributions and determining retirement benefits for affected employees who are members of the City Employees Retirement System.

 F. For positions in the Strategic Advisor Compensation Program that are included in the City's classified service, the occupational group shall constitute the class series and the pay zone shall constitute the classification for all relevant provisions of the Seattle Municipal Code and Personnel Rules.

 Section 2. It is the express intent of the City Council that, in the event another ordinance has heretofore been enacted that amended any section or subsection of the Seattle Municipal Code amended or recodified herein, that earlier amendment should be effectuated with equal dignity to this ordinance if at all possible in the codification of the Seattle Municipal Code and by the courts, notwithstanding the use in this ordinance of an obsolete version of that part of the Seattle Municipal Code on which to show intended amendments.

 Section 3. It is the express intent of the City Council that, in the event a subsequent ordinance refers to or amends a section or subsection of the Seattle Municipal Code amended or recodified herein, but the later ordinance fails to account for the change made by this ordinance, the two sets of amendments should be given effect together if at all possible.

 Section 4. It is the express intent of the City Council that this ordinance makes only those changes to the Seattle Municipal Code shown by striking out, inside double parentheses, text to be deleted, and underlining text to be added. To this end, errors in showing the pre- existing Seattle Municipal Code are to be disregarded, and no change in the Seattle Municipal Code is intended thereby.

 Section 5. The several provisions of this ordinance are declared to be separate and severable and the invalidity of any clause, sentence, paragraph, subdivision, section, or portion of this ordinance, or the invalidity of the application thereof to any person or circumstance, shall not affect the validity of the remainder of this ordinance or the validity of its application to other persons or circumstances.

 Section 6. Any acts made consistent with the authority and prior to the effective date of this ordinance are hereby ratified and confirmed.

 Section 7. This ordinance shall take effect and be in force thirty (30) days from and after its passage and approval; but if not approved by the Mayor within ten (10) days of its presentation, it shall take effect in accordance with Municipal Code 1.04.020.
