 AN ORDINANCE placing before the voters a proposition to lift temporarily the limit on regular property tax levies; providing for the submission to the qualified electors of the City at a special election to be held therein on May 21, 1996, a proposition authorizing the City to levy regular property taxes for up to five (5) years in excess of the otherwise applicable 106% limitation on regular property tax levies for purposes of a Commons park, improvements within and near that park, and affordable housing in the South Lake Union area; providing for acquisition, relocation assistance, planning, design, engineering, construction, reconstruction, environmental assessment and remediation, utility relocation, financing, development, installation, equipping, repair and rehabilitation of and related to a Commons park, transportation and other improvements around the park, and preservation of affordable housing in the South Lake Union area; providing for the annual levy and collection of taxes; establishing a fund therefor; establishing certain administrative and financial procedures, including authorizing certain borrowings; and ratifying and confirming prior acts.

 BE IT ORDAINED BY THE CITY OF SEATTLE AS FOLLOWS:

 Section 1. Purpose. The purpose of this levy lid lift is to provide a portion of the funding for real property acquisition, park and related transportation improvements, and housing preservation in the South Lake Union area of Seattle.

 Section 2. Findings. The City Council makes the following findings:

 (a) Providing in whole or in part for real property acquisition and park improvements together with related transportation improvements and housing preservation related to the impact of park improvements, all in the South Lake Union area of Seattle, as described in the South Lake Union Project definition below, is a public and municipal purpose.

 (b) By providing an important park and recreation resource for the people of Seattle, encouraging housing opportunities for employees at all income levels, and improving the area's transportation infrastructure, development of the South Lake Union Project, as defined below, will

 provide incentives to retain many existing businesses and draw new businesses to the South Lake Union area, thus promoting economic development.

 (c) A need exists to begin acquisition of land for a Commons park as soon as possible, should the voters approve this measure, to minimize costs in a time of projected rising land values and that need constitutes an emergency under RCW chapter 29.13 requiring submission to the qualified electors of The City of Seattle of a proposition, pursuant to RCW 84.55.050, lifting the 106% "lid" on regular property tax levies for this purpose for five (5) years at a special election to be held on May 21, 1996.

 Section 3. Definitions. As used in this ordinance, the following words shall have these meanings:

 (a) "City" means The City of Seattle.

 (b) "City Legislative Authority" means the Mayor and the City Council.

 (c) "Levy" means the levy of regular property taxes for the purposes and under the conditions provided in this ordinance and authorized by the electorate pursuant to state law.

 (d) "Project" means the South Lake Union Project.

 (e) "South Lake Union Project" means the development, construction, reconstruction, installation, equipping, repair and/or rehabilitating of new or existing facilities, grounds, and improvements as described in the South Lake Union Project Description in Attachment 1 hereto and as such description may be modified from time to time as set forth in Section 5 below.

 (f) "Project Costs" means the costs of undertaking the Project, including but not limited to the costs of planning, oversight, administration, design, legal services, engineering and architectural services, other consultants, acquisition, financing, development, relocation assistance, construction, reconstruction, installation, repair, equipping and/or rehabilitation.

 Section 4. South Lake Union Project Description. The South Lake Union Project Description in Attachment 1 hereto is hereby approved. The South Lake Union Project Description may be modified only in accordance with Section 5 hereof.

 A maximum of Fifty Million Dollars ($50,000,000) for the South Lake Union Project will be provided by the principal proceeds of the Levy authorized herein. The remainder of the costs will be paid from other City funds, other public funds, private funding and contributions, and other money legally available to the City.

 Section 5. Modification of Project. The South Lake Union Project, as defined in Section 3 above, may be modified from time to time as the City Legislative Authority may by ordinance provide, consistent with the best interests of the City as determined by the Legislative Authority.

 Section 6. Levy submittal. The City hereby submits to the qualified electors of the City a proposition as authorized by RCW 84.55.050 to lift the one hundred six percent (106%) levy limitation on regular property taxes contained in RCW 84.55.010 for property taxes levied in 1996 through 2000 for collection in 1997 through 2001, respectively, for the sole purpose of raising a maximum of Fifty Million Dollars ($50,000,000) in aggregate within five (5) years, to provide for part of the cost of the Project. The proposition shall be limited so that the City shall not levy in any year more than Eighteen Million Dollars ($18,000,000) in excess of the maximum amount of regular property taxes that it could have levied consistent with RCW chapter 84.55 in the absence of this ordinance. If the maximum additional amount of Eighteen Million Dollars ($18,000,000) were collected in 1997, this would add approximately forty-one cents ($0.41) per One Thousand Dollars ($1,000) of assessed value to the dollar rate of regular property taxes. The levy rates for taxes levied in years 1996 through 2000 for collection the following years will vary to reflect changes in the municipal tax base and the City Legislative Authority's decisions as to what portion of the balance of the Levy remaining to be collected shall be levied in each year. Pursuant to RCW 84.55.050 (4), the maximum regular property taxes that may be levied in 2001 for collection in 2002 and in later years shall be computed as if property taxes had not been increased under this ordinance.

 Section 7. Application of Levy Proceeds. The proceeds of the Levy shall be deposited in the City Treasury into a special fund entitled the "South Lake Union Project Fund" (the "Fund") which is hereby created. Money in the Fund may be temporarily deposited or invested in such manner as may be lawful for the investment of City money and interest and other earnings shall be added thereto. The principal proceeds from the Levy and any interest or other earnings from their deposit or investment shall be applied for Project Costs.

 There may also be deposited in the Fund appropriations of the City and other money that may become available from time to time to pay Project Costs.

 If it appears that there will be more than sufficient funds in the South Lake Union Project Fund to accomplish the South Lake Union Project, the City Legislative Authority by ordinance may reallocate such additional moneys to enlargement or additions thereto or to other municipal purposes which it finds will further accomplish the intent of the South Lake Union Project.

 Section 8. Financing. To the extent permitted by applicable law the City may issue bonds, notes, or other evidences of indebtedness payable wholly or in part from the proceeds of the additional taxes authorized under this ordinance, and apply such tax proceeds to the payment of principal of, interest on, and premium (if any) on such bonds, notes, or other evidences of indebtedness and to the payment of costs associated with them. The dates, terms, conditions, interest rate or rates and other features of such financing or financings shall be determined by the City Legislative Authority. Any such ordinance may provide for authorization of actions by the Director of Finance or other authorized officers pursuant to RCW 39.50.030.

 Section 9. Election; Ballot Title. The King County Director of Records and Elections, as ex officio supervisor of elections, is hereby requested to find the existence of an emergency pursuant to RCW Chapter 29.13, as described in Section 2, and is requested to assume jurisdiction of and to call and conduct a special election and to submit to the qualified electors of the City the proposition set forth below.
