 BE IT ORDAINED BY THE CITY OF SEATTLE AS FOLLOWS:

 SECTION 1. Effective January 1, 1998, Seattle Municipal Code 22.504.010 (Section 6(a) of Ordinance 109033, as last amended by Section 1 of Ordinance 116939) is amended as follows:

 22.504.010 Permit fees. Every applicant for a permit to do work under this Plumbing Code shall pay for each permit, at the time of issuance, a fee in accordance with the following schedule, and at the rate provided for each classification shown in this schedule:

 Reduced pressure principle backflow prevention device and/or double check valve assembly - each~~8.00~~10.00

 B. Fees for Miscellaneous Inspection Services

 Fees for inspection service outside regular working hours or for inspection service requested but not covered by a permit will be charged for at a rate equal to the cost of performing the service.

 Fees for permanent location inspection of factory housing or modular unit containing plumbing - For each single- family dwelling or each modular unit containing plumbing ~~$18.00~~$20.00

 Plumbing permit includes on-site connections of building drain extensions, water service and necessary gas piping connections.

 Fees for reconnection and retest of plumbing systems in relocated buildings - For each building containing plumbing (( ~~18.00~~ 20.00

 Plumbing permit includes on-site connections of building drain extensions, water service and necessary gas piping connections

 Additional plumbing fixtures installed after relocation for each plumbing fixture or trap ~~8.00~~10.00

 C. For the purpose of this section "fixture" means and includes any appliance which is connected with a water, drain, or vent pipe, but no sillcock faucet or hose bibb shall be considered a fixture. A sanitary plumbing outlet on or to which a plumbing fixture or appliance may be set or attached shall be construed to be a fixture.

 D. Any person who commenced any work for which a permit is required by this Plumbing Code without first having obtained such permit, shall upon subsequent application for such permit pay double the fee fixed by the above schedule of fees for such work unless it shall be proved to the satisfaction of the Administrative Authority that such work was urgently necessary and that it was not practical to obtain a permit prior to the commencement of the work. In all such emergency cases, a permit shall be obtained as soon as it is practical to do so, and if there is an unreasonable delay in obtaining such permit, a double fee shall be charged as provided in this section.

 E. A reinspection fee of Forty Dollars ($40.00) may be assessed for each inspection or reinspection when such portion of work for which inspection is called is not complete or when corrections called for are not made. This subsection is not to be interpreted as requiring inspection fees the first time a job is rejected for failure to comply with the requirements of this Code, but as discouraging the practice of calling for inspection or reinspection.

 Reinspection fees may be assessed when the permit is not properly posted on the work site, the work to be inspected is not under test, for failure to provide access on the date for which inspection is requested, or for failure to make required corrections. To obtain a reinspection the applicant shall file an application therefor in writing upon a form furnished for that purpose, and pay the reinspection fee in accordance with this section. In instances where reinspection fees have been assessed, no additional inspection of the work will be performed until the required fees have been paid.

 SECTION 2. Effective date. This ordinance shall take effect and be in force beginning on the later of the following dates: (1) the date the amendments to King County Code section 16.32.080 governing plumbing fees as proposed in King County Council Proposed No. 97-621 in the form in which it existed on November 5, 1997, become effective, and (2)(a) if this ordinance is approved by the Mayor and returned within ten (10) days after presentation, thirty (30) days from and after the approval of this ordinance by the Mayor, or (b) if this ordinance is not approved and returned by the Mayor within ten (10) days after presentation, the date provided by Municipal Code Section 1.04.020 for its effectiveness.
