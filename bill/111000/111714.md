 A. As used in this section, the following words shall have the following meanings:

 "Eligible Project" means any housing development or redevelopment project in the City of Seattle that receives a HUD utility allowance, in which at least 50% of the dwelling units will be affordable to and will be occupied by households with aggregate annual incomes no higher than fifty percent (50%) of median income.

 "Median Income" means annual median income for the Seattle-Everett Metropolitan Statistical Area, adjusted for household size, as provided from time to time by the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development ("HUD"). If HUD ceases to provide such estimates no less frequently than annually, then "Median Income" shall mean such comparable figure for the Seattle area or an area including Seattle, published or reported by a federal, state, or local agency, as the City shall select in its sole discretion.

 "Public Infrastructure" means the water, wastewater and/or drainage infrastructure that is required to be (i) constructed or installed under SMC 21.04.060.B, SMC 21.16.270.B and/or SMC chapter 23.53, respectively, and any rules or policies that may be promulgated thereunder, and (ii) transferred to the City upon completion of construction.

 B. For housing development or redevelopment projects certified by the Department of Housing and Human Services as Eligible Projects and that are required to construct Public Infrastructure, Seattle Public Utilities shall fund the actual cost of the Public Infrastructure prorated according to the percentage of dwelling units that will serve households with aggregate annual incomes no higher than fifty percent (50%) of median income; provided that the property owner installs water and electric meters (or submeters, as applicable) in the Eligible Project and that all Public Infrastructure and all meter work is performed in a manner acceptable to Seattle Public Utilities. An amount equal to such funding shall be recovered through increased water, wastewater and drainage charges established by ordinance. The Department of Housing and Human Services shall certify only those projects that meet the criteria of Eligible Projects and that also demonstrate to the satisfaction of the Department that the property owner will comply with all applicable State law, including without limitation public bidding and prevailing wage laws, and with all applicable City law, including without limitation laws pertaining to the prevention of discrimination and women and minority business enterprises. The Department of Housing and Human Services, in agreement with Seattle Public Utilities, is hereby authorized to develop rules and procedures for certification of, and follow-up reporting by Eligible Projects to ensure that they satisfy the intent of this ordinance.
