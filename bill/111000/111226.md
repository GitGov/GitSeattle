 AN ORDINANCE related to women and minority business enterprises; amending SMC Sections 20.46A.090B.

 BE IT ORDAINED BY THE CITY OF SEATTLE AS FOLLOWS:

 Section 1. SMC Section 20.46A.090B is amended as follows:

 B. In addition to such other requirements as may be set forth elsewhere, the following shall apply to all contracts entered into by the City and to all contracts where funds are administered or provided by the City through grants, loans, or other forms of financing:

 1. Bid conditions, requests for proposals, and all other specifications shall require the bidder or proposer to make affirmative efforts to subcontract to or to purchase from WMBEs, and to commit to meeting the WBE and MBE set-asides, if any, established for the project. Requests for proposals for projects on which WMBE set-asides have been waived under SMC Section 20.46A.150 shall require proposers to document the efforts made to contact WMBEs in developing the proposal.

 2. When set-asides greater than zero are established for a contract, the c~~C~~ontract~~s~~ shall include the following provision:

 This contract hereby incorporates by reference Seattle Municipal Code (SMC) Ch. 20.46A. The failure of the contractor or any subcontractor to comply with any of the requirements of SMC Ch. 20.46A shall be a material breach of contract. The purpose of Seattle's WMBE Program is to provide a prompt remedy for the effects of past discrimination. The City in general, and this Program in particular, are damaged when a contract, or portion of a contract, to be performed by a WBE or MBE is not actually performed by a WBE or MBE in compliance with SMC Ch. 20.46A. Because the actual amount of such damage is not reasonably calculable, the parties agree and stipulate that liquidated damages equal to the unmet dollar amount of any WBE or MBE set-aside will fairly compensate the City for resulting delays in carrying out the purpose of the program, the costs of meeting utilization targets through additional contracts, the administrative costs of investigation and enforcement, and other damages and costs caused by the violation.

 3. Contracts, other than leases, shall require that during the term of the contract, the contractor shall:

 a. Meet the WBE and MBE set-asides established for the contract, if any;

 b. Make affirmative efforts to utilize WMBEs in performing the contract, whether as subcontractors, suppliers, or in any other capacity;

 c. Require that all subcontractors make affirmative efforts to utilize WMBEs in performance of the contract;

 d. Maintain records reasonably necessary for monitoring compliance with the provisions of this chapter, and submit such information as may be requested by the Director in order to monitor and enforce compliance; and

 e. Require that subcontractors maintain records reasonably necessary for monitoring the subcontractors' compliance with the provisions of this chapter, and that the subcontractors submit such information as may be requested by the Director in order to monitor and enforce compliance.

 4. No contract shall be awarded to any person or business that is disqualified from doing business with the City under the provisions of this chapter or of SMC Chapter 20.44 or 20.46, as now or hereafter amended. No contractor shall subcontract to, or purchase supplies, materials, or services from, any person or business which is disqualified from doing business with the City under the provisions of this chapter or of SMC Chapter 20.44 or 20.46, as now or hereafter amended.

5. The Director may exempt contracts, including leases of City-owned facilities, from any or all of the requirements of this subsection B if it would not impair the purposes of the WMBE program.

 Section 2. Any acts done consistent with and prior to the effective date of this ordinance are hereby ratified and confirmed.

 Section 3. This ordinance shall take effect and be in force thirty (30) days from and after its approval by the Mayor, but if not approved and returned by the Mayor within ten (10) days after presentation, it shall take effect as provided by Municipal Code Section 1.04.020.

 Passed by the City Council the _____ day of ____________, 1996, and signed by me in open session in authentication of its passage this _____ day of _________________, 1996.
