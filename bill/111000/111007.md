 Section 1. The assessment and assessment roll of Local Improvement District No. 6747 for the improvement of South Dawson Street from East Marginal Way South to 1st Avenue South, by asphaltic paving, etc., under Ordinance 116824, is hereby approved and confirmed in the total sum of One Hundred Twenty- Eight Thousand Six Hundred Seventy-Six and 09/100ths Dollars ($128,676.09).

 Section 2. That each of the lots, tracts, parcels of land and other property shown upon said roll is hereby declared to be specially benefited by said improvement in at least the amount charged against the same and that the assessment appearing against the same is in proportion to the several assessments appearing upon said roll. There is hereby levied and assessed against each such lot, tract, parcel of land and other property appearing upon said roll the amount finally charged against the same thereon.

 Section 3. That for the purpose of this improvement, there is hereby created and established a special fund to be called "Local Improvement Fund, District No. 6747."

 Section 4. It is estimated that the local improvement bonds issued in payment of the cost and expense of this local improvement shall bear interest at the rate of five and one-half percent (5.5%) per annum. Interest on the whole amount unpaid after the thirty day period allowed for payment of assessments without penalty or interest shall be fixed pursuant to the ordinance authorizing the issuance and sale of the bonds.

 Section 5. The sum charged against any lot, tract and parcel of land or other property, or any portion thereof, may be paid during the thirty day period allowed for payment of assessments without penalty or interest. In the event that thereafter the effective interest charge has not been determined at the time payment of an assessment is tendered, the Director of the Department of Finance is authorized to assume an interest rate based on the estimated local improvement district bond rate if bonds were sold at that time, compute the sum due as if that rate applied, and deposit the amount collected in the local improvement district fund.

 Section 6. This ordinance shall take effect and be in force from and after its approval by the Mayor, but if not approved by the Mayor within ten (10) days after presentation, it shall take effect as provided by Municipal Code Section 1.04.020.
