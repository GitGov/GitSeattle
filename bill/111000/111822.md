 ORDINANCE __________________

 AN ORDINANCE revising Seattle Municipal Code Section 4.34.055, Use and scheduling of vacations, to delegate approval of vacation accrual extensions from the Personnel Director to the appointing authority.

 WHEREAS Seattle Municipal Code Section 4.34.055, Use and scheduling of vacation, provides that the Personnel Director may approve a request to allow an employee to exceed his or her maximum vacation allowance when his or her vacation time off has been canceled for work-related reasons; and

 WHEREAS the circumstances surrounding both the cancellation of an employee's scheduled vacation and his or her inability to use vacation on an alternative schedule in order to avoid exceeding the maximum allowance are particular to the employing unit, putting the appointing authority in a better position to make such judgments; Now Therefore:

 BE IT ORDAINED BY THE CITY OF SEATTLE AS FOLLOWS:

 Section 1. Seattle Municipal Code Section 4.34.055, Ordinance 111757 as last amended by Ordinance 118265, is further amended as follows:

 A. The minimum vacation allowance to be used by an employee shall be no more than one half (1/2) day or, at the discretion of the appointing authority or his or her designated management representative , such lesser amount as may be ~~((approved by the department head))~~deemed appropriate, but no less than fifteen (15) minutes.

 B. The appointing authority shall arrange vacation time for employees on such schedules as shall least interfere with the functions of the employing unit.

 C. 1. An employee may, with the prior approval of the appointing authority or his or her designated management representative, go on unpaid leave of absence for a period of no more than twelve (12) months, without first using accrued vacation or compensatory time off.

 The appointing authority or his or her designated management representative may deny the use of vacation to an employee who has exhausted his or her sick leave balance and requests further paid leave for medical reasons.

 2. However, if an employee has City-provided long-term disability benefits and has accumulated a vacation, compensatory time, or sick leave balance in excess of that necessary to cover the long-term disability plan elimination period, he/she can choose either to receive the long-term disability benefits after the elimination period or to remain on vacation, compensatory time, or sick leave (with approval of the appointing authority or his or her designated management representative) until all such paid leave is exhausted and receive the appropriate long-term disability benefit.

 D. In the event that the City cancels an employee's already scheduled and approved vacation, leaving no time to reschedule such vacation before the employee's maximum vacation balance will be reached, the ~~((head of any employing unit may request the Personnel Director to))~~appointing authority or his or her designated management representative may allow ~~((an))~~the employee to exceed the normal maximum vacation balance and to continue to accrue vacation credit above the normal maximum credit balance for three (3) months after such maximum has been reached. ~~((Any such request must contain an explanation of the circumstances and reasons leading to the need for such allowance. When the explanation submitted documents circumstances and reasons consistent with the conditions specified herein, the Personnel Director shall authorize such an exception being made; otherwise, the Personnel Director shall deny the request.))~~No similar exception shall be authorized for such employee until twelve months after the ~~((Personnel Director's))~~ appointing authority's authorization.

 Section 2. This ordinance shall take effect and be in force thirty (30) days from and after its approval by the Mayor, but if not approved and returned by the Mayor within ten (10) days after presentation, it shall take effect as provided by Municipal Code Section 1.04.020.
