 AN ORDINANCE relating to the sale of land for housing development in the I-90 Redevelopment Project area; conditionally authorizing the sale of approximately 1.51 acres of surplus federal land being acquired by the City at 1701 Martin Luther King Jr. Way S., to be developed for home ownership; appropriating funds for purchase of the land and costs of disposition; and ratifying and confirming prior acts, all by a three-fourths vote of the City Council.

 WHEREAS, certain land owned by the United States, located in the County of King, State of Washington, commonly referred to as I-90 Parcel 44 and more particularly described on Exhibit A attached hereto ("the Parcel"), has been declared surplus and is subject to disposal to public entities by negotiated sale under federal law; and

 WHEREAS, The City of Seattle desires to promote affordable home ownership in the I-90 area, consistent with the I-90 Area Development Policies adopted 1989 by Resolution 27901 and updated by Resolution 29258, the City's Comprehensive Plan, and the City's Consolidated Plan;

 WHEREAS, HomeSight is a nonprofit community development corporation engaged in development of affordable housing for home ownership in the Central Area and Southeast Seattle and has received a grant from the federal government for such purpose under the Nehemiah Housing Opportunity Program; and

 WHEREAS, the Memorandum of Understanding between the City and HomeSight authorized by Resolution 28498 contemplates the sale of I-90 Parcel 44 to HomeSight if the City should be successful in acquiring it; and

 WHEREAS, by Ordinance 118353, the City Council authorized an offer to purchase the Parcel ("Offer") from the United States, which Offer has been submitted, and appropriated funds for the purchase; NOW, THEREFORE,

 BE IT ORDAINED BY THE CITY OF SEATTLE AS FOLLOWS:

 Section 1. The City Council finds that the redevelopment of the Parcel for home ownership will fulfill important public purposes of the City, and that the resale of the Parcel to HomeSight is necessary in order to ensure that such redevelopment occurs promptly and provides housing ownership opportunities, including ownership opportunities for lower income families, consistent with the plans, policies, and Memorandum of Understanding cited above.

 Section 2. The Mayor or Director of the Department of Housing and Human Services ("Director") is hereby authorized, for and on behalf of the City, to enter in to a Conditional Contract for Sale of Land ("Contract") with HomeSight by which the Parcel will be sold to HomeSight for development if the City's Offer to buy the Parcel is accepted. The sale price to Homesight shall be FOUR HUNDRED THIRTY THOUSAND DOLLARS ($430,000), subject to reduction under the Contract to the extent that HomeSight's commitment to develop and sell a portion of the Parcel to low- and moderate-income home buyers reduces the fair value thereof, but in any event not less than THREE HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS ($300,000). The Contract shall be on the terms set forth in the form attached hereto as Exhibit B and incorporated by this reference, with such modifications as the Mayor or Director shall deem necessary or appropriate to implement the intent of this Ordinance. The Mayor or Director is further authorized to execute and acknowledge, for and on behalf of the City, a Quit Claim Deed to the Parcel substantially in the form attached to this Ordinance as Exhibit C ("Deed") and, if the Offer is accepted and the Parcel is conveyed to the City, then to deliver and record the Deed upon satisfaction by HomeSight of the conditions in the Contract, and to take such further actions as shall be necessary or appropriate to implement, perform and enforce the Contract, including without limitation giving consents or approvals and issuing certificates of completion.

 Section 3. To the extent that the City or its escrow agent shall receive funds in payment of a portion of the sale price under the Contract on or prior to the date the City is to pay the United States for the purchase of the Parcel, such funds are hereby appropriated, in the amount of up to FOUR HUNDRED THIRTY THOUSAND AND NO/100 DOLLARS ($430,000.00), for the purpose of payment to the United States of all or a portion of the purchase price of $430,000 set forth in the Offer authorized by Ordinance 118353. The Mayor or Director is authorized to direct the disbursement of such funds on behalf of the City by a qualified escrow agent receiving the same, in which case documentation of such receipt and disbursement shall be promptly transmitted to the Department of Finance. It is the intent of this Section that if funds from HomeSight are available at closing, then funds appropriated under Ordinance 118353 shall be used to pay only that part of the purchase price allocable to those portions of the Parcel that HomeSight shall commit to develop for sale to low- and moderate-income home buyers in compliance with applicable federal Community Development Block Grant regulations. To the extent that such funds received by the City on or prior to the date the City is to pay the United States for the purchase of the property exceed THREE HUNDRED EIGHTY-SEVEN THOUSAND DOLLARS AND NO CENTS ($387,000.00), the Director is authorized to reimburse the Housing and Community Development Revenue Sharing Fund, from such funds or from funds received from the United States as a return of the earnest money paid by the City as part of the Offer, all or a portion of the FORTY-THREE THOUSAND DOLLARS ($43,000.00) appropriated and paid as earnest money to the United States as part of the Offer.

 Section 4. To the extent that funds appropriated in Ordinance 118353 are not required for the purchase of the Parcel and payment of related costs, such appropriation is abandoned. There is hereby appropriated from the Housing and Community Development Revenue Sharing Fund, Urban Renewal Closeout Subaccount, up to TWENTY THOUSAND AND NO/100 DOLLARS ($20,0000.00) of funds previously appropriated for acquisition of the Parcel by Ordinance 118353 and not needed for such purposes, for the purpose of paying costs of disposition of the Parcel, including but not limited to appraisal fees, title insurance, escrow fees, recording fees, and other costs to close, to the extent such items are determined by the Director to be eligible costs under rules applicable to the Community Development Block Grant Program. There is further appropriated from the Low Income Housing Fund, Downtown Housing Maintenance Account, I-90 Project, the amount of up to FIVE THOUSAND AND NO/100 DOLLARS ($5,000.00) for the purpose of paying any miscellaneous costs of disposition that may not be eligible for payment from the Housing and Community Development Revenue Sharing Fund under federal regulations. The Finance Department is authorized to pay the necessary warrants and make the necessary transfers.

 Section 5. The Director is authorized, for and on behalf of the City, to allow Homesight to defer payment of a portion of the sale price of the Parcel not exceeding that portion of the City's purchase price that is paid with funds from the Housing and Community Development Revenue Sharing Fund. The Director is authorized, at the time of conveyance of the Parcel to Homesight, to accept a Promissory Note and Deed of Trust on the Parcel, in the forms attached as Exhibits D and E with such modifications as the Director shall deem necessary or appropriate to implement the intent of this Ordinance; to release property from the lien of the Deed of Trust on the terms set forth therein; and to subordinate the Deed of Trust as may be necessary to facilitate the financing of housing development.

 Section 6. The Director shall deposit the deferred payments made by Homesight in accordance with the terms of the promissory note authorized in Section 5, into the Housing and Community Development Revenue Sharing Fund as reimbursement of amounts appropriated and paid from such fund pursuant to Ordinance 118353.

 Section 7. Any act pursuant to the authority and prior to the effective date of this ordinance is hereby ratified and confirmed.

 Section 8. The foregoing appropriations are made to meet actual necessary expenditures of the City for which no appropriations have been made due to causes which could not reasonably have been foreseen at the time of the adoption of the 1997 Budget; Now, therefore, in accordance with RCW 35.32A.060, by reason of the facts above stated, this ordinance shall take effect and be in force thirty days after its passage and approval, if approved by the Mayor; but if not approved and returned by the Mayor within ten (10) days after presentation, it shall take effect as provided by Municipal Code Section 1.04.020.
