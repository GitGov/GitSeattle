 1. Assignment of motor vehicles for a period of approximately one (1) year, ~~((corresponding to the annual budget period, or assignment for other specified periods of time,))~~and until a superseding assignment resolution is adopted, ,to City officials and employees who because of the nature of their work should have vehicles assigned to them, and authorization to garage such vehicles at the individual residences of the employees to whom assigned, shall be ~~((by the Executive Services Director (called the "Director" in this section),))~~ pursuant to resolution of the City Council.

 2. As soon as practicable after the end of each calendar year, the Executive Services~~((The))~~ Director (called the "Director" in this section) shall submit~~((on or before the fifteenth day of December of each year))~~to the City Council a list of the officials and employees to whom a vehicle should be assigned for the next succeeding~~((annual budget period))~~ year in accordance with the following criteria:

 a. The relative cost of having an employee provide his or her own transportation (whether in automobile reimbursement or lost productive time ~~((man hours))~~ is greater than the cost associated with overnight vehicle use; or

 b. Employees who, on a continuous basis, have primary supervisory responsibility (first called out) in case of an emergency and whose immediate response is required to save life or property, including employees and officials who have responsibilities of implementing the City's disaster plan; or

 Employees who, on a continuous basis, are on call in case of an emergency and who require special tools and equipment carried in their assigned vehicles in order to perform their emergency duties.

Assignments of motor vehicles for periods not to exceed thirty (30) days, and authorization to garage such vehicles at the individual residences of the employees to whom assigned, may be made by each employee's appointing authority, or by his or her designee, when the need for such an assignment is consistent with the criteria established by this section.

~~((3. Except as provided in subsection D of this section, such assigned vehicles shall be used in the conduct of municipal business only, and when authorized in such assignment may be garaged during nonworking hours at the residence of the individual to whom assigned.~~4. When an assigned vehicle is not needed or likely to be used, the officer or employee assigned the vehicle shall make it available for other departmental uses. If the assigned vehicle is not needed for other departmental uses, it shall be offered to the Director for use on a pool basis. The officer or employee may recall the assigned vehicle at any time in case of need.))

 C. Shared Use of City~~((Pool))~~ Vehicles. All City- owned or leased motor~~((other such))~~ vehicles shall be available on a shared ~~((pool))~~ basis for the conduct of municipal business to officers and employees who have a valid Washington State driver's license, under such rules and regulations as the Director may prescribe.

 D. Private Use Prohibited. Nothing herein shall imply, nor shall any permission be granted to use any City owned or leased motor vehicle for personal purposes, and the transportation of passengers in any such vehicle is prohibited except in the furtherance of municipal business, provided that City employees may ride directly to and from workin an assigned vehicle when the person to whom the vehicle is assigned and the riding employees are registered with Seattle Transportation ((Department)) as a carpool.
