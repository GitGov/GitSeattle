Regarding Seattle Center Facility Use," under which, among other changes, a reduction is made in the fee for such Licensee's use of the KeyArena, a reduction is made in the number of Home Game paid admissions that must be achieved by Licensee before such Licensee becomes entitled to a share in gross concession revenue, and the City share of revenue from any Club Seat program of Licensee is eliminated, all retroactive to the commencement date of such Agreement, in recognition of the common misunderstanding at the time such Agreement was originally negotiated, of the number of seats in the KeyArena that would be available for the viewing of hockey games.

 Section 3. This ordinance shall take effect and be in force thirty (30) days from and after its approval by the Mayor, but if not approved and returned by the Mayor within ten (10) days after presentation, it shall take effect as provided by Municipal Code Section 1.04.020.
