 MEMORANDUM OF UNDERSTANDING by and between THE CITY OF SEATTLE and SEATTLE PARKING ENFORCEMENT OFFICERS' ASSOCIATION

 This Memorandum of Understanding reflects the understanding of the City of Seattle, hereinafter "City," and the Seattle Parking Enforcement Officers' Association, hereinafter "Association," regarding the calculation and payment of a lump sum to Parking Enforcement Officers, hereinafter "PEOs," represented by the Association:

 1. As part of the contract settlement between the parties, PEOs will be entitled to receive payment of a lump sum. The lump sum will be calculated based upon the total hours of work from December 28, 1994 through November 12,1996. This total number of hours will be multiplied by an amount determined by an increase to PEO pay of 3.5% on December 28, 1994, and 2.9% on December 27, 1995. PEO pay will be determined by a weighted average of the step placement of PEOs, as of February 6, 1996.

 2. The lump sum payment will be increased based upon the total overtime hours worked by employees within the bargaining unit from December 28, 1994 through August 20, 1996, plus an additional 2157 hours of overtime based upon the overtime hours anticipated for the period of August 21, 1996 through November 12, 1996. The latter is the same number of overtime hours as was worked in the same period in 1995.

 3. Three employees who were hired after December 31, 1994, two employees who retired since December 31, 1994, and one employee who was accommodated in another position within the Police Department will receive a proportionate share of the lump sum payment based upon the length of their service during the period December 28, 1994 through November 12, 1996. All other PEOs who were employed on or before December 28, 1994, and who are currently employed as PEOs as of September 1, 1996, will receive a uniform lump sum of $2,920.

 Signed this day of , 1996.
