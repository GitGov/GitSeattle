 AN ORDINANCE relating to the personnel system, amending Seattle Municipal Code Section 4.04.220 to clarify employee "bumping" and reinstatement rights where layoff is based upon budget titles; to repeal provisions for layoff from grant funded positions and separate orders of layoff for part-time and full-time employee; and,

 WHEREAS, the Personnel Ordinance specifies the normal order of layoff of employees from positions with different budget and class titles or with budget titles only, but does not specify employee "bumping" and reistatement rights following such layoff; and,

 WHEREAS, the City no longer supports a substantial workforce funded by categorical grant sources; and

 WHEREAS, the distinction between part-time and full-time employees is unnecessary and not consistent between represented and nonrepresented employees, and therefore difficult to administer when both represented and nonrepresented employees in the same job class occur within the same department; Now, Therefore,

 BE IT ORDAINED BY THE CITY OF SEATTLE AS FOLLOWS:

 Section 1. Seattle Municipal Code Section 4.04.220, Ordinance 107790 (as last amended by Ordinance 117360 10, 1994), is further amended as follows:

 4.04.220 Layoff

 A. Order of Layoff. Within an employing unit, the order for layoff in a given class shall be as follows:

 1. Probationary employees

 2. Regular employees

 Provided, that temporary workers and interim employees shall be separated prior to the layoff of any probationary employee in the same employing unit and class.

 Among regular employees, order of layoff shall be in order of seniority until a performance evaluation system as contemplated by this chapter is in effect. Thereafter, the regular employee having the lowest performance evaluation in the class shall be laid off first, but among employees whose performance is substantially the same, layoff shall be in the order of seniority.

 In the event one (1) or more positions having different budget and class titles or having budget titles only and no class titles are scheduled to be abrogated for any reason and such abrogation will result in a layoff, the Director shall establish an order of layoff for regular employees that reflects their relative seniority in positions with the same budget title as such positions affected by the layoff.

 Separate orders of layoff shall be prepared for employees holding full-time and part-time positions in the event both types of positions occur in the class affected by a layoff.

 B. Exceptions to Normal Order of Layoff.

 1. Upon a showing by the appointing authority that the operating needs of an employing unit require such action, the Director may authorize an exception to the normal order of layoff and the retention in active employment of any employee who has some special experience, training or skill which is exceptional to the knowledges, skills and abilities expected of the population of employees for the positions affected by the layoff. Such exceptions to the normal order of layoff may be based upon documented recruiting and/or hiring specifications, current job descriptions or similar documentation acceptable to the Director.

 2. The Director shall modify the normal order of layoff in the smallest respect sufficient to prevent a negative disparate impact upon women, the disabled, or minorities when these conditions are present:

 a. Five (5) or more employees in an Equal Employment Opportunity job category are to be laid off at one time in an employing unit;

 b. The Director determines that women, the disabled, or minorities are substantially under represented in the EEO category affected by the layoff, or that any such protected group would become substantially under represented in the EEO category as a result of a layoff in the normal order; and,

 c. A layoff in the normal order should have a negative disparate impact on any such protected group; provided, that no such modification shall affect a regular employee unless all probationary employees in the affected class or assignment level have been laid off.

 d. For purposes of this permitted modification of the normal order of layoff, an impact upon minorities shall be evaluated, and corrective action shall be taken, for minorities as a single group that shall not be divided by ethnicity or other subclassifications.

 C. Employee Options For Transfers to Avoid Layoff (Bumping).

 Insofar as the option is available, as determined by the Director, any regular employee subject to being laid off may displace within the same employing unit the employee who has the least seniority in the displacing employee's class, or if the order of layoff reflects seniority within a budget title pursuant to SMC 4.04.220A above, in the displacing employee's budget title .

 The least-senior regular employee who is laid off or is displaced pursuant to the immediately preceding paragraph may displace the employee having the least seniority in the next lower class in a class series, or next lower budget title when (1) the displacing employee has had an appointment to such lower class or budget title, and (2) the employee to be sequentially displaced has less seniority than the displacing employee.

 Notwithstanding any other provision of this chapter,

~~1. No regular employee in a grant-funded position, in order to avoid a layoff, shall displace an employee in a position supported by other funds; and vice versa.~~2.No employee holding a part-time position, in order to avoid a layoff, shall displace a less-senior employee holding a full-time position unless the opportunity to displace an less- senior employee holding a part-time position is not available; and no employee holding a full-time position, in order to avoid a layoff, shall displace a less-senior employee holding a part-time position unless the opportunity to displace a less-senior employee holding a full-time position is not available.

 3.

In all cases, to be eligible to displace another employee in order to avoid a layoff, the displacing employee must possess the skills required to perform the duties of the position held by the employee who would be displaced.

 D. Reinstatement.

 1. The names of all employees laid off from active employment shall be placed on a reinstatement ~~register~~ list. Such ~~register~~list shall be for the class  or budget title from which they have been laid off. The entire reinstatement ~~register~~list shall be sent to any appointing authority for use in filling a vacancy in a position of that class or budget title. An appointing authority may refuse to make an appointment from the reinstatement ~~register~~list only upon stating, a reason therefor to the Director.

 2. The Director may implement programs to refer laid-off employees to vacant City positions in any employing unit; provided, that each referred employee shall possess skills commensurate with the duties of the position to be filled, as determined by the Director, and provided, further, that no such referral shall result in a promotion for the affected employee unless the employee has been ~~certified from an appropriate register~~referred as a result of an appropriate qualifications audit. An appointing authority may refuse to hire a person so referred only upon stating, in writing, a reason therefor to the Director.

 E. Notice of Layoff.

 Where a regular employee is separated by reason of layoff, when possible, thirty (30) days' prior written notice shall be given the affected employee, and at least fifteen (15) days' prior written notice shall be given unless:

 1. Delaying the layoff would cause the employing unit to exceed its revenue for personal services for the affected work or program; or

 2. The layoff is one of a number of layoffs and delaying the layoff would cause serious financial detriment to the City; or

 3. The layoff is caused by fire, storm damage, earthquake, destruction of property, strike, or any other such event that could not reasonably have been foreseen, or by peremptory state or federal legislation.

 Section 2. This ordinance shall take effect and be in force thirty

 (30) days from and after its approval by the Mayor, but if not approved and returned by the Mayor within ten (10) days after presentation, it shall take effect as provided by Municipal Code Section 1.04.020.
