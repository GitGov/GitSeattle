 AN ORDINANCE granting the Port of Seattle permission to construct, maintain and operate a vehicular overpass connecting with the West Seattle Low-Level Bridge at the north side of Southwest Spokane Street, and extending over and across West Marginal Way Southwest, and Chelan Avenue Southwest for a fifty (50) year term, specifying the conditions under which this permit is granted, and providing for acceptance of the permit and conditions.

 BE IT ORDAINED BY THE CITY OF SEATTLE AS FOLLOWS:

 Section 1. Subject to terms and conditions of this ordinance, permission is hereby granted to the Port of Seattle its successors and assigns ("Permittee") to construct, maintain, and operate a vehicular overpass connecting with the West Seattle Low-Level Bridge at the north side of Southwest Spokane Street, and extending over and across West Marginal Way Southwest, and Chelan Avenue Southwest to near 26th Avenue Southwest, in conjunction with the Port of Seattle's Southwest Harbor Project to expand Terminal 5. The overpass is forty (40) feet wide for two-way traffic, and located approximately sixteen and one-half feet above street grade.

 Section 2. The permission herein granted to the Permittee, its successors and assigns shall be for a term of fifty (50) years, commencing on the effective date of this ordinance and terminating at 11:59 p.m. on the last day of the fiftieth year, and within ninety (90) days thereafter, the permittee shall remove said vehicular overpass and shall place all portions of the street right-of-way which may have been disturbed by said vehicular overpass, in as good condition in all respects as the abutting portions, unless the permittee makes written application and the City Council grants a new ordinance for continued use and maintenance of the vehicular overpass.

 Section 3. The permission is hereby subject to the following conditions:

 a) that any protection, support or relocation of existing utilities, deemed necessary by a utility company, shall be done at the Permittee's expense, and the Permittee shall be responsible for any subsequent damage to the utilities due to construction or settlement;

 b) an alternate route for oversize loads up to twenty feet high and twenty-four feet wide shall be provided by the Port; and

 c) a maintenance agreement shall be completed between the Port and the City detailing maintenance responsibilities of the overpass.

 Section 4. The permit granted hereby is subject to primary and secondary use by the public for travel and utility purposes, and The City of Seattle ("City") expressly reserves the right to require the Permittee to remove the vehicular overpass at Permittee's sole cost and expense in the event that:

 a) The City Council determines, by ordinance, that the space occupied by the vehicular overpass is necessary for any primary or secondary public use or benefit or that the vehicular overpass interferes with any primary or secondary public use or benefit; or

 b) The Director of Engineering ("Director") determines that any term or condition of this ordinance has been violated, and such violation has not been corrected, after notice of violation having been given by the Director.

 A City Council determination that the space is necessary for a primary or secondary public use or benefit shall be conclusive and final.

 Section 5. In the event that the permission hereby granted extends to its termination in fifty (50) years, or the City orders removal of the vehicular overpass pursuant to the terms of this ordinance, then within ninety (90) days after such expiration, termination or order of removal, or prior to the date stated in an "Order to Remove", as the case may be, the Permittee shall remove the vehicular overpass and shall place all portions of the street that may have been disturbed for any part of the structure, in as good condition for public use as they were prior to construction, and in at least as good condition in all respects as the abutting portions thereof. Whereupon, the Director shall issue a certificate discharging the Permittee from responsibility under this ordinance for occurrences after the date of such discharge.

 Section 6. The Permittee shall not commence reconstruction, relocation, readjustment or repair of the vehicular overpass except under the supervision of, and in strict accordance with plans and specifications approved by the Director. The Director in his/her judgment may order such reconstruction, relocation, readjustment or repair of the vehicular overpass at the Permittee's own cost and expense because of the deterioration or unsafe condition of the vehicular overpass, grade separations, or the installation, construction, reconstruction, maintenance, operation or repair of any and all municipally owned public utilities, or for any other cause.

 Section 7. After notice to the Permittee, the Director may order the vehicular overpass closed if the Director deems that it has become unsafe or creates a risk of injury to the public. In a situation in which there is an immediate threat to the health or safety of the public, notice is not required.

 Section 8. Notwithstanding termination or expiration of the permission granted, or closure or removal of the vehicular overpass, the Permittee shall remain bound by its obligation under this ordinance until: (a) the vehicular overpass and all its equipment and property are removed from the street; (b) the area is cleared and restored in a manner and to a condition satisfactory to the Director; and (c) the Director certifies that the Permittee has discharged its obligation herein. Provided, that upon prior notice to the Permittee and entry of written findings that such is in the public interest, the Director may, in his/her sole discretion, excuse the Permittee, conditionally or absolutely, from compliance with all or any of the Permittee's obligation to remove the vehicular overpass and its property and restore disturbed areas.

 Section 9. The vehicular overpass shall remain the exclusive responsibility of the Permittee. The Permittee, by its acceptance of this ordinance and the permission hereby granted, does release the City from any and all claims resulting from damage or loss to its own property and does covenant and agree for itself, its successors and assigns, with The City of Seattle to at all times protect and save harmless The City of Seattle from all claims, actions, suits, liability, loss, costs, expense or damages of every kind and description (excepting only such damages that may result from the sole negligence of the City), which may accrue to, or be suffered by, any person or persons and/or property or properties, including without limitation, damage or injury to the Permittee, its officers, agents, employees, contractors, invitees, tenants and tenants' invitees, licensees or their successors and assigns, by reason of the maintenance, operation or use of said City street, alley or any portion thereof, or by reason of anything that has been done, or may at any time be done, by the Permittee, its successors or assigns, by reason of this ordinance, or by reason of the Permittee, its successors or assign, failing or refusing to strictly comply with each and every provision of this ordinance; and if any such suit, action or claim shall be filed, instituted or begun against the City, the Permittee, its successors or assigns, shall, upon notice thereof from the City, defend the same at its or their sole cost and expense, and in case judgment shall be rendered against the City in any suit or action, the Permittee, its successors or assigns, shall fully satisfy said judgment within 90 days after such action or suit shall have been finally determined, if determined adversely to the City. Provided that if it is determined by a court of competent jurisdiction that RCW 4.24.115 applies to this ordinance, then in the event claims or damages are caused by or result from the concurrent negligence of: (a) the City, its agents, contractors, or employees; and, (b) the Permittee, its agents, contractors, employees or its successors or assigns, this indemnity provision shall be valid and enforceable only to the extent of the negligence of the Permittee or Permittee's agents, contractors, employees or its successors or assigns.

 Section 10. For as long as the Permittee, its successors and assigns, shall exercise any permission granted by this ordinance and until the vehicular overpass is entirely removed from its location as described in Section 1 or until discharge by order of the Director of Engineering as provided in Section 7 of this ordinance, the Permittee shall obtain and maintain in full force and effect, at its own expense, insurance policies which fully protect the City from any and all claims and risks of any loss from perils which can be insured against under general liability insurance contracts and fire insurance contracts, including any extended coverage endorsements thereto which are customarily available from time to time, in conjunction with: (a) construction, reconstruction, operation, maintenance, use, or existence of the vehicular overpass permitted by this ordinance and of any and all portions of the vehicular overpass; (b) Permittee's activity upon or the use or occupation of the areas described in Section 1 of this ordinance, as well as; (c) any and all claims and risks in connection with any activity performed by the Permittee by virtue of the permission granted by this ordinance.

 Minimum insurance requirements shall be a policy of comprehensive commercial general liability of a form acceptable to the City. The City will require insurance coverage to be placed with a company admitted and licensed to conduct business in Washington State, except that if it is infeasible to obtain such a policy, the City may approve an alternative company. Minimum policy limits shall be $2,000,000 per occurrence, $4,000,000 annual aggregate each period. Coverage shall specifically name the vehicular overpass exposure. Liability coverage shall add by endorsement the City of Seattle, its elected and appointed officers, officials, employees and agents as additional insured. Coverage shall contain a Separation of Insureds indicating essentially that except with respect to the limits of insurance, and any rights or duties specifically assigned in this coverage part of the first named insured, this insurance applies as if each named insured were the only named insured, and separately to each insured against whom claim is made or suit is brought. The City will not accept a certificate of insurance as evidence of current coverage. Evidence of current coverage shall be submitted to the City in the form of a photocopy of the insurance policy declaration page, indicating all endorsements attached thereto, and is a condition to the validity of this permit.

 Whenever in the judgment of the Risk Manager of the City of Seattle, such insurance filed pursuant to the provisions hereof shall be deemed insufficient to fully protect The City of Seattle, the Permittee shall, upon demand by the Risk Manager, furnish additional insurance in such amount as may be specified by the Risk Manager.

 Section 11. The Port of Seattle shall require that any and all of its contractors performing construction work on the premises as contemplated by this permit, name the City of Seattle as an additional insured on all policies of public liability insurance, and shall include in all contract documents a provision extending construction indemnities and warranties granted to The Port of Seattle to the City as well.

 Section 12. The Permittee shall not assign, transfer, mortgage, pledge or encumber any privileges conferred by this ordinance without the consent of the City Council by resolution. If permission is granted, the assignee or transferee shall be bound by all of the terms and conditions of this ordinance. The permission conferred by this ordinance shall not be assignable or transferable by operation of law.

 Section 13. The Permittee, its successors and assigns, shall pay to the City such amounts as may be justly chargeable by said City as costs of inspection of said vehicular overpass during construction, reconstruction, repair, annual structural inspections, and at other times under the direction of the Director of Engineering.

 Section 14. The Permittee shall not discriminate against any employee or applicant for employment in connection with the design, architectural or structural engineering work or the repair, or maintenance of the vehicular overpass permitted to be erected pursuant to this ordinance, on the basis of race, religion, creed, color, sex, marital status, sexual orientation, political ideology, ancestry, age, national origin, or the presence of any sensory, mental or physical handicap unless based upon bona fide occupational qualification. The foregoing commitment shall be implemented as follows:

 a. The Permittee will take affirmative action to ensure that applicants are employed and that employees are treated during employment without regard to their race, religion, creed, color, sex, national origin or the presence of any sensory, mental or physical handicap. Such action shall include, but not be limited to, the following: employment, upgrading, demotion or transfer, recruitment or recruitment advertising, layoff or termination, rates of pay or other forms of compensation and selection for training, including apprenticeship.

 b. The Permittee shall post in conspicuous places available to such employees and applicants for such employment, notices setting forth the provisions of this non-discrimination clause.

 c. The Permittee shall furnish to the Director of Human Rights or a successor official, upon his or her request and on such forms as may be provided, a report of the affirmative action taken in implementing this provision and will permit reasonable access to its records for the purposes of determining compliance with this Section. If, upon investigation, the Director of Human Rights finds probable cause to believe that the Permittee has failed to comply with any of the terms of this Section, the Permittee and the Street Use Appeals Board (Board) will be so notified in writing. The Board shall give the Permittee at least ten (10) days notice and a hearing thereon. If the Board finds that there has been a violation of this Section, the Board may suspend the permission conferred pending full compliance with the terms of this Section.

 Failure to comply with any of the terms of this provision shall be a material violation of this ordinance.

 The foregoing paragraphs shall be inserted in any subcontracts for work undertaken pursuant to this ordinance in connection with the design, architectural or structural engineering work or the repair, or maintenance of the vehicular overpass permitted to be maintained hereunder, unless the Director of Human Rights authorizes the use of another equality of employment opportunity provision.

 Section 15. The Permittee shall deliver its written acceptance of the permission conferred by this ordinance and its terms and conditions to the Director of Engineering within sixty (60) days after the effective date of this ordinance. The acceptance shall be filed with the City Clerk. If no such acceptance is received by then, the privileges provided by this ordinance shall be deemed declined or abandoned; and the permission extended, contingent upon its acceptance, deemed lapsed and forfeited.

 Section 16. This ordinance shall take effect and be in force thirty (30) days from and after its approval by the Mayor, but if not approved and returned by the Mayor within ten (10) days after presentation, it shall take effect as provided by Municipal Code Section 1.04.020.
