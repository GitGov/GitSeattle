 ORDINANCE ______

 AN ORDINANCE relating to land use and zoning; amending the Official Land Use Map, Plat 44W, page 116, to correct a mapping error.

 WHEREAS, SMC 23.34.112 states that the Pioneer Square Mixed zone designation shall apply to those areas which lie within the Pioneer Square Preservation District; and

 WHEREAS, the legislative history regarding the creation of the Pioneer Square Historic District and its successor Pioneer Square Preservation District ("District") and the zoning designations thereof show the intent that the zone and District boundaries be one and the same, and that the District boundary was intended to be the boundary for the Pioneer Square Mixed (PSM) zone as shown on the Official Land Use Map; and

 WHEREAS, a portion of the PSM boundary west of the King County domed stadium is located further south on the Official Land Use Map than it is on the maps showing the District boundary, incorrectly reflecting the intention of the City Council; NOW, THEREFORE,

 BE IT ORDAINED BY THE CITY OF SEATTLE AS FOLLOWS:

 Section 1. Plat 44W, page 116 of the Official Land Use Map, last amended by Ordinance 115002, is amended as shown on Exhibit "A" attached hereto to place the boundary of the Pioneer Square Mixed (PSM) zone and the boundary of the Pioneer Square Preservation District in the area between the King County Stadium and Occidental Avenue South so as to coincide with the boundary of the Pioneer Square Preservation District as originally mapped.

 Section 2. The purpose of this ordinance is to correct an inadvertent mapping error and not to establish new substantive standards or new zoning classifications. The procedural requirements for text and map amendments of chapters 23.34 and 23.76 of the Seattle Municipal Code are therefore superseded for the purposes of this ordinance.

 Section 3. This ordinance shall take effect and be in force thirty (30) days from and after its approval by the Mayor, but if not approved and returned by the Mayor within ten (10) days after presentation, it shall take effect as provided by Municipal Code Section 1.04.020.

 Passed by the City Council the _____ day of ____________, 1997, and signed by me in open session in authentication of its passage this _____ day of _________________, 1997.
