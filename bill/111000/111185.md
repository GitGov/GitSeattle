 AN ORDINANCE relating to the Seattle Center Department; reducing and increasing appropriations and modifying certain Seattle Center Redevelopment projects funded in part by the proceeds of a special property tax levy approved by the voters in May 1991; and abrogating one position; all upon a three-fourths vote of the City Council.

 WHEREAS, the Seattle City Council on July 25, 1990, by Resolution 28210, adopted the Seattle Center 2000 Master Plan and by Ordinance 115593 on March 25, 1991, approved the Seattle Center 2000 Plan - Phase I; and

 WHEREAS, the citizens of Seattle on May 28, 1991, by approving a special property tax levy, provided for certain improvements at Seattle Center pursuant to the Seattle Center 2000 Plan - Phase I; and

 WHEREAS, to reflect changed conditions, the Seattle City Council has amended the Seattle Center 2000 Plan - Phase I by Ordinances 115844, 116179, 116457, 116848, 117275, 117545, and 117889; and

 WHEREAS, the Seattle Center Department has recommended and the Seattle Center Advisory Commission has approved additional changes to the Seattle Center 2000 Plan - Phase I to reflect changed conditions; Now, Therefore,

 BE IT ORDAINED BY THE CITY OF SEATTLE AS FOLLOWS:

 Section 1. Findings. The City Council makes the following findings:

 a. At the time of the 1991 Proposition One Levy, the future status of the Coliseum was uncertain, due to a proposal to build a new arena south of the Kingdome. For this reason, the Coliseum Improvements project was limited to improvements designed to maintain the operational integrity of the building pending longer-term decisions about the facility.

 b. In 1992, the original scope of the Coliseum Improvements Project was changed to include a feasibility study of renovating the Coliseum. This study established that it was possible to create a larger capacity arena within the original building footprint, and was a critical step toward the renovation of the Coliseum.

 c. Additional modifications are required to the renovated Seattle Center Coliseum (now known as "KeyArena") in order to address operational issues encountered in the first months of building operation.

 d. There is sufficient available fund balance in the Seattle Center subaccount of the Seattle Center Redevelopment and Parks Community Center Fund to add $750,000 to the budget of the Coliseum Improvements project.

 e. An increase in the budget of the Coliseum Improvements of $750,000 is consistent with the allocation of Levy funds to other major Seattle Center facilities, is consistent with the economic importance of the Coliseum ("KeyArena") to Seattle Center, and is consistent with an earlier City Council-approved change which funded a study of the feasibility of renovating the Coliseum.

 f. The Seattle Center has obtained sufficient portable fencing to meet current needs, and the remaining balance in the Site Fencing project should be made available for other capital purposes consistent with the Seattle Center 2000 Plan - Phase I.

 g. Ordinance 115844 established the Seattle Center Advisory Commission as the official Citizen Oversight Committee for the Seattle Center Levy and the implementation of the Seattle Center 2000 Plan - Phase I. In its February 1, 1996 meeting, the Seattle Center Advisory Commission voted its approval of the following actions: (1) to add $750,000 from available levy fund balance to the Coliseum Improvements project; (2) to reduce the scope of the Site Fencing project and transfer the remaining balance in that project to the Miscellaneous Site Improvements project.

 h. The Seattle Center and the City Council's Parks, Public Grounds, and Recreation Committee have reviewed the requested changes in Seattle Center levy-funded project budgets according to the Project Modification Criteria set forth in the Seattle Center Redevelopment Cooperation Agreement authorized by Ordinance 115593 and have found the proposed changes to be consistent with the Seattle Center 2000 Master Plan and to warrant the 1996 budget changes specified below:

 1. Coliseum Improvements (S9103) - Increase $750,000; Revised Budget - $2,140,000.

 2. Site Fencing (S9125) - Reduce $43,995; Revised Budget - $0.

 3. Miscellaneous Site Improvements (S9119) - Increase $43,995; Revised Budget - $833,595.

 An evaluation of the requested budget changes according to the Project Modification Criteria is included as Attachment A to this Ordinance.

 Section 2. As requested by the Seattle Center Director and recommended by the Mayor, the scope of work for two Levy-funded projects are revised as follows:

 a. The Coliseum Improvements project (S9103) scope of work is expanded to include modifications to the renovated Coliseum ("KeyArena") to correct operational issues encountered in the first months of building operation.

 b. The Site Fencing project (S9125) scope of work, previously reduced by Ordinance 116453, is further reduced to include only the purchase of portable fencing for temporary use at entry points on the grounds, and elsewhere on the grounds, as needed.

 Section 3. As requested by the Director of the Seattle Center and recommended by the Mayor, Seven Hundred and Fifty Thousand Dollars ($750,000) is hereby appropriated from the Seattle Center Redevelopment and Parks Community Center Fund, Seattle Center Subaccount, to the Coliseum Improvements project (S9103).

 Section 4. As requested by the Director of the Seattle Center and recommended by the Mayor, the unexpended and unencumbered amount listed herein is hereby reduced from the budgeted appropriations for the following project in the Seattle Center Redevelopment and Parks Community Center Fund, Seattle Center Subaccount:

 Project SFMS Reduction

 Site Fencing S9125 $43,995

 Section 5. As requested by the Seattle Center Director, and recommended by the Mayor, the unexpended and unencumbered amount listed herein is hereby reappropriated to the following project in the Seattle Center Redevelopment and Parks Community Center Fund, Seattle Center Subaccount:

 Project SFMS Reappropriation

 Miscellaneous Site Improvements S9119 $43,995

 Section 6. The Director of Seattle Center is authorized, upon compliance with State laws and City ordinances, to proceed with the preconstruction and construction activities.

 Section 7. Due to the winding down of the Seattle Center levy construction program, the following position is abrogated in the Seattle Center Department, effective April 30, 1996: TITLE SFMS Pocket No. FTE Administrative Specialist II S5100 016425 1.0

 Section 8. Any act consistent with the authority and prior to the effective date of this ordinance is hereby ratified and confirmed.

 Section 9. The foregoing appropriation is made to meet actual necessary expenditures of the City for which no appropriation has been made due to causes which could not reasonably have been foreseen at the time of the adoption of the 1996 Budget.

 Section 10. This ordinance shall take effect and be in force thirty (30) days from and after its approval by the Mayor, but if not approved and returned by the Mayor within ten (10) days after presentation, it shall take effect as provided by Municipal Code Section 1.04.020.
