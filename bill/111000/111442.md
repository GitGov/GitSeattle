 AN ORDINANCE relating to the temporary employment service, amending Seattle Municipal Code Section 4.04.045 authorizing the Personnel Director to delegate the authority to create an unspecified number of positions to be used by department heads.

 WHEREAS, SMC 4.04.045 authorizes the Personnel Director to develop and implement a temporary employment service to provide temporary workers to City employing units; and

 WHEREAS, the Personnel Director is also authorized, with the approval of the Budget Director, to fill whatever number of positions he/she determines necessary to operate the temporary employment service; and

 WHEREAS, the delegation of authority to department heads to appoint temporary employees for uncommon or special occupations would improve the efficiency and reduce the cost of temporary employment processes; Now Therefore,

 BE IT ORDAINED BY THE CITY OF SEATTLE AS FOLLOWS:

 Section 1. Seattle Municipal Code Section 4.04.045, Ordinance 114811, is amended as follows:

 4.04.045 Temporary employment service

 A. The Personnel Director is authorized to develop and implement a temporary employment service to provide temporary workers to City employing units upon request therefor and upon payment by the requesting employing unit of the cost of such service. Because an arbitrary limitation on the number of temporary workers to be hired to implement this authorization would impede the operation of such service, all positions to be occupied by such temporary workers are hereby created, and the Personnel Director is authorized, with approval of the Budget Director or his/her designee, to fill whatever number of positions he/she determines is necessary to operate such service for City employing units. The Personnel Director may delegate authority to fill temporary worker positions when such delegation would improve the quality of the temporary employment service or would result in cost efficiencies.

 Section 2 . This ordinance shall take effect and be in force thirty (30) days from and after its approval by the Mayor, but if not approved and returned by the Mayor within ten (10) days after presentation, it shall take effect as provided by Municipal Code Section 1.04.020.
