 BE IT ORDAINED BY THE CITY OF SEATTLE AS FOLLOWS:

 Section 1. Subject to terms and conditions of this ordinance, permission is hereby granted to the Board of Regents of the University of Washington, its successors and assigns ("Permittee"), to construct, maintain, and operate utility tunnels approximately nine feet in width at the following locations, (a) under and across Brooklyn Avenue Northeast, at approximately 300 feet south of Northeast Pacific Street; (b) under and across Fifteenth Avenue Northeast, at approximately 640 feet south of Northeast Pacific Street; (c) under and across University Way Northeast, from 260 feet south to 170 feet north of Northeast Pacific Street; (d) under and across the alley between University Way Northeast and 15th Avenue Northeast, at approximately 320 feet south of Northeast Pacific Street; and (e) under and across relocated 15th Avenue Northeast at approximately 245 feet south of Northeast Pacific Street; all to be used by the Permittee for the purpose of running utility lines including but not limited to cooling water and return lines, steam mains and return lines, compressed air lines, electrical conduits, and communication cables.

 Section 2. The permission herein granted to the Permittee, it's successors and assigns shall be for a term of thirty (30) years, commencing on the effective date of this ordinance and terminating at 11:59 p.m. on the last day of the thirtieth year, and within one hundred eighty (180) days thereafter,the permittee shall remove said utility tunnels and shall place all portions of the street right-of- way which may have been disturbed by said utility tunnels, in as good condition in all respects as the abutting portions, unless the permittee makes written application and the City Council grants a new ordinance for continued use and maintenance of the utility tunnels.

 Section 3. In addition to such terms and conditions as the City Council may impose pursuant to SMC 15.04.090, the permission granted is hereby subject to the following conditions:

 (a) that any protection, support, relocation or replacement of any and all existing utilities, as deemed necessary by a utility company, shall be done at the Permittee's cost and expense;

 (b) that any street tree removed for the construction of the utility tunnels shall be replaced at the University of Washington's expense as approved by the City Arborist, pursuant to SMC 15.04.090;

 (c) that alternative routes with appropriate signage shall be provided if pedestrian and/or bicycle pathways are disturbed or blocked by tunnel construction activities; and

 (d) that all street areas disturbed for the construction of the utility tunnels shall be restored by the University of Washington at its own cost and expense.

 Section 4. The permit granted hereby is subject to primary and secondary use by the public for travel and utilities purposes, and The City of Seattle ("City") expressly reserves the right to require the Permittee to remove or relocate the utility tunnels or any portion thereof, at Permittee's sole cost and expense in the event that:

 (a) The City Council determines, by ordinance, that the space occupied by the utility tunnels is necessary for any primary or secondary public use or benefit or that the utility tunnels interfere with any primary or secondary public use or benefit, including grade separations, or the installation, construction, reconstruction, maintenance, operation or repair of any and all municipally owned public utilities, or for any other cause; or

 (b) The Director of Engineering or officer of the City determines that any term or condition of this ordinance has been violated.

 A City Council determination that the space is necessary for a primary or secondary public use or benefit shall be conclusive and final. Provided, however, that the City shall allow the Permittee to relocate of the tunnels.

 Section 5. In the event that the permit is not renewed by the Permittee, or the permission hereby granted extends to its termination in thirty (30) years, or the City orders removal of the utility tunnels pursuant to the terms of this ordinance, then within one hundred eighty (180) days after such expiration, termination or order of removal, or prior to the date stated in an "Order to Remove", as the case may be, the Permittee shall remove the utility tunnels and shall place all portions of the street that may have been disturbed for any part of the structures, in as good condition for public use as they were prior to construction, and in at least as good condition in all respects as the abutting portions thereof. Whereupon, the Director shall issue a certificate discharging the Permittee from responsibility under this ordinance for occurrences after the date of such discharge.

 Section 6. The Permittee shall not commence reconstruction, relocation, readjustment or repair of the utility tunnels except with the approval of, and in strict accordance with plans and specifications approved by the Director of Engineering ("Director"). Because of the deterioration or unsafe condition of the utility tunnels, or any portion thereof, the Director in his/her judgement may order reconstruction, readjustment or repair of the utility tunnels at the Permittee's own cost and expense.

 Section 7. After notice to the Permittee, the Director may order a utility tunnel closed if the Director deems that it has become unsafe or creates a risk of injury to the public. In a situation in which there is an immediate threat to the health or safety of the public, notice is not required.

 Section 8. Notwithstanding termination or expiration of the permission granted, or closure or removal of the utility tunnels the Permittee shall remain bound by its obligation under this ordinance until: (a) the utility tunnels and all equipment and property are removed from the street right-of-way; (b) the area is cleared and restored in a manner and to a condition satisfactory to the Director; and (c) the Director certifies that the Permittee has discharged its obligation herein. Provided, that upon prior notice to the Permittee and entry of written findings that such is in the public interest, the Director may, in his/her sole discretion, excuse the Permittee, conditionally or absolutely, from compliance with all or any of the Permittee's obligation to remove the utility tunnels and its property and restore disturbed areas.

 Section 9. The utility tunnels shall remain the exclusive responsibility of the Permittee. The Permittee, by its acceptance of this ordinance and the permission hereby granted, does release the City from any and all claims resulting from damage or loss to Permittee's own property as a result of construction, maintenance and operation of the utility tunnels, and does covenant and agree for itself, its successors and assigns, with the City of Seattle to at all times protect and save harmless the City of Seattle from all claims, actions, suits, liability, loss, costs, expense or damages of every kind and description (excepting only such damages that may result from the negligence of the City), which may accrue to, or be suffered by, any person or persons and/or property or properties, including without limitation, damage or injury to the Permittee, its officers, agents, employees, contractors, invitees, tenants and tenants' invitees, licensees or their successors and assigns, by reason of the maintenance, operation or use of said utility tunnels, or by reason of anything that has been done, or may at any time be done, by the Permittee, its successors or assigns, by reason of this ordinance, or by reason of the Permittee, its successors or assign, failing or refusing to strictly comply with each and every provision of this ordinance; and if any such suit, action or claim shall be filed, instituted or begun against the City, the Permittee, its successors or assigns, shall, upon notice thereof from the City, defend the same at its or their sole cost and expense, and in case judgement shall be rendered against the City in any suit or action, the Permittee, its successors or assigns, shall fully satisfy said judgement within 90 days after such action or suit shall have been finally determined, if determined adversely to the City.

 Section 10. The Permittee shall require that any and all of its contractors performing reconstruction, repairs, maintenance or other work on the utility tunnels as contemplated by this permit, name the City of Seattle as an additional insured on all policies of public liability insurance, and shall include in all contract documents a provision extending construction indemnities and warranties granted to the University of Washington to the City as well.

 Section 11. The Permittee shall not assign, transfer, mortgage, pledge or encumber any privileges conferred by this ordinance without the consent of the City Council by resolution. If permission is granted, the assignee or transferee shall be bound by all of the terms and conditions of this ordinance.

 The permission conferred by this ordinance shall not be assignable or transferrable by operation of law.

 Section 12. The Permittee, its successors and assigns, shall pay to the City such amounts as may be chargeable by said City as costs of inspection of said utility tunnels during its construction, reconstruction, repair, maintenance or at other times under the direction of the Director of Engineering. All payments shall be made to the City Finance Director for the credit of the General Fund.

 Section 13. The Permittee shall be subject to all applicable statutes, rules, regulations and ordinances regarding non- discrimination relating to employment and access in connection with the construction, reconstruction, repair, maintenance or use of the utility tunnels.

 Section 14. The Permittee shall deliver its written acceptance of the permission conferred by this ordinance and its terms and conditions to the Director of Engineering within sixty (60) days after the effective date of this ordinance. The acceptance shall be filed with the City Clerk. If no such acceptance is received by then, the privileges provided by this ordinance shall be deemed declined or abandoned; and the permission extended, contingent upon its acceptance, deemed lapsed and forfeited.

 Section 15. This ordinance shall take effect and be in force thirty (30) days from and after its approval, by the Mayor, but not if approved and returned by the Mayor within ten (10) days after presentation, it shall take effect as provided by Municipal Code 1.04.020.
