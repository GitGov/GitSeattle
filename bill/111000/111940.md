 C. Hazardous Material Related Permits. Fees for hazardous material related permits are established in Schedule C (See Table 22.602.040C).

 In some cases these fees are based on the quantity of hazardous material stored and/or handled at the site and the relative risk posed by each material.

 1. Definitions:

 a. "Quantity Range Number" as established in the Quantity Range Table below, is a number between 1 and 2 which is assigned to a hazard category based upon the amount of hazardous material located at the site.

 b. "Assigned Risk Factor" as established below, is a number assigned to each hazard class and category of hazardous material indicating the relative hazard posed by materials in that hazard category.

 c. "Fixed permit cost" Ninety-eight Dollars ($98.00) is the minimum cost for the Seattle Fire Department to issue a hazardous material permit.

 d. "Base permit fee" is determined by multiplying the sum of the products of the quantity range number and assigned risk factor for each hazard class by the fixed permit cost divided by 1.1 and is represented by the following equation:

 Base permit fee = [((Q)(R)][F/1.1]

 Where: Q = The quantity range number.

 R = The assigned risk factor.

 F = The fixed permit cost ($98.00).

 Example:

 XYZ Company stores five hundred (500) gallons of gasoline and two hundred (200) pounds of nitric acid. Gasoline is classified as a Class I-B flammable liquid which has an assigned risk factor of 1.4. Nitric acid is classified as a corrosive liquid and a Class 1 oxidizer, both of which have an assigned risk factor of 1.1.

 Base permit fee = [(1.25)(1.4)flammable + (1)(1.1)Class 1 oxidizer][$98./1.1]

 Base permit fee = $253.91

 When a material has multiple hazards, only the hazard presented by the material that has been assigned the highest risk factor shall be considered. The base permit fee incorporates the cost of the initial site inspection plus one (1) reinspection of the facility. Any subsequent inspections will result in an additional fee based on the time charge which shall be calculated on actual costs for labor and other services.

 The annual permit renewal fee will be one-half () of the original base permit fee, if the facility is found to be in compliance with the original permit conditions.

 Effective January 1, 1993, those facilities which have existing hazardous materials-related permits authorized under Ordinance 116258 shall have their permits renewed at the rate of Seventy-Five Dollars ($75.00) until the Fire Department Article 80 program inspection and inventory analysis for the facility has been performed.

 In special circumstances, hazardous material permit fees may be adjusted, modified or combined. Authority to adjust, modify or combine such permit fees is limited to the Fire Chief, the Fire Marshal and the Assistant Fire Marshal.

 One, or a combination of more than one, of the following abbreviations shall be placed before the permit code number to indicate whether the permit applies to storage, retail sales, or use of hazardous materials or is a temporary permit:

 D. All permits listed under subsection A of this section have a base fee which incorporates the cost of an initial site inspection and one (1) site reinspection to determine compliance with the Seattle Fire Code. Any subsequent inspections will result in a fee based on a time charge which shall be calculated on actual costs for labor and other services. Such fees shall include overtime costs only when the work performed outside normal business hours (eight a.m. (8:00(())) a.m.) to four-thirty p.m. (4:30(())) p.m.)  Monday through Friday) is required by the Seattle Fire Code or is performed at the request of the owner or responsible person or permit holder.

 E. Temporary permits listed under Schedule A will not be renewed on an annual basis.

 F. Those permit applications which are required to be filed within time limitations specified under the Seattle Fire Code or by order of the Fire Chief, shall be subject to a late fee, if not filed within the prescribed time period. The late fee shall be calculated at 1.75 times the original permit fee.
