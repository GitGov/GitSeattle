 AN ORDINANCE requiring the removal of graffiti in order to protect the public health, safety and welfare, declaring that property may become a nuisance owing to the failure of responsible parties to remove graffiti after having been requested to do so by the City, establishing a process for voluntary or involuntary clean-up of graffiti and the recovery of public clean-up expenses, creating civil remedies, and adding a new chapter to Title 10 of the Seattle Municipal Code.

 WHEREAS, graffiti is criminal vandalism defacing public and private property without permission of the owner, costing citizens, businesses and the City millions of dollars annually to repair; and

 WHEREAS, graffiti can be a powerful visual symbol of disorder which erodes public safety, reduces the attractive physical qualities of neighborhoods, and can contribute to a downward spiral of blight and decay, lessening property values, business viability and ultimately tax revenues; and

 WHEREAS, reducing graffiti requires a comprehensive strategy that includes increased efforts to apprehend and hold accountable those responsible for such vandalism, the prompt removal of graffiti as soon as reasonably possible, and the encouragement of artistic expression only on appropriate spaces obtained with the permission of public and private property owners; and

 WHEREAS, there is substantial evidence that the prompt removal of graffiti is an effective prevention strategy which discourages its return while the failure to promptly remove graffiti increases the likelihood that more graffiti will occur on the same site and on other nearby property; and

 WHEREAS, the City and many property owners commit resources and energy to diligently removing graffiti and the City supports the efforts of hundreds of community, business and school volunteers who work each week to remove graffiti in their neighborhoods and business districts; and

 WHEREAS, these combined public and private efforts to reduce graffiti are undermined by those few property owners who fail to cooperate in cleaning graffiti from their property despite requests from their neighbors and the City; and

 WHEREAS, the failure to maintain one's property by removing graffiti to a reasonable degree and within a reasonable period of time constitutes a public nuisance for the reasons set forth above; and

 WHEREAS, many other jurisdictions across the United States, including Portland, Phoenix, San Diego, San Francisco and

 Los Angeles County, have adopted graffiti nuisance ordinances and have found them to be a useful tool in reducing graffiti, Now Therefore;

 BE IT ORDAINED BY THE CITY OF SEATTLE AS FOLLOWS:

 A. Identify a responsible party and send that party an informational letter describing the nature and location of the graffiti and requesting that the graffiti be removed promptly. The letter shall explain the problems caused by the continued presence of graffiti and the need for its prompt removal, describe the resources available to aid in graffiti removal, and give notice that failure to remove graffiti is a violation of City law that may lead to legal action to remove the graffiti at the expense of the responsible party and may subject the responsible party to civil penalties.
