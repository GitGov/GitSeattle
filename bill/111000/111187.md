 AN ORDINANCE relating to the Pike Place Market Preservation and Development Authority; authorizing the City to guaranty with its full faith and credit a proposed bond issue of the Authority to refund a portion of Authority bonds which the City previously had guaranteed; authorizing an amendment to the existing interlocal agreement with the Authority; and providing for certain other matters in connection therewith.

 BE IT ORDAINED BY THE CITY OF SEATTLE AS FOLLOWS:

 Section 1. Findings. The City Council hereby makes the following findings.

 The Pike Place Market Preservation and Development Authority issued its Special Obligation Bonds, Series 1991A and Series 1991B dated November 1, 1991 in the aggregate principal amount of $7,525,000 to fund a settlement agreement regarding control of the Pike Place Market arising from certain financial transactions and to pay off certain mortgages on property of the Market. The Series 1991B Bonds have been paid in full and $6,250,000 of the Series A Bonds remain outstanding.

 In Ordinance No. 115780, the City found that serving as guarantor of the Authority's Series 1991A and Series 1991B Bonds and pledging the full faith and credit of the City to guarantee their payment was necessary, proper and in the public interest, and was a public and strictly municipal purpose. Pursuant to such ordinance, the City entered into an Interlocal Cooperation Agreement with the Authority dated November 1, 1991, in which the City agreed to guaranty the payment of principal of and interest on the Series 1991A and 1991B Bonds.

 Because of favorable conditions in the bond market, it may be possible for the Authority to issue refunding bonds and use the proceeds thereof to advance refund $5,755,000 of the Series 1991A Bonds. Such a refunding, if secured by the guaranty of the City, will realize significant debt service savings to the Authority over the life of the refunding bonds.

 The proposed refunding of a portion of the outstanding Series 1991A Bonds of the Authority will reduce the obligation of the City under its guarantee of such bonds. Continuing the guaranty of the Series 1991A Bonds which will not be refunded and guaranteeing the payment of the proposed refunding bonds through a pledge of the City's full faith and credit remains necessary, proper and in the public interest, and the same remains a public and strictly municipal purpose.

 A. "Amended Agreement" means the Interlocal Cooperation Agreement dated November 1, 1991 between the City and the Authority, as amended to set forth the terms and conditions relating to the issuance of the 1996 Bonds, the use of the proceeds thereof and for certain other matters in connection therewith.
