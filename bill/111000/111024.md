 AN ORDINANCE relating to preliminary planning for Public Safety facility developments, reprogramming existing appropriations to provide funds for those preliminary planning efforts, and authorizing reimbursement of the Department of Administrative Services Operating Fund for expenditures made for those preliminary planning efforts.

 WHEREAS, Budget Ordinance No. 116944 appropriated a total of nine hundred eight thousand dollars ($908,000.00) for planning and design of a new West Police Precinct Station (project A51147, $830,921 from the Cumulative Reserve Fund, and $77,879 from the Public Safety Bond Fund); and,

 WHEREAS, initial planning revealed that a fuller examination of related Police and Municipal Courts functions, also presently located in the Public Safety Building, was required to select operational elements to be located at the new Police West Precinct Station site; and,

 WHEREAS, the Department of Administrative Services (DAS) was directed to prepare a plan and architectural program for Justice Facilities, for eventual submission to the voters in the form of a Public Safety Facilities Bond Issue; and,

 WHEREAS, Ordinance 117150 increased the Department of Administrative Services Operating Fund (DASO) expenditure allowance, to provide expenditure authorization for efforts required to prepare that plan and architectural program, with the expressed intention that those expenditures from the DASO would be reimbursed; and,

 WHEREAS, the materials were prepared and included in a Public Safety Bond Issue, submitted to the voters in November 1994, for which the voters cast a majority in favor, but which failed for lack of the 60% supermajority requirement; and,

 WHEREAS, those plans and programs, together with additional planning, studies and analysis done under these authorities, have led to current policy decisions to proceed with design and construction of a combined West Police Precinct Station and Police Communications Center (911), and further planning for siting and preliminary programming of Police Mounted Patrol facilities and Police Headquarters and citywide police operational facilities; now therefore,
