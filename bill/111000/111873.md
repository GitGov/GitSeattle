 WHEREAS, President Clinton announced a ban on new U.S. investment in Burma in April, 1997, and

 WHEREAS, the United States Supreme Court has upheld the power of a municipality to make legitimate economic decisions without being subject to the restraints of the Interstate Commerce Clause when it participates in the market place as a corporation or citizen as opposed to exerting its regulatory powers; and

 WHEREAS, the state of Massachusetts, the cities of Oakland, San Francisco and New York City have passed selective purchasing ordinances and more are considering such measures; and

 WHEREAS, Burma is an economically undeveloped country where economic boycotts may have a significant impact; and

 WHEREAS, in 1995, the Seattle City Council passed and the Mayor signed Resolution 29077 supporting the establishment of democracy and a free and open society in Burma, and appropriate action by the U.S. government to achieve these goals; and
