 ORDINANCE __________________

 AN ORDINANCE related to the purchase of goods and services governed by SMC 3.18.800 and provided by firms which have significant direct investments in Burma.

 WHEREAS, the military regime of Burma (also known as Myanmar, but hereinafter referred to as Burma) has institutionalized torture and rape as political instruments and embarked upon campaigns of forcible relocation, forced labor and slavery, and persecution of ethnic minorities, and other human rights violations, thereby denying the majority of the population the right to participate in the political process, to benefit from the system of justice, or to exercise economic rights; and

 WHEREAS, the people of Burma voted overwhelmingly for the National League for Democracy (NLD), headed by Nobel Peace Laureate Aung San Suu Kyi, and the NLD calls for sanctions and consumer boycotts; and

 WHEREAS, the U.S. State Department estimates that sixty percent of the heroin seized in the United States comes from Burma and concludes that drug money is routinely laundered by businesses and banks in Burma; and

 WHEREAS, President Clinton announced a ban on new U.S. investment in Burma in April, 1997; and

 WHEREAS, the United States Supreme Court has upheld the power of a municipality to make legitimate economic decisions without being subject to the restraints of the Interstate Commerce Clause when it participates in the market place as a corporation or citizen as opposed to exerting its regulatory powers; and

 WHEREAS, the state of Massachusetts, the cities of Oakland, San Francisco and New York City have passed selective purchasing ordinances and more cities and states are considering such measures; and

 WHEREAS, Burma is an economically undeveloped country where economic boycotts may have a significant impact; and

 WHEREAS, in 1995, the Seattle City Council passed and the Mayor signed Resolution 29077 supporting the establishment of democracy and a free and open society in Burma, and appropriate action by the U.S. government to achieve these goals; and

 WHEREAS, the Investor Responsibility Research Center (IRRC) is the recognized source of Burma investment data used by municipalities and institutions implementing selective purchase programs; Now Therefore,

 "Contract" means any purchase order or term purchase agreement of the City for commodities.

 "Goods and Services" means only those supplies, materials, and services governed by SMC 3.18.800.

 "Doing business with Burma" means having direct investments or employees assigned to work in Burma.

 "Direct investments in Burma" means having at least ten percent ownership in a business located in Burma. Businesses with direct investments include affiliates in which the parent company ultimately retains between ten percent and fifty percent equity stake, and subsidiaries in which the parent company owns more than fifty percent.

 The Investor Responsibility Research Center's quarterly publication shall be used to establish whether or not a company has direct investments in Burma.

 20.50.020 Selective Purchase Program

 The Executive Services Department is directed to develop procedures to implement a selective purchase program. This program shall require that bidders and proposers for solicitations for contracts estimated in value at One Hundred Thousand Dollars ($100,000.00) or more shall be awarded and administered in accordance with the following standards and procedures.

 Bidders or proposers whose bids are of equal value, as determined by the Executive Services Director, shall be ranked as follows: first, firms without direct investments in Burma; second, firms with direct investments in Burma.

 Contract solicitations and contracts may be exempted from this requirement where the business with direct investments in Burma is the sole source of the commodity or there is an emergency, as determined prior to bid opening by the Executive Services Director.

 This Ordinance shall be effective until December 31, 1999 and shall only apply to contract solicitations issued on or before that date.
