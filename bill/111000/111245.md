 WHEREAS, recent Local Improvement Districts are of such small financial significance that the financial expense of issuing Local Improvement District Bonds is not warranted; and

 WHEREAS, the City of Seattle has recently only infrequently created Local Improvement Districts and consolidation of bonds is not generally economical; and

 WHEREAS, RCW 35.45.150 authorizes the issuance of local improvement installment notes. Now therefore,

Loans evidenced by such notes shall comply with RCW 35.45.150. The total sum of all outstanding principal on such installment notes shall not at any time exceed one million dollars ($1,000,000).

 The Finance Director may refund such installment notes by the issuance of local improvement district bonds or consolidated local improvement district bonds in accordance with RCW Chapter 35.45, and may transfer any such notes, at par plus accrued interest among funds of the City.

 Section 2. Section 5.06.030 of the Seattle Municipal Code (Ordinance No. 110749 1 (part), as last amended by Ordinance 117641 1) is further amended by adding a new subsection as follows:

 5.06.030 Fund investments - Interfund loans.

 The Finance Director, after consulting with the Chair of the Finance Committee of the City of Council, may in his or her discretion,

 F. Sell installment notes to City funds pursuant to section 20.04.145 in connection with financing local improvement districts.

 Section 3. Any acts pursuant to the authority and prior to the effective date of this ordinance are hereby ratified and confirmed.

 Section 4. This ordinance shall take effect and be in force thirty (30) days from and after its approval by the Mayor, but if not approved and returned by the Mayor within ten (10) days after presentation, it shall take effect as provided by Municipal Code Section 1.04.020.
