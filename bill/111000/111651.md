 The life of the capital facilities to be financed with the proceeds of the Bonds exceeds the final maturity of the Bonds.

 The City Council approves the issuance of the Bonds for the purposes of Section 147(f) of the Code, to the extent applicable to the Bonds.

 Section 4. Bond Sale Resolution. The City Council may adopt the Bond Sale Resolution and in that resolution may provide for the matters described in this ordinance and such other matters that the City Council deems necessary and appropriate to carry out the purposes of this ordinance.

 The Bond Sale Resolution may provide for bond insurance and interest rate swap arrangements, and may provide conditions or covenants relating thereto, including additional terms, conditions and covenants relating to the Bonds that are required by the bond insurer and are consistent with the provisions of this ordinance, including but not limited to restrictions on investments and requirements of notice to and consent of the bond insurer. The Bond Sale Resolution may approve such other documents the City Council may deem necessary to carry out the purposes of this ordinance, including but not limited to agreements with bond insurers, remarketing agents, underwriters, fiscal agencies, interest rate swap counterparties, custodians and the Registrar. The Mayor and the Director of Finance are separately authorized to execute and deliver, on behalf of the City, any contracts consistent with the provisions of this ordinance for which the City's approval is necessary or to which the City is a party and that are related or incidental to the initial issuance and sale of the Bonds.

 The City Council may determine and specify by the Bond Sale Resolution the amount, if any, from the proceeds of or accrued interest on the Bonds to be deposited into specified funds, subfunds, accounts and subaccounts. In the absence of such a determination and specification in the Bond Sale Resolution, the Director of Finance may make such determination and specification.

 Section 5. Registration and Transfer of Bonds. The Bonds shall be issued only in registered form as to both principal and interest and shall be recorded on books or records maintained by the Registrar (the "Bond Register"). The Bond Register shall contain the name and mailing address of the owner of each Bond and the principal amount and number of each of the Bonds held by each owner.

 Bonds surrendered to the Registrar may be exchanged for Bonds in any authorized denomination of an equal aggregate principal amount and of the same series, interest rate and maturity. Bonds may be transferred only if endorsed in the manner provided thereon and surrendered to the Registrar. Any exchange or transfer shall be without cost to the owner or transferee. The Registrar shall not be obligated to exchange or transfer any Bond during the fifteen (15) days preceding any principal payment or redemption date.

 Unless provided otherwise in the Bond Sale Resolution, the Bonds initially shall be registered in the name of CEDE & CO., as the nominee of the Depository Trust Company ("DTC"). The Bonds so registered shall be held in fully immobilized form by DTC as depository. For so long as any Bonds are held in fully immobilized form, DTC or its successor depository shall be deemed to be the registered owner for all purposes hereunder and all references to registered owners, bondowners, bondholders or the like shall mean DTC or its nominees and shall not mean the owners of any beneficial interests in the Bonds. Registered ownership of such Bonds, or any portions thereof, may not thereafter be transferred except: (i) to any successor of DTC or its nominee, if that successor shall be qualified under any applicable laws to provide the services proposed to be provided by it; (ii) to any substitute depository appointed by the City or such substitute depository's successor; or (iii) to any person as provided if the Bonds are no longer held in immobilized form.

 Upon the resignation of DTC or its successor (or any substitute depository or its successor) from its functions as depository, or a determination by the City that it no longer wishes to continue the system of book entry transfers through DTC or its successor (or any substitute depository or its successor), the City may appoint a substitute depository. Any such substitute depository shall be qualified under any applicable laws to provide the services proposed to be provided by it.

 If (i) DTC or its successor (or substitute depository or its successor) resigns from its functions as depository, and no substitute depository can be obtained, or (ii) the City determines that the Bonds are to be in certificated form, then the ownership of Bonds may be transferred to any person as herein provided, and the Bonds no longer shall be held in fully immobilized form.

 The City's obligations under this ordinance and under the Bonds are to the registered owner or owners of the Bonds, and the City shall not be liable to the participants or beneficial owners of Bonds registered in the name of any nominee of DTC or a successor depository, for any acts or omissions of DTC or such successor depository.

 Section 6. Payment of Bonds. Both principal of and interest on the Bonds shall be payable in lawful money of the United States of America. Interest on the Bonds shall be paid by checks or drafts of the Registrar mailed on the interest payment date to registered owners of Bonds at the addresses for such owners as those owners and addresses appear on the Bond Register on the fifteenth (15th) day of the calendar month preceding the interest payment date. Principal of the Bonds shall be payable at maturity or on such date as may be fixed for prior redemption upon presentation and surrender of the Bonds by the registered owners at either of the principal offices of the Registrar, at the option of such registered owners. Notwithstanding the foregoing, as long as the Bonds are registered in the name of DTC or its nominee, payment of principal of and interest on the Bonds shall be made at the times and in a manner consistent with the Bond Sale Resolution and as set forth in the Letter of Representations with DTC in substantially the form on file with the Director of Finance, which Letter of Representations is hereby approved and which may be executed by the Director of Finance.

 Section 7. Redemption and Open Market Purchase of Bonds. All or some of the Bonds may be subject to redemption prior to their stated maturity at the option of the City at the times and on the terms set forth in the Bond Sale Resolution.

 The City shall redeem any term bonds, if not redeemed under the optional redemption provisions set forth above or purchased in the open market under the provisions set forth below, by lot (in such manner as the Registrar shall determine) at par plus accrued interest on the dates and in the years and principal amounts as set forth in the Bond Sale Resolution.

 If the City redeems term bonds under the optional redemption provisions set forth in the Bond Sale Resolution or purchases term bonds in the open market as set forth below, the par amount of the term bonds so redeemed or purchased (irrespective of their redemption or purchase prices) shall be credited at the par amount thereof against such remaining mandatory redemption amounts as determined by the Director of Finance or, if no such determination is made, on a pro-rata basis.

 Portions of the principal amount of any Bond may be redeemed, in installments of Five Thousand Dollars ($5,000) or any integral multiple thereof, or in such other amounts, all as determined by the Bond Sale Resolution. Except as may otherwise be provided in the Bond Sale Resolution, if less than all of the principal amount of any Bond is redeemed, on surrender of that Bond at either of the principal offices of the Registrar, there shall be issued to the registered owner, without charge therefor, a new Bond (or Bonds, at the option of the registered owner) of the same series, maturity and interest rate in any of the denominations authorized by the Bond Sale Resolution in the aggregate total principal amount remaining unredeemed.

 The City reserves the right and option to purchase any or all of the Bonds in the open market at any time at any price acceptable to the City plus accrued interest to the date of purchase.

 Except as may otherwise be provided in the Bond Sale Resolution, the City shall cause notice of any intended redemption of Bonds to be given not less than thirty (30) nor more than sixty (60) days prior to the date fixed for redemption by first-class mail, postage prepaid, to the registered owner of any Bond to be redeemed at the address appearing on the Bond Register at the time the Registrar prepares the notice, and the requirements of this sentence shall be deemed to have been fulfilled when notice has been mailed as so provided, whether or not it is actually received by the owner of any Bond. Interest on Bonds called for redemption shall cease to accrue on the date fixed for redemption unless the Bond or Bonds called are not redeemed when presented pursuant to the call. In addition, the redemption notice shall be mailed within the same period, postage prepaid, to Moody's Investors Service, Inc., and Standard & Poor's Corporation at their offices in New York, New York, or their successors, to any bond insurer for the Bonds, to each Nationally Recognized Municipal Securities Information Repository or to the Municipal Securities Rulemaking Board, to any State Information Depository for Washington State, and to such other persons and with such additional information as the Director of Finance shall determine or as specified in the Bond Sale Resolution, but none of these additional mailings shall be a condition precedent to the redemption of Bonds.

 If any Bond is not redeemed when properly presented at its maturity or call date, the City shall be obligated to pay interest on that Bond at the same rate provided in the Bond from and after its maturity or call date until that Bond, both principal and interest, is paid in full or until sufficient money for its payment in full is on deposit in the Bond Fund and the Bond has been called for payment by giving notice of that call to the registered owner of that unpaid Bond.

 Section 8. Form and Execution of Bonds. The Bonds shall be typed, printed, photocopied or lithographed on good bond paper in a form consistent with the provisions of this ordinance, the Bond Sale Resolution and State law, shall be signed by the Mayor and Director of Finance, either or both of whose signatures may be manual or in facsimile, and the seal of the City or a facsimile reproduction thereof shall be impressed or printed thereon.

 Only Bonds bearing a Certificate of Authentication in substantially the following form (with the designation of the Bonds adjusted consistent with Section 3 of this Ordinance), manually signed by the Registrar, shall be valid or obligatory for any purpose or entitled to the benefits of this ordinance:

 CERTIFICATE OF AUTHENTICATION

 WASHINGTON STATE FISCAL AGENCY

 Registrar

 By_____________________________________________

 Authorized Signer

 The authorized signing of a Certificate of Authentication shall be conclusive evidence that the Bonds so authenticated have been duly executed, authenticated and delivered and are entitled to the benefits of this ordinance.

 If any officer whose facsimile signature appears on the Bonds ceases to be an officer of the City authorized to sign bonds before the Bonds bearing his or her manual or facsimile signature are authenticated or delivered by the Registrar or issued by the City, those Bonds nevertheless may be authenticated, delivered and issued and, when authenticated, issued and delivered, shall be as binding on the City as though that person had continued to be an officer of the City authorized to sign bonds. Any Bond also may be signed on behalf of the City by any person who, on the actual date of signing of the Bond, is an officer of the City authorized to sign bonds, although he or she did not hold the required office on the date of issuance of the Bonds.

 Section 9. Registrar. The Registrar shall keep, or cause to be kept, at its principal corporate trust office, sufficient books for the registration and transfer of the Bonds which shall be open to inspection by the City at all times. The Registrar is authorized, on behalf of the City, to authenticate and deliver Bonds transferred or exchanged in accordance with the provisions of the Bonds and this ordinance, to serve as the City's paying agent for the Bonds and to carry out all of the Registrar's powers and duties under this ordinance and SMC Chapter 5.10 (Ordinance 111724) establishing a system of registration for the City's bonds and obligations, as that chapter now exists or may be amended.

 The Registrar shall be responsible for its representations contained in the Registrar's Certificate of Authentication on the Bonds. The Registrar may become the owner of Bonds with the same rights it would have if it were not the Registrar and, to the extent permitted by law, may act as depository for and permit any of its officers or directors to act as members of, or in any other capacity with respect to, any committee formed to protect the rights of Bond owners.

 Section 10. Provisions for Sale of Bonds. The Director of Finance is authorized in his or her discretion to offer the Bonds for sale at competitive bid or at a negotiated sale. If the Director of Finance determines to offer the Bonds for competitive sale, he or she is authorized to fix a date and time of sale of the Bonds, to give notice of the sale, to determine the bid requirements and the criteria for determining the best bidder, and to specify such other matters as he or she may determine necessary to carry out the sale of the Bonds, so long as the manner and terms of the sale thereof are consistent with this ordinance. The Director of Finance may, in his or her discretion, provide for the use of an electronic bidding mechanism in connection with the bidding for the sale of the Bonds.

 CUSIP numbers will be printed on the Bonds if requested in the bid of the successful bidder, but neither failure to print CUSIP numbers on any Bond nor error with respect thereto shall constitute cause for a failure or refusal by the successful bidder to accept delivery of and pay for the Bonds in accordance with its bid. All expenses in relation to the printing of CUSIP numbers on the Bonds shall be paid by the City, but the fee of the CUSIP Service Bureau for the assignment of those numbers shall be the responsibility of and shall be paid by the successful bidder.

 The City will cause the Bonds to be printed or lithographed and signed and will furnish the approving legal opinion of bond counsel regarding the Bonds, without cost to the purchaser.

 The Bonds will be delivered to the purchaser in New York, New York, within ninety (90) days after the sale date and immediately upon payment to the City of the purchase price plus accrued interest to the date of closing in immediately available federal funds in Seattle, Washington, at the City's expense or at another time or place upon which the Director of Finance and the purchaser may agree at the purchaser's expense.

 Section 11. Pledge of Taxes. For as long as any of the Bonds are outstanding, the City irrevocably pledges to include in its budget and levy taxes annually within the constitutional and statutory tax limitations provided by law without a vote of the electors of the City on all of the taxable property within the City in an amount sufficient, together with other money legally available and to be used therefor, to pay when due the principal of and interest on the Bonds, and the full faith, credit and resources of the City are pledged irrevocably for the annual levy and collection of those taxes and the prompt payment of that principal and interest.

 Section 12. Preservation of Tax Exemption for Interest on Bonds. The City covenants that it will take all actions, consistent with the terms of the Bonds, this ordinance, and the Bond Sale Resolution, reasonably within its power and necessary to prevent interest on the Bonds from being included in gross income for federal income tax purposes, and the City will neither take any action nor make or permit any use of proceeds of the Bonds or other funds of the City treated as proceeds of the Bonds at any time during the term of the Bonds which will cause interest on the Bonds to be included in gross income for federal income tax purposes. The City certifies that it has not been notified of any listing or proposed listing by the Internal Revenue Service to the effect that it is a bond issuer whose arbitrage certifications may not be relied upon.

 Section 13. Undertaking to Provide Continuing Disclosure. The City shall undertake to provide for the benefit of owners of Bonds certain annual financial information and operating data of the type included in the final official statement for those Bonds, as well as notice of specified material events respecting those Bonds, in the manner and to the extent required by United States Securities and Exchange Commission Rule 15c2-12. The particular terms of the City's undertaking shall be set forth in another ordinance or in the Bond Sale Resolution with respect to the Bonds.

 Section 14. Bonds Negotiable. The Bonds shall be negotiable instruments to the extent provided by RCW 62A.8-102 and 62A.8-105.

 Section 15. Advance Refunding or Defeasance of the Bonds. The City may issue advance refunding obligations pursuant to the laws of the State of Washington or use money available from any other lawful source to pay when due the principal of and interest on the Bonds, or any portion thereof included in a refunding or defeasance plan, and to redeem and retire, refund or defease all such then-outstanding Bonds (hereinafter collectively called the "defeased Bonds") and to pay the costs of the refunding or defeasance. If money and/or direct obligations of the United States of America maturing at a time or times and bearing interest in amounts (together with money, if necessary) sufficient to redeem and retire, refund or defease the defeased Bonds in accordance with their terms are set aside in a special trust fund or escrow account irrevocably pledged to that redemption, retirement or defeasance of defeased Bonds (hereinafter called the "trust account"), then all right and interest of the owners of the defeased Bonds in the covenants of this ordinance and in the funds and accounts obligated to the payment of the defeased Bonds shall cease and become void. The owners of defeased Bonds shall have the right to receive payment of the principal of and interest on the defeased Bonds from the trust account. The defeased Bonds shall be deemed no longer outstanding, and the City may apply any money in any other fund or account established for the payment or redemption of the defeased Bonds to any lawful purposes as it shall determine.

 Section 16. Deposit and Use of Proceeds. The Director of Finance is authorized to create and establish the Galer Street Fund and such subfunds, account(s) and subaccount(s) as he or she may deem necessary and appropriate to carry out the purposes of this ordinance. Unless provided otherwise in the Bond Sale Resolution, the principal proceeds and premium, if any, received from the sale and delivery of the Bonds shall be paid into or allocated to such accounts or subaccounts of the Galer Street Fund and such other funds as the Director of Finance may designate and used for the purposes set forth in Section 3 of this ordinance.

 The Director of Finance may establish and may transfer Bond proceeds among such accounts and subaccounts in the Galer Street Fund or other funds, or make interfund loans from other City accounts or funds and is authorized to make such transfer or deposit on terms he or she may deem necessary and appropriate to carry out the purposes of this ordinance and consistent with the Bond Sale Resolution.

 There previously has been created and established in the City Treasury a special fund designated as the Bond Interest and Redemption Fund (the "Bond Fund"). Accrued interest on the Bonds, if any, received from the sale and delivery of the Bonds shall be paid or allocated into the Bond Fund prior to the first debt service date with respect to those Bonds.

 Until needed to pay the costs described herein, the City may invest principal proceeds of the Bonds temporarily in any legal investment, and the investment earnings shall be deposited in such funds and accounts as may be designated by the Director of Finance. Earnings subject to a federal tax or rebate requirement may be withdrawn from any such fund or account and used for those tax or rebate purposes. All taxes collected for and allocated to the payment of the principal of and interest on the Bonds shall be deposited in the Bond Fund.

 Any Bond proceeds remaining after the accomplishment of the purposes set forth in Section 3 and in this Section 16, or after the City Council has determined that the expenditure of Bond proceeds for those purposes is no longer necessary or appropriate, may be used to pay principal of and interest on the Bonds consistent with applicable law.

 Section 17. Appropriation and Expenditure Allowance. For design activities related to the West Galer Street Grade Crossing Project, there is hereby appropriated One Million Dollars ($1,000,000) from the Galer Street Fund, and the expenditure allowance in the Program Category below in the 1997 Budget of Seattle Transportation is accordingly increased as follows:

 Fund Department Object of Expenditure Amount

 For carrying out the West Galer Street Grade Crossing Project, there is hereby appropriated Four Million Dollars ($4,000,000) or so much thereof as is available from the Galer Street Fund to the budget of the Department of Finance General, for expenditure from the Galer Street Fund by and under the control of the Director of the Office of Management and Planning subject to the condition in Section 18. The City further agrees to leaving a Galer Street access open at Elliott Avenue.

 Section 18. Condition of Construction Expenditures. The City will not proceed with the construction phase of the West Galer Street Grade Crossing Project until the Director of Seattle Transportation certifies, by letter to the President of the City Council, that Immunex Corporation has completed construction of utilities and site work for its new headquarters project at Terminal 88 in the City of Seattle. Nothing in this section prevents or places conditions on the transfer or deposit of Bond proceeds into a special fund or account in the City Treasury where, in combination with money from other sources, those proceeds are to be set aside for carrying out the West Galer Street Grade Crossing Project.

 Section 19. Temporary Bond. Pending the printing, execution and delivery to the purchaser of definitive Bonds, the City may cause to be executed and delivered to the purchaser a single temporary Bond in the total principal amount of the relevant Bonds. The temporary Bond shall bear the same date of issuance, interest rates, principal payment dates and terms and covenants as the definitive Bonds, shall be issued as a fully registered Bond in the name of the purchaser, and shall be in such form as is acceptable to the purchaser. Such temporary Bond shall be exchanged for the definitive Bonds as soon as the same are printed, executed and available for delivery.

 Section 20. General Authorization. The Mayor and the Director of Finance and each of the other appropriate officers of the City are each authorized and directed to do everything as in their judgment may be necessary, appropriate or desirable in order to carry out the terms and provisions of, and complete the transactions contemplated by, this ordinance.

 Section 21. Severability. If any one or more of the provisions of this ordinance or of the covenants or agreements provided in this ordinance to be performed on the part of the City shall be declared by any court of competent jurisdiction and of last resort to be contrary to law, then such provision, covenant or covenants, agreement or agreements shall be null and void and shall be separable from the remaining provisions, covenants and agreements in this ordinance and shall in no way affect the validity of the other provisions of this ordinance.
