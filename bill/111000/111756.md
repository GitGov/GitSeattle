 AN ORDINANCE relating to transportation improvements; providing for the submission to the voters of the City at an election to be held therein on November 4, 1997, of a proposition authorizing the City to incur indebtedness by issuing its general obligation bonds, payable by annual property tax levies and by other money of the City legally available therefor, for the purpose of paying all or a part of the cost of transportation improvements and to levy those excess property taxes.

 WHEREAS, The City of Seattle, Washington (the "City"), possesses a transportation system that is vital to the economic vitality of the City and the enhancement of the City's quality of life and is an important public function; and

 WHEREAS, the City's transportation system has major restoration and system development needs that cannot be funded with existing funding sources; and

 WHEREAS, the City's transportation system needs have exceeded the City's ability to fund them from existing revenue sources and the City's share of state authorized transportation revenues has declined over the years; and

 WHEREAS, the City adopted the state-authorized Street Utility local option to fund certain transportation improvements and subsequently the City suspended the Street Utility's charges as a result of an adverse State Supreme Court ruling; and

 WHEREAS, the City appointed a Citizens' Transportation Advisory Committee ("CTAC") to recommend funding strategies for the City's transportation system to meet the City's transportation system needs; and

 WHEREAS, CTAC recommended several funding strategies, including seeking state funding increases and seeking voter approval for increased funding for the transportation system; and

 WHEREAS, the 1997 State Legislature did not pass additional local transportation revenue proposals supported by the City; and

 WHEREAS, citizens have indicated their concern about the condition of the City's transportation system; NOW, THEREFORE,

 BE IT ORDAINED BY THE CITY OF SEATTLE as follows:

 Section 1. The City is authorized to construct transportation improvements (the "Improvements") selected from the project list in Attachment A, incorporated herein by reference, or added through the process described in Section 3. The Improvements shall include but need not be limited to, the following elements:

 Restoration and Preservation Improvements Element (including paving, bridges, etc.)

 Improvements including but not limited to street paving (including in industrial areas); major street reconstruction; bridge approaches; traffic signals, systems and controllers; traffic control devices; roadway structures (including retaining walls and structural slopes); structural support connections; cathodic protection; electrical and mechanical control and drive mechanisms in bridges; stairways; and sidewalk reconstruction

 $74,744,800

 Other Improvements Element

 Neighborhood (residential and business area) transportation capital improvements identified through a City approved neighborhood plan (includes plans prepared through the Neighborhood Planning Office's program and via other methods, such as a Neighborhood Matching Fund grant for transportation planning); neighborhood business district improvements; improvements necessary for traffic control devices; new sidewalks; and trails

 $15,255,200

 Subject to Section 3, the dollar amount shown for each element above shall be the target minimum to be spent on projects within that element. The estimated cost of the Improvements, including the costs of issuing and selling the bonds authorized by this ordinance, is declared to be, as nearly as may be, Ninety Million Dollars ($90,000,000). The economic life of the Improvements is expected to be at least 6 (six) years.

 Section 2. The City is authorized to borrow an amount not to exceed Ninety Million Dollars ($90,000,000) on the credit of the City and to issue and sell its general obligation bonds in an amount not to exceed that principal amount for strictly municipal capital purposes, other than the replacement of equipment, to provide all or part of the funds for the Improvements. Costs of engineering, architectural, planning, Improvements management, financial, legal and other services lawfully incurred incident to the Improvements, costs of issuance of the bonds, and an apportionment equal to not more than one percent (1%) of construction expenditures of the Improvements upon public works for art pursuant to Seattle Municipal Code Section 20.32.030, shall be appropriate capital costs to be paid from the proceeds of the bonds authorized by this ordinance.

 The City Council declares that to the extent, if any, the City prior to the date that bonds or other short-term obligations are issued to finance the Improvements shall make capital expenditures for the Improvements from funds that are not (and are not reasonably expected to be) reserved, allocated on a long-term basis or otherwise set aside by the City under its existing and reasonably foreseeable budgetary and financial circumstances to finance the Improvements, those capital expenditures are intended to be reimbursed out of proceeds of the bonds or other short-term obligations issued in an amount not to exceed the principal amount authorized by this ordinance.

 Section 3. The City shall select projects to be financed with bond proceeds by listing the selected projects in the annual Transportation Capital Improvement Program (the "CIP"). Any projects shown in Attachment A, whether on the "Proposed Projects" list or the "Supplemental Projects " list, may be funded with bond proceeds when these projects are in a CIP that the City Council adopts by ordinance.

 It is the City's intention that the "Proposed Projects" within an element will be carried out before "Supplemental Projects," but because the City anticipates using money from grants, investment earnings and other sources to pay for part of the cost of projects, the City reserves the right to include any of the projects on Attachment A in the CIP as projects to be funded from bond proceeds. Projects may be added to the elements set forth in Attachment A, and new elements may be added to Attachment A, only by an ordinance amending the list set forth in Attachment A, passed by the City Council after a public hearing and after Council consideration of the recommendation of the Oversight Committee created pursuant to Section 6 (the "Oversight Committee"). Projects or elements added to those in Attachment A may thereafter be funded from bond proceeds by inclusion in the adopted CIP.

 The funding target minimums for elements shown in Section 1 shall be cumulative over the life of the program of Improvements, and shall not be deemed to establish annual proportions or requirements for spending. The allocation of bond proceeds between elements may be changed only by an ordinance amending the list set forth in Attachment A passed by the City Council after a public hearing and after Council consideration of the recommendation of the Oversight Committee.

 Section 4. The City may seek supplemental, matching or additional funds from other sources to pay all or part of the cost of the Improvements or any element thereof and, if successful, may apply such funds to accomplishment thereof or to complement or enlarge any portion of the Improvements.

 The City may execute joint use agreements with other public entities, grant temporary permits, leases, concessions or franchises and make other arrangements for use of the Improvements so long as the right, privilege or use granted furthers the purposes for which the Improvements were constructed.

 Section 5. The bonds shall be issued in one or more series, or as a part of a combined issue or issues with other authorized bonds and shall be issued within six (6) years of the date of voter approval of the bonds. The bonds also may evidence a line or lines of credit. The bonds shall be fully registered; shall bear interest (which may be fixed or variable) payable as permitted by law; may mature serially or as term bonds with the longest maturities being within six (6) years from their date or within any shorter period fixed by ordinance; and shall be issued and sold in the manner, at the times and in the amounts as shall be determined by or pursuant to ordinance. The exact date, form, terms, options of prior redemption, price, interest rate or rates and maturities of the bonds and pledges and covenants shall be fixed hereafter by or pursuant to ordinance. The bonds shall be paid by annual property tax levies sufficient in amount to pay both principal and interest when due, which annual property tax levies shall be made in excess of regular property tax levies without limitation as to rate or amount but only in amounts sufficient to pay both principal and interest when due.

 Pending the issuance of the bonds and receipt of their proceeds, the City may authorize the issuance of short-term obligations pursuant to chapter 39.50 RCW, and the costs of those short-term obligations shall be included in the cost of the Improvements for which the bonds are issued.

 Section 6. The City shall create an Oversight Committee to monitor the Improvements for progress and compliance with the terms of this ordinance and other ordinances relating to the issuance of the bonds. As provided in Section 3, the Oversight Committee shall review and make a recommendation to the City Council on any proposal to add projects to the elements set forth in Attachment A, to add a new element to Attachment A, or to change the allocation of bond proceeds between elements. The Director of Seattle Transportation (or his or her functional successor) shall submit to the Oversight Committee at least annually a report on the progress in completing the Improvements; a report on leveraged funds obtained from grants, other agencies, or other sources to help pay the cost of the Improvements; and a comparison of actual to budgeted expenditures for each project. The Oversight Committee shall report to the Mayor and the City Council at least annually, and more often if required by ordinance, on the progress in completing the Improvements and compliance with the terms of this and other ordinances related to the Improvements.

 The Oversight Committee shall consist of thirteen (13) members. The Mayor shall appoint six (6) members, and the chair of the City Council's Transportation Committee (or its functional successor) shall appoint seven (7) members, and all appointees shall be subject to confirmation by the City Council. Vacancies shall be filled in the same manner as initial appointments are made. Committee members shall serve without compensation. Terms of office of Committee members shall be three years, except the terms of the initial appointees shall be two or three years so that the terms have staggered end dates. The Director of Seattle Transportation, assisted by the Director of the Office of Management and Planning (or their functional successors), shall provide staff and logistical support to the Committee.

 Section 7. The City Council requests that the Director of Records and Elections of King County, Washington, as ex officio Supervisor of Elections, conduct an election in the City at the general election to be held on November 4, 1997, for the purpose of submitting to the qualified electors of the City for their approval the question of whether or not the City shall be authorized to borrow money in an amount not to exceed Ninety Million Dollars ($90,000,000), issue its general obligation bonds in that principal amount only for capital purposes other than replacement of equipment, and levy the excess taxes necessary to redeem the bonds as herein set forth.

 Section 8. The City Clerk is directed promptly to certify to the Director of Records and Elections of King County, Washington, as ex officio Supervisor of Elections, a copy of this ordinance and the proposition to be submitted at the November 4, 1997 regular election in the form of a ballot title as follows:
