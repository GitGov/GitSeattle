 AN ORDINANCE relating to the Seattle City Light Department; amending Seattle Municipal Code Section 21.49.058 to add an optional experimental rate schedule for High Demand General Service customers.

 WHEREAS, Seattle Municipal Code Chapter 21.49, Ordinance 110733 (adopted August 23, 1982) established rates for Seattle City Light and has been amended by Ordinances 110829, 110919, 111104, 111243, 111615, 112441, 112637, 112738, 113636, 114459, 114835, 115951, 116291, 116619, 117115, and 117490; and

 WHEREAS, as a result of a 1996 amendment to City Light's contract with the Bonneville Power Administration (BPA), City Light will be buying (or paying an availability charge for) a smaller proportion of power from BPA and will be obtaining a greater proportion of power from non- firm energy sources; and

 WHEREAS, obtaining more power from non-firm energy sources is expected to produce substantial benefit to the utility overall even though it also involves exposure to price risk; and

 WHEREAS, it would be to City Light's benefit to share that risk with its largest customers; and

 WHEREAS, several of City Light's largest customers have requested that City Light provide them access to the non-firm energy market and market-based prices; NOW THEREFORE,

 BE IT ORDAINED BY THE CITY OF SEATTLE AS FOLLOWS:
