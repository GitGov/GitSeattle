 AN ORDINANCE relating to snowplows; authorizing and directing the Executive Services Department, with the advice of the Transportation Department, to purchase additional snowplows for mounting on existing City trucks in order to increase the City's ability to plow snow from city streets; and making an appropriation therefor; all by a three- fourths vote of the City Council.

 WHEREAS, it is in the interest of public safety to improve the City's ability to clear city streets of snow and sand them so that fire apparatus, emergency medical units, police cars, ambulances, and other emergency vehicles are able to navigate City streets;

 WHEREAS, it is in the interest of the public welfare to improve the City's ability to clear snow from and sand city streets so that disruptions of commerce, education, and transportation can be reduced;

 WHEREAS, the City's ability to clear snow from and sand city streets is currently hampered by a shortage of snow moving and sanding equipment;

 WHEREAS, the City owns or is already acquiring and the Seattle Transportation Department operates several trucks which can be modified and mounted with snowplows and/or sanders;

 WHEREAS, the Executive Services Department estimates it could purchase two (2) used snowplows and two (2) new sanders suitable for mounting on two (2) existing flusher trucks and three (3) new snowplows suitable for mounting on existing and already-ordered hotbox trucks for approximately One Hundred Thirty-One Thousand Dollars ($131,000) in the aggregate;

 WHEREAS, the Executive Services Department estimates that an annual payment of Twenty-five Thousand Dollars ($25,000) from the Transportation Department would be appropriate to cover maintenance, repair, and a reserve for replacement; and
