 AN ORDINANCE relating to emergency repairs due to landslides; making a

 supplemental and partially reimbursable appropriation from the Emergency Fund for various projects by the Engineering Department and the Department of Parks and Recreation and clean up costs resulting from the 1995-96 storms; authorizing work to proceed; establishing an immediate effective date and declaring an emergency therefor; all by a three fourths vote of the City Council.

 WHEREAS, the severe weather conditions and heavy rain from storms of the 1995-96 winter resulted in damage to City structures that the City has determined are in need of immediate repair to protect public safety, and

 WHEREAS, these are unplanned and unfunded repairs, and

 WHEREAS, some of the expenses relating to these repair projects and other storm costs are eligible for reimbursement from the Federal Emergency Management Agency and the State of Washington, Now Therefore:

 BE IT ORDAINED BY THE CITY OF SEATTLE AS FOLLOWS:

 Section 1. For unanticipated repairs related to wind and rain damage, the expenditure allowance in the 1996 Engineering Department is increased as follows, as a supplement to the existing expenditure authority granted in Ordinance 117916:

 Fund Department Object of Expenditure Amount

 10310 ET0 Transportation CO - Capital Outlay $901,000

 Division

 EA810 E0 Engineering OC - Other Charges $122,000

 For these purposes related to projects listed in Attachment A, the sum of One Million Twenty Three Thousand Dollars ($1,023,000), or so much thereof as may be necessary, is hereby appropriated from the Emergency Fund, Emergency Subfund. The Director of Engineering is authorized to proceed with slide stabilization, restoration and prevention activities for the appropriate projects listed in Attachmnent A.

 Section 2. As requested by the Superintendent of Parks and Recreation and recommended by the Mayor, the Superintendent is authorized to proceed with regrading, slope stabilization, and other restorative and preventive measures at the slide area in the 1700 block of Magnolia Boulevard West, between Magnolia Boulevard and Perkins Lane, and to enter into such agreements with other City departments, governments, private organizations, firms and individuals as are necessary to carry out and complete the project. For such purposes, the sum of Nine Hundred Thousand Dollars ($900,000) is hereby appropriated from the Emergency Fund, Emergency Subfund.

 Section 3. These appropriations from the Emergency Fund shall be reimbursed to the maximum extent possible from the proceeds of grants received from the Federal Emergency Management Agency and the State of Washington. Such funds when received are hereby accepted for such purposes and shall be deposited into the Emergency Fund.

 Section 4. The heavy rains during the winter of 1995-1996 caused landslides which damaged several City structures and utility facilities as itemized in Attachment A and the cover letter in this ordinance file. City forces, assisted by technical consultants, worked diligently to determine the best approach to remedying each problem, once soils dried out enough during spring and summer to permit safe investigation and testing. The City now has formulated plans for remedial action. But wet winter weather is fast approaching. If the planned work is not done immediately, the upcoming wet seasonal weather will exacerbate existing damage, causing the risk of further damage and harm to the public safety and to City facilities. Therefore, the City Council finds that an emergency exists in which it is necessary for the immediate preservation of public safety that this ordinance become effective without delay.

 Section 5. The foregoing appropriations are made to meet actual necessary expenditures of the City for which no or insufficient appropriations have been made due to causes which could not reasonably have been foreseen at the time of the adoption of the 1996 budget. Now, Therefore, in accordance with RCW 35.32A.060 by reason of the facts stated above and the emergency due to storms which has been declared to exist, this ordinance shall take effect immediately upon approval or signing of the same by the Mayor.

 Passed by a three-fourths vote of all the members of the City Council the ________ day of _________, 1996, and signed by me in open session in authentication of its passage this ________ day of _________, 1996.

 ________________________________ President of the City Council Approved by me this ________ day of _________, 1996. ________________________________ Mayor Filed by me this ________ day of _________, 1996. ________________________________ City Clerk (Seal)
