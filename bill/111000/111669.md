 AN ORDINANCE relating to the Community Development Block Grant Float Loan Program; authorizing a short-term loan of up to Two Million Five Hundred Fifty Thousand Dollars ($ 2,550,000) in Block Grant funds to Rose & Associates, L.L.C., a Washington limited liability company, doing business as Hilltop Red Apple Market, for an economic development project involving the refinancing of existing debt on the Hilltop Red Apple Market.

 WHEREAS, the City Council, by Ordinance 116402, adopted policies for short-term loans of Community Development Block Grant ("CDBG") funds, known as "CD Float Loans"; and

 WHEREAS, the City's Director of the Office of Economic Development has identified an economic development project in which the City would provide a short term loan to Rose & Associates, L.L.C., dba Hilltop Red Apple Market to assist in refinancing an existing loan from Associate Grocers; and

 WHEREAS, the loan will improve the store's cash flow, allowing it to better compete, and thus continue to provide goods and services to the Beacon Hill neighborhood; and

 WHEREAS, the benefits of these grocery services are available to all the residents in a particular area where at least 51 percent of the residents are low and moderate income persons, which benefit will satisfy the CD Float Loan policies, and the City's Loan Committee has approved the proposed loan in accordance with those policies; and

 WHEREAS, the City's Comprehensive Plan under Economic Development (E30) states that the City will strive to provide a wide range of goods and services to residents and businesses in urban centers and villages by encouraging appropriate retail development in these areas; (E40) states that the city will target programmatic resources, including small business capital access and entrepreneurship training programs, as well as new infrastructure investment toward the economic development objectives of distressed areas; and

 WHEREAS, the Hilltop Red Apple Market project, by providing a range of goods and services to residents in the Central Area of Seattle, a distressed area, will fulfill important policies of the City; and

 WHEREAS, the making of the proposed loan will not impair the implementation of other projects or programs of the City using CDBG funds;
