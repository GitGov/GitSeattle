 ORDINANCE .

 AN ORDINANCE relating to taxicab inspections; adding a one-half time inspector position to the Finance Division of the Executive Services Department to conduct inspections, testing, and other enforcement actions pertaining to the taxicab industry; increasing the 1997 expenditure allowance for the Executive Services Department; and making a reimbursable appropriation from the Supplemental Appropriation Account of the Emergency Subfund.

 WHEREAS, on October 21, 1996, the City Council passed and the Mayor signed Ordinance 118341 (taxicab ordinance), which increased regulatory requirements for taxicabs and increased the enforcement workload for City staff assigned to regulate the industry; and

 WHEREAS, the "Taxicab Peer Review of Seattle Taxicab Regulation" prepared at the City's request by regulators from Las Vegas and San Diego and a transportation expert from North Carolina State University, and submitted on March 20, 1996, concluded that "taxicab enforcement is currently woefully inadequate"; and

 WHEREAS, the taxicab advisory group, made up of representatives of the taxicab industry, taxi users, the business community, King County regulators, the Port of Seattle, Metro, and the hospitality industry concurred with the Taxicab Peer Review Report; and

 WHEREAS, during the semi-annual inspection of the 842 City and County taxicabs at the City's Charles Street location it is impossible to accomplish field inspections and other enforcement efforts with the 1.3 FTEs assigned to the taxicab detail; and

 WHEREAS, the taxicab industry provides an important part of the City's image for tourists and is an integral part of the City's transportation system and the City is conducting efforts to improve the appearance and quality of the taxicab industry, and

 WHEREAS, adding a one-half time inspector would allow increased enforcement of taxi regulations and would provide for more enforcement in the evening hours; and

 WHEREAS, the fines and re-inspection fees established by Ordinance 118341 will generate enough new revenue to pay the cost of the additional one-half time position, beyond the revenues assumed at the time of the adoption of the 1997 budget; Now, Therefore,

 BE IT ORDAINED BY THE CITY OF SEATTLE AS FOLLOWS:

 Section 1. A half-time Licenses and Standards Inspector position is hereby created in the Executive Services Department. The Executive Services Director is authorized to fill this position subject to personnel ordinances of the city. This position will sunset on January 1, 1999, unless extended in the 1999 budget. This position shall be assigned solely to taxicab enforcement efforts and existing staffing for these efforts will not be reduced.

 Section 2. To pay costs associated with the position created in Section 1,the expenditure allowance in the 1997 budget of the Executive Services Department is increased in the amount of Six Thousand Two Hundred Fifty Dollars ($6,250), or as much thereof as may be necessary, by the appropriation of a like amount from the Supplemental Appropriation Account of the Emergency Subfund. The Emergency Subfund shall be reimbursed at the end of 1997 by funds accumulating in the General Fund as a result of taxicab inspections fees and fines.

 Section 3. Any acts consistent with the authority but prior to the effective date of this ordinance are hereby ratified and confirmed.

 Section 4. The foregoing appropriation is made to meet actual necessary expenditures of the City for which insufficient appropriations have been made due to causes that could not reasonably have been foreseen at the time of the adoption of the 1997 Budget; Now, Therefore, in accordance with RCW 35.32A.060, by reason of the facts above stated, this ordinance shall take effect and be in force thirty (30) days from and after its approval by the Mayor, but if not approved and returned by the Mayor within ten (10) days after presentation, it shall take effect as provided by Municipal Code Section 1.04.020.

 PASSED by the City Council on the ______ day of ______________, 1997, and signed by me in open session in authentication of its passage this _____ day of _______________, 1997.
