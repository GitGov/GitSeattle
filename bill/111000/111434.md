 WHEREAS, by Ordinance 114029, as amended, the City has established a "TDR Bank" and authorized the Director of Housing and Human Services ("DHHS Director") to negotiate the purchase of transferable development rights ("TDRs") from such low-income housing and theaters; and

 WHEREAS, by Ordinance 117342 the City established a Development Rights Fund (redesignated as a subfund in Ordinance 117977) for the purchase of development rights from landmark performing arts theaters, in order to aid in their preservation; and

 WHEREAS, pursuant to Ordinances 117600, 117501, and 116366 the City acquired TDRs from the Paramount Theatre, the Eagles Building and certain low-income housing sites, respectively; and

 WHEREAS, the developer of a proposed hotel project has offered to purchase TDRs for use in accordance with the City's Land Use Code; the DHHS Director has negotiated the terms of sale; and the DHHS Director has recommended that the negotiated terms be accepted; and

 WHEREAS, there is an immediate need for additional funds for downtown low-income housing beyond the amounts appropriated in the 1996 Adopted Budget; Now, Therefore,

 BE IT ORDAINED BY THE CITY OF SEATTLE AS FOLLOWS:

 Section 1. The DHHS Director is authorized, for and on behalf of The City of Seattle, to execute, deliver, perform, administer, and enforce an agreement for the sale of One Hundred Thirty Thousand and Twelve (130,012) square feet of TDRs ("Agreement") and a related Use Agreement, each on substantially the terms set forth in Exhibit A to this Ordinance, each with such additional terms and conditions as the DHHS Director shall deem necessary or appropriate to carry out the intent of this Ordinance. The TDRs to be sold were acquired from the properties described on Exhibits B-1 through B-5 to this Ordinance. Upon performance by the purchaser in accordance with the terms of the Agreement, the DHHS Director is further authorized, for and on behalf of the City, to execute and deliver deeds to the TDRs sold, substantially in the forms of Exhibits B-1 through B-5 to this Ordinance, with such modifications as may be required by law.

 Section 2. The City Council finds that the non-financial consideration described in Exhibit A, including the rights to use of space in the hotel for events and the commitments to employment and training opportunities for low-income persons in connection with the hotel project, are in the public interest and will be of substantial benefit to the City.

 Section 3. The DHHS Director or her designee is hereby authorized, for and on behalf of the City, to negotiate, execute, deliver, record, accept, modify, perform and administer, as appropriate, any additional documents contemplated by the Agreement or the Use Agreement or that may be necessary or appropriate to implement the intent of the Agreement or this Ordinance.

 Section 4. Proceeds from the sale of TDRs shall be deposited first into Fund 164, Subfund 30, formerly denominated the "Housing Mitigation Account" of the Low-Income Housing Fund pursuant to Ordinance 115583, which is hereby renamed to be the "TDR/Mitigation Subfund", up to a total amount of EIGHT HUNDRED THIRTY-THREE THOUSAND SIXTY-FOUR AND NO/100 DOLLARS ($833,064.00). The balance of funds shall be deposited into the General Fund, Development Rights Subfund.

 Section 5. The amount of up to SEVEN HUNDRED FORTY-FIVE THOUSAND FOUR HUNDRED SIXTY-TWO AND NO/100 DOLLARS ($745,462.00), subject to the deposit thereof in the TDR/Mitigation Subfund pursuant to Section 4 of this Ordinance, is hereby appropriated from such Subfund for the development and preservation of low-income housing in downtown Seattle.

 Section 6. Any actions pursuant to the authority of this Ordinance and prior to its effective date are hereby ratified and confirmed.
