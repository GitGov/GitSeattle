 AN ORDINANCE creating a new agency, Seattle Public Utilities, by combining the functions of the Water Department with the solid waste, drainage and wastewater, engineering services, and related executive management functions of the Engineering Department, and the customer service call center and construction engineering functions of the City Light Department; and amending or repealing an array of Seattle Municipal Code sections to accomplish this reorganization and to abolish the former Water Department.

 WHEREAS, the City has undertaken a comprehensive review and reorganization of its utility and transportation functions to take effect in the 1997-1998 biennium; and

 WHEREAS, as a result of that review, it has been determined that the functions of the Water Department, the sewer, drainage, solid waste, and engineering service functions of the Engineering Department, and the customer service call center and construction engineering functions of the City Light Department would be better served by being consolidated in a new agency, the Seattle Public Utilities, Now Therefore,

 BE IT ORDAINED BY THE CITY OF SEATTLE AS FOLLOWS:

 I. ABOLITION OF THE WATER DEPARTMENT AND TRANSFER OF FUNCTIONS

 Section 1. Abolition of the Water Department and Transfer of Powers, Duties and Resources Related to Water Supply. Effective January 1, 1997, the Water Department is abolished. From and after that date all functions, responsibilities, agreements, obligations, authorizations, powers, equipment, records, appropriations, assets and liabilities of the Water Department shall be transferred to the newly created Seattle Public Utilities. The Director of Seattle Public Utilities is hereby authorized to perform all responsibilities, duties and obligations and exercise all powers related to water supply functions heretofore belonging to the Superintendent of Water.

 Section 2. Creation of Seattle Public Utilities. Effective January 1, 1997, there is created the Seattle Public Utilities based on the functions of the Water Department with the solid waste, drainage and wastewater, engineering services, and related executive management functions of the Engineering Department, and the customer service call center and construction engineering functions of the City Light Department.

 Section 3. Continuation of Authority. From and after January 1, 1997, all rules, regulations, notices and proceedings in effect with respect to the water supply functions of the former Water Department and with respect to the sewer, drainage, and solid waste functions of the former Engineering Department shall continue in effect unless and until they expire of their own terms or are superseded by order of the Director of Seattle Public Utilities or by ordinance.

 Section 4. Continuation of Separate Funds. The Seattle Public Utilities shall continue to maintain the Water Fund, the Drainage and Wastewater Fund the Solid Waste Fund and the Engineering Services Fund as separate funds and allocate expenditures and receipts to each of these funds respectively according to the nature of the functions performed.

 II. AMENDMENTS TO CODE SECTIONS

 A. PURPOSE

 Section 5. Purpose of Code Section Amendments. The purpose of amending the following array of Seattle Municipal Code sections is to accomplish the transfer of functions of the Water Department together with the solid waste, drainage and wastewater, engineering services, and related executive management functions of the Engineering Department, and the customer service call center and construction engineering functions of the City Light Department into a new agency, the Seattle Public Utilities, in addition to the transfer of functions by the general provisions of this ordinance. In doing so, it is inevitable that some specific sections which ought to have been amended will be overlooked. In such cases, therefore, any remaining references to the Water Department or the Superintendent of Water shall be interpreted to be references to the newly created Seattle Public Utilities and the Director of Seattle Public Utilities. Any remaining references to the solid waste, drainage and wastewater, engineering services, and related executive management functions of the Engineering Department or to the Director of Engineering in that regard shall likewise be interpreted to be references to the newly created Seattle Public Utilities and the Director of Seattle Public Utilities.

Upon full payment of the contract, the ~~Superintendent of Water~~Director of Seattle Public Utilities on behalf of the City shall execute and deliver to the property owner a release of such lien.

 Section 25. SMC 21.04.120 is hereby amended as follows:

 Special tap charge-Computation and payment.

 A. The special tap charge imposed by Section 21.04.110 hereof shall be paid into the water fund and shall be computed as follows: The number of units of property frontage determined in the manner prescribed in RCW 35.44.030 and 35.44.040 for determining "assessable units of frontage," shall be multiplied by the average local improvement assessment per unit of frontage for such facilities in Seattle for the year in which the water main to which the property is to be connected was constructed and accepted as completed, as set forth in C.F. 257032.

 B. The ~~Superintendent of Water~~Director of Seattle Public Utilities is authorized and directed to annually compute and establish the average local improvement assessment paid by property owners for water mains and hydrants completed and accepted by the City during the previous calendar year. If no water main and hydrant local improvement districts are completed and accepted or those completed and accepted are not representative of the average current costs of construction, the ~~Superintendent of Water~~Director of Seattle Public Utilities is hereby authorized to compute and establish an average water main and hydrant construction cost per assessable unit of frontage, using all water main and hydrant projects completed during the previous calendar year.

 This average assessment or average cost shall be used in computing the special tap charge imposed in Section 21.04.110 as to water main and hydrant improvements completed in each year. A copy of such computation shall be delivered to the City Clerk not later than April 30th of each such year to be filed by him or her in C.F. 257032.

 C. The special tap charge imposed by Section 21.04.110 and computed under Section 21.04.120 A and B shall be decreased for those properties with existing metered water service connections installed prior to December 31, 1984 and connected to abutting and certain non- abutting substandard water mains which are being replaced with mains of standard size, material and related appurtenances in accordance with standards and replacement criteria established by the ~~Superintendent~~Director pursuant to the Administrative Code (Chapter 3.02). Such decrease may also be applied to the special tap charges imposed upon properties connected to non-abutting substandard mains if the ~~Superintendent~~Director determines that there will be no future abutting water mains.

 D. Properties eligible for a decreased special tap charge under Section 21.04.120 C shall be charged a percentage of the full special tap charge, based upon the sizes of the existing substandard main and the new standard main, according to the following schedule.

 Existing Substandard Main Size Percent of Special Tap

 Charge to be Charged

 for Replacement New

 Mains

 8 inches 12 inches

 or smaller or larger

 new main new main

 size size

 2 inches and smaller, without 35% 70%

 hydrants

 3 inches through 6 inches, without 15% 50%

 hydrants

 8 inches, without hydrants 0% 40%

 4 inches through 8 inches, with 0% 40%

 hydrants

 Greater than 8 inches 0% 0%

 1. The percentages in the above schedule are based upon estimates of the differential between the cost of replacing the existing substandard water mains and appurtenances with facilities of the same original size and the cost of replacing them with the larger standard size facilities. The ~~Superintendent~~Director pursuant to the Administrative Code (Chapter 3.02) may change the above percentages. A copy of such changes shall be delivered to the City Clerk and filed by him or her in C.F. 257035.

 2. Properties eligible for and charged the decreased special tap charge under Section 21.04.120 C and D are subject to the payment requirements authorized in Section 21.04.110 B.

 E. The special tap charge imposed by Section 21.04.110 and computed under Section 21.04.120 may be decreased by the amount of a service line credit.

 Section 119. SMC 21.24.030 is hereby amended as follows:

 Special connection charge-Imposed.

 A. In addition to sewer connection permit fees required by ordinance, there is imposed upon, and the owners of properties which have not been assessed or charged or borne an equitable share of the cost of the City's sewerage system shall pay prior to connection to a City sewer, a special connection charge in an amount to be computed under Section 21.24.040.

 B. The special connection charge shall be paid in cash or under installment contract with interest thereon at a rate commensurate with the annual one (1) year rate for U.S. Treasury notes and bonds, adjusted for constant maturities, as published in the Federal Reserve Bulletin or otherwise available from the Federal Reserve Bank, for the year connection is made with the City sewer, computed annually on unpaid balances. Such contract shall provide for a down payment of five percent (5%) of the total connection charge, payable upon execution of such contract and for payment of the balance in forty (40) quarterly installments payable on each January 1st, April 1st, July 1st and October 1st. Such installment contract shall provide that any unpaid balance may be paid in full in any year at the time the first quarterly payment of such year is due and payable, shall describe the property served by the sewer, shall be acknowledged by the property owner and shall be recorded by the Director of ~~Engineering~~Seattle Public Utilities in the office of the King County Records and Elections Division at the expense of the property owner. Delinquent payments under such installment contract shall be a lien upon the described property as provided in RCW 35.67.200, enforceable in accordance with RCW 35.67.220 through 35.67.280; and as an additional and concurrent method of enforcing the lien, the water service to such property may be cut off in accordance with RCW 35.67.290 until the delinquent installments are paid. Upon full payment of the contract, the Director of ~~Engineering~~ Seattle Public Utilities on behalf of the City shall execute and deliver to the property owner a release of such lien.

 Section 120. SMC 21.24.040 is hereby amended as follows:

 Special connection charge-Computation.

 A. The special connection charge imposed by Section 21.24.030 shall be paid into the ~~Sewer~~Drainage and Wastewater Fund and, in order that property owners bear their equitable share of the cost of the sewer system, shall be computed as follows:

 1. For Lateral Sewers. The number of units of property frontage to be served by the sewer, determined in the manner prescribed in RCW 35.44.030 and 35.44.040 for determining "assessable units of frontage" or by such other method or combination of methods of computing assessments which may be deemed to more fairly reflect the special benefits to the property being assessed as authorized by RCW 35.44.047, shall be multiplied by the average local improvement assessment per unit of frontage for lateral sewers in Seattle for the year in which the sewer to which the property is to be connected was constructed and accepted as completed, provided that, for all sewers that are connected more than one (1) year after the City sewer was constructed, interest shall be added thereto at a rate commensurate with the annual one (1) year rate for U.S. Treasury notes and bonds, adjusted for constant maturities, as published in the Federal Reserve Bulletin or otherwise available from the Federal Reserve Bank, for the year the City sewer was or is completed and available for connection until the connection is made, but excluding both the year of completion of construction and the year connection is made; except that for connection to sewers constructed prior to 1953, interest shall be added thereto at the one (1) year rate for U.S. Treasury notes and bonds, adjusted for constant maturities, for the year 1953. Interest charged pursuant to this paragraph shall not exceed ten percent (10%) per year and shall not exceed ten (10) years.

 2. For Trunk Sewers. The number of square feet of property area to be served by the sewer shall be multiplied by the average local improvement assessment per square foot for trunk sewers in Seattle for the year in which the trunk sewer to which the lateral sewers serving the property are connected was constructed and accepted, provided that, for all sewers that are connected more than one (1) year after the City sewer was constructed, interest shall be added thereto at a rate commensurate with the annual one (1) year rate for U.S. Treasury notes and bonds, adjusted for constant maturities, as published in the Federal Reserve Bulletin or otherwise available from the Federal Reserve Bank, for the year the City sewer was or is completed and available for connection until the connection is made, but excluding both the year of completion of construction and the year connection is made, except that, for connection to sewers constructed prior to 1953, interest shall be added thereto at the one (1) year rate for U.S. Treasury notes and bonds, adjusted for constant maturities, for the year 1953. Interest charged pursuant to this paragraph shall not exceed ten percent (10%) per year and shall not exceed ten (10) years.

 B. The Director of ~~Engineering~~Seattle Public Utilities  is authorized to annually compute and establish the average local improvement assessment paid by property owners for lateral and trunk sewers completed and accepted by the City during the previous calendar year which average assessment shall be used by him or her in computing the special connection charge imposed in Section 21.24.030 as to sewer improvements completed in 1965 and thereafter. A copy of such computation shall be delivered to the City Clerk not later than February 1st of each such year to be filed by him in C.F. 253991.

 C. The Director shall file with the City Clerk in C.F. 253991 the annual one (1) year rate for U.S. Treasury notes and bonds, adjusted for constant maturities, as published in the Federal Reserve Bulletin, or otherwise available from the Federal Reserve Bank for each calendar year commencing with 1953. Such information shall be delivered to the City Clerk not later than April 1st for each preceding year.

 D. The collection of the special connection charge to serve a residence may be deferred at the request of a person responsible for its payment who is economically disadvantaged, as defined in Section 20.12.020 B of the Seattle Municipal Code and both owns and occupies the residence which will be connected to the City system. Interest on deferred charges shall be computed at the same rate as provided in subsection A of Section 21.24.030 as if payment were being made in a timely manner under an installment contract. A request for deferral must be made thirty (30) days prior to levy of the special connection charge. All charges, including interest, so deferred, shall become due and payable in full at the time of sale or transfer of the property.

 E. Such special connection charge for property abutting on a street in which a sewer can be constructed or extended to serve such property, shall be computed as if the sewer were so constructed or extended; and the special connection charge for property located back from the margin of the street in which the sewer exists and outside of the assessment district created therefor shall be made giving consideration to the distance of the property from the street margin. In no case shall credit be allowed for the cost of extra length of side sewer required for connection to the City's sewerage system; provided, that in cases where application of the foregoing formula to a particular property results in a charge which because of unusual conditions is in excess of charges to similar properties, the Director of ~~Engineering~~Seattle Public Utilities is authorized to reduce the special connection charge to the amount charged to properties similarly situated.

 F. For connection to side sewers constructed by the City, the property owner for whose benefit connection is made shall pay the cost of the side sewer. The cost shall be computed as follows: The actual cost to the City of the side sewer, plus fifteen percent (15%) for City design and administrative costs, plus interest at a rate commensurate with the annual one (1) year rate for U.S. Treasury notes and bonds, adjusted for constant maturities, as published in the Federal Reserve Bulletin or otherwise available from the Federal Reserve Bank, for the year the City sewer was or is completed and available for connection and applied until the connection is made, but excluding both the year of completion of construction and the year connection is made.

 Section 121. SMC 21.24.070 is hereby amended as follows:

 Fee payment.

 The fee shall be paid to the City Finance Director before the permit is issued and the amount of the fee paid shall be shown on the permit and on the record of the side sewer connection maintained in the office of the City Director of ~~Engineering~~Seattle Public Utilities.

Jan-Feb1414

Mar-April1515

May-Jun1814

July-Aug2214

Sept-Oct1614

 B. The Director of ~~Engineering~~Seattle Public Utilities  may use an assumed volume of six CCF per household, or prior water consumption records if those records are more representative of expected usage, to calculate residential wastewater charges under the following circumstances;

 1. When the water meter has been determined to be malfunctioning;

 2. When customers have insufficient water consumption history to calculate average winter water consumption;

 3. When water use in the period used to calculate average winter water consumption is not representative of expected water use, such as rental property that is vacant between tenants or in the case of seasonal customers; and

 4. When customers are not served by a publicly owned water supply system.

 Section 129. SMC 21.28.090 is hereby amended as follows:

 Calculation of commercial wastewater volume charge.

 A. It is the intent of this section to charge commercial customers for water that should enter the sewer system. Wastewater charges shall be based on the metered water delivered to the premises except as noted below:

 1. Water metered exclusively for fire service, sprinkling, irrigation or delivery of water to ships shall not be subject to any wastewater charge or rate.

 2. Where the use of water is such that a portion of all water used is lost by evaporation, irrigation, sprinkling or other cause, or is used in manufactured goods and commodities, customers may install, at their own expense, submeters approved by the Director of ~~Engineering~~Seattle Public Utilities to enable measurement of the amount of water so used or lost. These submeters must measure in CCF, must be calibrated on a regular basis, and must be easily accessible for meter reading. If the submeter is unable to be read or if the reading is unreliable, an estimate can be used, but the ~~Drainage and Wastewater Utility~~Seattle Public Utilities must get at least one (1) accurate meter reading per year. It will be the responsibility of the ~~Drainage and Wastewater Utility~~Seattle Public Utilities or its designee to inspect and approve the installation of a new submeter.

 Where it is impractical to install a meter as described above, customers may apply to the Director of ~~Engineering~~Seattle Public Utilities for an evaporation allowance or an irrigation allowance, provided that customer provide proof of the amount of water so used or lost. Evaporation loss allowances of eleven percent (11%) for industrial laundries and three percent (3%) for laundromats are established. Irrigation allowances shall apply from June 1st through September 30th and will be calculated based on the residential methodology in Section 21.30.80.

 B. Direct discharge of wastewater or industrial waste to salt or fresh water or to points other than the City sewer system shall not be cause for adjustment or reduction of the wastewater charge or rate.

 Section 130. SMC 21.28.100 is hereby amended as follows:

 Adjustments to wastewater volume charge.

 A. Upon receipt of satisfactory evidence of hidden or underground water leakage, the Director of ~~Engineering~~Seattle Public Utilities shall adjust the wastewater volume charge to the premises for water so lost and shall not use the period during which such leakage occurs in computing the average winter water consumption when to do so would result in a higher wastewater charge to such premises, provided that no such adjustment shall be made for leakage occurring more than four (4) months prior to the date of application therefor.

 B. Where wastewater service is provided to premises outside the City limits, the wastewater charge shall be computed on the same basis as premises located inside the City, except that a sum equal to thirty percent (30%) of the wastewater charge shall be added, with the exception of sewer districts, or portions thereof, outside the City limits which are now or may hereafter be covered by special agreements.

 C. Where wastewater service is provided to qualified low-income customers as defined in Section 21.76 of the Seattle Municipal Code, wastewater charges shall be partially offset in accordance with that chapter.

 Section 131. SMC 21.28.200 is hereby amended as follows:

 1. Except as provided in subsection D below, all discharges which are not composed entirely of stormwater are illicit discharges. See Section 22.808.020 for defenses available to responsible parties.

 2. The following is a partial list, provided for informational purposes only, of common substances which are illicit discharges when allowed to enter a public drainage control system: Solid waste; human and animal waste; antifreeze, oil, gasoline, grease and all other automotive and petroleum products; flammable or explosive materials; metals in excess of naturally occurring amounts, whether in liquid or solid form; chemicals not normally found in uncontaminated water; solvents and degreasers; painting products; drain cleaners; commercial and household cleaning materials; pesticides; herbicides; fertilizers; acids; alkalis; ink; steam- cleaning waste; laundry waste; soap; detergent; ammonia; chlorine; chlorinated swimming pool or hot tub water; domestic or sanitary sewage; animal carcasses; food and food waste; yard waste; dirt; sand; and gravel.

 D. Permissible Discharges. Discharges from the sources listed below shall only be illicit discharges if the Director of ~~Engineering~~Seattle Public Utilities determines that the type of discharge, whether singly or in combination with others, is causing or contributing to a violation of the City's NPDES stormwater permit or is causing or contributing to a water quality problem, such as those which contain more contamination than typical discharges in the City, or which contain a type of contamination that is more toxic or is otherwise a more serious problem than typical discharges in the City: Potable water sources; washing of potable water storage reservoirs; flushing of potable water lines; natural uncontaminated surface water; natural uncontaminated groundwater; air-conditioning condensation; natural springs; uncontaminated water from crawl space pumps; runoff from lawn watering; irrigation runoff; runoff from residential car washing by individuals; flows from riparian habitats and wetlands; heat; discharges in compliance with an NPDES permit; and discharges from approved footing drains and other subsurface drains or, where approval is not required, installed in compliance with this subtitle and rules promulgated pursuant to this subtitle.

 E. Exemption. Discharges resulting from public firefighting activities, but not from activities not related to firefighting such as the maintenance or cleaning of firefighting equipment, are exempt from regulation under this section.

 F. Testing for Illicit Discharges. When the Director of ~~Engineering~~Seattle Public Utilities has reason to believe that any discharge is an illicit discharge, the Director of ~~Engineering~~Seattle Public Utilities may sample and analyze the discharge and recover the costs from a responsible party in an enforcement proceeding. When the discharge is likely to contain illicit discharges on a recurring basis, the Director of ~~Engineering~~Seattle Public Utilities may conduct, or may require the responsible party to conduct, ongoing monitoring at the responsible party's expense.

 Section 178. SMC 22.802.013 is hereby amended as follows:

 Requirements for existing discharges and land uses.

 A. General.

 1. For all existing discharges directly or indirectly to a public drainage control system, responsible parties shall implement and maintain nonstructural best management practices as specified in rules promulgated jointly by the Director of ~~Engineering~~ Seattle Public Utilities and the Director of Construction and Land Use. "Nonstructural best management practices" shall include, but not be limited to, maintenance and housekeeping practices such as cleaning of catchbasins and detention facilities, sweeping of parking lots, storing oil barrels and other contaminant sources out of the rain, covering material stockpiles, and proper use and storage of hazardous materials.

 2.

Approval shall be obtained prior to initiating land-disturbing activities or new development or redevelopment. Approvals must be obtained for exceptions to any and all requirements of this subtitle, including but not limited to the requirement that natural drainage patterns be maintained and the requirement that watercourses not be obstructed.

 B. Thresholds for Drainage Control Review. The City may, by interagency agreement signed by both the Director of ~~Engineering~~Seattle Public Utilities and the Director of Construction and Land Use, waive the drainage and erosion control permit and document requirements for property owned by public entities, when discharges from the property do not enter the public drainage control system or the public combined sewer system. Whether or not they are required to obtain permits or submit documents, public entities are subject to the substantive requirements of this subtitle, unless exceptions are granted as set forth in Section 22.808.010. Except as provided in this subsection, drainage control review and approval shall be required as provided below:

 1. Where an application for either a master use permit or building permit includes the cumulative addition of seven hundred fifty (750) square feet or more of developmental coverage after the effective date of the ordinance codified in this subtitle;

 2. Where an application for a grading permit or approval is required;

 3. Where a street use permit is required and the permit is for the cumulative addition of seven hundred fifty (750) square feet or more of developmental coverage after the effective date of the ordinance codified in this subtitle;

 4. Where a City public works project or construction contract, including contracts for day labor and other public works purchasing agreements, is for the cumulative addition of seven hundred fifty (750) square feet or more of developmental coverage to the site after the effective date of the ordinance codified in this subtitle, except for projects in a City-owned right-of-way and except for work performed for the operation and maintenance of park lands under the control or jurisdiction of the Department of Parks and Recreation;

 5. Where any permit approval or contract includes any new or additional developmental coverage on a site deemed a potentially hazardous location, as specified in Section 22.800.050 ;

 6. Whenever an exception to a requirement set forth in this subtitle or in a rule promulgated under this subtitle is desired, whether or not review and approval would otherwise be required, including but not limited to alteration of natural drainage patterns or the obstruction of watercourses.

 C. Minimum Requirements for All Projects. All projects must comply with the requirements of this subsection. Projects with more than nine thousand (9,000) square feet of developmental coverage shall also comply with the requirements of subsection D below. The Director of Construction and Land Use may also require projects with nine thousand (9,000) square feet or less of developmental coverage to comply with the requirements set forth in subsection D when necessary to accomplish the purposes of this subtitle. In making this determination, the Director of Construction and Land Use may consider, but not be limited to, the following attributes of the site: location within an environmentally critical area; proximity and tributary to an environmentally critical area; proximity and tributary to an area with known erosion or flooding problems.

 1. Discharge Point. The discharge point for drainage water from each site shall be selected as set forth in rules promulgated jointly by the Director of ~~Engineering~~Seattle Public Utilities and the Director of Construction and Land Use specifying criteria, guidelines and standards for determining drainage discharge points to meet the purposes of this subtitle.

 Enforcement of notice of violation.

 A. Hearing Examiner and Municipal Court. The Director of ~~Engineering~~Seattle Public Utilities or the Director of Construction and Land Use or both of them may choose to enforce a Notice of Violation through either of the following means:

 1. An enforcement hearing through the Hearing Examiner's Office, as set forth in this section; or

 2. Referral to the City Attorney's Office for action in the appropriate court according to that court's normal rules and procedures.

 B. Enforcement Through Hearing Examiner's Office. Enforcement actions through the Office of the Hearing Examiner shall proceed according to this subsection.

 1. Hearing Schedule. The Hearing Examiner's Office shall schedule a hearing after notification by the Director that enforcement will be pursued through the Hearing Examiner's Office.

 2. Conduct of the Hearing. The Hearing Examiner shall conduct a hearing on the violation pursuant to the rules of procedure of the Hearing Examiner, as modified by this section. The Director, the person to whom the notice of violation was issued, and any other responsible party regarding the matters addressed in the notice of violation may participate as parties in the hearing, with or without representation by an attorney. Each party may call and compel the attendance of witnesses.

 3. Standard of Review and Burden of Proof.

The Hearing Examiner shall issue an order within fifteen (15) days following the close of the record unless all parties agree to an extension of time. The order shall contain the following information:

 a. The decision regarding the alleged violation;

 b. Findings of fact and conclusions based thereon in support of the decision;

 c. The required corrective action (if any);

 d. The date and time by which the corrective action must be completed;

 e. The monetary penalties and other costs, expenses, or damages being assessed against the responsible party;

 f. Notice that the responsible party has twenty-one (21) days from the date of issuance of the decision to petition for judicial review, as provided by Section 705 of Chapter 347 of the Laws of 1995; and

 g. Authorization for the City to abate or correct the violation following expiration of the appeal period and the time set for compliance with the order if the responsible party has not completed the required corrective action, and to charge the responsible party for its costs, as set forth in Section 22.808.080 . The order shall not require the City to abate or correct the violation.

 5. Failure to Appear. If the responsible party to whom the notice of violation was issued fails to appear at a scheduled hearing before the Hearing Examiner, and no other responsible party appears to defend, then, upon an offer of proof by the City, which may be made by declaration, the Hearing Examiner shall issue an order finding that the violation occurred. The order shall contain the information set forth in subsection B4 above. In the absence of an offer of proof by the City, the Hearing Examiner shall issue an order finding the responsible party to be in default, and setting forth the penalties and other relief described in subsection B4.

 Section 187. SMC 22.808.050 is hereby amended as follows:

 Voluntary compliance agreement.

 A. Initiation. Either a responsible party or the Director of ~~Engineering~~Seattle Public Utilities or the Director of Construction and Land Use may initiate negotiations for a voluntary compliance agreement at any time. Neither Director has any obligation to enter into any voluntary compliance agreement.

 B. Contents. A voluntary compliance agreement shall set forth actions to be taken by the responsible party that will correct past or existing violations of this subtitle. It may also set forth actions to mitigate the impacts of violations. The voluntary compliance agreement shall set forth a schedule for completion of the corrective and mitigating actions. It shall contain a provision allowing the Director of ~~Engineering~~Seattle Public Utilities and the Director of Construction and Land Use to inspect the premises to determine compliance with the agreement.

 C. Effect of Agreement.

 1. A voluntary compliance agreement is a binding contract between the party executing it and the City. It is not enforceable by any other party. All voluntary compliance agreements shall provide that the responsible party agrees the City may perform the actions set forth in the agreement if the responsible party fails to do so according to the terms and schedule of the agreement, and the responsible party will pay the costs, expenses and damages the City incurs in performing the actions, as set forth in Section 22.808.080 regarding abatements. By entering into a voluntary compliance agreement, a responsible party waives the right to an administrative appeal of the violation.

 2. Penalties may be reduced or waived if violations are corrected or mitigated according to the terms and schedule of a voluntary compliance agreement. If the responsible party fails to perform according to the terms and schedule of the voluntary compliance agreement, penalties for each violation addressed in the agreement may be assessed starting from the date the violation occurred.

 D. Modification. The terms and schedule of the voluntary compliance agreement may be modified by mutual agreement of the responsible party and either Director if circumstances or conditions outside the responsible party's control, or unknown at the time the agreement was made, or other just cause necessitate such modifications.

 Section 188. SMC 22.808.070 is hereby amended as follows:

 Collection of costs and penalties.

 A. Invoice and Demand for Payment. When either Director has abated a public nuisance or corrected a violation of this subtitle and a hearing has not been conducted, the Director shall issue an invoice and demand for payment of the City's abatement costs. The invoice shall include:

 1. The amount of the City's abatement or correction costs;

 2. Either a legal description of the property corresponding as nearly as possible to that used for the property on the rolls of the King County Assessor or, where available, the property's street address;

 3. A notice that the Director's determinations regarding the abatement and correction, including the amount owed, may be appealed to the Hearing Examiner by following the procedure set forth in SMC Section 23.76.022;

 4. Notice that if the amount due is not paid within thirty (30) days, the outstanding balance may be collected in any of the manners set forth in subsection B of this section; and

 5. Notice that interest shall accrue on the unpaid balance.

 B. Collection Following a Hearing. The Director of Construction and Land Use and the Director of ~~Engineering~~Seattle Public Utilities are not required to issue an invoice for payment when a hearing has been conducted as set forth in Section 22.808.040, and an order has issued imposing any penalties, costs, damages, expenses or abatement costs. If the order is not appealed within fifteen (15) days of mailing or other delivery of the order to the responsible party, the Director of Construction and Land Use or the Director of ~~Engineering~~Seattle Public Utilities may immediately seek to collect the amounts owed by:

 1. Referral to the City Attorney's Office for action in the appropriate court; or

 2. Referral, after consultation with the City Attorney's Office to a collection agency; or

 3. Addition of a surcharge in the amount owed under the order to the ~~Drainage and Wastewater Utility~~ bill for drainage and wastewater services to the site. If unpaid, the surcharge may become a lien on the property, may be foreclosed, and may accrue interest as provided by state law or SMC Section 21.33.110.

 Section 189. SMC 22.808.080 is hereby amended as follows:

 Public nuisance.

 A. Abatement Required. A public nuisance affecting stormwater, drainage, erosion control, grading and other public nuisances set forth in this section are violations of this subtitle. A responsible party shall immediately abate a public nuisance upon becoming aware of its existence.

 B. Dysfunctional Facility or Practice. Any private drainage control facility or best management practice relating to grading, stormwater, drainage control or erosion not installed or maintained as required by this subtitle, or otherwise found to be in a state of dysfunction creating, presently or in the event of a design storm, a threat to the public health, safety or welfare, the environment, or public or private property is hereby declared to be a public nuisance.

 C. Obstruction of Watercourse. Obstruction of a watercourse without authorization by the Director, and obstruction in such a manner as to increase the risk of flooding or erosion should a design storm occur, is hereby declared to be a public nuisance.

 D. Dangerous Conditions. Any condition relating to grading, stormwater, drainage or erosion which creates a present or imminent danger, or which is likely to create a danger, in the event of a design storm, to the public health, safety or welfare, the environment, or public or private property is hereby declared to be a public nuisance.

 E. Abatement by the City. The Director of ~~Engineering~~ Seattle Public Utilities and the Director of Construction and Land Use are authorized, but not required, to investigate a condition that either Director suspects of being a public nuisance under this subtitle, and to abate any public nuisance.

 D. Where no definite method is prescribed in the chapter for calculating the amount of fees, the Director may assess charges as required to cover expenses.

 E. The Director shall have full authority to specify the terms and conditions upon which services and materials shall be made available, and the fees as determined by the Director shall be consistent with the reasonable estimated cost to the City for furnishing such services or materials.

 F. The total fee assessed for any permit, decision or approval shall be rounded to the nearest whole dollar (rounded down: One Cent ($.01) through Fifty Cents ($.50); rounded up: Fifty-one Cents ($.51) through Ninety-nine Cents ($.99.

 Section 193. SMC 25.06.050 is hereby amended as follows:

 Identification of areas of special flood hazard.

 Areas of special flood hazard in The City of Seattle are identified by the Federal Insurance Administration in a scientific and engineering preliminary report entitled "The Flood Insurance Study for King County, Washington and Incorporated Areas," dated September 23, 1988, with accompanying Flood Insurance Rate Maps. The study and maps are filed in C.F. 296948 and are hereby adopted by reference and declared to be a part of this chapter. The study and maps shall be maintained on file at the Department of Construction and Land Use and the Seattle ~~Engineering Department~~Public Utilities and may be maintained on file at the Seattle Park Department, the Seattle- King County Department of Public Health, and other City offices.

 Section 194. SMC 25.06.110 is hereby amended as follows:

 Standards involving base flood elevations.

 In all areas of special flood hazards where base flood elevation data has been provided under Section 25.06.050 or subsection C of Section 25.06.090, the following are required:

 A. Residential Construction.

 1. New construction and substantial improvement of any residential structure shall have the lowest floor, including basement, elevated to two feet (2') or more above base flood elevation, or as otherwise approved by the Director of the Department of Construction and Land Use in consultation with the Director of ~~Engineering~~ Seattle Public Utilities .

 2. Fully enclosed areas below the lowest floor that are subject to flooding are prohibited, or shall be designed to automatically equalize hydrostatic flood forces on exterior walls by allowing for the entry and exit of floodwaters. Designs for meeting this requirement must either be certified by a registered professional civil engineer or architect or must meet or exceed the following minimum criteria:

 a. A minimum of two (2) openings having a total net area of not less than one (1) square inch for every square foot of enclosed area subject to flooding shall be provided;

 b. The bottom of all openings shall be no higher than one foot (1') above grade;

 c. Openings may be equipped with screens, louvers or other coverings or devices provided that they permit the automatic entry and exit of floodwaters.

 B. Nonresidential Construction. New construction and substantial improvement of any commercial, industrial or other nonresidential structure shall either have the lowest floor, including basement, elevated to two feet (2') or more above the level of the base flood elevation, or as otherwise approved by the Director of the Department of Construction and Land Use in consultation with the Director of ~~Engineering~~Seattle Public Utilities ; or, together with attendant utility and sanitary facilities, shall:

 1. Be floodproofed so that below two feet (2') above the base flood level the structure is watertight with walls substantially impermeable to the passage of water;

 2. Have structural components capable of resisting hydrostatic and hydrodynamic loads and effects of buoyancy;

 3. Be certified by a registered professional civil engineer that the design and methods of construction are in accordance with accepted standards of practice for meeting provisions of this subsection based on their development and/or review of the structural design, specifications and plans. Such certifications shall be provided as set forth in subsection C of Section 25.06.070.

 Nonresidential structures that are elevated, not floodproofed, must meet the same standards for space below the lowest floor as described in subsection A2 above. Applicants floodproofing nonresidential buildings shall be notified that flood insurance premiums will be based on rates that are one foot (1') below the floodproofed level (e.g., a building floodproofed to one foot (1') above the base flood level will be rated as at the base flood level).

 C. Critical Facilities. Construction of new critical facilities shall be located outside the limits of the areas of special flood hazard where possible. Construction of new critical facilities shall be permissible within areas of special flood hazard if no feasible alternative site is available. Critical facilities constructed within areas of special flood hazard shall have the lowest floor elevated to three feet (3') above the level of the base flood elevation at the site. Floodproofing and sealing measures must be taken to ensure that toxic substances will not be displaced by or released into floodwaters. Access routes to all critical facilities shall be elevated to or above the level of the base flood elevation to the extent possible.

 D. Manufactured Homes. All manufactured homes to be placed or substantially improved within Zones A1-30, AH, and AE on the FIRM shall be elevated on a permanent foundation so that the lowest floor of the manufactured home is two feet (2') or more above the base flood elevation, or as otherwise approved by the Director of the Department of Construction and Land Use in consultation with the Director of ~~Engineering~~Seattle Public Utilities ; and shall be securely anchored to an adequately anchored foundation system in accordance with the provisions of Section 25.06.100 A. This subsection applies to manufactured homes to be placed or substantially improved in an expansion to an existing manufactured home park or subdivision.

 Section 195. SMC 25.09.120 is hereby amended as follows:

 Development standards for flood-prone areas.

 A. No development shall be permitted within the "floodway" of flood-prone areas. Permitted development within flood-prone areas lying outside the floodway shall not contribute to increased downstream flow of floodwaters and shall comply with the provisions of SMC Chapter 25.06, Seattle Floodplain Development Ordinance (FEMA). A drainage-control plan shall be required for all proposed development.

 B. Drainage-Control Plan. If the site is mapped or determined to be flood-prone, a drainage-control plan shall be submitted with the permit application showing the flood-prone area, the tributary watershed, and all drainage features, to describe the existing situation and proposed modifications to the drainage system. The drainage-control plan shall provide for control of water quality and quantity in compliance with the SMC Title 22, Subtitle VIII, Grading and Drainage Control Ordinance, SMC Chapter 25.06, Seattle Floodplain Development Ordinance, and any other subsequent applicable flood- control codes or ordinances to protect the public interest and prevent harm.

 C. Elevation Above Base Flood Level. The lowest floor elevation of any structure located in a flood-prone area shall be two feet (2') above the one-hundred (100) year flood elevation unless otherwise specified by the Director of ~~Engineering~~Seattle Public Utilities.
