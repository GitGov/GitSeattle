The expenditure allowance in the 1996 Budget of the Department of Housing and Human Services, Support Fund Appropriation, Low Income Housing - HOME Program (Fund 16490) is hereby increased by the amount of Ninety- Three Thousand Dollars ($93,000), which amount represents the excess of the total 1996 HOME grant over the amount of 1996 HOME funds appropriated in the 1996 Budget. Of this amount, Nine Thousand Three Hundred Dollars ($9,300) shall be expended through the Department of Housing and Human Services Operating Fund (Fund 16200), and the expenditure allowance in such fund in the 1996 Adopted Budget, Program Category Housing and Community Services (Code H1300), is therefore increased by Nine Thousand Three Hundred Dollars ($9,300), which represents the administration portion of the additional 1996 HOME grant funds appropriated in this Section.
