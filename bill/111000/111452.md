 (b) The 1997 recommendations of the Budget Committee of the City Council, as set forth in C.F. _________ and adopted by the City Council on ________________, 1996.

 In case of conflicting modifications, the one of later date shall control.

 Section 2. The officers and employee positions designated in the 1997 Position List filed as C.F. ___________, with modifications: (a) by the Mayor in C.F. ________ and (b) by the City Council as stated above in Section 1, are hereby established in the various departments or agencies shown, including such abrogations and reductions during the 1997 budget year as are indicated therein. In case of conflicting modifications, the one of later date shall control. This designation of positions supersedes the previous designation of positions in the 1996 adopted budget. The administrative or organizational structure of the various City departments or agencies shown in the 1997 Annual Budget shall, for 1997, supersede any existing or inconsistent organization established in previous budgets for such department or agency.

 Section 3. (a) The amounts, or so much thereof as may be necessary, shown as appropriations for 1997 for the various capital projects or for the various capital improvement program categories in the Annual Budget, are hereby appropriated from the respective funds identified for carrying out the capital improvement program category or the capital improvement project named to be carried out by the designated City department, subject to and consistent with applicable provisions of the State Constitution and laws and the City Charter and ordinances of The City of Seattle, substantially as described in the approved 1997-2002 Capital Improvement Program. The appropriation of money for a CIP category or project constitutes authority for the designated City department, commission or office, as appropriate and after compliance with the State Environmental Policy Act, to acquire personal property, obtain options to acquire real property, negotiate to acquire right-of-way and other real property interests, prepare plans and designs, demolish, construct, and make improvements, and obtain any ancillary services, including, without limitation, planning, engineering, design, appraisal, escrow, title insurance, construction inspection, environmental audits and remediation appraisals or other reviews. Each department may obtain the authorized services or property using City staff or by contract as authorized in Section 5 below. Where projects or programs are identified in the CIP as to be carried out by other entities wholly or in part with City funds, the appropriation constitutes authority to provide such funds to such other entities for such purposes, subject to applicable laws and ordinances.

 (b) Moneys appropriated from funds, subfunds, accounts, and subaccounts in which are deposited the proceeds derived from the issuance of bonded obligations, shall be expended only in accordance with the terms, conditions, and restrictions of ordinances authorizing such obligations and establishing the respective funds.

 (c) Moneys appropriated from funds, subfunds, accounts, and subaccounts in which are deposited the proceeds of grants, financial assistance from the State of Washington or other governmental agencies, or gifts, bequests or devises to the City for specific purposes shall be expended only in accordance with applicable terms, conditions, restrictions and City ordinances.

 (d) The funds so appropriated shall be subject to transfer for use with other projects as provided in SMC Chapter 5.08 (Ordinance 100895) (for operating budgets) or as provided in Section 6 below (for CIP projects and capital program categories).

 (e) The 1997-2002 Capital Improvement Program is part of the adopted budget and identifies, among other projects, those capital projects funded wholly or in part from the proceeds of the taxes authorized in RCW 82.46.010 and/or RCW 82.46.035, and/or from the proceeds of bonds, for the repayment of which tax revenues under RCW 82.46.010 have been pledged. Such taxes are intended to be in addition to other funds that may be reasonably available for such capital projects.

 (f) The portions of the 1997-2002 Capital Improvement Program pertaining to the City Light Department and the Seattle Public Utilities Department, as those portions of the CIP may be amended from time to time, are adopted as systems or plans of additions to and betterments and extensions of the facilities, physical plants, or systems of the City Light Department and the Seattle Public Utilities Department, respectively.

 (g) The City Finance Director is authorized to draw and pay the necessary warrants and to make any necessary transfers among funds and accounts.

 Section 5. The Transportation Director, the Superintendent of Parks, the Arts Commission Director, the Office of Management and Planning Director, the Superintendent of City Light, the Superintendent of Seattle Public Utilities, the City Librarian, and the Seattle Center Director are authorized to negotiate for and enter into contracts, within their appropriation authority, to obtain property and services authorized in Section 3 to carry out those capital projects included in the 1997-2002 Capital Improvement Program and assigned to their respective departments, commissions or offices.

 Section 6. The Mayor, in consultation with the Budget Director, is authorized to transfer up to ten percent (10%) of an appropriation for a particular capital improvement project or capital program category authorized in Section 1 or Twenty-five Thousand Dollars ($25,000), whichever is greater, to another capital project or capital program category authorized in Section 1 and to be carried out by the same department, provided:
