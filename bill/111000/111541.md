 This Uniform Fire Code together with the City of Seattle amendments thereto, as adopted under separate ordinances and known as the Seattle Fire Code Supplement, shall constitute the Official Seattle Fire Code.

 4. Remaining underground piping shall be capped or plugged, and

 5. A record of the tank size, location and date of abandonment shall be retained.
