 AN ORDINANCE relating to Seattle Public Utilities; and authorizing the sale of up to 5.5 million board feet of second-growth timber on certain City-owned property in Ferry County, Washington, for the purpose of further developing the Cedar River Watershed Habitat Conservation Plan

 WHEREAS, the City has reached Agreement in Principle with various Federal and State agencies on major terms of a Habitat Conservation Plan (HCP) for the Cedar River Watershed which would establish the City's long term commitments regarding watershed habitat protection and restoration and mitigation for certain adverse impacts resulting from the presence and operation of certain City owned facilities, all in exchange for certain releases and settlement of various water resource management issues with the other parties; and

 WHEREAS, the City and other parties intend to prepare during 1997 an Instream Flow Agreement, a Mitigation Agreement for the fish blockage posed by the City's Landsburg Diversion Dam, and an HCP Implementation Agreement, all consistent with the terms and concepts contained in the Agreement in Principle, and

 WHEREAS, the City further intends to prepare during 1997 the HCP itself and the environmental documents relating to it, and to conduct public workshops and presentations on the content of the HCP, all prior to final City decisions and submittal of the HCP to the US Fish and Wildlife Service; and

 WHEREAS, the 1997 Budget of Seattle Public Utilities and 1997-1998 Water CIP did not provide for direct expenditures in 1997 to complete the HCP, and instead deferred consideration of such action until the outcome of negotiations over the terms of the HCP became clearer; and

 WHEREAS, the adopted 1997-1998 water rates likewise provide no direct funding for the HCP, and instead were premised on the assumption that HCP expenditures during this period would be matched by revenue from the sale of second growth timber and surplus land; and

 WHEREAS, estimated 1997 expenditures for the HCP (including timber sale costs) can be accommodated by administrative transfer of appropriation authority from the Water Supply Program Category to the Projects in Development Program Category, both in the 1997 Water CIP, provided that sufficient additional non-rate revenue becomes available to cover that amount; and

 WHEREAS, commercial thinning harvest of certain second-growth timber on the City's surplus property in Ferry County during 1997 and 1998 would provide additional non-rate revenue in excess of 1997 HCP costs; and

 WHEREAS, following public hearing held by the Utilities and Environmental Management Committee in 1993, it was determined that the subject property is surplus to the City's needs and not required for water utility service; NOW, THEREFORE,

 BE IT ORDAINED BY THE CITY OF SEATTLE AS FOLLOWS:

 Section 1. The Director of Seattle Public Utilities is hereby authorized to enter into and execute, on behalf of the City, timber sale agreements with successful bidders, as established by a public auction, for up to 5.5 million board feet of second-growth timber from City-owned lands located within Section 5, Township 37 North, Range 32 East, and within Sections 19, 20, 21, 27, 28, 29, 30, 32, 33, and 34, Township 38 North, Range 32 East, all in Ferry County, Washington. The Director of Seattle Public Utilities is further authorized and directed for and on behalf of the City to execute and deliver to the purchasers the rights to harvest and remove all standing and down second-growth timber as designated within areas on the ground by representatives of Seattle Public Utilities pursuant to this section, except for those trees, snags and logs specified or marked by representatives of Seattle Public Utilities, and subject to approval by the Washington State Department of Natural Resources.
