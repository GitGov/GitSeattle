~~D. Application or Permit Cancellation. For any application or permit cancelled by the Department, the fee for services shall be calculated at the time of the cancellation. If additional fees are due from the applicant, an invoice for the amount due will be sent to permit applicant or owner consistent with the City's collection procedure. If a refund is due to the applicant, a refund check for the balance due the applicant will be sent to the permit applicant or owner.~~

C. Remaining Fee Balances. At the time an application or permit is cancelled, the final fee shall be determined. If a balance is due to the Department, it shall be collected from the applicant or owner unless waived according to rules promulgated by the Director.

 Section 9. As of January 1, 1997 Section 22.901C.010 of the Seattle Municipal Code, which Section was last amended by Ordinance 117908, is amended as follows:

 22.901C.010 Development permit fees.

 A. General. The development fee shall cover the application, review and inspection process associated with new construction, additions, alterations, and repairs to existing buildings and establishment of use. The development fee shall consist of a permit fee and, where plans are routed for review, a separate plan review fee. The permit fee and plan review fee shall be determined based on valuation, except as provided below.

 1. Determination of Value.

 a. The Director shall determine the value of construction for which the permit is issued (the estimated current value of all labor and materials, whether actually paid or not, as well as all finish work, painting, roofing, electrical, plumbing, heating, air-conditioning, elevators, fire-extinguishing systems, automatic sprinkler systems, other mechanical systems, retaining walls, rockeries and any other permanent work or permanent equipment, but not including furnishings). The building valuation data from the International Conference of Building Officials (ICBO) as published in "Building Standards" and other valuation criteria approved by the Director will be used to determine the value of construction.

 b. The gross area, used in conjunction with the ICBO building valuation and other data to determine the valuation of a building project, shall mean the total area of all floors, measured from the exterior face, outside dimensions or exterior column line of a building, including basements, cellars and balconies, but not including unexcavated areas. Where walls and columns are omitted in the construction of a building, such as an open shed or marquee, the exterior wall of the open side or sides, for purposes of calculating gross area, shall be the edge of the roof, including gutters.

 c. The valuation for uncovered structures such as roof parking areas, plazas, piers, platforms, commercial decks and similar uncovered usable structures shall be computed on one-half (through) the gross area.

 d. Dish or Panel Antennae. The fee for processing applications for installation of a dish or panel antenna shall be charged on the value of the foundation and supports constructed for the installation. The value of the dish or panel antenna shall not be included in the determination of value.

 e. The Director shall establish standard factors to adjust for the increased development costs of complying with the requirements of the Critical Areas Ordinance.

 f. The valuation shall be based on the highest type of construction to which a proposed structure most nearly conforms, as determined by the Director.

 2. Calculation of Development Fees. The development fee for a permit shall be calculated as described herein: Table 3 shall establish the Development Fee Index for value-based development fees. Except as specified in subparagraph 3 below, Table 4 establishes the permit fee and plan review fee, calculated as a percentage of the Development Fee Index where determined by value. If two (2) or more buildings are allowed under one (1) permit, they shall be assessed fees as separate buildings under Table 4. The individual fees shall then be added to determine the total development fee for the permit.
