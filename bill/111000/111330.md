 AN ORDINANCE relating to the City Light Department; authorizing the Superintendent of City Light to negotiate for and purchase parcels of land to be set aside as wildlife preserves in accordance with the federal license for the Skagit River Hydroelectric Project.

 WHEREAS, pursuant to Resolution 28349, City Light entered into the Wildlife Settlement Agreement, incorporating the Wildlife Habitat Protection and Management Plan, (collectively, "Wildlife Agreement"), dated April 1991, with the Washington Department of Wildlife (now, Washington Department of Fish and Wildlife); U.S. Department of the Interior, National Park Service, U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service and Bureau of Indian Affairs; U.S. Department of Agriculture, U.S. Forest Service; Upper Skagit Tribe; Sauk- Suiattle Tribe; Swinomish Indian Tribal Community; and the North Cascades Conservation Council (collectively, the "Intervenors"); and

 WHEREAS, the parties entered into the Wildlife Agreement in order to satisfy the concerns of the Intervenors regarding the operation of the Skagit River Hydroelectric Project and its impacts on wildlife resources under a new license for the project, which the City had applied for in 1977; and

 WHEREAS, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission's license for the Skagit River Hydroelectric Project, as stated in the Order on Rehearing dated June 26, 1996, incorporated the terms of the Wildlife Agreement as conditions of operating the hydroelectric project for the term of the new license; and

 WHEREAS, the Wildlife Agreement outlines a land acquisition program that sets forth principles and procedures for selecting land to be acquired, an initial list of specific properties to be acquired and an initial list of substitute properties, and also creates a "land acquisition group" made up of representatives of the City and the Intervenors that has responsibility for land selection decisions; and

 WHEREAS, the pattern of land ownership along the Skagit River is characterized by many small tracts of land owned by numerous parties, rather than large tracts of land under the ownership of one party; and

 WHEREAS, given this pattern of land ownership, the City will be obliged to make many small land purchases in order to meet the provisions of the Wildlife Agreement; and

 WHEREAS, there is an efficiency to be gained in a single authorization of all remaining land purchases pursuant to the land acquisition program; and

 WHEREAS, the amount to be spent for the land acquisition and management program has already been established in the Wildlife Agreement and is not to exceed Seventeen Million Dollars ($17,000,000) (1990$) total; and

 WHEREAS, approximately 75% of the Seventeen Million Dollars ($17,000,000) (1990$) already has been spent to acquire wildlife property; Now, Therefore,

 BE IT ORDAINED BY THE CITY OF SEATTLE AS FOLLOWS:

 Section 1. The Superintendent of City Light is hereby authorized, within and subject to appropriation authority, to negotiate for and purchase parcels of land pursuant to the budget and selection criteria established in the Wildlife Agreement, a copy of which is on file in the Clerk's Office as CF . City Light shall provide quarterly reports to the City Council on all actions taken pursuant to the authority of this ordinance, via the Superintendent at his regular meetings with the Chair of the Utilities and Environmental Management Committee.

 Section 2. As soon as practicable after closing on any property acquired pursuant to the authority of this ordinance, City Light shall submit to the City Council a deed acceptance ordinance.

 Section 3. Any act, including but not limited to appraisal of property under consideration for purchase, pursuant to the authority and prior to the effective date of this ordinance is hereby ratified and confirmed.
