Receipt of grant funds is contingent upon the dollar value of loans provided for minority and women-owned businesses.

 Section 2. The sum of up to Two Hundred and One Thousand Dollars ($201,000) is hereby appropriated from the Cumulative Reserve Fund - Capital Projects Sub Fund - Unrestricted Account (Other), for the following capital project of the Department of Parks and Recreation which has already been approved for funding, such appropriation being subject to the receipt of and to be supported by, moneys accepted in Section 1 of this Ordinance.

 CIP No. K72861 Parks Upgrade Team CDBG Project SFMS No. K302CF96

 Nothing in this Section is intended to authorize greater total expenditures on such project than authorized in the City's Capital Improvement Program ("CIP"). Therefore, pursuant to Section 4 below, the amount of CDBG funding for such project as set forth in the CIP shall be reduced by the amount of funds allocated to such project under this Section.

 Section 3. The Mayor or Director of Housing and Human Services is hereby authorized to amend the 1996 Consolidated Plan's Action Plan to reprogram to the activity within the Economic Development Service Area identified as "State DLF-1493 Loan Program" the sum of up to Two Hundred and One Thousand Dollars ($201,000) from activities in the Community Systems Support Service Area corresponding to the project described in Section 2.

 Section 4. The 1996 Annual Budget is hereby amended to reduce by TWO HUNDRED AND ONE THOUSAND DOLLARS ($201,000.00) the appropriations from the Housing and Community Development Revenue Sharing Fund (from 1996 Community Development Block Grant funds) for a capital project of the Department of Parks and Recreation in the Community Systems Support Service Area, and by appropriating the same TWO HUNDRED AND ONE THOUSAND DOLLARS ($201,000.00) to the Economic Development Service Area for loans to small businesses through the State DLF-1493 Loan Program operated by the Office of Economic Development as part of its overall small business lending activities. The unexpended balance of such appropriation shall carry forward unless abandoned by ordinance, provided, that the amounts of the reduction and appropriation in this Section each may be lowered in accordance with Section 5 below.

 Section 5. The Directors of Economic Development, Housing and Human Services and Finance are hereby authorized, upon completion of the grant period under the amendment authorized in Section 1 above, to take any necessary actions to balance the receipt of State grant funds with CDBG funds appropriated under Section 4 above. Such actions may include reprogramming such CDBG funds from the Economic Development Service Area back to the Community Facilities Support Service Area to fund the capital project identified in Section 2 of this Ordinance; reallocating CDBG Program Income that would otherwise by available for small business loans under Ordinances 116854 or 116341, from the Economic Development Service Area to such Parks Department capital project; and amending the City's Consolidated Plan accordingly. The intent of this Section is that the net amount added to small business lending under this Ordinance shall not exceed the final amount of the Supplemental State grant accepted hereunder. All necessary appropriations are hereby made and all necessary transfers hereby authorized to carry out the intent of this Section.

 Section 6. All program income, including interest and repayments of principal on small business loans, generated by funds appropriated in Section 4 above or in this Section, shall be deposited in the Housing and Community Development Revenue Sharing Fund and credited to "State DLF-1493 Loan Program". All such program income received on or before December 31, 1999, in an aggregate amount not to exceed SEVEN HUNDRED FIFTY THOUSAND AND NO/100 DOLLARS ($750,000.00), is hereby reappropriated for further small business loans by the Office of Economic Development consistent with CDBG regulations and the agreement amended pursuant to Section 1 above, as the same may be further amended. The unexpended balance of all appropriations under this Section shall carry forward from year to year unless expressly abandoned by ordinance.
