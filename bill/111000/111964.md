 WHEREAS, under the City's Land Use Code certain properties in Downtown zones, including those developed for use as low-income housing, are eligible to transfer unused development rights; and

 WHEREAS, by Ordinance 114029, as amended, the City has established a "TDR Bank" and authorized the Director of Housing and Human Services ("DHHS Director") to negotiate the purchase of development rights from low-income housing projects in order to aid in their preservation as low-income housing; and

 WHEREAS, the developer of a proposed low-income housing project has offered to sell TDRs in accordance with the City's Land Use Code; Now, Therefore,

 BE IT ORDAINED BY THE CITY OF SEATTLE AS FOLLOWS:

 Section 1. The DHHS Director is authorized, for and on behalf of The City of Seattle, to execute, deliver, perform, administer and enforce an agreement (the "Agreement") for the purchase of up to Twenty-eight Thousand, Forty-three square feet (28,043 sq. ft.) of TDRs for a price not to exceed Eleven Dollars ($11.00) per square foot, with such additional terms, conditions and documents as the DHHS Director shall deem necessary or appropriate to carry out the intent of this Ordinance. The TDRs shall be acquired from the property known as the Julie Apartments located at 1922 Ninth Avenue (the "Project"), legally described as follows:

 Lot 5, Block 35, Second Addition to the Town of Seattle as laid off by the Heirs of Sarah A. Bell, deceased, (commonly known as Heirs of Sarah A. Bell's 2nd Addition to the City of Seattle), according to the plat thereof recorded in Volume 1 of Plats, page 121, in King County, Washington.

 Section 2. Purchase of any amount of the TDRs from the Project is conditioned upon the Agreement including a commitment to provide housing units at rents affordable to low-income households with incomes at or below fifty per cent (50%) of median income for the Seattle-Everett-Bellevue Primary Statistical Area for a minimum of twenty (20) years, consistent with the City's Land Use Code and Director's Rule 20-93 published by the Seattle Department of Construction and Land Use. Such twenty (20) year period shall begin not later than five (5) years after the date of issuance of the final Certificate of Occupancy for the Project after rehabilitation.

 Section 3. The DHHS Director is further authorized, for and on behalf of the City, to accept and record a statutory warranty deed to the TDRs to be purchased and to execute, deliver, modify, administer and enforce such other agreements and documents as may be reasonably necessary to carry out the intent of this Ordinance.

 Section 4. Funds for the purchase of the TDRs shall be paid from amounts appropriated in the TDR/Mitigation Subfund of the Low-Income Housing Fund in the 1998 Adopted Budget, up to a total amount of Three Hundred Twenty-five Thousand, One Hundred And Twenty-seven Dollars ($325,127). In order to facilitate the redevelopment of the Project, the DHHS Director is authorized to cause the disbursement of funds in payment of the purchase price prior to the time that the Project meets all of the conditions to the transfer of TDRs under the Land Use Code, provided that there is reasonable assurance that such requirements will be satisfied. Such disbursement may be made in the form of an advance payment or as an interest-free bridge loan to be discharged by delivery of the deed to the TDRs when all conditions are satisfied, as the DHHS Director shall determine.

 Section 5. Any actions pursuant to the authority of this Ordinance and prior to its effective date are hereby ratified and confirmed.

 This ordinance shall take effect and be in force thirty (30) days from and after its approval by the Mayor, but if not approved and returned by the Mayor within ten (10) days after presentation, it shall take effect as provided by Municipal Code Section 1.04.020.
