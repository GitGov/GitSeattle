 AN ORDINANCE relating to the Community Development Block Grant Float Loan Program; authorizing a short-term loan of up to Eight Hundred Thousand Dollars ($ 800,000) in Block Grant funds to On The Boards, a Washington nonprofit corporation, for an economic development project involving the purchase the Queen Anne Hall; and authorizing an amendment to the City of Seattle's 1996 Consolidated Plan.

 WHEREAS, the City Council, by Ordinance 116402, adopted policies for short-term loans of Community Development Block Grant ("CDBG") funds, known as "CD Float Loans"; and

 WHEREAS, the City's Director of the Office of Economic Development has identified an economic development project in which the City would provide a short term loan to On The Boards to assist On The Boards to purchase the Queen Anne Hall building which it will use to create performance and retail space, thereby creating employment within the City; which job creation will satisfy the CD Float Loan policies, and the City's Loan Committee has approved the proposed loan in accordance with those policies; and

 WHEREAS, as part of this economic development project On The Boards will agree to direct certain of its performance and/or instructional activities to benefit the Central and Southeast areas of Seattle; and

 WHEREAS, the City's Comprehensive Plan (G17) states that the City should preserve developments of historic, architectural or social significance that contribute to the identity of an area; and

 WHEREAS, the preservation of the ACT Hall as a performance facility meets the intent of the City's Comprehensive Plan; and

 WHEREAS, the making of the proposed loan will not impair the implementation of other projects or programs of the City using CDBG funds; and

 WHEREAS, the expansion of the performance arts and its linkage to the Central and Southeast areas of Seattle are important policies of the City;
