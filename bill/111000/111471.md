 AN ORDINANCE reducing the hours of work for certain positions in the Department of Housing and Human Services, retitling such positions, establishing a voluntary deferred pay program therefor, and establishing rules for administration of the deferred pay program.

 WHEREAS funding for the Head Start/Early Childhood Education Assistance program has been reduced, requiring a reduction in staff, a reduction in pay, or a reduction in work hours; and

 WHEREAS the Department of Housing and Human Services wishes to continue to provide full staffing and support services to the Head Start/Early Childhood Education Assistance Program, and must therefore suspend non-critical operations; therefore

 BE IT ORDAINED BY THE CITY OF SEATTLE AS FOLLOWS:

 Section 1. The Department of Housing and Human Services (DHHS) is authorized to reduce the hours of work for full-time employees in the positions identified in Section 3 of this ordinance from two thousand eighty-eight (2,088) hours per calendar year to one thousand seven hundred seventy-five (1,775) hours per calendar year, effective October 1, 1996. DHHS is further authorized to schedule those hours of work over a ten (10) month period referred to hereinafter as the "active work year."

 Section 2. A. In order to retain the skilled and qualified program employees now on staff, a voluntary deferred pay program is hereby established in which Head Start/Early Childhood Education Assistance employees will continue to receive pay over a twelve (12) month period. Full-time deferred pay program participants (program participants) will be compensated at the rate of eighty-five percent (85%) of the regular rate of pay for salary range 30.5A for all regular hours, up to forty (40) hours per week, during the active work year. The remaining fifteen percent (15%) of compensation for regular pay hours will be considered an employee authorized deduction or withholding and will be put into a deferred pay account. The balance in the deferred pay account will be paid to program participants in biweekly pay warrants during the approximately two (2) month inactive period. During this inactive period, program participants will be compensated at the rate of 85% of the regular rate of pay for salary range 30.5A for eighty (80) hours per biweekly pay warrant until such time as his/her deferred pay account is exhausted.

 B. Participation in the deferred pay program is voluntary. At the beginning of each active work year, the employees in each of the positions identified in Section 3 will have the option of choosing whether or not to participate in the deferred pay program. Employees in Section 3 who choose not to participate in the deferred pay program will receive the full rate of pay for salary range 30.5A during the active work year, and will be subject to layoff at the end thereof.

 C. As long as program participants have not exhausted their deferred pay accounts, they will receive benefits consistent with full time pay status, and will continue to accrue sick leave and vacation during the inactive period.

 1. Assuming their deferred pay accounts have not been exhausted, program participants will continue to receive biweekly deferred pay payroll warrants in accordance with SMC 4.20.200 if called to jury duty during the inactive period, and in accordance with State and Federal laws if called to active military duty during the inactive period.

 2. Program participants who work more than forty (40) hours per week during the active work year will be eligible for overtime compensation in accordance with SMC 4.20.250 and Personnel Rules, Chapter 3, Section 5. Overtime will be calculated on the full rate of pay associated with salary range 30.5A. Program participants will receive 100% of the overtime compensation, and none of the overtime compensation will be credited to the deferred pay account.

 3. DHHS shall cash out any deferred pay account balance to a program participant who transfers to another position in the department or the City, or who separates from City service for any reason.

 4. Program participants who do not return after the inactive period as scheduled will be considered to have voluntarily quit their employment with the City.

 Section 3. The following positions are subject to the reduction in hours identified in Section 1 of this ordinance and are eligible to participate in the deferred pay program.

 Position #023207, Senior Grants and Contracts Specialist

 Position #024622, Senior Grants and Contracts Specialist

 Position #023470, Senior Grants and Contracts Specialist

 Position #020321, Senior Grants and Contracts Specialist

 Section 4. DHHS may return any deferred pay program participant to a regular compensation and leave schedule with a minimum of thirty (30) days notice to the program participant and to the Personnel Department, Classification/Compensation Unit.

 Section 5. The Head Start/Early Childhood Education Assistance Program relies on grant funding for its operations and is subject to unique personnel requirements pursuant to federal law. Because of such unique personnel requirements, the positions listed in Section 3 of this ordinance are hereby exempted from layoff provisions of SMC 4.04.220. In the event of a layoff, employees in Section 3 may not displace any employees not included in Section 3, nor may employees not included in Section 3 displace any employees in Section 3, even if such employees have the same classification.

 Section 6. Any acts made consistent with the authority and prior to the effective date of this ordinance are hereby ratified and confirmed.

 Section 7. This ordinance shall take effect and be in force thirty (30) days from and after its passage and approval, if approved by the Mayor; but if not approved by the Mayor within ten (10) days after presentation, it shall take effect as provided by Municipal Code Section 1.04.020.
