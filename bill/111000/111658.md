 AN ORDINANCE relating to additional regular property taxes for families and education; providing for the submission to the qualified electors of the City at a special election on September 16, 1997, of a proposition authorizing the City to levy regular property taxes for up to seven (7) years in excess of the limitation on levies in RCW 84.55.010 for the purpose of providing Seattle School District public school students, Seattle youth, and their families with educational and developmental services such as early childhood development, school-based student/family services, comprehensive student health services, out-of-school youth activities, and academic improvement activities; authorizing the creation of a new subfund; continuing an oversight committee; and authorizing implementing agreements.

 BE IT ORDAINED BY THE CITY OF SEATTLE AS FOLLOWS:

 Section 1. Findings. The City Council makes the following findings:

 a. Providing the educational and developmental services authorized by Section 5 of this ordinance is a City purpose as well as an educational purpose;

 b. The activities to be funded are supplemental to the basic education financed by the State of Washington and will not displace or reduce state funding for the public schools in the Seattle School District;

 c. In 1990, the voters of Seattle approved a measure that provided $69.2 million over seven years to finance programming of educational and developmental services to Seattle's children, youth, and families. These programs have proven successful at providing child care and out of school activities for over 30,000 children and youth, providing parent education and support services to at least 50,000 families, providing academic support and intervention to over 70,000 students, and other critical services aimed at keeping Seattle's children and youth safe, healthy, and ready to learn.

 d. An urgent need exists to continue the provision of the educational and developmental services to be financed with proceeds of additional regular property taxes, and its urgency requires submission to the qualified electors of The City of Seattle of a proposition authorizing regular property tax levies in excess of the levy limitation in RCW 84.55.010, as it now exists or may hereafter be amended, (commonly referred to as the 106% limit) for this sole purpose for up to seven (7) years at a special election to be held in conjunction with the state general election on September 16, 1997.

 Section 2. Definitions. As used in this ordinance, the following words when capitalized have the following meanings:

 a. "City" means The City of Seattle.

 b. "Educational and Developmental Services" means the array of programs and activities referred to in Section 5, with such modifications as the City Council may from time to time authorize.

 c. "Proceeds" means the additional regular property taxes levied and collected for the purposes and under the conditions provided in this ordinance, as authorized by the electorate pursuant to this ordinance and state law, and all interest and other earnings thereon that are deposited in the 1997 Families and Education Subfund of the Educational and Developmental Services Fund.

 d. "Seattle School District" and "School District" mean Seattle School District No. 1.

 Section 3. Levy of Additional Regular Property Taxes - Submittal. The City hereby submits to the qualified electors of the City a proposition as authorized by RCW 84.55.050 to exceed the levy limitation on regular property taxes contained in RCW 84.55.010 for property taxes levied in 1997 through 2003 for collection in 1998 through 2004, respectively, for the sole purpose of raising Sixty-Nine Million Dollars ($69,000,000) in aggregate over a period of up to seven (7) years, to provide Educational and Developmental Services for Seattle School District students, Seattle youth, and their families. The proposition shall be limited so that the City shall not levy in any year more than Fifteen Million Dollars ($15,000,000) in addition to the maximum amount of regular property taxes it could have levied consistent with chapter 84.55 RCW in the absence of this ordinance. Pursuant to RCW 84.55.050(4), the maximum regular property taxes that may be levied in 2004 for collection in 2005 and in later years shall be computed as if property taxes had not been increased under this ordinance.

 Section 4. Application of Proceeds. The proceeds of the additional taxes authorized under this ordinance shall be deposited in the City Treasury into a special 1997 Families and Education Subfund (the "Subfund") within the previously established Educational and Developmental Services Fund. Moneys in the Subfund may be temporarily deposited or invested in such manner as may be lawful for the investment of City money and interest and other earnings shall be deposited in the Subfund. The principal Proceeds and any interest or other earnings from their deposit or investment shall be applied solely for Educational and Developmental Services.

 Section 5. Educational and Developmental Services. Educational and Developmental Services funded by Proceeds are services designed to help address the needs of Seattle's public school children and Seattle's youth, with the intent of promoting learning, improving educational outcomes, and ensuring accessibility to services, and the administration of those services. Initially, Educational and Developmental Services shall be provided through a program with the following five (5) service components funded directly by Proceeds. Estimated 1998 allocations for these service components are:

 1. Early childhood development (major program elements include child care subsidies and quality enhancement, community-based Family Support Centers and parent education classes to ensure children are ready to transition to school and families have access to needed support).

 $1,456,761

 2. School-based student/family services (major program elements include elementary school Family Support Workers, counseling services for homeless children, parent involvement coordination, and support services targeted to middle school students in order to support families' involvement in their children's education and help students overcome issues that interfere with learning).

 $2,230,683

 3. Student health services (major program elements include enhanced health education and teen health centers in middle and high schools to improve students' health and promote healthy lifestyles).

 $2,370,000

 4. Out-of-School activities (major program elements include before and after school care for elementary age children and community and school-based programs for youth ages 11 - 18, in order to provide supervised and high quality activities for youth when not in school).

 $2,415,497

 5. Academic improvement activities (major program elements include the provision of resources and technical assistance to schools that require additional help in meeting student needs and improving academic performance).

 $ 500,000

 These 1998 service component descriptions and component allocations are only illustrative examples. In the annual City budget or by separate ordinance, the City shall from year-to-year determine the budget and allocations among the five (5) service components, add or delete service components or program elements within a service component, change the scope of activities or the emphasis, and, within a budget year in consultation with the Oversight Committee, reallocate unexpended and unencumbered funds from one program element or service component to another. Funds and appropriations unexpended at the end of any budget year shall automatically be carried over to the next budget year.

 Expenditures from the Subfund for central administrative support of these programs by the City and the School District shall not in any budget year exceed a total of five percent (5%) of that year's total expenditure authority from the Subfund.

 Section 6. Oversight Committee. The Oversight Committee established pursuant to Ordinance 115289, as modified by Ordinance 116430, shall continue in operation to review the expenditure of Proceeds; to advise upon expenditures and allocations for the following year, and to make recommendations on the implementation of particular programs and on any reallocations. The Oversight Committee shall consist of seven (7) members: the Mayor, the Chair of the City Council's Health, Housing, Human Services, Education and Libraries Committee or its successor with respect to education issues, a representative of the Seattle School Board, the Superintendent of the Seattle School District, and three (3) Seattle citizens who shall be appointed by the Mayor and confirmed by the City Council. Appointed members shall serve for a period of three (3) years, commencing at the respective dates of their appointments, subject to reappointment; appointed members shall be discharged from further service by two (2) consecutive unexcused absences, by moving their residence from Seattle, and for other cause. Members shall serve without pay, but may be reimbursed their expenses, including payments for child care while attending meetings. The Oversight Committee may adopt rules for its own procedures, including the frequency of meetings. The Director of Housing and Human Services shall provide staff and logistical support for the Oversight Committee.

 Section 7. Implementing Agreements. If the levy of additional taxes is authorized by the voters, the City may carry out the Educational and Developmental Services by agreements with the Seattle School District, with the Seattle-King County Health Department, and with such other agencies and persons as may be appropriate. The Mayor or the Mayor's designee is authorized to enter into such agreements. Agreements with other public entities shall contain either the then current equal employment opportunity/non-discrimination provisions, women's and minority business opportunity provisions, and disability accommodations requirements of the City or of the contracting public entity; all other agreements shall contain the City's then current requirements thereon.

 Section 8. Election - Ballot Title. The King County Director of Records and Elections, as ex officio supervisor of elections, is hereby requested to find the existence of an emergency, for the reasons stated in Subsection 1(d) of this ordinance, to assume jurisdiction of and to call and conduct a special election in conjunction with the state general election on September 16, 1997, and to submit to the qualified electors of the City the proposition set forth below.
