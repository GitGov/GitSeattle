 AN ORDINANCE creating a new department, Seattle Transportation Department, based on the functions contained within the former transportation division and related executive management functions of the Engineering Department; and amending or repealing an array of Seattle Municipal Code sections to accomplish this reorganization and to abolish the former Engineering Department.

 WHEREAS, the City has undertaken a comprehensive review and reorganization of its utility and transportation functions to take effect in the 1997-1998 biennium; and

 WHEREAS, as a result of that review, it has been determined that the transportation functions of the Engineering Department would be better served by being consolidated in a new, focused department, named Seattle Transportation; Now Therefore,

 BE IT ORDAINED BY THE CITY OF SEATTLE AS FOLLOWS:

 I. ABOLITION OF THE ENGINEERING DEPARTMENT AND TRANSFER OF FUNCTIONS

 Section 1. Abolition of the Engineering Department and Transfer of Powers, Duties and Resources Related to Transportation. Effective January 1, 1997, the Engineering Department is abolished. From and after that date, except as may be provided in an ordinance transferring certain utility and engineering service functions formerly contained in the Engineering Department to the Seattle Public Utilities, all functions responsibilities, agreements, obligations, authorizations, powers, equipment, records, appropriations, assets and liabilities of the Engineering Department related to transportation functions shall be transferred to the newly created department, Seattle Transportation. The Director of Transportation is hereby authorized to perform all responsibilities, duties and obligations and exercise all powers related to transportation functions heretofore belonging to the Director of Engineering.

 Section 2. Creation of Seattle Transportation. Effective January 1, 1997, there is created a new department, named Seattle Transportation, based on the Transportation Division of the former Engineering Department. Seattle Transportation, under the direction of the Director of Transportation, shall be responsible for maintenance and operation of streets, bridges, retaining walls and seawalls, and traffic control systems in the City.

 Section 3. Continuation of Authority. From and after January 1, 1997, all rules, regulations, notices and proceedings in effect with respect to the transportation functions of the former Engineering Department shall continue in effect unless and until they expire of their own terms or are superseded by order of the Director of Transportation or by ordinance.

 II. AMENDMENTS TO CODE SECTIONS

 A. PURPOSE

 Section 4. Purpose of Code Section Amendments. The purpose of amending the following array of Seattle Municipal Code sections is to accomplish the transfer of transportation functions from the former Engineering Department to the newly created department, Seattle Transportation. In doing so, it is inevitable that some specific sections which ought to have been amended will be overlooked. In such cases, therefore, any remaining references to the Engineering Department or the Director of Engineering which relate to transportation functions shall be interpreted to be references to Seattle Transportation and the Director of Transportation.

 A. The City shall reserve one (1) communication space on City-owned poles for its own use.

 B. If additional communication space is available on City-owned poles, after reserving one (1) space for the City and after accounting for the space occupied by existing services already on the poles, the City may permit additional attachments under the following conditions:

 1. The needs of the City are paramount. The City shall be the determinant regarding any question of right to attach, construction compliance or contract interpretation regarding attachment to poles. Permission to make attachments to the City's poles may be withdrawn for violation of applicable codes, for breach of contract, for failure to supply proof of required permits, by governmental directive or for any reason associated with the City's requirements for the use of its poles or public right-of-way. The City may direct the immediate removal of attachments at the owner's expense, if attachments fail to conform to codes or the City's requirements, or if attachments interfere with City operations.

 2. All attachments shall be made in accordance with all applicable codes as well as City electrical standards, guidelines and practices.

 3. All attachments, including co-lashing, shall be subject to approval of the ~~Department of Administrative Services, the Engineering Department~~Executive Services Department, Seattle Transportation and the City Light Department in accordance with the following principles, requirements and procedures:

 a. Providing for the safety of the public, City employees, and other users of poles is a fundamental principle which must be observed.

 b. The primary function of the City's poles is to support the City's electrical lines and equipment.

 c. The City shall neither replace existing poles with taller poles nor add crossarms to existing poles to create more communication space on the poles.

 d. Any new attachments must accommodate any prior agreements between the City and other entities regarding use of space on the poles.

 e. The City shall not relinquish the one (1) communication space reserved for its own use on every pole. At the request of the applicant, however, the City shall consider creating additional space for communication uses on the poles by taking such actions as removing secondary rack wiring and substituting triplex wire, moving streetlight fixtures, guy wires and other attachments to the poles and by providing for co-lashing. Any actions undertaken to create more communication space shall be considered make-ready work, and any such costs shall be borne by the applicant.

 f. Approval of attachments may include requirements for extra mitigation measures in certain areas, such as residential, critical areas and shoreline zones, greenbelts, parks, historic districts and viewsheds. All such extra measures, including any additional public involvement and/or environmental

 review, shall be taken in accordance with directives from the Superintendent of the City Light Department, and all costs associated with such extra measures and review shall be paid by the applicant.

 g. All make-ready costs, including any permit review and environmental review costs, shall be paid by the applicant prior to making any attachments to the poles.

 h. As a condition of securing the City's permission to use its poles for attachment of cable, all applicants shall be required to permit co-lashing to their own cable of up to two (2) other cables, which may be owned and operated by other entities. All cable attachments that initially occupy a space on a City-owned pole shall be required to provide an external or internal support ("messenger") wire that is capable of supporting two (2) other cables in addition to the initial cable installed by the applicant. Owners of cable subsequently co-lashed to the initial cable shall pay the owner of the initial cable a proportionate share of the cost of the messenger wire. All entities co-lashing together shall be required to provide one another with reciprocal indemnity provisions equivalent to those which must be granted to the City by each of them pursuant to Section 15.32.150. Co-lashing shall not be required of any applicant until all other spaces on the pole, other than the City's reserved space, have been utilized. The City Light Department shall issue a Department Policy and Procedure for providing co-lashing space based on costs, operational convenience, and other criteria which are developed in the course of producing such Department Policy and Procedure.

 i. In addition to the indemnification required by Section 15.32.150, the City may require that the applicant provide the City and entities permitted to co-lash with additional indemnification, such as indemnification from a parent company, and/or require that the applicant provide proof of specific insurance provisions acceptable to the City which cover potential exposure of both the applicant and the City.

 j. As a further condition of securing the City's permission to use its poles for attachment of cable, all applicants upon request shall be required to provide the City with capacity on the applicant's cable over and above the capacity specifications submitted by the applicant. Such additional capacity may be in the form of dedicated fiber or dedicated space on the same cable being installed by the applicant or in the form of separate cable, as specified by the Department of Administrative Services, and shall be dedicated to the City for as long as the cable is attached to the City's poles. The City shall have the right to use that capacity for any governmental purpose and the right to lease that capacity to any public or nonprofit entities. The incremental costs of adding the specified amount of capacity for the City shall be borne by the City.

 k. Applications for attachment to City-owned poles shall be submitted to the City Light Department. The City Light Department shall then coordinate that request with ~~the Engineering Department~~Seattle Transportation and the Department of Administrative Services. Approval of all three (3) departments shall be required prior to the issuance of a permit to attach to the poles.

 l. All applications for pole attachment shall be considered on a first-come, first-serve basis, provided that where space is limited, attachment permits shall be given first to public entities, second to entities which act as large-scale common carriers, third to entities which request attachment to six (6) poles or less for their own private communication needs, and fourth to others.

 m. If no space can be created on the poles requested, the applicant may seek an exception to any of the requirements set forth in this section by submitting a written request to a three (3) person review committee comprised of one (1) representative each from the ~~Department of Administrative Services, the Engineering Department~~Executive Services Department, Seattle Transportation  and the City Light Department. The committee shall review the request with reference to considerations which may warrant making an exception including, but not limited to reduced environmental effects, the lack of alternatives for achieving equivalent service available to the applicant, the lack of alternative routing which can be made available and the feasibility of undergrounding all or part of the cable. After engaging in a review of the application, the committee shall forward a recommendation to the Mayor and City Council. Any exceptions to the requirements of this section must be approved by ordinance.

 n. All entities that are provided attachments to City- owned poles, including attachments by means of co-lashing, shall pay a use fee for each such attachment at a rate established by ordinance, provided that fees established by prior agreement shall remain in effect until the expiration or termination of such agreement.

 Section 163. SMC 23.12.060 is hereby amended as follows:

 Multifamily land use policies.

 Policy 1: Multifamily Designation

 In designating areas for the various multifamily classifications, a match shall be sought between the physical characteristics of areas and the locational criteria established for the multifamily classifications in the Land Use Code. One objective is to increase opportunities for new housing development in order to ensure that there will be adequate capacity for future housing need. An equally important objective is to ensure that new development is compatible with neighborhood character.

 The achievement of both of these objectives will mean sensitively increasing the scale and intensity of development while attempting to minimize the impacts on existing character. The locational criteria are established so that new development will maintain a compatible scale in an area, preserve views, and enhance the streetscape and pedestrian environment, while achieving an efficient use of the land without major disruption of the natural environment.

 Policy 2: Multifamily Residential Classifications

 The multifamily classifications specify the types of housing permitted in the different multifamily areas. The housing types are defined in terms of: 1) height, bulk and setbacks, 2) the amount of usable open space and the physical relationship of the open space to individual units, and 3) the location and appearance of parking and access to parking. Development standards regulating these elements are intended to provide for a transition in scale between multifamily and single family areas, facilitate an attractive pedestrian environment at the street level, conform with the topography to maintain natural hills and valleys and preserve views, encourage new development which is compatible with existing neighborhood character, and enhance the livability of new housing. Cluster development is also

 encouraged in all classifications. A greater variety of housing types is encouraged, particularly in the lower classifications. Each of the multifamily classifications allows all housing types permitted in a less intense classification.

 - Lowrise Duplex/Triplex (LDT)

 Purpose of the Zone: The intent of the Lowrise Duplex/Triplex (LDT) zone is to provide opportunities for limited infill housing development, both through new construction and the conversion of existing single- family structures to duplexes and triplexes, in areas that do not meet the single-family criteria, but where, in order to preserve the character of the neighborhood, the recycling of existing structures to a slightly higher density and small-scale infill development is preferable to single-family zoning or to the development of townhouses or higher density apartments. Areas appropriate for designation as Lowrise Duplex/Triplex maintain a single-family character, but do not meet the criteria for designation as a single-family area under the Single-family Policies, and include a mix of single- family dwellings, duplexes, triplexes, and single- family structures already converted to multiple units. Council- adopted neighborhood plans may allow locating the LDT zone in an area otherwise meeting the criteria for designation as a single family zone in limited circumstances.

 Development standards for the zone are intended to ensure that new and converted structures are not only compatible with existing development, but are also reflective of the character of that development in terms of scale, open space, setbacks, siting, unit orientation, and provision of ground-level open space.

 - Lowrise 1 (L1)

 Purpose of the Zone: The intent of the Lowrise 1 zone is to provide areas for multifamily development of low height and small bulk where units have direct access to private, landscaped yards, thereby increasing housing opportunities for families with children and others seeking ground-related housing. The primary objective is the development of townhouses that are generally compatible in scale, siting, and landscaping with single family areas. Council-adopted neighborhood plans may allow locating the L1 zone in an area otherwise meeting the criteria for designation as a single family zone under limited circumstances. This zone is intended to provide a transition in intensity, rather than scale, between single-family and other multifamily areas.

 - Lowrise 2 (L2)

 Purpose of the Zone: The intent of the Lowrise 2 zone is to encourage a variety of multifamily housing types with less emphasis on ground- related units, while remaining at a scale compatible with single- family structures. Limits on height and bulk ensure a building scale that is consistent with the development of single lots and with the lower building heights characteristic of most lower density residential areas.

 - Lowrise 3 (L3)

 Purpose of the Zone: The intent of the Lowrise 3 zone is to provide additional housing opportunities in multifamily neighborhoods where it is desirable to limit development to infill projects and conversions compatible with the existing mix of houses and small to moderate scale apartments. To accommodate greater density allowed in the zone, L3 designations should be located in areas with adequate alley access and on- street parking.

 - Lowrise 4 (L4)

 Purpose of the Zone: The intent of the Lowrise 4 zone is to provide for higher density infill development in residential neighborhoods already characterized by larger, high density residential structures. To accommodate greater density allowed in the zone, L4 should be located in areas with good vehicular circulation, adequate alley access and on-street parking. In addition to housing types permitted in less intensive zones; new housing types appropriate for Lowrise 4 are four-story apartments.

 - Midrise (MR)

 Purpose of the Zone: The intent of the Midrise zone is to allow for higher density residential development in neighborhoods where significant concentrations of housing are desired and where services are available to accommodate such growth. This classification allows multifamily housing of a medium to large scale, fairly high density and heights greater than those in the lowrise zones. The development standards for the Midrise zone are intended to provide for larger scale structures while maintaining the livability of these high density residential areas. Development standards should include measures which minimize the appearance of bulk. Ground floor commercial use in apartment buildings is allowed in blocks adjacent to healthy commercial areas.

 - Highrise (HR)

 Purpose of the Zone: The intent of the Highrise zone is to allow very high-density residential development in areas where concentrations of such housing are desired and can be accommodated. This most intense residential classification allows development of highrise structures.

 In order to add activity and visual interest to the street environment and contribute to the neighborhood's livability, ground floor commercial use in residential buildings is permitted throughout Highrise areas and greater bulk may be permitted in the base of highrise structures.

 In order to provide public open spaces, preserve or provide low and moderate cost housing, preserve historically or architecturally significant buildings, or provide more space between towers to decrease view blockage and shadows on adjacent structures and open spaces, additional height beyond the height limit may be granted to structures in the Highrise zone.

 Policy 3: Density Limits

 The purpose of establishing limits on density is to provide greater predictability about the allowed intensity of development by specifying a maximum number of units achievable on sites in each lowrise multifamily classification. The density limits shall provide for a wide range of housing types and achieve development that is compatible with the predominant character of multifamily areas.

 Permitted density shall be determined on a lot area per dwelling unit basis. Each zone classification shall establish the minimum amount of lot area required for each permitted unit. Density limits for housing for low- income elderly and low-income disabled persons shall be established to provide for the special needs of these families. In the Lowrise Duplex/Triplex zone, new lots created for the construction of single family dwelling units shall comply with the minimum lot area requirements for Single Family 5000 zones.

 Implementation Guideline: Density Limits for Housing for Low-income Elderly or Low-income Disabled Persons

 In order to reduce costs and provide sufficient density to make the development of housing for low-income elderly and low-income disabled persons feasible, maximum density limits shall be increased for such housing in the L3 and L4 zones. The density limits reflect the fact that low-income elderly and low-income disabled families create less impacts than the general population, and that it is the City's policy to facilitate the development of housing for these families.

 Policy 4: Height of Buildings

 The intent of this policy is to establish predictable maximum heights, maintain a consistent height limit throughout the building envelope, maintain scale relationships with adjacent buildings under varying topographic conditions, reduce view blockage, and encourage pitched roofs. The appropriate height for an area shall be determined according to the locational criteria for the multifamily classifications. In order to encourage a residential character and to accommodate appropriate mechanical equipment, additional height exceptions may be permitted for pitched roofs and special rooftop features.

 The height measurement technique shall assure predictable maximum heights consistent with the maximum height limit permitted in these zones and shall reflect the natural contours of the land. Artificially created grades to gain height advantages shall be prohibited. Height measurement techniques implementing these policies shall be established in the Land Use Code.

 Policy 5: Bulk Requirements

 Bulk limits are established to conform with the prevailing pattern of development in the surrounding area, to prevent the development of wide buildings which block views, and to encourage infill development. In order to minimize the appearance of bulk, modulation techniques shall be used which allow buildings to be wider than their neighbors while appearing compatible. In each classification, there are established two sets of width limits: more restrictive limitations for unmodulated buildings and less restrictive limits for buildings which minimize the appearance of bulk through modulation.

 Implementation Guideline 1: Width and Depth Limitations

 Width and depth limits are established in multifamily classifications to ensure the scale of development is generally compatible with existing character, to maintain light and air and encourage single lot development.

 Implementation Guideline 2: Modulation Requirements

 Modulation requirements are established to reduce the appearance of bulk. Modulation shall be required along the front facade of a building to allow increases in the building width. The width of modulation shall vary by zoning classification and housing type.

 Implementation Guideline 3: Lot Coverage

 To ensure that there is an adequate proportion of open area on a site relative to the area occupied by structures, and to provide residents of multifamily areas with sufficient access to light and air, a maximum limit on lot coverage shall be established for apartment and townhouses structures in lowrise zones. In order to encourage development of ground-related housing, greater lot coverage shall be allowed for townhouses in lowrise zones.

 Policy 6: Open Space

 Multifamily developments shall be required to provide open space for the use of the residents, in order to maintain existing street patterns of landscaped front yards, encourage permeable surfaces and vegetation and mitigate the cumulative effects of development.

 Ground-related housing shall have ground-level open space which is directly accessible to each unit and is for the private use of the residents of that unit. In order to ensure the privacy of the open space, openings (windows, doors, etc.) on walls adjacent to the open space which are part of a different unit or common areas shall be prohibited.

 Usable open space for terraced housing must be directly accessible to each unit but may be located above ground level on the rooftop of units below.

 Apartments shall have usable ground level open space for the residents of the building. Some required open space may be provided as private decks and balconies.

 Highrise apartments shall have a significant portion of the lot area as usable open space for the use of the residents. Some of the open space requirements may be met with areas which are located above ground level but are not higher than the roof of the base structure.

 Policy 7: Setback Requirements

 Setback requirements are established to ensure light and air to residents of multifamily structures, and compatibility of new development with the existing pattern of multifamily areas. Front setbacks shall maintain existing setback patterns and view corridors parallel to streets. Infill development that is compatible in scale and siting with surrounding buildings and maintains the pattern of landscaping along the street frontage shall be encouraged. Open balconies, decks and bay windows shall, within limits, be allowed to project over the required front setback. Minimum side and rear setback requirements shall be established to provide light, air, solar access, and privacy of units. Side setback requirements shall vary depending on the height and depth of the building.

 Implementation Guideline 1: Front Setbacks

 Front setbacks shall be required of new development. To ensure that new development is compatible with the existing pattern in the area, the minimum depth of the required front setback shall generally be determined by the average of the setback of buildings on adjoining lots, measured from the front property line to the closest wall.

 Implementation Guideline 2: Side Setback Requirements

 In order to provide a minimum sense of privacy, openness, light and air, to gain solar access, and to mitigate shadows cast on adjacent sites, side setbacks shall be required. The required side setback shall vary depending on the height and depth of a structure. Averaging the required setback shall be allowed to encourage modulation and visual interest of side facades.

 Implementation Guideline 3: Rear Setback Requirements

 In order to ensure light and air and privacy to residents of multifamily structures, to maintain the pattern of existing rear setbacks, and to provide adequate transition between zones of differing intensity, rear setbacks shall be established. The greater the width and height of the structure, the greater the setback.

 Implementation Guideline 4: Projections Into Setbacks

 To encourage features that add visual interest to buildings, additional provisions shall allow specific architectural features such as decks, open balconies, and bay or oriel windows to project into required setbacks, provided they are at a specified distance from the property lines and do not adversely affect neighboring lots.

 Policy 8: Quantity of Required Off-Street Parking

 Off-street parking shall be required for new housing developments. In establishing the parking ratio, a balance shall be sought between the need for new developments to meet approximate parking demand on site to avoid adding to the congestion of parked cars on surrounding streets, against the countervailing need to minimize the costs of housing associated with required off-street parking, and to recognize the City's energy policies which encourage the use of public transit and discourage the use of automobiles.

 In recognition of these countervailing needs and policies, the required parking ratio for multifamily residential units shall reasonably mitigate the most significant parking impacts, ensuring the ratio is an adequate amount when considered against the needs to keep housing costs low. Therefore, the parking ratio shall vary according to the type of housing, the project and unit size and the number of bedrooms.

 In order to respond to those situations in which the parking demand of the occupants may be significantly different than those of the general population, exceptions shall be made for special occupant groups, in certain situations where new units are added to existing development, and in apartments containing units with multiple bedrooms.

 These parking ratios shall be established in the Land Use Code. Additional mitigation of parking impacts may be required under the State Environmental Policy Act (SEPA) where on-street parking is already at capacity as defined by the Seattle ~~Engineering~~ Transportation Department or where the development itself would cause on-street parking to reach capacity as so defined, provided that parking impact mitigation in multifamily zones under SEPA may not include reduction in development density. Mitigation under any other administrative review procedure shall not be required.

 To ensure that this policy reflects as accurately as possible automobile ownership patterns and parking demand in Seattle, the City shall monitor the implementation of this policy and conduct a study to evaluate parking demand.

 Implementation Guideline 1: Quantity of Required Parking

 The overall off-street parking provided for new development of multifamily housing shall approximate the city's average parking demand, by establishing parking at ratios that reflect the likely demand of the unit's occupants. In order to ensure mitigation of significant parking impacts, the requirement shall increase as unit and project size increase. Additional parking shall be required for structures with a significant number of units with three or more bedrooms. However, to encourage infill development of family-type housing, the minimum parking requirement of one off-street space per unit shall be maintained for small ground-related projects.

 Implementation Guideline 2: Parking Overlays

 In order to ensure that new housing development will not increase on- street parking congestion or to acknowledge areas in which parking demand may be less than the requirement, parking overlays may be established to alter the minimum ratio of parking spaces per unit.

 Policy 9: Location and Appearance of Required Off- Street Parking

 Off-street parking for multifamily structures shall maintain an attractive environment at street level, continue the existing pattern of landscaped front yards, facilitate traffic flow, and sustain on- street parking capacity.

 In order to achieve these goals, the location of parking in the front of multifamily buildings shall be prohibited except as specified below. Parking shall be located in the rear or side of the lot or built into or under the structure. Access to parking shall be required to be from the alley, where alleys are improved and accessible, except in specified cases where a high intensity area borders on a lower density area. Alley improvement is encouraged but not generally required. Width of curb cuts is limited. Where parking would be directly visible from the street side, it shall be screened and landscaped along the street side.

 Exceptions to these guidelines shall be permitted in order to encourage and facilitate development of ground- related housing, avoid creating additional construction costs, and to buffer areas of low intensity development.

 Off-site accessory use parking shall be prohibited in Lowrise and Midrise areas.

 In order to encourage shared parking facilities and to provide the flexibility to develop parking separate from residential structures in Highrise areas, off-site accessory use parking structures shall be permitted in Highrise areas, subject to administrative review. Criteria for approval shall ensure that such parking is compatible with the residential character of the area. Development standards for curb cuts, screening and landscaping, setbacks, height, access, signs, and lighting shall be met.

 Policy 10: Expansion or Renovation of Existing Residential Structures

 The expansion and renovation of existing residential structures, and addition of new residential units to existing residential structures in multifamily areas, shall be allowed. Any new part of the structure shall conform to the development standards. No expansion, renovation or addition allowed under this policy shall increase any existing non- conformity. The intent of this policy is to encourage increases in the existing housing supply and encourage improvements to existing residential structures. Expansions of non-conforming structures to provide access for the elderly and physically disabled, fire exits and other features required by applicable laws shall be allowed.

 Policy 11: Adding Residential Units To Existing Structures With Non- Conforming Uses

 The City shall encourage the conversion of buildings containing non- conforming uses to ones which contain multifamily uses by allowing alterations or expansions to structures as long as such alterations or expansions conform to the development standards of the particular multifamily classification. The intent of this policy is to promote additions to multifamily housing stock while controlling physical expansion, in order to maintain the pattern of development in the surrounding area.

 Policy 12: Principal Use

 The principal or primary use of multifamily areas shall be multifamily residential. The intent is to help preserve the character of multifamily residential areas, discourage the demolition of residences and displacement of residents, and preserve land and development opportunities for multifamily use. In order to protect multifamily residential areas from negative impacts of incompatible uses, the number and type of non- residential uses permitted in these areas shall be limited.

 Policy 13: Accessory Uses

 In order to allow greater flexibility within permitted uses, accessory uses clearly incidental to the permitted use, such as home occupations or offices in religious institutions, shall be permitted as detailed in the Land Use Code.

 An exception to this general rule will be made for neighborhood- oriented business and commercial uses, which may be established on the ground floor of apartment buildings. Such ground floor commercial use will be permitted in Midrise areas in close proximity to healthy business and commercial districts and throughout Highrise areas. The intent of this provision is to allow a mix of multifamily housing with business and commercial uses that may help reinforce commercial areas, while remaining compatible with the residential use, and to provide services to the multifamily areas.

 Policy 14: Small Institutions and Public Facilities

 The City recognizes the positive contribution many institutions and public facilities have made to the residential areas in which they are located, respecting community needs and providing necessary services. Therefore, small institutions and public facilities shall be allowed to establish or expand in multifamily areas, provided they are compatible with the residential character and scale of the area. Small institutions of five or more acres which wish to expand outside their existing campus, and small institutions which find that the development standards of the multifamily classification in which they are located are inadequate to their development needs, may be considered for Major Institution status.

 The provisions of this policy shall apply to all small institutions and public facilities located in multifamily areas.

 Implementation Guideline 1: General Development Standards

 The following development standards for institutional and public facility development are included in the Land Use Code:

 1) Building Height, Bulk and Setbacks;

 2) Open Space, Landscaping and Screening.

 These standards shall be similar to those required of housing, but should be allowed to vary somewhat because of the special structural requirements of some institutional uses. Criteria shall be established, limiting variation in order to achieve design compatibility with scale and character of the surrounding area. Height limits, however, with the exception of spires on religious institutions, shall not be allowed to vary from the height limit for multifamily development.

 Additional standards, not required of residential uses, shall also be established for institutions and public facilities in multifamily areas. They include:

 1) Light and Glare: Non-reflective surfaces shall be used to help reduce glare; lighting of structures, signing and parking shall be reflected away from adjacent uses.

 2) Noise: Standards for noise, based on traffic and hours of operation, shall be included in the Land Use Code. The standards may vary with the intensity of the multifamily zone classification.

 3) Parking and Transportation: Standards for required off-street parking shall be established in the Land Use Code. The intent of this policy is not to require institutions and public facilities to satisfy all parking demands generated by their staffs, clients, and visitors. Institutions or facilities which generate sufficient traffic and parking to adversely impact the surrounding residential area shall be required to prepare and implement a transportation plan which demonstrates how they will reduce traffic impacts and aggressively pursue the use of public transit, carpools and/or vanpools. Number of employees and anticipated clientele shall be an indication of the need to require such a plan (specific criteria shall be established). Parking needs which cannot be met by alternative transportation modes shall be accommodated by an on-site parking facility provided by the institution or facility.

 Increased traffic and parking expected to occur due to the establishment or expansion of the institution or facility shall not be permitted to create a serious safety problem or be a blighting influence on the surrounding neighborhood. The negative impacts of traffic and parking may be mitigated by locating parking facilities to avoid drawing traffic through residential streets, or establishing joint use of existing parking with adjacent uses.

 Standards for required off-street parking associated with uses which require administrative review may be modified through the review process. The number of required parking spaces for a given institution or facility shall be based on the anticipated use of the facility, size of meeting or assembly areas, hours of use, anticipated effects of parking on the surrounding community, information contained in the transportation plan, access to public transportation and carpools, and other considerations of need and impact.

 Implementation Guideline 2: Administrative Review

 Development standards for institutions shall be used whenever possible to reduce the need for an administrative review, thus shortening the development process and providing more certainty and predictability for land owners, local residents, and developers. However, departures from the development standards shall be allowed through an administrative review process, which will evaluate the proposal for consistency with multifamily policy objectives and intent. This review process assures neighboring areas that the unique features of the use and the area will be considered when determining the acceptability of a use for a given location. Public notification and opportunity for comment shall be a part of the review process.

 Implementation Guideline 3: Concentration of Institutions and Public Facilities

 Institutions and public facilities shall not be concentrated if that concentration creates or further aggravates parking shortages, traffic congestion, and noise in or near residential areas. Standards relating to concentration shall be developed in the Land Use Code.

 Implementation Guideline 4: Demolition or Conversion of Residential Structures

 Residential structures may be demolished or converted if necessary for the expansion of the facility. However, no residential structure shall be demolished in order to develop a non-required parking lot. Any building which is on the City, State or National Historic Register shall be preserved whenever possible.

 Implementation Guideline 5: Expansion of Non-Conforming Structures

 The intent of this policy is to encourage the continued use of non- conforming institutional facilities; therefore, rather than restricting work on the structures to normal maintenance only, allowances for expansion or structural changes are allowed. Institutions and public facilities in non-conforming structures shall be allowed to expand as long as such expansion does not increase the structure's non- conformity and is within the development standards of the zone.

 Implementation Guideline 6: Public Facilities

 Public facilities which do not meet the definition of a small institution may be located in multifamily areas for reasons of public necessity. However, relationship with surrounding uses shall be a consideration in the design, siting, landscaping and screening of such facilities. Parking and transportation considerations shall also be evaluated. Such facilities are unique and are not provided by the private sector. Their location and expansion shall be determined by specific public service delivery needs. If a City facility and site have been approved by ordinance through a public process which includes notice and discussion of land use and environmental issues, an additional administrative review shall not be required.

 Policy 15: Joint Use or Re-Use of Public Schools

 The continued use of public school buildings which are no longer fully utilized as schools shall be encouraged in order to retain the facility for possible future school use. Therefore, the joint use or re-use of public school facilities shall be allowed in multifamily areas. Nonresidential uses otherwise not permitted in multifamily areas shall be allowed to locate in school buildings as long as specific criteria for such re-use are met.

 Implementation Guideline 1: Criteria for Proposed Uses

 Criteria for judging the acceptability of proposed uses of school buildings shall be determined for each school and may differ from school to school. The criteria shall address the effects of the uses on students, teachers, and residents of the surrounding area, and traffic, parking and other land use impacts. The specific criteria for each school shall be determined by a process which insures the participation of representatives from the Seattle School District, the City of Seattle, and the neighborhood involved.

 Implementation Guideline 2: Review Process

 Joint use or re-use of public school buildings shall be permitted subject to a review process described in the Land Use Code to assure the use is consistent with the criteria developed. This shall be the only review of the use; joint or new uses shall not be subject to additional review under Policy 14, Small Institutions and Public Facilities.

 Implementation Guideline 3: Retention of School Structure

 Exceptions to existing land use policies and zoning for joint use or re-use of a school site will be allowed only when the principal school structures are retained. If the school building is demolished, that site shall be subject to the adopted land use policies and zoning requirements of that area classification.

The area of the setback may be used to meet any development standards, except that required parking may not be located in the setback. Underground structures which would not prevent the future widening and improvement of the right-of-way may be permitted in the required setback by the Director of Construction and Land Use after consulting with the Director of ~~Engineering~~Transportation.

 (2) Grading Requirement. When a setback is required, all structures on the lot shall be designed to accommodate the grade of the future street according to the Street Improvement Manual.

 (3) No-protest Agreement Requirement. A no-protest agreement to future street improvements shall be required, as authorized by RCW Chapter 35.43. The agreement shall be recorded with the King County Department of Records and Elections.

 2. Projects With Reduced Improvement Requirements.

 a. One (1) or Two (2) Dwelling Units. When one (1) or two (2) dwelling units are proposed to be constructed, or one (1) or two (2) Single Family zoned lots are proposed to be created, the following requirements shall be met:

 (1) If there is no existing hard-surfaced roadway, a crushed-rock roadway at least sixteen feet (16') in width shall be required, according to the Street Improvement Manual.

 (2) All structures on the lot(s) shall be designed to accommodate the grade of the future street improvements.

 (3) A no-protest agreement to future street improvements shall be required, as authorized by RCW Chapter 35.43. The agreement shall be recorded with the King County Department of Records and Elections.

 b. Other Projects With Reduced Requirements. The types of projects listed in this subsection D2b are exempt from right-of-way dedication requirements and are subject to the street improvement requirements of this subsection:

 (1) Types of Projects.

 i.Proposed developments which contain fewer than ten (10) units in SF, LDT and L1 zones, and six (6) residential units in all other zones;

 ii.The following uses when they are smaller than seven hundred fifty (750) square feet of gross floor area: fast-food restaurants, major and minor vehicle repair uses, and multipurpose convenience stores;

 iii.Nonresidential structures which have less than four thousand (4,000) square feet of gross floor area and which do not contain uses listed in subsection D2b(1)ii which are larger than seven hundred fifty (750) square feet;

 iv.Structures containing a mix of residential and nonresidential uses, if there are fewer than ten (10) units in SF, LDT and L1 zones, or fewer than six (6) residential units in all other zones, and the square footage of nonresidential use is less than specified in D2b(1)ii and D2b(1)iii;

 v.Remodeling and use changes within existing structures;

 vi.Additions to existing structures which are exempt from environmental review; and

 vii.Expansions of a surface parking area or open storage area of less than twenty percent (20%) of parking area or storage area or number of parking spaces.

 (2) Paving Requirement. For the types of projects listed in subsection D2b(1), the streets abutting the lot shall have a hard-surfaced roadway at least eighteen feet (18') wide. If there is not an eighteen-foot (18') wide hard-surfaced roadway, the roadway shall be paved to a width of at least twenty feet (20') from the lot to the nearest hard-surfaced street meeting this requirement, or one hundred feet (100'), whichever is less. Streets that form a dead end at the property to be developed shall be improved with a cul-de-sac or other vehicular turnaround in accordance with the Street Improvement Manual. The Director, after consulting with the Director of ~~Engineering~~Transportation, shall determine whether the street has the potential for being extended or whether it forms a dead end because of topography and/or the layout of the street system.

 (3) Other Requirements. The setback, grading and no-protest agreement requirements of subsection D1b shall also be met.

 3. Exceptions from Required Street Improvements. The Director may waive or modify the requirements for paving and drainage, dedication, setbacks, grading, no-protest agreements,

 landscaping and curb and sidewalk installation when it is determined that one (1) or more of the following conditions are met:

 a. Location in an environmentally critical area, disruption of existing drainage patterns, or removal of natural features such as significant trees makes widening and/or improving the right-of-way impractical or undesirable.

 b. The existence of a bridge, viaduct or structure such as a substantial retaining wall makes widening the right-of-way impractical or undesirable.

 c. Widening the right-of-way and/or improving the street would adversely affect the character of the street, as it is defined in an adopted neighborhood plan or adopted City plan for street parks, boulevards, or other special rights-of-way, or would otherwise conflict with the stated goals of such a plan.

 d. Widening and/or improving the right-of-way would eliminate street access to an existing lot.

 e. Widening and/or improving the right-of-way would make building on a lot infeasible by reducing it to dimensions where development standards cannot reasonably be met.

 f. One (1) or more substantial principal structures on the same side of the block as the proposed project are located in the area needed for future expansion of the right-of-way and the structure(s)' condition and size make future widening of the remainder of the right-of-way unlikely.

 g. Widening and/or improving the right-of-way is impractical because topography would preclude the use of the street for vehicular access to the lot, for example due to an inability to meet the required twenty percent (20%) maximum driveway slope.

 h. Widening and/or improving the right-of-way is not necessary because it is adequate for current and potential pedestrian and vehicular traffic, for example, due to the limited number of lots served by the development or because the development on the street is at zoned capacity.

 Section 197. SMC 23.53.020 is hereby amended as follows:

 Improvement requirements for existing streets in industrial zones.

The applicant may choose the street to which the pavement will be installed. If the alley does not extend from street to street, and the connecting street is an arterial designated on Exhibit 23.53.015 A, either the remainder of the alley shall be improved so that it is passable to a passenger vehicle, or a turnaround shall be provided. The turnaround may be provided by easement.

 2. When the alley is not used for access, if the alley is not fully improved, all structures shall be designed to accommodate the grade of the future alley improvements, and a no-protest agreement to future alley improvements shall be required, as authorized by RCW Chapter 35.43. The agreement shall be recorded with the King County Department of Records and Elections.

 F. Existing Alleys Which Do Not Meet the Minimum Width.

 1. When an existing alley is used for access to parking spaces, open storage, or loading berths on a lot, and the alley does not meet the minimum width established in subsection D, except as provided in subsection G, a dedication equal to half the difference between the current alley right-of-way width and minimum right-of-way width established in subsection D shall be required; provided, however, that if right-of-way has been dedicated since 1982, other lots on the block shall not be required to dedicate more than that amount of right-of-way. Underground and overhead portions of structures that would not interfere with the functioning of the alley may be allowed by the Director of Construction and Land Use after consulting with the Director of ~~Engineering~~Transportation . When existing structures are located in the portion of the lot to be dedicated, that portion of the lot shall be exempt from dedication requirements. The improvements required under subsection E1 shall then be installed, depending on the type of project.

 a. A setback equal to half the distance between the current alley right-of-way width and the minimum right-of-way width established in subsection D shall be required; provided, however, that if a setback has been provided under this provision, other lots on the block shall provide the same setback. The area of the setback may be used to meet any development standards, except that required parking may not be located in the setback. Underground and overhead structures which would not prevent the future widening and improvement of the right-of-way may be permitted in the required setback by the Director of Construction and Land Use after consulting with the Director of ~~Engineering~~Transportation.

 b. All structures shall be designed to accommodate the grade of the future alley right-of-way.

 c. A no-protest agreement to future street improvements shall be required, as authorized by RCW Chapter 35.43. The agreement shall be recorded with the title to the property with the King County Department of Records and Elections.

 G. Exceptions. The Director, after consulting with the Director of the Department of ~~Engineering~~Transportation, may modify or waive the requirements for dedication, paving and drainage, setbacks, grading and no-protest agreements, if it is determined that one (1) or more of the following conditions are met. The Director may require access to be from a street if alley improvements are also waived.

 1. Location in an environmentally critical area, disruption of existing drainage patterns, or removal of natural features such as significant trees makes widening and/or improving the right-of-way impractical or undesirable;

 2. Widening and/or improving the right-of-way would make a building on a lot infeasible by reducing it to dimensions where development standards cannot reasonably be met;

 3. Widening and/or improving the right-of-way would eliminate alley access to an existing lot;

 4. Widening and/or improving the right-of-way is impractical because topography precludes the use of the alley for vehicular access to the lot;

 5. The alley is in a historic district or special review district, and the Department of Neighborhoods Director finds, after review and recommendation by the appropriate review board, that the widening and/or improvement would be detrimental to the character and goals of the district.

 Section 199. SMC 23.54.015 is hereby amended as follows:

 Required parking.

 A. The minimum number of off-street parking spaces required for specific uses shall be based upon gross floor area, unless otherwise specified, as set forth in Chart A, except for uses located in downtown zones, which are regulated by Section 23.49.016, and major institution uses, which are regulated by Section 23.54.016. (See Chart A for Section 23.54.015.)

 B. In the case of a use not specifically mentioned on Chart A, the requirements for off-street parking shall be determined by the Director. The Director's determination shall be based on the requirements for the most comparable uses.

 C. Existing parking deficits of legally established uses shall be allowed to continue even if a change of use occurs. This provision shall not apply to a change of use to one defined as a heavy traffic generator.

 D. In all zones except downtown zones, no parking shall be required for the first twenty-five hundred (2,500) square feet of gross floor area of a structure containing nonresidential uses. This waiver shall not apply to structures or portions of structures occupied by fast-food restaurants, motion picture theaters, administrative offices, or institutional uses, including major institution uses. When two (2) or more uses with different parking ratios occupy a structure, the twenty-five hundred (2,500) square foot waiver shall be prorated based on the area occupied by the nonresidential uses for which the parking waiver is permitted.

 E. Commercial uses permitted in midrise and highrise zones according to Section 23.45.110 shall have no parking requirement over that required for residential use in the same structure. Up to ten parking spaces per business establishment may be provided at the discretion of the applicant.

 F. Exceptions to the parking requirements set forth in this section are provided in Section 23.54.020, Parking quantity exceptions, unless otherwise specified in Chart A.

 G. Except in downtown zones, off-street parking for fleet vehicles shall be provided separately, in addition to the minimum parking requirements.

 Section 200. SMC 23.54.016 is hereby amended as follows:

 Major Institutions-Parking and transportation.

 Major Institution uses shall be subject to the following transportation and parking requirements:

 A. General Provisions.

 1. Minimum requirements for parking quantity are established in subsection B of this section.

 2. The maximum number of spaces provided for the Major Institution use shall not exceed one hundred thirty-five percent (135%) of the minimum requirement, except through administrative or Council review as provided in subsection C.

 3. Parking requirements for major institutions with more than one (1) type of institutional use (for example, a hospital and a university), shall be calculated for each use separately, and then added together to derive the total number of required spaces.

 4. When a permit application is made for new development at an existing major institution, parking requirements shall be calculated both for the entire major institution and for the proposed new development. If there is a parking deficit for the entire institution, the institution shall make up a portion of the deficit in addition to the quantity required for the new development, according to the provisions of subsection B5. If there is a parking surplus, above the maximum allowed number of spaces, for the institution as a whole, requirements for new development will first be applied to the surplus in the required ratio of long-term and short-term spaces. Additional parking shall be permitted only when no surplus remains.

 5. When determining parking requirements, individuals fitting into more than one (1) category (for example, a student who is also an employee or a faculty member who is also a doctor) shall not be counted twice. The category requiring the greater number of parking spaces shall be used.

 B. Parking Quantity Required. The minimum number of parking spaces required for a Major Institution shall be as follows:

 1. Long-term Parking.

 a. Medical Institutions. A number of spaces equal to eighty percent (80%) of hospital-based doctors; plus twenty-five percent (25%) of staff doctors; plus thirty percent (30%) of all other employees present at peak hour;

 b. Educational Institutions. A number of spaces equal to fifteen percent (15%) of the maximum students present at peak hour, excluding resident students; plus thirty percent (30%) of employees present at peak hour; plus twenty-five percent (25%) of the resident unmarried students; plus one (1) space for each married student apartment unit.

 2. Short-term Parking.

 a. Medical Institutions. A number of spaces equal to one (1) space per six (6) beds; plus one (1) space per five (5) average daily outpatients;

 b. Educational Institutions. A number of spaces equal to five percent (5%) of the maximum students present at peak hour excluding resident students.

 3. Additional Short-term Parking Requirements. When one (1) of the following uses is a Major Institution use, the following additional short-term parking requirements shall be met. Such requirements may be met by joint use of parking areas and facilities if the Director determines that the uses have different hours of operation according to Section 23.54.020 G:

 a. Museum. One (1) space for each two hundred fifty (250) square feet of public floor area;

 b. Theater, Auditorium, or Assembly Hall. One (1) space for each two hundred (200) square feet of audience assembly area not containing fixed seats, and one (1) space for every ten (10) seats for floor area containing fixed seats;

 c. Spectator Sports Facility Containing Fewer than Twenty Thousand (20,000) Seats. One (1) space for each ten (10) permanent seats and one (1) space for each one hundred (100) square feet of spectator assembly area not containing fixed seats;

 d. Spectator Sports Facility Containing Twenty Thousand (20,000) or More Seats. One (1) space for each ten (10) permanent seats and one (1) bus space for each three hundred (300) permanent seats.

 4. Bicycle Parking. Bicycle parking meeting the development standards of Section 23.54.015 I4 and subsection D2 shall be provided in the following quantities:

 a. Medical Institutions. A number of spaces equal to two percent (2%) of employees, including doctors, present at peak hour;

 b. Educational Institutions. A number of spaces equal to ten percent (10%) of the maximum students present at peak hour plus five percent (5%) of employees.

 If at the time of application for a master use permit, the applicant can demonstrate that the bicycle parking requirement is inappropriate for a particular institution because of topography, location, nature of the users of the institution or other reasons, the Director may modify the bicycle parking requirement.

 5. Parking Deficits. In addition to providing the minimum required parking for a new structure, five percent (5%) of any vehicular or bicycle parking deficit as determined by the minimum requirements of this subsection, existing on the effective date of this ordinance, shall be supplied before issuance of a certificate of occupancy.

 C. Requirement for a Transportation Management Program.

 1. When a major institution proposes parking in excess of one hundred thirty-five percent (135%) of the minimum requirement for short-term parking spaces, or when a major institution prepares a master plan or applies for a master use permit for development that would require twenty (20) or more parking spaces or increase the major institution's number of parking spaces by twenty (20) or more above the level existing on the effective date of this provision, a transportation management program shall be required. The Director shall assess the traffic and parking impacts of the proposed development against the general goal of reducing the percentage of the major institution's employees, staff and/or students who commute in single-occupancy vehicles ("SOV") during the peak period to fifty percent (50%) or less, excluding those employees or staff whose work regularly requires the use of a private automobile during working hours.

 2. Transportation management programs shall be prepared and implemented in accordance with the Director's Rule governing Transportation Management Programs.

 3. If an institution has previously prepared a transportation management program, the Director, in consultation with the Director of ~~Engineering~~Transportation, shall review the major institution's progress toward meeting stated goals. The Director shall then determine:

 a. That the existing program should be revised to correct deficiencies and/or address new or cumulative impacts; or

 b. That the application will not be approved until the major institution makes substantial progress toward meeting the goals of its existing program; or

 c. That a new program should be developed to address impacts associated with the application; or

 d. That a revised or new program is not needed.

 4. Through the process of reviewing a transportation management program in conjunction with reviewing a master plan, the Council may approve in excess of one hundred thirty-five percent (135%) of the minimum requirements for long-term parking spaces, or may increase or decrease the stated fifty percent (50%) SOV goal, based upon the major institution's impacts on traffic and opportunities for alternative means of transportation. Factors to be considered shall include, but not be limited to:

 a. Proximity to a street with fifteen (15) minute transit service headway in each direction;

 b. Air quality conditions in the vicinity of the major institution;

 c. The absence of other nearby traffic generators and the level of existing and future traffic volumes in and through the surrounding area;

 d. The patterns and peaks of traffic generated by major institution uses and the availability or lack of on-street parking opportunities in the surrounding area;

 e. The impact of additional parking on the major institution site;

 f. The extent to which the scheduling of classes reduces the transportation alternatives available to students and faculty or the presence of limited carpool opportunities due to the small number of employees; and

 g. The extent to which the major institution has demonstrated a commitment to SOV alternatives.

 5. The provision of short-term parking spaces in excess of one hundred thirty-five percent (135%) of the minimum requirements established in subsection B2 may be permitted by the Director through preparation of a Transportation Management Program. In evaluating whether to allow more than one hundred thirty-five percent (135%) of the minimum, the Director, in consultation with ~~the Engineering Department~~Seattle Transportation and ~~the Municipality of~~ Metropolitan ~~Seattle~~~~(METRO)~~King County, shall consider evidence of parking demand and opportunities for alternative means of transportation. Factors to be considered shall include but are not necessarily limited to the criteria contained in subsection d of this section and the following:

 a. The nature of services provided by Major Institution uses which generate short-term parking demand; and

 b. The extent to which the major institution manages short-term parking to ensure its availability to meet short-term parking needs.

 Based on this review, the Director shall determine the amount of additional short-term parking to be permitted, if any.

 6. When an institution applies for a permit for development included in its master plan, it shall present evidence that it has made substantial progress toward the goals of its transportation management program, including the SOV goal. If substantial progress is not being made, as determined by the Director in consultation with ~~the Engineering Department~~Seattle Transportation and ~~METRO~~Metropolitan King County, the Director may:

 a. Require the institution to take additional steps to comply with the transportation management program; and/or

 b. Require measures in addition to those in the transportation management program which encourage alternative means of transportation for the travel generated by the proposed new development; and/or

 c. Deny the permit if previous efforts have not resulted in sufficient progress toward meeting the SOV goals of the institution.

 7. If one (1) major institution has acquired, merged with, or consolidated with another major institution, pursuant to Section 23.69.023, the new/surviving major institution shall prepare a new or revised transportation management program for the combined Major Institution Overlay District, according to the provisions of this section. The new/surviving major institution shall submit a draft transportation management program with any master use permit application for changes on any portion of the combined Major Institution Overlay District not already covered by an adopted master plan, or within one (1) year of the acquisition, merger or consolidation, whichever occurs first. The new or revised transportation management program shall be completed and approved by the Director as soon as is practicable, and at least before any master use permit, for which an application is filed more than one (1) year after the acquisition, merger or consolidation, is issued, for changes  on any portion of the combined Major Institution Overlay District not already covered by an adopted master plan; provided that this shall not affect the Director's authority to consider and mitigate traffic and transportation impacts under the SEPA policies and procedures in SMC Chapter 25.05.

 D. Development Standards for Parking.

 1. Long-term Parking.

 a. Carpools and vanpools shall be given guaranteed spaces in a more convenient location to the Major Institution uses they serve than SOV spaces, and shall be charged substantially less than the prevailing parking rates for SOVs.

 b. There shall be a charge for all non-carpool/vanpool long-term parking spaces.

 2. Bicycle Parking.

 a. Required bicycle parking shall be in a convenient location, covered in the same proportion as auto parking spaces and provided free of charge.

 b. Bicycle rack designs shall accommodate locking of the bicycle frame and both wheels with chains, cables, or U-shaped bicycle locks to an immovable rack or stall.

 3. Joint use or shared use of parking areas and facilities shall be encouraged if approved by the Director according to the standards of Section 23.54.020 G.

 4. The location and design of off-street parking and access to off-street parking shall be regulated according to the general standards of Chapter 23.54 and the specific standards of the underlying zone in which the parking is located.

 Chart A

 for Section 23.54.035

 [See this section in printed edition of the SMC. No

 amendments to the chart are made in this ordinance.]

 5.When a lot contains more than one (1) business establishment within the same category of low-, medium- or high- demand use, the square footage of the business establishments within the same category shall be added together in order to determine the number of required loading berths.

 B. Exception to Loading Requirements. For uses with less than sixteen thousand (16,000) square feet of gross floor area which provide a loading space on a street or alley, the loading berth requirements may be waived by the Director following a review by the Seattle ~~Engineering~~Transportation Department which finds that the street or alley berth is adequate.

 C. Standards for Loading Berths.

 1. Width and Clearance. Each loading berth shall be not less than ten feet (10') in width and shall provide not less than fourteen feet (14') vertical clearance.

 2. Length.

 a. High-demand Uses. Each loading berth for a high- demand use shall be a minimum of fifty-five feet (55') in length unless reduced by determination of the Director as provided at subsection C2c.

 b. Low- and Medium-demand Uses. Each loading berth for low- and medium-demand uses, except those uses identified in subsection C2d, shall be a minimum of thirty-five feet (35') in length unless reduced by determination of the Director as provided at subsection C2c.

 c. Exceptions to Loading Berth Length. Where the Director finds, after consulting with the property user, that site design and use of the property will not result in vehicles extending beyond the property line, loading berth lengths may be reduced to not less than the following:

 (i)High-demand Uses. Thirty-five feet (35') when access is from a collector arterial or local access street; and forty- five feet (45') when access is from a principal or minor arterial street;

 (ii) Low- and Medium-demand Uses. Twenty-five feet (25').

 d. Multi-purpose convenience stores, sales, service and rental of major durables, and specialty food stores may be required by the Director to increase the length of required loading berths; however, these uses shall not be required to provide loading berths in excess of fifty-five feet (55'). The review of loading berth length requirements for these uses shall focus on the size of vehicles that frequently serve the business and the frequency of loading activity that will extend beyond the lot line during daytime hours (six a.m. (6:00 a.m.) to six p.m. (6:00 p.m.. Large-truck loading occurring on a daily basis shall generally require longer loading berths; when such activity occurs on at least a weekly basis, it will be evaluated regarding the amount of traffic disruption and safety problems potentially created; such activity occurring on less than a weekly basis shall generally not require longer loading berths.

 3. For uses not listed in Chart A, the Director shall determine the loading berth length requirements. Loading demand and loading requirements for similar uses shall be considered.

 4. Maneuvering Space for Loading Berths. In addition to the length of the loading berth, additional maneuvering space may be required by the Director in the following cases:

 a. For any uses with over ten thousand (10,000) square feet of gross floor area with loading berth access from a principal or minor arterial street;

 b. For high-demand uses with over ten thousand (10,000) square feet of gross floor area with loading berth access from a collector arterial or local access street, especially if located across the street from another high-demand use. When required, the additional maneuvering space shall be designed and arranged to allow the most efficient use of all required loading berths by motor vehicles of the types typically employed by the activities served.

 A minimum of fifteen percent (15%) of the area included within the boundaries of the Manufacturing Center Overlay shall be landscaped according to a landscaping plan approved by the Council as part of the General Development Plan. The landscaped area may be reduced to a minimum of ten percent (10%) of the area for large sites exceeding eighty thousand (80,000) square feet if the project also provides additional recreational open space for employees. The Council shall use the following guidelines in reviewing the General Development Plan to establish sufficient landscaping conditions:

 A. Landscaping shall be used to establish a special character for the project and reinforce the cohesiveness of development, and shall follow guidelines A1 through A3:

 1. Landscaping along street rights-of-way should emphasize cohesiveness and establish a special identity for the project area. Generally, planting strips shall be provided, except when the Director determines that unusual circumstances make providing them infeasible. The planting strips shall be landscaped and planted with street trees according to ~~The City of Seattle Engineering Department~~ Seattle Transportation Tree Planting Standards. If it is not feasible to plant trees within the planting strip, they should be planted on private property at least two feet (2') from, but within five feet (5') of, the street property line.

 2. Landscaping shall be provided to mitigate impacts associated with additional height and density allowed for projects. Such mitigation may include buffering to protect less- intensive uses in abutting areas, view corridors to preserve views through the site, landscaped setbacks to reduce the presence of bulkier structures, and/or recreational open space to compensate for the greater working population associated with the increased densities allowed. Wherever possible, required landscaping and open space shall be integrated with adjacent landscaped areas to create the impression of large open spaces.

 3. Open spaces included in the project should provide sufficient landscaping to assure the opportunity for passive and/or active recreational activity. Recreational open space may be landscaped or occupied by sculpture, fountains or pools, benches or other recreational facilities such as game courts.

 B. Screening and landscaping shall be used to improve the visual character of the project as follows:

 1. Blank facades which are one hundred twenty feet (120') or more in length and twenty feet (20') or less from a street property line shall be screened to a height of at least six feet (6') by trellises and vining plants, or by trees or shrubs planted in front of the facade.

 2. All trash disposal areas shall have a solid screen that is at least as high as the material to be screened.

 3. Rooftop equipment shall be surrounded with a screen that is at least as high as the equipment to be screened. Screens shall be of a material and design that is compatible with the building.

 4. Screening and landscaping for surface parking areas shall be similar to the provisions of Chapter 23.49.020, Screening and Landscaping of Surface Parking Areas in Downtown Zones. Loading berths should be screened from view as much as possible along principal circulation routes within and bordering the project, either by locating them behind structures or through landscaping and screening on sides visible from the street.

 C. Curbs and sidewalks shall be required, unless the Director determines that unusual circumstances make providing them infeasible.

 D. Signs and lighting standards shall enhance the quality of the street environment and promote design cohesiveness within the project area.

 Section 209. SMC 23.69.032 is hereby amended as follows:

 2. In the Director's Report, a determination shall be made whether the proposed development and changes of the major institution are consistent with the framework policy of the City's Major Institution Policies, and whether the proposed development and changes represent a reasonable balance of the public benefits of development and change with the need to maintain livability and vitality of adjacent neighborhoods. Consideration shall be given to:

 a. The reasons for institutional growth and change, the public benefits resulting from the proposed new facilities and services, and the way in which the proposed development will serve the public purpose mission of the major institution; and

 b. The extent to which the growth and change will significantly harm the livability and vitality of the surrounding neighborhood.

 3. In the Director's Report, an assessment shall be made of the extent to which the major institution, with its proposed development and changes, will address the City's health policies and human services goals, including the provision of medical and educational services to low-income people.

 4. The Director's analysis and recommendation on the proposed master plan's development program component shall consider the following:

 a. The extent to which the institution's plans for development conform to the City's Major Institution Policy on concentration of Major Institution development on existing campuses or decentralization of Major Institution development. The Director may require existing or proposed facilities to be located beyond two thousand five hundred feet (2,500') of a Major Institution Overlay District boundary if the following conditions are present:

 (1)The facility or use does not require geographic proximity to the main institution, or

 Development potential within the boundaries of the applicable Major Institution Overlay District is needed for facilities more critical to the central mission of the major institution and increasing development potential would produce unacceptable adverse impacts on the surrounding area, and

 (2)Decentralization would reduce or eliminate undesirable adverse impacts on the surrounding neighborhood, including the need for expanding the boundary of the Major Institution Overlay District,

 b. The extent to which development is proposed to be located outside the Major Institution Overlay District and within two thousand five hundred feet (2,500') of the Overlay District boundary. To approve major institution development within two thousand five hundred feet (2,500') of the boundary of the Overlay District, except for development in a Downtown zone, which would result in floor area of major institution uses in excess of forty thousand (40,000) square feet or ten thousand (10,000) square feet on any one (1) site, the development shall:

 (1)Conform to the standards of the zone in which it is proposed to be located, and

 (2)Be compatible with other uses in the zone, and (3)Be essential to meeting the central mission of

 the major institution,

 c. The extent to which proposed development is phased in a manner which minimizes adverse impacts on the surrounding area. When public improvements are anticipated in the vicinity of proposed major institution development or expansion, coordination between the major institution development schedule and timing of public improvements shall be required;

 d. The extent to which historic structures which are designated on any federal, state or local historic or landmark register are proposed to be restored or reused. Any changes to designated Seattle Landmarks shall comply with the requirements of the Landmarks Preservation Ordinance. The major institution's advisory committee shall review any application to demolish a designated Seattle Landmark and shall submit comments to the Landmarks Preservation Board before any certificate of approval is issued.

 5. The Director's analysis and recommendation on the proposed master plan's development standards component shall be based on the following:

 a. The extent to which buffers such as topographic features, freeways or large open spaces are present or transitional height limits are proposed to mitigate the difference between the height and scale of existing or proposed major institution development and that of adjoining areas. Transition may also be achieved through the provision of increased setbacks, articulation of structure facades, limits on structure height or bulk or increased spacing between structures;

 b. The extent to which any structure is permitted to achieve the height limit of the Major Institution Overlay District. The Director shall evaluate the specified limits on structure height in relationship to the amount of Overlay District area permitted to be covered by structures, the impact of shadows on surrounding properties, the need for transition between the major institution and the surrounding area, and the need to protect views;

 c. The extent to which setbacks of major institution development at ground level or upper levels of a structure from the boundary of the Major Institution Overlay District or along public rights-of-way are provided for and the extent to which these setbacks provide a transition between major institution development and development in adjoining areas;

 d. The extent to which allowable lot coverage is consistent with permitted density and allows for adequate setbacks along public rights-of-way or boundaries of the Major Institution Overlay District. Coverage limits should insure that view corridors through major institution development are enhanced and that area for landscaping and open space is adequate to minimize the impact of major institution development within the Overlay District and on the surrounding area. Allowable lot coverage shall be specified on the basis of the entire Major Institution Overlay District or on a subarea basis within the Overlay District;

 e. The extent to which allowable density of development is specified either by the provision of floor area ratios (FAR) or by allowable gross floor area of development. Density limits shall be specified on the basis of the entire Major Institution Overlay District or on a subarea basis within the Overlay District. Allowable density shall consider the impacts of density of major institution development on vehicular and pedestrian circulation, adequacy of public facilities capacity of public infrastructure, and amount of open space provided. Density permitted shall not significantly impact the provision of neighborhood services to the surrounding area;

 f. The extent to which landscaping standards have been incorporated for required setbacks, for open space, along public rights-of-way, and for surface parking areas. Landscaping shall meet or exceed the amount of landscaping required by the underlying zoning. Trees shall be required along all public rights-of-way where feasible;

 g. The extent to which access to parking, loading and service areas is provided from an arterial street;

 h. The extent to which the provisions for pedestrian circulation maximize connections between public pedestrian rights-of- way within and adjoining the Major Institution Overlay District in a convenient manner. Pedestrian connections between neighborhoods separated by major institution development shall be emphasized and enhanced;

 i. The extent to which open space maintains the patterns and character of the area in which the major institution is located and is desirable in location and access for use by patients, students, visitors and staff of the major institution. If proposed open-space areas are deemed to be inadequate to serve the needs of the major institution, the Director may require that the major institution contribute to the provision of public open space nearby;

 j. The extent to which open space, though not required to be physically accessible to the public, is visually accessible to the public;

 k. The extent to which the proposed development standards provide for the protection of scenic views and/or views of landmark structures. Scenic views and/or views of landmark structures along existing public rights-of-way or those proposed for vacation may be preserved. New view corridors shall be considered where potential enhancement of views through the major institution or of scenic amenities may be enhanced. To maintain or provide for view corridors the Director may require, but not be limited to, the alternate spacing or placement of structures or grade-level openings in structures. The institution shall not be required to reduce the combined gross floor area of proposed buildings in order to protect views other than those protected under City laws of general applicability.

 6. The Director's report shall specify all measures or actions necessary to be taken by the major institution to mitigate adverse impacts of major institution development that are specified in the proposed master plan.

 7. The Director shall make a recommendation on each of the issues highlighted in the advisory committee's comments on the draft Director's Report as being unresolved or inadequately addressed. In addition, on those issues where the Director's recommendation differs from the advisory committee's comments, the Director shall include written justification for the Director's recommendation.

 F. Advisory Committee Report.

 1. The advisory committee shall prepare a written report of its findings and recommendations on the final master plan and on the final Director's Report. The advisory committee report shall include, in addition to its recommendations, the public comments it received. The document may incorporate minority reports.

The TMP shall include measures likely to achieve the goals for the proportion of single occupant vehicle (SOV) trips identified below. These goals are a fifteen percent (15%) reduction in the proportion of SOV trips by 1995, twenty-five percent (25%) by 1997, and thirty-five percent (35%) by 1999, from the 1990 SOV baseline rate of eighty-five percent (85%) for commute trips made by all students and employees working in the Northgate area (see Table 23.71.018 A).

 1. For purposes of measuring attainment of the SOV goal, the proportion of SOV trips shall be calculated for the p.m. hour in which an applicant expects the largest number of vehicle trips to be made by employees and students at the site (the p.m. peak hour of the generator). The proportion of SOV trips shall be calculated by dividing the total number of employees and students using a SOV to make a trip during the expected peak hour by the total number of employee and student person trips during the expected peak hour.

 2. Compliance with this section does not supplant the responsibility of any employer to comply with Seattle's Commute Trip Reduction (CTR) Ordinance.

 Table 23.71.018 A

 Commercial/

 Year/Goals Institutional Residential

 January 1, 1995 72% 62%

 January 1, 1997 64% 59%

 January 1, 2000 55% 55%

 B. The owner of any site who proposes multifamily substantial development which is expected to generate fifty (50) or more vehicle trips in any one (1) p.m. hour shall prepare and implement a TMP. The TMP shall include measures likely to achieve goals for the proportion of SOV trips. These goals are a ten percent (10%) reduction in the proportion of SOV trips by 1995, fifteen percent (15%) by 1997 and twenty percent (20%) by 1999, from the 1990 SOV baseline rate (sixty- nine percent (69%) SOV) for commute trips by all residents living in the Northgate area (see Table 23.71.018 A).

 For purposes of measuring attainment of the SOV goal, the proportion of SOV trips shall be calculated for the p.m. hour in which an applicant expects the largest number of vehicle trips to be made by residents of the site (the p.m. peak hour of the generator). The proportion of SOV trips shall be calculated by dividing the total number of residential trips made by SOV during the expected peak hour by the total number of residential person trips.

 C. Each owner subject to the requirements of this section shall prepare a TMP as described in rules promulgated by the Director, as part of the requirements for obtaining a master use permit.

 D. The TMP shall be approved by the Director if, after consulting with ~~the Seattle Engineering Department~~Seattle Transportation, the Director determines that the TMP measures are likely to achieve the SOV goals.

 E. The owner of each property subject to this implementation guideline shall submit an annual progress report to the Director of ~~Engineering~~Transportation, who will advise the Director of DCLU on compliance. The progress report shall contain:

 1. The number of full and part-time employees, students and/or residents at a site during the peak hour;

 2. A summary of the total p.m. peak hour vehicle trips generated by the site, including employees, students and residents;

 3. A description of any programs, incentives, or activities or other measures targeted to reduce vehicle trips, in which employees, students or residents at the site participate;

 4. The number of people participating in the TMP measures;

 5. The peak hour proportion of SOV trips of the employees, students, and/or residents.

 F. ~~The Seattle Engineering Department~~Seattle Transportation shall monitor compliance with the requirements of this section. If monitoring shows that the owner has not implemented the TMP measures or has not made sufficient progress toward achieving the TMP goals, the Director of ~~Engineering~~Transportation may recommend that the Director:

 1. Require modifications to the TMP program measures; and/or

 2. Pursue enforcement action pursuant to the Land Use Code.

 G. After approval of a TMP and issuance of a master use

 permit as prescribed in subsections C and D of this section, if the owner applies for a master use permit for additional development, before approving the new master use permit, the Director, after consulting with the Director of ~~Engineering~~Transportation , shall review the implementation of the TMP. If substantial progress has not been made in achieving the goal for the proportion of SOV trips, the Director may:

 1. Require the applicant to revise the TMP to include additional measures in order to achieve compliance with the TMP goal before the issuance of a permit; and/or

 2. Require measures in addition to those in the TMP that encourage alternative means of transportation for the proposed new development; and/or

 3. Deny the permit if the Director determines that the owner has failed to make a good- faith effort to implement the TMP; or

 4. Determine that a revised or new program is not needed, and that the permit can be issued without changes to the existing TMP.

 H. Compliance. To comply with this section, the owner of a site subject to the requirement for a TMP, must demonstrate that he or she has an approved TMP, has submitted the required annual reports, and has succeeded in accomplishing one (1) of the two (2) following objectives:

 1. That the owner has implemented the measures contained in the TMP for the development project; and/or

 2. That the owner has met the goal for SOV trips specified in subsection A of this section.

 Failure to comply with the provisions of this section is a violation of the Land Use Code. The penalty for each violation is Two Hundred Fifty Dollars ($250.00) per day.

 I. A fund shall be established in the City's General Fund to receive revenue from fines for violations of this section. Revenue from fines shall be allocated to activities or incentives to reduce vehicle trips in the Northgate area. The Director of ~~SED~~ Transportation shall recommend to the Mayor and City Council how these funds should be allocated.

 J. ~~SED~~Seattle Transportation and DCLU shall prepare a Director's Rule explaining how each department shall implement this section.

 A. Air Quality.

 1. Policy Background.

 a. Air pollution can be damaging to human health, plants and animals, visibility, aesthetics, and the overall quality of life.

 b. Seattle's air quality is adversely affected primarily by vehicular emissions which create "hot spots" and nonattainment areas (such as downtown Seattle, Northgate, and the University District) that are identifiable through quarterly monitoring.

 c. Seattle's air quality is also affected by particulates from industries, power plants, and wood stoves, the burning of toxics or wastes, and other emissions, including odor impacts.

 d. Federal auto emission controls, the state inspection/maintenance program, and public transportation improvements are the primary means of mitigating air quality impacts from motor vehicles.

 e. The Puget Sound Air Pollution Control Agency is responsible for monitoring air quality in the Seattle area, setting standards and regulating development to achieve regional air quality goals.

 f. Federal, state and regional regulations and programs cannot always anticipate or adequately mitigate adverse air quality impacts.

 2. Policies.

 a. It is the City's policy to minimize or prevent adverse air quality impacts.

 b. For any project proposal which has a substantial adverse effect on air quality, the decisionmaker shall, in consultation with appropriate agencies with expertise, assess the probable effect of the impact and the need for mitigating measures."Nonattainment areas" identified by the Puget Sound Air Pollution Control Agency shall be given special consideration.

 c. Subject to the Overview Policy set forth in SMC 25.05.665, if the decisionmaker makes a written finding that the applicable federal, state and/or regional regulations did not anticipate or are inadequate to address the particular impact(s) of the project, the decisionmaker may condition or deny the proposal to mitigate its adverse impacts.

 d. Mitigating measures may include but are not limited to:

 i. The use of alternative technologies, including toxic air control technologies;

 ii. Controlling dust sources with paving, landscaping, or other means;

 iii. Berming, buffering and screening;

 iv. Landscaping and/or retention of existing vegetation; and

 v. A reduction in size or scope of the project or operation.

 B. Construction Impacts.

 a. For many projects, the construction process itself creates temporary adverse impacts on the site and the surrounding area.

 b. Seattle's Street Use Ordinance, 1 Building Code 2 and Environmentally Critical Areas Ordinance2A are intended to address many of the impacts caused by the construction process. The codes may not, however, adequately address all construction impacts such as those relating to pedestrian flow and safety due to sidewalk and street closures, excessive mud and dust, noise, drainage, increased truck traffic, erosion, water quality degradation, and habitat disruption.

 2. Policies.

 a. It is the City's policy to minimize or prevent temporary adverse impacts associated with construction activities.

 b. The decisionmaker may require, as part of the environmental review of a project, an assessment of noise, drainage, erosion, water quality degradation, habitat disruption, pedestrian circulation and transportation, and mud and dust impacts likely to result from the construction phase.

 c. Based on such assessments, the decisionmaker may, subject to the Overview Policy set forth in SMC Section 25.05.665 , condition or deny a project to mitigate adverse impacts of the construction process.

 d. Noise. Mitigating measures to address adverse noise impacts during construction include, but are not limited to:

 i. Limiting the hours of construction;

 ii. Specifying the time and duration of loud noise;

 iii. Specifying a preferred type of construction equipment; and

 iv. Requiring sound buffering and barriers.

 e. Drainage. Mitigating measures to address adverse drainage impacts during construction may include, but are not limited to:

 i. Sedimentation traps and filters;

 ii. Sedimentation tanks or ponds;

 iii. Oil separators;

 iv. Retention facilities;

 v. Maintenance programs;

 vi. Performance bonds; and

 vii. Nondisturbance areas.

 f. Pedestrian Circulation. Mitigating measures to address adverse impacts relating to pedestrian circulation during construction may include, but are not limited to:

 i. Covered sidewalks or alternate safe, convenient and adequate pedestrian routes; and

 ii. Limits on the duration of disruptions to pedestrian flow.

 g. Transportation. Mitigating measures to address transportation impacts during construction may include, but are not limited to:

 i. A construction phase transportation plan which addresses ingress and egress of construction equipment and construction worker vehicles at the project site;

 ii. Traffic control and street maintenance in the vicinity of the construction site;

 iii. Rerouting of public vehicular and pedestrian circulation in the vicinity of the construction site;

 iv. Providing a temporary High Occupancy Vehicle (HOV) incentive program for construction workers at the site to reduce the number of their vehicles taking parking places in the vicinity of the construction site; and

 v. HOV discounts for members of the public who were displaced from a traditional parking area by the construction activity.

 C. Drainage.

 1. Policy Background.

 a. Property development and redevelopment often create increased volumes and rates of stormwater runoff, which may cause property damage, safety hazards, nuisance problems and water quality degradation.

 b. Pollution, mechanical damage, excessive flows, and other conditions in drainage basins will increase the rate of down- cutting and/or the degree of turbidity, siltation, habitat destruction, and other forms of pollution in wetlands, riparian corridors and lakes. They may also reduce low flows or low water levels to a level which endangers aquatic or benthic life within these wetlands, riparian corridors and lakes.

 c. The aesthetic quality and educational value of the water and watercourses, as well as the suitability of waters for contact recreation and wildlife habitat, may be destroyed.

 d. Authority provided through the Grading and Drainage Control Ordinance 3 and the Environmentally Critical Areas Ordinance is intended to achieve mitigation of drainage impacts in most cases, although these ordinances may not anticipate or eliminate all impacts.

 2. Policies.

 a. It is the City's policy to protect wetlands, riparian corridors, lakes, drainage basins, wildlife habitat, slopes, and other property from adverse drainage impacts.

 b. The decisionmaker may condition or deny projects to mitigate their adverse drainage impacts consistent with the Overview Policy set forth in SMC Section 25.05.665 ; provided, that in addition to projects which meet one (1) or more of the threshold criteria set forth in the Overview Policy, the following may be conditioned or denied:

 i. Projects located in environmentally sensitive areas and areas tributary to them;

 ii. Projects located in areas where downstream drainage facilities are known to be inadequate; and

 iii. Projects draining into streams identified by the State Department of Fisheries or Wildlife as bearing anadromous fish.

 c. To mitigate adverse drainage impacts associated with the projects identified in the policy set forth in subsection C2 above, projects may be required to provide drainage control measures designed to a higher standard than the design storm specified in the Grading and Drainage Control Ordinance 3 and the Environmentally Critical Areas Ordinance.2A Mitigating measures may include, but are not limited to:

 i. Reducing the size or scope of the project;

 ii. Requiring landscaping and/or retention of existing vegetation;

 iii. Requiring additional drainage control or drainage improvements either on or off site; and

 iv. Soil stabilization measures.

 D. Earth.

 1. Policy Background.

 a. Property development and redevelopment sometimes contribute to landslides, accelerated soil creep, settlement and subsidence, and abnormal erosion. They may also be subject to seismic hazards

 such as strong ground motion and liquefaction.

 b. The Grading and Drainage Control Ordinance 3 was specifically developed to prevent or minimize impacts resulting from earth fills and excavations and the Environmentally Critical Areas Ordinance 2A was developed to minimize impacts resulting from activity in environmentally critical areas; however, these ordinances may not anticipate or adequately mitigate such impacts in all cases.

 c. Drainage impacts, which are closely related to earth movement hazards, are addressed separately in subsection C of these policies.

 2. Policies.

 a. It is the City's policy to protect life and property from loss or damage by landslides, strong ground motion and soil liquefaction, accelerated soil creep, settlement and subsidence, abnormal erosion, and other hazards related to earth movement and instability.

 b. The decisionmaker may condition or deny projects to mitigate impacts related to earth movement or earth instability consistent with the Overview Policy set forth in SMC Section 25.05.665 ; provided, that in addition to projects which meet one (1) or more of the threshold criteria set forth in the Overview Policy, projects located in environmentally sensitive areas and areas tributary to them may be conditioned or denied.

 c. Mitigating measures may include, but are not limited to:

 i. Reducing the size or scope of the operation or project;

 ii. Limiting the duration of the project or the hours of operation;

 iii. Requiring landscaping, the retention of existing vegetation or revegetation of the site;

 iv. Requiring additional drainage-control measures or drainage facilities;

 v. Requiring water quality and erosion controls on or off site to control earth movement; and

 vi. Requiring additional stabilization measures.

 E. Energy.

 1. Policy Background.

 a. The City's Energy Code 4 is intended to regulate the design of buildings for adequate thermal resistance and low air leakage. It requires the design and selection of mechanical, electrical, water, heating and illumination systems which will enable the efficient use of energy. Application of the Energy Code results in projects which achieve substantial energy savings.

 b. Industrial processes and manufacturing activities may have significant adverse energy impacts that are not addressed by the Seattle Energy Code.4

 c. Energy conservation measures may conflict, in some cases, with the goal of preserving structures of historical significance.

 2. Policies.

 a. It is the City's policy to promote energy conservation and the most efficient possible use and production of energy.

 b. All major projects shall be required to analyze and disclose their energy impacts by fuel type and end-use.

 c. For projects with significant adverse energy impacts which involve activities not covered by the Energy Code,4 such as heavy industrial activities, or which meet one (1) or more of the conditions set forth in the Overview Policy SMC 25.05.665 D, the decisionmaker may require that the environmental review include a reasonable assessment of alternatives and mitigating measures.

 d. Subject to the Overview Policy set forth in SMC 25.05.665 , the decisionmaker may condition or deny projects with significant adverse impacts relating to the use of the electrical energy in order to mitigate their adverse impacts to the City's electric utility system. Mitigating measures may include, but are not limited to conservation measures such as the use of alternative technologies.

 e. In applying these policies to the rehabilitation of structures with historical significance, the decisionmaker shall be flexible in the application of energy conservation measures which may be in conflict with historical preservation goals and shall attempt to achieve a balance in meeting these competing objectives.

 F. Environmental Health.

 1. Policy Background.

 a. The use, discharge, disposal, emission or application of toxic or hazardous materials may pose hazards to human health and to plants, animals and ecological systems. Hazardous materials include such things as pesticides, herbicides, and electromagnetic transmissions.

 b. Federal, state and regional regulations are the primary means of mitigating risks associated with hazardous and toxic materials.

 c. Federal, state and regional regulations cannot always anticipate or eliminate adverse impacts from hazardous materials and transmissions. Public knowledge regarding such hazardous materials and transmissions may develop more quickly than regulations can react and be implemented.

 2. Policies.

 a. It is the City's policy to minimize or prevent adverse impacts resulting from toxic or hazardous materials and transmissions.

 b. For all proposed projects involving the use, treatment, transport, storage, disposal, emission, or application of toxic or hazardous chemicals, materials, wastes or transmissions, the decisionmaker shall, in consultation with appropriate agencies with expertise, assess the extent of potential adverse impacts and the need for mitigation.

 c. Subject to the Overview Policy set forth in SMC 25.05.665 , if the decisionmaker makes a written finding that applicable federal, state and regional laws and regulations did not anticipate or do not adequately address the adverse impacts of a proposed project, the project may be conditioned or denied to mitigate its adverse impacts. Mitigating measures may include, but are not limited to:

 i. Use of an alternative technology;

 ii. Reduction in the size or scope of a project or operation;

 iii. Limits on the time and/or duration of operation; and

 iv. Alternative routes of transportation.

 G. Height, Bulk and Scale.

 1. Policy Background.

 a. The City's adopted land use policies 5 are intended to provide for smooth transition between industrial, commercial, and residential areas, to preserve the character of individual city neighborhoods and to reinforce natural topography. These land use policies are set forth in SMC Chapter 23.12 .

 b. The Land Use Code ( Title 23 ) which implements these policies controls height, bulk and scale but cannot anticipate or address all substantial adverse impacts resulting from incongruous height, bulk and scale. For example, unanticipated adverse impacts may occur when a project is located on a site with unusual topographic features or on a site which is substantially larger than the prevalent platting pattern in an area.

 c. Whenever new land use policies are adopted, adverse impacts may result when height, bulk and scale permitted by previously adopted zoning conflicts with the new land use policies.

 2. Policies.

 a. It is the City's policy that the height, bulk and scale of development projects should be reasonably compatible with the general character of development anticipated by the adopted land use policies set forth in SMC Chapter 23.12 for the area in which they are located, and to provide for a reasonable transition between areas of less intensive zoning and more intensive zoning.

 b. Subject to the Overview Policy set forth in SMC Section 25.05.665 , the decision-maker may condition or deny a project to mitigate the adverse impacts of substantially incompatible height, bulk and scale. Mitigating measures may include but are not limited to:

 i. Limiting the height of the development;

 ii. Modifying the bulk of the development;

 iii. Modifying the development's facade including but not limited to color and finish material;

 iv. Reducing the number or size of accessory structures or relocating accessory structures including but not limited to towers, railings, and antennae;

 v. Repositioning the development on the site; and

 vi. Modifying or requiring setbacks, screening, landscaping or other techniques to offset the appearance of incompatible height, bulk and scale.

 c. The Citywide Design Guidelines (and any Council- approved, neighborhood design guidelines) are intended to mitigate the same adverse height, bulk and scale impacts addressed in these policies. A project that is approved pursuant to the design review process shall be presumed to comply with these height, bulk and scale policies. This presumption may be rebutted only by clear and convincing evidence that height, bulk and scale impacts documented through environmental review have not been adequately mitigated. Any additional mitigation imposed by the decisionmaker pursuant to these height, bulk and scale policies on projects that have undergone design review shall comply with design guidelines applicable to the project.

 H. Historic Preservation.

 1. Policy Background.

 a. Historic buildings, special historic districts, and sites of archaeological significance are found within Seattle. The preservation of these buildings, districts and sites is important to the retention of a living sense and appreciation of the past.

 b. Historic sites, structures, districts and archaeological sites may be directly or indirectly threatened by development or redevelopment projects.

 c. Historic buildings are protected by the Landmarks Preservation Ordinance, 6 as administered by the Landmarks Preservation Board. However, not all sites and structures meeting the criteria for historic landmark status have been designated yet.

 d. Special districts have been established to protect certain areas which are unique in their historical and cultural significance, including for example Pike Place Market, Pioneer Square and the International District. These areas are subject to development controls and project review by special district review boards.

 e. Archaeologically significant sites present a unique problem because protection of their integrity may, in some cases, eliminate any economic opportunity on the site.

 2. Policies.

 a. It is the City's policy to maintain and preserve significant historic sites and structures and to provide the opportunity for analysis of archaeological sites.

 b. For projects involving structures or sites which have been designated as historic landmarks, compliance with the Landmarks Preservation Ordinance 6 shall constitute compliance with the policy set forth in subsection H2a above.

 c. For projects involving structures or sites which are not yet designated as historical landmarks but which appear to meet the criteria for designation, the decisionmaker or any interested person may refer the site or structure to the Landmarks Preservation Board for consideration. If the Board approves the site or structure for nomination as an historic landmark, consideration of the site or structure for designation as an historic landmark and application of controls and incentives shall proceed as provided by the Landmarks Preservation Ordinance.6 If the project is rejected for nomination, the project shall not be conditioned or denied for historical preservation purposes, except pursuant to paragraphs d or e of this subsection.

 d. When a project is proposed adjacent to or across the street from a designated site or structure, the decisionmaker shall refer the proposal to the City's Historic Preservation Officer for an assessment of any adverse impacts on the designated landmark and for comments on possible mitigating measures. Mitigation may be required to insure the compatibility of the proposed project with the color, material and architectural character of the designated landmark and to reduce impacts on the character of the landmark's site. Subject to the Overview Policy set forth in SMC Section 25.05.665 , mitigating measures may be required and are limited to the following:

 i.Sympathetic facade treatment;

 ii.Sympathetic street treatment;

 iii.Sympathetic design treatment; and

 iv.Reconfiguration of the project and/or relocation of the project on the project site; provided, that mitigating measures shall not include reductions in a project's gross floor area.

 e. On sites with potential archaeological significance, the decisionmaker may require an assessment of the archaeological potential of the site. Subject to the criteria of the Overview Policy set forth in SMC Section 25.05.665 , mitigating measures which may be required to mitigate adverse impacts to an archaeological site include, but are not limited to:

 i. Relocation of the project on the site;

 ii. Providing markers, plaques, or recognition of discovery;

 iii. Imposing a delay of as much as ninety (90) days (or more than ninety (90) days for extraordinary circumstances) to allow archaeological artifacts and information to be analyzed; and

 iv. Excavation and recovery of artifacts.

 I. Housing.

 1. Policy Background. Demolition or rehabilitation of low- rent housing units or conversion of housing for other uses can cause both displacement of low-income persons and reduction in the supply of housing.

 2. Policies.

 a. It is the City's policy to encourage preservation of housing opportunities, especially for low income persons, and to ensure that persons displaced by redevelopment are relocated.

 b. Proponents of projects shall disclose the on-site and off-site impacts of the proposed projects upon housing, with particular attention to low-income housing.

 c. Compliance with legally valid City ordinance provisions relating to housing relocation, demolition and conversion shall constitute compliance with this housing policy.

 d. Housing preservation shall be an important consideration in the development of the City's public projects and programs. The City shall give high priority to limiting demolition of low-income housing in the development of its own facilities.

 J. Land Use.

 1. Policy Background.

 a. The City has adopted land use policies 5 and code which are designed, in part, to minimize or prevent impacts resulting from incompatible land uses. These land use policies are set forth in SMC Chapter 23.12 .

 b. The adopted Land Use Code ( Title 23 ) cannot identify or anticipate all possible uses and all potential land use impacts.

 c. When land use policy changes are adopted, adverse land use impacts may result when a proposed project includes uses which may be consistent with the applicable zoning requirements but are in conflict with the new land use policies.

 d. Adverse cumulative land use impacts may result when a particular use or uses permitted under the zoning code occur in an area to such an extent that they foreclose opportunities for higher- priority,

 preferred uses called for in the City's land use policies.

 e. Density-related impacts of development are addressed under the policies set forth in subsections G (height, bulk and scale), M (parking), R (traffic) and O (public services and facilities) and are not addressed under this policy.

 2. Policies.

 a. It is the City's policy to ensure that proposed uses in development projects are reasonably compatible with surrounding uses and are consistent with any applicable, adopted City land use policies for the area in which the project is located.

 b. Subject to the Overview Policy set forth in SMC Section 25.05.665 , the decisionmaker may condition or deny any project to mitigate adverse land use impacts associated with a proposed project and achieve consistency with the applicable City land use policies set forth in SMC Chapter 23.12 and with the environmentally critical areas policies.

 K. Light and Glare.

 1. Policy Background.

 a. Development projects sometimes include lighting and/or reflective surface materials which can adversely affect motorists, pedestrians, and the surrounding area. Such adverse impacts may be mitigated by alternative lighting techniques and surface materials.

 b. The City's Land Use Code specifically addresses the issue of light and glare control associated with commercial and industrial projects.

 2. Policies.

 a. It is the City's policy to minimize or prevent hazards and other adverse impacts created by light and glare.

 b. If a proposed project may create adverse impacts due to light and glare, the decisionmaker shall assess the impacts and the need for mitigation.

 c. Subject to the Overview Policy set forth in SMC Section 25.05.665 , the decisionmaker may condition or deny a proposed project to mitigate its adverse impacts due to light and glare.

 d. Mitigating measures may include, but are not limited to:

 i. Limiting the reflective qualities of surface materials that can be used in the development;

 ii. Limiting the area and intensity of illumination;

 iii. Limiting the location or angle of illumination;

 iv. Limiting the hours of illumination; and

 v. Providing landscaping.

 L. Noise.

 1. Policy Background.

 a. Noise may be injurious to the public health, safety and welfare. It may have adverse impacts on commerce; the use, value and enjoyment of property; sleep and repose; and the physiological and

 psychological well-being of those who live and work in Seattle.

 b. The Noise Control Ordinance 7 effectively addresses most noise impacts. However, some noise impacts are not addressed by the Noise Control Ordinance, such as the continual or repetitive noise of a project's operation.

 c. The Land Use Code addresses noise generators and noise impacts associated with commercial and industrial uses. However, all noise impacts may not be anticipated and mitigated by the Land Use Code.

 2. Policies.

 a. It is the City's policy to minimize or prevent adverse noise impacts resulting from new development or uses.

 b. The decisionmaker may require, as part of the environmental review of a project, an assessment of noise impacts likely to result from the project.

 c. Based in part on such assessments, and in consultation with appropriate agencies with expertise,

 the decisionmaker shall assess the extent of adverse impacts and the need for mitigation.

 d. Subject to the Overview Policy set forth in SMC Section 25.05.665 , the decisionmaker may condition or deny a proposal to mitigate its adverse noise impacts.

 e. Mitigating measures may include, but are not limited to:

 i.Use of an alternative technology;

 ii.Reduction in the size or scope of a project or operation;

 iii.Limits on the time and/or duration of operation; and

 iv.Requiring buffering, landscaping, or other techniques to reduce noise impacts off-site.

 M. Parking.

 1. Policy Background.

 a. Increased parking demand associated with development projects may adversely affect the availability of parking in an area.

 b. Parking policies designed to mitigate most parking impacts and to accommodate most of the cumulative effects of future projects on parking are included in the City's land use policies 5 and implemented through the City's Land Use Code. However, in some neighborhoods, due to inadequate off-street parking, streets are unable to absorb any additional parking spillover. The policies recognize that the cost of providing additional parking may have an adverse effect on the affordability of housing.

 2. Policies.

 a. It is the City's policy to minimize or prevent adverse parking impacts associated with development projects.

 b. Subject to the overview and cumulative effects policies set forth in SMC Section 25.05.665 and SMC Section 25.05.670 , the decisionmaker may condition a project to mitigate the effects of development in an area on parking; provided, that no SEPA authority is provided to mitigate the impact of development on parking availability in the downtown zones; provided further, that with the exception of the Alki area, as described in subsection 2c below, parking impact mitigation for multi-family development may be required only where on-street parking is at capacity as defined by ~~the Engineering Department~~Seattle Transportation or where the development itself would cause on-street parking to reach capacity as so defined.

 c. For the Alki area, as identified on Exhibit 2,9 a higher number of spaces per unit than is required by SMC Section 23.54.015 may be required to mitigate the adverse parking impacts of specific multi-family projects. Projects that generate a greater need for parking and that are located in places where the street cannot absorb that need C for example, because of proximity to the Alki Beach Park C may be required to provide additional parking spaces to meet the building's actual need. In determining that need, the size of the development project, the size of the units and the number of bedrooms in the units shall be considered.

 d. Parking impact mitigation for projects outside of downtown zones may include but is not limited to:

 i. Transportation management programs;

 ii. Parking management and allocation plans;

 iii. Incentives for the use of alternatives to single- occupancy vehicles, such as transit pass subsidies,

 parking fees, and provision of bicycle parking space;

 iv. Increased parking ratios; and

 v. Reduced development densities to the extent that it can be shown that reduced parking spillover is likely to result; provided, that parking impact mitigation for multi-family development may not include reduction in development density.

 N. Plants and Animals.

 1. Policy Background.

 a. Many species of birds, mammals, fish, and other classes of animals and plants living in the urban environments are of aesthetic, educational, ecological and in some cases economic value.

 b. Local wildlife populations are threatened by habitat loss through destruction and fragmentation of living and breeding areas and travelways, and by the reduction of habitat diversity.

 c. Substantial protection of wildlife habitats and travel corridors within the City is provided by the Seattle Shoreline Master Program.

 2. Policies.

 a. It is the City's policy to minimize or prevent the loss of wildlife habitat and other vegetation which have substantial aesthetic, educational, ecological, and/or economic value. A high priority shall be given to the preservation and protection of special habitat types. Special habitat types include, but are not limited to, wetlands and associated areas (such as upland nesting areas), and spawning, feeding, or nesting sites. A high priority shall also be given to meeting the needs of state and federal threatened, endangered, and sensitive species of both plants and animals.

 b. For projects which are proposed within an identified plant or wildlife habitat or travelway, the decisionmaker shall assess the extent of adverse impacts and the need for mitigation.

 c. When the decisionmaker finds that a proposed project would reduce or damage rare, uncommon, unique or exceptional plant or wildlife habitat, wildlife travelways, or habitat diversity for species (plants or animals) of substantial aesthetic, educational, ecological or economic value, the decisionmaker may condition or deny the project to mitigate its adverse impacts. Such conditioning or denial is permitted whether or not the project meets the criteria of the Overview Policy set forth in SMC Section 25.05.665 ; provided, that for any project subject to the City's Shoreline Master Program, the Overview Policy set forth in SMC Section 25.05.665 shall apply.

 d. Mitigating measures may include but are not limited to:

 i. Relocation of the project on the site;

 ii. Reducing the size or scale of the project;

 iii. Preservation of specific on-site habitats, such as trees or vegetated areas;

 iv. Limitations on the uses allowed on the site;

 v. Limitations on times of operation during periods significant to the affected species (i.e., spawning season, mating season, etc.); and

 vi. Landscaping and/or retention of existing vegetation.

 O. Public Services and Facilities.

 1. Policy Background. A single development, though otherwise consistent with zoning regulations, may create excessive demands upon existing public services and facilities. "Public services and facilities" in this context includes facilities such as sewers, storm drains, solid waste disposal facilities, parks, schools, and streets and services such as transit, solid waste collection, public health services, and

 police and fire protection, provided by either a public agency or private entity.

 2. Policies.

 a. It is the City's policy to minimize or prevent adverse impacts to existing public services and facilities.

 b. The decisionmaker may require, as part of the environmental review of a project, a reasonable assessment of the present and planned condition and capacity of public services and facilities to serve

 the area affected by the proposal.

 c. Based upon such analyses, a project which would result in adverse impacts on existing public services and facilities may be conditioned or denied to lessen its demand for services and facilities, or required to improve or add services and/or facilities for the public, whether or not the project meets the criteria of the Overview Policy set forth in SMC 25.05.665 .

 P. Public View Protection.

 1. Policy Background.

 a. Seattle has a magnificent natural setting of greenery, mountains, and water; visual amenities and opportunities are an integral part of the City's environmental quality.

 b. The City has developed particular sites for the public's enjoyment of views of mountains, water and skyline and has many scenic routes and other public places where such views enhance one's experience.

 c. Obstruction of public views may occur when a proposed structure is located in close proximity to the street property line, when development occurs on lots situated at the foot of a street that terminates

 or changes direction because of a shift in the street grid pattern, or when development along a street creates a continuous wall separating the street from the view.

 d. Authority provided through the Landmarks Preservation Ordinance 6 is intended to preserve sites and structures which reflect significant elements of the City's historic heritage and to designate and

 regulate such sites and structures as historic landmarks.

 e. The adopted Downtown Land Use Policies and Code provide for the preservation of specified view corridors through setback requirements and policies for the use of street space.

 f. Adopted Land Use Codes attempt to protect private views through height and bulk controls and

 other zoning regulations but it is impractical to protect private views through project-specific review.

 2. Policies.

 a. i. It is the City's policy to protect public views of significant natural and human-made features: Mount Rainier, the Olympic and Cascade Mountains, the downtown skyline, and major bodies of water including Puget Sound, Lake Washington, Lake Union and the Ship Canal, from public places consisting of the specified viewpoints, parks, scenic routes, and view corridors, identified in Attachment 1. (Attachment 1 is located at the end of this Section 25.05.675 .)

 ii. The decisionmaker may condition or deny a proposal to eliminate or reduce its adverse impacts on designated public views, whether or not the project meets the criteria of the Overview Policy set forth in SMC 25.05.665 ; provided that downtown projects may be conditioned or denied only when public views from outside of downtown would be blocked as a result of a change in the street grid pattern.

 b. i. It is the City's policy to protect public views of historic landmarks designated by the Landmarks Preservation Board which, because of their prominence of location or contrasts of siting, age, or scale, are easily identifiable visual features of their neighborhood or the City and contribute to the distinctive quality or identity of their neighborhood or the City.

 ii. A proposed project may be conditioned or denied to mitigate view impacts on historic landmarks, whether or not the project meets the criteria of the Overview Policy set forth in SMC Section 25.05.665 .

 c. Mitigating measures may include, but are not limited to:

 i. Requiring a change in the height of the development;

 ii. Requiring a change in the bulk of the development;

 iii. Requiring a redesign of the profile of the development;

 iv. Requiring on-site view corridors or requiring enhancements to off-site view corridors;

 v. Relocating the project on the site;

 vi. Requiring a reduction or rearrangement of walls, fences or plant material; and

 vii. Requiring a reduction or rearrangement of accessory structures including, but not limited to towers, railings and antennae.

 Q. Shadows on Open Spaces.

 1. Policy Background.

 a. Access to sunlight, especially in Seattle's climate, is an amenity of public open spaces.

 b. It is possible to design and locate structures to minimize the extent to which they block light from public open spaces.

 c. The Downtown Land Use Code provides some protections against shadow impacts created by development in downtown. However, due to the scale of development permitted in downtown, it is not practical to prevent such blockage at all public open spaces downtown.

 d. The City's Land Use Code ( Title 23 ) attempts to protect private property from undue shadow impacts through height, bulk and setback controls, but it is impractical to protect private properties from shadows through project-specific review.

 2. Policies. It is the City's policy to minimize or prevent light blockage and the creation of shadows on open spaces most used by the public.

 a. Areas outside of downtown to be protected are as follows:

 i. Publicly owned parks;

 ii. Public schoolyards;

 iii. Private schools which allow public use of schoolyards during non-school hours; and

 iv. Publicly owned street ends in shoreline areas.

 b. Areas in downtown where shadow impacts may be mitigated are:

 i. Freeway Park;

 ii. Westlake Park and Plaza;

 iii. Market (Steinbrueck) Park;

 iv. Convention Center Park; and

 v. Kobe Terrace Park and the publicly owned portions of the International District Community Garden.

 c. The decisionmaker shall assess the extent of adverse impacts and the need for mitigation. The analysis of sunlight blockage and shadow impacts shall include an assessment of the extent of shadows, including times of the year, hours of the day, anticipated seasonal use of open spaces, availability of other open spaces in the area, and the number of people affected.

 d. When the decisionmaker finds that a proposed project would substantially block sunlight from open spaces listed in subsections Q2a and Q2b above at a time when the public most frequently uses that space, the decisionmaker may condition or deny the project to mitigate the adverse impacts of sunlight blockage, whether or not the project meets the criteria of the Overview Policy set forth in SMC Section 25.05.665 .

 e. Mitigating measures may include, but are not limited to:

 i. Limiting the height of the development;

 ii. Limiting the bulk of the development;

 iii. Redesigning the profile of the development;

 iv. Limiting or rearranging walls, fences, or plant material;

 v. Limiting or rearranging accessory structures, i.e., towers, railing, antennae; and

 vi. Relocating the project on the site.

 R. Traffic and Transportation.

 1. Policy Background.

 a. Excessive traffic can adversely affect the stability, safety and character of Seattle's communities.

 b. Substantial traffic volumes associated with major projects may adversely impact surrounding areas.

 c. Individual projects may create adverse impacts on transportation facilities which service such projects. Such impacts may result in a need for turn channelization, right-of-way dedication, street widening or other improvements including traffic signalization.

 d. Seattle's land use policies call for decreasing reliance on the single occupant automobile and increased use of alternative transportation modes.

 e. Regional traffic and transportation impacts arising as a result of downtown development have been addressed in substantial part by the Downtown Land Use and Transportation Plan. Actions underway to mitigate impacts include the implementation of the Downtown Land Use Code and the construction of the downtown transit tunnel, both of which promote and encourage

 transit use.

 f. The University District in an area of the City which is subject to particularly severe traffic congestion problems, as highlighted in the 1983 City-University Agreement, and therefore deserves special attention in the environmental review of project proposals.

 2. Policies.

 a. It is the City's policy to minimize or prevent adverse traffic impacts which would undermine the stability, safety and/or character of a neighborhood or surrounding areas.

 b. In determining the necessary traffic and transportation impact mitigation, the decisionmaker shall examine the expected peak traffic and circulation pattern of the proposed project weighed against such factors as the availability of public transit; existing vehicular and pedestrian traffic conditions; accident history; the trend in local area development; parking characteristics of the immediate area; the use of the street as determined by the Seattle ~~Engineering~~Transportation Department's Seattle Comprehensive Transportation Plan; and the availability of goods, services and recreation within reasonable walking distance.

 c. Mitigation of traffic and transportation impacts shall be permitted whether or not the project meets the criteria of the Overview Policy set forth in SMC Section 25.05.665 .

 d. Mitigation measures which may be applied to residential projects in downtown are limited to the following:

 i. Signage;

 ii. Provision of information on transit and ride- sharing programs; and

 iii. Bicycle parking.

 S. Water Quality.

 1. Policy Background.

 a. Seattle's water quality is adversely affected primarily by the dumping of pollutants and drainage-related sewage overflows into Puget Sound, Lake Union, the Lake Washington Ship Canal, the Duwamish Waterway and all lakes, riparian corridors, wetlands, and other systems draining into these bodies of water.

 b. Seattle's water quality is also adversely affected by storm drainage runoff; non-point-source discharges from streets, parking lots and other impervious surfaces; construction site runoff; and sewage and graywater discharge from recreational and commercial watercraft.

 c. Federal, state, local and regional water quality regulations and programs cannot always anticipate or eliminate adverse impacts to water quality.

 2. Policies.

 a. It is the City's policy to minimize or prevent adverse water quality impacts.

 b. For any project proposal which poses a potential threat to water quality in Seattle, the decisionmaker shall assess the probable effect of the impact and the need for mitigating measures. The assessment shall be completed in consultation with appropriate agencies with expertise.

 c. Subject to the Overview Policy set forth in SMC Section 25.05.665 , if the decision-maker makes a written finding that the applicable federal, state and regional regulations did not anticipate or are inadequate to address the particular impact(s) of a project, the decisionmaker may condition or deny the

 project to mitigate its adverse impacts.

 d. Mitigating measures may include, but are not limited to:

 i. Use of an alternative technology;

 ii. Reduction in the size or scope of the project or operation;

 iii. Landscaping; and

 Scenic routes (1) described by ~~The City of Seattle Engineering Department~~Seattle Transportation,Traffic Division Map and by Ordinance 97027, and (2) identified as protected view rights-of-way in the Mayor's April 1987 Open Space Policies Recommendation. (See Exhibit 1 immediately following for a map of the designated SEPA Scenic Routes described above.)

 Section 219. SMC 25.08.520 is hereby amended as follows:

 Noise in public parks and places.

 A. It is unlawful for any person to cause, or for any person in charge of a group of persons to allow sound from an officially sanctioned musical event to originate in a public park, public place, as defined in the Street Use Ordinance No. 90047, public market or civic center which exceeds a L eq of ninety-five (95) dB(A) for one (1) minute as measured fifty feet (50') (approximately fifteen (15) meters) from the source or sources, whether or not the sounds are live or recorded. Provided, that this section shall not apply to indoor events.

 B. Each violation of this section which occurs after notice to the person (designated on the permit as the agent to receive notices of violations in the case of events with permits) that he or she is in violation of this section shall constitute a separate offense. At the time of application the applicant shall designate an on-premises agent who will accept notices of violations of this chapter during the event. The absence of the designated on-premises agent from the event or the inability of the serving agency to locate the on-premises agent or the refusal of an on-premises agent or responsible official of a group to accept notice of a violation shall not affect the validity of the initial or successive violations.

 C. The Administrator, the Director of Seattle Center, the Superintendent of Parks, the Director of ~~the SeattleEngineering Department~~Transportation, the Chief of Police, or an authorized representative of any of them may terminate a performance as a public nuisance after following the notice requirements of subsection B if the decibel level exceeds one hundred five (105) dB(A) for a total of five (5) minutes in any thirty (30) minute period as measured fifty feet (50') (approximately fifteen (15) meters) from the source or sources.

 D. Before any permit or other authorizing document is issued for any event which will produce sounds which may violate this section, the application shall be circulated to the Administrator. The Department of Construction and Land Use is authorized to attach any conditions consistent with this chapter and reasonably calculated to prevent annoying sounds.

 E. 1. In any permit for use of a public park, public market, civic center, or other public place, the Superintendent of Parks and Recreation, the Director of ~~the SeattleEngineering Department~~ Transportation or the Director of the Seattle Center or the designee of any of them, respectively, shall stipulate that the Department of Construction and Land Use provide sound- control monitoring services whenever:

 a. Amplified sound will be used at the proposed event; and

 b. The Administrator or his designee finds that, unless monitored, the sound level originating at the proposed event may exceed the sound level in SMC Section 25.08.520 A. The Administrator shall be guided principally by the expected power and type of amplification and, for those with a record of prior usage, by past events held on City property within the last two (2) years.

 2. The Administrator, in his or her discretion, may perform the service directly, delegate performance to the authority issuing the permit, or retain an acoustician.

 F. This section does not limit or diminish the management authority of the Superintendent of Parks and Recreation, the Director of ~~the SeattleEngineering Department~~Transportation or the Director of the Seattle Center to require a performance bond or cash deposit for the use and occupancy of a public park, a public place or public market, or the Seattle Center, respectively, as security for payment of costs and expenses related thereto, damages or cleanup costs that may arise from a proposed event, and/or taxes and other amounts that may become payable; nor does this section limit or diminish their management authority to grant or deny such permits for causes independent of the Noise Ordinance codified in this chapter.

 G. A copy or digest of this section on noise in public parks and public places shall be delivered to every person applying for a permit or other authorizing document which involves the production of sounds which may violate this section and the permittee shall sign a receipt signifying that he or she has received the same.

 III. MISCELLANEOUS PROVISIONS

 Section 220. It is the express intent of the City Council that, in the event another ordinance has heretofore been enacted that amended any section or subsection of the Seattle Municipal Code amended or recodified herein, that earlier amendment should be effectuated with equal dignity to this ordinance if at all possible in the codification of the Seattle Municipal Code and by the courts, notwithstanding the use in this ordinance of an obsolete version of that part of the Seattle Municipal Code on which to show intended amendments.

 Section 221. In the event any section or subsection of the Seattle Municipal Code purported to be amended or recodified herein has heretofore been repealed, that earlier repeal shall be given full effect, and nothing in this ordinance shall be construed to re-enact or preserve that section or subsection.

 Section 222. It is the express intent of the City Council that, in the event a subsequent ordinance refers to a position or office that was abolished by this ordinance, that reference shall be deemed to be to the new office or position created by this ordinance, and shall not be construed to resurrect the old position or office unless it expressly so provides by reference to this ordinance.

 Section 223. It is the express intent of the City Council that, in the event a subsequent ordinance refers to or amends a section or subsection of the Seattle Municipal Code amended or recodified herein, but the later ordinance fails to account for the change made by this ordinance, the two sets of amendments should be given effect together if at all possible.

 Section 224. The Executive Services Director shall have the power to make all administrative decisions necessary to carry out the intent of this ordinance.

 Section 225. The City Clerk shall publish in the City's legal newspaper the title and the first four (4) sections of this ordinance, a numerical tabulation by Seattle Municipal Code number of the sections or subsections that are amended by sections 5 through 219 of this ordinance, and a listing of any Seattle Municipal Code sections or subsections repealed as listed under the caption "Repealer" as the summary of this ordinance, and state as part of that publication that the entire text may be examined electronically at http://clerk.ci.seattle.wa.us/~public/ on the Internet, or in paper form at the offices of the City Clerk, First Floor, Seattle Municipal Building, 600 Fourth Avenue, Seattle, WA 98104, or will be mailed upon request.

 Section 226. The several provisions of this ordinance are declared to be separate and severable and the invalidity of any clause, sentence paragraph, subdivision, section, or portion of this ordinance, or the invalidity of the application thereof to any person or circumstance, shall not affect the validity of the remainder of this ordinance of the validity of its application to other persons or circumstances.

 Section 227. It is the express intent of the City Council that this ordinance makes only those changes to the Seattle Municipal Code shown by striking out, inside double parentheses, text to be deleted, and underlining text to be added. To this end, errors in showing the pre- existing Seattle Municipal Code text are to be disregarded, and no change in the Seattle Municipal Code is intended thereby.

 Section 228. Any act consistent with the authority and prior to the effective date of this ordinance are hereby ratified and confirmed.

 Section 229. This ordinance shall take effect and be in force thirty (30) days from and after its approval by the Mayor, but if not approved and returned by the Mayor within ten (10) days after presentation, it shall take effect as provided by Municipal Code Section 1.04.020.
