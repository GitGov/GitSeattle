 AN ORDINANCE relating to Seattle Public Utilities; declaring certain City properties located in the Tolt River Basin, King County, Washington as surplus to the City's needs; and authorizing the execution of a property exchange agreement and supplemental road use agreement with Weyerhaeuser Company, conveyance and acceptance of deeds, execution of closing documents, and acceptance and deposit of funds in connection with the property exchange.

 WHEREAS, the City of Seattle planned, constructed and, in 1963, placed in service a water supply source on the South Fork of the Tolt River; and

 WHEREAS, during development of this project, the City acquired lands necessary for the constructed facilities, as well as lands beneath and surrounding the reservoir formed by the project; and

 WHEREAS, in general, the City did not acquire lands elsewhere in the Watershed because of the high value of the existing timber, but instead entered into operations and road use agreements with Weyerhaeuser Company, the primary owner of land nearest the reservoir; and

 WHEREAS, the City's long-standing preference, and its actual practice in the Cedar River Watershed, has been to acquire ownership of lands within its watersheds as the primary means of protecting water quality, minimizing water treatment costs, and integrating land and resource management activities; and

 WHEREAS, in 1996, the City (pursuant to Ordinance 118222) and Weyerhaeuser Company entered into an exchange agreement which enabled the City to acquire the site for its planned Tolt Treatment Plant and which established the scope and principles for a more comprehensive land exchange; and

 WHEREAS, Weyerhaeuser Company has completed its planned harvest activities within the South Fork Tolt River Watershed and is willing to convey to the City its pre-commercial second-growth timberlands there (approximately 4785 acres), together with a site that would be required in the future if the City elects to develop a water supply source on the North Fork Tolt River (approximately 334 acres); and

 WHEREAS, Weyerhaeuser Company wishes to acquire certain non- operating properties owned by the City elsewhere in the Tolt River Basin outside of the South Fork Tolt Watershed (consisting of approximately 1530 acres); and

 WHEREAS, the parties have negotiated in good faith the proposed specific terms of the comprehensive exchange contemplated in 1996; NOW, THEREFORE,

 BE IT ORDAINED BY THE CITY OF SEATTLE AS FOLLOWS:

 Section 1. The Director of Seattle Public Utilities is hereby authorized to execute the Second Exchange Agreement (the "Agreement"), substantially in the form of Addendum 1 attached hereto and incorporated herein by reference, with Weyerhaeuser Company, to provide for an exchange of property in the Tolt River Basin, as described in Attachments I and II to the Agreement, and other valuable consideration, as described in the Agreement.

 Section 2. Pursuant to the provisions of RCW 35.94.040 and after public hearing, the real property described in the Quit Claim Deed from the City (Attachment I to the Agreement) and totaling approximately 1530 acres, is hereby found and declared to be no longer required for providing public utility service and to be surplus to the City's needs.

 Section 3. The Director of Seattle Public Utilities is hereby authorized to convey and accept quit claim deeds substantially in the form of Attachments I and II to the Agreement, to execute such other agreements, tax affidavits, real estate instruments, and documents as may be necessary to effectuate the exchange, and to receive and deposit in the Water Fund such cash as may be due and owing to the City as provided under terms of the Agreement.

 Section 4. The Director of Seattle Public Utilities is hereby authorized to execute the 1997 Supplemental Agreement to Road Use Agreement - Tolt River Watershed with Weyerhaeuser Company substantially in the form of Attachment IV to the Agreement.
