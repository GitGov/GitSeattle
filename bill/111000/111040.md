Each out-of-class assignment is limited to six (6) months unless an extension is authorized by the appointing authority.Appropriate reasons for considering the assignment of out-of- class duties include:  1. Absence of a position incumbent;

 2. Peak workload periods;

 3. Position vacancy; or

 4. Completion of a special project.

 B. Eligible employees assigned by proper authority to perform substantially the full duties of a higher paid classification for a period of two (2) weeks or more as determined in accordance with policy and procedure promulgated by the Budget Director shall be paid at the rate established for such higher paid position.An employee whose primary job title is eligible for overtime pay shall perform the ongoing duties of a higher-paid classification for a minimum of four (4) consecutive hours to be eligible for the higher pay rate. An employee whose primary job title is not eligible for overtime shall perform such duties for a minimum of two (2) consecutive weeks to be eligible for the higher pay rate.  1. Hours worked in an out-of-class assignment will be credited toward salary step placement in the event the employee who was so assigned is promoted, or his or her position reclassified, to the same class as the out-of-class assignment, within twelve (12) months of the end of such out-of-class assignment.

 2. When an employee is assigned to perform the same out-of- class duties on a full-time, continuous basis for twelve (12) months or longer, he or she will receive a step increment in the higher salary range; provided, that he or she has not already received an increment because of increases to the primary pay rate; provided further, that such increment does not exceed the top step of the higher salary range.

 C. In the case of the highest-ranking unsubordinated officer or employee of a department or office serving as acting head during a vacancy in the position of head of the department or office, in consideration of the additional work to be performed by the acting department or office head, the compensation shall be such person's regular salary plus, as a premium the difference between such salary and the lowest salary step for the department or office head position, commencing with the person's service as acting head.  In the case of a person designated by the Mayor to serve, in lieu of the highest-ranking officer or employee of such department or office, as acting head of such department or office, the compensation shall be an amount equal to the lowest salary fixed for the position of department or office head, commencing with such person's service as acting head. In the case of an employee appointed as acting head of a newly created office or department, the compensation shall be equal to the lowest salary fixed for that position, commencing the date such office or department is established. Compensation for service as acting head of a department or office shall be paid for up to six (6) months after the occurrence of such vacancy, and, in the event the Mayor does not submit to the City Council within such six (6) month period a nomination to fill such vacancy on a permanent basis, for such additional time as the City Council authorizes, by ordinance. Such compensation shall continue throughout the City Council's confirmation process, and for up to ninety (90) days after any City Council rejection of a nomination to fill the same, and shall terminate when such vacancy is filled on a permanent basis.

When an employee or officer serves as acting head of a department or office, payment for the performance of such higher duties shall be as follows:  1. If the employee or officer is the highest-ranking unsubordinated employee, he or she shall receive his or her regular salary, plus, for all hours worked as acting head, the difference between his or her regular salary and the lowest salary step of the higher position.

 2. If the Mayor designates someone other than the highest- ranking unsubordinated employee to be acting department or office head, the rate of compensation will be calculated as in promotion.

An acting head assignment may continue for up to ninety (90) days of any City Council rejection of a nomination to fill a department or office head vacancy and will terminate when such vacancy is filled on a permanent basis.
