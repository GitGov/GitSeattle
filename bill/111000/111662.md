 AN ORDINANCE amending a railroad franchise granted to the former Northern Pacific Railway Company in 1904 (before annexation to Seattle) by King County in Proceedings of the County Commissioners found in Volume 14, Page 437, to construct, lay down, maintain nd operate a single or double line track on, over, through and across the streets therein described, including Iowa Street (now Iowa Avenue Southwest); to provide for the corrected location of said franchise track in Iowa Avenue Southwest which was required to be relocated by reason of the City of Seattle's improvement and widening of said Iowa Avenue Southwest,

 is hereby repealed and all rights-of-way granted thereunder and all rights, privileges and benefits conferred thereby are, hereby declared forfeited and to be null and void and of no force or effect.

 Section 6. The City of Seattle shall retain the same control of the streets and avenues in and across which said railway tracks shall be laid down as over other streets and avenues in said city, and shall have the right at all times by general ordinance, to regulate the speed of the locomotives, cars and trains within the limits of the franchise right-of-way herein granted, and the maximum period of time for which such locomotives, cars and trains shall be allowed to blockade travel along and across the streets, avenues, and intersecting streets embraced in this grant, and shall have such further control and police power over such franchise rights-of-way and tracks, and the use thereof, as the City Charter and the Federal and State Constitutions and laws may now or hereafter permit. Grantee shall erect and maintain all such safety devices, warning signs and signals, lights and appliances as may be necessary to protect and facilitate public travel across each and every track herein authorized.

 Section 7. The City hereby reserves to itself and its Grantee the right to construct all public improvements and to install and carry all public utility facilities across, underneath or above the tracks hereby authorized, and the City reserves to itself full and complete right of access to any space occupied by such tracks and to all of said franchise right-of-way within the limits of West Marginal Way Southwest, Southwest Hinds Street and Chelan Avenue Southwest, together with the right to open and excavate the ground beneath said tracks, or within said franchise right-of-way, for all purposes of construction, maintenance, repair, operation and inspection of any public utilities and public improvements which rights shall, however, be exercised in such manner as not to interfere with the safe operation of locomotives, cars and trains on said tracks. In all cases involving a possibility of such interference, or removal of lateral support or excavation beneath the tracks of Grantee, sixty (60) days' written notice shall be given Grantee, and said Grantee shall, at its own cost and expense, remove, relocate, support, reinforce said tracks as necessary, provide flagging, and shall also furnish an authorized agent or representative at Grantee's own cost and expense, who shall supervise such removal, relocation, support, reinforcement or excavation or other work; provided that, in case of emergency repairs, the length of such notice may be less than sixty (60) days, but not less than twelve (12) hours. Grantee shall have the option of requiring that any such construction, repair, renewal, maintenance or inspection of municipally owned utility be done by tunnelling or jacking beneath said tracks, if such utility determines that tunnelling or jacking is practicable, and upon Grantee's providing assurances, satisfactory to such municipally owned utility, that Grantee will pay the extra cost of tunnelling or jacking, over the cost of open cutting. If it is necessary that such tracks should be removed, relocated, supported, or reinforced during the progress of the construction, repair, renewal, maintenance, or inspection of any municipally operated utility, or for any public improvement, Grantee shall remove or relocate said tracks and shall construct and place such support and provide a flagman as necessary, and shall attend to the replacement and readjustment of its tracks, all at its own cost and expense.

 Section 8. Grantee shall be solely responsible for the maintenance and safety of the right-of-way granted herein, including all tracks and all grade crossings, and shall cooperate and coordinate with the City of Seattle Director of Seattle Transportation to assure adequate rehabilitation, repair and maintenance of all tracks and grade crossings herein authorized, in compliance with the Letter of Understanding between Burlington Northern Railroad (now Burlington Northern and Santa Fe Railway Company), Union Pacific Railroad and the City of Seattle (City of Seattle Comptroller File No. 296593) dated July 18, 1988, and with all existing and future City of Seattle, State and/or Federal railroad grade crossing standards and regulations, and under the direction of and to the satisfaction of the Director of Seattle Transportation, all at Grantee's sole cost and expense. Grantor shall issue permits to Grantee which shall set forth the terms and conditions for railroad track work within the limits of the City of Seattle, one permit that will be effective for a two-year period for the performance of minor maintenance work and temporary repairs of railroad grade crossings; and individual permits for the performance of major railroad track work that will impact vehicular and/or pedestrian traffic, to the extent the issuance or terms and conditions of the permits are not inconsistent with State and Federal Law.

 Section 9. Grantee shall construct and maintain the tracks herein authorized so that the top of the rail thereof shall at all times conform to the street grade (except where change is made in separation of grades), and the City hereby reserves the right to change the grade of any streets, avenues or public places at any time, and when the said City shall change such grade the Grantee, by acceptance of this ordinance, hereby covenants and agrees with the City, to waive any and all damages that it may sustain on account of having to readjust its tracks by reason of such change of grade. Such waiver is made upon condition that any change of grade hereafter made by the City to the streets and avenues upon which the franchise is hereby granted, shall not be unreasonable, or such as to interfere with the proper and practical operation of said track when the same shall have been adjusted to said new grade.

 Section 10. Grantee shall, upon permit issued by the Director of Seattle Transportation or such other body as may in the future be by law authorized to act, allow each owner or occupant of a warehouse or industry contiguous or adjacent to said track herein authorized, or to any street, avenue or other public place along or across which said tracks shall be constructed, a spur track or tracks connecting said track with such warehouse or industry; provided, however, that Grantee may require that such spur track or tracks and all street grading, surfacing or paving appertaining to the right-of-way of such spur track or tracks, be constructed and maintained at the expense of such owner or occupant of such warehouse or industry; and provided further that any such spur track shall start from such point on said track as Grantee shall determine upon as the most proper therefor; and shall be subject to such rules and regulations as to the opening and closing of switches controlling access to and as to the use of said track as Grantee may from time-to-time establish. All of the obligations and duties of Grantee expressed in this franchise shall apply with full force and effect to each and every spur track laid down, constructed, maintained or operated by Grantee connecting with the tracks or right- of-way granted in Section 1 of this franchise.

 Section 11. Nothing contained in this ordinance shall be construed as granting an exclusive franchise or privilege for the use of West Marginal Way Southwest, Southwest Hinds Street or Chelan Avenue Southwest, or any portion thereof, and the rights granted by this ordinance shall be subject to the right of the City Council to at any time hereafter, to repeal, amend or modify this ordinance and grant, with due regard to the rights of Grantee and of the interests of the public, and to cancel, forfeit and abrogate any right or privilege granted by this ordinance if the franchise hereby granted is not operated in full accordance with the provisions hereof, or at all, and at any time during the grant to acquire by purchase or condemnation, for use of the City itself, all the property of the Grantee within the limits of said streets at a fair and just value, which shall not include any valuation of the franchise itself, which franchise shall thereupon terminate.

 Section 12. Except as herein provided, this franchise and the rights herein granted, or any interest in them, shall not be sold, assigned or mortgaged without the consent of the City by ordinance. Nor shall the same in such event accrue to the benefit of the purchaser, assignee or mortgagee unless within sixty (60) days after such consent it or they shall file with the Finance Department and City Clerk of the City of Seattle an acceptance of all the rights, privileges and authorities hereby granted, subject to all the conditions, restrictions, specifications and requirements herein expressed. Provided, that the rights acquired hereunder shall be deemed appurtenant to and running with the railroad system of the Grantee, and may be sold, assigned, leased or mortgaged as an entirety in connection with and as a part of said railroad system without such consent or acceptance.

 Section 13. Grantee, by its acceptance of this grant, does agree and covenant for itself, to protect, indemnify and save harmless The City of Seattle from all claims, actions, suits, liability, loss, costs, expenses or damages of every kind and description which may accrue to, or be suffered by, any person or persons, or property, including without limitation damage or injury to Grantee, its officers, agents, employees, contractors, successors and assigns, arising in any way from, or alleged to arise from, or by reason of any of the following:

 (1) The operation, loading, unloading or use of any and all locomotives, cars, trains, railroad equipment or other machinery and railway vehicles in or over said right-of-way;

 (2) Any defective, unsafe or misleading condition created, caused or contributed to by Grantee in or on said right-of-way and/or railroad tracks, or condition which endangers the safety, use of or travel upon or across said right-of-way;

 (3) Any deficiency in the construction, maintenance or operation of any barricades, fences, signs, signals, warning devices and other protective devices that Grantee is required to establish or maintain, by law, by ordinance or mutual agreement with the City;

 (4) The actions, negligence, or omissions of Grantee, its forces, agents, contractors, or any of them, in or using said right-of-way;

 (5) Damage to any municipally owned utility within the franchise right-of-way, and any resulting damages for which said municipally owned utility may be liable to any person, persons or property because of damage to said municipally owned utility, including without limitation: flooding from broken watermains, storm drains or sewers, electrical damage, interruption of municipally owned utility service, resulting from the construction, maintenance or operation of the railroad and rail equipment within the franchise right-of-way. The above liability shall not be diminished by the fact, if it be a fact, that any such death, injury, damage, loss, cost or expense may have been contributed to, or alleged to have been contributed to, by the negligence of the City, its agents or employees; provided, however, that nothing herein contained shall be construed as requiring Grantee to indemnify the City against liability for damages arising out of bodily injury to persons or damage to property caused by or resulting from the negligence of the City.

 Upon commencement of any such suit or action against the City, Grantee shall upon notice, defend the same at its sole cost and expense, and in case judgement shall be rendered against the City in such action or suit, shall fully satisfy such judgement within ninety (90) days after such action or suit shall have been finally determined, if determined adversely to the City.

 Section 14. Grantee, by its acceptance of this ordinance, does covenant and agree with the City of Seattle, that whenever the City of Seattle separates the grades of existing or future streets by the construction, reconstruction, renewal, maintenance, and/or widening of any overhead structure across the right-of-way herein granted, Grantee will bear its proportionate share of all costs incident to the span crossing said right-of-way and the piers or abutments supporting such span. Such proportionate share shall be determined on the ratio the length of the portion of the span crossing said right-of-way bears to the total length of said span, and Grantee shall pay its aforesaid share upon proper billing therefore by the Director of Seattle Transportation.
