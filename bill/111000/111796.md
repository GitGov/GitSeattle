 A. In other than Group A, E and I occupancies, listed potable hot water heaters (fired, electric, thermal, solar, and indirect) and pool heaters, provided none of the following limitations are exceeded:

 A heat input of 200,000 Btu/h, or

 A water temperature of 210 F., or

 A nominal water-containing capacity of 120 gallons, or

 A pressure of 160 pounds per square inch.

 B. Portable unfired pressure vessels subject to regular inspection by State of Washington inspectors and I.C.C./D.O.T. containers.

 C. Containers for liquefied petroleum gases which are regulated by the Seattle Fire Code.

 D. Unfired pressure vessels in Groups B, F, H, M, R, S and ((M)) U Occupancies having a volume of 5 cubic feet or less and operated at pressures not exceeding 250 psi.

 E. Unfired pressure vessels of any size, other than those containing steam, that are proteced by approved pressure relief devices set to operate at a pressure not exceeding 15 psi.

 F. Any boiler or pressure vessel subject to regular inspection by federal inspectors or licensed by federal authorities.

 G. Combination water heaters listed for both potable water supply and space heating listed under ANSI Z21.10.3, "Gas Water Heaters", 1988 Addenda or later, that are used for both potable water and space heating ((and are installed in:

 1. Group R occupancies of less than six dwelling units; or

 2. Group R occupancies where each water heater serves less than six dwelling units; or

 3. Group M occupancies)).

 H. Electric Boilers:

 1. Having a vessel volume not exceeding one and one-half cubic feet; and

 2. Having a maximum allowable working pressure of eighty (80) psi; and

 3. If constructed after June 10, 1994, constructed to the American Society of Mechanical Engineers Boiler and Pressure Vessel Code, or listed or otherwise certified by a nationally recognized testing agency or recognized foreign testing laboratory.

 I. Water storage tanks with no air cushion and no energy or heat source.

 Section Section 240 of Seattle Municipal Code Chapter 22.450, the Seattle Boiler and Pressure Vessel Code, which section was adopted by Ordinance 117723, is amended as follows:

 Section 240-Certificate of Inspection

 It shall be unlawful to operate any boiler or pressure vessel without first obtaining a valid certificate of inspection from the Director. Certificates of Inspection shall be displayed in a conspicuous place adjacent to boiler or vessel. The Certificate of Inspection shall not be issued until the equipment has been inspected and approved by the Director. A grace period of no longer than sixty (60) days beyond the expiration date of any Certificate of Inspection may be granted.

 Exception: The operation of steam heating boilers, low-pressure hot- water heating boilers, hot-water-supply boilers and pressure vessels in Group R Occupancies of less than six units and in Group ((M)) U Occupancies.

 Section Section 390.B of Seattle Municipal Code Chapter 22.450, the Seattle Boiler and Pressure Vessel Code, which section was adopted by Ordinance 117723, is amended as follows:

 B. Gas Pressure Regulators. An approved gas-pressure regulator shall be installed on gas-fired boilers where the gas supply pressure is higher than that at which the main burner is designed to operate. A separate approved gas-pressure regulator shall be installed to regulate the gas pressure to the pilot or pilots. A separate regulator shall not be required for the pilot or pilots on manufacturer-assembled boiler-burner units which have been approved by the Director and on gas-fired boilers in Group R Occupancies of less than six units and in Group ((M)) U Occupancies.
