 ORDINANCE ___________

 AN ORDINANCE authorizing design of a new Municipal Court building and analysis of other associated development on the same site for municipal and other purposes; creating a new fund for tracking expenditures on the project; making an appropriation for funding such design and analysis; and authorizing an interfund loan to support that appropriation; all upon a three-fourths vote of the City Council.

 WHEREAS Ordinance 117739 authorized the purchase of Key Tower for general municipal office purposes, and appropriated funds for improving public access to the building, and

 WHEREAS studies of the structure and systems in the Public Safety Building have indicated that much of the building has reached the end of its usable life, and that to restore the structure and systems would not be a cost effective solution, and

 WHEREAS Resolution 29612 adopted in concept the Long Range Facilities Plan of June 5, 1997 prepared by the Executive Services Department (ESD); and directed ESD to move forward with the design of a new Municipal Court building and to identify financing options for such a building, and

 WHEREAS Resolution 29612 endorsed the preliminary selection of the Cordes property as the site for the new Municipal Court Building, subject to any required environmental review and completion of a design and final cost projections; and directed ESD to explore various size and capacity options for the building, and pedestrian access connecting the new Municipal Court Building with Key Tower, and

 WHEREAS Resolution 29612 directed the Executive Services Department to prepare legislation authorizing funds for design of the components of the Cordes site proposal, and

 WHEREAS a separate fund is an appropriate way to track the monies used for the design and construction of a new Municipal Court Building; and

 WHEREAS in order to meet the schedule adopted in Resolution 29612 for completion of a new Municipal Court building, it is necessary to provide interim financing for the design components, which will be reimbursed in the future by longer-term financing; and

 WHEREAS selling municipal bonds is not the most cost effective or timely way to finance the design and analysis of a new Municipal Court Building, and

 WHEREAS The Cumulative Reserve Subfund is intended to support capital improvement projects and has a sufficient fund balance available to loan the project funding to begin the design process, and

 WHEREAS The Cumulative Reserve Subfund will earn market rate interest on the project loan and will be reimbursed at such time as longer term financing is secured,

 NOW THEREFORE:

 BE IT ORDAINED BY THE CITY OF SEATTLE AS FOLLOWS:

 Section 1. As recommended by the Mayor, the Executive Services Director is authorized to pay for the costs associated with design of a new Municipal Court Building on the Cordes site, and feasibility studies of other associated potential uses (the "Project"). The proposed schedule for this work effort is shown in Attachment A.

 Section 2. There is hereby established in the City Treasury the "Municipal Courthouse Fund" into which shall be deposited the monies to be used for the Project, and from which all Project expenditures shall be made. Interest earnings on balances in this fund will be retained by the fund. The Finance Director may create subfunds and accounts as needed to facilitate accounting for activities in connection with a new Municipal Court Building.

 Section 3. To pay for the costs of design and analysis authorized in Section 1, the following amounts are appropriated from the Municipal Courthouse Fund:

 PROJECT ELEMENT DESCRIPTION AMOUNT

 Municipal Court Building Programming $ 100,000 Design $ 2,700,000 Environmental Review $ 200,000

 Access to Key Tower Design $ 400,000

 Building Envelope Studies Size and Capacity Options $ 55,000

 ESD Project Management 1 FTE through design $ 375,000 (6/30/00)

 Percent for Art $ 270,000

 TOTAL $ 4,100,000

 Unexpended, and unencumbered appropriation amounts will carry forward from year to year until fully expended, or abandoned by ordinance.

 Section 4. To support the appropriation made in Section 3, an interfund loan from the Cumulative Reserve Subfund #116 to the Municipal Courthouse Fund is authorized in the maximum amount of Four Million One Hundred Thousand Dollars ($4,100,000) or so much thereof as may be necessary to keep the Municipal Courthouse Fund from being in a negative cash position. The loan shall last no longer than December 31, 2001, unless extended by subsequent ordinance. The Municipal Courthouse Fund shall pay interest to the Cumulative Reserve Subfund on the borrowed funds at a rate that reflects the Cumulative Reserve Subfund's earnings on its other investments. The principal amount of the loan from the Cumulative Reserve Subfund #116 together with interest will be repaid from the Municipal Courthouse Fund with proceeds from longer term project funding expected to be obtained by the sale of General Obligation Bonds prior to construction of a new Municipal Court Building. The Finance Director is hereby authorized to execute all necessary interfund loan documents and make fund transfers as necessary.

 Section 5. All acts consistent with the authority and prior to the effective date of this ordinance are hereby ratified and confirmed.

 Section 6. The foregoing appropriations are made to meet actual necessary expenditures of the City for which insufficient appropriations have been made due to causes which could not reasonably have been foreseen at the time of the adoption of the 1997 Budget; Now, Therefore, in accordance with RCW 35.32A.060, by reason of the facts above stated this ordinance shall take effect and be in force thirty (30) days from and after its passage and approval, if approved by the Mayor, but if not approved and returned by the Mayor within ten (10) days after presentation, it shall take effect as provided by Municipal Code Section 1.04.020.
