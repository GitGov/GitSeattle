 ARTICLE 193

 MINIMUM STANDARD FOR HIGH-RISE BUILDINGS

 SECTION 19301 -- GENERAL

 19301.1 Purpose. The main purpose of this article is to improve the fire and life safety of existing high-rise buildings that do not conform to current City codes so that the health, safety and welfare of the general public is provided for and promoted. It is recognized that the application of present day fire protection techniques to some existing high-rise buildings is difficult. For this reason, this article may permit the use of alternative methods and innovative approaches and techniques to achieve its purpose, when approved by the Chief and the Building Official.

 19301.2 Scope. This article shall apply to all high-rise buildings in existence at the time of its adoption, as well as to all high-rise buildings coming into existence after the adoption thereof.

 19301.2.1 Hazards and design features. Whenever the Chief shall find a condition in a high-rise building not specifically addressed in this Article, which in his opinion makes fire escape or fire fighting unusually difficult, he shall declare it to be a hazard, notify the owner of such condition and order its correction in a manner consistent with these minimum safeguards.

 19301.2.2 Exempt Buildings. The Chief and the Director of the Department of Construction and Land Use may exempt high-rise buildings that meet the requirements of Section 403 of the Building Code from complying with provisions of this Article.

 19301.2.3 Conflicts. Where there is a conflict between an ordinance or code and the provisions of this article, this article shall govern unless the ordinance or code establishes more stringent fire and life safety requirements.

 19301.3 Definitions. For the purpose of this Article, certain words shall be construed as specified in this section.

 CENTRAL STATION: A fire alarm reporting service listed by the Underwriters Laboratories or authorized by the Chief to report alarms to the Seattle Fire Department Alarm Center.

 1. Such staff are properly trained to monitor the annunciator panel and report alarm signals to the Fire Department Alarm Center via the 9-1-1 system.

 2. One or more building staff is on duty 24 hours a day and, remains in the direct vicinity of the annunciator panel, e.g., a hotel desk clerk where the panel is behind the registration desk.

 3. Staff persons in low income high-rise buildings whose primary duty requires them to be at the front desk are available.

 DEAD-END CORRIDOR: A corridor which permits only one direction of travel from a unit or normally occupied room door to an exit, or which intersects an exit corridor on one end and does not provide an exit path on the other end. A corridor which has fire escapes directly accessible from it is not a dead-end corridor.

 FLOOR USED FOR HUMAN OCCUPANCY: A floor designed and intended for occupancy by one or more persons for any part of a day, including a roof garden and an active storage area. An area that is permanently unoccupied or is occupied for the service of building equipment only is not included in this definition.

 HIGH-RISE BUILDING: Buildings having floors used for human occupancy located more than 75 feet above the lowest level of Fire Department vehicle access.

 LOW INCOME RESIDENTIAL BUILDINGS: Are defined for this Article as those buildings that meet the following requirements:

 1.
