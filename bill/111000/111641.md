 AN ORDINANCE relating to assisting legal immigrants who are non- citizens to become United States citizens; decreasing an appropriation in the 1997 budget of Finance General and reappropriating that expenditure authority for naturalization efforts.

 WHEREAS, in adopting the 1997 budget, the City Council directed the Executive to develop a detailed strategic response to federal law changes in welfare policy and immigration law; and

 WHEREAS, one component of the strategy requested by the City Council was to be an implementation plan for 1997 to address the need for increased efforts to assist legal immigrants who are non-citizens to become United States citizens; and

 WHEREAS, it is a public purpose of the City of Seattle to assist legal immigrants to become United States citizens so as to reduce the new demands expected to be placed on City social services by non-citizens as a result of changes in federal laws; and

 WHEREAS, in the 1997 adopted budget Two Hundred Fifty Thousand Dollars ($250,000) was appropriated to the Department of Finance General with the intent that this amount be spent, after approval of an implementation plan, on those increased naturalization efforts; and

 A. DHHS will administer the funds to provide naturalization assistance services in training and technical assistance and the provision of core services which can include direct and supportive services.

 B. Any funds expended through community-based agencies and groups, public or private, must be matched at a rate of Twenty-five percent (25%) with non-City funds or with an in-kind match of direct services, or with a combination of the two; except that any funds expended through the Seattle Housing Authority must be matched by dollars at a rate of One Hundred percent (100%) from non-City funds.

 Section 4. The Director of DHHS is authorized, for and on behalf of the City of Seattle, to enter into contracts, with the specified percentage matches, to obtain the services for which funds are appropriated in Section 3.

 Section 5. Execution of the agreements authorized in Section 4, and any other acts pursuant to the authority and prior to the effective date of this ordinance, are hereby ratified and confirmed.
