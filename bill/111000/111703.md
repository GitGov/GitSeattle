 Section 4. The Personnel Director is authorized to implement a pilot compensation program in the Executive Department, Office of Management and Planning (OMP). The pilot compensation program will provide for continuity and equity in compensation, organizational flexibility, and the ability to recognize and reward performance. The plan document is attached as Exhibit A. The pilot compensation program will be implemented the first pay period after the effective date of this ordinance, or as soon as possible thereafter, and will be in effect for two (2) years; provided, that upon the completion of one (1) year, the Personnel and OMP Directors will evaluate its effectiveness at achieving its objectives and may recommend that the City Council end the pilot. Within six (6) months preceding its two (2) year anniversary, the Personnel and OMP Directors will again evaluate the pilot results and recommend to the City Council that it be continued, expanded, or allowed to terminate after two (2) years. Pilot evaluation criteria are attached as Exhibit B.

 Section 5. Upon implementation, the OMP Director will designate a salary level for each pilot position that most closely corresponds to the rate of pay received by the incumbent thereof immediately prior to implementation. Those position incumbents who currently receive a rate of pay above or below the pay rate associated with the band level into which they are placed will continue to receive that rate of pay, including applicable cost-of-living adjustments, at the discretion of the OMP Director; provided, that the OMP Director may review the job duties of a pilot position at any time after pilot implementation and, based upon his or her determination about the level and complexity of job duties and/or employee performance, revise the employee's salary either upward or downward. Salary revisions will correspond to criteria and job characteristics as described in Exhibit C, attached. The salary determination of the OMP Director is not subject to appeal.

 Section 6. The OMP Director may, at his or her discretion, award performance recognition payments to Policy and Management Analysts after reviewing annual performance evaluations. The amount of the award made to an employee will be at the discretion of the OMP director, and may be up to 6% of the employee's base salary. Any payments made will not be cumulative nor added to the base salary. A performance recognition payment must be preceded by a formal performance evaluation, and may be awarded in conjunction with an assessment of the employee's eligibility to receive merit leave.

 Section 7. OMP will fund performance recognition payments from salary savings or other savings within the office's regularly appropriated budget. Sufficient appropriations within OMP grand objects of expenditure for Personal Services or Other Charges that are unexpended and unencumbered at the end of each budget year shall carry forward to the subsequent year for the purpose of funding employee performance pay at an adequate level.

 Section 8. Effect of transfer out of the pilot, or pilot termination, on employees.

 A. Policy and Management Analysts who transfer, promote, or reduce to other City positions outside the pilot will have salary step placement calculated in accordance with Seattle Municipal Code Section 4.20.080.

 B. If the pilot is terminated, the Personnel Director may retitle affected positions to other exempt titles in the City's salary schedule and compensation plan based on the work assigned at the time of the pilot's termination.

 1. If the incumbents are returned to the same title they held prior to pilot implementation, their combined service in such title and in the pilot shall count as continuous service in the title.

 a. If the original title has a lower maximum salary step than an affected employee was paid at the termination of the pilot, the employee will continue to be paid at the higher rate of pay until the maximum step of the lower salary range matches or exceeds the "incumbency" rate of pay.

 b. If the original title has a higher maximum salary step than an affected employee was paid at the termination of the pilot, the employee's combined service in such title and in the pilot shall count as continuous service in the title.

 Section 9. Any acts made consistent with the authority and prior to the effective date of this ordinance are hereby ratified and confirmed.

 Section 10. This ordinance shall take effect and be in force thirty (30) days from and after its approval by the Mayor, but if not approved and returned by the Mayor within ten (10) days after presentation, it shall take effect as provided by Municipal Code Section 1.04.020.
