 AN ORDINANCE relating to the Administrative Services Fund; changing the name of the Fund to the Executive Services Fund, expanding the purposes of the Fund, and amending chapter 5.76 of the Municipal Code to reflect the name change.

 WHEREAS, The City created the Executive Services Department (ESD) on January 1, 1997 to carry out many functions of the former Administrative Services, Finance, and Personnel Departments and other activities; and

 WHEREAS, throughout the first half of 1997 ESD has been bringing financial and rate analyses to the Council Finance and Budget Committee for committee review and direction; and

 WHEREAS, on April 16, 1997, ESD presented to the Finance and Budget Committee fund structure options and recommendations; and

 WHEREAS, the current ESD fund structure mirrors the fund structure of the three pre-ESD departments, with the Finance Division and the Personnel Division both operating directly from the General Fund, and the former Department of Administrative Services divisions (Technology Services, Facilities Services, Fleet Services, Contracting Services, and Finance and Administration) each operating from a separate subfund within an internal services fund; and

 WHEREAS, the fund structure option recommended by ESD is to place all divisions into separate subfunds in the department's internal services fund; and

The Table of Funds in chapter 5.76 of the Municipal Code shall be amended accordingly.
