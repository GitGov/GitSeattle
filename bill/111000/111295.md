Within fourteen (14) days of receiving the additional information, the staff shall notify the applicant in writing whether the application is now complete or what additional information is necessary. Any application shall be deemed to be complete if the staff does not notify the applicant in writing by the deadlines in this section that the application is incomplete. A determination that the application is complete is not a determination that the application is vested.

 4. The determination of completeness does not preclude the staff or the District Board from requiring additional information during the review process if more information is needed to evaluate the application according to the standards in this Chapter and in any rules adopted by the board, or if the proposed work changes. For example, additional information that may be required could include a shadow study or a traffic study when new construction is proposed.

The staff may reject the request if it appears that approval of a preliminary design would not be an efficient use of staff or District Board time and resources, or would not further the goals and objectives of this Chapter. To be complete, an application for a certificate of approval for a preliminary design must include the information listed above in subsection A.2, subparagraphs a through h, i(1) through i(3), m and n. A certificate of approval that is granted for a preliminary design shall be conditioned upon subsequent submittal of the final design and all of the information listed above in subsection A.2,  and upon obtaining a certificate of approval for final design, prior to issuance of permits for work affecting any building or property in the District.

C. If before a certificate of approval is obtained, an application is made to the Department of Construction and Land Use for a permit for which a certificate of approval is required, the Director of Construction and Land Use shall require the applicant to submit an application to the District Board for a certificate of approval. Submission of a complete application for a certificate of approval to the District Board shall be required before the permit application to the Department of Construction and Land Use may be deemed to be complete. The Department of Construction and Land Use shall continue to process such application, but shall not issue any permit until a certificate of approval has been issued pursuant to this Chapter, or the time has expired for filing with the Director of the Department of Construction and Land Use the notice of denial of a certificate of approval.

~~~~~~B. Decision on application. Within thirty (30) days after receipt of a complete application the District Board shall hold a public meeting thereon and by duly approved motion recommend to the Director of the Department of Neighborhoods that the same be granted, denied, or granted with conditions The Director of the Department of Neighborhoods shall issue a decision within fifteen (15) days of receiving the Board's recommendation.~~

If the Director of the Department of Neighborhoods does not issue a decision within the time provided by this Chapter, then the application shall be deemed approved. Provided, however, that the applicant may waive the deadlines in writing for the District Board to make a recommendation or the Director of the Department of Neighborhoods to make a decision, if the applicant also waives in writing any deadlines on the review or issuance of related permits that are under review by the Department of Construction and Land Use. Before issuing a recommendation of denial, the District Board may, upon agreement with the applicant that the deadlines shall be waived, defer such action and consult with the applicant for the purpose of considering means of modifying the application and considering alternatives in keeping with the aforesaid purpose, criteria and guidelines. If at the end of an agreed upon period of time no acceptable solution has been reached, the District Board shall make its recommendation and the applicant shall be so notified by letter.

 B. The Director of the Department of Neighborhoods shall send copies of the decision to the applicant, the property owner, the Director of Construction and Land Use and to the District Board.

 106.6 Permit Issuance

 106.6.1 General. The application, plans, specifications and other data filed by an applicant for a permit shall be reviewed by the building official. Such plans may be reviewed by other departments of the City to check compliance with the laws and ordinances under their jurisdiction. The building official shall mail notice to or otherwise notify the applicant within twenty-eight~~working~~ days of application if additional information is required  and what additional information is required before the application will be complete ~~to commence building permit application review~~.  Within fourteen days of receiving the additional information, the building official shall notify the applicant in writing whether the application is now complete or what additional information is necessary. An application shall be deemed to be complete if the building official does not notify the applicant in writing by the deadlines in this section that the application is incomplete.  The Director shall approve, condition or deny the application  within 120 ~~ninety working~~ days, as that time period is calculated pursuant to RCW 36.70B.090. If the building official finds that the work as described in an application for permit and the plans, specifications and other data filed therewith substantially conforms to the requirements of this building code and other pertinent laws and ordinances and the fees specified in the Permit Fee Ordinance have been paid, he/she shall issue a permit therefor to the applicant who becomes the permit holder or authorized agent.

 EXCEPTIONS: 1. The Building Official may issue a permit for the construction of part of a building or structure before complete plans for the whole building or structure have been submitted or approved, provided that the proposed project complies with the State Environmental Policy Act as adopted by the City (Chapter 25.05 Seattle Municipal Code) and as amended and the Land Use and Zoning Ordinances, as amended; and provided further that adequate information and plans have been filed and checked to assure compliance with all pertinent requirements of this and other pertinent codes. The holder of such a permit shall proceed at his/her own risk without the assurance that the permit for the entire building or structure will be granted.

 2. After approval of a Master Use Permit as required by the Land Use Code, a permit for excavation may be issued.

 The building official may condition a permit where he/she determines that risks associated with development, construction, ownership and occupation in areas of the city, including, but not limited to potential slide areas, can be reduced to an acceptable level. The building official may deny such permit where he/she determines that the risks cannot be reduced to an acceptable level.

 106.6.2 Compliance with Approved Plans and Permit. When the building official issues a permit, he/she shall endorse the permit in writing and endorse in writing or stamp the plans APPROVED. Such approved plans and permit shall not be changed, modified or altered without authorization from the building official, and all work shall be done in accordance with the approved plans and permit except as the building official may require during field inspection to correct errors or omissions.

 106.6.3 Amendments to the Permit. When substitutions or changes are made during construction, approval shall be secured prior to execution, however, the building inspector may approve minor modifications to the plans for work not reducing the structural strength or fire and life safety of the structure. The building inspector shall determine if it is necessary to revise the approved plans. Substitutions or changes made during construction subject to special inspection required by Section 1701 shall be approved by the building official. Substitutions, changes and clarifications shall be shown on two sets of plans which shall be submitted to and approved by the building official, accompanied by fees specified in the Permit Fee Ordinance prior to occupancy. These substitutions and changes shall conform to the requirements of this building code and other pertinent laws and ordinances.

 106.6.4 Cancellation of Permit Application An application shall be deemed abandoned and void if a permit is not issued after a period of sixty days from the date of written notice of approval for issuance or if complete corrections are not received after a period of sixty days from the date of written notification of required corrections for compliance with this code; provided that the building official may extend the period for issuance or submission of corrections if it is determined that there are good reasons for the delay, which are satisfactory to the building official, or if a different schedule is agreed upon in writing before the end of the sixty day period. A request for the extension must be submitted in writing before the end of the sixty day period. If the permit application is canceled, the site may be inspected to verify that no work has taken place. The application and any accompanying plans and specifications shall be destroyed. If the application is being reviewed concurrently with a Master Use Permit application, and it is for a project vested to prior Land use Code or Zoning Ordinance provisions, and the project does not conform with the codes in effect while it is being reviewed for Master Use Permit approval, cancellation of the building permit application under the provisions of this section shall cause the concurrent cancellation of the Master Use Permit application.

 Section 20. The code amendments made by Ordinance 118012 apply to applications filed on or after the effective date of that ordinance. Applications filed before the effective date of Ordinance 118012 are not subject to the amendments made by that ordinance even if such applications are not made sufficiently complete to satisfy vesting requirements until after the effective date of Ordinance 118012.

 Section 21. Section 20 of this ordinance states the Council's intent in the adoption of Ordinance 118012 and any acts done prior to the effective date of this ordinance that are consistent with Section 20 are hereby ratified and confirmed.

 Section 22. This ordinance shall take effect and be in force thirty (30) days from and after its approval by the Mayor, but if not approved and returned by the Mayor within ten (10) days after presentation, it shall take effect as provided by Municipal Code Section 1.04.020.
