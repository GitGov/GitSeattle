 AN ORDINANCE relating to use of sick leave accounts after retirement; amending Seattle Municipal Code Section 4.24.200.

 BE IT ORDAINED BY THE CITY OF SEATTLE AS FOLLOWS:

 Section 1. Seattle Municipal Code Section 4.24.200, Ordinance 90789 as amended, is further amended as follows:

 4.24.200 Establishment of account.

 Upon the retirement of any member of the City Employees' Retirement System or any Health Department employee who has retained membership in the State Retirement System under Ordinance 83017, or upon the award of a retirement allowance in accordance with Section 13 (c) of Ordinance 78444 to a member whose employment with the City has been terminated by layoff, or, at the election of a member of such system, upon retirement after transfer of such member to another governmental entity under any agreement for merger or consolidation of governmental services between the City and such other governmental entity, the Board of Administration of the City Employees' Retirement System shall establish for such member an account to which it shall credit an amount equal to twenty-five percent (25%) of such employee's unused and accumulated sick leave, while employed by the City, at the rate of pay of such member in effect on the day prior to his retirement or layoff, as the case may be.

 Such account shall be used only to pay health care benefit premiums of such member and spouse at the time of retirement or award of such retirement allowance, to such carrier or carriers as shall be designated by such member. The Board of Administration shall pay such health care benefit premiums from the Health Care Fund, charge the respective members' accounts in the amount thereof, and cease payments on behalf of any such member when the balance in his or her account has been exhausted, or upon the deaths of such member and spouse, whichever shall occur first. The Board of Administration shall periodically notify the departments from which members are retired or laid off and for whom such health care premiums have been paid, of the amount of premiums so paid and the Health Care Fund shall be reimbursed for such premium payments from the proper funds.  Upon written request of a participating member at any time after retirement, the remaining balance of such member's account may be paid to said member and the Board of Administration shall cease payment of health care benefit premiums for said member. In the event of the member's death, his or her designated beneficiary may request and receive a refund of any remaining account balance.

 Section 2. Any act made consistent with the authority and prior to the effective date of this ordinance are hereby ratified and confirmed.

 Section 3. This ordinance shall take effect and be in force thirty (30) days from and after its passage and approval; but if not approved by the Mayor with ten (10) days of its presentation, it shall take effect in accordance with Municipal Code 1.04.020.
