 13. Racial/sexual harassment and/or acts of discrimination that are prohibited by federal, state, or local laws; or,

 14. Other offenses of parallel gravity.

 G.

 H. Conviction of a crime shall not disqualify a person from City employment, except where the conviction is for conduct reasonably related to the work the applicant would be performing for the City, and the conviction is less than five (5) years old.

Examples of major disciplinary offenses are provided in Section 4.04.230F. Such a corrective action process will replace verbal warnings and/or written reprimands, except in those instances where a verbal warning or a written reprimand is appropriate discipline because of the presence of mitigating circumstances following a determination that an employee has committed a major disciplinary offense.

 Section 3. Any acts made consistent with the authority and prior to the effective date of this ordinance are hereby ratified and confirmed.

 Section 4. This ordinance shall take effect and be in force thirty (30) days from and after its approval by the Mayor, but if not approved and returned by the Mayor within ten (10) days after presentation, it shall take effect as provided by Municipal Code Section 1.04.020.
