 AN ORDINANCE amending Seattle Municipal Code Section 4.20.300, Payment for performance of out-of-class duties, to provide the same retroactivity provisions for non-represented employees as were implemented in collective bargaining agreements signed in July 1996 and after.

 WHEREAS the out-of-class provisions codified at Seattle Municipal Code Section 4.20.300 were the result of an agreement reached by a Labor/Management Task Force on service efficiencies in December 1994; and

 WHEREAS it was the intention of City management that these provisions would be implemented as consistently as possible for all eligible employees; therefore

 BE IT ORDAINED BY THE CITY OF SEATTLE AS FOLLOWS:

 Section 1. Seattle Municipal Code Section 4.20.300, Ordinance 97330 as last amended by Ordinance 117961, is further amended as follows:

 A. Except as otherwise provided in authorized collective bargaining agreements, qualified employees, assigned by proper authority to perform the ongoing duties and accept the responsibilities of a higher-paid classification in order to avoid a significant interruption of work or services, shall be paid at the rate established for such higher-paid classification as in promotion while performing such duties. Each out-of-class assignment is limited to six (6) months unless an extension is authorized by the appointing authority. Appropriate reasons for considering the assignment of out- of-class duties include:

 1. Absence of a position incumbent;

 2. Peak workload periods;

 3. Position vacancy; or

 4. Completion of a special project.

 B. An employee whose primary job title is eligible for overtime pay shall perform the ongoing duties of a higher-paid classification for a minimum of four (4) consecutive hours to be eligible for the higher pay rate. An employee whose primary job title is not eligible for overtime shall perform such duties for a minimum of two (2) consecutive weeks to be eligible for the higher pay rate.

 1. Hours worked in an out-of-class assignment, including any hours in an assignment that was in effect on January 20, 1996, will be credited toward salary step placement in the event the employee who was so assigned is promoted, or his or her positions reclassified, to the same class as the out-of-class assignment, within twelve (12) months of the end of such out-of-class assignment.

 2. When an employee is assigned to perform the same out-of-class duties on a full-time, continuous basis for twelve (12) months or longer, he or she will receive a step increment in the higher salary range; provided, that he or she has not already received an increment because of increases to the primary pay rate; provided further, that such increment does not exceed the top step of the higher salary range. This provision shall apply to any hours worked in a continuous assignment prior to January 20, 1996 when such assignment was still in effect on January 20, 1996, and shall apply to all assignments made on or after January 20, 1996.

 C. When an employee or officer serves as acting head of a department or office, payment for the performance of such higher duties shall be as follows:

 1. If the employee or officer is the highest-ranking unsubordinated employee, he or she shall receive his or her regular salary, plus, for all hours worked as acting head, the difference between his or her regular salary and the lowest salary step of the higher position.

 2. If the Mayor designates someone other than the highest-ranking unsubordinated employee to be acting department or office head, the rate of compensation will be calculated as in promotion.

 D. Compensation for acting head assignments will be paid for up to twelve (12) months after the occurrence of a vacancy. An acting head assignment may continue for up to ninety (90) days of any City Council rejection of a nomination to fill a department or office head vacancy and will terminate when such vacancy is filled on a permanent basis.

 E. An employee who is assigned to perform in an acting capacity the duties, and to accept the responsibilities, of the principal staff assistant to any multi-member City administrative board or commission, will be compensated as in SMC Section 4.20.300A.

 Section 2. Any acts made consistent with the authority and prior to the effective date of this ordinance are hereby ratified and confirmed.

 Section 3. This ordinance shall take effect and be in force thirty (30) days from and after its passage and approval, if approved by the Mayor; but if not approved by the Mayor within ten (10) days after presentation, it shall take effect as provided by Municipal Code Section 1.04.020.
