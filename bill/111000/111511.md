 WHEREAS, Ordinance 117946 authorized the Mayor or Director of Housing and Human Services ("Director") to submit an offer to purchase certain land at 1701 28th Avenue South to the United States General Services Administration; and

 WHEREAS, Ordinance 117947 appropriated funds for the purchase of such land from the United States General Services Administration; and

 WHEREAS, Ordinance 117947 authorized the Mayor or Director to enter into a Conditional Contract for Sale of Land ("Contract") with Homesight, by which such land would be sold to HomeSight for development if acquired by The City of Seattle, and authorized the Director to defer payment and to accept a promissory note and Deed of Trust on the property at the time of conveyance; and

 WHEREAS, financial analysis by HomeSight indicates that the residual value of the land, when developed with housing at prices affordable to low and moderate-income first-time home buyers, is less than the price of the land established in the Contract; and

 WHEREAS, the City seeks to establish terms of sale which will make the project feasible for HomeSight without the need for additional appropriations; Now, Therefore,

Payment of principal on the purchase price in excess of $280,000 shall be deferred and may be forgiven, in accordance with the terms of the promissory note and Deed of Trust, in order to assure that at least 13 homes developed on Parcels 42 and 42A are affordable to low-income home buyers.
