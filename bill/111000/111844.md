 WHEREAS, the City of Seattle is desirous of reducing the number of authorizing ordinances for transportation grant agreements;

 NOW THEREFORE,

 BE IT ORDAINED BY THE CITY OF SEATTLE AS FOLLOWS:

 Section 1. The Mayor or his or her designee is hereby authorized each year to submit grants applications to, execute grant agreements with, and accept grant funds from the various local, state and federal funding sources that are associated in an adopted Transportation Capital Improvement Program ("TCIP") with one or more capital improvement projects in the TCIP. The grant funds from each such source, when received, are hereby accepted and shall be deposited into the Transportation Fund, to be used for the Capital Improvement projects identified in the then-current TCIP and associated in the TCIP with that fund source.

 Section 2. The Director of Seattle Transportation shall submit quarterly reports to the Chair of the Transportation Committee outlining TCIP approved activities by quarter and year to date totals as follows:

 what Capital Improvement projects in the current TCIP have received grant funding;

 the total funding from all sources for those projects;

 year to date actual grant funds received versus projected; what future projects are being submitted for grant funding for the next fiscal quarter with proposed grant funding amounts.

 Section 3. Seattle Transportation will provide quarterly reports on anticipated grant applications for the next fiscal year with proposed grant funding amounts. This will not preclude the Mayor or his or her designee to submit grant applications, execute agreements with, and accept grant funds from various local, state and federal funding sources that may arise after a quarterly report has been submitted. In the event of such an occurrence, the Chair of Transportation Committee shall be notified and briefed as to the nature of the proposed grant funding and the related project(s). Those projects and funds would be included in the next quarterly report.

 Section 4. Any acts made consistent with the authority and prior to the effective date of this ordinance are hereby ratified and confirmed.

 Section 5. This ordinance shall take effect and be in force thirty (30) days from and after its approval by the Mayor, but if not approved by the Mayor within ten (10) days after presentation, it shall take effect as provided by Municipal Code Section 1.04.020.
