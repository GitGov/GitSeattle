 SECTION 1. Effective January 1, 1998, Seattle Municipal Code 22.901J - Table 16 (part of Section 2 of Ordinance 117405, as amended by Section 15 of Ordinance 118398) is amended as follows:

 SEATTLE-KING COUNTY DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH

 Fuel gas piping4,5 ~~$57.00~~$75.00  for one (1) through four (4) outlets, and ~~$8.00~~$10.00 for each additional outlet. Minimum of ~~$57.00~~$75.00 shall be nonrefundable.

 Notes to Table 16:

 1. Renewal of a furnace permit shall be charged at the rate of one-half (1/2) times the Base Fee.

 2. See Table 17 for rates for burners installed in boilers.

 3. Fees shall be charged for furnaces when they are applied for without plans. No fee shall be charged for furnaces when they are included in plans for a mechanical air-handling system submitted for a mechanical permit.

 4. Fees for fuel gas piping shall be collected by the Director of Public Health. The basic fee for gas piping installations shall be ~~Fifty-seven Dollars ($57.00~~Seventy-five Dollars ($75.00) and shall not apply to the installation of any domestic hot-water heaters or any other domestic gas-fired appliance connected to a plumbing system whenever such appliance or heater is included in a plumbing installation for which a basic plumbing permit has been assessed.

 5. A reinspection fee for fuel gas piping of Forty Dollars ($40.00) may be assessed for each inspection when such portion of work for which inspection is called is not complete or when corrections called for are not made. This is not to be interpreted as requiring inspection fees the first time a job is rejected for failure to comply with the requirements of this Code, but as controlling the practice of calling for inspection or reinspection.

 Reinspection fees may be assessed when the permit is not properly posted on the work site, the work to be inspected is not under test, and for failure to make required corrections. To obtain a reinspection the applicant shall file an application therefor in writing upon a form furnished for that purpose, and pay the reinspection fee in accordance with this section. In instances in which reinspection fees have been assessed, no additional inspection of the work will be performed until the required fees have been paid.

 SECTION 2. Effective date. This ordinance shall take effect and be in force beginning on the later of the following dates: (1) the date the amendments to King County code section 16.32.085 governing gas piping fees as proposed in King County Council Proposed No. 97-621 in the form in which it existed on November 5, 1997, become effective, and 2(a) if this ordinance is approved by the Mayor and returned within ten (10) days after presentation, thirty (30) days from and after the approval of this ordinance by the Mayor, or (b) if this ordinance is not approved and returned by the Mayor within ten (10) days after presentation, the date provided by Municipal Code Section 1.04.020 for its effectiveness.
