 AN ORDINANCE relating to economic development; approving the 1997 Seattle Jobs Initiative Plan; authorizing the acceptance of additional funds from the Annie E. Casey Foundation and additional matching grants; making additional appropriations from such funds and earnings thereon; decreasing an appropriation in the 1997 budget of Finance General and reappropriating that expenditure authority for the Office of Economic Development and Department of Housing and Human Services for the Seattle Jobs Initiative; and amending Ordinance 117964.

 WHEREAS, Resolution 29140, adopted by the Seattle City Council on May 22, 1995, authorized The City of Seattle to submit a grant application to the Annie E. Casey Foundation to develop a better system for linking disadvantaged people to livable wage jobs; and

 WHEREAS, Seattle was one of six cities selected by the Annie E. Casey Foundation to participate in an eight and one half year demonstration aimed at reforming public and private jobs-related systems in order to improve the long term functioning of the labor market for disadvantaged adults; and

 WHEREAS, Ordinance 117964, adopted by the Seattle City Council on December 18, 1995 authorized the City of Seattle to enter into an agreement with the Annie E. Casey Foundation to accept funds up to $204,000 for the planning phase for the Seattle Jobs Initiative; and

 WHEREAS, the Annie E. Casey Jobs Initiative required the city to secure a cash match in the amount of $180,000 during the 17 month planning period and Ordinance 117964 authorized the Director of OED to accept gifts and grants for the Seattle Jobs Initiative from private and public sources up to $180,000, and that match has been accomplished; and

 WHEREAS, the Annie E. Casey Foundation has increased its funding for the planning phase by $160,000; and

 WHEREAS; upon approval of the City of Seattle's Strategic Investment Plan the Annie E. Casey Foundation will release funding for the implementation phase of the Jobs Initiative program in an amount up to $700,000 per year; and

 WHEREAS, the Annie E. Casey Foundation requires that at least $350,000 per year of matching funds be raised for the Seattle Jobs Initiative, and that amount has been raised for 1997 from Boeing, Microsoft, Wells Fargo, U.S. West, the Seattle Foundation, the Medina Foundation, and the NW Area Foundation; and the Executive has stated his intention that matching funds for future years will come from private sources; and

 WHEREAS, in the 1997 Adopted budget the City Council approved in concept the Mayor's proposed "Families and Jobs Opportunity Fund" to provide for an employment focused response to the Welfare Reform legislation that was signed into law by President Clinton on August 22, 1996, and the Council therefore appropriated One Million Two Hundred Fifty Thousand Dollars ($1,250,000) (in addition to $250,000 intended to assist naturalization efforts) to the Department of Finance General with the intent that this amount be spent after approval of an implementation plan; and

 WHEREAS, prior to allowing expenditures of the "Family and Jobs Opportunity Fund" the Council required the Executive to prepare a 1997 operating plan and submit it to Council for its approval by February 28, 1997; and

 WHEREAS the Executive has submitted the required plan for the 1997 operations of the Seattle Jobs Initiative, which is proposed to be funded by both the Casey grant matching funds and the Families and Jobs Opportunity Fund as well as other sources previously appropriated by Council; and

 WHEREAS the Seattle Jobs Initiative has been developed with significant input from organized labor; and

 WHEREAS, organized Labor will be an important partner in the success of the initiative; and

 WHEREAS, Seattle Jobs Initiative will develop a memorandum of understanding with the King County Labor Council AFL-CIO by June 1, 1997 detailing the operating principles of the project which will protect existing workers from displacement or wage, hour, or benefit reduction; and

 WHEREAS, organized Labor will work with Seattle Jobs Initiative to develop and implement effective sector strategies that promote livable wages with benefits and long-term job retention for Seattle Jobs Initiative participants and to assist Seattle Jobs Initiative by increasing access to apprenticeships and other livable wage jobs. This work is consistent with Labor's efforts to increase living standards of workers.
