 WHEREAS, under said Warranty Deed Mr. Roggensees neglected to reserve an easement over and across the land conveyed to the City for the benefit of the remainder of his property, thereby leaving the remainder without any permanent legal access; and,

 WHEREAS, the City Light Department has reviewed the owner's easement request and has determined that an easement for ingress, egress and underground utilities over and across the City's right of way in the requested location will not present a hazard to or interfere with the construction, operation, maintenance, patrol and repair of the Skagit transmission system; Now, Therefore,
