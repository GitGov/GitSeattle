 AN ORDINANCE adopting a new compensation plan for exempt Legislative Assistants in the Legislative Department.

 WHEREAS the City is evaluating overall changes to its classification and compensation systems, and has committed to appropriate systems redesign pursuant to the following principles: (a) increased job flexibility with avenues of advancement via skills expansion, performance excellence, and technical expertise as appropriate; (b) objective and understandable job measurement tools; (c) alignment with the labor markets in which the City competes for employees; (d) a performance pay component; and (e) employee and managerial accountability and authority for work performance; and

 WHEREAS the success of this systems redesign effort depends in part on the ability to tailor job classification and compensation systems to meet the unique needs of specific employing units or employee groups; Now Therefore

 BE IT ORDAINED BY THE CITY OF SEATTLE AS FOLLOWS:

 Section 1.

 A. The following salary bands are established for the title Legislative Assistant, effective November 17, 1997.

 Band 1 = $20,000 ($ 9.58 per hour) to $40,000 ($19.16 per hour)

 Band 2 = $35,000 ($16.76 per hour) to $70,000 ($33.52 per hour)

 B. Each Legislative Assistant will be assigned, by the City Councilmember to whom he or she reports, a salary on one (1) of the two (2) bands established in subsection A. Such assignment may be based on the City Councilmember's assessment of the type, level and complexity of the work to be performed, and comparison of the salary paid to other City positions that are assigned substantially similar work. Provided, the City Councilmember may also consider such factors as

 the Legislative Assistant's qualifications, skills, and experience and any work characteristics that may be unique to the Legislative Department, or in accordance with standards and practices specific to Legislative Department needs.

 C. Current position incumbents may be transitioned to the new pay bands at their current rates of pay.

 D. The Personnel Director, upon request by any City Councilmember, shall provide guidance regarding job design and appropriate compensation for specific bodies of work in accordance with general City practice.

 Section 2.

 A. In lieu of individual position authority for Legislative Assistants, each City Councilmember shall receive an annual salary budget. Within that budgeted lid, each City Councilmember may hire up to three (3) full time equivalent positions, but no combination of staff may exceed the budgeted lid. All staff will be assigned the ordinance title of Legislative Assistant, and may be given any working title deemed appropriate by the City Councilmember to whom they report.

 B. The budgeted lid will be increased by a percentage change equivalent to any cost of living adjustment awarded to nonrepresented, exempt City employees who are compensated under the City's standard salary schedule and compensation plan. Each City Councilmember, at his or her discretion, may use the additional funds to

 increase the base salaries of current staff, hire additional regular or intermittent staff, or to award lump sum performance recognition payments to current staff. Any lump sum performance recognition payments shall be considered as part of regular compensation, prorated annually, for purposes of withholding retirement

 contributions and determining retirement benefits for affected employees who are members of the City Employees' Retirement System.

 C. Each City Councilmember shall determine the basis for progression through and between salary bands for his or her subordinate staff. Progression may be on the basis of changes to the scope, level and complexity of a position's assigned duties and responsibilities, employee performance, employee skills enhancement, or a combination thereof. Current incumbents shall be evaluated for purposes of post-implementation placement and subsequent progression no later than March 31, 1998.

 D. The compensation program legislated herein shall be administered substantially in accord with the Legislative Assistants Compensation Plan Administrative Guidelines, which are incorporated by this reference.

 Section 3. Any acts made consistent with the authority and prior to the effective date of this ordinance are hereby ratified and confirmed.

 Section 4. This ordinance shall take effect and be in force thirty (30) days from and after its passage and approval; but if not approved by the Mayor within ten (10) days of its presentation, it shall take effect in accordance with Municipal Code 1.04.020.

 LEGISLATIVE ASSISTANT COMPENSATION PLAN ADMINISTRATIVE GUIDELINES

 The following guidelines are intended to facilitate the implementation and administration of a new compensation plan for Legislative Assistants. These guidelines may be revised by the City Council at any time based on Councilmembers' agreement to administer the legislated compensation plan in a manner other than provided herein.

 Program Specifications

 The Legislative Assistant Compensation Plan will consist of two salary bands. In 1997 dollars, Band 1 will extend from $20,000 ($9.58/hour) to $40,000 ($19.16/hour) and Band 2 will extend from $35,000 ($16.76/hour) to $70,000 ($33.52/hour). Each Legislative Assistant will be assigned to one of these bands based on the type, level, and complexity of work to be assigned; salaries for other City jobs that are assigned substantially similar work; and other criteria to be determined and identified by individual Councilmembers.

 Individual Councilmembers may hire up to three appointed, non- intermittent FTE under the Plan. Actual numbers and compensation levels of staff shall be limited by the imposition of a compensation budget lid, which shall be identified in the Legislative Department's biennial budget. The lid includes actual salary costs and benefits.

 Any intermittent or project staff costs must also come out of the compensation budget. Intermittent and project staff need not be placed on one of the two bands; they would be paid the rate established by ordinance for the body of work to be assigned to them. Intermittent employees receive premium pay in lieu of benefits and paid leave.

 Councilmembers may divert savings from their salary budget to general office line items, but may not divert office budget savings into their salary budgets. This is to prevent the establishment of unsustainable salary expectations.

 Transition

 Councilmembers will evaluate their Legislative Assistant positions, whether they are staffed or vacant, for placement on one of the two new bands. This will require the development of job descriptions and the selection of appropriate benchmarks. Personnel Division's Class/Comp staff will provide assistance upon request of the individual Councilmember.

 Existing Legislative Assistants may be grandfathered in at their current salaries, if actual placement on the band will provide a lower salary than they have been receiving for the performance of their assigned duties. Once the decision is made to grandfather staff into the new system, the individual's salary cannot be lowered unless there is a commensurate reduction in the nature, scope and complexity of duties assigned.

 New staff who are hired before the compensation program is formally adopted will be "benchmarked" for placement in the program. Existing City titles and pay rates may be used to compensate them (e.g., Planning & Development Specialist I in lieu of Legislative Assistant) until the adopting legislation becomes effective. At that time, they will be formally appointed to the Legislative Assistant title.

 Wage Progression Criteria

 Councilmembers may adopt for their staff a wage progression method based on length of service, achievement of performance objectives, or skills enhancement, or any combination thereof. Within individual Councilmembers' offices, the same wage progression method should be used for all staff who are assigned substantially similar kinds of work.

 Criteria for wage progression must be developed and communicated to affected staff upon program implementation. For example, if a Councilmember chooses to provide for wage progression based on length of service, he or she must identify the increments of time to be rewarded as well as the percentage increase to be paid. If a Councilmember chooses to provide for wage progression based on skills enhancement, he or she must identify the skills that staff will be expected to learn and demonstrate, and must develop a schedule and development plan for each staffmember.

 Whichever method is selected, Councilmembers need to be aware of the salary budget lid when making commitments for salary increases.

 Base Salary Increases or Lump Sum Payments

 Individual Councilmembers may elect whether to grant wage increases as part of base salary or as lump sum payments that are not added to base. Within the City's regular salary structure, increases added to base pay average 3.4%, and are granted every 12 months (except for the first increase which is awarded at six months). If Councilmembers grant base pay increases for reasons other than length of service, they should be careful not to schedule them any more frequently than they plan to evaluate employees. Again, consistency across Council offices is not critical, but consistency within individual Councilmember's staffs is-particularly if staff are performing substantially the same level of work.

 If wage increases are to be added to base salary, it may be advisable to identify a salary range on the appropriate band that clearly provides for the maximum rate that will be paid for a specific job. Depending upon an individual's qualifications, a Councilmember might hire a Legislative Assistant at the low end of that artificially imposed range and allow him or her to progress to the top based on the criteria selected, or may hire near the top of the range with the understanding that no significant wage progression is anticipated.

 If wage increases are to be paid as noncumulative lump sums, the employing Councilmember may want to benchmark the job at the "fully qualified" level and hire a Legislative Assistant who can perform at that standard.

 Wage increases are limited to no more than 8% per year per employee whether given as base salary increments or lump sum payments, or a combination thereof.

 Cost of Living Adjustments

 Annual cost-of-living adjustments that may be awarded to other exempt, nonrepresented employees in the City will be added to the salary lid for Legislative Assistants. Individual employees will not receive automatic cost-of-living increases, but Councilmembers may award an equivalent increase to their staff if desired.

 Program Management

 One of the primary purposes of the new compensation plan is to provide staffing flexibility to City Councilmembers. A typical outcome of increased flexibility is heightened need for "hands-on" management. This will be particularly true for Councilmembers who decide to set pay based on performance or skills enhancement, rather than for length of service.

 To ensure the success of this new compensation plan, the following steps are highly recommended:

 Consult with the Administrative Services Manager (Eric Ishino) to determine the amount of the compensation budget available to you for 1998.

 Prepare descriptions of the jobs you want to hire for.

 Consult with the Personnel Division's Class/Comp Unit (Lidia Santiesteban, Director-6-9081) to determine an appropriate pay range (within the band) for each position.

 Within the recommended range, identify a suitable starting salary for the individual(s) you intend to hire.

 Determine whether salary costs will increase over the course of the year-that is, do you plan to increase base pay for performance, skills enhancement, or other reasons? If you plan to award noncumulative lump sum payments instead, what percentage of base salary shall represent the greatest potential payment?

 Calculate your total potential costs to ensure your budget will cover your plans.

 Communicate your tailored compensation plan and your expectations to your staff.

 Other issues to keep in mind-

 If the duties that you have described for any of your subordinate positions undergo significant changes in scope, nature or complexity over the course of time, you may want to have the benchmark re- examined by the Class/Comp Unit.

 If you plan to pay employees for performance, you must develop criteria, objectives, and an appraisal methodology.

 If you plan to pay employees for skills enhancement, you will need to identify desired skills, develop a training program, and determine the value of skills mastery.

 The City provides full benefits coverage for part-time employees (anybody who works an average of 20 hours or more per week over the course of the calendar year). If you allow job sharing or have other staffing plans that include part-time employment, be aware of the extra benefits costs.

 This compensation plan does not require consistency across Council offices. If you want a high degree of consistency, you might consider designating a staffperson from the Legislative Department's Administrative Services Unit, for example, to review compensation decisions.
