 AN ORDINANCE relating to uses of alternative Public Works Contracting procedures, as provided for in Chapter 39.10 of the Revised Code of Washington, and amending the Public Works portions of the Seattle Municipal Code to accommodate use of those alternative Public Works Contracting Procedures.

 WHEREAS, recent creation of RCW 39.10 enables the City to utilize several different alternative Public Works Contracting procedures, under certain specific conditions, and with the specific determination of the City Council;

 WHEREAS, those alternative Public Works Contracting procedures in part involve awarding of public works construction contracts as a point substantially before actual construction starts;

 WHEREAS, the Public Works provisions of the Seattle Municipal Code did not envision such procedures and contain specific requirements regarding the existence of full project appropriation that would prevent utilization of such alternative Public Works Contracting procedures;

 NOW THEREFORE BE IT ORDAINED BY THE CITY OF SEATTLE AS FOLLOWS:

 Section 1. The Seattle Municipal Code, section 20.48.030 Funds to be Available Before Entering Into Contract, is amended to add additional sentences as follows: For contracts executed pursuant to Chapter 39.10 RCW, the Director or department head is authorized to enter into contracts without such certification, provided that no phase of any public work may be started unless sufficient funds have been appropriated to cover the full cost and expense of completing that phase.

 Section 2. This ordinance shall take effect and be in force thirty (30) days from and after its approval by the Mayor, but if not approved and returned by the Mayor within ten (10) days after presentation, it shall take effect as provided by Municipal Code Section 1.04.020. Passed by the City Council the _______ day of _________________________, 199____, and signed by me in open session in authentication of its passage this _______ day of _________________________, 199____. _________________________________________ President of the City Council
