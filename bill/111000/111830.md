 ORDINANCE .

 AN ORDINANCE relating to Emergency Medical Services; authorizing execution, pursuant to the Interlocal Cooperation Act, of an agreement with King County regarding the allocation of property tax revenues generated by a King County six-year voter-approved tax levy for emergency medical services, and approving such King County tax levy.

 WHEREAS, King County desires to place before the qualified electors of King County a ballot proposition authorizing the County to levy an additional regular property tax in the sum of twenty-nine cents per thousand dollars of assessed valuation each year, for six consecutive years, on all taxable property within King County for the support of emergency medical services, pursuant to the powers granted to it in RCW 84.52.069; and

 WHEREAS, RCW 84.52.069 does not permit a County-wide excess tax levy for emergency medical services to be placed on the ballot until after the legislative authority of every city having a population in excess of fifty thousand within such county has approved such action; and

 WHEREAS, King County intends to place on the ballot a proposition to impose a tax levy at less than the maximum tax rate allowed by law for the providing of emergency medical services, thereby allowing the City to impose its own emergency medical service tax levy, if it so desires; and

 WHEREAS, King County proposes to carry out its obligation to provide emergency medical services on a County-wide basis by, among other actions, reimbursing expenses incurred in the City's independent emergency medical services program through the allocating and transferring to the City of that portion of the tax receipts generated by such County tax levy that is attributable to taxable property within the City, NOW, THEREFORE,

 Section 2. As requested by the Mayor, the Mayor is hereby authorized to execute, for and on behalf of The City of Seattle, an agreement with King County substantially in the form of the attached "Interlocal Cooperation Agreement for Allocation of Property Tax Revenues between The City of Seattle and King County."

 Section 3. Any acts consistent with the authority and prior to the effective date of this ordinance are hereby ratified and confirmed.

 Section 5. This ordinance shall take effect and be in force thirty (30) days from and after its approval by the Mayor, but if not approved and returned by the Mayor within ten (10) days after presentation, it shall take effect as provided by Municipal Code Section 1.04.020.

 BETWEEN

 THE CITY OF SEATTLE

 AND

 KING COUNTY

 THIS AGREEMENT is entered into pursuant to the "Interlocal Cooperation Act" codified as Ch. 39.34 RCW, by and between The City of Seattle ("The City") and King County ("The County");

 WITNESSETH:

 WHEREAS, the County desires to place before the qualified electors of King County a ballot proposition authorizing the County to levy an additional regular property tax in the sum of 29 cents per thousand dollars of assessed valuation each year for six consecutive years on all taxable property within King County for the support of emergency medical services pursuant to the powers granted to it in RCW 84.52.069 and

 WHEREAS, the City operates and funds an emergency medical services program which is independent from the County's program; and

 WHEREAS, a portion of the revenues to be collected pursuant to said levy will be attributable to taxable property located within the legal boundaries of the City; and

 WHEREAS, the parties hereto desire to reimburse and transfer to the City for the support of its emergency medical services program all revenues to be collected pursuant to said levy from the taxable property located within the legal boundaries of the City of Seattle; and

 WHEREAS, the County has determined that the reimbursement and transfer agreement set forth above will not affect the County's ability to provide emergency medical service throughout the county; and

 WHEREAS, RCW 84.52.069 provides that no County levy proposal may be placed on the ballot without approval of the legislative authority of the City;

 Now, Therefore, the parties agree as follows:

 1. The County shall submit to the qualified electors of King County at a special election to be held therein on November 4, 1997 in conjunction with the state-wide general election to be held on the same date or at such other time as the County may determine, subject to the provisions of RCW 29.13.010 regarding the calling of special county elections, a proposition authorizing the County to levy an additional regular property tax each year for six years beginning in 1997 for collection beginning in 1998 on taxable property within the County in the sum of 29 cents per thousand dollars of assessed valuation pursuant to RCW 84.52.069, for expenses incurred in the provision of emergency medical services.

 2. This Agreement shall commence upon its signing by both parties. Upon the approval by the qualified electors of King County of the additional regular property tax levy as set forth in RCW 84.52.069, the King County Council shall by ordinance impose said levy at a rate of 29 cents per thousand dollars of assessed valuation. The County shall levy said voter approved regular property tax beginning in 1997, and each year thereafter for a total of six consecutive years. This Agreement shall terminate on the later of December 31, 2003 or when all property taxes levied by King County under this agreement have been collected and the proper share transferred to the City.

 3. The County shall reimburse and transfer to the City all revenues collected pursuant to said levy from taxable property located within the legal boundaries of the City at the levy rate authorized herein.

 4. Reimbursement and transfer of the revenues set forth in Section 3 above, shall be administered by the King County Office of Finance in the manner and at such times as revenues produced pursuant to levies authorized by RCW 84.52.043.

 5. All revenues received pursuant to said levy and this Agreement shall be used only for the provision of emergency medical services as specified in RCW 84.52.069 (3) and shall be deposited into a special revenue account established by the City for that purpose.

 6. In return for the reimbursement and transfer as set forth in Section 3 above, the City gives its approval by ordinance for the submission to the qualified electors of King County of the County-wide six-year additional property tax levy proposition for emergency medical services set forth in Section 1 above.

 7. Nothing in this Agreement shall be deemed to prohibit the City from levying an annual tax levy pursuant to RCW 84.52.052 or 84.52.069, to fund emergency medical services.

 8. The parties hereto expressly reserve for themselves the right to amend this agreement. No amendment hereto will be effective unless it is in writing and signed by the authorized representatives of the parties hereto.
