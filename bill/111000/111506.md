 11.16.125 Director of Engineering - Authority-~~subject to~~appeal to Street Use Appeals Board.

 B. To close or authorize closure of any alley for entry or travel by the general public in order to make repairs or maintenance of the street; to accommodate construction on abutting properties or of utilities in the alley or a special use of an abutter under permit; to protect the public from a health or sanitation hazard, a hazard or obstruction in the alley or an unsafe structure on abutting property; or based on a recommendation of the Chief of Police that such a closure is necessary in order to prevent criminal activity occurring in or emanating from the alley. Unless otherwise ordered, the alley shall remain open to access by the following persons: owners and occupants of the abutting properties and their guests; agents of utilities with facilities in the alley or serving the abutting properties; government employees and emergency personnel in the performance of their duties; and permittees under a street use permit issued pursuant to Title 15. Upon ordering the closure, the Director shall cause the area to be posted with signs or barricades stating the hours of closure;

 Section Section 11.16.317 of the Seattle Municipal Code (Ordinance 108200, Section 2, last amended by Ordinance 117235, Section 2) is amended as follows:

 SMC 11.16.317 Establishing, expanding and reducing restricted parking zones.

A. The Director of the Engineering Department may establish a restricted parking zone whenever seventy-five percent (75%) or more of the capacity of the streets available for parking in such designated area is generally occupied during regular business hours or any consecutive eight (8) hour period during evenings or during any consecutive eight (8) hour period on both Saturdays and Sundays; at least twenty-five percent (25%) of the vehicles parked on the street in the area during such hours are not owned by residents of the designated area; a petition signed by, or a survey indicating that, a majority of the residents in the designated area approves the restricted parking zone; and the public interest would be served. In cases where the criteria listed above are not all met, the Director of the Engineering Department is authorized to establish a restricted parking zone when, in his or her judgment, the parking problem will be ameliorated by a restricted parking zone and the public interest would be served.

B. The ~~Director of the~~ Engineering Department's decision to establish or not to establish a restricted parking zone may be ~~appealed to the Street Use Appeals Board~~ subject to review orreconsideration within fifteen (15) days of publication in the Seattle Daily Journal of Commerce and/or local newspaper. ~~The decision of the Street Use Appeals Board is final.~~~~Appeals~~Requests for review or reconsideration may be initiated by residents, business owners, or employees in the proposed RPZ.  On review or reconsideration, the Director, or his or her designee, shall conduct a public hearing before the Director makes a final decision.  Grounds for ~~appeal~~review or reconsideration may include the validity of the study; the stringency of the parking restrictions; the boundaries of the restricted parking zone; and violations of Policies and Procedures Concerning the Implementation of Residential Parking Zones.

C. The Director may modify boundaries or hours of an existing RPZ~~A restricted parking zone may be expanded~~ consistent with Policies and Procedures Concerning the Implementation of Residential Parking Zones.

D. A restriction of parking shall first take effect on a street segment when it is signed or posted, and shall cease when the signs or posting are removed pursuant to lawful order; provided, that vandalism or destruction of parking control signs shall not affect the validity of a restriction upon parking on any street segment designated by the Director of the Engineering Department if other signs or traffic control devices give notice that parking in the street segment is restricted.

 Section Section 15.04.037 of the Seattle Municipal Code (Ordinance 117569, Section 5) is hereby amended as follows:

 SMC 15.04.037 Overview of indemnity deposit, accounts, escrow, insurance,

 and surety bond.~~--Appeals to Street Use Appeals Board~~

 A. Sections 15.04.040 through 15.04.060 are coordinated elements of a package of protections intended to assist the City in collection of expenses charged under this ordinance and costs associated with a use under permit; to assure performance of the requirements of this ordinance and the covenants or conditions in a permit; to place on the user the risks associated with the use and provide a degree of financial responsibility in the event of an accident or injury; and, when their use is completed, to have public place restored to at least as good a condition as before the use began; and thereby further compliance and protect the public treasury. The City's acceptance of an indemnity deposit, an escrow account, a surety bond, or insurance or the establishment of a subaccount in the City Treasury in favor of a permittee do not limit a permittee's liability to the amount thereof.

 B. Sections 15.04.040 through 15.04.060 relate to each other as follows:

 1. A deposit with the City under Section 15.04.040 provides a source of funds, held by the City, to pay probable City expenditures arising from a proposed use and/or restoration of the public place after the use, the time of City employees for inspection and Code enforcement, and ancillary City expenses. Annual fees are billed separately.

 2. An escrow account maintained under Section 15.04.042 may be an alternative to a deposit under Section 15.04.040 for amounts at or over One Thousand Dollars ($1,000.00) and/or to providing a surety bond under Section 15.04.044 in an amount up to Ten Thousand Dollars ($10,000.00), or a supplement to either or both of them. It differs from a deposit in that the stakeholder, rather than the City, is a public depository; interest on the deposit accrues to the account, rather than to the City; and withdrawals from the account are governed by the escrow agreement rather than by City rules on guaranty deposits.

 3. A subaccount under Section 15.04.050 establishes a balance with the City in favor of the applicant or permittee against which a City department may deduct fees and charges as they occur, including annual fees and deposits for particular permits.

 4. A surety bond under Section 15.04.044 provides a promise by a licensed surety company, within the limits and according to the terms of the bond, to perform work or pay the City's expenses to perform the work in the event of the permittee's default. A surety bond is not a substitute for providing the City public liability insurance for any tortious injury.

 5. Liability insurance under Section 15.04.045 protects the City as an additional insured from public liability as a result of an accident, injury, or damage arising from the use of a public place, and assists in making permittees financially responsible for meeting liabilities that may arise from their use of public places.

 6. The covenant for indemnity under Section 15.04.060 holds the City harmless from any and all claims, actions, or damages. It applies independently of the foregoing and authorizes a tender of defense by the City to the permittee in event of a claim or lawsuit arising from the use.

 7. Section 15.04.017 empowers an authorized official, when required to do so by a constitutional provision or state law, to waive compliance with any of these sections.

 C. The amount set by an authorizing official for an indemnity deposit, an escrow account or a surety bond, and the correctness of a charge or deduction shown on the City's account statement or made from an escrow account shall be subject to ~~appeal to the Street Use Appeals Board~~review or reconsideration pursuant to SMC 15.04.112.

 Section Section 15.04.045 of the Seattle Municipal Code (Ordinance 90047 Section 10, as last amended by Ordinance 117569, Section 8) is further amended as follows:

 SMC 15.04.045 Liability insurance.

 An applicant for a permit shall maintain in full force and effect during the full period of the permit, public liability insurance in an amount sufficient to cover potential claims for any bodily injury, death, or disability and for property damage, which may arise from or be related to the use allowed by the permit. The insurance policy shall name the City as an additional insured; apply as primary insurance regardless of any insurance which the City may carry; and obligate the insurance company to give notice to both the authorizing official and the City's Risk Manager at least thirty (30) days before any cancellation of the policy. The authorizing official may establish the amount of such insurance, subject to ~~appeal to the Street Use Appeals Board~~ review or reconsideration pursuant to SMC 15.04.112, and unless constitutional liberties prohibit it, may require that the insurance be provided prior to issuance of the permit.

 Section The following new section shall be added to the Seattle Municipal Code:

 SMC 15.04.112 Decisions - Review or Reconsideration

 A person aggrieved by any of the following Engineering Department decisions may timely request the Director to review the decision, or if the decision be that of the Director, to reconsider the decision:

 B. The revision, pursuant to SMC Section 11.16.120.F, of the boundaries of a residential parking zone;

 C. The issuance or revocation, pursuant to SMC Section 11.16.315.B, of permits for parking in a residential parking zone;

 D. The approval or denial, pursuant to SMC Section 15.04.010, of a street use permit;

 I. The approval or denial, pursuant to SMC Section 15.08.080, of a request to construct a street elevator;

 J. The approval or denial, pursuant to SMC Section 15.10.020, of a request for exception to minimum height requirement applicable to marquees, awnings and canopies;

 K. The approval or denial, pursuant to SMC Section 15.10.030, of a request for exception to vertical depth requirement applicable to marquees;

 L. The approval or denial, pursuant to SMC Section 15.12.030, of a request for a permit to hang a banner;

 M. The approval or denial, pursuant to SMC Sections 15.14.040 and 15.14.050, of a request for a permit for a newsstand location not generally permitted by ordinance, or the placement of a newsstand pursuant to Section 15.14.080;

 N. Conditions imposed regarding a permit to move a building or equipment; the assessment and allocation, pursuant to Section 15.28.050, of the costs of relocating wires or cables; and the amount of City costs assessed pursuant to Section 15.28.070;

 O. The determination of the cost of removal of a handbill, sign or poster pursuant to Sections 15.48.120;

 R. A Stop Order of the Director of Engineering pursuant to Sections 15.50.023 or 15.50.025; and

 S. The issuance or denial, pursuant to SMC Chapter 16.60, of a permit to use or occupy any part of a waterway or any part of the land portion of a waterway.

 An aggrieved person may request review or reconsideration by filing a request for review or reconsideration with the Director within ten (10) days of the date of the decision. The request shall identify the decision for which review or reconsideration is requested, the objection(s) to the decision; and the specific alternative being proposed. The Director shall designate a review officer, who shall make a recommendation to the Director. The Director may, at his or her discretion, stay implementation of a decision pending review or reconsideration. The Director's decision on review or reconsideration shall be final.

 Section Section 15.14.050 of the Seattle Municipal Code (Ordinance 90047 Section

 19-E, last amended by Ordinance 117569 Section 38) is further amended as follows:

 SMC 15.14.050 Congestion control.

 A. Without a permit no newsstand shall be placed within one hundred twenty feet (120') of any corner or other location with more than four (4) newsstands, or a modular unit newsstand with a capacity of at least four (4) units, or within one hundred twenty feet (120') of an attended newsstand.

 B. As long as the requirements of Section 15.14.030 are not violated, an authorizing official may defer enforcing the congestion control criteria of subsection A at a location until a complaint is made by a publisher, distributor, property owner, or member of the public.

 C. If a complaint is made that the criteria in subsection A are exceeded, or an application is made for a permit under this section, the authorized official shall determine whether the totality of newsstands at such location will conflict with the requirements of Section 15.14.030. If no such conflict is evident, and the authorizing official using the

 guidelines in Section 15.14.010 shall determine that the placement represents a reasonable accommodation furthering the overall public interest, the authorizing official may issue a permit for such proposed newsstand.

 D. ~~Upon the timely appeal of the issuance or denial by the authorizing official of~~In determining whether to issue or deny a permit for a proposed newsstand under this section, the ~~Street Use Appeals Board~~Director of Engineering shall ~~determine~~consider: (1) whether there is a satisfactory alternate location for such newsstand in the vicinity, and if no such location exists, (2) whether an existing newsstand shall be displaced for such proposed newsstand. When necessary, allocations of space for newsstands at particular locations as provided herein shall be made in a manner which:

 (a) Offers the public convenient access to all publications, whether

 (b) Guarantees to all publishers a reasonable representation of their

 newsstands in public places;

 (c) Provides opportunity for placement of newsstands for new

 publication modular units; and

 (e) Minimizes hardship to applicants denied permits and to publishers

 whose newsstands are displaced.

 Before allocating space at any location, the Director of Engineering ~~or the Street Use Appeals Board, as the case may be,~~ shall afford the publishers affected a reasonable opportunity to do so voluntarily.

 Section Section 15.14.080 of the Seattle Municipal Code (Ordinance 90047 Section 19-H, last amended by Ordinance 117569, Section 40) is amended as follows:
