 WHEREAS, the City owns a 115 kV transmission line that runs between the Boundary Substation to the Bonneville Power Administration's Metaline Falls Tap Line which is known as the Boundary Tap Line, which was built at the time of construction of the Boundary Project to provide service to the construction facilities and site; and

 WHEREAS, on December 20, 1965 the City and the District, executed an agreement relating to the delivery of encroachment power by the City to the District which power is delivered at the District's Box Canyon Substation; and

 WHEREAS, the District is willing to upgrade and reinforce the Boundary Tap Line as well as allow the City to deliver the encroachment power to the District at the Boundary Substation rather than at the Box Canyon Substation in consideration for receiving the use of 50 percent of the capacity of such line; Now, Therefore,
