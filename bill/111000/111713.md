The amount of up to TEN MILLION DOLLARS ($10,000,000) is hereby appropriated from the Housing and Community Development Revenue Sharing Fund for such purpose.

 Section 2. The loan shall be payable upon the earlier of (i) twenty-four (24) months or (ii) demand by the City. The loan shall bear interest at two percent (2%) per annum. Principal shall be payable at the term of the loan, or on such schedule as the OED Director determines is appropriate. The OED Director will require a loan fee, payable to the City, not to exceed 1.0 % of the maximum loan amount, which fee shall be deposited in the Housing and Community Development Revenue Sharing Fund. All or a portion of any fee may be paid to the National Development Council in compensation for consulting services, in accordance with an existing consultant contract and to pay for the City's legal fees and other costs related to the transaction. The OED Director is authorized to cause any remaining portion of such fee to be applied to payment of expenses incurred in the administration of any federally guaranteed or federally funded economic development loan program or program  administered by the OED Director or to be remitted to the City and deposited in the Housing and Community Development Revenue Sharing Fund. The amount of up to ONE HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS ($100,000) is hereby appropriated for such purpose from the Housing and Community Development Revenue Sharing Fund, subject to receipt of such funds in payment of such fee. The loan shall be secured by an irrevocable letter of credit that shall have an outstanding balance, at all times, at least equal to the outstanding loan amount and accrued interest, plus all additional interest that will accrue for the next 30 days. The letter of credit shall be issued by a commercial bank satisfactory to the OED Director and shall be in the form attached to this Ordinance as Exhibit C, with such modifications as the OED Director may deem necessary and appropriate to carry out the intent of this Ordinance.

 Section 5. The OED Director is hereby authorized to take such other actions and execute and deliver such other documents as shall be reasonably necessary or appropriate to carry out the intent of this Ordinance.

 Section 6. Payments of interest on the loan shall be deposited in the Housing and Community Development Revenue Sharing Fund, and may be expended pursuant to any past or future appropriations of CDBG funds, whether in the annual budget or otherwise, unless such other appropriations are limited by their express terms to CDBG program income from other programs.

 Section 7. The Director of the Department of Housing and Human Services is authorized to amend the City of Seattle's 1997 Consolidated Plan and to take such other actions as are appropriate to implement the intent of this ordinance under HUD regulations,
