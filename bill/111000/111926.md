If bonds are to be sold, they shall be in such form, contain such covenants, bear such date or dates, and shall be issued in such amounts and at such times or from time to time as the City Council may direct.

 Such bonds or notes shall be redeemed by the collection of special assessments to be levied upon the property within said district, payable in ten (10) equal annual installments, with interest, or in the alternative, in ten (10) equal annual installments of principal and interest, as the City Council may direct.

 In addition, in the event that an installment payment is delinquent, it shall, until paid, be subject to an additional charge of twenty percent (20%) levied upon the principal and interest due on such installment. Interest on delinquent payment, including penalties, shall continue to be applied until the payment is made.

 Section 6. The City Finance Director is authorized to sell short- term obligations, as authorized by Chapter 39.50 R.C.W., warrants as authorized by R.C.W. 35.45.130, or installment notes as authorized by R.C.W. 35.45.150 (together, "short-term obligations"), up to a maximum of Two Hundred Seven Thousand Eight Hundred Sixty and No/100 Dollars ($207,860.00) outstanding at any time, to provide interim financing for the improvement authorized in Section 1 of this ordinance. Such obligations may bear a fixed rate or variable rate or rates of interest, the variable rate being fixed as a percentage of the most recent prime rate of interest published in the Wall Street Journal before the date of their issuance, but the net effective interest rate shall not exceed five and one half percent (5.5%) per annum.

 The short-term obligations may be paid from the proceeds of local improvement district bonds, from assessment payments, from the proceeds of the issuance of other short-term obligations, or from other City funds made available for that purpose. The short-term obligations shall be drawn on Local Improvement Fund, District No._____, and shall be payable solely out of that fund or the Local Improvement Guaranty Fund.

 The short-term obligations shall be sold in such manner as the City Finance Director, upon the advice of the Debt Management Policy Advisory Committee, may determine.
