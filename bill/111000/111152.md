 WHEREAS, the City-wide Consultant Roster Program was established to improve the efficiency of the consultant selection process; and

 WHEREAS, the Department of Administrative Services has advertised for and selected consultants for the City-wide Consultant Roster Program; and

 WHEREAS, it is in the best interests of the City to provide flexibility for departments to select the most qualified consultants from the Roster Program or through other approved methods; and

 WHEREAS, the City desires to provide contracting opportunities for a wide variety of consultants;

 NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT ORDAINED BY THE CITY OF SEATTLE AS FOLLOWS:

 Section 1. Seattle Municipal Code 3.114.160, subsection B is amended to read as follows:

 B. Consideration.

 1. ~~Except for the circumstances described in SMC Section 3.114.110, a~~A participating department may ~~shall~~ contract ~~only~~ with the consultants on the roster for assignments or projects within the specialty and for services described in the roster on assignments or projects estimated to cost no more than an adjusted amount established pursuant to SMC Section 3.114.140. ~~The foregoing sentence does not limit a participating department's ability to:~~

~~a. Execute amendments to contracts made originally without using the roster for work or services related to the original contracts regardless of the amount of the amendment;~~~~b. Select consultants through the consultant selection process as defined in this chapter, for projects falling generally within a specialty for which there is a roster, but requiring a level of expertise that is not available from the consultants on the certified roster, for which no consultant on the roster is available, or, as determined by the head of the participating department contracting for such services that there is a need for broadening the search for consultant to perform the services;~~~~c. Disregard a roster in order to carry out an applicable procurement regulation mandated by the grant agreement on a project with federal or state assistance;~~
~~d. Execute a contract amendment with the consultant for additional work related to the original roster contract and not foreseen when the roster contract was originally executed, as long as the total contract consideration, including all amendments do not exceed one hundred twenty percent (120%) of the dollar limitation established pursuant to SMC Section 3.114.140, when the original contract was executed.~~

 2. In applying for and accepting placement on a certified roster, a consultant shall agree to maintain a readiness to contract with the City to provide the services for particular assignments or projects contemplated by the solicitation, when and if offered; and, if awarded a contract, the consultant shall agree to complete the assignment or project in a timely and professional manner in accordance with the contract's standard and/or special terms and conditions.

 Section 2. This ordinance shall take effect and be in force thirty (30) days from and after its approval by the Mayor, but if not approved and returned by the Mayor within ten (10) days after presentation, it shall take effect as provided by Municipal Code Section 1.04.020.
