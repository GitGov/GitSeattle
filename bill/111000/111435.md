 Subchapter III Business License Tax

5.44.400~~5.44.030~~ Tax or fee levied.

 There is levied upon and shall be collected from and paid as hereinafter provided by every person on account and for the privilege of engaging in business activities within the City, whether his or her office or place of business is within or without the City, a  business and~~license fee or~~ occupation tax or fee, sometimes herein referred to as the "tax." The tax, except as hereinafter provided, shall be in amounts to be determined by application of rates given against value of products, gross proceeds of sale, or gross income of business as the case may be, ~~for the three calendar months next preceding the beginning of each quarterly period~~ as follows:

 A. Upon every person engaging within the~~this~~ City in business as an extractor; as to such persons the amount of the tax with respect to such business shall be equal to the value of the products extracted for sale or commercial use, multiplied by the rate of two hundred fifteen (215) one-thousandths of one percent (1%). The measure of the tax is the value of the products so extracted, regardless of the place of sale or the fact that deliveries may be made to points outside the City.

 B. Upon every person engaging within the~~this~~ City in business as a manufacturer; as to such persons the amount of the tax with respect to such business shall be equal to the value of the products manufactured, multiplied by the rate of two hundred fifteen (215) one-thousandths of one percent (1%). The measure of the tax is the value of the products so manufactured, regardless of the place of sale or the fact that deliveries may be made to points outside the City.

 C. Upon every person engaging within the~~this~~ City in the business of making sales at wholesale or retail, except persons taxable under subsection D of this section; as to such persons, the amount of tax with respect to such business of making sales at wholesale or retail shall be equal to the gross proceeds of such sales of the business without regard to the place of delivery of articles, commodities or merchandise sold, multiplied by the rate of two hundred fifteen (215) one-thousandths of one percent (1%).

 D. Upon every person engaging within the~~this~~ City in the business of:

1. Buying~~buying~~ wheat, oats, corn, barley and rye, but not including any manufactured or processed products thereof, and selling the same at wholesale, the tax imposed shall be equal to the gross proceeds derived from such sales multiplied by the rate of two hundred fifteen (215) ten-thousandths of one percent (1%); or~~.~~

2. Manufacturing~~Upon every person engaging within this City in the business of manufacturing~~ wheat into flour; the tax imposed shall be equal to the value of the flour manufactured, multiplied by the rate of two hundred fifteen (215) ten-thousandths of one percent (1%).

 E.

 Section 35. Section 5.44.050 of the Seattle Municipal Code (Ordinance 72630, Section 4, as last amended by Ordinance 113611 Section 1(part is renumbered 5.44.410 and further amended to read as follows:

5.44.410~~5.44.050~~ Persons taxable as to each activity - - Principles to reduce multiple taxation.

 A. Persons ~~,~~ who engage in activities that are within the purview of two or more subsections of Section 5.44.400~~5.44.030,~~ shall be taxable under each applicable subsection.

 B. Sections 5.44.412~~5.44.052~~ through 5.44.416~~5.44.056~~ allow a series of exclusions and deductions in order to reduce overlapping gross receipts taxation upon taxpayers engaging in activities within two (2) or more subsections of Section 5.44.400 ~~5.44.030~~ and to follow the precedent of Chapter 3, Laws of 1987, 2nd Ex. Sess. (RCW 82.04.440, as amended). The exclusions and deductions reflect these basic principles:

 1. A taxpayer should pay a gross receipts tax no more than once to a state or national government and once to local government on manufacturing and selling the same product;

 2. The tax should be assessed and collected at the latest stage in the taxpayer's manufacturing/selling process; gross receipts taxes imposed on retailing/wholesaling activity take priority over taxes on manufacturing/extracting activity; and taxes on manufacturing activity take precedence over taxes on~~in~~ extracting activity. Thus, the gross receipts taxes of a jurisdiction with retailing activity (the "market city") apply to displace the gross receipts taxes of the place of manufacturing or wholesaling;

 3. Where wholesaling/retailing activity within subsections C and D(1) of Section 5.44.400~~5.44.030~~ occurs in two (2) or more jurisdictions with gross receipts taxation, Section  5.44.422~~5.44.072~~ applies to allocate transactions; where activity within subsections A, B, D(2), or E of Section 5.44.400 occurs in a contiguous location within two (2) or more jurisdictions,  Section 5.44.420~~5.44.070~~ applies to apportion the taxpayer's gross value of products ~~when extracting/manufacturing activity within subsections A, B or D occurs on a contiguous location within two (2) or more jurisdictions~~;

 4. No deduction is allowed on account of payment of Washington State taxes; payment of dissimilar taxes or fees; liability for taxes on engaging in service activity; or taxes paid by another taxpayer; and

 5. If imposition of the City's tax would place an undue burden upon interstate commerce or violate constitutional requirements, a taxpayer shall be allowed a deduction to the extent necessary to preserve the validity of the City's tax and still apply the City tax to as much of the taxpayer's activities as may be subject to the City's taxing authority (SMC Section 5.44.470(E~~(SMC Section 5.44.110 E)~~.

 C. The term "eligible gross receipts tax" is used in Sections  5.44.412~~5.44.052~~ through 5.44.418~~5.44.058~~ as follows:

 1. The term excludes all taxes imposed by the State of Washington and The City of Seattle;

 2. With respect to political subdivisions of the State of Washington, the term means a business and occupation tax imposed and paid to~~of~~ another Washington city that measures the amount of the payment due by gross receipts and that, in accord with subsection 5.44.410(B)(2)~~B2~~, applies to a later stage in the taxpayer's manufacturing/selling process than the taxpayer's business activity in Seattle;

 3. With respect to the United States of America, its territories and possessions, or a federally recognized Indian tribe with taxing authority; a state other than Washington and political subdivisions of another state; the District of Columbia; or any foreign country or political subdivision thereof, the term means a tax which meets these criteria:

 a. The tax is imposed on the act or privilege of engaging in business activities of making sales at wholesale or retail, manufacturing, or extracting;

 b. The amount of the tax is measured by the gross volume of business, in terms of gross receipts or in other terms, and in ~~the determination of which the deductions allowed would not constitute the tax~~determining what constitutes gross receipts, any deductions allowed against such gross receipts would not result in an income tax or value added tax;

 c. The tax is also not, pursuant to law or custom, separately stated from the sales price; and

 d. The tax is not a sales or use tax, franchise fee, royalty or severance tax measured by volume or weight, or concession charge, or payment for the use and enjoyment of property, property right or a privilege.

D. If it is determined by a court of competent jurisdiction, in a judgement not subject to review, that sections 5.44.412, 5.44.414, and /or 5.44.416 of the Seattle Municipal Code results in an unconstitutional discrimination against interstate or foreign commerce, and that relief is appropriate for any tax reporting periods, it is the intent of the city council that the credit provisions contained in RCW 82.04.440 (1) through (4), and in accordance with SMC 5.44.410 (A) and (C) and SMC 5.44.418, be applied to such reporting periods and that relief for such periods be limited to the granting of such credits. It is further the intent of the city council that such credits shall be applicable only under the conditions provided in RCW 82.04.440 (1) through (4), SMC 5.44.410 (A) and (C), and SMC 5.44.418. The amount of credit shall not exceed the tax liability arising under this chapter in respect to extracting, manufacturing, wholesaling, and retailing. It is the intent of this act to preserve the integrity of Seattle's business and occupation tax system and impose only that financial burden upon the city necessary to establish parity in taxation between taxpayers engaging in business within the city.

 B. Deduction for Activity Taxed Elsewhere. A person taxable under subsection B (engaging in manufacturing) or D(2) (milling wheat) of Section 5.44.400~~5.44.030~~ may deduct from the measure of the tax:

 2. The value of products, which were manufactured in part in Seattle, if manufacturing was completed outside Seattle and the value of the Seattle production was used in measuring an eligible gross receipts tax elsewhere on manufacturing; and/or

 3. The value of products, which were manufactured in Seattle and sold outside Seattle, if the value of such products was used in measuring an eligible gross receipts tax elsewhere on making sales at wholesale or retail.

 C. The amount of any deduction of any transaction shall not exceed the value of the product manufactured in Seattle and reported as subject to tax under subsection B or D(2) of Section 5.44.400.

 Section 38. Section 5.44.056 of the Seattle Municipal Code (Ordinance 72630, Section 4(part), as last amended by Ordinance 113611 Section 1(part is renumbered 5.44.416 and further amended to read as follows:

5.44.416~~5.44.056~~ Multiple activity exclusion from extracting for Seattle-taxed selling and manufacturing -- Deduction for other taxed activity.

 A. Exclusion for Seattle-taxed Activity. A person taxable under subsections A (extracting), B (engaging in manufacturing), or D (milling wheat) of Section 5.44.400 may exclude from the measure of the tax under subsection A (extracting) those amounts the taxpayer used in measuring the tax payable under subsections A or~~,~~ B ~~, or D~~ , respectively, with respect to extracting the ingredients of the products manufactured or sold in Seattle.

Unless the taxpayer proves otherwise, a determination by a court of the State of Washington that such a tax does not qualify for a credit under RCW 82.04.440(5) shall render the amounts of the transactions ineligible for a deduction under such sections.
