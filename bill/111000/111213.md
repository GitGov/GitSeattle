The test or tests of breath shall be administered at the direction of a law enforcement officer having probable cause to believe the person to have been driving or in actual physical control of a motor vehicle within the City while under the influence of intoxicating liquor or in violation of subsection C of this section. However, in those instances where the person is incapable due to physical injury, physical incapacity, or other physical limitation, of providing a breath sample or where the person is being treated in a hospital, clinic, doctor's office, emergency medical vehicle, ambulance, or other similar facility in which a breath testing instrument is not present or where the officer has probable cause to believe that the person is under the influence of a drug, a blood test shall be administered by a qualified person as provided in RCW 46.61.506(4).

 The officer shall inform the person of the person's right to refuse the breath or blood test, and of the person's right to have additional tests administered by any qualified person of the person's choosing as provided elsewhere in this section. The officer shall warn the driver that (i) the driver's license, permit, or privilege to drive will be revoked or denied if the driver refuses to submit to the test, (ii) the driver's license, permit, or privilege to drive will be suspended, revoked, denied, or placed in probationary status if the test is administered and the test indicates the alcohol concentration of the driver's breath or blood is 0.10 or more in the case of a person age twenty-one (21) or over, or 0.02 or more in the case of a person under age twenty-one (21), and (iii) the driver's refusal to take the test may be used in a criminal trial. Except as provided in this section, the test administered shall be of the breath only. If an individual is unconscious or is under arrest for the crime of vehicular homicide as provided in RCW 46.61.520, or vehicular assault as provided in RCW 46.61.522, or if an individual is under arrest for the crime of driving while under the influence of intoxicating liquor or drugs as provided in this section, which arrest results from an accident in which there has been serious bodily injury to another person, a breath or blood test may be administered without the consent of the individual so arrested.

 E. Person Incapable of Refusal.

 Any person who is dead, unconscious, or who is otherwise in a condition rendering the person incapable of refusal, shall be deemed not to have withdrawn the consent provided by subsection C of this section and the test or tests may be administered, subject to the provisions hereof, and the person shall be deemed to have received the warnings required under subsection D of this section.

 F. Refusal to Submit to Test.

 If, following his/her arrest and receipt of warnings under subsection D of this section, the person arrested refuses upon the request of a law enforcement officer to submit to a test of his/her breath or blood, no test shall be given except as authorized under subsection D or E of this section.

 G. Notices to Person After Arrest.

 If, after arrest and after the other applicable conditions and requirements of this section have been satisfied, a test or tests of the person's blood or breath is administered and the test results indicate that the alcohol concentration of the person's breath or blood is 0.10 or more if the person is age twenty-one (21) or over, or 0.02 or more if the person is under the age of twenty-one (21), or the person refuses to submit to a test, the arresting officer or other law enforcement officer at whose direction any test has been given shall give the person the notices and mark the person's Washington state driver's license or permit to drive, if any, as provided by RCW 46.20.308.

 H. Notification of Arrest and Test Result or Refusal to Department of Licensing.

 After giving the notices to the person and marking the person's Washington state driver's license or permit to drive, if any, the law enforcement officer shall, within seventy-two (72) hours, except as delayed as the result of a blood test, transmit to the Washington State Department of Licensing a sworn report or report under a declaration authorized by RCW 9A.72.085 stating: (i) that the officer had probable cause to believe that the arrested person had been driving or was in actual physical control of a motor vehicle within the City while under the influence of intoxicating liquor or drugs, or both, or was under the age of twenty-one (21) years and had been driving or was in actual physical control of a motor vehicle while having an alcohol concentration of 0.02 or more; (ii) that after receipt of the warnings required by subsection D of this section the person refused to submit to a test of the person's breath or blood, or a test was administered and the results indicated that the alcohol concentration of the person's breath or blood was 0.10 or more if the person was age twenty-one (21) or over, or was 0.02 or more if the person was under the age of twenty-one (21); and (iii) any other information that the Director of the Washington State Department of Licensing may require by rule.

 I. Admissibility of Evidence.

 Upon the trial of any civil or criminal action or proceeding arising out of acts alleged to have been committed by any person while driving or in actual physical control of a vehicle while under the influence of intoxicating liquor or any drug, if the person's alcohol concentration is less than 0.10~~0.08~~ it is evidence that may be considered with other competent evidence in determining whether the person was under the influence of intoxicating liquor or any drug. The breath analysis shall be based upon grams of alcohol per two hundred ten (210) liters of breath. The foregoing provisions of this subsection shall not be construed as limiting the introduction of any other competent evidence bearing upon the question whether the person was under the influence of intoxicating liquor or any drug.

 J. Methods of Analysis.

 Analysis of the person's blood or breath to be considered valid under the provisions of this section shall have been performed according to methods approved by the State Toxicologist and by an individual possessing a valid permit issued by the State Toxicologist for this purpose.

 K. Blood Tests.

 When a blood test is administered in accordance with this section, the withdrawal of blood for the purpose of determining its alcoholic or drug content may be performed only by a physician, a registered nurse, or a qualified technician. This limitation shall not apply to the taking of breath specimens.

 L. Right to Additional Tests.

 The person tested may have a physician or a qualified technician, chemist, registered nurse or other qualified person of his or her own choosing administer one (1) or more tests in addition to any administered at the direction of a law enforcement officer. The failure or inability to obtain an additional test by a person shall not preclude the admission of evidence relating to the test or tests taken at the direction of a law enforcement officer.

 M. Right to Information.

 Upon the request of the person who shall submit to a test or tests at the request of a law enforcement officer, full information concerning this test or tests shall be made available to him/her or his/her attorney.

A copy of the report shall be sent to the Washington State Department of Licensing. Based on the diagnostic evaluation, the court shall determine whether the person shall be required to complete a course in an alcohol information school or more intensive treatment.

 8. In addition to any nonsuspendable and nondeferrable jail sentence required by this subsection, whenever the court imposes less than one (1) year in jail, the court shall also suspend but shall not defer a period of confinement for a period not exceeding two (2) years. The court shall impose conditions of probation that include: (i) not driving a motor vehicle within this state without a valid license to drive and proof of financial responsibility for the future; (ii) not driving a motor vehicle within this state while having an alcohol concentration of 0.08 or more within two (2) hours after driving; and (iii) not refusing to submit to a test of his or her breath or blood to determine alcohol concentration upon request of a law enforcement officer who has probable cause to believe the person was driving or was in actual physical control of a motor vehicle within this state while under the influence of intoxicating liquor.
