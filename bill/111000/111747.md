 AN ORDINANCE amending and superseding the Growth-Related Housing Fund Guidelines adopted by Resolution 27332 and amended by Resolution 27687 and 28074, and directing the Department of Housing and Human Services to report back to City Council on a rationale for establishing annual funding levels.

 WHEREAS, Resolution 27332, adopted by the Seattle City Council in 1985, adopted the principle of a Growth-Related Housing Program, which involves dedicating a portion of the City's incremental increase in property tax revenues from downtown new construction to low-income housing; and

 WHEREAS, Resolution 27687 adopted revised Growth-Related Housing Fund Guidelines adopted by Resolution 27332; and

 WHEREAS, Ordinance 113753, passed December 7, 1987, created a Growth- Related Housing Program Org and authorized the Director of Community Development to implement projects consistent with the revised Guidelines; and

 WHEREAS, Ordinance 115889, passed October 14, 1991, made certain changes and clarifications to policies for the Growth-Related Housing Program and other housing programs; and

 WHEREAS, Resolution 28074, adopted September 27, 1989 accepted the principle of using five percent of the tax revenues dedicated to the Growth-Related Housing Program to pay for the costs of administering the program and amended the Guidelines; and

 WHEREAS, City Council adopted a Statement of Legislative Intent during the 1997-1998 budget process that directed the Department of Housing and Human Services ("DHHS") to make recommendations to City Council on revisions to the Growth-Related Housing Program Guidelines, including a basis for funding allocation; and

 WHEREAS, the Department of Housing and Human Services has prepared a report responding to the City Council's Statement of Legislative Intent that includes recommendations on the Growth-Related Housing Program Guidelines; NOW THEREFORE,

 BE IT ORDAINED BY THE CITY OF SEATTLE AS FOLLOWS:

 Section 1. The Growth-Related Housing Program Guidelines shall consist of the following three policies; these policies supersede in their entirety the Growth-Related Program Fund Guidelines that are contained in Attachment A1 to Resolution 27687, as previously modified by Ordinance 115889 and by Resolution 28074:

 1. 1995 Housing Levy

 Growth-Related Housing Program Funds shall be used consistent with the policies for the Rental Housing Production Program, as they apply to households with income less than 50% of median income, for the 1995 Housing Levy, as now in effect or as hereafter adopted, except for the following two policies. In the event of a conflict between the Housing Levy Polices and the two policies set out below, the polices set out below shall control.

 2. Geographic Focus

 At least 75% of the funds appropriated for the Growth-Related Housing Program for any given five-year period must be used in the area bounded by Mercer Street to the north, Broadway, Cherry, 14th and Rainier to the east, and Dearborn Street to the South. Up to 25% of Program funds may be used city-wide. (A map showing these boundaries is attached as Attachment A).

 3. 5% for Administration

 Up to five percent of Growth-Related Housing Program funding may be used by the Department of Housing and Human Services for program administration.

 This Section shall apply to all Growth-Related Housing funds appropriated for budget years 1997 and thereafter. The Director of Housing and Human Services and her designees are authorized to implement projects and to execute, deliver, modify, and administer agreements consistent with the Guidelines in this Section and other applicable laws and ordinances.

 Section 2. DHHS is directed to report to the Health, Housing, Human Services, Education and Libraries Committee on the following two points no later than April, 1998:

 A. Rationale for establishing annual Program funding amounts. The rationale shall be the basis for establishing Program funding levels in the City's 1999-2000 Budget.

 B. Possible changes to Program Guidelines based on experience with welfare reform impacts or on new housing strategies identified through DHHS's 1997 review of low-income housing programs to better meet the needs of people with low income.

 Section 3. Any actions pursuant to the authority and prior to the effective date of this Ordinance are hereby ratified and confirmed.

 Section 4. This ordinance shall take effect and be in force thirty (30) days from and after its approval by the Mayor, but if not approved and returned by the Mayor within ten (10) days after presentation, it shall take effect as provided by Municipal Code Section 1.04.020.
