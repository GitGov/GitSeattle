 AN ORDINANCE authorizing the Mayor to enter into an interlocal agreement with the Port of Seattle relating to the Southwest Harbor Project, fire service, and drainage fee credits, establishing criteria for drainage fee credits for in-kind services of public agencies, authorizing the transfer of drainage and wastewater facilities to the Port, and accepting funds from the Port to aid neighborhood planning.

 WHEREAS, the City of Seattle and the Port of Seattle cooperate to provide important services to the community; and

 WHEREAS, the Port of Seattle's Southwest Harbor Project will enlarge a major marine terminal, providing significant economic and environmental benefits to the region, and necessitating settlement of issues regarding the old West Seattle landfill, improvements to Harbor Avenue Southwest, and the replacement and transfer of certain drainage and wastewater facilities; and

 WHEREAS, the City Council has determined that the drainage and wastewater facilities to be transferred to the Port are surplus to the City's needs; and

 WHEREAS, the City supports the Port's efforts to establish regular cruise ship service in Seattle, and the Port has agreed to help pay for additional fireboat protection if that occurs; and

 WHEREAS, the Port and other public agencies provide water quality services on stormwater runoff from its facilities that may warrant a credit for in-kind services pursuant to RCW 35.67.025 and 35.92.021 on their drainage fees;

 NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT ORDAINED BY THE CITY COUNCIL OF THE CITY OF SEATTLE AS FOLLOWS:

 Section 1. The Mayor is hereby authorized to sign an interlocal agreement with the Port of Seattle, substantially as contained in Attachment A to this resolution, and to take the steps necessary to implement it.

 Section 2. The Mayor is authorized to transfer the City of Seattle drainage and wastewater facilities identified in the agreement to the Port of Seattle in consideration of mutual and offsetting benefits.

 Section 3. The following criteria are hereby established for credit to public agencies for in-kind stormwater pollution prevention or clean-up services pursuant to RCW 35.67.025 and 35.92.021 on their drainage fees:

 The property owner must be a public entity.

 An interlocal agreement between the City and the public entity must spell out the terms and conditions of the credit, including the maximum allowable annual credit, which shall not exceed fifty percent of the drainage fee.

 The credit must be for services that are agreed to in writing by the City.

 The service must provide a water-quality benefit. This could include sediment and habitat improvements or water quality research. The service could include activities or programs or construction of water- quality facilities.

 The service must be provided in an area tributary to a water body where the City has drainage discharges. The intent is to save the City money by reducing contamination in an area that could lead to a City liability.

 The service must reduce the City's costs by doing something that might otherwise be done by the City. Construction of drainage facilities to drain private land are the property owner's responsibility and would not be eligible.

 The service must be for work that is above and beyond that required by current regulations. An example might be the creation of wetlands on a Port development, the creation not required by the Shoreline Management Act. Credit will not be given, for example, for constructing facilities needed to comply with development requirements for new facilities.

 The credit must be for a significant investment. Amounts less than $10,000 will not be considered sufficient to initiate an interlocal agreement.

 Section 4. This ordinance shall take effect and be in force thirty (30) days from and after its approval by the Mayor, but if not approved and returned by the Mayor within ten (10) days after presentation, it shall take effect as provided by Municipal Code Section 1.04.020.

 Passed by the City Council this _____ day of ____________, 19___, and signed by me in open session in authentication of its passage this _____ day of ____________, 19___.
