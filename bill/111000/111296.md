 AN ORDINANCE relating to the Seattle Chinatown-International District Public Development Authority; authorizing the City to provide a guaranty in support of not to exceed Nine Million Dollars ($9,000,000) in tax exempt bonds to be issued by the Authority, establishing the terms and conditions under which the City will provide such guaranty; and authorizing an agreement and such related documents and agreements as are necessary between the City and the Authority with regard to the Authority's issuance of the bonds and the City's guaranty.

 WHEREAS, the Seattle Chinatown International District Public Development Authority (the "Authority") was chartered by the City pursuant to RCW Ch. 35.21 and Chapter 3.110 of the Seattle Municipal Code to "conserve and renew the unique cultural and ethnic integrity characteristic of the International District" in Seattle; and

 WHEREAS, the Authority has formulated plans to develop land in the International District formerly occupied by Metro and currently vacant into a mixed-use facility to be known as the "Village Square" project; and

 WHEREAS, the Village Square project will include low-income assisted elderly housing, a small retail space component, parking facilities, and will provide offices for non-profit social and health service agencies; and

 WHEREAS, the Village Square facility will benefit the International District, and the City of Seattle as a whole, by providing centralized Asian/Pacific resources for health care, mental health and social services, pre-school and childcare, employment and training,, senior advocacy and supportive care and housing; by creating a combined multi-ethnic staffing pool of approximately 225 staff speaking 43 languages; and by allowing the agencies to redirect their resources from administrative costs to service, and provide more services at reduced cost; and

 WHEREAS, the cost to develop the Village Square is approximately Eighteen Million Dollars ($18,000,000), of which the Authority has raised or will raise approximtely Nine Million Dollars ($9,000,000) from sources other than the City-backed bonds, approximately Three Million Dollars ($3,000,000) of which is from private donations; and the Authority has requested that the City facilitate financing the remainder of the development cost by guaranteeing repayment of not to exceed Nine Million Dollars in bonds to be issued by the Authority (the " 1996 Bonds"); and

 WHEREAS, the Authority, on its own, would be unable to obtain financing to develop the Village Square project on terms that would make it economically and financially feasible; and the City's guaranty would significantly reduce the Authority's borrowing costs and thereby enable the Authority to develop the Village Square project in a manner that is financially prudent and that would allow the Authority to provide the greatest benefits to the community in furtherance of its public purpose; and

 WHEREAS, the rental payments from the social and health service agencies and the retail tenant of the Village Square facility, together with other revenues of the Authority, will provide sufficient funds for the repayment of the 1996 Bonds;

 BE IT ORDAINED BY THE CITY OF SEATTLE AS FOLLOWS:

 Section 1. Findings. The City Council hereby makes the following findings:

 It is in the best interests of the City and its citizens for the Authority to build the Village Square project.

 The Authority, on its own, is unable to obtain financing to develop and construct the Village Square project on terms and conditions that make it economically and financially feasible. The pledge by the City of its full faith and credit to guarantee payment of the principal of and interest on the Authority's 1996 Bonds in an amount not to exceed Nine Million Dollars ($9,000,000) will significantly reduce the costs of the Authority's financing for the Village Square project and thereby enable the Authority to meet its debt service requirements. The Authority will derive funds for the repayment of the 1996 Bonds from payments under the leases of portions of the Village Square facility to retail and non-profit social and health service agencies and from other sources available to the Authority.

 The City Council concludes that the most appropriate method of assisting the Authority in furtherance of its public purpose is to pledge its full faith and credit to guarantee payment of the principal of and interest on the 1996 Bonds issued by the Authority. Such guaranty shall be provided in the manner hereinafter set forth in an agreement substantially in the form contained in Exhibit A hereto with such modifications as the Mayor may deem necessary and appropriate and which are consistent with this Ordinance. The City Council hereby further finds and declares that the City's provision of credit support and any expenditure of public funds to assist in the development of the Village Square project are for a public and strictly municipal purpose.

 Section 2. Authorization to execute agreements. If he finds it to be in the best interests of the City to do so, the Mayor is authorized to execute on behalf of the City an agreement with the Authority substantially in the form contained in Exhibit A hereto. The Mayor is further authorized to execute such related agreements and documents as he deems necessary and appropriate to carry out the agreement contemplated in Exhibit A and this Ordinance.

 Section 3. This ordinance shall take effect and be in force thirty (30) days from and after its approval by the Mayor, but if not approved and returned by the Mayor within ten (10) days after presentation, it shall take effect as provided by Municipal Code Section 1.04.020.

 Passed by the City Council the _____ day of ____________, 1996, and signed by me in open session in authentication of its passage this _____ day of _________________, 1996.
