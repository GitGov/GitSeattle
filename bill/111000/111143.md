All expenses associated with Key Tower, including but not limited to operations, asset and property management, tenant improvements, capital improvements, leasing activity, and City management and planning for City occupancy, shall be paid from said subfund, either directly or through reimbursement of other City funds, subfunds, or accounts. The Director of Finance may establish such accounts and subaccounts as he or she deems appropriate from time to time for accounting purposes.

 Section 2. The expenditure allowance in the 1996 Budget for the Department of Administrative Services is hereby increased by the conditional appropriation of Fifteen Million Two Hundred Thousand Dollars ($15,200,000), or as much thereof as may be necessary, from unexpended and unencumbered balances in the City Hall Subfund of the General Fund that have been derived from rents and other revenues attributable to Key Tower. No part of this appropriation may be encumbered or expended except under the condition that there is sufficient unencumbered balance of such rents and revenues in the City Hall Subfund at the time the encumbrance or expenditure is about to be made. This appropriation is solely for paying expenses associated with Key Tower. Any part of this appropriation remaining unexpended and unencumbered at the end of 1996 shall carry forward from year to year until fully expended.

 Section 3. The foregoing appropriation is made to meet actual necessary expenditures of the City for which insufficient appropriations have been made due to causes which could not reasonably have been foreseen at the time of the adoption of the 1996 Budget.

The Consultants shall not be the City's exclusive broker for any leases negotiated with tenants during the term of this contract. Any leases for tenants shall be reviewed and approved by the Mayor and the City Council Finance and Budget Committee based on criteria including but not limited to the following: 1) the ability to generate minimum revenue requirements 2) the ability to meet appropriate space available that will not hamper the City's ability to meet its scheduled move-in, and 3) the ability to retain or attract jobs deemed important to meet the City's economic development goals.
