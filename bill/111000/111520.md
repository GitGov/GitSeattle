 AN ORDINANCE relating to the City Employees' Retirement System, establishing a temporary cost of living bonus for 1997, and making payment of that bonus an obligation of the Retirement System.

 WHEREAS, the City of Seattle recognizes that over an extended period of time inflation can erode the purchasing power of pensions earned by retired employees; and

 WHEREAS, the City of Seattle desires to provide to its retired employees or their beneficiaries a one-time bonus in 1997 to bring their annual City of Seattle retirement income to 40 percent of its original worth at the time of the employees' retirement;

 BE IT ORDAINED BY THE CITY OF SEATTLE AS FOLLOWS:

 Section 1. A. During calendar year 1997, it shall be an obligation of the Retirement System to pay a temporary cost of living bonus as follows:

 1. The temporary cost of living bonus shall apply only to those City retirees, and any of their designated beneficiaries, receiving City of Seattle retirement income, whose annual City of Seattle retirement income has fallen below 40 percent of the original worth at the time of the employee's retirement. The Retirement Board staff shall (1) identify the retirees and beneficiaries who quality for the temporary cost of living bonus; (2) calculate the appropriate bonus amount required to bring the individual benefit amount up to 40 percent of the original value; and (3) distribute the temporary cost of living bonus to the affected individuals by the end of June, 1997.

 2. The appropriate inflation measure shall be the change in the Seattle Consumer Price Index for Urban Wage Earners and Clerical Workers (CPI-W) from the time of retirement to the end of 1996, as reported by the Bureau of Labor Statistics in mid-February, 1997.

 3. The temporary cost of living bonus shall be payable half from the city moneys expressly appropriated for this purpose in the 1997 budgets of Finance General, the Light Fund, the Water Fund, the Solid Waste Fund, and the Drainage/Wastewater Fund, and half from moneys available for this purpose in the Retirement Fund.

 B. The temporary cost of living bonus shall not be deemed part of the "Annual Pension Allowance" as that term is used in Section 4.36.155 of the Seattle Municipal Code, and is not subject to inclusion in calculation of the bonus dividend provided in that section.

 C. The temporary cost of living bonus shall expire at the end of 1997, and no active member, retired member, or beneficiary shall have any right or claim to a cost of living bonus after December 31, 1997, by virtue of this ordinance.

 Section 2. This ordinance shall take effect and be in force thirty (30) days from and after its approval by the Mayor, but if not approved and returned by the Mayor within ten (10) days after presentation, it shall take effect as provided by Municipal Code Section 1.04.020.
