 AN ORDINANCE relating to utility cuts and other openings in City streets, alleys, and other public places for construction or other activities; amending Chapter 15.26 Backfilling and Chapter 15.32 Franchise and Public Utility Permits and Regulations of the Seattle Municipal Code.

 WHEREAS, the City of Seattle, Washington (the "City"), possesses a transportation system that is vital to the economic vitality of the City and the enhancement of the City's quality of life and is an important public function; and

 WHEREAS, a substantial portion of the City's transportation funds go to repairing and rehabilitating the City's streets; and

 WHEREAS, the City wishes to preserve the investment in its transportation system; and

 WHEREAS, utilities, including telecommunication carriers, provide essential services to City residents and businesses, and the rights- of-way are critical to the ability of utilities to provide such services, and

 WHEREAS, the City authorizes public and private utilities to work in City streets and rights-of-way to operate and maintain utility services, within the limitations established by State and Federal Law; and

 WHEREAS, the work of these utilities can seriously impact the condition and useful life of the City's streets; and

 WHEREAS, even when restoration standards are met, it is not always reasonably feasible to restore the paved surface to its condition prior to being cut, and some loss of useful life may occur for some types of surfaces; and

 WHEREAS, construction in the street rights-of-way can represent an inconvenience and disruption to commerce and the public and citizens may become frustrated with repeated tearing up of City streets; and

 WHEREAS, the City Council, with the Mayor concurring, passed Resolution 29587 stating the City's intent to review utility cut permit fees and rates paid by public and private utilities to determine if such fees and rates cover the full costs of restoring the street to its original condition and reflect any loss of, or reduction in, the useful life of the street; and

 WHEREAS, the aforementioned Resolution directed the Executive to review and propose a policy that would require the street area around utility cuts to be restored to its original condition as quickly and efficiently as possible; NOW, THEREFORE,

 BE IT ORDAINED BY THE CITY OF SEATTLE AS FOLLOWS:

 Section 1. Chapter 15.26 of the Seattle Municipal Code, entitled Backfilling, is amended to add a new section as follows:

 15.26.030 Quality of backfill material

 The authorizing official shall require the permit holder to use a select backfill material approved by the Director of Transportation that achieves a level of subgrade support for all temporary and permanent street restorations that prevents settling of the base in relation to the surrounding street area.

 Section 15.32.050 of the Seattle Municipal Code is amended as follows:

 15.32.050 Coordination of Projects and Deferment of Construction

A. The authorizing official may, in such official's reasonable discretion, defer construction or other activity under any permit provided for in this chapter, until such time as such official deems proper in all cases where the public place on which the work is desired to be done is occupied or about to be occupied in any work by the City, or by some other person having a right to use the same in such manner as to render it seriously inconvenient to the public to permit any further obstruction thereof at such time, and in granting such permit, may so regulate the manner of doing such work in order to cause the least inconvenience to the public in the use of such public place; and in all cases any work of the City or its contractors or employees for municipal purposes shall have precedence over all work of every other kind.

B. Beginning by November 1, 1997, and by October 1 of each succeeding year, the Director of Transportation shall provide to all utilities a list of street and other improvements planned for the following three (3) years. All agencies, utilities, franchisees, and City departments planning work in a street, alley, or other public place that will require a permit under this chapter shall submit a list of proposed projects and locations to the Director of Transportation by December 31 of each year. This list shall cover planned projects for the following three (3) years. These lists of planned projects shall be entered into the City's Geographic Information System and integrated with other information on street condition and use. The Director of Transportation and the Superintendent of Parks and Recreation shall deny agencies that fail to provide this information permits for construction or other activity under this chapter unless that agency was not timely provided a list of planned street improvements for that year.

C. The Director of Transportation shall establish a Utility Coordinating Committee for the purpose of coordinating street and utility projects to minimize the frequency of street openings and disruption to neighborhoods. This committee shall consist of one (1) management representative each from Seattle Transportation, Seattle Public Utilities, and Seattle City Light. The Director of Transportation shall invite one representative each from companies that applied in the previous calendar year for a permit under this chapter to serve in an advisory capacity to this committee. The committee shall meet at least twice a year to review and coordinate street and utility projects for the next three (3) years. The committee shall decide which of the submitted projects will be scheduled for the next twelve (12) months, taking into consideration maximizing efficiencies, reducing inconvenience to the public, and avoiding work conflicts in the street rights-of-way; and shall not allow pavement cuts within three (3) years after resurfacing or reconstruction. By March 1, 1998, and by February 1 of each succeeding year, the committee shall develop and publish a Street and Utility Improvement Plan that lists projects it has scheduled for the next twelve (12) months and shall make information available to affected residents, property owners, neighborhood organizations, and businesses about these projects. The committee shall also annually review and comment on the City's Pavement Opening Policies and associated fees, charges, inspection costs, and street restoration costs. The Director of Transportation shall propose to the City Council legislation to establish fees and charges by ordinance.

D. Except for activities included in the current Street and Utility Improvement Plan, no permit shall be issued under this chapter for construction or other activity that will commence in the street, alley, or other public place; except, that this prohibition shall not apply to:  1. emergency repairs that could not have been anticipated or are necessary for the protection of the public's health and safety;

 2. new or revised service connections that have been requested by a utility's customer;

 3. construction or other activity that will commence in the street, alley, or other public place that does not affect or conflict with other projects in the Street and Utility Improvement Plan or other work anticipated by the City or other permit holders over the next three (3) years;

 4. or work for which the City's denial of a permit would violate federal law.

E. No permit shall be issued under this chapter for work that requires cutting or disturbing the paved surface of any street, alley, or other public place for a period of three (3) years from the completion of resurfacing or reconstruction of that public place; except that this prohibition shall not apply to:  1. emergency repairs that could not have been anticipated and are necessary for the protection of the public's health and safety;

 2. new or revised service connections that have been requested by a utility's customer; or

 3. work for which the City's denial of a permit would violate federal law.

F. An applicant denied a permit under the provisions of this section may appeal to the Director of Transportation, whose decision in such matter shall be final.

Section 3. A new section is added to Chapter 15.32 of the Seattle Municipal Code, entitled Franchise and Public Utility Permits and Regulations, as follows:

 15.32.160 Street restoration requirements.

 A. Anyone issued a permit for construction or other activity under this chapter shall temporarily restore the street, alley, or other public place in a manner approved by the Director of Transportation, or as to park drives and boulevards, the Superintendent of Parks and Recreation, within twenty-four (24) hours after completion of the work for which the permit was issued. This requirement of a temporary restoration shall be waived if a permanent restoration is completed in a manner approved by the Director of Transportation as described in subsections C, D, and E of this section within twenty-four (24) hours after completion of the work for which the permit was issued.

 B. All permanent repairs of a temporary restoration shall be completed within one (1) year after completion of the work for which the permit was issued. If the permittee fails to complete the permanent restoration within this time period and in a manner approved by the Director of Transportation as described in subsections C, D, and E of this section, the Director of Transportation, or as to park drives and boulevards, the Superintendent of Parks and Recreation, may restore the street, alley, or other public place and bill the permittee for the repair as set forth in section 15.26.020. The permittee may, at the time the permit is issued, if the Director of Transportation agrees, contract with the Director of Transportation for completion of the permanent restoration.

 C. Permanent restoration of a concrete street, alley, or other public place shall be completed in a manner approved by the Director of Transportation. Permanent restoration shall include, at a minimum, the following, unless the Director of Transportation determines that the permittee can otherwise make an equivalent restoration of the street, alley, or other public:

 For any concrete surface fifteen (15) years old or less or in excellent condition as determined by the Director of Transportation, entire replacement of any concrete panel affected by the construction or other activity is required, except that in the case of a large concrete panel, the Director of Transportation may authorize the panel to be saw cut and require only the affected portion of the panel be replaced.

 For any concrete surface where forty percent (40%) or more of a concrete panel is affected by the construction or other activity, entire replacement of any concrete panel so affected by the construction or other activity is required, except that in the case of a large concrete panel, the Director of Transportation may authorize the panel to be saw cut and require only the affected portion of the panel be replaced.

 For any other concrete surface, restoration of the area of the panel affected is required.

 D. Permanent restoration of an asphalt or asphalt overlay street, alley or other public place shall be completed in a manner acceptable to the Director of Transportation. Permanent restoration shall include, at a minimum, the following, unless the Director of Transportation determines that the permittee can otherwise make an equivalent restoration of the street, alley, or other public place:

 For any asphalt surface three (3) years old or less, new asphalt for the length of the cut and width of all lanes affected by the construction or other activity is required.

 For any asphalt surface where thirty percent (30%) or more of the width of any lane is affected by the construction or other activity, new asphalt for the length of the cut and width of all lanes affected is required.

 For any other asphalt surface, new asphalt for the length and width of the affected area is required.

 E. Permittees shall be responsible for any necessary repair of a temporary restoration of a street, alley, or other public place until the permanent restoration is completed. Permittees shall be responsible for any necessary repair of a permanent restoration until the street, alley, or other public place has exceeded its useful life or has been repaved or reconstructed; unless the permittee contracted with the Director of Transportation for the permanent restoration. If the permittee who is responsible fails to complete any necessary repair of a failed temporary restoration within three (3) calendar days or a permanent restoration within thirty (30) calendar days of being notified to do so by the City, the Director of Transportation may complete the repair and bill the permittee for the costs of such repair as set forth in section 15.26.020.

 F. In those cases where the Director of Transportation, or as to park drives and boulevards, the Superintendent of Parks and Recreation, has determined that the permittee has not restored the street, alley, or other public place to its condition prior to the commencement of activity under the permit, the permittee shall pay to the Director of Transportation, or as to park drives and boulevards, the Superintendent of Parks and Recreation, a standard charge from a schedule adopted by ordinance reflecting the Director of Transportation's estimate of the loss in useful life of the street, alley, or other public place as a result of the construction or other activity. Such charge shall be based on the size of the area affected and the types of surface (concrete, asphalt, or other) and subgrade material of the street, alley, or other public place prior to the commencement of activity under the permit. This charge shall be paid regardless of whether the permanent street restoration is completed by the permittee or by the Director of Transportation. All funds collected from this charge shall be deposited in the Transportation Fund, or as to park drives and boulevards, the Parks and Recreation Fund, and used only for pavement replacement, repair, and maintenance, and not for any other purpose.

Section 4. To implement the provisions of this ordinance, the Director of Transportation shall adopt such rules and regulations as he or she deems necessary. Initial rules and regulations should be adopted no later than December 1, 1997.

Section 5. Severability. The several provisions of this ordinance are declared to be separate and severable and the invalidity of any clause, sentence, paragraph, subdivision, section, subsection, or portion of this ordinance, or the invalidity of the application thereof to any person, property, or circumstance, shall not affect the validity of the remainder of this ordinance or the validity of its application to other persons, property, or circumstances

 Section 6. This ordinance shall take effect and be in force thirty (30) days from and after its approval by the Mayor, but if not approved and returned by the Mayor within ten (10) days after presentation, it shall take effect as provided by Municipal Code Section 1.04.020.
