 AN ORDINANCE relating to the Ethics and Elections Commission; providing for closed hearings on Ethics Code charges upon request of certain City employees, but providing for charges and decisions to be made public if a violation is found; authorizing and making provisions for appeals to Seattle Municipal Court of certain fines imposed by the Commission for violation of the Code of Ethics; making technical corrections; and amending sections 4.16.030, 4.16.090, and 4.16.100 of the Seattle Municipal Code in connection therewith.

 BE IT ORDAINED BY THE CITY OF SEATTLE AS FOLLOWS:

 Section . Subsections C and E of Section 4.16.030 of the Seattle Municipal Code are amended as follows:

 4.16.030 Definitions

 As used in this chapter, the following terms shall have the meanings indicated.

 ***

 C. "Board of Ethics" or "Board" or "Commission" means the Seattle Ethics and Elections Commission established by Section 3.70.010.

 ***

 E. "City officer or employee" means every individual elected or appointed to an office or position of employment in any City agency, whether such individual is paid or unpaid. For purposes of subsections 4.16.090G and 4.16.100B only, "City employee" also includes every individual who was a City employee at the time of the act or omission that is alleged to have violated this chapter, even though he or she is not a City employee at the time of the hearing or appeal provided under those subsections.

 Section . A new subsection H is added to Section 4.16.030 of the Seattle Municipal Code as follows:

 H. "Executive Director" means the Executive Director of the Seattle Ethics and Elections Commission.

 Section . Section 4.16.090 of the Seattle Municipal Code is amended as follows:

 4.16.090 Complaints, investigations, hearings, and enforcement.

 In addition to the powers of the Commission and its Executive Director under SMC Sections 3.70.100 and 3.70.160 to initiate an investigation, an investigation may also be initiated by filing a complaint.

 A. Any person may file a complaint alleging a violation of this chapter. If such complaint is filed by a member of the ~~Board of Ethics~~Commission, he or she is then disqualified from participating in any proceedings that may arise from the complaint.

 B. The complaint shall be in writing and shall be signed by the complainant. The written complaint shall state the nature of the alleged violation(s), the date(s), time and place of each occurrence, and name of the person(s) alleged to have violated this chapter. The complaint shall be filed with the ~~Administrator~~Executive Director. The complainant shall provide the ~~Administrator~~Executive Director with all available documentation or other evidence to demonstrate a reason for believing that a violation has occurred.

 C. Within thirty (30) days after receipt of a complaint, the ~~Administrator~~Executive Director shall conduct a preliminary investigation to determine whether a complaint, on its face, alleges facts that, if true, would constitute a violation of Chapter 4.16. At the request of the ~~Administrator~~ Executive Director, the ~~Board~~Commission may, for good cause shown, extend the time for completion of the preliminary investigation. If the ~~Board~~Commission determines that the preliminary investigation must be completed in less than thirty (30) days in order to avoid prejudice or irreparable harm to the person alleged to have violated this chapter, the ~~Board~~Commission shall order the ~~Administrator~~Executive Director to complete the preliminary investigation in a shorter period of time, and the ~~Administrator~~Executive Director  shall comply.

 D. If the ~~Administrator~~Executive Director determines, after investigation, that there are no reasonable grounds to believe that a violation has occurred, or determines that the violation was inadvertent and minor, the ~~Administrator~~ Executive Director shall dismiss the complaint. If the ~~Administrator~~Executive Director does so dismiss the complaint, he or she shall do so in writing, setting forth the facts and the provisions of law upon which the dismissal is based, and shall provide a copy of the written dismissal to the complainant, to the person named in the complaint as the alleged violator and to the ~~Board~~Commission.

 E. If, after investigation, the ~~Administrator~~ Executive Director has reason to believe that a material violation of Chapter 4.16 has occurred, the ~~Administrator~~Executive Director shall initiate an enforcement proceeding by issuing to the alleged violator a charging document which includes the provisions of Chapter 4.16 allegedly violated and the conduct that constitutes the violation(s), and shall issue a copy of the charging document to the ~~Board~~Commission and schedule a hearing before the ~~Board~~Commission. No hearing shall be scheduled, however, while an ~~Administrator~~Executive Director's recommendation for a settlement is awaiting action by the ~~Board~~Commission.

 F. The ~~Board~~Commission shall commence a hearing within thirty (30) days from the date that the ~~Administrator~~Executive Director schedules the hearing. The ~~Board~~Commission shall issue a written determination stating whether the chapter has been violated and setting forth the facts and the provisions of law upon which this determination is based. A copy of said determination shall be delivered to the complainant, if any, to the person charged with the violation and, where appropriate, to the person's superior.

 G. All hearings hereunder shall be conducted as "contested case" hearings under the Administrative Code, Seattle Municipal Code Chapter

 3.02 (Ordinance 102228) and the ~~Board~~Commission's rules and regulations. All hearings under this section shall be open to the public unless closed upon the request of the City employee who is the subject of the charges being heard, except that all hearings on charges against (1) City officials elected by the public, (2) the deputy mayor, if any, (3) heads of departments and executive department offices, (4) members of boards and commissions, and (5) those City employees who are represented by a labor union that, on the date the charges were filed, had not reached written agreement with the City concerning closing hearings on request, shall be open to the public. Regardless of whether the hearing was closed, if the Commission determines this chapter was violated, the charges, all recordings or transcripts of hearings that were made by the Commission, and the Commission's written findings of fact and conclusions of law shall be made public.

 H. If the ~~Board~~Commission determines that a City officer or employee has violated the provisions of this chapter, the ~~Board~~Commission may recommend that the officer or employee be subject to disciplinary action. In addition to any other penalty herein or otherwise provided by law, a violation shall be cause for suspension, discharge, or removal from office, or such other disciplinary action as may, by the appropriate City authority, be deemed necessary and proper, and consistent with personnel ordinances and rules. A written report of the disciplinary action taken as a result of the ~~Board~~Commission recommendation shall be made by the appropriate City authority to the ~~Board~~ Commission within fourteen (14) calendar days after receipt of the ~~Board~~Commission's recommendation; provided, that this section shall not derogate from employee rights under any collective bargaining agreement or City personnel ordinance, or rules promulgated thereunto. If the appropriate City authority determines that the written report of disciplinary action taken as a result of the ~~Board~~Commission recommendation required in the section cannot be made to the ~~Board~~Commission within fourteen (14) calendar days after receipt of the ~~Board~~Commission 's recommendation, because of procedures prescribed under any collective bargaining agreement, personnel ordinance, or rule promulgated thereunto, the appropriate City authority shall so report to the ~~Board~~Commission within fourteen (14) calendar days after receipt of the ~~Board~~Commission 's recommendation, stating the date on which the written report of disciplinary action taken will be submitted to the ~~Board~~ Commission. If the violation involves prohibited conduct of a former officer or employee, the ~~Board~~Commission may recommend to the administering City authority that no contract be made or that the contract be terminated and that proceedings be begun anew in order to prevent injury to the City or to avoid an unfair advantage accruing to a competitor by reason of the violation. Upon receipt of the written report of the disciplinary action taken, or in the event no report is received, the ~~Board~~Commission shall review such matter and make such further recommendation as may be appropriate.

 Section . Section 4.16.100 of the Seattle Municipal Code is amended as follows:

 4.16.100 Penalty for violation, appeals of fines imposed by Commission. A. Violation of any provision of Section 4.16.070 or 4.16.080 of this chapter constitutes an infraction for which a monetary fine, not to exceed Five Hundred Dollars ($500.00) may be assessed. Violation may be proven by a preponderance of evidence, and need not be proven beyond a reasonable doubt.

B. 1. Except as provided in subsection C of this section, if the Commission imposes a monetary fine for violation of any provision of this chapter, the City employee on whom the fine is imposed may appeal the fine, on the Commission's record, to the Seattle Municipal Court. The Seattle Municipal Court shall uphold the Commission's decision if it determines the Commission's decision was not for any arbitrary, capricious, or illegal reason, and the decision was supported by substantial evidence in the Commission's record. Otherwise, the Court shall modify, reverse, or remand the matter to the Commission, as the Court deems appropriate.

2. In order to appeal a monetary fine imposed under this chapter by the Seattle Ethics and Elections Commission, the City employee on whom the fine is imposed must file a notice of appeal with the Clerk of the Municipal Court, serve it upon the City of Seattle, and deliver a copy to the Executive Director of the Commission, all within twenty (20) days after the date of the Commission's decision. In order to file the notice of appeal, the City employee must pay to the Clerk of the Municipal Court a filing fee in the amount set by statute or court rule for a civil action filed in the District Courts.  The filing fee and the costs of preparing the record of the proceedings of the Commission may be taxed as costs against the non- prevailing party, as the Municipal Court may direct, but each party shall bear its own attorney's fees. The notice of appeal shall be in writing and shall include the mailing address and, if different, the street address where papers may be served on the appellant. The notice of appeal shall contain, in separate numbered paragraphs, statements of the specific findings of fact, conclusions of law, or aspects of the fine on which the appellant seeks review, the basis for the appeal, and a brief statement of the relief requested. The appellant shall attach a copy of the written decision of the Commission being appealed.

3. Within thirty (30) days after the notice of appeal has been properly filed, served, and a copy delivered to the Executive Director, the appellant shall provide the Executive Director with a record of proceedings, which the Executive Director shall, if it complies with this subsection, promptly file with the Municipal Court so as to present the issues raised for review. Upon payment of the costs of copying, the Executive Director shall provide the appellant a copy of the relevant papers and exhibits, which shall be included in the record. The record shall also include a transcript of those portions of the testimony that are designated by the appellant or by the Executive Director, who shall each designate what they believe necessary to resolve disputed issues. The appellant at his or her expense shall submit to the Executive Director for review and approval, if accurate, the transcript of the designated portions of the testimony, prepared by a certified court reporter. The typed transcript, when certified as accurate by the Executive Director, shall constitute the record for review of the portion so transcribed. If all or a designated part of a tape recording is not audible, the Executive Director may prepare and certify a summary of that portion of the testimony in the proceedings based on his or her notes and memory. Where the Executive Director and the appellant agree that the testimony or facts are not in dispute, they may jointly prepare a narrative report of some or all of the evidence or a summary of some or all of the testimony in order to reduce the amount of material transcribed and to make a more compact record.

4. Except where inconsistent with this section, the procedural rules of the Civil Rules for Courts of Limited Jurisdiction (CRLJs), as they may be amended from time to time, shall govern procedure related to the appeal in the Municipal Court, but no new evidence may be submitted to or taken by the Municipal Court.

5. The Municipal Court shall appoint a judge pro tempore to hear appeals by employees of the Municipal Court unless both the City employee and the Executive Director agree that a regular Municipal Court judge may hear the case.

C. Subsection B of this section shall not apply to (1) City officials elected by the public, (2) the deputy mayor, if any, (3) heads of departments and executive department offices, (4) members of boards and commissions, and (5) those City employees who are represented by a labor union that, on the date the charges were filed had not reached written agreement with the City regarding the appeal to Municipal Court of monetary fines imposed by the Commission. Persons for whom an appeal to Seattle Municipal Court is not authorized by this section may seek review of a monetary fine imposed by the Commission in King County Superior Court as provided in state law.

 Section . This ordinance shall take effect and be in force thirty (30) days from and after its approval by the Mayor, but if not approved and returned by the Mayor within ten (10) days after presentation, it shall take effect as provided by Municipal Code Section 1.04.020.
