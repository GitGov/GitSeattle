 WHEREAS, The City of Seattle issued $35,000,000 in Limited Tax General Obligation Bonds (Capital Facilities Projects), 1992 under Ordinance 116105 (the "1992 Bonds"), secured by a pledge of Real Estate Excise Tax revenues; and

 WHEREAS, Ordinance 116105 specified that bond proceeds are to be used for certain capital purposes including housing projects, parks and recreational facilities, open space and health facilities; and

 WHEREAS, Ordinance 117340 amended Ordinance 116105 in order to clarify that concert hall facilities were eligible for funding with proceeds of the 1992 Bonds; and

 WHEREAS, Ordinance 117100 appropriated a portion of the remaining proceeds of the 1992 Bonds for housing projects and other purposes, including low-income housing and a community clinic as part of the International District Village Square ("IDVS") Project, housing projects to be selected in the South Lake Union area and P-Patches; and

 WHEREAS, Ordinance 117341 decreased the appropriation of proceeds of the 1992 Bonds for housing projects, including reductions in Bond proceeds for the IDVS and for projects in the South Lake Union area, in view of the availability of general fund revenues appropriated for such projects in the same Ordinance; and

 WHEREAS, Ordinance 118162 authorized the issuance of up to $26,000,000 in limited tax general obligation bonds (the "1996 Bonds") to pay a portion of the costs of the downtown concert hall, to provide funds for low-income housing, and for other lawful City purposes as determined by ordinance; and

 WHEREAS, Ordinances 117352, 117814 and 117898 authorized the expenditure of proceeds of the 1992 Bonds for costs related to the downtown concert hall, and as a result there are insufficient funds remaining from the proceeds of the 1992 Bonds to support the appropriations made in Ordinance 117100, as amended by Ordinance 117341, for low-income housing; and

 WHEREAS, the Director of Housing and Human Services has determined that certain general fund revenues appropriated in Ordinance 117341 are required for other projects, and has therefore recommended that a portion of the 1996 Bond proceeds be devoted to the IDVS and that a portion of the 1996 Bond proceeds also be made available for housing in the South Lake Union area; Now, Therefore,
