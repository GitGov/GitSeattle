 All permanent employees of the City with the exception of elected officials and department heads, are eligible for receipt of an award: provided that no employee who is or has been subject to disciplinary action for engaging in an act of harassment and/or discrimination which is prohibited by federal, state, or local laws, or who fails to fulfill a responsibility to report incidents of harassment and/or discrimination to an appropriate City manager or Human Resources employee is eligible for consideration for receipt of an award.

 Section 2. Seattle Municipal Code section 4.92.010 (Ordinance 86927, as amended), is further amended as follows:

 4.92.010 Criteria for submission of suggestions.

 The City continues a program of awards adopted by Ordinance 79944, as amended, to reward suggestions of City employees that are of benefit to the City. Participation therein shall be limited to those employees who submit such suggestions in accordance with the following regulations:

 A. To be eligible for a money award a suggestion must make possible an extension of public service commensurate with the expense involved or an elimination or reduction of City expenditures without substantially impairing such service, or provide a desirable safety factor. Suggestions submitted to a departmental program, but for which the suggesters did not receive money awards, may be submitted for consideration by the Suggestion Award Board. Suggestions that have received a money reward from another City award program are not eligible.

 B. Exclusion. Elected officials, heads of employing units, and managers who report directly to a head of employing unit, or employees whose job involves the identification of improvement in the operations of the City are not eligible for an award under the program. Employees shall not be eligible for an award for suggestions pertaining to subjects assigned to them for research and/or development or as a result of problems assigned for solution, either as part of their regular duties or as a special assignment.  Provided further, no employee shall be eligible for such an award who is or has been subject to disciplinary action for engaging in harassment and/or discrimination prohibited by federal, state or local law, or who has failed to fulfill a responsibility to report incidents of harassment and/or discrimination to an appropriate City manager or Human Resources employee.

 C. The suggestion must propose a change which was not under active consideration by the City agency affected at the time the suggestion was made.

 D. If duplicate suggestions are submitted, only the first received shall be eligible for an award.

 E. A suggestion which has been put into effect by the City agency concerned must be submitted for award consideration within ninety (90) days of its adoption; provided that this requirement may be waived by the City Council upon recommendation of the Suggestion Award Board.

 F. Each suggester shall execute the following agreement: "In consideration of my participation in the Suggestion Award Program I hereby agree that the use by The City of Seattle of my suggestion concerning . . . shall not be the basis of a claim of any nature against The City of Seattle by me, my heirs, executors or assigns."

 G. Appropriate commendation of an employee whose adopted suggestion does not merit a cash award may be recommended by the Board.

 H. Insofar as may be equitable and practicable the total amount of a money award shall be approximately ten percent (10%) of the estimated value to the City of the suggestion during the first year following its adoption. If the foregoing formula in the judgment of the Suggestion Award Board does not suitably measure the merits of a suggestion, the Board shall determine the amount it deems equitable and recommend same to the City Council.
