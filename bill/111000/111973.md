 AN ORDINANCE related to public works contracts; creating a new Seattle Municipal Code Chapter 20.38 to establish a permanent apprenticeship training program for City funded public works contracts; and extending a position for the administration thereof.

 WHEREAS, the City of Seattle is committed to provide regional leadership in the area of economic development; and

 WHEREAS, the City of Seattle is committed to working in partnership with labor, business and the community to create a skilled workforce that reflects the diversity of our city's population; and

 WHEREAS, a well trained diverse workforce is critical to the economic and social vitality of the region; and

 WHEREAS, businesses report serious difficulties finding new workers with adequate basic and technical skills; and

 WHEREAS, demographic trends indicate that the new entrants to the labor force will be comprised of women, people of color and immigrants who have historically faced barriers to employment and have been underrepresented in the skilled trades; and

 WHEREAS, the City's public works contracts will provide training and job opportunities as a means to increase the skills of the workforce; and

 WHEREAS, the City is committed to using training that is accepted industry-wide so that the resulting journey workers can enter the region's pool of skilled labor, fully qualified for the jobs throughout the industry; and

 WHEREAS, the City's apprenticeship pilot program successfully demonstrated the use of apprentice labor and the creation of new training opportunities; and

 WHEREAS, open-shop contractors have expressed concern that access to state-approved training programs is exclusive to union participation; and

 WHEREAS, in accordance with WAC 296-04, state-approved training programs are required to be accessible to all employers without requiring that they enter into a collective bargaining agreement; and

 WHEREAS, the Washington State Apprenticeship and Training Council (SAC) has approved training programs in the construction industry which are primarily sponsored by a group of employers and labor organizations; and

 WHEREAS, the state-approved programs are primarily operated by joint apprenticeship and training committees which are composed of equal representation by management and labor organizations; and

 WHEREAS, in accordance with federal and state regulations, six different types of apprenticeship training program sponsorship may be approved, including "group joint" (sponsored by management and a labor organization) and "group non-joint" (sponsored by management, without a labor organization); and

 WHEREAS, the City recognizes the interest of all contractors and employees to choose an apprenticeship program that meets their needs; and

 WHEREAS, the City is committed to promoting apprenticeship opportunities on public works projects and ensuring that all contractors participate in this requirement; Now, therefore
