It is essential that new or additional development on steep slopes and other landslide-prone areas not take place until this assessment is completed and the City determines whether existing regulations are adequate to protect the public health, safety, and welfare.

 B. Work that is necessary to stabilize a site that has been rendered unstable by recent slide activity, so as to lessen the risk of new or additional damage;

 C. Work that is necessary to repair damaged structures or utilities, as long as the Director is reasonably satisfied that the work will not increase the risk of either short-term or long-term damage to the site or neighboring property;

 D. Work that would be exempted pursuant to Section 25.09.040, provided that work that would be exempted pursuant to Subsections B, C, and F may be approved only if the Director is reasonably satisfied that the work will not increase the risk of either short-term or long- term damage to the site or neighboring property; and
