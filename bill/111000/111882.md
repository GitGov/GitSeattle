 AN ORDINANCE relating to low-income housing, amending the 1996-98 Administrative and Financial Plan for the 1995 Housing Levy Programs administered by the Department of Housing and Human Services adopted in Ordinance 118258; clarifying the allocation of 1997 Budget authority among Housing Levy programs; authorizing related transfers; and ratifying and confirming prior acts.

 WHEREAS, pursuant to Ordinance 117711, as amended, the voters of The City of Seattle approved the levy of property taxes for the purpose of financing low-income housing, including housing for very low-income households under RCW 84.52.105, and established allocations of revenues to certain programs; and

 WHEREAS, Ordinance 117711 and the Affordable Housing Financing Plan attached thereto provide for periodic submission to the City Council of an Administrative and Financial Plan for programs funded by the 1995 Housing Levy ("Levy Programs"); and

 WHEREAS, in Ordinance 118258 the City Council approved the 1996-98 Administrative and Financial Plan for the 1995 Housing Levy (the "A & F Plan"); and

 WHEREAS, in the 1997 Adopted Budget the revenues from the Housing Levy for 1996-97 were appropriated in a lump sum; and

 WHEREAS, Ordinance 117711 provides that the City Council shall direct the transfer of moneys to the 1995 Levy Operating and Maintenance Trust Fund at such times and in such amounts as it determines to be appropriate to implement the Affordable Housing Financing Plan; and

 WHEREAS, on October 14, 1997 the Housing Levy Oversight Committee voted to recommend that the City Council approve the amendments to the 1996-98 Administrative and Financial Plan as proposed by the Department of Housing and Human Services and further amended by the Housing Levy Oversight Committee; Now, Therefore,

 BE IT ORDAINED BY THE CITY OF SEATTLE AS FOLLOWS:

 Section 1. The City Council amends the approved 1995 Seattle Housing Levy Administrative and Financial Plan for Program Years 1996- 98 by substituting Exhibit A to this Ordinance, including Program Funding Plan text, Table 1 and Table 2, for the "Appropriation Plan" and Table 1 of the A & F Plan. Table 1 of Exhibit A shows the Program Funding Plan and Table 2 shows the Property Tax Distribution by Program. Consistent with Ordinance 117711, the amount of 1995 Housing Levy funds appropriated in the 1997 Adopted Budget shall be allocated among the Levy Programs so that the 1997 budget authority for each Levy Program is equal to the total of the 1996 and 1997 amounts for such program in Table 2. All 1997 appropriations for Levy Programs shall carry forward from year to year unless expressly abandoned by ordinance. All transfers necessary to implement the intent of this Section are hereby authorized, including two transfers from the 1995 Low-Income Housing Levy Subfund (Subfund 11) of the Low-Income Housing Fund to the 1995 Levy Operating and Maintenance Subfund of that Fund, as follows: (1) effective as of December 31, 1996, the amount of ONE MILLION FOUR HUNDRED THIRTY-SEVEN THOUSAND THREE HUNDRED SEVENTY-THREE AND 45/100 DOLLARS ($1,437,373.45), which includes both tax revenues appropriated for the Operating and Maintenance Trust Fund program out of receipts for the year then ended and earnings then accrued in Subfund 11; and (2) effective as of December 31, 1997, an amount equal to ONE MILLION TWO HUNDRED FIFTY THOUSAND ONE HUNDRED FORTY- THREE AND NO/100 DOLLARS ($1,250,143.00) plus the total amount of earnings on amounts in Subfund 11 in 1997, less a prorated portion (14.78%) of any amount by which the annual revenues authorized for the Housing Levy in 1997 shall have exceeded actual tax collections for the Housing Levy for such year. The estimated amount of the December 31, 1997 transfer is ONE MILLION FIVE HUNDRED FIFTY THOUSAND ONE HUNDRED FORTY THREE AND NO/100 DOLLARS ($1,550,143.00).

 Section 2. Any actions pursuant to the authority granted by this Ordinance and prior to the effective date hereof are hereby ratified and confirmed.

 Section 3. This ordinance shall take effect and be in force thirty (30) days from and after its approval by the Mayor, but if not approved and returned by the Mayor within ten (10) days after presentation, it shall take effect as provided by Municipal Code Section 1.04.020.
