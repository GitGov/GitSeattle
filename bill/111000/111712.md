 EXHIBIT B

 The City of Seattle has two home buyer assistance programs funded in part with federal HOME funds: Downpayment Assistance Program (DAP), and Community Land Trusts (CLT).

 A) The Downpayment Assistance Program will require a promissory note and deed of trust for each unit purchased with DAP funds to ensure recapture of the HOME funded subsidy upon resale, refinance, or change of use or ownership of the property, or if the housing does not continue to be the principal residence of the family. Recapture funds will be placed in a revolving loan fund to finance additional first time home purchase by income eligible households.

 B) The Community Land Trust Program will require:

 1) Initial sale and resale of subsidized units to low-income households, defined for HOME purposes as households with incomes at or below 80% of the PMSA median household income, as adjusted for household size;

 2) The resale price during the applicable affordability period will be limited based on the purchase price increased in proportion to the increase in median income, with further adjustments for capital improvements and/or depreciation if deemed appropriate to ensure a fair return to the homeowner consistent with continued affordability.
