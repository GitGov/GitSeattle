 WHEREAS, Ordinance 84390, adopted October, 1955, established the Director of Engineering's authority to charge for wastewater services has been amended and revised thirty-nine (39) times since it was first adopted and contains references to customers and services that no longer exist; and

 WHEREAS, these amendments to Chapter 21.28 were done over a long time in a manner that made the chapter confusing and difficult to follow; and

 WHEREAS, to lower their wastewater bills, more customers are installing submeters to measure water that does not enter the sewer system, and the City wishes to clarify the roles and responsibilities of those customers; Now, Therefore,

 BE IT ORDAINED BY THE CITY OF SEATTLE AS FOLLOWS:

 Section 1. Chapter 21.28 of the Seattle Municipal Code is recaptioned to read as follows:

 SMC Chapter 21.28 ~~SEWER~~WASTEWATER RATES AND CHARGES and all references to subchapters are hereby eliminated.

 Section 2. Chapter 21.28 of the Seattle Municipal Code is amended to read as follows: ~~Severability: If any part or portion of Subchapter I shall be held unconstitutional or otherwise invalid, such decision shall not affect the validity of the remaining portions thereof.~~~~~~~~If any provision of Sections 21.28.090 through 21.28.190 and 21.28.210 through 21.28.240 or its application to any person, industry or circumstance is held invalid, the remainder of said sections or the application of the provision to other persons, industries or circumstances shall not be affected.~~

 21.28.010 Sewerage system a public utility.

 It is necessary for the public health, safety and welfare that the existing sewerage system of the City, in conjunction with the storm and surface water sewers, together with such

 extensions, additions and ~~betterments~~improvements thereto as may from time to time be authorized, continue to be maintained, conducted and operated as a public utility of the City called the Drainage and Wastewater Utility~~beginning October 1, 1955~~. The Drainage and Wastewater Utility shall have jurisdiction over those properties, interests, and physical and intangible rights of every kind and nature owned or held by the City within its boundaries which comprise or relate to storm and surface water sewers, including all facilities constructed and to be constructed with moneys from the Drainage and Wastewater Fund, formerly the Sewer Improvement Fund, but excepting such properties, interests and rights under the jurisdiction of the Parks and Recreation Department, the Seattle Center Department, the Water Department, the City Light Department and the Department of Administrative Services. Nothing contained in this chapter is intended to be nor shall be construed to create or form the basis for any liability on the part of the City, or its officers, employees or agents, for any injury or damage resulting from or by reason of any act or omission in connection with the implementation or enforcement of this chapter on the part of the City by its officers, employees or agents. 21.28.020 Administration of utility. The Director of Engineering, through the Department of Engineering, shall operate and administer ~~such public utility~~the Drainage and Wastewater Utility and enforce this ~~subchapter;~~chapter and there shall be kept a classified system of accounts of revenues and disbursements as prescribed by the State Auditor, Division of Municipal Corporations, in conjunction with the City Finance Director, as required by law. 21.28.030 Rates and charges-Purpose.

 The public health, safety, and welfare require that the City fix and collect ~~sewerage~~wastewater rates and charges measured by water consumption and impose the same upon premises in the City for the carrying and discharge of all ~~sewage~~ wastewater and drainage into the municipal sewerage system of the City as presently maintained and operated, together with additions and ~~betterments~~improvements thereto and extensions thereof, and for the payment of charges of ~~Municipality of Metropolitan Seattle~~King County  Department of Natural Resources

 (herein called ~~"Metro"~~"King County" and formerly Municipality of Metropolitan Seattle ("Metro" and of Southwest Suburban Sewer District (herein called "Southwest Suburban") for ~~sewage~~ wastewater interception, treatment, and disposal, which sewerage utility rates and charges are fixed in the Seattle Municipal Code; provided that the local improvement district method of providing for the construction of sewers and trunk sewers to serve abutting property shall be continued in the manner provided by law.

 21.28.040 ~~Sewer customer service charge and Volume Rate- Exceptions.~~Wastewater volume charge.

 A. There is hereby imposed ~~as of January 1, 1982~~ upon all premises served by the ~~Sewerage~~Drainage and Wastewater Utility and on which water is consumed a ~~City sewer customer service charge, which is a uniform charge per customer to cover billing and general administrative costs, and a Volume Rate, which is a uniform rate per one hundred (100) cubic feet or any portion thereof, of metered flow to cover treatment costs, and all other operating, maintenance, and capital costs, to enable the City to perform sewerage operations and its contractual obligations with Metro and Southwest Suburban; provided that the following premises shall be exempt from the Sewer Customer Service Charge and Volume Rate imposed by this subchapter:~~volume charge for wastewater services. The volume charge shall be the amount obtained when the wastewater volume rate is multiplied by the volume of water consumed on the premises, whatever the source of such water. Wastewater shall be metered water consumption. However, every premise shall pay at the minimum a wastewater volume volume charge equal to one (1) CCF (hundred cubic feet) per month to cover billing and general administrative costs. The following premises shall be exempt from the charge imposed by this section:

 1. Premises which are not connected and not required under SMC 21.16.040 (Section 3 of Ordinance 97016) to be connected to the public sewer system;

 2. Premises, the owner, agent, lessee, or occupant of which has not been notified in accordance with SMC 21.16.040 (Section 4 of Ordinance 97016) to connect to the public sewer system.

B. There is hereby imposed upon all premises served by the Drainage and Wastewater Utility and on which water is consumed, a City wastewater volume rate per CCF of metered flow per month. The minimum monthly wastewater volume charge shall be equal to the wastewater volume rate for one CCF regardless of actual metered flow. Effective January 1, 1996, the 1995 wastewater volume rate shall be increased only in the amount necessary to pass-through the cost to the Drainage and Wastewater Utility of the increase, if any, in the King County wastewater treatment rate for 1996; provided that such King County increase shall not increase the Drainage and Wastewater Utility's wastewater volume rate to more than Four Dollars and Twenty-three Cents ($4.23) per CCF, and the actual rate has been determined by the Drainage and Wastewater Utility to be Four Dollars and Five Cents ($4.05) per CCF.~~21.28.060 Determination of Volume Rate.~~~~~~~~The Volume Rate shall be based on the water consumed on the premises, whatever the source of such water, and the same shall be metered either by a public utility meter or one installed and maintained by the owner of the premises at his own expense and approved by the Director of Engineering. Where two (2) or more single-family residences, including houseboats, are served by the same water meter the water consumed by each residence shall be determined by dividing the total water consumed by the number of residences. Where single-family residences are served through the same meter as premises other than a single-family residence, the charge for each such residence shall be based on the water consumed for each such residence served through the same meter. Motel units, including any business office, which are served by one (1) water meter shall constitute only one (1) premises. Water meter readings shall not be combined, and where two (2) or more main water meters serve the same premises, sewerage charges shall be computed and billed as though each such meter served separate premises; provided, that in the event a sewage meter is installed on any premises, the charge shall be based on the consumption registered by such sewage meter.~~~~~~~~21.28.070 Exemptions and adjustments to charges.~~

~~A. Where the use of water is such that a portion of all water used is lost by evaporation, irrigation, sprinkling or other cause, or is used in manufactured goods and commodities, and either (1) the person in control provides proof thereof and installs a meter or measuring device approved by the Director of Engineering to enable measurement of the amount of water so used or lost, or (2) an evaporation loss allowance is established by ordinance which specifies the percentage of all water used that is lost by evaporation, no charge shall be made for wastewater because of water so used or lost. Except for premises exempted from the Wastewater Customer Service Charge and/or the Volume Rate imposed in Section 21.28.040 of the Seattle Municipal Code (Section 4 of Ordinance 84390, as last amended by Ordinance 109504), direct discharge of sewage or industrial waste to salt or fresh water or to points other than the City sewer system shall not be cause for adjustment or reduction of the sewage charge or rate. Evaporation loss allowances of eleven percent (11%) for industrial laundries and three percent (3%) for laundromats are established. B. Water metered exclusively for fire service, sprinkling, irrigation or delivery of water to ships shall not be subject to any wastewater charge or rate. C. Upon receipt of satisfactory evidence of hidden or underground water leakage, the Director of Engineering shall adjust the Volume Rate to the premises for water so lost and shall not use the period during which such leakage occurs in computing the winter or minimum average water consumption when to do so would result in a higher wastewater charge to such premises, provided that no such adjustment shall be made for leakage occurring more than four (4) months prior to the date of application therefor.~~

 21.28.080 ~~Charges based on average consumption-Exemptions.~~Calculation of residential wastewater volume charge.

 A. It is the intent of this ~~subsection~~section~~not to~~~~charge single-family and duplex residences for that~~to calculate residential wastewater charges based on water that should enter the sewerage system, and not on water used exclusively for irrigation or sprinkling. Wastewater ~~bills~~charges for single-family and duplex residences shall be calculated in the following manner: For the six (6) months from November 1st through April 30th, the wastewater ~~bill~~charge shall be based on metered water consumption. For the six (6) months from May 1st through October 31st, the wastewater ~~bill~~charge shall be based on average winter water consumption or metered water consumption, whichever is less. Average winter water consumption shall be calculated using the first four (4) month billing period that falls between November 1st and April 30th. ~~Single-family residences and duplex units which have insufficient water consumption history to calculate average winter water consumption shall be charged an assumed volume of six hundred (600) cubic feet per month or metered water consumption, whichever is less. Single-family residences and duplex units not served by a publicly owned water supply system which have no previous record of water consumption shall be charged an assumed volume of six hundred (600) cubic feet per month of water consumption. If the Director of Engineering believes that previous~~records are more representative of expected usage in the first year, he or she may use previous records of water consumption in lieu of the assumed volume of six hundred (600) cubic feet if the new owners or occupants have established water consumption records at a prior single-family or duplex residence in the City wastewater service area.

 The following is an example of residential billing:

~~B. It is the intent of this subsection that that portion of water used exclusively for irrigation or sprinkling by premises other than single-family or duplex residences not be charged correspondingly for wastewater. Where it is impractical to install a meter or measuring device as described in subsection A of Section 21.28.070 customers may apply to the Director of Engineering by May 1st of each year for an adjustment to the volume rate,~~provided that the ratepayer provides proof of the amount of water so used or lost.

~~C. It is the intent of this subsection that public and private schools which have lower enrollment and staff during major portions of the months of June, July and August, but increased water usage due to irrigation and sprinkling, not be charged correspondingly for wastewater. Where it is impractical to install a meter or measuring device as described in subsection A of Section 21.28.070 such schools may apply to the Director of Engineering by May 1st of each year for an adjustment to the volume rate, provided that the ratepayer~~provides proof of the amount of water so used or lost. D. Where wastewater service is provided to premises outside the City limits, the wastewater charge shall be computed on the same basis as premises located inside the City, except that a sum equal to thirty percent (30%) of the wastewater charge shall be added, with the exception of sewer districts, or portions thereof, outside the City limits which are now or may hereafter be covered by special agreements.

~~~~B. The Director of Engineering may use an assumed volume of six CCF per household, or prior water consumption records if those records are more representative of expected usage, to calculate residential wastewater charges under the following circumstances;  When the water meter has been determined to be malfunctioning;

 When customers have insufficient water consumption history to calculate average winter water consumption;

 When water use in the period used to calculate average winter water consumption is not representative of expected water use, such as rental property that is vacant between tenants or in the case of seasonal customers; and

 4. When customers are not served by a publicly owned water supply system.

 21.28.200 Wastes which would damage or overburden system.

 A. In cases where the character of ~~sewage~~wastewater  or industrial wastes from any manufacturing or industrial plant, building or premises is such that it will damage the sewerage system, or cannot be treated satisfactorily, the Director of Engineering shall require such users to dispose of such waste and prevent it from entering the system.

 B. In cases where the character of the ~~sewage~~ industrial waste from any manufacturing or industrial plant, building or premises is such that it imposes an unreasonable burden upon ~~said~~the sewerage system greater than that imposed by the average ~~sewage~~wastewater entering the system, the Director of Engineering may by rule, require such manufacturing or industrial plant, building or premises, to pretreat such ~~sewage~~wastewater by means satisfactory to the Director of Engineering before discharging such ~~sewage~~wastewater into the sewerage system of the City. C. If such pretreatment is not accomplished, the Director of Engineering shall recommend

 to the Council the levying of a surcharge which shall be in addition to the regular charge. The Council thereupon, by ordinance, may fix the amount of the surcharge.

 21.28.220 ~~Director of Engineering's authority to bill HSIW charges.~~High Strength Industrial Wastewater (HSIW) charges.

~~Effective January 1, 1977, t~~A.The Director of Engineering is assigned the responsibility for billing and collecting for and on behalf of ~~Metro~~King County, ~~Metro's~~King County's High Strength Industrial Waste (HSIW) charges upon industrial users within the City's jurisdiction who deposit high-strength industrial wastes in the ~~Metropolitan~~King County sewerage system, said charges to be determined by ~~Metro~~King County pursuant to Metro Resolution 2557 ~~utilizing information supplied by the Director of Engineering according to Section 21.28.230 of the Seattle Municipal Code (Section 5.3 of Ordinance 84390, as added by Ordinance 101162);~~ provided, however, that the Director of Engineering shall not bill such charges to users until the amounts thereof have been certified to him or her by ~~Metro~~King County. B. The Director of Engineering shall provide King County each quarter with a listing of the water consumption by or metered flow to each HSIW industry served by the City. C. In addition to the high-strength industrial waste charges as computed and certified to him or her by King County, the Director of Engineering shall add thereto in each instance a sum equal to the City and state taxes against such charges, if any, and a sum equal to the user's proportional share of the administration, billing and collection costs as determined by the Director of Engineering, and in connection with such billing the Director of Engineering  may include on the same statement but as a separate item the High Strength Industrial Waste charges to be collected by the City for/ and on behalf of King County

. ~~21.28.230 List of water consumption of HSIW industries.~~~~~~~~The Director of Engineering shall provide Metro each quarter with a listing of the water consumption by or metered flow to each HSIW industry served by the City, as requested by Section 10 of Metro Resolution 2577.~~~~~~~~SMC 21.28.240 Additional charges.~~~~~~~~In addition to the high-strength industrial waste charges as computed and certified to him~~by Metro, the Director of Engineering shall add thereto in each instance a sum equal to the City and state taxes against such charges, if any, and a sum equal to the user's proportional share of the administration, billing and collection costs as determined by the Director of Engineering, and in connection with such billing the Director of Engineering may include on the same statement but as a separate item the High Strength Industrial Waste charges to be collected by the City for and on behalf of Metro.

 21.28.090 Calculation of commercial wastewater volume charge.

 A. It is the intent of this section to charge commercial customers for water that should enter the sewer system. Wastewater charges shall be based on the metered water delivered to the premises except as noted below:

 Water metered exclusively for fire service, sprinkling, irrigation or delivery of water to ships shall not be subject to any wastewater charge or rate.

 Where the use of water is such that a portion of all water used is lost by evaporation, irrigation, sprinkling or other cause, or is used in manufactured goods and commodities, customers may install, at their own expense, submeters approved by the Director of Engineering to enable measurement of the amount of water so used or lost. These submeters must measure in CCF, must be calibrated on a regular basis, and must be easily accessible for meter reading. If the submeter is unable to be read or if the reading is unreliable, an estimate can be used, but the Drainage and Wastewater Utility must get at least one (1) accurate meter reading per year. It will be the responsibility of the Drainage and Wastewater Utility or its designee to inspect and approve the installation of a new submeter.

 Where it is impractical to install a meter as described above, customers may apply to the Director of Engineering for an evaporation allowance or an irrigation allowance, provided that customer provide proof of the amount of water so used or lost. Evaporation loss allowances of eleven percent (11%) for industrial laundries and three percent (3%) for laundromats are established. Irrigation allowances shall apply from June 1st through September 30th and will be calculated based on the residential methodology in Section 21.30.80.

 B. Direct discharge of wastewater or industrial waste to salt or fresh water or to points other than the City sewer system shall not be cause for adjustment or reduction of the wastewater charge or rate.

 21.28.100 Adjustments to wastewater volume charge.

 A. Upon receipt of satisfactory evidence of hidden or underground water leakage, the Director of Engineering shall adjust the wastewater volume charge to the premises for water so lost and shall not use the period during which such leakage occurs in computing the average winter water consumption when to do so would result in a higher wastewater charge to such premises, provided that no such adjustment shall be made for leakage occurring more than four (4) months prior to the date of application therefor.

 B. Where wastewater service is provided to premises outside the City limits, the wastewater charge shall be computed on the same basis as premises located inside the City, except that a sum equal to thirty percent (30%) of the wastewater charge shall be added, with the exception of sewer districts, or portions thereof, outside the City limits which are now or may hereafter be covered by special agreements. C. Where wastewater service is provided to qualified low-income customers as defined in Section 21.76 of the Seattle Municipal Code, wastewater charges shall be partially offset in accordance with that chapter.

 21.28.400 Severability.

The provisions of this chapter are declared to be separate and severable. The invalidity of any clause, sentence, paragraph, section or portion of this chapter shall not affect the validity of the remaining portions thereof. If its application to any person, industry or circumstance is held invalid, the remainder of said sections or the application of the provision to other persons, industries or circumstances shall not be affected.

 Section 4. This ordinance shall take effect and be in force thirty (30) days from and after its approval by the Mayor, but if not approved and returned by the Mayor within ten (10) days after presentation, it shall take effect as provided by Municipal Code Section 1.04.020.
