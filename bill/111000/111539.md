The Mayor or his designee is further authorized, on behalf of the City, to execute, deliver, perform and administer a Contract for Loan Guarantee Assistance with HUD (the "Contract") in the form attached as Exhibit B-1 with such additions, modifications and amendments as HUD may require or the Mayor deem necessary or advisable to carry out the purposes of this Ordinance.

The Contract (including any Replacement Contract) shall state that the notes issued by the City pursuant to Section 2 of this Ordinance shall be non-recourse notes, that the City's liability on the Notes and the Contract shall be limited solely to the security pledged therefor, that they are not obligations of the City or the State of Washington, that neither the Notes nor the Contract shall constitute a debt payable from the City's public funds, and that neither the faith and credit nor the taxing power of the City shall be pledged for the City's obligations under the Contract or for payment of principal, interest or premium, if any, on the Notes.

 Section 2. The Mayor or his designee is authorized, on behalf of The City of Seattle, to issue non-recourse promissory notes ("Notes") in the aggregate principal amount of not to exceed Six Million Eight Hundred and Sixty Thousand Dollars ($6,860,000) in the form attached as Exhibit C-1, with such modifications, additions or amendments as HUD may require or the Mayor or his designee may deem necessary or advisable to carry out the purposes of this Ordinance. The interest rates for the Notes shall be as determined in accordance with the terms of the Notes and Contract. The Notes shall have maturities approximately as stated on the attached Exhibit D, with such modifications and amendments as HUD may require or the Mayor deem necessary or advisable to carry out the purposes of this Ordinance. Notes may provide for optional redemption on or after such date as may be specified by HUD. The Mayor or his designee is further authorized, on behalf of the City, to cause the proceeds of the Notes to be disbursed by the financial institution acting as Custodian pursuant to Section 4 of this Ordinance to the order of Health Science Properties, Inc., a Maryland corporation, or any substitute entity approved by the Mayor or his designee ("HSP"), pursuant to the Loan Agreement authorized in Section 3 of this Ordinance, to partially finance the acquisition of the current Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center buildings. The Mayor or his designee is further authorized, on behalf of The City of Seattle, at the request of HUD, to execute and deliver one or more replacement non-recourse promissory notes ("Replacement Note") in the aggregate principal amount of not to exceed Six Million Eight Hundred and Sixty Thousand Dollars ($6,860,000) in the form attached as Exhibit C-2, with such modifications, additions or amendments as HUD may require or the Mayor or his designee may deem necessary or advisable to carry out the purposes of this Ordinance. Pursuant to RCW 35.21.735, the Notes (including any Replacement Note) shall contain a recital to the effect that they are not obligations of the City or the State of Washington, and that neither the faith and credit nor the taxing power of the state, the City or any other municipal corporation or subdivision of the state or any agency of any of the foregoing is pledged to the payment of principal, interest or premium if any, thereon.

 Section 3. The Mayor or his designee is authorized, on behalf of The City of Seattle, to execute, deliver, administer and cause to be performed a Loan Agreement with HSP, in the form attached as Exhibit E, with such additions, modifications, and amendments as HUD may require or the Mayor may deem necessary or advisable to carry out the purposes of this Ordinance, together with such ancillary and related documents as the Mayor may deem necessary or advisable to carry out the purposes of this Ordinance. Such modifications may include, without limitation, agreement by the City to eliminate any difference between the interest rate payable by HSP and the interest rate payable on the Notes, if HSP agrees to pay a periodic monitoring fee or similar fee over the life of the Loan Agreement. The loan shall be secured by security that is satisfactory to HUD and the Director of the Office of Economic Development ("OED Director"), which shall include a second lien position deed of trust on the property on which the current Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center buildings are located, and such other security as the Mayor or his designee deem necessary or advisable to carry out the purposes of this Ordinance.

 Section 4. The Mayor or his designee is authorized, on behalf of the City, to negotiate and execute one or more agreements with a financial institution to act as trustee and/or custodian (the "Custodian") to receive and disburse the proceeds of the City's non- recourse Notes and to receive, administer and expend such funds as are received from HSP as repayments or other payments under the Loan Agreement or from realization on the security for the loan. Such agreement shall include establishment by the Custodian of one or more special funds or accounts from which the City's Notes shall be repaid, and any other funds or accounts that HUD may require or the Mayor or his designee may deem necessary or appropriate.

The agreement(s) with the Custodian and all funds or accounts established thereunder shall comply with RCW 35.21.735. The Mayor or his designee is further authorized to negotiate and execute such additional agreements as the Mayor deems necessary or advisable to carry out the purposes of this Ordinance and to implement the Section 108 loan guaranty.

The authority granted in this Section shall apply notwithstanding Seattle Municipal Code subsection 5.10.060A, to the extent it might be deemed applicable to the Notes.

 Section 5. The Mayor or his designee may require HSP to pay a loan origination fee of no more than SIXTY-EIGHT THOUSAND SIX HUNDRED DOLLARS ($ 68,600). Such fee shall be paid directly to the Custodian to be held in trust for the purposes set forth in this Section. The OED Director is authorized to cause all or a portion of this fee to be disbursed by the Custodian to pay the National Development Council for consulting services related to this loan in accordance with the City's existing contract with National Development Council, and to pay for the City's legal fees and other costs related to the issuance and placement of the Notes and the administration of the transactions authorized by this Ordinance, that are not paid by HSP pursuant to the Loan Agreement. The OED Director is authorized to cause (i) any remaining portion of such fee, and (ii) any payments received by the Custodian representing the difference between the interest rates charged to HSP and the lower rates applicable to the Notes, or representing a periodic monitoring fee or similar fee in lieu of such difference in rates, to be applied to payment of expenses incurred in the administration of any federally guaranteed or federally funded economic development loan or program administered by the OED Director or to be remitted to the City and deposited in the Housing and Community Development Revenue Sharing Fund.

 Section 6. The Director of the Department of Housing and Human Services is authorized to amend the City's 1996 Consolidated Plan to reflect the transactions contemplated by this Ordinance. The Mayor, OED Director, and Director of Housing and Human Services are authorized to take such other actions as they shall deem necessary to implement the actions authorized by this Ordinance.

 Section 7. This Ordinance is not intended to create, and shall not be construed to create, any contractual or otherwise binding obligation upon, or commitment by, the City for the benefit of HSP or any other party interested in the purchase, sale, or redevelopment of the current Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center buildings. The commitment to HSP authorized by this ordinance, subject to the limitations herein and under applicable law, shall become effective only if and when the agreements authorized hereby are duly executed and delivered by the City and other necessary parties.

 Section 8. Any act pursuant to the authority and prior to the effective date of this ordinance is hereby ratified and confirmed.

 Section 9. This ordinance shall take effect and be in force thirty (30) days from and after its approval by the Mayor, but if not approved and returned by the Mayor within ten (10) days after presentation, it shall take effect as provided by Municipal Code Section 1.04.020.
