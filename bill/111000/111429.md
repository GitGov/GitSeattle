 AN ORDINANCE relating to the Seattle Center Department; adding a project element to the Seattle Center 2000 Plan - Phase I; transferring appropriation allowances among certain Seattle Center Redevelopment projects funded in part by the proceeds of a special property tax levy approved by the voters in May 1991; all upon a three-fourths vote of the City Council.

 WHEREAS, the Seattle City Council on July 25, 1990, by Resolution 28210, adopted the Seattle Center 2000 Master Plan and by Ordinance 115593 on March 25, 1991, approved the Seattle Center 2000 Plan - Phase I; and

 WHEREAS, the citizens of Seattle on May 28, 1991, by approving a special property tax levy, provided for certain improvements at Seattle Center pursuant to the Seattle Center 2000 Plan - Phase I; and

 WHEREAS, to reflect changed conditions, the Seattle City Council has amended the Seattle Center 2000 Plan - Phase I by Ordinances 115844, 116179, 116457, 116848, 117275, 117545, 117889, and 118078; and

 WHEREAS, the Seattle Center Department has recommended and the Seattle Center Advisory Commission has approved additional changes to the Seattle Center 2000 Plan - Phase I to reflect changed conditions; Now, Therefore,

 BE IT ORDAINED BY THE CITY OF SEATTLE AS FOLLOWS:

 Section 1. Findings. The City Council makes the following findings:

 a. The Seattle Center 2000 Master Plan, adopted by the City Council in July 1990, provided the foundation for the 1991 City and County Seattle Center levies.

 b. Many changes have occurred since the adoption of the Seattle Center 2000 Master Plan, including the following: the failure of the 1991 County levy, the decision to locate the Concert Hall downtown rather than at Seattle Center, redevelopment of the Coliseum into the KeyArena, construction of the Children's Museum in Center House, and the decision to renovate rather than demolish the Flag Pavilion.

 c. A number of new redevelopment projects are being planned for Seattle Center, including: a new IMAX Theatre and education area at the Pacific Science Center, the Experience Music Project, redevelopment of the Fun Forest in approximately its current location, Space Needle access and parking improvements, and the development of additional parking on the Bus Barn site.

 d. The Seattle Center 2000 Master Plan needs to be updated to reflect the changes that have occurred since it was adopted and to guide future development at Seattle Center.

 e. The scopes of work of the South Mall Plaza project, as previously revised by the City Council, and the Pacific Arts Center/Children's Theatre Court project, both project elements of the Seattle Center 2000 Plan - Phase I, have been completed and the remaining balances in these projects are available for other elements in the Seattle Center 2000 Plan - Phase I.

 f. To carry out the update of the Seattle Center 2000 Master Plan, a new project element entitled Seattle Center Master Plan Update should be added to the Seattle Center 2000 Plan - Phase I, and this project element should be funded from the remaining balances in the South Mall Plaza and Pacific Arts Center/Children's Theatre Court projects.

 g. Ordinance 115844 established the Seattle Center Advisory Commission as the official citizen Oversight Committee for the Seattle Center Levy and the implementation of the Seattle Center 2000 Plan - Phase I. At its August 1, 1996 meeting, the Seattle Center Advisory Commission voted to approve of the following actions: (1) to create a new project element in the Seattle Center 2000 Plan - Phase I entitled Seattle Center Master Plan Update, and (2) to transfer the remaining balances in the South Mall Plaza and Pacific Arts Center/Children's Theatre Court projects to the Seattle Center Master Plan Update project.

 h. The Seattle Center and the City Council's Parks, Public Grounds, and Recreation Committee have reviewed the requested changes in Seattle Center levy-funded project budgets according to the Project Modification Criteria set forth in the Seattle Center Redevelopment Cooperation Agreement authorized by Ordinance 115593 and have found the proposed changes to be consistent with the Seattle Center 2000 Master Plan and the purposes of the Seattle Center Levy program, and to warrant the 1996 budget changes specified below:

 1. South Mall Plaza (S9139) - Reduce $89,134; Revised Budget - $84,966.

 2. Pacific Arts Center/Children's Theatre Court (S9114) - Reduce $151,104; Revised Budget - $355,796.

 3. Seattle Center Master Plan Update (S9610) - Increase $240,238; Revised Budget - $240,238.
