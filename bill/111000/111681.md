 WHEREAS, the City of Seattle has established the Environmental Management Initiative to work towards ensuring that the City of Seattle, as a corporate entity, incorporates the highest level of environmental stewardship in its business practices; and

 WHEREAS, that same Resolution directed the Executive to develop a strategy for funding longer-term conservation planning; and

 WHEREAS, investing in energy and water conservation measures in City facilities is, over time, expected to yield significant cost savings to the City, in most cases repaying the initial capital investment within ten years through reduced utility bills; and

 WHEREAS, with Mayor and Council approval, City staff conducted a competitive process to contract with performance-based Energy Services Companies that will, with guaranteed savings, help the City conserve energy and water as well as reduce operating costs of City facilities;

 WHEREAS, it is the City's intent that an accounting and tracking system be developed to ensure the repayment of the initial capital investment within ten years through reduced utility bills to the extent practicable;
