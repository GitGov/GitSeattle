 AN ORDINANCE relating to the City Light Department, authorizing an easement agreement with the State of Washington Department of Transportation (the "State") for use of the City of Seattle Skagit Transmission Line Right of Way in Skagit County, Washington, for a right of way for State Highway SR 530 (P.M. #341019-3-302).

 WHEREAS, by deed dated January 29, 1952, recorded under Skagit County Auditor's File No. 471584, the City of Seattle acquired fee simple title to a strip of land 450 feet wide in Government Lot 5, Section 19, Township 34 North, Range 10 East, W.M., in Skagit County, Washington for a transmission line right of way; and,

 WHEREAS, by deed dated October 10, 1955, recorded under Skagit County Auditor's File No. 525562, Skagit County purported to acquire fee simple title to a strip of land for a County road 80 feet wide through said Government Lot 5 and over and across the City's 450 foot wide right of way; and,

 WHEREAS, said 80 foot wide strip of land was subsequently acquired by the State for the State Highway SR 530 right of way, and has been used for a number of years and is currently being used for a right of way for State Highway SR 530; and,

 WHEREAS, because the deed to Skagit County was invalid with respect to the portion of Government Lot 5 owned by the City, the State acquired no interest in the City's land, and the State has, therefore, requested that the City grant the State an easement for said 80 foot strip of land over and across the City's right of way; and,

 WHEREAS, the City Light Department has determined that the grant of an easement to the State for an 80 foot wide right of way for State Highway SR 530, subject to certain terms and conditions, will not interfere with, or be a hazard to the City's construction, operation and maintenance of the Skagit Transmission System; Now, Therefore,

 BE IT ORDAINED BY THE CITY OF SEATTLE AS FOLLOWS:

 FIVE HUNDRED DOLLARS ($1,500.00) to be deposited in the Light

 Transportation for a right of way for State Highway SR 530 and for all State highway purposes over, upon, under and across the following described property in Skagit County, Washington:
