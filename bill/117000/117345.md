 ORDINANCE _________________

 AN ORDINANCE relating to the City of Seattle's solid waste system, regulating the distribution of single-use plastic and biodegradable carryout bags and requiring retail establishments to collect a pass-through charge from customers requesting recyclable paper carryout bags, and amending Seattle Municipal Code Chapter 21.36.

 WHEREAS, the Washington State Legislature in RCW 70.95.010(8)(a) established waste reduction as the first priority for the collection, handling, and management of solid waste; and

 WHEREAS, the Washington State Legislature in RCW 70.95.010(4) found that it is "necessary to change manufacturing and purchasing practices and waste generation behaviors to reduce the amount of waste that becomes a governmental responsibility"; and

 WHEREAS, the Washington State Legislature in RCW 70.95.010(6)(c) found that it is the responsibility of city and county governments "to assume primary responsibility for solid waste management and to develop and implement aggressive and effective waste reduction and source separation strategies"; and

 WHEREAS, in 2007 the City Council adopted, the Mayor concurring, Resolution 30990, which reaffirmed the City's 60% recycling goal and set a longer-term goal of 70% recycling along with targets for waste reduction; and

 WHEREAS, Resolution 30990 called for studies on how to reduce Seattleites' use of hard-to-recycle materials, many of them plastics, and specifically required Seattle Public Utilities ("SPU") to propose strategies, including bans, to discourage the use of disposable plastic carryout bags; and

 WHEREAS, SPU has completed some of those studies, finding that the production, use and disposal of plastic carryout bags have significant adverse impacts on the environment; and

 WHEREAS, it is the City's desire to conserve resources, reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, waste, litter and marine litter and pollution and to protect the public health and welfare; and

 WHEREAS, there is a need to conserve energy and natural resources and control litter, and less reliance on single-use carryout bags provided by retail establishments works toward those goals; and

 WHEREAS, plastic carryout bags are made of nonrenewable resources and plastic never biodegrades and only breaks down into smaller and smaller particles which seep into soils or are carried into rivers and lakes, Puget Sound and the world's oceans posing a threat to animal life and the natural food chain; and

 WHEREAS, even though single-use paper carryout bags are made from renewable resources and are less of a litter and particularly marine litter problem than single-use plastic carryout bags, they nevertheless require significant resources to manufacture, transport and recycle or dispose of; and

 WHEREAS, costs associated with the use, recycling and disposal of single-use paper and plastic carryout bags in Seattle creates burdens on the City's solid waste disposal system, including in the case of plastic carryout bags machine down time and contamination of recycled paper at the City's materials recovery facility; and

 WHEREAS, to prevent waste generation it is in the City's interest to discourage the use of single-use, throw-away items of all types which can be accomplished through price signals; and

 WHEREAS, to reduce the use of plastic and paper carryout bags in the City, it is necessary to regulate such use; and

 WHEREAS, it is in the best interest of the health, safety and welfare of the people of the City that regulation require a pass-through charge on the use of recyclable paper carryout bags in order to encourage greater use of reusable bags, to reduce the cost of solid waste disposal by the City, and to protect the environment; NOW, THEREFORE,
