 ORDINANCE _________________

 AN ORDINANCE relating to the 2008 Parks and Green Spaces Levy; accepting the recommendations of the 2008 Parks and Green Spaces Levy Oversight Committee concerning the Development Category Inflation Adjustment and the Opportunity Fund category; reallocating funds from the Development Category to the Opportunity Fund Category; and creating new major maintenance projects in the Opportunity Fund Category; all by a three-fourths vote of the City Council.

 WHEREAS, Ordinance 122749 authorized a proposition to Seattle's voters, a Parks and Green Spaces Levy (Parks Levy) to levy for up to six years regular property taxes in excess of the limitation on levies in Chapter 84.55 RCW for the purposes of acquiring, developing, or restoring parks, recreation facilities, cultural facilities, green spaces, playfields, trails, community gardens, and shoreline areas; and

 WHEREAS, the proposed 2008 Parks Levy was approved by Seattle voters on November 4, 2008; and

 WHEREAS, Ordinance 122749 created four major funding categories for levy funds: 1) Acquisition; 2) Development; 3) Environment; and 4) Opportunity Fund; and

 WHEREAS, the Opportunity Fund category is to fund acquisition and development projects not identified for funding in the remainder of the 2008 Parks Levy program; and

 WHEREAS, Ordinance 122749 established a Parks and Green Spaces Levy Oversight Committee (Oversight Committee), with responsibilities including advising upon expenditures and allocations for the following year, making recommendations on the implementation of particular projects and any reallocations, adopting evaluation criteria and recommending Opportunity Fund awards to the Superintendent, Mayor, and City Council; and

 WHEREAS, the Parks and Green Spaces Levy Development Category includes a $14 million inflation contingency to cover escalating costs on construction and improvement projects in future years; and

 WHEREAS, Parks Levy projects have not experienced inflation to date and have benefitted from a very competitive bid climate due to the economic recession; and

 WHEREAS, the economic recession has led to declining Real Estate Excise Tax (REET) revenues which fund major maintenance projects in parks and other facilities; and

 WHEREAS, based upon the absence of construction industry inflation and reduced REET revenues, the Parks and Green Spaces Levy Oversight Committee recognized that the best use of the Development Category inflation adjustment funds was to support the ongoing preservation of existing park facilities; and

 WHEREAS, on June 27, 2011, the Oversight Committee held a public hearing on a preliminary recommendation to use $9,758,000 of Development Category levy inflation adjustment dollars to fund major maintenance projects and received favorable citizen comment and support; and

 WHEREAS, on July 25, 2011, the Oversight Committee voted in favor of a final recommendation to use $9,758,000 of Development Category levy inflation adjustment dollars to fund major maintenance projects; and

 WHEREAS, the recommended major maintenance projects are not presently included in the Parks and Green Spaces Levy; and

 WHEREAS, Ordinance 122749 provides that, after considering recommendations made by the Oversight Committee, City Council may create new projects in the Opportunity Fund Category and, with a three-fourths vote, transfer Parks Levy allocations across categories and subcategories; and

 WHEREAS, it is anticipated that appropriations for the recommended major maintenance projects will be included in the 2012 Budget and the projects will be included in the 2012-2017 Capital Improvement Program; NOW, THEREFORE,

 BE IT ORDAINED BY THE CITY OF SEATTLE AS FOLLOWS:

 Section 1. Effective January 1, 2012, the Parks and Green Spaces Levy Oversight Committee recommendation to reallocate $9,758,000 within the 2008 Parks Levy Fund from the Development Category Inflation Adjustment to the Opportunity Fund, and to allocate these funds for 17 high priority major maintenance projects, is adopted.
