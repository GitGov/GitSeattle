 ORDINANCE _________________

 AN ORDINANCE relating to the Joint Training Facility Project; amending Ordinance 121179, as last amended by Ordinance 122854, to extend the term of an interfund loan.

 WHEREAS, Ordinance 121179 approved a loan of up to $10.48 million from the Consolidated Cash Pool to the Cumulative Reserve Subfund, Unrestricted Subaccount to be paid back by December 31, 2003; and

 WHEREAS, the proceeds of this loan were to finance expenditures from the Cumulative Reserve Subfund, Unrestricted Account, related to the Joint Training Facility; and

 WHEREAS, the loan proceeds that were temporarily credited to the Cumulative Reserve Subfund have been fully expended to fund the Joint Training Facility Project at 9401 Myers Way South; and

 WHEREAS, the originally anticipated source for loan repayment was the proceeds generated from the sale of excess City- owned property at the Joint Training Facility site; and

 WHEREAS, the sale of this excess property was put on hold while the site was under consideration as a possible location for the Seattle Municipal Jail; and

 WHEREAS, while this site in no longer being considered for the Seattle Municipal Jail, Department of Finance and Administrative Services staff do not expect proceeds from the sale of the Joint Training Facility's excess City- owned property to be available to repay the loan by the December 31, 2010, deadline established in Ordinance 122854; and

 WHEREAS, given that the contemplated property sale is likely not a viable option for repayment

 of the loan, the 2011-12 Proposed Budget implements several strategies in order to bring this account back to a positive balance over the next several years. First, sufficient ongoing expenditures have been shifted to other funding sources in order to create an annual surplus of revenues over expenditures in the account. This ensures that the account does not decline further into deficit over time. Second, annual contributions beginning in 2012 from the General Fund will bring the fund balance back into positive territory. Third, the interfund loan for this account is extended to December 31, 2012, to begin to accommodate the time needed to address this issue; and

 WHEREAS, in the normal course of business the City may temporarily lend cash between funds to maintain required balances; NOW, THEREFORE,

 BE IT ORDAINED BY THE CITY OF SEATTLE AS FOLLOWS:

 Section 1. In order to extend through 2012 the term of a loan of $10.48 million to the Cumulative Reserve Subfund from the Consolidated Cash Pool, Section 3 of Ordinance 121179, as last amended by Section 1 of Ordinance 122854, is hereby further amended as follows:

 Section 3. The entire principal loaned as authorized in Section 2, with interest thereon at the rate of return of the City's Consolidated Cash Pool, shall be repaid no later than ((~~December 31, 2010~~))  December 31, 2012 , unless extended by ordinance.

 Section 2. This ordinance shall take effect and be in force 30 days from and after its approval by the Mayor, but if not approved and returned by the Mayor within ten days after presentation, it shall take effect as provided by Seattle Municipal Code Section 1.04.020.

 Passed by the City Council the ____ day of ________________________, 2010, and signed by me in open session in authentication of its passage this _____ day of ___________________, 2010.
