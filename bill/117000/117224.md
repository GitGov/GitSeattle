 ORDINANCE _________________

 AN ORDINANCE relating to leasing excess capacity of City conduit; authorizing the Chief Technology Officer to enter into lease agreements whereby excess inner ducts in City-owned conduit in the Pioneer Square area are leased to private parties for the installation of fiber optic cable to provide broadband internet services to residents and businesses; and ratifying and confirming certain prior acts.

 WHEREAS, as part of a City Light construction project, the City installed underground conduit in the Pioneer Square area for use by King County Metro and to ensure future availability for the City; and

 WHEREAS, King County Metro plans a future installation of fiber optic cable in the conduit for transportation purposes; and

 WHEREAS, it is the Department of Information Technology's customary practice to install the maximum feasible amount of inner duct in conduit when the conduit will be used for fiber installation; and

 WHEREAS, at this time, the City and County only require one inner duct in the Pioneer Square conduit to be reserved for governmental use, making two additional inner ducts excess to the City's needs; NOW, THEREFORE,

 BE IT ORDAINED BY THE CITY OF SEATTLE AS FOLLOWS:

 Section 1. For purposes of this ordinance "Pioneer Square Area" means the area bordered by Alaskan Way and Alaskan Way South on the west, 4th Avenue and 4th Avenue South on the east, South Jackson Street on the south, and Columbia Street on the north.

 Section 2. The Chief Technology Officer ("CTO") is authorized to execute, for and on behalf of the City of Seattle, one or more lease agreements with private entities or persons for lease of any inner duct under the management of the Department of Information Technology that is not needed for City use and is within the Pioneer Square Area. The CTO is also authorized to execute agreements that include the lease of excess inner duct within conduit or vaults under the management of any other City department; provided that the CTO shall first obtain the permission of that City department and the CTO shall ensure that the department is reimbursed according to the department's standard rates.

 Section 3. Any lease entered into under the authority of this ordinance shall limit the use of the inner duct to the installation of fiber optic cable only. Any lease that the CTO executes must require that the lessee offer broadband internet services to all residents and businesses in buildings feasibly served by the conduit. The CTO's authority under this ordinance is limited as follows:

 A. The total term of any lease, including any options to extend the lease, shall not exceed ten years; however, this limitation shall not restrict the CTO's authority to negotiate with the same lessee for a subsequent lease of the same inner duct on terms consistent with this ordinance; and

 B. The rental rate payable to the City under the lease shall be an amount determined by the CTO to be reasonable under the circumstances based upon market conditions and the following factors: the cost of the installation of conduit and inner duct; the number of other users contributing to the cost of conduit and inner duct installation; and the lease rates charged by Seattle City Light or Seattle Department of Transportation for use of inner duct within conduit or vault space, subject to adjustment during the lease term; and

 C. The CTO shall use a lease form prepared with the assistance and advice of the City Attorney's Office.

 Section 4. No lease entered into under the authority of this ordinance shall be deemed to grant any franchise rights for cable television or other service to any inner duct lessee, nor shall any lease be deemed to extend, replace, or modify any existing or future franchise agreements between the City and any franchisee.

 Section 5. Any act taken after passage of this ordinance but prior to its effective date is ratified and confirmed.

 Section 6. This ordinance shall take effect and be in force 30 days after its approval by the Mayor, but if not approved and returned by the Mayor within ten days after presentation, it shall take effect as provided by Seattle Municipal Code Section 1.04.020.

 Passed by the City Council the ____ day of ________________________, 2011, and signed by me in open session in authentication of its passage this ______day of ___________________, 2011.
