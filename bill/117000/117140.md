 Section 3. Section 23.34.108 of the Seattle Municipal Code, which section was enacted by Ordinance 117430, is amended as follows:

 23.34.108 Downtown Mixed Commercial (DMC) zone, function and locational criteria((~~.~~))

 Locations appropriate for Downtown Mixed Commercial zone designation (( ~~shall be~~))  are  consistent with the following:

 A. Function. Areas characterized by lower scale office, retail and commercial uses related to activity in the office  core,  (( ~~and~~)) retail  core or other moderate-scale commercial  cores  in the Downtown Urban Center ,  and with use patterns that may include  (( ~~mixed with~~)) housing (( ~~and associated residential services~~)).

 B. Scale and Character of Development. (( ~~The scale of~~))  Areas where  buildings (( ~~shall be~~))  of  moderate (( ~~in height and mass~~))  scale exist or are appropriate  to provide a physical transition between (( ~~the high density office~~))  more intensive commercial  areas and surrounding lower scale  commercial,  mixed use (( ~~and~~))  or  residential districts.

 C. Transportation and Infrastructure Capacity. Areas  within the Downtown Urban Center  having  good but comparatively  less accessibility to vehicular and transit systems than the (( ~~concentrated office districts~~))  Downtown office core . Transportation and other infrastructure capacities (( ~~shall be~~))  are  capable of accommodating modest growth without major improvement.

 D. Relationship to Surrounding Activity. Areas that provide  for  less intensive activity along the western and northern edges of the (( ~~retail and office cores~~))  Downtown retail core and Downtown office core, or at other peripheral locations within the Downtown Urban Center . These areas (( ~~shall~~)) provide a buffer to less intensive areas, such as the Harborfront, Pike Place Market, (( ~~and Denny Regrade~~))  Belltown  residential area ,  (( ~~to the west and the Neighborhood Commercial~~))  or mixed use  areas north of Denny Way  , or serve as a transition to less intensive commercial, residential or industrial areas near the Downtown Urban Center .

 E. Heights. (( ~~Five (5)~~))  Downtown Mixed Commercial  height designations (( ~~shall~~)) provide desired transitions compatible with adjacent downtown districts and (( ~~those~~)) areas outside downtown.

 Section 4. Section 23.34.110 of the Seattle Municipal Code, which section was enacted by Ordinance 117430, is amended as follows:

 23.34.110 Downtown Mixed Residential (DMR) zone, function and locational criteria((~~.~~))

 Locations appropriate for Downtown Mixed Residential zone designation (( ~~shall be~~))  are consistent with the following:

 A. Function. Areas that provide a mixed use community where housing and associated services and amenities predominate. Office, retail and other commercial uses (( ~~shall be~~))  are  compatibly integrated with the predominant residential character at low to moderate densities.

 B. Scale and Character of Development. Areas where there is an existing base of housing and the potential exists for establishing a residential community. Areas (( ~~shall~~)) have the potential for supporting a wide range of residential building types, ranging from midrise structures closely related to the street to larger tower forms. Opportunities (( ~~shall~~)) exist for major public amenities, such as parks and open space , an enhanced pedestrian network, or  (( ~~and~~)) views of downtown(( ~~.~~)) ,  Elliott Bay (( ~~and~~))  or other  surrounding (( ~~land forms~~))  features .

 C. Transportation and Infrastructure Capacity. Areas with (( ~~adequate~~)) transportation  system  and infrastructure  system  capacity  that is sufficient or can be improved  to accommodate a substantial residential population. Employment densities (( ~~shall be~~))  are  related to the ability of the transportation system to accommodate peak hour  traffic  flow without adversely affecting the residential (( ~~development~~))  environment .

 D. Relationship to Surrounding Activity. Areas (( ~~where there are~~))  with  surrounding mixed use (( ~~areas~~))  districts  providing transition between (( ~~the~~))  primarily  residential (( ~~community~~))  districts (within or outside downtown)  and higher intensity  neighborhood  core areas (( ~~of~~))  within  downtown.

 E. Mix of Use. Two (( ~~(2) mix of use~~))  mix-of-use  designations (( ~~shall be~~))  are applied to achieve subarea objectives. The DMR/R designation (( ~~shall apply~~))  applies  to areas predominantly residential in character or containing large amounts of underused land  able to accommodate future residential development ; non-residential uses may be present but should be of modest scale, likely to change in the future, or neighborhood serving in character. The DMR/C designation (( ~~shall apply~~))  applies  to those areas containing housing or having housing potential where larger scale, non-residential serving commercial development exists and is likely to remain.

 F. Heights. (( ~~One (1) of three (3)~~))  Downtown Mixed Residential  building height designations may be applied to achieve subarea objectives. The lowest height designation (( ~~shall~~)) generally (( ~~be centered on~~))  encompasses the  Belltown  core , in areas characterized by existing modest scale development, buildings of historic character ,  or topographic features such as the bluff rising from Elliott Bay. The intermediate (( ~~area~~))  building height designation  (( ~~shall~~)) provide s  transition in height and density to the north  and east  of  the  Belltown  core  and along the bluff where (( ~~larger scale commercial buildings~~))  waterfront development  divide s  the area from Elliott Bay. In the Downtown Urban Center east of Interstate 5, the building height designation provides for low to moderate heights.  The highest  building  height  designation  (( ~~and density shall apply~~))  applies  to areas (( ~~now~~)) characterized by larger residential and commercial buildings, generally (( ~~north and east of Belltown~~))  along the eastern edge of Belltown,  near the higher density mixed commercial areas of downtown.

 Section 5. Section 23.34.114 of the Seattle Municipal Code, which section was last amended by Ordinance 119484, is amended as follows:

 23.34.114 International District Mixed (IDM) zone, locational criteria(( ~~.~~))

 The International District Mixed zone designation (( ~~shall be considered~~))  is appropriate  for areas of the International Special Review District designated in Chapter 23.66 of the Land Use Code for mixed use development. The areas designated IDM (( ~~shall be~~))  are  characterized by a mix of uses contained in low and medium scale structures (( ~~and include the area west of Fifth Avenue South bordering Pioneer Square~~)).

 Section 6. Section 23.34.116 of the Seattle Municipal Code, which section was last amended by Ordinance 119484, is amended as follows:

 23.34.116 International District Residential (IDR) zone, locational criteria(( ~~.~~))

 The International District Residential zone designation (( ~~shall be considered~~))  is appropriate  for areas of the International Special  Review  District designated in Chapter 23.66 of the Land Use Code for development as a predominantly residential neighborhood. The areas designated IDR (( ~~shall be~~))  are  generally located north of the International District core,  near the Downtown office core, and  contain parcels available for infill development and , east of 5th Avenue, may  possess topographic features providing view potential.  The IDR/C designation applies to areas where a mix of non-residential uses and residential uses will provide for a transition in use character between the Downtown office core and areas within the International Special Review District designated primarily for residential uses.

A structure in a DMC 340/290-400 zone on a lot comprising a full block that abuts a DOC1 zone along at least one street frontage may gain additional structure height of (( ~~thirty (30)~~))  30  percent above the maximum residential height limit if the structure uses the bonus available under  Section  23.49.015, or (( ~~thirty-five (35)~~))  35  percent above 340 feet if that bonus is not used, in either case on the following conditions:

 a. Only one tower is permitted on the lot;

 b. Any additional floor area above the maximum height limit for nonresidential or live-work use, as increased under this subsection  23.49.008. A  . 4, is occupied by residential use;

 c. The average residential gross floor area and maximum residential floor area of any story in the portion of the tower permitted above the base residential height limit (( ~~does~~))  do  not exceed the limits prescribed in (( ~~Section~~))  subsection  23.49.058 . D . 1;

 d. Any residential floor area allowed above the base residential height limit under this provision is gained through voluntary agreements to provide low-income or moderate-income housing according to (( ~~the provisions of~~))  Section  23.49.015;

 e. At least (( ~~thirty-five (35)~~))  35  percent of the lot area, or a minimum of 25,000 square feet, whichever is greater, is in open space use substantially at street level meeting the  following  standards, and subject to the  following  allowances for coverage(( ~~, in this subsection e.~~)) :

 (( ~~i.~~))  1)  The location and configuration of the space shall enhance solar exposure, allow easy access to entrances to the tower serving all tenants and occupants from streets abutting the open space, and allow convenient pedestrian circulation through all portions of the open space. The open space shall be entirely contiguous and physically accessible. To offset the impact of the taller structure allowed, the open space must have frontage at grade abutting sidewalks, and be visible from sidewalks, on at least two streets. The elevation of the space may vary, especially on sloping lots where terracing the space facilitates connections to abutting streets, provided that grade changes are gradual and do not significantly disrupt the continuity of the space, and no part of the open space is significantly above the grade of the nearest abutting street. The Director may allow greater grade changes, as necessary, to facilitate access to transit tunnel stations.

 (( ~~ii.~~))  2)  Up to (( ~~twenty (20)~~))  20  percent of the area used to satisfy the open space condition to allowing additional height may be covered by the following features: permanent, freestanding structures, such as retail kiosks, pavilions, or pedestrian shelters; structural overhangs; overhead arcades or other forms of overhead weather protection; and any other features approved by the Director that contribute to pedestrian comfort and active use of the space. The following features within the open space area may count as open space and are not subject to the percentage coverage limit: temporary kiosks and pavilions, public art, permanent seating that is not reserved for any commercial use, exterior stairs and mechanical assists that provide access to public areas and are available for public use, and any similar features approved by the Director.

 f. Open space used to satisfy the condition to allowing additional height in this section is not eligible for a bonus under Section 23.49.013.

 g. Open space used to satisfy the condition to allowing additional height in this section may qualify as common recreation area to the extent permitted by (( ~~SMC~~)) subsection 23.49.011 . B and may be used to satisfy open space requirements in (( ~~SMC~~)) subsection 23.49.016 . C . 1 if it satisfies the standards of that subsection.

 h. No increase in height shall be granted to any proposed development that would result in significant alteration to any designated feature of a landmark structure, unless a certificate of approval for the alteration is granted by the Landmarks Preservation Board.

 5. In (( ~~the~~))  a  DRC zone, the base height limit is (( ~~eighty-five (85)~~))  85  feet, except that, subject to the conditions in subsection  23.49.008. A . 6 (( ~~of this section~~)):

 a. The base height limit is (( ~~one hundred fifty (150)~~))  150  feet if any of the following conditions is satisfied:

 (( ~~i.~~))  1)  all portions of a structure above (( ~~eighty-five (85)~~))  85  feet contain only residential use; or

 (( ~~ii.~~))  2)  at least (( ~~twenty-five (25)~~))  25  percent of the gross floor area of all structures on a lot is in residential use; or

 (( ~~iii.~~))  3)  a minimum of 1.5 FAR of retail sales and service or entertainment uses, or any combination thereof, is provided on the lot.

 b. For residential floor area created by infill of a light well on a Landmark structure, the base height limit is the lesser of (( ~~one hundred fifty (150)~~))  150  feet or the highest level at which the light well is enclosed by the full length of walls of the structure on at least (( ~~three (3)~~))  three  sides. For the purpose of this subsection a light well is defined as an inward modulation on a non-street facing facade that is enclosed on at least (( ~~three (3)~~))  three  sides by walls of the same structure, and infill is defined as an addition to that structure within the light well.

 6. Restrictions on Demolition and Alteration of Existing Structures.

 a. Any structure in a DRC zone that would exceed the (( ~~eighty-five (85)~~))  85  foot base height limit shall incorporate the existing exterior street front facade(s) of each of the structures listed below, if any, located on the lot of that project. The City Council finds that these structures are significant to the architecture, history and character of downtown. The Director may permit changes to the exterior facade(s) to the extent that significant features are preserved and the visual integrity of the design is maintained. The degree of exterior preservation required will vary, depending upon the nature of the project and the characteristics of the affected structure(s).

 b. The Director shall evaluate whether the manner in which the facade is proposed to be preserved meets the intent to preserve the architecture, character and history of the Retail Core. If a structure on the lot is a Landmark structure, approval by the Landmarks Preservation Board for any proposed modifications to controlled features is required prior to a decision by the Director to allow or condition additional height for the project. The Landmarks Preservation Board's decision shall be incorporated into the Director's decision. Inclusion of a structure on the list below is solely for the purpose of conditioning additional height under this subsection, and shall not be interpreted in any way to prejudge the structure's merit as a Landmark:

</table> B. Standards for Sending Lots.

 1.  Maximum transferable floor area except from lots in South Downtown. This subsection 23.49.014.B.1 applies to sending lots that are not in South Downtown.

 a. The maximum amount of floor area that may be transferred, except as open space TDR, Landmark TDR, or Landmark housing TDR, from an eligible sending lot(( ~~, except a sending lot in the PSM or IDM zones~~)), is the amount by which the product of the eligible lot area times the base FAR of the sending lot, as provided in Section 23.49.011, exceeds the sum of any chargeable gross floor area existing or, if a DMC housing TDR site, to be developed on the sending lot, plus any TDR previously transferred from the sending lot.

 b. The maximum amount of floor area that may be transferred from an eligible open space TDR site is the amount by which the product of the eligible lot area times the base FAR of the sending lot, as provided in Section 23.49.011, exceeds the sum of  ( a) any existing chargeable gross floor area that is built on or over the portion of the sending lot that is not made ineligible by (( ~~Section~~))  subsection  23.49.017.C, plus  ( b) the amount, if any, by which the total of any other chargeable floor area on the sending lot exceeds the product of the base FAR of the sending lot, as provided in Section 23.49.011, multiplied by the difference between the total lot area and the eligible lot area, plus  ( c) any TDR previously transferred from the sending lot.

 c. The maximum amount of floor area that may be transferred from an eligible Landmark housing TDR site is the amount by which the product of the eligible lot area times the base FAR of the sending lot, as provided in Section 23.49.011, exceeds TDR previously transferred from the sending lot, if any.

 d. The maximum amount of floor area that may be transferred from an eligible Landmark TDR site, (( ~~when~~))  if  the chargeable floor area of the landmark structure is less than or equal to the base FAR permitted in the zone, is equivalent to the base FAR of the sending lot, minus any TDR that have been previously transferred. For landmark structures having chargeable floor area greater than the base FAR of the zone, the amount of floor area that may be transferred is limited to an amount equivalent to the base FAR of the sending lot minus the sum of (( ~~(i)~~)) (a)  any chargeable floor area of the landmark structure exceeding the base FAR and (( ~~(ii)~~)) (b)  any TDR that have been previously transferred.

 e. For purposes of this subsection 23.49.014.B.1, the eligible lot area is the total area of the sending lot, reduced by the excess, if any, of the total of accessory surface parking over 1/4 of the total area of the footprints of all structures on the sending lot; and for an open space TDR site, further reduced by the area of any portion of the lot ineligible under (( ~~Section~~)) subsection  23.49.017.C.

 2.  TDR from lots in South Downtown. This subsection 23.49.014.B.2 applies to sending lots in South Downtown.

 a.  If the sending lot is located in (( ~~the~~))  a  PSM or IDM zone,  then subject to any lower limit under this subsection 23.49.014.B.2,  the gross floor area that may be transferred is (( ~~6 FAR~~))  six times the lot area , minus the sum of any existing chargeable floor area (( ~~and any floor area in residential use on the sending lot,~~)) and further reduced by any TDR previously transferred from the sending lot.

 b. If the sending lot is not located in a PSM or IDM zone, then subject to any lower limit under this subsection 23.49.014.B.2, the gross floor area that may be transferred is the amount by which the product of the eligible lot area times the base FAR of the sending lot, as provided in Section 23.49.011, exceeds the sum of any chargeable floor area existing on the sending lot, plus any TDR previously transferred from the sending lot.

 c. The cumulative amount of housing TDR transferred from any lot in South Downtown shall not exceed three times the lot area.

 d. The cumulative amount of open space TDR transferred from any lot in South Downtown shall not exceed three times the lot area.

 e. The cumulative amount of South Downtown Historic TDR transferred from any lot shall not exceed three times the lot area.

 f. The cumulative combined amount of TDR and TDP transferred from any lot in South Downtown shall not exceed six times the lot area.

 g. For purposes of this subsection 23.49.014.B.2, the eligible lot area is the total area of the sending lot, reduced by the excess, if any, of the total of accessory surface parking over 1/4 of the total area of the footprints of all structures on the sending lot; and for an open space TDR site, further reduced by any portion of the lot ineligible under subsection 23.49.017.C.

 3.  Effect of transfer in zones with base FAR limits.  If TDR are transferred from a sending lot in a zone with a base FAR limit,  except an IDM zone,  the amount of chargeable (( ~~gross~~)) floor area that may then be (( ~~built~~))  established  on the sending lot is equal to the  amount by which the  area of the lot ,  multiplied by the applicable base FAR limit set in Section 23.49.011, (( ~~minus~~))  exceeds  the total of:

 a. The existing chargeable floor area on the lot; plus

 b. The amount of gross floor area transferred from the lot.

 4.  Effect of transfer in PSM and IDM zones.

 a.  If TDR are (( ~~sent~~))  transferred  from a sending lot in a PSM zone, the (( ~~combined maximum~~))  amount of  chargeable floor area (( ~~and residential floor area~~)) that may then be established on the sending lot is equal to the  amount by which the  total gross floor area that could have been built on the sending lot consistent with applicable development standards as determined by the Director had no TDR been transferred(( ~~, less~~))  exceeds  the sum of:

 (( ~~a.~~))  1)  The existing chargeable floor area on the lot; plus

 (( ~~b.~~))  2)  The (( ~~amount of~~)) gross floor area (( ~~that was~~))  of TDR  transferred from the lot.

 b. If TDR are transferred from a sending lot in an IDM zone, the amount of chargeable floor area that may then be established on the sending lot shall not exceed the amount by which the applicable base FAR limit in Section 23.49.011 multiplied by the lot area exceeds the sum of:

 1) The existing chargeable floor area on the lot; plus

 2) The gross floor area of TDR transferred from the lot.

 5.  TDR from lots with more than base FAR not allowed; exception.  Gross floor area allowed above base FAR under any bonus provisions of this (( ~~title~~)) Title 23  or the former Title 24, or allowed under any exceptions or waivers of development standards, may not be transferred. TDR may be transferred from a lot that contains chargeable floor area exceeding the base FAR only if the TDR are from an eligible Landmark  TDR  site, consistent with subsection 23.49.014.B.1.c (( ~~above~~)), or to the extent, if any, that:

 a. TDR were previously transferred to such lot in compliance with the Land Use Code provisions and applicable rules then in effect;

 b. Those TDR, together with the base FAR under Section 23.49.011, exceed the chargeable floor area on the lot and any additional chargeable floor area for which any permit has been issued or for which any permit application is pending; and

 c. The excess amount of TDR previously transferred to such lot would have been eligible for transfer from the original sending lot under (( ~~the provisions of~~)) Section 23.49.014 at the time of their original transfer from that lot.

 6.  Rehabilitation of Landmark structures and contributing structures.  Landmark structures on sending lots from which Landmark TDR or Landmark housing TDR are transferred shall be (( ~~restored~~))  rehabilitated  and maintained as required by the Landmarks Preservation Board.  Contributing structures under Section 23.66.032 on sending lots from which South Downtown Historic TDR are transferred shall be rehabilitated and maintained as required by the Director of Neighborhoods upon recommendation by the International Special Review District Board or the Pioneer Square Preservation Board.

 7.  Rehabilitation of housing.  Housing on lots from which housing TDR are transferred shall be rehabilitated to the extent required to provide decent, sanitary and habitable conditions, in compliance with applicable codes, and so as to have an estimated minimum useful life of at least 50 years from the time of the TDR transfer, as approved by the Director of (( ~~the Office of~~)) Housing. Landmark buildings on lots from which Landmark housing TDR are transferred shall be rehabilitated to the extent required to provide decent, sanitary and habitable housing, in compliance with applicable codes, and so as to have an estimated minimum useful life of at least 50 years from the time of the TDR transfer, as approved by the Director of (( ~~the Office of~~)) Housing and (( ~~the Landmarks Preservation Board~~))  Director of Neighborhoods . If housing TDR or Landmark housing TDR are proposed to be transferred prior to the completion of work necessary to satisfy this subsection 23.49.014.B.7, the Director of (( ~~the Office of~~)) Housing may require, as a condition to such transfer, that security be deposited with the City to ensure the completion of such work.

 8.  Low-income housing units.  The housing units on a lot from which housing TDR, Landmark housing TDR, or DMC housing TDR are transferred, and that are committed to low- income housing use as a condition to eligibility of the lot as a TDR sending lot, shall be generally comparable in their average size and quality of construction to other housing units in the same structure, in the judgment of the (( ~~Housing~~)) Director  of Housing , after completion of any rehabilitation or construction undertaken in order to qualify as a TDR sending lot.

 9. Standards for eligibility as a South Downtown Historic TDR sending lot.

 a. In order to be eligible to transfer South Downtown Historic TDR, a lot must contain a structure that includes at least 5,000 gross square feet in above-grade space and was finally determined to be a contributing structure under Section 23.66.032.

 b. Contributing structures on a sending lot from which South Downtown Historic TDR are transferred shall be rehabilitated and maintained as required by the Director of Neighborhoods.

 c. As a condition to finally allow the transfer of South Downtown Historic TDR from a lot, the applicant must certify that the contributing structure continues to meet any conditions identified by the Director of Neighborhoods pursuant to subsection 23.66.032.C within no more than three years prior to the recordation of the deed conveying the TDR from the sending lot.

 d. South Downtown Historic TDR shall not be transferred from a lot from which South Downtown Historic TDP has been transferred or from a lot on which any extra floor area has been established based on the presence of a contributing structure.

 C. Limit on within-block TDR. Any receiving lot is limited to a gain of (( ~~fifteen (15)~~))  15  percent of the floor area above the first increment of FAR above the base FAR, as specified in subsection 23.49.011 . A . 2  . a, from TDR from sending lots that are eligible to send TDR solely because they are on the same block as the receiving lot.

 D. Transfer of Development Rights Deeds and Agreements.

 1. The fee owners of the sending lot shall execute a deed with the written consent of all holders of encumbrances on the sending lot, unless (in the case of TDR from a housing TDR site, Landmark housing TDR site or DMC housing TDR site) such consent is waived by the Director (( ~~of the Office~~)) of Housing for good cause, which deed shall be recorded in the King County real property records. (( ~~When~~))  If  TDR are conveyed to the owner of a receiving lot described in the deed, then unless otherwise expressly stated in the deed or any subsequent instrument conveying such lot or the TDR, the TDR shall pass with the receiving lot whether or not a structure using such TDR shall have been permitted or built prior to any conveyance of the receiving lot. Any subsequent conveyance of TDR previously conveyed to a receiving lot shall require the written consent of all parties holding any interest in or lien on the receiving lot from which the conveyance is made.

Any deed conveying any South Downtown Historic TDR from the sending lot shall include a sworn certification by the grantor to the effect that one or more structures on the sending lot have been finally determined to be contributing structures pursuant to Section 23.66.032, and that since the date of such determination there have been no material changes to any contributing structure on the sending lot, except pursuant to a certificate of approval specifically stating that the authorized change will not affect the status of the structure as a contributing structure. Any false certification by the grantor in a deed under this subsection 23.49.014.D.1 is a violation of this title.

 2. Any person may purchase any TDR that are eligible for transfer by complying with the applicable provisions of this (( ~~section~~))  Section 23.49.014 , whether or not the purchaser is then an applicant for a permit to develop downtown real property. Any purchaser of such TDR (including any successor or assignee) may use such TDR to obtain chargeable floor area above the applicable base on a receiving lot to the extent such use of TDR is permitted under the Land Use Code provisions in effect on the date of vesting, under applicable law, of such person's rights with respect to the issuance of permits for development of the project intended to use such TDR. The Director may require, as a condition of processing any permit application using TDR or for the release of any security posted in lieu of a deed for TDR to the receiving lot, that the owner of the receiving lot demonstrate that the TDR have been validly transferred of record to the receiving lot, and that such owner has recorded in the real estate records a notice of the filing of such permit application, stating that such TDR are not available for retransfer.

 3. For transfers of housing TDR, Landmark housing TDR, or DMC housing TDR, the owner of the sending lot shall execute and record an agreement, with the written consent of all holders of encumbrances on the sending lot, unless such consent is waived by the Director  of Housing (( ~~of the Office of Housing~~)) for good cause, to provide for the maintenance of the required housing on the sending lot for a minimum of (( ~~fifty (50)~~))  50  years. Such agreement shall commit to limits on rent and occupancy, consistent with the definition of housing TDR site, Landmark housing TDR site, or DMC housing TDR site, as applicable, and acceptable to the Director of (( ~~the Office of~~)) Housing.

 4. For transfers of Landmark TDR or Landmark housing TDR, the owner of the sending lot shall execute and record an agreement in form and content acceptable to the Landmarks Preservation Board providing for the (( ~~restoration~~))  rehabilitation  and maintenance of the historically significant features of the structure or structures on the lot.

 (( ~~5~~)) 6 . A deed conveying TDR may require or permit the return of the TDR to the sending lot under specified conditions, but notwithstanding any such provisions:

 a. The transfer of TDR to a receiving lot shall remain effective so long as any portion of any structure for which a permit was issued based upon such transfer remains on the receiving lot; and

 b. The City shall not be required to recognize any return of TDR unless it is demonstrated that all parties in the chain of title have executed, acknowledged and recorded instruments conveying any interest in the TDR back to the sending lot and any lien holders have released any liens thereon.

 (( ~~6~~)) 7 . Any agreement governing the use or development of the sending lot shall provide that its covenants or conditions shall run with the land and shall be specifically enforceable by The City of Seattle.

 E. TDR Sales Before Base FAR Increases and Changes in Exemptions. Except for transfers of TDR from a sending lot with a major performing arts facility, transfers of TDR from any lot from which a TDR transfer was made prior to  August 26, 2001  (( ~~the effective date of Ordinance 120443~~)) are limited to the amount of TDR available from such lot immediately prior to (( ~~such~~))  that  date.

 F. Projects Developed Under Prior Code Provisions.

 1. Any project that is developed pursuant to a master use permit issued under the provisions of this title as in effect prior to  August 26, 2001  (( ~~the effective date of Ordinance 120443~~)), which permit provides for the use of TDR, may use TDR that were transferred from the sending lot consistent with such prior provisions prior to  August 26, 2001  (( ~~such effective date~~)).

 2. In addition or in the alternative, such a project may use TDR that are transferred from a sending lot  on or  after (( ~~the effective date of Ordinance 120443~~))  August 26, 2001 .

 3. The use of TDR by any such project must be consistent with the provisions of (( ~~this title~~))  Title 23  applicable to the project, including any limits on the range of FAR in which a type of TDR may be used, except that open space TDR may be used by such a project in lieu of any other TDR or any bonus, or both, allowable under such provisions.

 G. TDR Satisfying Conditions to Transfer Under Prior Code.

 1. If the conditions to transfer Landmark TDR, as in effect immediately prior to (( ~~the effective date of Ordinance 120443~~))  August 26, 2001 , (( ~~are~~)) were  satisfied on or before December 31, 2001, such TDR may be transferred from the sending lot in the amounts eligible for transfer as determined under the provisions of this (( ~~title~~))  Title 23  in effect immediately prior to (( ~~the effective date of Ordinance 120443~~)) August 26, 2001 . If the conditions to transfer housing TDR (( ~~are~~))  were  satisfied prior to (( ~~the effective date of Ordinance 120443~~))  August 26, 2001  under the provisions of this (( ~~title~~))  Title 23  then in effect, such TDR may be transferred from the sending lot in the amounts eligible for transfer immediately prior to that (( ~~effective~~)) date. If the conditions to transfer TDR from a major performing arts facility (( ~~are~~)) were  satisfied prior to (( ~~the effective date of Ordinance 120443~~))  August 26, 2001  under the provisions of this Title  23  then in effect,  such TDR may be transferred from the sending lot after that (( ~~effective~~)) date, for use on any receiving lots in zones where housing TDR may be used according to Table  A for  23.49.014 (( ~~A~~)) or as provided in Section 23.50.053, in an amount as determined under subsection  23.49.014. B (( ~~of this section~~)), provided that the cumulative amount of TDR that may be transferred after June 1, 2005 from any sending lot based on the presence of a major performing arts facility is limited to (( ~~one hundred fifty thousand (150,000)~~))  150,000  square feet.

 2. For purposes of this subsection, conditions to transfer include, without limitations, the execution by the owner of the sending lot, and recording in the King County real property records, of any agreement required by the provisions of this (( ~~title~~))  Title 23  or the Public Benefit Features Rule in effect immediately prior to (( ~~the effective date of Ordinance 120443~~)) August 26, 2001 , but such conditions do not include any requirement for a master use permit application for a project intending to use TDR, or any action connected with a receiving lot. TDR transferable under this subsection  23.49.014. G are eligible either for use consistent with the terms of Section 23.49.011 or Section 23.50.051 or for use by projects developed pursuant to permits issued under the provisions of this (( ~~title~~))  Title 23  in effect prior to (( ~~the effective date of Ordinance 120443~~)) August 26, 2001 . The use of TDR transferred under this subsection  23.49.014. G on the receiving lot shall be subject only to those conditions and limits that apply for purposes of the master use permit decision for the project using the TDR.

 H. Time of Determination of TDR Eligible for Transfer. Except as stated in subsection  23.49.014. G, the eligibility of a sending lot to transfer TDR, and the amount transferable from a sending lot, shall be determined as of the date of transfer from the sending lot and shall not be affected by the date of any application, permit decision or other action for any project seeking to use such TDR.

 I. Use of Previously Transferred TDR by New Projects. Any project using TDR according to applicable limits on types and amounts of TDR in Section 23.49.011 may use TDR that were transferred from the sending lot consistent with the provisions of this (( ~~title~~)) Title 23  in effect at the time of such transfer. For purposes of this subsection  23.49.014. I, the owner of TDR that were transferred based upon a housing commitment accepted by the City shall be entitled to have such TDR considered as housing TDR.

 Section 13. The title and subsection A.1 of Section 23.49.015 of the Seattle Municipal Code, which section was last amended by Ordinance 123046, are amended as follows:

 23.49.015 Bonus residential floor area  in DOC1, DOC2 and DMC zones outside South Downtown  for voluntary agreements for low-income housing and moderate-income housing(( ~~.~~))

 A. General Provisions.

 1. The purpose of this (( ~~section~~))  Section 23.49.015  is to encourage residential development in addition to that authorized by basic zoning regulations ("bonus development"), provided that certain adverse impacts from the bonus development are mitigated.  This Section 23.49.015 does not apply within South Downtown.  "Basic zoning regulations" for purposes of this (( ~~section~~))  Section 23.49.015  are the provisions of Section 23.49.008 that determine base height limits for residential use in (( ~~DOC-1~~))  DOC1 , (( ~~DOC-2~~))  DOC2  and DMC zones, and for DMC zones, the provisions of Section 23.49.058 that determine the maximum average floor area per story. The City has determined that one impact of high-rise residential development is an increased need for low-income housing and moderate-income housing (( ~~downtown~~)) to house the families of workers having lower paid jobs who serve the residents of such development. The City also finds that (( ~~DOC-1~~)) DOC1 , (( ~~DOC-2~~)) DOC2 , and DMC zones are areas in which increased residential development will assist in achieving local growth management and housing policies, and has determined that increased residential development capacity and height of residential structures can be achieved within these zones, subject to consideration of other regulatory controls on development. The City Council finds that in the case of affordable housing for rental occupancy, use of the income level for low-income housing rather than a lower level is necessary to address local housing market conditions, and that in the case of affordable housing for owner occupancy, higher income levels than those for low-income housing are needed to address local housing market conditions. The City hereby adopts the extension of the authority of (( ~~Chapter 149, Laws of 2006 of the State of Washington, to the bonus development program under this Section 23.49.015~~))  RCW 36.70A.540, as amended ,  and enacts this Section 23.49.015 pursuant to such authority,  in addition to the City's preexisting authority. To the extent that any provision of this Section  23.49.015  or the application thereof to any project for which a Master Use Permit application is considered under the Land Use Code as in effect after (( ~~the effective date of Section 2 of Chapter 149, Laws of 2006~~))  June 7, 2006  would conflict with any requirement of (( ~~that statute~~))  RCW 36.70A.540, as it may be amended , the terms of this Section  23.49.015  shall be deemed modified to conform to the  applicable  requirements of (( ~~Section 2 of Chapter 149, Laws of 2006~~))  RCW 36.70A.540 .

 ***

 Section 14. Subsections C and H of Section 23.49.019 of the Seattle Municipal Code, which section was last amended by Ordinance 123046, are amended as follows:

 23.49.019 Parking quantity, location and access requirements, and screening and landscaping of surface parking areas.

 * * *

 C. Maximum Parking Limit for Nonresidential Uses.

 1. Except as provided in subsections  23.49.019. C . 2 , 23.49.019.C.3,  and 23.66.342.B (( ~~below~~)), parking for nonresidential uses is limited to a maximum of one parking space per (( ~~one thousand (1,000)~~))  1,000  square feet.

 2.  Parking for nonresidential uses in excess of the maximum quantities identified in subsections 23.49.019.C.1 and 23.49.019.C. 3 (( ~~More than one (1) parking space per one thousand (1,000) square feet of nonresidential use~~)) may be permitted as a special exception pursuant to Chapter 23.76. When deciding whether to grant a special exception, the Director shall consider evidence of parking demand and alternative means of transportation, including but not limited to the following:

 a. Whether the additional parking will substantially encourage the use of single occupancy vehicles;

 b. Characteristics of the work force and employee hours, such as multiple shifts that end when transit service is not readily available;

 c. Proximity of transit lines to the lot and headway times of those lines;

 b. (( ~~When~~))  If  a lot does not abut an alley and abuts more than one (( ~~(1)~~)) right-of-way, the location of access (( ~~shall be~~))  is  determined by the Director as a Type I decision after consulting with the Director of Transportation. Unless the Director otherwise determines under subsection  23.49.019. H . 1 . c, access (( ~~shall be~~))  is  allowed only from a right-of-way in the category, determined by the classifications shown on Map 1B and Map 1F  or another map identified in a note to Map 1F , that is most preferred among the categories of rights-of-way abutting the lot, according to the ranking set forth below, from most to least preferred (a portion of a street that is included in more than one (( ~~of the categories in subsections i - vii below shall b~~e))  category is considered as belonging only to the least preferred of the categories in which it is included):

 Section 15. Section 23.49.020 of the Seattle Municipal Code, which section was last amended by Ordinance 122611, is amended as follows:

 23.49.020 Demonstration of LEED Silver rating((~~.~~))

 A. Applicability. This section applies ((~~whenever~~))  if  a commitment to earn a LEED Silver rating or substantially equivalent standard is a condition of a permit.

 B. The Director is authorized to determine, as a Type I decision, whether the applicant has demonstrated that a new structure has earned a LEED Silver rating or met a substantially equivalent standard. The Director may establish by rule procedures for determining whether an applicant has demonstrated that a new structure has earned a LEED Silver rating or met any such substantially equivalent standard, provided that no rule shall assign authority for making a final determination to any person other than an officer of the Department of Planning and Development or another City agency with regulatory authority and expertise in green building practices.

 (( ~~B~~)) C . Demonstration of Compliance; Penalties.

 1. The applicant shall demonstrate to the Director the extent to which the applicant has complied with the commitment to earn a LEED Silver rating no later than (( ~~ninety (90)~~))  90  days after issuance of final Certificate of Occupancy for the new structure, or such later date as may be allowed by the Director for good cause, by submitting a report analyzing the extent credits  were  earned toward such rating from the U.S. Green Building Council or another independent entity approved by the Director. For purposes of this (( ~~section~~))  Section 23.49.020 , if the Director shall have approved a commitment to achieve a substantially equivalent standard, the term "LEED Silver rating" shall mean such other standard.

 2. Failure to submit a timely report regarding a LEED Silver rating from an approved independent entity by the date required is a violation of the Land Use Code. The penalty for such violation (( ~~shall be Five Hundred Dollars ($500)~~))  is $500  per day from the date (( ~~when~~))  that the report was due to the date it is submitted, without any requirement of notice to the applicant.

 3. Failure to demonstrate, through an independent report as provided in this subsection, full compliance with the applicant's commitment to earn a LEED Silver rating, is a violation of the Land Use Code. The penalty for each violation is an amount determined as follows:

 P = [(LSM-CE)/LSM] x CV x 0.0075,

 where:

 P is the penalty;

 LSM is the minimum number of credits to earn a LEED Silver rating;

 CE is the number of credits earned as documented by the report; and

 CV is the Construction Value as set forth on the building permit for the new structure.

 Example:

<table><tr><td>Construction Value

</td><td>$200,000,000.00

</td></tr>

<tr><td>Minimum LEED Credits for Silver rating

</td><td>33

</td></tr>

<tr><td>Credits Earned

</td><td>32

</td></tr>

<tr><td>Penalty = [(33-32)/33] x 200,000,000 x .0075 =

</td><td>$45,454.55

</td></tr>

</table> 4. Failure to comply with the applicant's commitment to earn a LEED Silver rating is a violation of the Land Use Code independent of the failure to demonstrate compliance; however, such violation shall not affect the right to occupy any chargeable floor area, and if a penalty is paid in the amount determined under subsection  23.49.020.C.3  (( ~~B3 of this section~~)), no additional penalty shall be imposed for the failure to comply with the commitment.

 5. If the Director determines that the report submitted provides satisfactory evidence that the applicant's commitment is satisfied, the Director shall issue a certificate to the applicant so stating. If the Director determines that the applicant did not demonstrate compliance with its commitment to earn a LEED Silver rating in accordance with this section, the Director may give notice of such determination, and of the calculation of the penalty due, to the applicant.

 6. If, within (( ~~ninety (90)~~))  90  days, or such longer period as the Director may allow for good cause, after initial notice from the Director of a penalty due under this subsection  23.49.020.C , the applicant shall demonstrate, through a supplemental report from the independent entity that provided the initial report, that it has made sufficient alterations or improvements to earn a LEED Silver rating, or to earn more credits toward such a rating, then the penalty owing shall be eliminated or recalculated accordingly. The amount of the penalty as so re - determined shall be final. If the applicant does not submit a supplemental report in accordance with this subsection  23.49.020.C  by the date required under this subsection  23.49.020.C , then the amount of the penalty as set forth in the Director's original notice shall be final.

 7. Any owner, other than the applicant, of any lot on which the bonus development was obtained or any part thereof, shall be jointly and severally responsible for compliance and liable for any penalty due under this subsection  23.49.020.C .

 (( ~~C~~)) D . Use of Penalties. A subfund shall be established in the City's General Fund to receive revenue from penalties under subsection (( ~~B of this section~~)) 23.49.020.C . Revenue from penalties under that subsection shall be allocated to activities or incentives to encourage and promote the development of sustainable buildings. The Director shall recommend to the Mayor and City Council how these funds should be allocated.

 Section 16. Subsection A of Section 23.49.022 of the Seattle Municipal Code, which section was last amended by Ordinance 118409, is amended as follows:

 23.49.022 Minimum sidewalk and alley width.

 A. (( ~~Except in PMM, PSM, IDM, and IDR zones, minimum~~))  Minimum  sidewalk widths are established for certain streets by Map 1C. (( ~~When~~))

 1. If  a new structure is proposed on lots abutting these streets, sidewalks shall be widened, if necessary, to meet the minimum standard. The sidewalk may be widened into the right-of-way if approved by the Director of Transportation.

 2. Sidewalk widths for certain streets within PMM, PSM, IDM, and IDR zones are addressed by Special Review or Historic District regulations. On a street within the International Special Review District for which a sidewalk width is designated on Map 1C, the minimum sidewalk width identified by Map 1C may be reduced if it is determined that a reduced sidewalk width would better meet the goals and objectives of the International Special Review District identified in Section 23.66.302. Final approval for the reduced sidewalk width will be made by the Director of Transportation upon recommendation by the Director of Neighborhoods.

 * * *

If such commitment is made, Section 23.49.020 applies.

 G. Extra floor area for hotel use in IDM 75/85-150. In a mixed use development that includes residential use and hotel use in an IDM 75/85-150 zone, extra floor area for hotel use above base height limits may be gained under this Section 23.49.023 on the same terms and conditions as extra residential floor area if the structure otherwise qualifies to exceed base height limits under subsection 23.49.208.E. If extra residential floor area is gained for the same development, it shall be combined with any such extra floor area in hotel use for all purposes under this Section 23.49.023 and under Chapter 23.58A.

 2. No building or structure has been demolished or removed from the lot within the ten years immediately preceding application for a building permit for the structure or addition that would exceed an applicable base height limit unless the Director of Neighborhoods determines that the demolished or removed building or structure did not contribute to the architectural or historic character of the Pioneer Square Preservation District;

 3. No portion of the structure has been determined to be "contributing" pursuant to Section 23.66.032, except that additional height for contributing structures is permitted if the applicant can demonstrate, to the satisfaction of the Director of Neighborhoods, that the proposed height is no greater than the maximum height to which the contributing structure was built.

 4. The gross floor area of the portion of the structure in residential use will equal or exceed the gross floor area in the portion of the structure above 100 feet;

 5. The structure will use extra residential floor area available under Section 23.49.023 to gain all additional floor area above the base height limit for residential uses; and

 Section 38. Subsection A of Section 23.49.081 of the Seattle Municipal Code, which section was enacted by Ordinance 123034, is amended as follows:

 23.49.181 Bonus floor area for affordable housing in the PSM 85-120 zone

 A. Purpose; Scope of provisions; State law controlling. This (( ~~section~~))  Section 23.49.181  establishes an affordable housing incentive program for development on lots zoned PSM 85-120 that are subject to FAR limits pursuant to the provisions of Section 23.49.180. Chargeable floor area in addition to the base FAR is allowed for development that includes residential use, to the extent that the applicant qualifies by providing low- income housing (( ~~as part of the development~~)), in accordance with this (( ~~section~~))  Section 23.49.181  and subject to the provisions of (( ~~section~~))  Section  23.49.180. In case of any irreconcilable conflict between the terms of this (( ~~section~~))  Section 23.49.181  and the authority granted in RCW 36.70A.540, as it may be amended, the provisions of RCW 36.70A.540, as it may be amended, shall supersede and control. Unless the context otherwise clearly requires, references to RCW 36.70A.540 in this (( ~~section~~))  Section 23.49.181  mean that section in effect on the date as of which the provisions of this (( ~~title~~))  Title 23  apply to the application for a use permit for the project using the bonus floor area.

 B. Permitting Conditions

 1. Master Use Permit. The Master Use Permit application to establish any bonus floor area under this (( ~~section~~))  Section 23.49.181  shall include a calculation of the total amount of bonus floor area sought and shall identify the quantity and type of affordable housing to be provided to satisfy the conditions to such bonus floor area. The application shall include the proposed location of the affordable housing(( ~~, including~~))  . If any of the affordable housing is proposed to be within the area defined on Map A for Section 23.49.180 where additional height is permitted, the application shall include the location (( ~~or~~)) of the affordable housing within that area and its distribution within the proposed building(s). If any of the affordable housing is not to be provided within the area defined on Map A for Section 23.49.180 where additional height is  permitted, the application shall include the address, legal description, dimensions and ownership of the other lot(s), and the approval of the Director of Housing for the affordable housing to be provided on the other lot(s), pursuant to subsection 23.49.181.E.3. The Director shall, at the time of issuance of any Master Use Permit decision approving any bonus floor area, issue a Type I decision as to the amount of bonus floor area to be allowed and the conditions to such bonus floor area. A declaration signed by the applicant and any other owners of the lot  (s) on which the project using the bonus floor area is to be built and any other owners of the lot(s) where the affordable housing will be located , on a form approved by the Director, specifying the amount of bonus floor area(( ~~and the~~))  , the legal descriptions of the lot where the bonus floor area will be used and each other lot where affordable housing will be located, and the conditions, must be executed and recorded as a condition to issuance of the Master Use Permit for a development to include bonus floor area. (( ~~The declaration may be amended, with the written approval of the Director, if~~))  If  a change in the total bonus floor area to be developed  , or a change in the location of the affordable housing approved by the Director of Housing pursuant to subsection 23.49.181.E.3, results in adjustment to one or more conditions,  the declaration and any related conditions of the Master Use Permit  may be amended, with the written approval of the Director, as a Type I decision. In requesting amendment of a declaration under this subsection 23.49.181.B and any related conditions of the Master Use Permit, the applicant may elect, consistent with subsection 23.76.026.F, that the provisions of this Section 23.49.181 as in effect on the date of the Director's action on that request, rather than any earlier date applicable under Section 23.76.026, apply for purposes of the amendment to the Master Use Permit.

 2. First Building Permit.

 a. Prior to issuance, and as a condition to issuance, of the first building permit for a structure using bonus floor area, the owner of (( ~~the portion of the~~))  each  lot that will include the affordable housing for that bonus floor area shall execute and record an agreement in a form acceptable to the Director of Housing that shall commit to provide that affordable housing, and shall run with the land to bind successors. The applicant shall submit an acceptable agreement, fully signed, as part of the building permit application, and if there is any change in ownership  or if the location at which any affordable housing is to be provided is modified pursuant to subsection 23.49.181.B.1  prior to the issuance of the building permit, the new owners or any other owners of the lot(s) where the affordable housing is to be provided, or both, as applicable, shall execute the agreement or an addendum(( ~~or~~)), substitute  or separate agreement, acceptable to the Director of Housing.

 b. If the affordable housing is to be located on any lot(s) not owned by the applicant, then the applicant shall demonstrate that the applicant is providing the affordable housing on the other lot(s) in connection with the applicant's project, as set forth below in this subsection 23.49.181.B.2.b. Prior to issuance, and as a condition to issuance, of the first building permit for a structure using bonus floor area, the applicant shall provide to the Director of Housing a copy of a signed and binding linkage agreement with the owner(s) of those lots, acceptable to the Director of Housing, pursuant to which only the applicant has the right to claim such housing for purposes of bonus development under this Section 23.49.181 or any other bonus or benefit under this Title 23, and shall demonstrate that the applicant has made a financial contribution to the affordable housing, or has promised such contribution in that linkage agreement and has provided to the City an irrevocable, unconditional letter of credit to ensure its payment, in form and content satisfactory to the Director of Housing, in either case in an amount determined by the Director of Housing to be, when reduced by the value of any expected benefits to be received for such contribution other than the bonus development  , approximately equal to the subsidy gap  for construction in South Downtown of at least the minimum amount of affordable housing determined under this Section 23.49.181 for the amount of bonus floor area sought by the applicant. The Director of Housing may require that one or more parties to a linkage agreement enter into an agreement with the City to establish performance criteria to be met in the development of the affordable housing, to provide for control of the financial contribution from the applicant to ensure its use for the affordable housing, and to provide for its use for alternative affordable housing if performance criteria are not met.

 3. Effect of Certification by Director of Housing. If the Director of Housing certifies to the Director that either (a) the applicant has provided the City with (i) a satisfactory linkage agreement; (ii) evidence of a sufficient financial contribution, a letter of credit, or other sufficient security pursuant to subsection 23.49.181.B.2.b; and (iii) such other agreements as the Director of Housing requires pursuant to subsection 23.49.181.B.2.b, all sufficient for purposes of providing a specified amount of affordable housing consistent with this Section 23.49.181; or (b) there have been recorded one or more agreements or instruments satisfactory to the Director of Housing providing for occupancy and affordability restrictions on affordable housing with the minimum floor area determined under this Section 23.49.181 for the amount of bonus floor area sought by the applicant, all affordable housing has been completed, and the affordable housing either is on a different lot from the bonus floor area or is located in one or more condominium units separate from the bonus floor area under condominium documents acceptable to the Director of Housing; then any failure of the affordable housing to be completed or to satisfy the requirements of subsection 23.49.181.E shall not affect the right to maintain or occupy the bonus floor area and shall not cause the applicant or owner of the lot with the bonus floor area to be in violation of this Title 23.

 C. Findings. Pursuant to the authority of RCW 36.70A.540, the City finds that the higher income levels specified in  the definition of "income-eligible households" in this (( ~~section~~))  Section 23.49.181 , rather than those stated in the definition of "low- income households" in RCW 36.70A.540, are needed to address local housing market conditions in the area to which this (( ~~section~~))  Section 23.49.181  applies.

 D. Defined Terms. For purposes of this (( ~~section~~))  Section 23.49.181 :

 1. "Affordable housing" means a unit or units of low-income housing provided as a condition to bonus floor area.

 2. "Base FAR" or "base floor area ratio" means a FAR of 4.

 3. "Bonus floor area" means all chargeable floor area allowed in addition to the base FAR.

 4. "Income-eligible households" means:

 a. In the case of rental housing, households with incomes no higher than 80 percent of median income as defined in Section 23.84A.025.

 b. In the case of owner occupancy housing units, households with incomes no higher than the median income as defined in Section 23.84A.025.

 5. "Low-income housing" means housing that serves income- eligible households as determined in subsection 23.49.181.E .

 6. "Net bonus floor area" means gross square footage of bonus floor area, multiplied by an efficiency factor of 80 percent.

 E. Affordable Housing

 2. Serving income-eligible households. For the purposes of this (( ~~section~~))  Section 23.49.181 , a housing unit serves income-eligible households only if either:

 a. For a period of 50 years beginning upon the issuance of a final certificate of occupancy by the Department of Planning and Development for a structure using the bonus floor area for which that affordable housing is provided, the housing is used as rental housing solely for income-eligible households at rent limited so that annual housing costs, including rent and basic utilities, do not exceed 30 percent of 80 percent of median income, and the housing unit and the structure in which it is located are maintained in decent and habitable condition, including basic appliances in the housing unit; or

 b. The unit is sold for owner-occupancy to an income-eligible household at an initial sale price limited so that the annual housing costs, including mortgage principal and interest, real estate taxes, insurance, plus homeowner dues if applicable, are not expected to exceed 35 percent of median income, according to a calculation based on reasonable assumptions and approved by the Director of Housing, and the unit is subject to a recorded instrument satisfactory to the Director of Housing with a term extending until 50 years after the issuance of a final certificate of occupancy by the Department of Planning and Development for the structure using the bonus floor area for which that affordable housing is provided, providing for sales prices on any resale consistent with affordability on the same basis as the initial sale, allowing resales only to income-eligible households, and requiring that upon any resale, the housing unit be in decent and habitable condition, including adequate basic appliances in the housing unit.

 3. Location, size and other requirements. Affordable housing (( ~~shall~~))  may  be provided  within the area defined on Map A for Section 23.49.180 where additional height is permitted  (( ~~on the same lot as the project using the bonus floor area~~))  . Alternatively, affordable housing may be provided on one or more different lots within South Downtown, subject to approval by the Director of Housing under the criteria in this subsection 23.49.181.E and to the conditions in subsection 23.49.181.B.2. Approval requires a determination by the Director of Housing that the affordable housing will (a) provide a public benefit; and (b) be more affordable than market rents or sale prices, as applicable, for housing in South Downtown. The affordable housing shall be provided in a range of unit sizes consistent with RCW 36.70A.540(( ~~. The affordable housing shall~~))  and  comply with all requirements of RCW 36.70A.540.

 4. Time of completion.  Unless affordable housing is to be provided on a lot other than that of the project using the bonus and the Director of Housing has made all approvals described in subsection 23.49.181.B.2 and 23.49.181.E.3, (( ~~The~~))  the  affordable housing shall be completed and ready for occupancy at or before the time when a certificate of occupancy is issued for any bonus floor area that is based on the affordable housing and as a condition to any right of the applicant to such a certificate of occupancy.

 5. No Subsidies for affordable housing; exceptions.

 a. In general, and except as may be otherwise required by applicable federal or state law, no bonus floor area may be earned by providing affordable housing if:

 2) The housing is or would be, independent of the requirements for the bonus floor area, subject to any restrictions on the income of occupants, rents or sale prices.

 b. As exceptions to the general rule in subsection 23.49.181.E.5.a:

 1)  All  (( ~~Affordable~~))  affordable  housing provided as a condition to bonus floor area (( ~~may~~))  within the area defined on Map A for Section 23.49.180 where additional height is permitted may consist wholly or in part of the same units used to satisfy terms under which the lot or a portion thereof was transferred by a public body  , and up to seventy units of affordable housing provided as a condition to bonus floor area on a lot outside the area defined on Map A for Section 23.49.180 where additional height is permitted, may consist wholly or in part of the same units used to satisfy terms under which the lot or a portion thereof was transferred by a public body ;

 2) The improvements on the lot may qualify for, and affordable housing provided as a condition to bonus floor area may consist wholly or in part of the same units used to satisfy conditions of, property tax exemptions pursuant to Chapter 5.73 SMC; and

 3) The prohibition on public subsidies for affordable housing does not include Internal Revenue Code Section 45D, New Markets Tax Credits.

 c. The Director of Housing may require, as a condition of any bonus floor area, that the owner of the lot upon which the affordable housing is located agree not to seek or accept any subsidies, other than as described in subsection 23.49.181.E.5.b, related to housing. The Director of Housing may require that such agreement provide for the payment to the City, for deposit in an appropriate sub-fund or account, of the value of any subsidies received in excess of any amounts allowed by such agreement.

 d. As an exception to the restriction on subsidies, the Director of Housing may allow the building or buildings in which the affordable housing is located to be financed in part with subsidies based on determinations that:

 1) the total amount of affordable housing is at least 300 net residential square feet greater than the minimum amount of affordable housing that would be needed to satisfy the conditions of this (( ~~section~~))  Section 23.49.181 ;

 2) the public benefit of the affordable housing net of those subsidies, as measured through an economic analysis, exceeds the public benefit from the minimum amount of affordable housing; and

 F. Identification of bonus floor area. The floor area that constitutes bonus floor area under this (( ~~section~~))  Section 23.49.181  shall be determined according to the order in which Master Use Permits are issued to establish the chargeable floor area, with the base FAR allocable to the earlier Master Use Permits. Within a structure or structures developed under a single Master Use Permit that involves both base floor area and bonus floor area:

 2. If  the complete applications for building permits for construction, not including any permits limited to excavation and shoring, are submitted at the same time, then unless otherwise specifically identified in the Master Use Permit application and approved by the Director, the bonus floor area shall be the chargeable floor area, excluding any affordable housing, in the highest stories in the structure or structures, and if only a portion of a story consists of bonus floor area, it shall be allocated to each portion of that story in proportion to its chargeable floor area, excluding any affordable housing, within that story.

 G. Obligation of Owners.

 1. Except as otherwise expressly provided in subsection 23.49.181.B.3, any  owner of bonus floor area shall be in violation of this (( ~~title~~))  Title 23  if:

For any structure greater than 150 feet in height excluding rooftop features, gross floor area of any story that is eligible for coverage limit averaging under Table B for 23.49.242 or Table C for 23.49.242 shall not exceed 35 percent of the lot area, unless the average gross floor area of all stories eligible for averaging is no more than 9,000 square feet per story; and in any case no single story above a height of 85 feet shall exceed a gross floor area of 11,500 square feet. For purposes of this subsection 23.49.242.C.5, gross floor area for any story of less than 4,000 square feet is assigned a value of 4,000 square feet for the purpose of calculating average floor area.

 D. Setbacks.

 1. The following minimum setbacks are required for structures on lots abutting a green street designated on Map 1F or another map identified in a note to Map 1F:

 a. In an IDR zone, a continuous upper-level setback of 15 feet is required from the green street lot line for all portions of the structure above 45 feet in height. This setback is not required if a structure is 65 feet in height or less, except on Maynard Avenue S. b. In an IDR/C zone, a continuous setback of 6 feet is required at street level from the green street lot line. For a structure exceeding 85 feet in height, a continuous upper-level setback of 16 feet is required from the green street lot line for all portions of the structure above a height of 65 feet.

 2. For a structure exceeding 85 feet in height, a continuous upper-level setback of 15 feet is required from each side lot line that is not a street or alley lot line for all portions of the structure above a height of 65 feet.

 E. Facade modulation.

 1. For structures 150 feet or less in height excluding rooftop features, modulation is required for the portion of a street-facing facade above 65 feet in height and located less than 15 feet from street lot lines. No modulation is required for portions of a facade set back 15 feet or more from street lot lines.

 2. For structures exceeding 150 feet in height, modulation is required for the portion of a street-facing facade in non- residential use between 65 feet and 125 feet in height and located less than 15 feet from street lot lines. No modulation is required for portions of a facade set back 15 feet or more from street lot lines.

 3. For portions of structures subject to the modulation requirements of this subsection 23.49.242.E, the maximum length of a street-facing facade without modulation is prescribed in Table D for 23.49.242. For purposes of this subsection 23.49.242.E, length is measured parallel to each street lot line and includes projections from the street- facing facade, such as balconies.

 B. Standards for Sending Lots  in the South Lake Union Urban Center .

 1.  This subsection 23.50.053.B applies to sending lots in the South Lake Union Urban Center. Eligibility as a sending lot for a type of TDR is specified by zone in Table A for 23.50.053.

 a. The maximum amount of floor area that may be transferred from a sending lot in the South Lake Union Urban Center is the amount by which the product of the eligible lot area times the base FAR of the sending lot exceeds the sum of any chargeable floor area on the lot plus any TDR previously transferred from the sending lot.

 b. For purposes of this subsection

 23.50.053.

 B

 .

 1, the eligible lot area is the total area of the sending lot, reduced by the excess, if any, of the total of accessory surface

 parking over one-quarter (( ~~(1/4)~~)) of the total area of the footprints of all structures on the sending lot.

 2. (( ~~When~~))  If  TDR are transferred from a sending lot in a zone with a FAR limit that applies to nonresidential uses, the amount of chargeable floor area that may then be built on the sending lot shall be equal to the area of the lot multiplied by the base FAR, minus the total of:

 a. The chargeable floor area on the lot; plus

 b. The amount of chargeable floor area transferred from the lot.

 3. Chargeable floor area allowed above the base FAR under any provisions of this (( ~~title~~))  Title 23 , or allowed under any exceptions or waivers of development standards, may not be transferred. TDR may be transferred from a lot that contains chargeable floor area exceeding the base FAR only to the extent, if any, that:

 a. TDR were previously transferred to such lot in compliance with the Land Use Code provisions and applicable rules then in effect;

 b. Those TDR, together with the base FAR set forth in (( ~~Section~~))  subsection  23.48.016 . B or in Section 23.50.028, exceed the chargeable floor area on the lot and any additional chargeable floor area for which any permit has been issued or for which any permit application is pending; and

 c. The excess amount of TDR previously transferred to such lot would have been eligible for transfer from the original sending lot under (( ~~the provisions of~~)) this (( ~~section~~))  Section 23.50.053  at the time of their original transfer from that lot.

 (( ~~6.~~))  4.  Landmark structures on sending lots from which Landmark TDR are transferred shall be restored and maintained as required by the Landmarks Preservation Board.

 (( ~~7.~~))  5.  Housing on lots from which housing TDR are transferred shall be rehabilitated to the extent required to provide decent, sanitary and habitable conditions, in compliance with applicable codes, and so as to have an estimated minimum useful life of at least(( ~~fifty (50)~~))  50  years from the time of the TDR transfer, as approved by the Director of Housing. If housing TDR are proposed to be transferred prior to the completion of work necessary to satisfy this subsection (( ~~B7~~))  23.50.053.B.5 , the Director (( ~~of the Office~~)) of Housing may require, as a condition to such transfer, that security be deposited with the City to ensure the completion of such work.

 (( ~~8.~~))  6.  The housing units on a lot from which housing TDR are transferred, and that are committed to low-income housing as a condition to eligibility of the lot as a TDR sending site, shall be generally comparable in their average size and quality of construction to other housing units in the same structure, in the judgment of the (( ~~Housing~~)) Director  of Housing , after completion of any rehabilitation or construction undertaken in order to qualify as a TDR sending lot.

 (( ~~9.~~))  7.  Structures on an arts facility TDR site shall be built or rehabilitated to the extent required to be in compliance with applicable codes, and so as to have an estimated minimum useful life of at least (( ~~fifty (50)~~))  50  years from the time of the TDR transfer.

 C.  General standards for the transfer of development rights to lots in an IC 85-160 zone outside the South Lake Union Urban Center.

 1. To achieve extra nonresidential floor area above the base FAR that may be allowed in an IC 85-160 zone pursuant to subsection 23.50.028.D, an applicant may use TDR to the extent permitted under this subsection 23.50.053.C.

 2. South Downtown Historic TDR, open space TDR from zones within South Downtown, and housing TDR eligible to be transferred from a lot under Section 23.49.014 may be transferred from a Downtown zone to a lot eligible as a receiving site in an IC 85-160 zone. No other TDR may be used in an IC 85-160 zone under this Section 23.50.053.

 3. Except as expressly permitted pursuant to subsection 23.50.053.C, development rights or potential floor area may not be transferred to a lot in an IC 85-160 zone.

 4. No permit after the first building permit, and in any event, no permit for any construction activity other than excavation and shoring or for occupancy of existing floor area by any use based upon TDR, will be issued for development that includes TDR until the applicant's possession of TDR is demonstrated to the satisfaction of the Director.

 D.  Limit on within-block TDR. Any receiving lot may use TDR from sending lots that are eligible to send TDR solely because they are on the same block as the receiving lot for a maximum of (( ~~fifteen (15)~~))  15  percent of all floor area gained through bonus and TDR on the receiving lot.

 (( ~~D~~)) E . Transfer of Development Rights Deeds and Agreements.  This subsection 23.50.053.E applies to sending lots in IC zones, and to the use of TDR on receiving lots in IC zones regardless of whether the TDR are from a sending lot in an IC zone.

 1. The fee owners of the sending lot shall execute a deed, and shall obtain the release of the TDR from all liens of record and the written consent of all holders of encumbrances on the sending lot other than easements and restrictions, unless such release or consent is waived by the Director for good cause. The deed shall be recorded in the King County real property records. (( ~~When~~))  If  TDR are conveyed to the owner of a receiving lot described in the deed, then unless otherwise expressly stated in the deed or any subsequent instrument conveying such lot or the TDR, the TDR shall pass with the receiving lot whether or not a structure using such TDR shall have been permitted or built prior to any conveyance of the receiving lot. Any subsequent conveyance of TDR previously conveyed to a receiving lot shall require the written consent of all parties holding any interest in or lien on the receiving lot from which the conveyance is made. If the TDR are transferred other than directly from the sending lot to the receiving lot using the TDR, then after the initial transfer, all subsequent transfers also shall be by deed, duly executed, acknowledged and recorded, each referring by King County recording number to the prior deed.

 2. Any person may purchase any TDR that are eligible for transfer by complying with the applicable provisions of this (( ~~section~~))  Section 23.50.053 , whether or not the purchaser is then an applicant for a permit to develop real property. Any purchaser of such TDR (including any successor or assignee) may use such TDR to obtain floor area above the applicable base on a receiving lot to the extent such use of TDR is permitted under the Land Use Code provisions in effect on the date of vesting, under applicable law, of such person's rights with respect to the issuance of permits for development of the project intended to use such TDR. The Director may require, as a condition of processing any permit application using TDR or for the release of any security posted in lieu of a deed for TDR to the receiving lot, that the owner of the receiving lot demonstrate that the TDR have been validly transferred of record to the receiving lot, and that such owner has recorded in the real estate records a notice of the filing of such permit application, stating that such TDR are not available for retransfer.

 3. For transfers of Landmark TDR, the owner of the sending lot shall execute and record an agreement in form and content acceptable to the Landmarks Preservation Board providing for the restoration and maintenance of the historically significant features of the structure or structures on the lot.

 4. For transfers of arts facility TDR from an arts facility TDR site, the owner of the sending lot shall execute and record an agreement in form and content acceptable to the Director of the Office of Arts and Cultural Affairs providing for the construction, improvement and/or maintenance of structure(s) on the lot and the use of the arts facility sending site for at least (( ~~fifty (50)~~))  50  years by one or more non-profit organizations dedicated to the creation, display, performance or screening of art by or for members of the general public. Such agreements shall commit to improvements, maintenance, limits on occupancy and other measures to maintain the long- term use of the structure(s) for artistic activities consistent with the definition of arts facility TDR site and acceptable to the Director of the Office of Arts and Cultural Affairs.

 5. For transfers of housing TDR, the owner of the sending lot shall execute and record an agreement, with the written consent of all holders of encumbrances on the sending lot, unless such consent is waived by the Director of the Office of Housing for good cause, to provide for the maintenance of the required housing on the sending lot for a minimum of (( ~~fifty (50)~~))  50  years. Such agreement shall commit to limits on rent and occupancy consistent with the definition of housing TDR site and acceptable to the Director of (( ~~the Office of~~)) Housing.

 6. A deed conveying TDR may require or permit the return of the TDR to the sending lot under specified conditions, but notwithstanding any such provisions:

 a. The transfer of TDR to a receiving lot shall remain effective so long as any portion of any structure for which a permit was issued based upon such transfer remains on the receiving lot; and

 b. The City shall not be required to recognize any return of TDR unless it is demonstrated that all parties in the chain of title have executed, acknowledged and recorded instruments conveying any interest in the TDR back to the sending lot and any lien holders have released any liens thereon.

 7. Any agreement governing the use or development of the sending lot shall provide that its covenants or conditions shall run with the land and shall be specifically enforceable by The City of Seattle.

 (( ~~E~~)) F . Time of Determination of TDR Eligible for Transfer. The eligibility of a sending lot to transfer TDR, and the amount transferable from a sending lot, shall be determined as of the date of transfer from the sending lot and shall not be affected by the date of any application, permit decision or other action for any project seeking to use such TDR.

 (( ~~F~~)) G . Use of Previously Transferred TDR by New Projects. Any project using TDR according to applicable limits on TDR in Sections 23.50.051 and 23.50.053 may use TDR that were transferred from the sending lot consistent with the provisions of this (( ~~title~~))  Title 23  in effect at the time of such transfer.

 H. Rules. The Director may promulgate rules to implement this Section 23.50.053.

 Section 65. A new Section 23.50.055 of the Seattle Municipal Code is added as follows:

 The following development standards apply to all lots within an IC 85-160 zone.

 A. Street-facing facade requirements. For purposes of this Section 23.50.055, balcony railings and other non-structural features or non-structural walls are not considered parts of the facade.

 1. Minimum facade height. A minimum facade height of 25 feet is required for facades that face streets shown on Map A for 23.50.016, Industrial Streets Landscaping Plan. The minimum facade height for facades facing other streets is 15 feet. A minimum facade height does not apply if all portions of a structure are lower than the applicable minimum facade height.

 2. Facade setback limits. The total area of street-level setbacks between the street lot line and the street-facing facade is limited to the area determined by multiplying the averaging factor by the width of the structure measured parallel to the abutting street.

 a. The averaging factor is five for facades that face streets shown on Map A for 23.50.016.

 b. For all other street-facing facades, the averaging factor is ten.

 c. The maximum width, measured along the street lot line, of any setback area exceeding a depth of 15 feet from the street lot line is 80 feet, or 30 percent of the lot frontage on that street, whichever is less.

 d. For all lots subject to facade setback limits, the following conditions apply:

 1) Parking is prohibited between the facade and the street lot line.

 2) The maximum setback of the facade from street lot lines within 20 feet of an intersection is 10 feet.

 e. If the presence of a utility easement or other condition requires the street-facing facade to set back from the street lot line, the Director may, as a Type I decision, select another line to apply the standards of subsection 23.50.055.A.2. If sidewalk widening into the lot is required as mitigation pursuant to subsection 23.50.028.D, the setback area permitted by the applicable averaging factor shall be measured from the new edge of the sidewalk within the lot rather than the street lot line.

 3. Principal pedestrian entrances. A principal pedestrian entrance to a structure is required on facades facing streets shown on Map A for 23.50.016, Industrial Streets Landscaping Plan.

 4. Facade transparency requirements. Facade transparency requirements apply to the area of the facade between 2 feet and 8 feet above the sidewalk. Only clear or lightly tinted glass in windows, doors, and display windows is considered to be transparent. Transparent areas shall allow views into the structure or into display windows from the outside.

 a. For facades facing a street shown on Map A for 23.50.016, Industrial Streets Landscaping Plan, a minimum of 60 percent of a street-facing facade shall be transparent.

 b. For facades facing all other streets, a minimum of 40 percent of the street-facing facade shall be transparent.

 B. Upper Level Development Standards.

 1. Facade Modulation.

 a. For structures exceeding 85 feet in height, modulation is required for the portion of a street-facing facade above 65 feet in height if any part of the facade above that height is located less than 15 feet from street lot lines. No modulation is required for portions of a facade set back 15 feet or more from street lot lines.

 b. For portions of structures subject to the modulation requirements of subsection 23.50.055.B, the maximum length of a street-facing facade without modulation is prescribed in Table A for 23.50.055. For purposes of this subsection 23.50.055.B, length is measured parallel to each street lot line, and includes projections from the street-facing facade, such as balconies, within 15 feet of street lot lines or their projection.

 d. South Downtown Historic TDP shall not be transferred from a lot from which South Downtown Historic TDR have been transferred or from a lot on which any bonus floor area has been established based on the presence of a contributing structure.

 3. Limit on Combined TDR and TDP. A cumulative combination of TDR and TDP exceeding a total of six times the lot area may not be transferred from any lot.

 G.  Time of Determination of TDP Eligible for Transfer. The eligibility of a sending lot to transfer TDP, and the amount transferable from a sending lot, shall be determined as of the date of transfer from the sending lot and shall not be affected by the date of any application, permit decision or other action for any project seeking to use the TDP.

 ((~~G~~)) H . Reservation in Deed. Any TDP eligible for transfer may instead be reserved in the conveyance of title to an eligible sending lot, by the express terms of the deed or other instrument of conveyance reserving a specified amount of TDP, provided that an instrument acceptable to the Director is recorded binding the lot to the terms and conditions for eligibility to send TDP under this ((~~section~~)) Section  23.58A.018. Any TDP so reserved shall be considered transferred from that lot and later may be conveyed by deed without participation of the owner of the lot.

 ((~~H~~)) I . TDP Deeds and Agreements.

 1. The fee owners of the sending lot shall execute a deed, and shall obtain the release of the TDP from all liens of record and the written consent of all holders of encumbrances on the sending lot other than easements and restrictions, unless the requirement for a release or consent is waived by the Director for good cause. The deed shall be recorded in the King County real property records. ((~~When~~))  If  TDP is conveyed to the owner of a receiving lot described in the deed, then unless otherwise expressly stated in the deed or any subsequent instrument conveying the lot or the TDP, the TDP shall pass with the receiving lot whether or not a structure using the TDP shall have been permitted or built prior to any conveyance of the receiving lot. Any subsequent conveyance of TDP previously conveyed to a receiving lot shall require the written consent of all parties holding any interest in or lien on the receiving lot from which the conveyance is made. If the TDP is transferred other than directly from the sending lot to the receiving lot using the TDP, then after the initial transfer, all subsequent transfers also shall be by deed, duly executed, acknowledged and recorded, each referring by King County recording number to the prior deed.

 2. Any person may purchase any TDP that is eligible for transfer by complying with the applicable provisions of this Section 23.58A.018, whether or not the purchaser is then an applicant for a permit to develop real property or is the owner of any potential receiving lot. Any purchaser of the TDP (including any successor or assignee) may use the TDP to obtain floor area above the applicable base height limit or base floor area limit on a receiving lot to the extent that use of TDP is permitted under the Land Use Code provisions applicable with respect to the issuance of permits for development of the project intended to use the TDP. The Director may require, as a condition of processing any permit application using TDP or for the release of any security posted in lieu of a deed for TDP to the receiving lot, that the owner of the receiving lot demonstrate that the TDP has been validly transferred of record to the receiving lot, and that the owner has recorded in the real estate records a notice of the filing of such permit application, stating that the TDP is not available for retransfer.

 3. As a condition to the effective transfer of Landmark TDP or South Downtown Historic  TDP, except from a City-owned sending lot, the fee owner of the sending lot shall execute and record an agreement running with the land, in form and content acceptable to, and accepted in writing by, the Director ((~~of the Department~~)) of Neighborhoods, providing for the rehabilitation and maintenance of the historically significant or other relevant features of the structure or structures on the lot and acknowledging the restrictions on future development resulting from the transfer. The Director may require evidence that each holder of a lien has effectively subordinated the lien to the terms of the agreement, and that any holders of interests in the property have agreed to its terms. To the extent that a Landmark structure on the sending lot, or ((~~an historically significant~~))  a contributing  structure on a sending lot in a special review district, the presence of which is a condition to eligibility to transfer TDP under the provisions of the zone, requires restoration or rehabilitation for the long-term preservation of the structure or its historically or architecturally significant features, the Director ((~~of the Department~~)) of Neighborhoods may require, as a condition to acceptance of the necessary agreement, that the owner of the sending site apply for and obtain a certificate of approval from the Landmarks Preservation Board, or from the ((~~Department~~)) Director  of Neighborhoods((~~Director~~)) after review by the Pioneer Square Preservation Board or International Special Review District Board, as applicable, for the necessary work, or post security satisfactory to the Director of ((~~the Department of~~))Neighborhoods for the completion of the restoration or rehabilitation, or both.

 Section 74. A new Subchapter III is added to Chapter 23.58A of the Seattle Municipal Code, which includes new Sections 23.58A.020, 23.58A.022, 23.58A.023, and 23.58A.024, as follows:

 Subchapter III Extra Nonresidential Floor Area

 23.58A.020 Scope of subchapter

 This subchapter III includes provisions under which applicants may gain extra nonresidential floor area in development for which the applicable provisions of the zone expressly refer to this Chapter 23.58A.

 23.58A.022 Methods to achieve extra nonresidential floor area

 A. All or a percentage of the extra nonresidential floor area on a lot shall be housing and child care bonus nonresidential floor area pursuant to Section 23.58A.024, or housing TDR, or a combination of the foregoing unless otherwise expressly provided in the provisions of the zone.

 B. If the maximum height limit for nonresidential use is 85 feet or less, all extra nonresidential floor area shall be housing and child care bonus nonresidential floor area, or housing TDR, or any combination thereof.

 C. If the maximum height limit for nonresidential use is greater than 85 feet, the applicant shall use housing and child care bonus nonresidential floor area pursuant to Section 23.58A.024, or housing TDR, or any combination thereof, to achieve 75 percent of total extra nonresidential floor area on the lot, and, to the extent permitted under the provisions of the zone and this subchapter, shall use other bonus nonresidential floor area or TDR or both, for the balance of the extra nonresidential floor area.

 23.58A.023 Affordable housing incentive programs: purpose and findings

 A. Purpose; Scope of Provisions; State Law Controlling. The provisions of this Chapter 23.58A related to housing and child care bonus nonresidential floor area, except to the extent they relate to child care, are intended to implement affordable housing incentive programs authorized by RCW 36.70A.540, as it may be amended. In case of any irreconcilable conflict between the terms of this Chapter 23.58A related to the housing bonus and child care bonus nonresidential floor area, except to the extent they relate to child care, and the authority granted in RCW 36.70A.540, as it may be amended, the provisions of RCW 36.70A.540, as it may be amended, shall supersede and control. Unless the context otherwise clearly requires, references to RCW 36.70A.540 in this subchapter mean that section as in effect on the date as of which the provisions of this title apply to the application for a use permit for the project using the bonus floor area.

 B. Findings. Pursuant to the authority of RCW 36.70A.540, the City finds that the higher income levels specified in the definition of "income-eligible households" in Section 23.58A.004, rather than those stated in the definition of "low-income households" in RCW 36.70A.540, are needed to address local housing market conditions throughout the city for purposes of affordable housing incentive programs implemented through this subchapter.

 23.58A.024 Bonus nonresidential floor area for low-income housing and child care

 A. Scope; General Rule. This Section 23.58A.024 applies to bonus nonresidential floor area allowed on lots for which applicable sections of this Title 23 expressly refer to this Chapter 23.58A. Bonus nonresidential floor area may be allowed if the applicant qualifies by using the performance option, the payment option, or a combination of these options, in accordance with this Section 23.58A.024 and subject to the provisions of the zone.

 B. Performance Option.

 1. Housing.

 a. An applicant using the housing performance option shall provide housing serving income-eligible households in an amount equal to 15.6 percent of gross bonus nonresidential floor area obtained under the performance option pursuant to this Section 23.58A.024.

 b. An applicant may provide low-income housing as part of the project using extra floor area or by providing or contributing to a low-income housing project at another location, subject to the requirements in subsection 23.58A.024.B.1.e and subject to approval of the low-income housing project in writing by the Director of Housing prior to issuance of the first building permit for the development using the bonus nonresidential floor area.

 c. The low-income housing shall serve only income-eligible households for a minimum period of 50 years from the later of the date when the agreement between the housing owner and the City, as required by subsection 23.58A.024.B.1.e.3 and described in subsection 23.58A.024.B.1.e, if applicable, is recorded, or the date when the low-income housing becomes available for occupancy as determined by the City. For rental housing, rent shall be limited so that housing costs, including rent and basic utilities, shall not exceed 30 percent of the income limit for income-eligible households, all as determined by the Director of Housing, for a minimum period of 50 years. For owner- occupied housing, the initial sale price shall not exceed an amount determined by the Director of Housing to be consistent with low-income housing for an income-eligible household with the average family size expected to occupy the unit based on the number of bedrooms, and the units shall be subject to recorded instruments satisfactory to the Director of Housing providing for sales prices on any resale consistent with affordability on the same basis for at least 50 years. The low-income housing shall be provided in a range of sizes consistent with RCW 36.70A.540 and shall comply with all requirements of RCW 36.70A.540.

 d. If the low-income housing is developed within the project using the bonus floor area:

 1) The low-income housing must serve income-eligible households for the minimum time period referred to in this Section 23.58A.024.

 2) The low-income housing shall be completed and ready for occupancy at or before the time when a certificate of occupancy is issued for any chargeable floor area in the project using the bonus nonresidential floor area, and as a condition to any right of the applicant to such a certificate of occupancy.

 e. If the low-income housing is not being developed within the project using the bonus nonresidential floor area:

 1) Proposals for low-income housing are subject to approval by the Director of Housing. Approval requires a determination by the Director of Housing that the low-income housing will (a) be located within the same neighborhood where the project using the bonus nonresidential floor area is located, except as otherwise provided in subsection 23.58A.024.B.1.e.2; (b) provide a public benefit; and (c) be more affordable than market rents or sale prices, as applicable, for housing in the neighborhood in which the low-income housing is located.

 2) If the applicant demonstrates to the satisfaction of the Director of Housing that it is infeasible for the off-site low-income housing to be located within the same neighborhood where the development using the bonus nonresidential floor area is located, then (a) the Director of Housing may allow the low-income housing to be provided elsewhere within the Seattle city limits, which is deemed the general area of the development using the bonus nonresidential floor area in accordance with RCW 36.70A.540, provided that the low-income housing is within 0.5 mile of a light rail or bus rapid transit station on a route serving the neighborhood where the development using the bonus nonresidential floor area is located, or (b) if the applicant demonstrates that providing the low-income housing in such a location is also infeasible, then the Director of Housing may allow the low- income housing to be provided in the city within 0.25 mile of a bus or streetcar stop.

 3) The low-income housing must be committed to serve income-eligible households for the minimum time period referred to in this Section 23.58A.024 pursuant to an agreement between the housing owner and the City, and any agreements with other parties that the Director of Housing finds necessary.

 4) The agreement required by subsection 23.58A.024.B.1.e.3 must be executed and recorded prior to issuance, and as a condition to issuance, of the first building permit for the project using the bonus nonresidential floor area, and in any event before any permit for any construction activity other than excavation and shoring is issued.

 5) The applicant shall provide to the City an irrevocable letter of credit, or other sufficient security approved by the Director of Housing, prior to and as a condition of issuance of the first building permit, other than for grading and shoring, for the project using the bonus nonresidential floor area, unless completion of the low-income housing has already been documented to the satisfaction of the Director of Housing and the low-income housing is subject to recorded restrictions satisfactory to the Director of Housing. The letter of credit or other security shall be in an amount equal to the payment option amount calculated according to provisions in subsection 23.58A.024.C, plus an amount equal to interest on such amount, at the rate equal to the prime rate quoted by Bank of America or its successor at the time the letter of credit or other security is provided, plus three percent per annum, from the date of issuance of the first building permit, other than for excavation and shoring, for the project using the bonus nonresidential floor area. The letter of credit or other security shall be on terms such that when a certificate of occupancy is issued for the project using the bonus nonresidential floor area, or on any earlier date 30 days before the letter of credit or other security will expire, if the required quantity of low-income housing is not completed and ready for occupancy or the low-income housing is not all subject to a recorded agreement sufficient to satisfy the terms of this Section 23.58A.024, the City shall have a right to draw on the letter of credit or other security. If and when the City becomes entitled to realize on any such security, the Director of Housing shall take appropriate steps to collect the amount calculated pursuant to the payment option provisions in subsection 23.58A.024.C (after allowing credit for any low-income housing then provided and accepted by the Director of Housing) with interest for the period and at the rate determined pursuant to this subsection 23.58A.024.B.1.e.5, and the amounts realized, net of any costs to the City, shall be used in the same manner as cash payments for housing made under this Section 23.58A.024. To the extent the City receives payment through a letter of credit or other security, the obligation of the applicant to provide low-income housing will be deemed satisfied and the applicant shall be deemed to have elected the payment option. The applicant shall not be entitled to any refund based on later completion of low-income housing.

 6) If the Director of Housing certifies to the Director that either (a) the applicant has provided the City with a letter of credit or other sufficient security pursuant to subsection 23.58A.024.B.1.e.5; or (b) there have been recorded one or more agreements or instruments satisfactory to the Director of Housing providing for occupancy and affordability restrictions on low-income housing with the minimum floor area determined under this Section 23.58A.024, all low-income housing has been completed, and the low-income housing is on a different lot from the bonus nonresidential floor area or is in one or more condominium units separate from the bonus development under condominium documents acceptable to the Director of Housing, then any failure of the low-income housing to satisfy the requirements of this subsection 23.58A.024.B.1 shall not affect the right to maintain or occupy the bonus nonresidential floor area.

 7) Unless and until the Director of Housing shall certify as set forth in clause (a) or (b) of subsection 23.58A.024.B.1.e.6, it shall be a continuing permit condition, whether or not expressly stated, for each project obtaining bonus nonresidential floor area based on the provision of housing to which this Section 23.58A.024 applies, that the low-income housing shall be maintained in compliance with the terms of this Section 23.58A.024 and any applicable provisions of the zone, as documented to the satisfaction of the Director of Housing.

 f. No subsidies for bonused housing; Exception.

 1) The Director of Housing may require, as a condition of any bonus nonresidential floor area under the performance option, that the owner of the lot upon which the low-income housing is located agree not to seek or accept any subsidies, including without limitation those items referred to subsection 23.58A.024.B.1.f.2, related to housing, except for any subsidies that may be allowed by the Director of Housing under that subsection 23.58A.024.B.1.f.2. The Director may require that such agreement provide for the payment to the City, for deposit in an appropriate subfund or account, of the value of any subsidies received in excess of any amounts allowed by such agreement.

 2) In general, and except as may be otherwise required by applicable federal or state law, no bonus nonresidential floor area may be earned by providing housing if:

 a) Any person is receiving or will receive with respect to the housing any charitable contributions or public subsidies for housing development or operation, including, but not limited to, tax exempt bond financing, tax credits, federal loans or grants, City of Seattle housing loans or grants, county housing funds, and State of Washington housing funds; or

 b) The housing is or would be, independent of the requirements for the bonus nonresidential floor area, subject to any restrictions on the income of occupants, rents or sale prices.

 3) For the purpose of this subsection 23.58A.024.B.1.f, the qualification for and use of property tax exemptions pursuant to SMC Chapter 5.73, or any other program implemented pursuant to RCW Chapter 84.14, does not constitute a subsidy, and any related conditions regarding incomes, rent or sale prices do not constitute restrictions.

 4) As an exception to the restriction on subsidies, the Director of Housing may allow the building or buildings in which the low-income housing is located to be financed in part with subsidies based on the determination that (a) the total amount of low-income housing is at least 300 net residential square feet greater than the amount otherwise required through the performance option under this section; (b) the public benefit of the low-income housing net of any subsidies, as measured through an economic analysis, exceeds the amount of the payment-in-lieu that would otherwise be paid; and (c) the subsidies being allowed would not be sufficient to leverage private funds for production of the low-income housing, under restrictions as required for the performance option, without additional City subsidy in an amount greater than the payment-in-lieu amount that would otherwise be paid.

 g. The Director of Housing is authorized to accept and execute agreements and instruments to implement this Section 23.58A.024. Issuance of the certificate of occupancy for the project using the bonus nonresidential floor area may be conditioned on such agreements and instruments.

 h. The housing owner, in the case of rental housing, shall provide annual reports and pay an annual monitoring fee to the Office of Housing for each low-income housing unit. In the case of low-income housing for owner- occupancy, the applicant shall pay an initial monitoring fee to the Office of Housing as specified under Chapter 22.900G, and the recorded resale restrictions shall include a provision requiring payment to the City, on any sale or other transfer of a unit after the initial sale, of a fee in the amount of $500, to be adjusted in proportion to changes in the consumer price index from 2008 to the year in which the sale or transfer is made, for the review and processing of documents to determine compliance with income and affordability restrictions.

 2. Child Care.

 a. For each square foot of nonresidential bonus floor area allowed under this Section 23.58A.024, in addition to providing housing or an alternative cash contribution pursuant to subsection 23.58A.024.B.1 or 23.58A.024.C, an applicant using the child care performance option shall provide fully improved child care facility space sufficient for 0.000127 of a child care slot. The minimum interior space in the child care facility for each child care slot shall comply with all applicable state and local regulations governing the operation of licensed childcare providers. Child care facility space shall be deemed provided only if the applicant causes the space to be newly constructed or newly placed in child care use after the submission of a permit application for the project intended to use the bonus floor area, except as provided in subsection 23.58A.024.B.2.c.6. If any contribution or subsidy in any form is made by any public entity to the acquisition, development, financing or improvement of any child care facility, then any portion of the space in such facility determined by the Human Services Director to be attributable to such contribution or subsidy shall not be considered as provided by any applicant other than that public entity.

 b. Child care space shall be provided on the same lot as the project using the bonus nonresidential floor area, or on another lot within a distance of 0.25 mile of the project using the bonus nonresidential floor area.

 c. Child care space shall be contained in a child care facility satisfying the following standards:~~~~

 1) The child care facility and accessory exterior space must be approved for licensing by the State of Washington Department of Early Learning and any other applicable state or local governmental agencies responsible for the regulation of licensed child care providers.~~~~

 2) At least 20 percent of the number of child care slots for which space is provided as a condition of bonus nonresidential floor area must be reserved for, and affordable to, families with annual incomes at or below the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development Low Income Standard for Section 8 Housing based on family size (or, if such standard shall no longer be published, a standard established by the Human Services Director based generally on 80 percent of the median family income of the Metropolitan Statistical Area, or division thereof, that includes Seattle, adjusted for family size). Child care slots shall be deemed to meet these conditions if they serve, and are limited to, (a) children receiving child care subsidy from the City of Seattle, King County or State Department of Early Learning, and/or (b) children whose families have annual incomes no higher than the above standard who are charged according to a sliding fee scale such that the fees paid by any family do not exceed the amount it would be charged, exclusive of subsidy, if the family were enrolled in the City of Seattle Child Care Assistance Program.

 3) Child care space provided to satisfy bonus conditions shall be dedicated to child care use, consistent with the terms of this Section 23.58A.024, for 20 years. The dedication shall be established by a recorded covenant, running with the land, and enforceable by the City, signed by the owner of the lot where the child care facility is located, or the long-term lessee of the child care space under terms acceptable to the Human Services Director, and by the owner of the lot where the bonus floor area is used, if different from the lot of the child care facility. The child care facility shall be maintained in operation, with adequate staffing, at least 11 hours per day, five days per week, and 50 weeks per year.

 4) Space for which a bonus is or has been allowed under any other section of this Title 23 or under former Title 24 shall not be eligible to satisfy the conditions of this section 23.58A.024.

 5) Unless the applicant is the owner of the child care space and is a duly licensed and experienced child care provider approved by the Human Services Director, the applicant shall provide to such Director a signed agreement, acceptable to such Director, with a duly licensed child care provider, under which the child care provider agrees to operate the child care facility consistent with the terms of this Section 23.58A.024 and of the recorded covenant, and to provide reports and documentation to the City to demonstrate such compliance.

 6) One child care facility may fulfill the conditions for a bonus for more than one project if it includes sufficient space, and provides sufficient slots affordable to limited income families, to satisfy the conditions for each such project without any space or child care slot being counted toward the conditions for more than one project. If the child care facility is located on the same lot as one of the projects using the bonus, then the owner of that lot shall be responsible for maintaining compliance with all the requirements applicable to the child care facility; otherwise responsibility for such requirements shall be allocated by agreement in such manner as the Human Services Director may approve. If a child care facility developed to qualify for bonus floor area by one applicant includes space exceeding the amount necessary for the bonus floor area used by that applicant, then to the extent that the voluntary agreement accepted by the Human Services Director from that applicant so provides, such excess space may be deemed provided by the applicant for a later project pursuant to a new voluntary agreement signed by both such applicants and by any other owner of the child care facility, and a modification of the recorded covenant, each in form and substance acceptable to such Director.

 d. The Human Services Director shall review the design and proposed management plan for any child care facility proposed to qualify for bonus floor area to determine whether it will comply with the terms of this Section 23.58A.024. The allowance of bonus floor area is conditioned upon approval of the design and proposed management plan by such Director. The child care facility shall be constructed consistent with the design approved by such Director and shall be operated for the minimum 20 year term consistent with the management plan approved by such Director, in each case with only such modifications as shall be approved by such Director. If the proposed management plan includes provisions for payment of rent or occupancy costs by the provider, the management plan must include a detailed operating budget, staffing ratios, and other information requested by such Director to assess whether the child care facility may be economically feasible and able to deliver quality services.

 e. The Human Services Director is authorized to accept a voluntary agreement for the provision of a child care facility to satisfy bonus conditions and related agreements and instruments consistent with this Section 23.58A.024. The voluntary agreement may provide, in case a child care facility is not maintained in continuous operation consistent with this subsection 23.58A.024.B.2 at any time within the minimum 20 year period, for the City's right to receive payment of a prorated amount of the alternative cash contribution that then would be applicable to a new project seeking bonus nonresidential floor area, with any adjustments for changes in costs that the Human Services Director may deem appropriate. The Human Services Director may require security or evidence of adequate financial responsibility, or both, as a condition to acceptance of an agreement under this subsection 23.58A.024.B.2. Review and approval of any proposed facilities, plans or other matters by the Human Services Director is in the interest of the City and the general public and not for the particular benefit of any persons or class, and shall not constitute any assurance to any person that any facility or its operations will satisfy any health, safety or other standards or criteria.

 C. Payment Option.

 1. Amount of payments. In lieu of all or part of the performance option for low-income housing, an applicant may provide a cash contribution to the City of $18.75 per square foot of bonus nonresidential floor area, if the Director of Housing determines that the payment achieves a result equal to or better than providing the low-income housing on-site and the payment does not exceed the approximate cost of developing the same number and quality of housing units that would otherwise be developed. In lieu of all or part of the performance option for child care, the applicant may provide a cash contribution to the City of $3.25 per square foot of bonus nonresidential floor area to be used for child care facilities, to be administered by the Human Services Department.

 2. Timing of payments. Cash payments shall be made prior to issuance, and as a condition to issuance, of any building permit after the first building permit for a project, and in any event before any permit for any construction activity other than excavation and shoring is issued.

 3. Deposit and use of payments. Payments in lieu of low-income housing and child care facilities shall be deposited in special accounts established solely to support the development of low-income housing and child care facilities. Earnings on balances in the special accounts shall accrue to those accounts.

 a. The Director of Housing shall use cash payments in lieu of low-income housing and any earnings thereon to support the development of low-income housing in any manner now or hereafter permitted by RCW 36.70A.540, including renter or owner housing for income-eligible households. Uses of funds may include the City's costs to administer projects, not to exceed ten percent of the payments into the special accounts. Low-income housing funded wholly or in part with cash payments shall be located within eligible areas within the Seattle city limits. Eligible areas shall be prioritized in the following order: (1) within the same neighborhoods where the developments using the bonus nonresidential floor area are located; (2) within 0.5 mile of a light rail station or bus rapid transit station on a route serving the neighborhoods where the developments using the bonus nonresidential floor area are located; and (3) within 0.25 mile of a bus or streetcar stop on a route serving the neighborhoods where the developments using the bonus nonresidential floor area are located.

 b. The Human Services Director shall use cash payments in lieu of child care and any earnings thereon to support the development or expansion of child care facilities within 0.5 mile of the project using the bonus nonresidential floor area, or in another location, consistent with an applicable voluntary agreement, where the child care facility addresses the additional need created by that project. Child care facilities supported with cash payments may be publicly or privately owned, and if privately owned shall be committed to long-term use as child care under such agreements or instruments as the Human Services Director shall determine are appropriate. The Human Services Director shall require that child care facilities supported with cash payments and their operators satisfy applicable licensing requirements, and may require compliance with other provisions applicable to child care facilities provided under the performance option, with such modifications as the Human Services Director deems appropriate.

 4. The Director and the Director of Housing are authorized jointly to adopt rules to interpret and implement the provisions of this subsection 23.58A.024.C, in addition to rules that may be adopted by the Director of Housing independently as authorized in this Section 23.58A.024.

 Section 75. Section 23.66.018 of the Seattle Municipal Code, which section was enacted by Ordinance 118012, is amended as follows:

 23.66.018 Director of the Department of Neighborhoods((~~.~~))

 As used in this chapter,  "Director of Neighborhoods", "Department of Neighborhoods Director" and "Director of the Department of Neighborhoods" mean the Director of the department or the Director's designee.

 Section 76. A new Section 23.66.032 of the Seattle Municipal Code is added as follows:

 23.66.032 Contributing structures; determination of architectural or historic significance

 A. The owner of a lot in the Pioneer Square Preservation District or the International Special Review District may apply to the Director of Neighborhoods for a determination that a structure on the lot contributes, and is expected to continue to contribute, to the architectural and/or historic character of the District. A structure for which that determination is made is considered a contributing structure for purposes of this Section 23.66.032 and for purposes of the eligibility of the lot to send South Downtown Historic TDR or South Downtown Historic TDP pursuant to Sections 23.49.014 and 23.58A.018. The determination is made by the Director of Neighborhoods, after recommendation by the Pioneer Square Preservation Board or the International Special Review District Board. A structure for which an application for demolition approval has been granted or is pending is not eligible for a determination under this Section 23.66.032. The Director of Neighborhoods may defer consideration of an application under this Section 23.66.032 until final action is taken on any application for a certificate of approval, and any appeals have been resolved.

 B. In making a recommendation and decision under subsection 23.66.032.A, the relevant Board and the Director of Neighborhoods shall take into account the reasons for designating the District as set forth in Section 23.66.100 or 23.66.302 and how they apply to the structure; whether the structure was identified as historic or as contributing, or both, for purposes of listing in the National Register of Historic Places or the local special review district; and the state of historic integrity, repair, maintenance, and useful life of the structure. The Director of Neighborhoods and the relevant Board may rely on information submitted by the owner, information provided by members of the public, other information available in public records, and site visits. The Director of Neighborhoods may determine that the structure is contributing; that it cannot be contributing; or that it will be contributing conditioned upon specific rehabilitation or maintenance work.

 C.

 Section 77. Section 23.66.100 of the Seattle Municipal Code, which section was last amended by Ordinance 119484, is amended as follows:

 23.66.100 Creation of district, legislative findings and purpose((~~.~~))

 A. During the City of Seattle's relatively brief history, it has had little time in which to develop areas of consistent historical or architectural character. It is recognized that the Pioneer Square area of Seattle contains many of these rare attributes and consequently is an area of great historical and cultural significance. Further, the ((~~King County domed stadium (Kingdome))~~)  regional sports stadiums , constructed in  and near  the Pioneer Square area, and the traffic and activities ((~~which it generates has~~))  that they generate have  resulted in adverse impacts upon the social, cultural, historic and ethnic values of the Pioneer Square area. To preserve, protect, and enhance the historic character of the Pioneer Square area and the buildings therein; to return unproductive structures to useful purposes; to attract visitors to the City; to avoid a proliferation of vehicular parking and vehicular-oriented uses; to provide regulations for existing on-street and off-street parking; to stabilize existing  housing , and encourage a variety of new and rehabilitated housing types for all income groups; to encourage the use of transportation modes other than the private automobile; to protect existing commercial vehicle access; to improve visual and urban relationships between existing and future buildings and structures, parking spaces and public improvements within the area; and to encourage pedestrian uses, there is established as a special review district, the Pioneer Square Preservation District. The boundaries of the District are shown on Map A  for 23.66.100  and on the Official Land Use Map.

 B. The District is depicted on Map A  for 23.66.100.  All property in the entire District shall be developed and used in accordance with the use and development standards established in this ((~~chapter~~))  Chapter 23.66  and the use and development standards for the underlying zone in which the property is located. In the event of irreconcilable differences between the use and development standards of this ((~~chapter~~))  Chapter 23.66  and other provisions of this Land Use Code, ((~~the provisions of~~)) this ((~~chapter~~))  Chapter 23.66  ((~~shall apply~~))  applies, except that nothing in this Chapter 23.66 shall permit any use or development on a lot from which TDR or TDP are transferred that is inconsistent with the restrictions applicable as a result of such transfer pursuant to Chapter 23.49 or Chapter 23.58A .

 C. Reasons for Designating the Pioneer Square Preservation District.

 1. Historic Significance. The Pioneer Square Preservation District is unique because it is the site of the beginning of The City of Seattle. The area also retains much of the original architecture and artifacts of its early history. The District has played a significant role in the development of Seattle, the Puget Sound region and The State of Washington. It was the first location of industry, business and homes in early Seattle and the focus of commerce and transportation for more than a half century.

 2. Architectural Significance. As a collection of late nineteenth and early twentieth-century buildings of similar materials, construction techniques and architectural style, the District is unique, not only to the City but to the country as well. Most of the buildings within the District embody the distinctive characteristics of the Late Victorian style. Many buildings are the work of one architect, Elmer H. Fisher. For these and other reasons, the buildings combine to create an outstanding example of an area that is distinguishable in style, form, character and construction representative of its era.

 3. Social Diversity. The District represents an area of unique social diversity where people from many income levels and social strata live, shop and work. It is an area in which social services, including missions, low-income housing and service agencies exist.

 4. Business Environment. The District is an area of remarkable business diversity. The street level of the area north of S. King Street is pedestrian-oriented, with its storefronts occupied primarily by specialty retail shops, art galleries, restaurants and taverns. The upper floors of buildings in the historic core are occupied by professional offices, various types of light manufacturing, and housing for persons of many income groups. The area south of S. King Street includes the ((~~North Kingdome~~))  stadium's north  parking lot, a number of structures occupied by light manufacturing and warehousing use, and several structures converted to office, residential and mixed use. The ((~~north Kingdome~~))  stadium's north  parking lot may be redeveloped to accommodate a mix of uses, including a substantial amount of housing. The ongoing restoration and sensitive rehabilitation of many District structures, combined with proposed compatible new construction ,  will continue to enhance the District's economic climate.

 5. Educational Value. The restoration and preservation of the District will yield information of educational significance regarding the way of life and the architecture of the late nineteenth-century as well as adding interest and color to the City. Restoration of the District will preserve the environment ((~~which~~))  that  was characteristic of an important era of Seattle's history.

 6. Geographic Location. The District is uniquely situated adjacent to Seattle's waterfront, the central business district, the International District, and ((~~the King County domed~~))  sports  stadium  and exhibition center facilities .

To retain and enhance the visual order of the District, which is created by existing older buildings that provide unique character and form through their subtle detailing and quarter-block and half-block coverage, new development, including exterior remodeling, should respect the architectural and structural integrity of the building in which the work is undertaken, through sympathetic use of colors, material and style. Exterior building facades shall be of a scale compatible with surrounding structures. Window proportions, floor height, cornice line, street elevations and other elements of the building facades shall relate to the scale of the existing buildings in the immediate area.

 B. Asian Design Character District. The boundaries of the  Asian Design Character District of the International District ((~~shall be the same as the~~~~ID Retail Core, as illustrated~~))  are as shown  on Map B  for 23.66.326 . To strengthen and preserve the existing Asian architectural character of the  Asian  Design  Character  District, tiled awnings, recessed balconies, heavy timber construction, and materials and colors as specified below are encouraged.

 1. Materials. Building facades ((~~shall be~~))  are  limited to earthen materials such as brick, concrete, stucco and wood. Other materials ((~~, such as anodized aluminum,~~)) may be used if approved by the ((~~Board~~))  Director of Neighborhoods .

The average height of window sills shall be no greater than ((~~three (3)~~))  3  feet above the sidewalk. A decrease in the percentage of required transparency may be permitted by the Board ((~~when~~))  if :

 a. There is a design constraint, such as permanent wainscoting, and removal or alteration would detract from the structural or architectural integrity of the building; or

 b. The existing layout of the building or other physical constraints such as the placement of load bearing walls or columns creates a hardship. ((~~Whenever~~))  If  transparency requirements are reduced, wall murals, landscaping, colored awnings, display cases, or other means appropriate to the setting shall be provided to create visual interest.
