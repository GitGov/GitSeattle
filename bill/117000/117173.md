 AN ORDINANCE relating to the Seattle Streetcar, accepting donations to fund service enhancements, authorizing changes in the streetcar service plan, and ratifying and confirming prior acts.

 WHEREAS, the City of Seattle constructed the South Lake Union Line of the Seattle Streetcar to provide local transit service and support economic development in South Lake Union, the Denny Triangle, and the Downtown Retail Core; and

 WHEREAS, the South Lake Union area is experiencing significant employment growth which is expected to continue in 2011 and 2012 as tenants move in to new construction; and

 WHEREAS, several employers in the South Lake Union area wish to make a gift of funds to the City of Seattle to fund a pilot project that will increase the frequency of service during the afternoon to evening weekday peak travel period; and

 WHEREAS, while the City is open to accepting third party private donations to pay for additional hours associated with the South Lake Union Streetcar line, it is expected that on-going service enhancements will depend on renewal of the donations and the City's acceptance of the donations in no way obligates the use of additional Metro service hours or City dollars for this purpose once private donations are expended; NOW, THEREFORE,

 BE IT ORDAINED BY THE CITY OF SEATTLE AS FOLLOWS:

 Section 1. The Director of Transportation is authorized to accept gifts of funds to support operation and maintenance of the Seattle Streetcar and to deposit gift funds for this purpose in the Seattle Streetcar Fund.

 Section 2. The Director of Transportation is authorized to revise the Streetcar service plan to provide increased service frequency, within the limits of funding received through donations, and to make revisions to better match service levels to demand, within funding constraints.

 Section 3. Any act consistent with the authority of this ordinance taken after its passage and prior to its effective date is hereby ratified and confirmed.

 Section 4. This ordinance shall take effect and be in force 30 days after its approval by the Mayor, but if not approved and returned by the Mayor within ten days after presentation, it shall take effect as provided by Seattle Municipal Code Section 1.04.020.

 Passed by the City Council the ____ day of ________________________, 2011, and signed by me in open session in authentication of its passage this

 _____ day of ___________________, 2011.
