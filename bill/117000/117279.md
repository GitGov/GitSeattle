 WHEREAS, the Seattle Municipal Code presently taxes activities relating to flour milling in the City of Seattle and the buying and selling of related products in the City at a rate that is one-tenth the rate for flour milled outside the City; and

 A. Upon every person engaging within the City in business as an extractor; as to such persons the amount of the tax with respect to such business shall be equal to the value of the products, including by-products, extracted within the City for sale or for commercial or industrial use, multiplied by the rate of ((~~two hundred fifteen one-thousandths of one percent~~)).00215. The measure of the tax is the value of the products, including by-products, so extracted, regardless of the place of sale or the fact that deliveries may be made to points outside the City.

Upon every person engaging within the City in the business of making sales of retail services, or making sales at wholesale or retail((~~, except persons taxable under subsection D of this section~~)); as to such persons, the amount of tax with respect to such business shall be equal to the gross proceeds of such sales of the business without regard to the place of delivery of articles, commodities or merchandise sold, multiplied by the rate of ((~~two hundred fifteen one-thousandths of one percent~~)).00215.

 1. The credit is equal to the square footage business tax owed for the reporting period multiplied by the ratio of adjusted gross income derived from the Seattle business location(s) for the reporting period to the total gross income derived from the Seattle business location(s) for the reporting period.

 2. For the purpose of this section, "total gross income derived from the Seattle business location(s)" is equal to the total gross income derived from the business activities rendered by, generated from, or attributable to the place(s) of business located within the city.

 3. For the purpose of this section, "adjusted gross income derived from the Seattle business location(s)" shall include total gross income derived from the Seattle business location(s) less:

 (a) income derived from the sales of tangible personal property and retail services by the Seattle business location(s) delivered to a location within the State of Washington where no local jurisdiction imposes an eligible gross receipts tax; and

 (b) the gross income of the Seattle business location(s) subject to the business license tax under ((~~SMC~~))  subsection  5.45.050 .G ((~~H~~)) as determined by ((~~SMC~~)) Section  5.45.060 through ((~~SMC~~)) Section  5.45.080 less the gross income of the Seattle business location(s) subject to the business license tax under ((~~SMC~~)) subsection  5.45.050 .G ((~~H~~)) as determined by ((~~SMC~~)) Section  5.45.060 through ((~~SMC~~)) Section  5.45.076 and (~~(SMC~~)) Section  5.45.081.

 When the change in income calculated in subsection 3(b) is a negative number, the amount so calculated shall reduce the amount calculated in subsection 3(a); however, if the sum of the totals calculated under subsections 3(a) and 3(b) is a negative number, then the adjusted gross income derived from the Seattle business location(s) shall be equal to the total gross income derived from the Seattle business location(s).

 4. In computing the tax credit, any gross receipts from manufacturing, extracting, and printing, and also subject to a selling tax (such as retailing and wholesaling) according to the Multiple Activity Tax Credit (((~~SMC~~)) Section  5.45.070), shall be included in the gross income and the adjusted gross income only once.

 Section 9. The provisions of this ordinance are declared to be separate and severable.
