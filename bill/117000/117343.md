Each Party shall attempt in good faith to coordinate with the other Parties with respect to any future enhancements to a Preferred Plan Project to minimize or eliminate any impact to the interconnected electric systems of such other Parties.

 7. PAYMENT SCHEDULE

 Payments will be made at the completion of individual projects. The Parties shall agree in writing to the method and schedule for the cost share contributions to be made under this MOA.

 8. NATIONAL ENVIRONMENTAL POLICY ACT ASSESSMENT

 To the extent that BPA's financial contributions under this MOA are determined to trigger the need for analysis of projects under the National Environmental Policy Act, the Parties shall coordinate such assessment.

 9. JOINT COMMUNICATIONS

 The Parties shall coordinate joint communications regarding presentations of the preferred plan of service to the public.

 10. GENERAL PROVISIONS

 (a) This MOA, including documents expressly incorporated by reference, constitutes the entire agreement between the Parties. It supersedes all previous communications, representations, or contracts, either written or oral, which purport to describe or embody the subject matter of this MOA.

 (b) No amendment of this MOA shall be of any force or effect unless set forth in a written instrument signed by authorized representatives of each Party.

 (c) This MOA is made and entered into for the sole benefit of the Parties, and the Parties intend that no other person or entity shall be a direct or indirect beneficiary of this MOA.

 (d) This MOA shall be interpreted consistent with and governed by federal law.

 (e) In the event that any provision of this MOA is determined to be invalid or unenforceable for any reason, in whole or part, the remaining provisions of this MOA shall be unaffected thereby and shall remain in full force and effect to the fullest extent permitted by law, and such invalid or unenforceable provision shall be replaced by the Parties with a provision that is valid and enforceable and that comes closest to expressing the Parties' intention with respect to such invalid or unenforceable provision.

 (f) Each Party shall be solely responsible for and shall pay its own costs and expenses incurred by it in connection with the negotiation of this MOA.

 (g) Whenever this MOA requires or provides that (i) a notice be given by a Party to any other Party or (ii) a Party's action requires the approval or consent of any other Party, such notice, consent or approval shall be given in writing and shall be given in accordance with the provisions of Exhibit B to this MOA.

 (h) This MOA is binding on any successors and assigns of the Parties. No Party may otherwise transfer or assign this MOA, in whole or in part, without the other Parties' written consent. Such consent shall not be unreasonably withheld.

 (i) Nothing contained in this MOA shall be construed as creating a corporation, company, partnership, association, joint venture or other entity, nor shall anything contained in this MOA be construed as creating or requiring any fiduciary relationship between the Parties. No Party shall be responsible hereunder for the acts or omissions of any other Party. Nothing herein shall preclude (i) a Party from taking any action (or having its affiliates take any action) with respect to any other transmission project, including any such project that may compete with the projects provided herein, or (ii) the Parties jointly from entering into MOAs with third parties for the joint development, construction, ownership or operation of any project or for the provision of transmission capacity from such project.

 (j) Other than the obligation to pay amounts due under Section 4, in no event shall any Party be liable to any other Party under any provision of this MOA for any losses, damages, costs or expenses for any direct, special, indirect, incidental, consequential, or punitive damages, including but not limited to loss of profit or revenue, whether based in whole or in part in contract or in tort, including negligence, strict liability, or any other theory of liability; provided, however, that damages for which a Party may be liable to any other Party under another agreement will not be considered to be special, indirect, incidental, or consequential damages hereunder.

 (k) The Parties shall not be in breach of their respective obligations to the extent the failure to fulfill any obligation is due to an Uncontrollable Force. "Uncontrollable Force" means an event beyond the reasonable control of, and without the fault or negligence of, the Party claiming the Uncontrollable Force, that prevents that Party from performing its contractual obligations under this MOA and which, by exercise of that party's reasonable care, diligence and foresight, such Party was unable to avoid. Uncontrollable Forces include, but are not limited to:

 (1) strikes or work stoppage;

 (2) floods, earthquakes, or other natural disasters; terrorist acts; and

 (3) final orders or injunctions issued by a court or regulatory body having competent subject matter jurisdiction which the Party claiming the Uncontrollable Force, after diligent efforts, was unable to have stayed, suspended, or set aside pending review by a court of competent subject matter jurisdiction.

 Neither the unavailability of funds or financing, nor conditions of national or local economies or markets shall be considered an Uncontrollable Force. The economic hardship of a Party shall not constitute an Uncontrollable Force. Nothing contained in this provision shall be construed to require any Party to settle any strike or labor dispute in which it may be involved.

 If an Uncontrollable Force prevents a Party from performing any of its obligations under this MOA, such party shall: (1) immediately notify the other Parties of such Uncontrollable Force by any means practicable and confirm such notice in writing as soon as reasonably practicable; (2) use its best efforts to mitigate the effects of such Uncontrollable Force, remedy its inability to perform, and resume full performance of its obligation hereunder as soon as reasonably practicable; (3) keep the other Parties apprised of such efforts on an ongoing basis; and (4) provide written notice of the resumption of performance. Written notices sent under this section 10(k) must comply with Exhibit B, Notices and Contact Information.

 11. WAIVER

 No waiver of any provision or breach of this MOA shall be effective unless such waiver is in writing and signed by the waiving Party, and any such waiver shall not be deemed a waiver of any other provision of this MOA or any other breach of this MOA.

 12. SIGNATURE

 The Parties have caused this MOA to be executed as of the latest date all Parties have signed this MOA.
