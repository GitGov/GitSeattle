 ORDINANCE _________________

 AN ORDINANCE relating to the City Light Department; amending the Community Solar Program established in Seattle Municipal Code 21.49.087.

 WHEREAS, Ordinance 123479 established SMC 21.49.087 which authorizes City Light to offer a Community Solar program and establishes a Community Solar rate; and

 WHEREAS, all Seattle City Light customers will be eligible to participate in the program, subject to limited space availability; and

 WHEREAS, SMC 21.49.087 includes specifications that the Community Solar program be offered on a first-come, first-served basis; and

 WHEREAS, this revision to the legislation will allow City Light to implement the Community Solar program using methods to select program participants that are equitable to all customers and more in line with the principles of Seattle's Race and Social Justice Initiative, without impacting the goals, intent, or rates associated with the program;

 NOW, THEREFORE,

 BE IT ORDAINED BY THE CITY OF SEATTLE AS FOLLOWS:

 Section 1. Section 21.49.087 of the Seattle Municipal Code is amended to read as follows:

 21.49.087 Community Solar Program

 A. The Community Solar Program allows customers to receive credits based on energy

 production from a solar photovoltaic (PV) array owned and managed by Seattle City Light.

 B. The Community Solar Program ((~~shall~~))  may  be  offered on a voluntary  basis  ((~~and~~

~~available to all customers~~~~on a first-come, first-served basis~~)) beginning in 2011. All Seattle City

 Light customers are eligible to participate, subject to limited space availability. Interested

 customers will initiate their participation with a voluntary one- time upfront payment and signed

 participant contract.

 C. Each participating customer will receive an energy credit for each kWh produced by

 their portion of their assigned solar PV array, to be distributed annually as specified in a standard

 participant contract developed by the Department.

 D. The credit for kWh produced by community solar PV arrays shall be equal to Seattle

 City Light's small general service energy charge for the City of Seattle (Schedule SMC)

 for all community solar participants, regardless of the rate schedule they fall under

 themselves.

 E. Each participating customer will also receive annual renewable energy production

 incentive payments in accordance with RCW 82.16.110, as available through June, 2020.

 F. The first community solar array owned by Seattle City Light will initially be funded by

 a Department of Energy grant of $300,000. The voluntary Community Solar Program

 payments (enrollment fees) will replace some or all of the grant funding, and will be used

 to finance additional arrays in the same manner.

 G. Seattle City Light has the right to terminate enrollment of new customers into the

 program at any time, but will meet obligations to participating customers through the

 term of their contracts.

 H. Terms and conditions of the program will be developed by City Light and made

 available to program participants prior to their enrollment.

 Section 2. This ordinance shall take effect and be in force 30 days after its approval by the Mayor, but if not approved and returned by the Mayor within ten days after presentation, it shall take effect as provided by Seattle Municipal Code Section 1.04.020.

 Passed by the City Council the ____ day of ________________________, 2011, and signed by me in open session in authentication of its passage this

 _____ day of ___________________, 2011.
