 ORDINANCE _________________

 AN ORDINANCE relating to land use, zoning and lots, amending Sections 23.22.100, 23.24.040, 23.24.046, 23.28.030, 23.41.012, 23.44.010, and 23.44.012, to require standards for configuration of platted lots, to add specific standards for development on lots qualifying for exceptions to minimum lot area standards in Single Family zones, and to clarify existing standards for structures eligible for unit lot subdivisions.

 WHEREAS, the City of Seattle lacks specific standards for configuration of platted lots, standards which are common in other urban jurisdictions; and

 WHEREAS, the lack of lot configuration standards has resulted in the creation of lots that do not reflect the prevailing platting pattern of existing neighborhoods, resulting in confusion about lot ownership, a property owner's rights and responsibilities to neighboring properties, and rights to pedestrian and vehicular access ; and

 WHEREAS, the lack of lot configuration standards has resulted in the permitting of structures that are out of proportion within existing neighborhoods, evidenced by the size, orientation, and scale of new structures; and

 WHEREAS, odd-shaped lots in all zones raise issues of confusion as to the location of property lines, present issues of access to portions of lots for use and maintenance, potential confusion of ownership and loss of property, or creation of nonconformity due to claims of adverse possession, and may interfere with the purpose of other development standards including but not limited to yard, setback or lot coverage requirements; NOW THEREFORE,

 BE IT ORDAINED BY THE CITY OF SEATTLE AS FOLLOWS:

 Section 1. Section 23.22.100 of the Seattle Municipal Code, which Section was last amended by Ordinance 122615, is amended as follows:

 A. Streets and Alleys.

 1. All subdivisions shall be served by one ((~~(1)~~)) or more streets providing adequate ingress and egress to and from the subdivision.

 2. New streets within each subdivision shall conform ((~~with~~))  to  the City's thoroughfare and circulation plans and shall provide for the continuation of streets that serve the property contiguous to the subdivision. Streets serving lots on two ((~~(2)~~)) sides shall be at least ((~~sixty (~~))60((~~)~~)) feet wide unless a narrower street is warranted by special physical circumstances as determined by the Director, in consultation with the Director of Transportation, or as specified in Section 3.1.2b (for nonarterial streets) or 3.1.1a (for arterials) of the  Seattle Right-of-Way Improvements Manual.

 3. Street intersections shall be as nearly at right angles as practicable and in no event shall the angle formed be less than ((~~thirty (~~))30((~~)~~)) degrees.

 4. A cul-de-sac shall be designed according to the  Seattle  Right-of-Way Improvements Manual to provide a circular turnaround at the closed end. A tee or other reasonable alternative may be authorized by the Hearing Examiner in lieu of the turnaround. Cul-de-sac streets shall not exceed ((~~four hundred fifty (~~))450((~~)~~)) feet in length and the right-of-way shall be at least ((~~fifty (~~))50((~~)~~)) feet wide, except under special circumstances a lesser width ((~~will be~~))  is  permitted.

 5. Street networks shall provide ready access for fire and other emergency vehicles and equipment, and routes of escape for inhabitants.

 6. Alleys shall be at least ((~~sixteen (~~))16((~~)~~)) feet wide plus such additional width as ((~~shall be~~))  is  necessary for an adequate turning radius.

 B. Blocks. Blocks shall be designed to ((~~assure~~))  promote  traffic safety and ease of traffic control and circulation. Blocks shall be identified by letters or numbers.

 C. Lots.

 1. Every lot shall be provided with convenient pedestrian and vehicular access to a street or to a permanent appurtenant easement that satisfies the requirements of Sections 23.53.005 and 23.53.006.

 2. Lots shall be numbered with reference to blocks.

 3. Every lot, except unit lots and lots proposed to be platted for individual live-work units in zones where live-work units are permitted, shall conform to the following standards for lot configuration, unless a special exception is authorized under subsection 23.22.100.D:

 a. If a lot is proposed with street frontage, then one lot line shall abut the street for at least 10 feet; and

 b. No lot shall be less than 10 feet wide for a distance of more than 10 feet as measured at any point; and

 d. If the property proposed for subdivision is adjacent to an alley, and the adjacent alley is either improved or required to be improved according to the standards of Section 23.53.030, then no new lot shall be proposed that does not provide alley access for vehicles, except that access from a street to an existing use or structure is not required to be changed to alley access. Proposed new lots shall have sufficient frontage on the alley to meet access standards for the zone in which the property is located.

 D.  Special Exception. The Director's recommendation on a proposed subdivision, as a Type II special exception decision, may modify the standards of subsection 23.22.100.C.3, if the applicant demonstrates that the proposed plat meets the following criteria:

 b. Location of existing principal structures that are retained on a lot existing prior to the proposed platting require a platting configuration of one or more lots that cannot reasonably meet the standards of subsection 23.22.100.C.3;

 c. Location of existing easements or feasibility of access to portions of the property prevents the configuration of proposed plat lines that meet the standards of subsection 23.22.100.C.3.

 2. Modification of the standards of subsection 23.22.100.C.3 shall be the minimum necessary to allow platting of lots that each contain a building area for development meeting the development standards of the zone in which the proposed plat is located.

 3. Lots created under the special exception standards of this subsection 23.22.100.D shall not have a configuration that requires a variance from setbacks and yard requirements of the Land Use Code or a variance or exception from the Regulations for Environmentally Critical Areas for any development that may be proposed on the lots.

((~~D~~)) E . Design Standards for Pedestrian Access and Circulation. Design of sidewalks and private sidewalk easements for pedestrian access and circulation shall meet the standards of the  Seattle  Right-of-Way Improvement s  Manual.

 23.44.010 Lot requirements

 * * *

 B. Exceptions to Minimum Lot Area Requirements. The following exceptions to minimum lot area requirements are allowed,  subject to the development standards for undersized lots in subsection 23.44.010.C,  except as limited under subsection 23.44.010.B.2:

 1. A lot that does not satisfy the minimum lot area requirements of its zone may be developed or redeveloped separately under one of the following circumstances:

 a. "The Seventy-Five/Eighty Rule."

 1) If the lot was established as a separate building site in the public records of the county or City prior to July 24, 1957, by deed, contract of sale, mortgage, property tax segregation, platting or building permit and has an area of at least 75 percent of the minimum required lot area and at least 80 percent of the mean lot area of the lots on the same block face and within the same zone in which the lot is located (Exhibit A for 23.44.010 ) , or

 2) If the lot is or was created by subdivision, short subdivision or lot boundary adjustment, is at least 75 percent of the minimum required lot area, and is at least 80 percent of the mean lot area of the lots on the same block face within which the lot will be located and within the same zone (Exhibit A for 23.44.010).

 3) For purposes of this subsection 23.44.010.B.1.a, if the platting pattern is irregular, the Director will determine which lots are included within a block face.

 4) A determination whether a lot qualifies for this exception shall be made on the basis of facts in existence as of the date of application for a short plat or building permit for that lot.

 5) New lots created pursuant to subsection 23.44.010.B.1.a.2 shall comply with the following standards:

 a) for a lot that is subdivided or short platted, the configuration requirements of subsections 23.22.100.C.3 and 23.24.040.A.9 or with the modification provisions of subsections 23.22.100.D and 23.24.040.B, as applicable; or

 b) for an existing lot that is reconfigured under the provisions of Chapter 23.28, the configuration requirements of subsection 23.28.030.A.3 or with the or modification provisions of subsection 23.28.030.A.4.

 b. The lot area deficit is the result of a dedication or sale of a portion of the lot to the City or state for street or highway purposes, payment was received for only that portion of the lot, and the lot area remaining is at least 50 percent of the minimum required.

 c. The lot would qualify as a legal building site under subsection 23.44.010.B but for a reduction in lot area due to court- ordered adverse possession, and the amount by which the lot was so reduced was less than 10 percent of the former area of the lot. This exception does not apply to lots reduced to less than 50 percent of the minimum area required under subsection 23.44.010.A

 d. The lot was established as a separate building site in the public records of the county or City prior to July 24, 1957, by deed, contract of sale, mortgage, property tax segregation, platting or building permit, and falls into one of the following categories:

 1) The lot has not been held in common ownership with any contiguous lot after January 17, 1987, or

 2) The lot is or has been held in common ownership with a contiguous lot after January 17, 1987 and is or has been developed with a principal structure that is wholly within the lot's boundaries, but only if no portion of any contiguous lot is required to meet the least restrictive of lot area, lot coverage, setback or yard requirements that were in effect at the time of the original construction of the principal structure, at the time of its subsequent additions, or that are in effect at the time of redevelopment of the lot (Exhibit B for 23.44.010), or

 3) The lot is or has been held in common ownership with a contiguous lot after January 17, 1987 and is not developed with all or part of a principal structure, but only if no portion of the lot is required to meet the least restrictive of lot area, lot coverage, setback or yard requirements that were in effect for a principal structure on the contiguous lot at the time of the construction of the principal structure, at the time of its subsequent additions, or that are in effect at the time of the development of the lot (Exhibit B for 23.44.010). If any portion of the lot to be developed has been used to meet the parking requirement in effect for a principal structure on a contiguous lot, such parking requirement must continue to be met on the lot to be developed or alternative parking that meets the requirements of this Land Use Code must be provided for the contiguous lot.

 4) For purposes of subsection 23.44.010.B.1.d, removal of all or any part of a principal structure or destruction by fire or act of nature on or after January 18, 1987, does not qualify the lot for this minimum lot area exception (Exhibit C for 23.44.010) except that minor features containing no interior floor area including but not limited to eaves and unenclosed decks extending onto an adjacent property do not serve to tie the properties together for purposes of this exception, and these features may be removed to allow separate development of the lots if they otherwise qualify; or

 e. The lot is within a Clustered Housing Planned Development pursuant to Section 23.44.024, a Planned Residential Development pursuant to Section 23.44.034, or a development approved as an environmentally critical areas conditional use pursuant to Section 25.09.260.

 f. The lot is or was created by short subdivision of a lot containing more than one existing single family dwelling unit pursuant to Section 23.24.046.

 2. Limitations.

 a. Development may occur on a substandard lot containing a riparian corridor, a shoreline habitat and shoreline habitat buffer, a wetland and wetland buffer, or a steep slope and steep slope buffer pursuant to the provisions of Chapter 25.09, Regulations for Environmentally Critical Areas, if the following conditions apply:

 1) The substandard lot is not held in common ownership with an adjacent lot or lots at any time after October 31, 1992, or

 2) The substandard lot is held in common ownership with an adjacent lot or lots, or has been held in common ownership at any time after October 31, 1992, if proposed and future development will not intrude into the environmentally critical area or buffer .

 b. Lots on totally submerged lands do not qualify for any minimum lot area exceptions.

 C.  Development standards for certain lots that qualify for the exception to minimum area in subsection 23.44.010.B.1.d. Development on those lots that meet the conditions outlined in subsection 23.44.010.B.1.d but have a total area less than 2,500 square feet shall comply with the following:

 1. The height standards of Section 23.44.012.A.3.

 2. Structure depth shall not exceed two times the width of the lot, for any lot less than 30 feet wide. If a side yard easement is provided according to subsection 23.44.014.D.3, then the easement area may be included as part of the width of the lot for purposes of compliance with this subsection 23.44.010.C.2.

 D.  Maximum Lot Coverage. The maximum lot coverage permitted for principal and accessory structures is as follows:

```
<table><tr><td>Lot Size

</td><td>Maximum Lot Coverage

</td></tr>

<tr><td>Less than 5,000 square feet (sq. ft.)

</td><td>1,000 sq. ft. + 15% of lot area

</td></tr>

<tr><td>5,000 sq. ft. or more

</td><td>35% of lot area

</td></tr>

</table> For purposes of computing maximum lot coverage, only those portions of a lot that measure at least 10 feet in any direction shall be included in lot coverage calculations, except for portions of a lot that are used for access or that are granted a waiver under subsections 23.22.100.D, 23.24.040.B, or 23.28.030.A.4 for the purpose of providing access.  ((~~D~~)) E . Lot Coverage Exceptions.
