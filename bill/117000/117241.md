 THIRD AMENDMENT TO

 HOUSING COOPERATION AGREEMENT

 BETWEEN

 THE CITY OF SEATTLE AND THE

 HOUSING AUTHORITY OF THE CITY OF SEATTLE

 (Low-Income Elderly and Handicapped Housing)

 This Amendment modifies the Housing Cooperation Agreement between THE CITY OF SEATTLE ("City"), a Washington municipal corporation, and the HOUSING AUTHORITY OF THE CITY OF SEATTLE ("Housing Authority"), a Washington public body corporate and politic, dated May 26, 1982, relating to the dwelling units developed for Low-Income Elderly or Handicapped Persons with proceeds of the City's bonds issued pursuant to City Ordinance 110124. The Housing Cooperation Agreement was authorized by Ordinance 110433 and previously modified pursuant to Ordinance 119424, by an amendment dated as of July 15, 1999, and subsequently modified pursuant to Ordinance 120528, by an amendment dated as of September 7, 2001 (as so amended, it is referred to herein as the "Cooperation Agreement").

 RECITALS

 Pursuant to Ordinance 110124 there was presented to the voters of The City of Seattle in November 1981, and the voters approved, a ballot proposition for the issuance of general obligation bonds of the City in the amount of $48,170,000 ("Bonds") to finance low-income elderly and handicapped housing to be acquired and developed by the Housing Authority of the City of Seattle.

 Since the passage of Ordinance 110124 and execution of the original Housing Cooperation Agreement the Housing Authority has, with the proceeds of the Bonds, acquired and developed housing for low-income elderly and handicapped residents of Seattle.

 Certain projects financed with the Bonds that have reached or are near the end of the projected 25-year life stated in Ordinance 110124 may be able to serve low-income older persons and persons with disabilities over a longer term, or more efficiently, if ownership is transferred to non-profit organizations dedicated to serving such persons subject to appropriate conditions and restrictions and subject to monitoring by the City Office of Housing.

 The City and the Housing Authority wish to amend the Cooperation Agreement to permit such transfers, subject to City approval in each case.

 NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the mutual covenants herein, the parties hereby agree as follows:

 1. Sale of Property: Section 10 of the Cooperation Agreement is amended as follows:

 10. Sale of ((~~Excess~~)) Property. Any real property constituting part of the Project (including housing units developed thereon) may be sold or otherwise disposed of by the Housing Authority to the extent permitted by law  (a)  if utilization of such housing units for the purpose s  of the Ordinance is no longer feasible ;  or  (b)  if such sale or other disposition would further the purposes of the Ordinance by increasing the supply of housing for Low-Income Elderly or Handicapped Persons ; or (c) if such sale or other disposition will facilitate the continued use of the property as housing for Low- Income Elderly or Handicapped Persons;  provided that no ((~~such~~)) sale  or other disposition  may occur without the approval of the City by Ordinance and upon such terms and conditions as it may impose. The proceeds of any such sale, including interest if the sale is on a deferred payment basis, shall be remitted to the City for deposit in the Development Fund to be used for the same purposes as authorized for use of the Bond proceeds provided that if this Agreement or the Project is terminated under Article 13, or if the Housing Authority is unable to utilize the funds for Capital Costs of the Project, such proceeds shall be returned to the City.

 2. Miscellaneous. Except as expressly set forth above, the terms of the Cooperation Agreement remain in full force and effect. No waiver of modifications of the terms of the Cooperation Agreement, as amended, is or shall be valid unless in writing and signed by the duly authorized officer of each party hereto. This Amendment may be executed in two or more counterparts, which together shall constitute a single agreement. Capitalized terms not defined herein shall have the meanings set forth in the Cooperation Agreement unless the context otherwise requires.

 IN WITNESS WHEREOF The City and the Housing Authority have executed this Amendment as of the ______ day of _________, 2011.
