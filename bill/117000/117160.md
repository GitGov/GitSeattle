 WHEREAS, Seattle Municipal Code Section 1.12.010 defines "Standard Time" but reflects outdated beginning and ending dates for daylight saving time; and

 WHEREAS, federal laws and regulations specify that Seattle is in the Pacific time zone and specify beginning and ending dates for daylight saving time, thereby rendering unnecessary a definition of standard time in the Seattle Municipal Code; NOW, THEREFORE,

~~1.12.020 - Standard Time to govern.~~

~~The Standard Time provided for in this chapter shall govern the opening and closing of all City public offices therein; and in all provisions of the Charter and ordinances of the City, and in all orders, rules and regulations pursuant thereto, relating to the time of performance of any act by any person or by any officer or official department of the City, or relating to the time within which any right shall accrue or determine, or within which any act shall or shall not be performed by any person pursuant to the Charter or ordinances of the City, it shall be understood and intended that the time within which the act is or is not to be performed, or such rights shall accrue or determine, shall be the Standard Time of the City as adopted in this chapter.~~))
