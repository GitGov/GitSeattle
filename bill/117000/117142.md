 WHEREAS, Chapter 39.34 RCW (Interlocal Cooperation Act) permits local governmental entities to make the most efficient use of their powers by enabling them to cooperate on the basis of mutual advantage; and

 WHEREAS, pursuant to Ordinance 123397, the STBD was created for preserving and maintaining transportation infrastructure, improving public safety, implementing elements of the Seattle Transportation Strategic Plan and other planning documents, investing in bicycle, pedestrian, freight mobility and transit enhancements and providing people with choices to meet their mobility needs; and

 WHEREAS, the STBD has established a $20 vehicle license fee as authorized by RCW 36.73.065 and through STBD Resolution 1, delineated the use of these revenues by the City of Seattle; and

 1.  Purpose and Interpretation.  The City of Seattle is empowered by Chapter 35.22 RCW to improve, maintain and protect public ways, including bridges, viaducts and tunnels. The STBD has been constituted in accordance with state law to provide a source of funding to support transportation improvements that benefit the residents of the City of Seattle and the STBD. The STBD has no employees and its officers are either City Councilmembers serving in an ex officio capacity or are City employees designated to serve under the provisions of state law. In order to make the most efficient use of public funds, to avoid duplication of effort and to coordinate their efforts, the parties have entered into this agreement. In the event that any provision of this agreement is held to be in conflict with existing state statute or any future amendment thereof, such provisions shall be severable, and the remaining provisions of this agreement shall remain in full force and effect.

 2.1 Provide to the City of Seattle all funding received from any and all lawful sources which the STBD in its sole discretion may levy for the purpose of completing the STBD's authorized projects.

 2.2 Continue the annual provision of funding for the projects approved by the STBD, so long as the STBD remains in existence. Such funding shall be in accordance with and limited by the provisions of Ordinance 123397, the charter of the STBD, and Chapter 36.73 RCW.

No joint property ownership is contemplated under the terms of this agreement.

 5.  No Joint Board.  No provision is made for a joint board. The STBD shall exercise its function in accordance with its charter, using staff as provided by the City of Seattle, pursuant to law and to this agreement.

 6.  Termination.  This agreement shall terminate or expire as follows:

 6.1 This agreement may be terminated by either party upon the provision of one hundred and eighty (180) calendar days notice. A final reconciliation of costs, payment, and a current report of completed activities shall be completed by Seattle within such period following the notice by either party.

 6.2 Unless sooner terminated by either party, this agreement shall expire on the date when the STBD is automatically dissolved in accordance with provisions of RCW 36.73 and City of Seattle Ordinance 123397, as the same exists or is hereafter amended.
