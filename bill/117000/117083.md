The terms and conditions of Seattle Tilth's continued use and occupancy for the successive terms will be subject to mutual agreement of the parties.

 ARTICLE 5. USE FEES; TAXES; OFFSETS; LATE FEES

 5.1  Annual Use Fee . For the term of this agreement, Seattle Tilth shall pay to DPR an annual Use Fee of $35,000, payable in arrears in two installments of $17,500; one payable and due annually on the thirtieth (30th) day of June and the second one due annually on the thirty-first (31st) day of December.

Any and all taxes shall be paid by Seattle Tilth with no offset or deduction whatsoever.

 5.3  Annual Use Fee Offset . One hundred percent (100 %) of the annual Use Fee due under this Agreement and noted in Article 5.1 is eligible for offset with programming services to or for the benefit of the City ("Service Credits"). Services that are eligible for Service Credits are Community Programming and other activities as specified in Exhibit 2. If Seattle Tilth desires to take advantage of this opportunity during the term of this Agreement, then Seattle Tilth must perform these program services and maintenance work prior to the due dates noted in Article 5.1. Seattle Tilth shall send a written report in accordance with Article 3.8 which details the program services and maintenance rendered and the value of such services, supported by an itemized accounting of time, labor rates, and materials, with corresponding dollar values.

 The parties recognize that the value of the Community Programming and maintenance and other items that Seattle Tilth must provide under this Agreement may exceed the amount of the annual Use Fee. Under no circumstances will the City owe Seattle Tilth any money or credit if the value of the Community Programming and maintenance and other items exceeds the amount of the annual Use Fee. Under no circumstances may program activities funded from grants or other financial assistance provided by the City of Seattle be used to offset the annual Use Fee. Moreover, Seattle Tilth's obligation to use the Premises for Community Programming and to provide maintenance and perform its obligations under this Agreement shall not be limited by the amount of Service Credits that offset the annual Use Fee.

 5.4  Late and Refused Payments.  Seattle Tilth acknowledges that late payment to the City of the Use Fee or any other sum due to the City hereunder will cause DPR to incur costs not contemplated by this Agreement, including, but not limited to, processing and accounting charges. Therefore, in the event Seattle Tilth fails to pay any sum after such amount is due to the City, such amount shall bear interest at the rate of twelve percent (12%) per annum from the date due until the date paid. Additionally, a Twenty Dollar ($20.00) charge shall be paid by Seattle Tilth to the City for each check refused payment for insufficient funds or any other reason.

 12.2  Use Fee Obligation in Event of Damage or Destruction . If the Premises is destroyed or damaged by fire or other casualty, and such destruction or damage is so extensive as to render such Premises unusable (either because of the need to rebuild or to clean and refurbish the same), and if Seattle Tilth has given timely notice of such destruction or damage as provided by this Article, then Seattle Tilth's obligation to pay Use Fees shall be abated until the date that the Premises is made usable. The unusability of the Premises and the duration of any such Use Fee abatement shall be reasonably determined by the Superintendent and confirmed by one or more notices to Seattle Tilth. If only a portion of the Premises is damaged or destroyed by fire or other casualty but the remainder of such Premises remains usable, as reasonably determined by the Superintendent, and Seattle Tilth has given timely notice of such destruction or damage as provided by this Article, then Seattle Tilth shall pay a reduced amount of Use Fee that is  proportionate to the extent of the Premises that remains usable for the purposes identified in Article 2 hereof, which reduced Use Fee amount shall be reasonably determined by the Superintendent and identified by notice to Seattle Tilth, and paid by Seattle Tilth through the date reasonably specified by the Superintendent in such notice or the later date specified in any subsequent notice.

 12.3  Community Programming Obligation in Event of Damage or Destruction . If the Premises is destroyed or damaged by fire or other casualty, and such destruction or damage is so extensive as to render such Premises unusable (either because of the need to rebuild or to clean and refurbish the same), then Seattle Tilth's obligation to provide Community Programming shall be abated until the date that the Premises is made usable. The unusability of the Premises and the duration of any such Community Programming abatement shall be reasonably determined by the Superintendent and confirmed by one or more notices to Seattle Tilth. If only a portion of the Premises is damaged or destroyed by fire or other casualty but the remainder of such Premises remains usable, as reasonably determined by the Superintendent, then Seattle Tilth shall offer a reduced schedule of Community Programming and/or offer Community Programming with a reduced capacity, as shall be reasonably determined by the Superintendent, in consultation with Seattle Tilth, and identified by notice to Seattle Tilth.

 12.4  Rebuilding and Repair . If the Premises is damaged or destroyed, whether in whole or in part, the City, in its sole discretion, may repair, rebuild, or demolish the Premises.
