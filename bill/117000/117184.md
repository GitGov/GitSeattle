 Containing 347 square feet, more or less.

 (the "Easement Area")

 This easement shall include only such rights in the land above described as the Grantor possesses and that are necessary for the maintenance and repair of the existing elevated deck and retaining wall. Grantees, or their successors or assigns, may not landscape, plant vegetation, reconstruct the deck, or change the land, deck or retaining wall in any way without prior written permission by the Grantor, or its successors or assigns. Any permission granted by Grantor must be recorded with King County. Such permission shall not be unreasonably withheld.

 Grantee understands and agrees that no other structures shall be permitted in the Easement Area and that this Easement Agreement is subject to and subordinate to that certain Easement granted to the Washington Natural Gas Company, dated December 11, 1987 and recorded under King County Recording No. 8801040475 ("WNG Easement"). Grantee acknowledges and understands that Washington Natural Gas Company, by and through its successor, Puget Sound Energy, has certain rights within a portion of the Easement Area that prevents any structures from being built.

 The Grantees shall have the right without prior institution of any suit or proceeding at law, at such time as may be necessary, to enter upon the Easement Area for the purposes herein described, without incurring any legal obligation or liability therefore.

 The Grantor shall have the right without prior institution of any suit or proceeding at law, at such time as may be necessary, to enter upon the Easement Area without incurring any legal obligation or liability therefore.

 The Grantees acknowledge that the City presently has an 18" stormwater mainline and an 8" sanitary sewer within or in the vicinity of the Easement Area.

 The Grantor shall at all times have free access to the Easement Area for the operation, maintenance, replacement and repair of its stormwater mainline and sanitary sewer. In the event that the Deck is destroyed or damaged during such operation, maintenance, replacement or repair, the Grantees shall not be entitled to payment for damages to the Deck or for the loss of use of the Deck.

 This non-exclusive easement does not supersede the easement rights granted to other parties nor shall it interfere with the City's or other party's facilities in City property.

 Grantee shall protect, defend, indemnify and hold harmless Grantor, its officials, employees, agents and successors from any and all costs (including attorneys' fees and costs), claims, demands, judgments, damages, or liability of any kind, including personal injury or damages to property, which arise out of, or in any way results from, or are connected to, or due to any negligent acts, omissions or willful misconduct, or any breach of this Easement Agreement by Grantee in Grantee's use of the deck structure, or exercise of any rights granted herein under this Easement Agreement; provided, however, that Grantee shall not be liable to Grantor for any loss, damage or liability resulting from the sole negligence or willful act or omission of Grantor(s), its heirs, legal representatives, successors or assigns, or the concurrent negligence of Grantor(s), its heirs, legal representatives, successors or assigns to the extent of such concurrent negligence.

 The covenants herein contained shall run with the land and shall be binding on the parties, their successors and assigns forever.
