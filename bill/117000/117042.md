 ORDINANCE _________________

 AN ORDINANCE relating to the annual budget of the Office of Arts and Cultural Affairs ("OACA"); amending Sections 3.14.830 and 5.40.120 of the Seattle Municipal Code.

 WHEREAS, In November 2002, the City Council adopted Ordinance 121006, which changed the department and citizen commission then both known as the Seattle Arts Commission (SAC); reorganized the department into a new Executive department, the Office of Arts and Cultural Affairs (OACA); recreated SAC as an advisory body; set forth the duties of OACA and SAC, and the role of SAC in the review of the Mayor's proposed budget for that office; and affirmed OACA's use of 20% of the City's Admission Tax revenues that were used to fund the activities of the SAC when it acted as a governing body; and

 WHEREAS, in November 2009, the City Council adopted Ordinance 123155 which, following a recommendation by the Mayor and OACA, increased the portion of the Admission Tax revenue directed to OACA from 20% to 75%, and also removed general fund support from OACA ; and

 WHEREAS, Ordinance 123155 clarified that the City Council's dedication of a portion of the City's Admission Tax revenues to arts and culture was intended to provide a "relatively stable and dedicated revenue stream to fund OACA's core programs"; and

 WHEREAS, the City Council's review of the Mayor's proposed 2011-2012 budget raised concerns about the fiscal health of the Department of Parks and Recreation, and the Council therefore supports the short-term use of admission tax revenues to fund arts-related programming conducted by the Department of Parks and Recreation; NOW THEREFORE,

 BE IT ORDAINED BY THE CITY OF SEATTLE AS FOLLOWS:

 Section 1. Section 3.14.830 of the Seattle Municipal Code, which section was enacted by Ordinance 121006, is amended as follows:

 D.
