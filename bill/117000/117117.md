 * * *

 C. Just Cause Eviction.

 1. Pursuant to provisions of the state Residential Landlord-Tenant Act (RCW 59.18.290), owners may not evict residential tenants without a court order, which can be issued by a court only after the tenant has an opportunity in a show cause hearing to contest the eviction (RCW 59.18.380). In addition, owners of housing units shall not evict or attempt to evict any tenant, or otherwise terminate or attempt to terminate the tenancy of any tenant unless the owner can prove in court that just cause exists. The reasons for termination of tenancy listed below, and no others, shall constitute just cause under this section  22.206.160 :

 a. The tenant fails to comply with a three ((~~(3)~~)) day notice to pay rent or vacate pursuant to RCW 59.12.030(3); a ten ((~~(10)~~)) day notice to comply or vacate pursuant to RCW 59.12.030(4); or a three ((~~(3)~~)) day notice to vacate for waste, nuisance (including a drug-related activity nuisance pursuant to RCW Chapter 7.43) or maintenance of an unlawful business or conduct pursuant to RCW 59.12.030(5);

 c. The tenant fails to comply with a ten ((~~(10)~~)) day notice to comply or vacate that requires compliance with a material term of the rental agreement or that requires compliance with a material obligation under RCW 59.18;

 d. The tenant habitually fails to comply with the material terms of the rental agreement which causes the owner to serve a ten ((~~(10)~~)) day notice to comply or vacate three ((~~(3)~~)) or more times in a ((~~twelve (~~))12((~~)~~)) month period;

 e. The owner seeks possession so that the owner or a member of his or her immediate family may occupy the unit as that person's principal residence and no substantially equivalent unit is vacant and available in the same building. "Immediate family" shall include the owner's domestic partner registered pursuant to Section 1 of Ordinance 1172442 or the owner's spouse, parents, grandparents, children, brothers and sisters of the owner, of the owner's spouse, or of the owner's domestic partner. There shall be a rebuttable presumption of a violation of this subsection  22.206.160C.1.a  if the owner or a member of the owner's immediate family fails to occupy the unit as that person's principal residence for at least ((~~sixty (~~))60((~~)~~)) consecutive days during the ((~~ninety (~~))90((~~)~~)) days immediately after the tenant vacated the unit pursuant to a notice of termination or eviction using this subparagraph as the cause for eviction;

 f.

 ((~~i.~~)) 1)  Within ((~~thirty (~~))30((~~)~~)) days after the tenant has vacated, the owner does not list the single-family dwelling unit for sale at a reasonable price with a realty agency or advertise it for sale at a reasonable price in a newspaper of general circulation, or

 ((~~ii.~~))  2)  Within ((~~ninety (~~))90((~~)~~)) days after the date the tenant vacated or the date the property was listed for sale, whichever is later, the owner withdraws the rental unit from the market, rents the unit to someone other than the former tenant, or otherwise indicates that the owner does not intend to sell the unit;

 g. The tenant's occupancy is conditioned upon employment on the property and the employment relationship is terminated;

 ((~~ii.~~))  2)  Two ((~~(2)~~)) months' rent for a tenant household with an income during the past ((~~twelve (~~))12((~~)~~)) months above ((~~fifty (~~))50((~~)~~)) percent of the County median income;

 B. Pursuant to subsection 23.45.510.E, for certain structures in multifamily zones, portions of a story that extend no more than 4 feet above existing or finished grade, whichever is lower, are exempt from calculation of gross floor area. The exempt gross floor area of such partially below- grade stories is measured as follows:

 1. determine the elevation 4 feet ((~~above~~))  below  the finished floor of the story next above the partially below-grade story, or 4 foot ((~~above~~))  below  the roof surface if there is no next floor above the partially below-grade story;

 2. determine the points along the exterior wall of the story where the elevation determined in step 23.86.007.B.1 above intersects the abutting corresponding existing or finished grade elevation, whichever is lower;

 3. draw a straight line across the story connecting the two points on the exterior walls;

 4. the gross floor area of the partially below- grade story or portion of a partially below-grade story is the area of the story that is at or below the straight line drawn in step 23.86.007.B.3 above , excluding openings required by the Building Code for egress.  (See Exhibit B for 23.86.007).
