 PROPERTY USE AND DEVELOPMENT AGREEMENT

 Grantor: 1) Real Estate Investment Properties, LLC

 Grantee: 1) The City of Seattle

 Legal Description:

 See Exhibit A

 Reference Nos. of Documents Released or Assigned: N/A

 THIS PROPERTY USE AND DEVELOPMENT AGREEMENT (the "Agreement") is executed this ____day of __________________, 2010, in favor of the CITY OF SEATTLE, a Washington charter city (the "City"), and REAL ESTATE INVESTMENT PROPERTIES, LLC, a Washington Limited Liability Company (the "Owner").

 RECITALS

 A. The Owner is the owner of that certain real property (the "Property") in the City of Seattle zoned Single Family 5000 ("SF 5000") legally described in Exhibit A attached hereto and incorporated herein by this reference.

 B. On August 7, 2007, the Owner submitted to the City an application for a Contract Rezone, Master Use Permit, and Full Unit Lot Subdivision (MUP No. 3006045), to rezone the Property from SF 5000 to Lowrise 2 ("L2"). The purpose of the application is to allow a 67-unit multi-family townhouse project, with parking for 95 vehicles, to be developed on the Property.

 C. Seattle Municipal Code ("SMC") Section 23.34.004 allows the City to approve a contract rezone subject to "self-imposed restrictions upon the use and development of the property in order to ameliorate adverse impacts that could occur from unrestricted use and development permitted by development regulations otherwise applicable after the rezone."

 NOW THEREFORE, in consideration of the mutual agreements contained herein, the parties agree as follows

 AGREEMENT

 Section 1. Agreement. Pursuant to SMC 23.34.004, the Owner hereby covenants, bargains, and agrees, on behalf of itself and its successors and assigns, that it will comply with the following limitations and conditions in consideration of the rezone of the Property from SF 5000 to L2:

 A. Except as provided below, future development of the Property is restricted to a project that is developed in substantial accordance with the final approved Master Use Permit drawings for MUP Application No. 3006045 dated December 15, 2008 (Hearing Examiner's Exhibit 1, Clerk's File 308906)

 B. As authorized under SMC 23.76.060.B, the contract rezone shall expire seven (7) years after the effective date of the ordinance approving this rezone, provided that if a Master Use Permit is issued, the rezone remains in effect until the Master Use Permit expires. The seven year period is to allow sufficient time to construct all 67 dwelling units authorized under Master Use Permit (MUP) No. 3006045, and to provide sufficient time to complete required right-of-way improvements, as described in MUP No. 3006045 and the Hearing Examiner Decision on the preliminary plat (Hearing Examiner File No. MUP-10-013 (SD)).

 C. The Owner shall construct on-site lighting and signage at each of the proposed trail connections to the Chief Sealth trail, as identified in the Master Use Permit drawings (Hearing Examiner's Exhibit 1). These improvements must be constructed and approved by the Department of Planning and Development prior to the issuance of any building permit for any dwelling unit.

 D. Pursuant to Seattle Municipal Code Section 23.34.004B, the amount of required parking for the project is reduced from the 95 spaces proposed in the Master Use Permit No 3006045 to the amount required for multifamily developments in Lowrise 2 zones located within an urban village when the first application for a building permit for a dwelling unit is submitted to the City.

 Section 2. Agreement Runs With the Land. This Agreement shall be recorded in the records of King County by the City Clerk. The covenants hereof shall be deemed to attach to and run with the Property and shall be binding upon the Owner, its heirs, successors, and assigns, and shall apply to after-acquired title of the Owner of the Property.

 Section 3. Amendment. This Agreement may be amended or modified by written agreement between the Owner and the City, provided that such amendment shall be approved following procedures outlined for amendments to Property Use and Development Agreements in Seattle Municipal Code Section 23.76.058.

 Section 4. Exercise of Police Power. Nothing in this Agreement prevents the City Council from making further amendments to the Seattle Municipal Code or to the Land Use Code as it may deem necessary to the public interest.

 Section 5. No Precedent. The conditions contained in this Agreement are based on the unique circumstances applicable to this Property and this Agreement is not intended to establish precedent for any other rezone.

 Section 6. Benefited. This Agreement is made for the benefit of the City, and the City may institute and prosecute any proceeding at law or in equity to enforce this Agreement.

 Section 7. Repeal as Additional Remedy. Owner acknowledges that compliance with the conditions of this Agreement is a condition of the rezone and that if Owner avails itself of the benefits of this Agreement, but then fails to comply with the requirements of this Agreement, the City may revoke the rezone by ordinance and require the use of the Property to conform to the requirements of the SF 5000 zone.
