 WHEREAS, it is a constitutional requirement, a requirement of Chapter 10.101 RCW and a public purpose that each person charged with a crime punishable by incarceration or involved in certain other proceedings that may result in loss of liberty or loss of fundamental rights, be provided with effective legal representation in order to ensure equal justice under law without regard to ability to pay; and

 WHEREAS, effective legal representation should be provided consistent with the constitutional requirements of fairness, equal protection, and due process in all cases where the right to counsel attaches; and

 WHEREAS, it is the intention of The City of Seattle (City), consistent with Chapter 10.101 RCW and other applicable law, to make such services available in an efficient manner that provides effective representation at reasonable cost to the City; and

 WHEREAS, the Seattle City Council adopted Resolution 27696 on September 28, 1987, adopting a framework and schedule for implementing recommendations contained in the 1987 Public Defender Salary and Caseload Review conducted by City Council staff, which report led to a 1989 City Council Budget Intent Statement establishing a 380 case per- attorney, per-year limit, and conditions leading to those recommendation have not materially changed; and

 WHEREAS, the City Council adopted Ordinance 122602 on December 17, 2007, establishing a process for selecting indigent public defense providers; creating a Request for Proposal (RFP) review panel; setting out standards for those indigent public defense services; establishing contractual requirements for agreements between the City and public defense service providers; requesting that the Seattle City Auditor audit compliance; and repealing Ordinance 122493 and Ordinance 121501; and

 WHEREAS, the City Budget Office (CBO) has managed and annually audited the three public defense contracts, insuring agency contract compliance and the efficient use of City resources; and

 WHEREAS, the CBO review of agency caseload has shown the third agency, NDA, to be significantly under the caseload limit of 380 assigned cases per attorney, per year limit;
