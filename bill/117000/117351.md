 ORDINANCE _________________

 AN ORDINANCE relating to the NE 45th Street Viaduct project; authorizing the Director of the Seattle Department of Transportation to accept, on behalf of the City of Seattle, a Maintenance Easement and Agreement from the University of Washington for the purposes of accessing, maintaining, cleaning, repairing, reconstructing, and replacing a retaining wall supporting the west approach of the NE 45th Street Viaduct; placing the easement under the jurisdiction of the Seattle Department of Transportation; and ratifying and confirming prior acts.

 WHEREAS, the NE 45th Street Viaduct project (the "Project") is part of the City's Bridge Rehabilitation and Replacement project which is funded primarily from the "Bridging the Gap" levy voted on and passed by the citizens of Seattle in November of 2006 and provided for in the City of Seattle's 2011 Adopted Budget; and

 WHEREAS, the NE 45th Street Viaduct (the "Viaduct"), located in the University District, provides a vital link between Interstate 5 and the Laurelhurst neighborhood, and provides east/west connections between the University of Washington, the University District, the University Village Shopping Center, Seattle Children's Hospital, and businesses along Sandpoint Way NE; and

 WHEREAS, since the Viaduct was built in 1938, sections of it have been replaced and it has been retrofitted, but many sections no longer comply with current City of Seattle structural and seismic design standards, so that the Viaduct is nearing the end of its structural life; and

 WHEREAS, the structurally deficient 468-foot west approach of the Viaduct needs to be replaced to maintain a safe and efficient travel corridor for vehicles, pedestrians, and bicycles; and

 WHEREAS, the current phase of the Project consists of replacing the 468-foot west approach of the Viaduct and evaluating the east approach and main span for seismic retrofit needs, minimizing the need for long-term maintenance and short-term fixes; and

 WHEREAS, to complete the Project and maintain the Viaduct, the Seattle Department of Transportation must obtain an easement from the University of Washington in order to access a retaining wall that supports the 468-foot west approach of the Viaduct; NOW, THEREFORE,
