 AN ORDINANCE relating to Seattle Public Utilities; authorizing the Director of Seattle Public Utilities to enter into long-term, full and partial requirements contracts and emergency intertie agreements with wholesale customers that have expiring water supply contracts with Seattle, and ratifying and confirming certain prior acts.

 WHEREAS, Seattle serves 11 cities and water utilities under long-term full and partial requirements contracts for water supply that were authorized in 2001 by Ordinance 120362; and

 WHEREAS, eight cities and water utilities remained under long- term water supply contracts signed in 1982, or similar contracts, which expire January 1, 2012; and

 WHEREAS, Seattle has completed negotiations with six of the cities and water utilities, including Water Districts 49, 90, and 119, and the cities of Bothell, Duvall, and Renton for long-term full or partial requirement contracts, that are substantially similar to the existing full and partial requirements contracts authorized by Ordinance 120362, which will make for consistent and easier wholesale customer contract management; and

 WHEREAS, the six cities and water utilities entering into these full and partial requirements contracts will become members of the existing Operating Board for the Seattle Regional Water Supply System and be subject to the same provisions as the existing full and partial contract holders including, the same cost allocation and rate- making principles and procedures, participation in the regional conservation program, a contract expiration date of January 1, 2062, and opportunities to amend the contract in 2021 and 2041; and

 WHEREAS, Seattle and the City of Renton have negotiated alternative provisions to a partial requirements contract to handle unique circumstances for providing regional conservation services and new supply to their entire retail service area even though the City of Renton supplies most of its retail service area with its own independent sources of supply; and

 WHEREAS, Seattle has also completed negotiations with the remaining two entities, including the City of Edmonds and the Lake Forest Park Water District for long-term emergency intertie agreements since their requirements for future water supply from Seattle are limited to emergency purposes; NOW, THEREFORE,

 BE IT ORDAINED BY THE CITY OF SEATTLE AS FOLLOWS:

 Section 1. The Director of Seattle Public Utilities is hereby authorized to enter into long-term full requirements contracts with Water Districts 49 and 119 and the cities of Bothell and Duvall, and long-term partial requirements contracts with Water District 90 and the City of Renton, substantially in the form of the contract attached to this ordinance as Attachment A, including any changes the Director deems necessary and that are consistent with the purposes of this ordinance, including provisions in the partial requirements contract with the City of Renton to include an alternative cost recovery mechanism to recover costs for providing regional conservation services or other new supply to the City of Renton in lieu of facilities charges or new supply rates.

 FULL [PARTIAL] REQUIREMENTS CONTRACT

 BETWEEN

 THE CITY OF SEATTLE

 AND

 ____________ WATER DISTRICT [CITY of _____________ ]

 FOR THE SUPPLY OF WATER

 THIS CONTRACT is entered into between the CITY OF SEATTLE ("Seattle"), a municipal corporation of the State of Washington, and __________________ ("Water Utility"), a municipal corporation of the State of Washington.

 RECITALS

 1. Seattle owns and operates a system for the supply, transmission, and distribution of potable water and is authorized to sell and distribute water to its residents and to other persons and customers located outside the corporate limits of Seattle.

 2. Seattle's water system is integral to the health and welfare of the residents located within the water service area shown in Seattle's Water System Plan. Seattle intends to provide water from the system to meet the current and future needs of the residents of such water service area when such service is requested from Seattle.

 3. In meeting this service commitment, Seattle must ensure that this role does not place financial burdens on its retail customers for which they do not receive a corresponding benefit.

 b.  Seattle' s Right to Amend . If the parties are unable to agree on a proposal by Seattle pursuant to subsection a above within the respective one-year periods, Seattle may propose in writing its desired amendment to the Operating Board. Seattle and the Operating Board shall meet and consider the proposed amendment and use reasonable efforts to resolve any differences in the proposal. After 90 days from Seattle's written proposal to the Board, Seattle may propose its desired amendment to the Seattle City Council. If the Operating Board does not agree with such proposal, it may submit a revised proposal to the Seattle City Council within 90 days of Seattle's submission of its proposal to the Seattle City Council. After receiving the Operating Board's alternate proposal, or after the lapse of the 90 day period for the Operating Board to make an alternate proposal, the Seattle City Council may then deny both proposals or approve one of them and issue an amendment to this contract which shall be in effect for the remaining term of the contract from the date of issuance, unless later amended pursuant to subsection a above, or by mutual agreement.

 II.B. Agreement to Supply and Purchase Water

 1.  Full Requirements Commitment . Seattle shall supply the Full Water Requirements of Water Utility for the term of this contract. Except as set forth in Exhibit I and section II.B.5 below, Water Utility shall purchase its Full Water Requirements from Seattle.

 [Partial Requirements Commitment . Seattle shall supply the Partial Water Requirements of Water Utility for the term of this contract. Except as set forth in Exhibits I and XIII and Section II.B.5 below, Water Utility shall purchase its Partial Water Requirements from Seattle.]

 2.  Adjustments in Water Utility's Service Area . In the event Water Utility acquires additional service area that is: 1) located outside of the service area identified in Exhibit X and 2) which is not already served with water from the Seattle Regional Water Supply System, then Seattle shall supply the Full or Partial Water Requirements, as appropriate, of the additional service area subject to a) the availability of water in the Seattle Regional Water Supply System determined on the same basis as would be applied to determine the availability of water for new or expanded wholesale service customers of Seattle; b) the limitation of geographical boundaries in Seattle's water rights claims or permits; and c) Water Utility's payment of Facilities Charges ("FCs") for that additional service area in accordance with section IV.E.

 3.  Assumption or Transfer of Responsibilities . In the event Water Utility's entire service area and service responsibilities are assumed by or are transferred to another utility or utilities, then this contract shall become null and void at the time the assumption or transfer becomes effective; provided, however, if the transferee of the service area is a Wholesale Customer, Seattle shall provide water to the transferee according to the terms of the transferee's water supply contract with Seattle. If the transferee is not a Wholesale Customer, then Seattle shall issue the transferee a water supply contract for such area subject to terms and conditions as Seattle shall determine.

 4.  Annexation by Seattle . If the entire service area of Water Utility is annexed to Seattle, then this contract shall become null and void upon the effective date of Seattle's assumption of Water Utility's water system.

 5.  Water Utility's Right to Terminate or Reduce Purchase Commitment . Water Utility's commitment to purchase water from Seattle under this contract may be terminated or reduced subject to the terms and conditions set forth below. Water Utility shall provide Seattle at least 5 years written notice of termination or reduction, provided, however, if Seattle unilaterally amends the terms and conditions of this contract pursuant to Section II.A.3 above, Water Utility may terminate this contract at any time within 1 year thereafter by giving Seattle 1 year written notice.

 a.  Automatically Permitted Reductions . Water Utility may, without restriction, upon five years written notice to Seattle, reduce its water purchases from Seattle by an amount not to exceed 10 million gallons per day ("MGD") of its average annual demand.

 b.  Reductions Requiring Permission . Water Utility may reduce quantities of water purchased from Seattle by more than 10 MGD or by providing less than five years advance notice of such reduction if in the judgment of the Operating Board, using the criteria listed below, it determines that such reduction is in the best interest of the Seattle Regional Water Supply System as a whole.

 c.  Criteria . The criteria to be used by the Operating Board in determining the best interest of the Seattle Regional Water Supply System shall include but not be limited to the following:

 i. The potential for Stranded Costs and impacts on rates to either the remaining Wholesale Customers or Seattle;

 ii. The cost of new resources;

 iii. The feasibility and benefit of reallocating to Seattle or other customers the amount of water foregone by Water Utility; and

 iv. Environmental aspects of the proposed change.

 The Operating Board shall act promptly and reasonably in evaluating and deciding upon Water Utility's request. The Operating Board may approve, with or without reasonable conditions, or deny Water Utility's request based on the above criteria. Approval conditions may include a requirement that Water Utility waive its rights to be served its Full Water Requirements. If the approval conditions are unacceptable to Water Utility, it may elect in writing to withdraw its request and this contract shall continue in full force and effect.

 II.C. Continuity of Service within the Term of the Contract

 1.  Parity of Service . Seattle shall provide wholesale water to Water Utility at an equivalent Wholesale Level of Service that it provides to itself. In the event of a general emergency or weather-related water shortage affecting the entire Seattle Regional Water Supply System, general restrictions placed upon water deliveries to Water Utility shall be determined by the Operating Board and applied consistently to other Wholesale Customers and the Seattle Retail Distribution System. In the event of localized emergency problems, Water Utility acknowledges temporary, localized service interruptions may occur for the duration of the emergency.

 2.  Emergency Curtailment Measures . It is recognized by both parties that emergency water use curtailment measures may have to be adopted by Seattle to implement on a regional basis in order to meet an emergency condition or a regional water shortage. The procedures to be used in the event of a weather-related regional water shortage, or shortages caused by other emergency factors, shall be as described in Seattle's Water Shortage Contingency Plan in effect as of the effective date of this contract, or successor contingency plans. Successor water shortage contingency plans shall be developed and implemented by Seattle in consultation with the Operating Board. Water Utility shall assist with and support all procedures or emergency curtailment measures that are implemented under the Water Shortage Contingency Plan, or its successor.

 3.  Other Emergencies . Seattle may temporarily interrupt or reduce deliveries of water to Water Utility if Seattle determines that such interruption or reduction is necessary or reasonable in case of system emergencies or in order to install equipment, make repairs, replacements, investigations and inspections or perform other maintenance work on the Seattle Regional Water Supply System. Except in cases of emergency, and in order that Water Utility's operations will not be unreasonably interrupted, Seattle shall give Water Utility and the Operating Board reasonable notice of any such interruption or reduction, the reasons for and the probable duration. Seattle shall use its best efforts to minimize service interruptions to Water Utility.

 4.  Waiver Of Charges . If interruption or reduction in deliveries of water to Water Utility requires that Water Utility draw water supply in a manner that subjects Water Utility to demand charges (as described in Exhibit III hereto), Seattle shall waive such charges during the period of such interruption or reduction.

 II.D. Water Quality

 1.  Seattle Regional Water Supply System . Seattle shall be responsible for water quality within the Seattle Regional Water Supply System as set forth below. Seattle shall construct, operate and maintain water quality treatment facilities and use its best efforts to carry out its water quality responsibilities in the most cost- effective manner for the region.

 2.  Applicable Standards . Seattle shall at all times during the term hereof deliver water to Water Utility's system that meets or exceeds all applicable Federal, State and local regulations as the same may change from time to time.

 3.  System-wide Water Quality Plan . Seattle, in consultation with the Operating Board, may develop and maintain a system-wide regional water quality plan. The plan shall describe, at a minimum, goals, objectives, procedures and the means to satisfy legal requirements and industry standards for water quality, monitoring, information exchange, best management practices, adaptive management practices, public health protection, and cross connection control. The Operating Board may form a technical subcommittee to provide input and review of such plan. Seattle shall share available water quality data and technical expertise with all Wholesale Customers.

 4.  Distribution Systems . Water Utility shall be responsible for compliance with all applicable federal, State and local water quality laws and regulations applicable to water in its distribution system including any water from its own supply sources.

 5.  Monitoring . Water quality monitoring shall be performed by Seattle in the Seattle Regional Water Supply System and by Water Utility in its distribution system to comply with federal, State and local water quality regulations, to verify the condition of water that is passing from one entity to the other, to enhance system operation and to document the aesthetic qualities of the water. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Water Utility may contract with Seattle for water quality monitoring services as an elective service under section IV.F. hereof.

 6.  Water Quality Notifications to Customers (Consumer Confidence Reports) . Each party shall prepare at its sole cost periodic water quality notifications to its respective retail customers and regulatory agencies as required by law. Seattle shall provide Water Utility all water quality data in a timely manner regarding the Seattle Regional Water Supply System that Water Utility may be legally required to report in such notices.

 7.  Water Quality Best Management Practices and Adaptive Management Practices . The Operating Board may develop best management practices ("BMPs") and adaptive management practices ("AMPs") as reasonably necessary to protect water quality within the Seattle Regional Water Supply System. The BMPs and AMPs will include recommendations to prevent deterioration of water quality in transmission and distribution systems. The parties shall use reasonable efforts to comply with the BMPs and AMPs.

 8.  Flushing . Water Utility shall be solely responsible for flushing water mains within its system. Flushing allowances will be provided by Seattle only when the Operating Board determines that flushing is required to maintain or improve regional water quality.

 9.  New Water Sources . Prior to the introduction of any new water supply source, including any direct or indirect potable reuse water, by Water Utility which mixes with water in the Seattle Regional Water Supply System, the proposed source must be evaluated using customary and reasonable water quality criteria developed in consultation with the Operating Board to ensure compatibility with Seattle water and approved in writing by Seattle. The proposed Water Utility source must also meet all federal, state and Seattle water quality and treatment standards. Upon Seattle's request, Water Utility shall also provide Seattle with satisfactory results from a blending study to determine the compatibility of the source with existing sources already in the Seattle Regional Water Supply System, the appropriate method and level of treatment and the probable distribution of the new supply within the Seattle Regional Water Supply System. Water Utility shall also complete a flavor rating analysis of no more than 3.0 as tested by Seattle's flavor profile panel according to the methodology described by the American Water Works Association, or its successor. Water Utility shall obtain all necessary and appropriate regulatory permits, reviews, and approvals for rights to and operational use of such water supply source.

 The Operating Board may form a technical subcommittee to develop water quality standards and review and advise on the water quality evaluation criteria for proposed new sources. Such criteria for new sources shall be the same for surface water and ground water.

 10.  Transfers Outside the Seattle Regional Water Supply System . If, with the written consent of Seattle, water from the Seattle Regional Water Supply System is transferred between Water Utility and another water utility in a manner that does not use the Seattle Regional Water Supply System, Water Utility, the other water utility, or both, shall be fully responsible for meeting all applicable water quality standards related to the transfer of such water between their respective systems. Seattle will not be responsible for water quality outside of the Seattle Regional Water Supply System or Seattle Retail Distribution System except as may be agreed to under Section II.D.5.

 II.E. Conservation

 The parties acknowledge that conservation prolongs the time before new supply resources are needed and thus constitutes an important ongoing tool in managing the water resources of the region. Accordingly, Water Utility hereby adopts and agrees to be bound by the Regional Water Conservation Program, as it may be amended from time to time during the term of this contract. In accordance with Part 1, Section B.1.5 of the Settlement Agreement between the Muckleshoot Indian Tribe and the National Marine Fisheries Services and the City of Seattle (Civ. No. 03-3775JLR), Water Utility will implement, through its participation in the Regional Water Conservation Program, conservation measures that are substantially similar to those implemented by Seattle within the Seattle Retail Distribution System.

 1.  Performance Measurements . For the purposes of determining water conservation performance, Water Utility's water use shall be measured in conjunction with the use of all other participants in the Regional Water Conservation Program. The Operating Board may develop reasonable criteria to measure the participants' water conservation performance in accordance with such program.

 2.  Conservation Above the Regional Water Conservation Program . Water Utility acknowledges that water conservation beyond the Regional Water Conservation Program may be required as a condition of State or federal regulations, court orders, settlements or agreements made to avoid litigation, fines or penalties, or as otherwise determined to be reasonably necessary by the Operating Board. The Operating Board may adopt reasonable additional conservation measures and targets for such purposes. Such conservation measures and targets shall apply in the same manner to all holders of Full and Partial Requirements Contracts and the Seattle Retail Distribution System. Except as provided in the next subsection, Water Utility shall implement such additional water conservation measures and meet the additional adopted targets.

 3.  Water Utility's Option to be Conservation Service Provider . Water Utility may elect to provide its own water conservation program, beyond its commitment to the Regional Water Conservation Program to meet conservation targets adopted by the Operating Board, or more stringent targets. Water Utility shall bear the additional costs thereof and shall be solely responsible for its implementation. Under this option, Water Utility shall be evaluated for meeting the additional water conservation targets solely by its own performance.

 4.  Incentives and Penalties . The Operating Board may adopt penalties for shortfalls in water conservation and rewards for meeting or exceeding adopted targets. In the event Water Utility or Seattle fails to meet the adopted targets set by the Operating Board, the Operating Board may assess a penalty. Penalties may not exceed the cost of Seattle undertaking those conservation measures reasonably needed to achieve the adopted target.

 5.  Postponing the Need for New Water Supply Facilities . In order to avoid the necessity of developing new physical water supply facilities for as long as reasonably practicable, any water saved through conservation in either Seattle's or Water Utility's retail service areas shall be dedicated first to the municipal and industrial water supply requirements of the Seattle Regional Water Supply System before any other use of such water may be undertaken.

 SECTION III. CONDITIONS OF SERVICE

 III.A. Minimum Hydraulic Gradient

 1.  Initial Minimum . Seattle shall maintain a minimum hydraulic gradient or head at a maximum flow rate in amounts and at locations described in Exhibit II attached hereto for each Service Connection from the Seattle Regional Water Supply System to Water Utility's distribution system. Such gradients and locations shall be contained in Seattle's and Water Utility's future water system plans. Seattle shall operate and maintain the Seattle Transmission Facilities necessary to carry out such obligation. If Seattle and the Operating Board find that a project resulting in the modification of such minimum gradient or head would benefit the Seattle Regional Water Supply System as a whole, the minimum hydraulic gradient or head described in Exhibit II may be modified by Seattle if such modification is feasible from an economic, land use and engineering perspective taking into account the facilities required to carry out and for Water Utility to adapt to such modification. Seattle may make these modifications only once during any fifteen (15) year period provided that four (4) years advance written notice is given to Water Utility, unless a shorter notice is approved by the Operating Board.

 2.  Emergencies . If Seattle is prevented by emergency circumstances from providing such minimum hydraulic gradient, Seattle shall supply not less than the volume of water equivalent to the maximum 24-hour average flow rate required by Water Utility as shown on Exhibit II for each 24 hour period that the minimum hydraulic gradient is interrupted.

 3.  Additional Service Connections . Additional Service Connections between Water Utility's and Seattle Regional Water Supply System's water systems or adjusted minimum gradients may be established from time to time by mutual agreement between Seattle and Water Utility subject to approval by the Operating Board. Exhibit II shall be appropriately revised to reflect such additions or adjustments.

 III.B. Resale to Other Parties

 Water Utility may sell water supplied by Seattle to other water utilities located outside of Water Utility's existing or future service area only upon the prior written consent of Seattle (or oral, in case of emergency). Agreements for resale of water by Water Utility listed in Exhibit I are hereby approved by Seattle subject to whatever written terms, conditions and limitations that Seattle has imposed on such resale.

 III.C. Interconnection With Other Systems

 1.  Prohibition on Interconnection . Water Utility shall not interconnect any part of its system supplied with water from Seattle with other water systems without the prior written approval of the Operating Board, or, in case of emergency, upon oral approval by Seattle, which shall not be unreasonably withheld. Any such interconnection shall be subject to the approval of the Washington State Department of Health and the installation of a meter. Such other systems must be in compliance with all applicable local, State and federal laws and regulations including the requirement that they have a valid operating permit issued by the Washington State Department of Health.

 2.  Requests by Seattle to Interconnect . Seattle may request that Water Utility interconnect its water system to the water system of an adjacent Wholesale Customer. Water Utility shall comply with that request subject to the terms and conditions set forth below.

 a.  Requirement for Interconnection . If Water Utility does not consent to Seattle's request for interconnection, Seattle may propose the interconnection of Water Utility's water system to the adjacent Wholesale Customer to the Operating Board. Water Utility may present facts and arguments to the Operating Board in opposition to the interconnection and document its costs in making the interconnection and conveying water to the adjacent Wholesale Customer. The Operating Board shall hear and consider the matter. Upon (a) a written finding by the Operating Board that the proposed interconnection with an adjacent Wholesale Customer is feasible taking into account Water Utility's capabilities, limitations, and obligations, (b) a written finding by the Operating Board that such interconnection benefits the Seattle Regional Water Supply System and (c) a written demand of the Operating Board that Water Utility carry out the interconnection, Water Utility shall be required to interconnect its facilities to the adjacent Wholesale Customer for the purpose of supplying water to that Wholesale Customer through the distribution system of Water Utility, provided that the adjacent Wholesale Customer agrees to perform the interconnection in a location and according to a schedule which does not unduly disrupt Water Utility's operations, and to be responsible for the payment and indemnity obligations in Section III.C.2.b below.

 b.  Payment and Indemnity . Water Utility shall be paid its actual costs of providing such interconnection and water transmission service by the adjacent Wholesale Customer receiving the water, plus a reasonable amount for overhead, administration and rate of return (equal to Rate of Return on Investment) on such costs, and Water Utility shall be indemnified from any liability that may result from providing such interconnection by the adjacent Wholesale Customer. The Operating Board shall adopt a standard methodology for calculating costs that ensures that Water Utility is fairly compensated for such service.

 III.D. Development of Regional Supply and Transmission Infrastructure

 Final decisions and authority to approve construction of capital infrastructure related to the Seattle Regional Water Supply System shall rest with the Seattle City Council. Capital construction activities include, but are not limited to installations, renewals, replacements, upgrades, expansions, and any other costs included in Seattle's comprehensive capital facilities plan.

 III.E. Metering Equipment

 Seattle shall own and perform testing, cleaning and recalibration on appropriate metering devices and associated appurtenances to measure the amount of water delivered to Water Utility at the Service Connection pursuant to this contract. Seattle shall perform all other work at Water Utility's expense regardless of the cause provided that the cause is consistent with AWWA and safety standards and practices. Water Utility shall operate and maintain its water system in a manner that the water flowing through the Service Connection meter operates within the normal operating range for the meter as specified by the manufacturer.

 Until such time as Seattle determines it to be economical to install metering devices to measure the amount of water delivered from the Seattle Regional Water Supply System to the Seattle Retail Distribution System, the amount of water delivered to the Seattle Retail Distribution System shall be measured indirectly by subtracting the metered water delivered to all of Seattle's wholesale customers from 98% of the total amount of water exiting Seattle's sources of supply as measured by the supply meters.

 SECTION IV. COST OF WATER SUPPLY & TRANSMISSION

 Cost-based rates are a water industry accepted practice and the historical practice of Seattle and the Wholesale Customers. The rate-making principles, policies and methodologies set forth in this Section IV are intended to meet the objective of equitable and cost-based rates.

 IV.A. Rate-making and Cost-allocation Principles

 The parties will apply the following general principles and policies to the establishment of all rates, charges, and cost allocations for water supply, transmission, and related services under this contract.

 1. No expenses attributable to electric power development may be allocated to the cost pools identified herein unless the pools are allocated a commensurate share of revenue derived from such development.

 2. Seattle shall utilize generally accepted accounting principles, as may be amended from time to time, consistently applied as a basis for developing the financial information upon which rates and charges are based.

 3. Abrupt changes in financial policies should be avoided.

 4. The rate structure should encourage the efficient use of water, conservation and the timely development of new environmentally responsible water sources and should incorporate seasonal rates and other pricing approaches to encourage efficient use.

 5. The rate structure should be innovative, flexible and adaptive whenever it is cost effective and beneficial in furthering the rate-making policies.

 6. The rate structure should be simple to administer and easily understandable.

 7. The rate structure should be fair and equitable while balancing the needs of all parties.

 8. Capital costs which benefit only a new Wholesale Customer shall be allocated to that customer and not to any cost pool described in this contract.

 9. Capital costs associated with improvements or facilities which benefit or serve individual Wholesale Customers or the Seattle Retail Distribution System may be allocated to a sub-regional or regional cost pool to the extent necessary to alleviate a disproportionate adverse impact to that Wholesale Customer or the Seattle Retail Distribution System from a regional or sub- regional capital improvement and where (i) such impact could have been reasonably avoided through a different project design, or (ii) the other Wholesale Customers, including the Seattle Retail Distribution System, receive tangible benefits, directly or indirectly, from the adopted capital facilities plan.

 10. The Seattle Retail Distribution System shall be treated as the equivalent of a Wholesale Customer of the Seattle Regional Water Supply System for the purpose of charging Seattle the same wholesale rates and charges as Water Utility for water supply and transmission. Costs calculated under the costs pools described below shall apply to all Wholesale Customers and to the Seattle Retail Distribution System.

 11. The allocation of costs associated with capital construction activities within the Seattle Regional Water Supply System shall be the responsibility of the Operating Board. The Operating Board shall use its best efforts to determine and approve a cost allocation method for infrastructure projects prior to the capital project obtaining construction approval from the Seattle City Council. Failure of the Operating Board to determine and approve a cost allocation method shall not hinder the Seattle City Council from approving capital infrastructure projects in order to assure Seattle's ability to fulfill the requirements of this contract.

 12. All parties will use best efforts in establishing rates and cost allocations that reflect the rate-making and cost allocation principles set forth in this Section IV.A.

 IV.B. Ratemaking Framework

 Subject to the foregoing principles, wholesale rates and charges for the services described in this contract shall be developed by Seattle based on the following framework:

 1.  Water Supply and Transmission Service . The costs of water supply and transmission of water shall be accounted for separately in the water supply and transmission cost pools described below. The price for each service shall be recovered through separate rates for each service. All direct costs incurred in providing water supply and transmission services shall be allocated to the appropriate cost pool and recovered through the rates for each service. In addition, certain indirect costs consisting of a reasonable overhead and administration cost shall be allocated to the appropriate cost pool and recovered through rates for each service.

 2.  Water Supply - Basic and Elective Services . The costs of supplying water falls into two categories -- basic and elective services. Basic service costs include direct and indirect costs attributable to the delivery of water to the Wholesale Customers and to Seattle's Retail Distribution System pursuant to the foregoing principles. Elective services are optional services, such as water quality laboratory services and specific engineering support that Seattle makes available.

 3.  Conservation . Costs incurred by Seattle for the Regional Water Conservation Program shall be allocated to the New Supply Cost Pool and the Operating Board will determine to recover those costs either through rates or Facility Charges "FCs" from Wholesale Customers and Seattle.

 IV.C. Water Supply Pricing -- Basic Services

 1.  Two Water Supply Cost Pools . For the purposes of determining costs of water supply, there shall be two cost pools: An existing supply cost pool ("Existing Supply Cost Pool") and a new supply cost pool (" New Supply Cost Pool").

 a.  Existing Supply Cost Pool . The Existing Supply Cost Pool shall be accounted for as follows:

 i. A basic services rate for water supply shall be charged to recover the full costs of operating, maintaining, repairing, renewing and replacing the Existing Supply Resources incurred by Seattle.

 ii. All regional conservation programs undertaken by Seattle prior to January 1, 2002, shall be considered an Existing Supply Resource cost.

 iii. Renewal and replacement of Existing Supply Resources will be an Existing Supply Resource cost.

 b.  New Supply Cost Pool . The New Supply Cost Pool shall be accounted for as follows:

 i. Water supply resources developed after January 1, 2002 that expand the capacity of the Seattle Regional Water Supply System ("New Supply Resources"), including the costs of the Regional Water Conservation Program from January 1, 2002, shall be included in the New Supply Cost Pool. If any portion of a New Supply Resource project enhances reliability of Existing Supply Resources, the costs thereof may be allocated to the Existing Supply Cost Pool if the Operating Board and Seattle both agree.

 ii. The cost of New Supply Resources plus Rate of Return on Investment may be recovered either through FCs or new supply rates charged to the holders of Full and Partial Requirements Contracts and the Seattle Retail Distribution System. The new supply rate shall be applied to all holders of Full and Partial Requirements Contracts and the Seattle Retail Distribution System.

 iii. The Operating Board shall determine the portion of the New Supply Resource costs that shall be recovered through FCs or through new supply rates. The FCs and new supply rates may be scalable to create an incentive for developers to build housing or commercial units with efficient water usage levels. Water Utility, as well as each other Wholesale Customer and Seattle in setting rates for retail customers shall be free to choose the method of incorporating FCs or new supply rates into their own retail rates and charges.

 iv. Holders of Full and Partial Requirements Contracts who have not purchased water from Seattle under the 1982 Water Purveyor Contract shall be assessed the full marginal costs of the operation, including Rate of Return on Investment, of the New Supply Resources. This assessment may be satisfied by either paying FCs and new supply rates or arranging a special water supply rate in lieu of paying FCs.

 c.  Emergency Surcharge . In the event of a drought, catastrophe, or other extraordinary condition that requires emergency expenditures to maintain a sufficient water supply, Seattle may impose an emergency surcharge on all holders of Full and Partial Requirements Contracts in order to pay for such expenditures or maintain financial stability of the Seattle Regional Water Supply System, or both. Any such emergency surcharge shall be presented to the Operating Board prior to adoption by the Seattle City Council. Seattle shall consider the comments of the Operating Board but shall nevertheless have the full authority to adopt the emergency surcharge.

 IV.D. Transmission Pricing - Basic Services

 1.  Transmission Costs Pools . For purposes of determining the cost of the transmission of water to the Wholesale Customers there shall be two [three if subregional pool applies] transmission cost pools consisting of an existing transmission cost pool ("Existing Transmission Cost Pool") and a new transmission cost pool ("New Transmission Cost Pool").

 a.  Existing Transmission Cost Pool . Costs to be allocated to the Existing Transmission Cost Pool shall consist of the following: operation, maintenance, repairs, renewals, and replacements to the Seattle Transmission Facilities.

 i. The Seattle Transmission Facilities are owned and operated as a regional network by Seattle to convey water to wholesale customers and to the Seattle Retail Distribution System. Therefore, the price of transmission for water transmitted within the Seattle Transmission Facilities shall be calculated on the same basis to holders of Full and Partial Requirements Contracts and the Seattle Retail Distribution System.

 ii. Costs incurred for purposes of transmission reliability may be included in the Existing Transmission Cost Pool subject to the approval of the Operating Board and Seattle.

 b.  New Transmission Cost Pool . The cost of new transmission facilities shall be included in the New Transmission Cost Pool. The renewal, replacement, upgrade, expansion, or modification of existing Seattle Transmission Facilities which create an expansion of transmission capacity may be allocated to the New Transmission Cost Pool. The Operating Board shall decide what portion of costs of renewal, replacement, upgrade, expansion or modification of existing Seattle Transmission Facilities may be allocated to the New Transmission Cost Pool and what portion of costs of a transmission project that extends the geographic extent of the transmission system that shall be allocated to the New Transmission Cost Pool or recovered from a new Wholesale Customer if the project benefits only that new Wholesale Customer. Except for costs allocated to a specific Wholesale Customer, New Transmission Cost Pool costs shall be recovered through new transmission rates or FCs as determined by the Operating Board. The new transmission rate shall be applied in a uniform manner to all holders of Full and Partial Requirements Contracts and the Seattle Retail Distribution System.

 c.  [_____________ Sub-regional Cost Pool . Water Utility is served, in part, by the sub- regional water transmission facilities listed in Exhibit XI. The costs of operating, maintaining, repairing and replacing these facilities shall be included in the __________ Sub-regional Cost Pool, together with any other costs Water Utility and Seattle agree to include.]

 2.  Demand Charge

 a. Seattle may adopt a demand charge in accordance with the methodology described in Exhibit III. The demand charge rate (i.e., dollars per 1000 gallons of deficient storage) shall be based on the equivalent cost of providing the deficient storage.

 b. The proceeds of the demand charge will be treated in rate setting as a credit to the New Transmission Cost Pool.

 c. Seattle shall suspend the demand charge rate in the event of emergencies and unforeseen conditions.

 3.  Cost of New or Changed Service Connection . If Seattle requests a change in the location of the Service Connection to Water Utility for the benefit of the Seattle Regional Water Supply System, then the costs, including any retirement costs of the old Service Connection, shall be included in the appropriate transmission cost pool. If Water Utility requests a new Service Connection or a change in location of an existing Service Connection, then Water Utility shall pay the costs of the new or changed Service Connection, including any retirement costs of the old Service Connection regardless of the cause provided that the cause is consistent with AWWA and safety standards and practices.

 IV.E. Allocation of Costs and Revenues into Cost Pools

 1.  Accounting . Seattle shall maintain a cost accounting system consistent with the provisions of this contract and generally accepted accounting principles, as amended from time to time, consistently applied in developing the financial information for determining the costs of acquisition, construction, repair, renewal, replacement, upgrade, expansion, maintenance, and operation of the facilities in each cost pool.

 a.  Asset Accounts . An asset account shall be maintained for each facility and within that account Seattle shall record the original cost of that facility plus betterments and less retirements.

 b.  Depreciation . Facilities shall be depreciated according to industry-standard water system asset lives and a record of life-to-date depreciation shall be maintained for each facility. No depreciation shall be recorded in the first calendar year of operation of a facility. A full year's depreciation shall be recorded in every subsequent year.

 c.  Net Book Value . The net book value of any facility shall be its original cost plus betterments and less retirements as recorded in its facility asset account, less life-to-date depreciation.

 2.  Infrastructure Costs . Each cost pool shall include the infrastructure costs for its respective facilities, calculated on a utility, cash or other basis depending upon the facility and the cost pool as set forth below.

 a.  Utility Basis . The utility basis shall be used to calculate the infrastructure costs for all Existing Supply Resources and Seattle Transmission Facilities, as well as their replacements and betterments. The utility basis may also be used for New Supply Resources and new transmission facilities in Seattle's discretion. Under the utility basis, the infrastructure cost for a facility in any year shall be the sum of (i) the annual depreciation expense recorded for that facility and (ii) the product of the net book value of that facility and the Rate of Return on Investment.

 At Seattle's discretion, interest costs may be considered current infrastructure costs during the construction of a facility. However, any such interest costs must be considered contributions in aid of construction, and not included in the Net Book Value of the facility for purposes of calculating Utility Basis costs in future years.

 b.  Cash Basis . The cash basis may be used in Seattle's discretion for New Supply Resources and transmission facilities or a portion thereof. Under the cash basis, the infrastructure cost for a facility in any year shall be the actual cash expenditure made by Seattle in that year for either the payment of construction costs or actual principal and interest costs on debt issued to finance its construction. In the event that the depreciation lifetime of the facility is less than the term of the debt issued to finance all or a portion of the facility, debt maturities will be selected such that the construction cost of the facility will be fully amortized at the end of its depreciation lifetime.

 c.  Other Basis . Seattle, with the approval of the Operating Board, may determine one or more other bases on which to calculate infrastructure costs and may apply these bases to facilities in the New Supply and New Transmission Cost Pools. Disposition of any facilities under another basis will be determined at the same time in accordance with Section IV.E.4.

 3.  Operations Costs . The costs of operating the assets assigned to a cost pool shall be included in the cost pool. The annual operations costs of a cost pool shall be the labor, materials, equipment and other direct costs required for the operation, maintenance, and repair of the facilities in that cost pool, together with any net profit or expense from the disposition of facilities in that pool. Operations costs shall include the cost of general and administrative overhead applied in a manner consistent with its application to capital construction projects.

 a.  Existing Supply Operations Costs . The parties agree that an efficient way of handling operations costs for the Existing Supply Cost Pool shall be as follows: The operations cost base in the Existing Supply Cost Pool for the year 2010 shall be determined in accordance with the line item labeled "2010 Costs in identified activities" under Existing Supply in Note 2 -- Operations Costs, Notes to the Wholesale Statements for the City of Seattle, Seattle Public Utilities, Water Fund, during the annual cost-audit process for 2010 in accordance with Section IV.E.10, which occurs by the end of 2011 and applies to all Wholesale Customers and Seattle. Seattle will notify Water Utility of the actual 2010 operations cost base in the Existing Supply Cost Pool in writing, which shall become incorporated as part of this contract at that time. In each succeeding year, the amount of the operations cost base from the previous year shall be adjusted by the percentage increase in the operations cost in the Existing Supply cost centers identified in Exhibit IX, as amended from time to time.

 b.  Existing Transmission Operations Costs . The parties agree that an efficient way of handling operations costs for the Existing Transmission Cost Pool shall be as follows: the operations costs base in the Existing Transmission Cost Pool for the year 2010 shall be determined in accordance with the line item labeled "2010 Costs in identified activities" under Existing Transmission in Note 2 -- Operations Costs, Notes to the Wholesale Statements for the City of Seattle, Seattle Public Utilities, Water Fund, during the annual cost-audit process for 2010 in accordance with Section IV.E.10, which occurs by the end of 2011 and applies to all Wholesale Customers and Seattle. Seattle will notify Water Utility of the actual 2010 operations cost base in the Existing Transmission Cost Pool in writing, which shall become incorporated as part of this contract at that time. In each succeeding year, the amount of the operations cost base from the previous year shall be adjusted by the percentage increase in the operations cost in the Existing Transmission cost centers identified in Exhibit IX, as amended from time to time.

 c.  New Supply Operations Costs . The operation costs of the Regional Water Conservation Program after January 1, 2002, together with the costs of operating facilities assigned to the New Supply Cost Pool and any other costs allocated by the Operating Board, shall be assigned to the New Supply Cost Pool. The operations cost base in the New Supply Cost Pool for 2010 shall be determined in accordance with the line item labeled "2010 Costs in identified activities" under New Supply in Note 2 -- Operations Costs, Notes to the Wholesale Statements for the City of Seattle, Seattle Public Utilities, Water Fund, during the annual cost-audit process for 2010 in accordance with Section IV.E.10, which occurs by the end of 2011 and applies to all Wholesale Customers and Seattle. Seattle will notify Water Utility of the actual 2010 operations cost base in the New Supply Cost Pool in writing, which shall become incorporated as part of this contract at that time. In each succeeding year, the amount of the operations cost base shall be adjusted by the percentage increase in the operations costs in the New Supply cost centers as identified in Exhibit IX, as amended from time to time.

 d.  New Transmission Operations Costs . The actual costs of operating facilities assigned to the New Transmission Cost Pool and any other costs allocated by the Operating Board, shall be assigned to the New Transmission Cost Pool.

 e.  [___________ Sub-regional Operations Costs . The actual costs of operating facilities assigned to the xxxxx Sub-regional Cost Pool, together with any additional operations costs approved by Water Utility and Seattle.]

 4.  Disposition Costs . The costs of disposing of assets within a cost pool shall be included in the cost pool. Net disposition costs shall be calculated as follows:

 a.  Disposition Under the Utility Basis . The net book value of the facility, less any sales, salvage, or other revenues derived from the disposition of that facility.

 b.  Disposition Under the Cash Basis . The value of principal of unpaid maturities of debt used to finance the construction cost of the facility, less any sales, salvage or other revenues derived from the disposition of that facility.

 c.  Disposition Under Other Basis . Disposition of any facilities whose infrastructure costs are calculated on another basis under section IV.E.2.c. above shall be determined by the parties as part of the definition of such other basis.

 5.  Creation of Additional Cost Pools . Seattle, in its discretion, may create additional cost pools to provide equity and flexibility in payment arrangements and the allocation of costs as the Seattle Regional Water Supply System expands to include new infrastructure, operations, and customers. The costs in an additional cost pool, or a portion thereof, may be added to an existing cost pool subject to the consent of the Operating Board if the costs to be allocated satisfy the criteria for allocation to the existing cost pool.

 6.  Facilities Charge Revenues . Supply FC revenues, which consist of those revenues from FCs the Operating Board has determined are to recover a certain portion of New Supply Resources costs, shall offset infrastructure costs in the New Supply Cost Pool. Surpluses and deficits in actual Supply FC revenues over costs to be recovered through the Supply FC shall be carried forward and earn simple interest at Seattle's Average Cost of Debt.

 Any current-year deficit (including any surplus balance available from previous years) shall be paid by rates for the New Supply Cost Pool. New Supply Cost Pool rates shall be discounted by surplus Supply FC revenues until any deficit Supply FC balance is repaid, except the amount of this discount shall not exceed, without the agreement of the Operating Board, twice the maximum annual deficit paid by the rate for the New Supply Cost Pool in any one year.

 In the event that Supply FC surplus balances exceed the Net Book Value of assets whose costs are allocated to the Supply FC, the difference between the Supply FC balance and the Net Book Value of these assets shall be used to discount the rate for the New Supply Cost Pool (and the Supply FC surplus balance shall be reduced by the amount of this discount). The use and accounting for transmission FCs shall be done in a like manner to supply FCs. Seattle and Water Utility agree that FC revenues are the sole property of Seattle.

 7.  Allocation of Cost Pools by Customer Class . The costs in cost pools shall be allocated within the pools as follows:

 a.  Allocation of Existing Supply Cost Pool . The total cost of the Existing Supply Cost Pool shall be allocated to two customer classes as follows:

 i.  Block Purchase Customer Class . The portion of costs in the Existing Supply Cost Pool allocated to holders of Block Purchase Contracts shall be determined pursuant to those contracts.

 ii.  Full and Partial Requirements Customer Class . The holders of Full and Partial Requirements Contracts and the Seattle Retail Distribution System shall be allocated the remaining costs in the Existing Supply Cost Pool.

 b.  Allocation of New Supply Cost Pool . The costs allocated to the New Supply Cost Pool shall be:

 i.  Block Purchase Customer Class . The holders of Block Purchase Contracts shall be allocated no costs from the New Supply Cost Pool.

 ii  Full and Partial Requirements Customer Class . The holders of Full and Partial Requirements Contracts and the Seattle Retail Distribution System shall be allocated all costs in the New Supply Cost Pool.

 c.  Allocation of Existing Transmission Cost Pool . The costs of the Existing Transmission Cost Pool shall be allocated as follows:

 i.  Block Purchase Customer Class . The proportion of costs in the Existing Transmission Cost Pool allocated to holders of Block Purchase Contracts shall be determined pursuant to those contracts.

 ii  Full and Partial Requirements Customer Class . The holders of Full and Partial Requirements Contracts and the Seattle Retail Distribution System shall be allocated the remaining costs in the Existing Transmission Cost Pool.

 d.  Allocation of New Transmission Cost Pool .

 i.  Block Purchase Customer Class . The holders of Block Purchase Contracts shall be allocated no costs from the New Transmission Cost Pool.

 ii  Full and Partial Requirements Customer Class . The holders of Full and Partial Requirements Contracts and the Seattle Retail Distribution System shall be allocated all costs in the New Supply Cost Pool.

 e.  Allocation of Additional Cost Pools . At the time an additional cost pool is created by Seattle pursuant to Section IV.E.5, the additional cost pool will be allocated by customer class.

 If Applicable:

 f.  [Allocation of ________ Sub-region Cost Pool . All costs in the _______ Sub-regional Cost Pool shall be allocated according to Exhibit XII.]

 8.  Facilities Charges . If Seattle establishes FCs as authorized herein, then such charges shall be calculated as follows:

 a.  ERU Definition . Seattle shall develop a definition of an Equivalent Residential Unit ("ERU") based on, meter size as set forth in Exhibit VI, number of residential units, water use, or other basis which shall be consistent with accepted industry standards. The Operating Board shall have the right to review and comment on the definition and Seattle shall consider the Operating Board's comments.

 b.  Record-Keeping . Water Utility shall provide Seattle with an annual accounting, in a form acceptable to Seattle, of its retail water service connections by January 31st of each year, which shall be accurate as of December 31st of the preceding year. Water Utility shall report the size of the meter and other pertinent data such as the number of residential units or square footage served or water use. Seattle shall provide Wholesale Customers with an annual accounting of its retail service connections on the same basis. Upon reasonable notice, Water Utility shall make its billing and connection records available to Seattle for inspection and copying during normal business hours and Seattle's billing and connection records shall be made available to any Wholesale Customer on the same basis.

 c.  Annual Calculation of ERU's . Until such time as Seattle develops another basis, the calculation of ERU's in any year shall be the annual growth in the number of meters installed by Water Utility during the year taking into account the size of each meter.

 d.  Imposition of Facilities Charges . Seattle shall collect and Water Utility shall pay FCs based on the following:

 i. the number of ERU's added during the previous month determined by the number of meters installed. Seattle shall pay FCs into the accounts of the Seattle Regional Water Supply System on the same basis.

 ii. Seattle Report on ERUs. Seattle shall prepare and distribute a report no later than March 31st of each year showing the ERU count of the Seattle Retail Distribution System and each Wholesale Customer on such basis for the previous year and each year since the effective date of this contract.

 i. [ Growth Allowance for Independent Sources . Water Utility operates the sources of water supply independent of the Seattle Regional Water Supply System listed in Exhibits I and XII. These sources of independent supply are sufficient to serve an additional ____ ERUs within Water Utility's service area, and Water Utility shall have a growth allowance (the "Allowance") for these ____ ERUs as of the effective date of this contract. The Allowance shall be a credit against growth in ERUs within Water Utility's service area.

 ii.  Increase in Allowance for New Independent Sources or Improvement of Existing Sources . Water Utility may develop new sources of independent supply in addition to those listed in Exhibits I and XIII or make improvements in the existing sources of supply in Exhibits I and XIII to increase the yield of those sources, and shall provide Seattle with six months written notice before placing each such additional source or yield improvement into production. However, this provision shall in no way relieve Water Utility from the restrictions on reducing Water Utility's purchase commitment under Section II.B.5 of this contract. Water Utility shall maintain records of the monthly production of each independent source of supply in a manner consistent with industry standards, and shall allow Seattle, upon reasonable notice, to examine and copy these records at their customary location during normal business hours. The Allowance shall be adjusted as follows for each new or improved independent source of supply which produces at least of one-third of its annual production of water during the period between mid-May and mid-September. A trial period ("Trial Period") for a new or improved independent source of supply shall commence on January 1st of the calendar year following the year in which that source was placed into production, and the Trial Period shall extend for three calendar years. At the conclusion of the Trial Period, the Allowance shall be increased by the number of ERUs served by the average annual production of the new or improved source during the Trial Period for that source, and Exhibit XIII shall be revised to reflect the new source or improved production capacity of an existing source.

 iii.  Decrease in Allowance . In the event that the annual water supply capacity of an Independent Source, or of all Independent Sources in aggregate, is found, under the provisions of Exhibit XIII, to be lower than the capacity listed in Exhibit XIII, the Allowance shall be reduced by the number of ERUs that could be served, on an annual basis, by a supply of the same size as the reduction in capacity of the Independent Source(s). In the event that this adjustment results in a negative Allowance, Water Utility shall pay Seattle an amount equal to the then-current ERU Fee multiplied by the (negative) Allowance multiplied by minus one. This amount shall be paid in annual installments over a period not to exceed five years. The Allowance shall be zero upon commencement of these payments.

 iv.  Monthly Payment of Facilities Charges . Water Utility shall pay FCs based on the number of ERUs added during the previous month determined by the number of meters installed. Until the Allowance is zero, the Allowance shall be reduced by one for each ERU added by Water Utility during the previous month, and such reduction of the Allowance shall be in lieu of payment of an FC for that ERU.

 v.  Seattle Report on ERUs . Seattle shall prepare and distribute a report no later than March 31st of each year showing the ERU count of the Seattle Retail Distribution System and each Wholesale Customer on such basis for the previous year and each year since the effective date of this contract.]

 e.  Rate Setting . The structure of FCs or water rates charged to the holders of Full and Partial Requirements Contracts shall be determined by Seattle, at its sole discretion, except that the price may not, without the consent of Water Utility, be set to collect more than the costs forecast under Section IV hereof and Rate of Return on Investment. FCs shall be calculated as set forth on page 1 of Exhibit VI.

 9.  Cost Audit . At the end of each fiscal year, Seattle shall provide a statement of actual costs allocated to each cost pool and other costs and revenues received, which statement may be audited by an external auditor selected by the Operating Board. In addition, Water Utility may have the statement audited by an external auditor of its choice, solely at Water Utility's expense.

 10.  Transition .

 a.  Settling the Purveyor Balance Account . The parties agree that they will settle the Purveyor Balance Account, as that term is used in Section III.I of the 1982 Water Purveyor Contract, in the following manner no later than December 31, 2011, unless the parties enter into a payment agreement in accordance with this subsection. The Purveyor Balance Account shall be credited if there is a surplus or charged if there is a deficit, to the Wholesale Customers who remained under the 1982 Water Purveyor Contract until the Effective Date of this contract. The Purveyor Balance Account as of December 31, 2010 (which will be finally audited in the 3rd quarter of 2011), shall be prorated by each of those Wholesale Customer's share of the total Purveyor demand (e.g flow) since the most recent year that the balance was at zero. There will be separate prorations for the Old Water and New Water accounts as those terms are defined in the 1982 Water Purveyor Contract. In the event the appropriate credits or charges are not or cannot be paid in full by December 31, 2011, the parties shall be entitled to pay the appropriate credits or charges over a term of up to three years with the then current interest at Seattle's Average Cost of Debt. The specific terms of any payment agreement between the parties shall be reasonable and subject to the review and approval of the parties.

 b.  Prior Operating Board Decisions . Water Utility acknowledges and agrees it will be bound by decisions the Operating Board has made under the authority in this contract that have been made prior to the Effective Date of this contract so that such decisions apply to all holders of Full and Partial Requirements Contracts.

 c.  Application of Facilities Charges based on Meter or Connection Size . Seattle and Water Utility acknowledge and agree that Water Utility has unresolved concerns relating to guidance issued by the Operating Board in 2002 regarding the application of FCs based on meter or connection size where other requirements (e.g. operational, regulatory) may dictate the meter or connection size, and therefore, may not be an appropriate indicator of the annual demand placed on water supplies. The parties agree that circumstances have changed since that guidance was issued that warrant reconsideration of the guidance. Therefore, Seattle will initiate a discussion with the Operating Board in 2011, which Water Utility may participate in to present its concerns, and will endeavor to resolve the issue for action by the Operating Board as soon as practicable after Water Utility becomes represented by the Operating Board.

 d.  Waiver of Facilities Charges . Seattle shall not charge Water Utility FCs until January 1, 2012 if the amount of water it purchases from Seattle does not exceed its old water allowance under the 1982 Water Purveyor Contract. This waiver, however, shall not relieve Water Utility from the record-keeping requirement of subsection IV.E.8 above.

 e.  Transition Growth Surcharge . A transition growth surcharge of $0.60 per CCF shall be applied to the rates of Water Utility for delivery of water in excess of the old water allowance of the 1982 Water Purveyor Contract through December 31, 2011. The revenue from this surcharge shall be used to discount the base rates of the holders of Full and Partial Requirements Contracts by not more than $0.16 per CCF. In the event that the revenues generated by the surcharge exceed those required to fund the discount, Seattle may keep the difference.

 f.  Early Contract Signing Fee . Within two months of the Effective Date of this contract, Water Utility agrees to pay to Seattle an Early Contract Signing Fee of $__________________. If a Wholesale Customer requires a longer period, they may pay the fee in monthly increments until December 2011 at 1% interest.

 g.  Transfer to Full and Partial Rates and Facilities Charges .

 i. Within two months of the Effective Date of this contract, Seattle will: 1) make appropriate changes to its billing system to charge Water Utility for water supplied under this contract at the then current rates for Full or Partial Requirements Contracts under Seattle Municipal Code ("SMC") Section 21.04.440.E.2 ("Billing System Change Date"); and 2) credit back to Water Utility the difference between the amount Water Utility paid for water supplied at the then current rates for Water Purveyor Contracts under SMC 21.04.440.E.1 and what the Water Utility would have paid for water supplied at the then current rates for Full or Partial Requirements Contracts under SMC 21.04.440.E.2 from January 1, 2011 until the Billing System Change Date.

 ii. Within two months of the Effective Date of this contract, Water Utility will submit to Seattle an accounting of the number of retail connections made to its water system between January 1, 2011 and the Effective Date of the contract and payment of any FCs at the then current FC rate under SMC 21.04.440.E.2 that would have been paid in accordance with this contract from January 1, 2011 until the Effective Date of this contract.

 h.  Existing Regional Deficit . The parties acknowledge and agree that as of December 31, 2010, there may be an existing regional deficit or surplus in the running balance under Section IV.I.1 that was created by Wholesale Customers signing contracts prior to 2011 and the Seattle Regional Distribution System. Although Water Utility did not contribute to the existing deficit or surplus, it will have to pay higher or lower rates in the 2012-2014 rate period to help eliminate the deficit or surplus, respectively. In the event of a deficit, Seattle agrees to credit back to Water Utility, 70% of the amount that Water Utility will contribute to eliminating the existing deficit through higher rates. In the event of a surplus, Water Utility agrees to pay Seattle 70% of the amount that Water Utility will benefit from eliminating the existing surplus through lower rates. The actual amount of the existing deficit or surplus will be determined during the annual cost audit process for 2010, which is targeted for third quarter 2011. The amount to be credited or charged will be based on Water Utility's percentage of 2010 annual flow times the total existing regional deficit or surplus times 70%. Upon the completion of the 2010 annual cost audit process, Seattle will provide Water Utility with an accounting of the total credit or charge in writing. Beginning January 2012, Seattle will provide one or more monthly credits or charges on Water Utility's water bill until the entire credit or charge balance is paid off. Seattle or Water utility, as appropriate, will pay the entire balance by December 31, 2012. Any outstanding credit or charge balance will accrue interest at Seattle's average cost of debt from December 31, 2010 until the entire balance is paid off.

 IV.F. Elective Services

 1.  Water Supply Services . Seattle may provide certain elective services (e.g. conservation, engineering) to Water Utility upon request by Water Utility. Such services shall be negotiated and contracted for separately between Water Utility and Seattle.

 2.  Transmission Wheeling . In consultation with the Operating Board, excess transmission capacity may be made available by Seattle for a fee for purposes of wheeling water between points within the Seattle Regional Water Supply System to Water Utility or to others.

 3.  Water Quality . So long as Seattle owns and operates a water quality lab, Water Utility may request the services of that lab based on its published rates.

 IV.G. Rate Adjustment

 1.  Rate Adjustment . Upon 120-days notice to Water Utility of its intent to do so, Seattle may adjust water service rates and FCs to Water Utility subject to the terms of this contract. Rate adjustments will be effected only within five years of the completion of a cost of service study to be conducted by Seattle, which shall include an analysis of the allocation of operation, maintenance and capital costs between cost pools. Such study shall be prepared in accordance with accepted industry standards. In addition, Seattle shall review the Operating Board's comments and recommendations on the rate proposal and provide a written explanation of any recommendations that are not accepted.

 2.  Rate Consultant . An independent rate consultant shall be selected by Seattle in consultation with the Operating Board. Detailed information and progress reports from the consultant will be made to Water Utility during the course of the study upon drafting of each major study section directly affecting Water Utility and other Wholesale Customers. A final consultant report shall be made available to Water Utility not less than 30 days before Seattle formally transmits any resulting rate adjustment proposal to the Operating Board.

 IV.H. Retail Rate-Setting

 Each party to this contract shall have sole authority for establishing retail rates, connection charges and other fees and charges within its respective jurisdiction.

 IV.I. Truing Actual Costs and Actual Revenues

 A mechanism for reconciling revenue targets for the various cost pools and the actual revenues received during each year shall be implemented by Seattle as follows:

 1. For each previously identified class of customers in each cost pool, Seattle shall maintain a running balance of the excess or deficit of actual rate revenues collected less actual expenses incurred. Each balance shall earn simple interest at the rate of Seattle's Average Cost of Debt. At the end of each year, each balance shall be adjusted to reflect the operating results of that year. The statement of these balances shall be reviewed and approved by an external auditor.

 2. FC balances shall be carried forward as set forth in Section IV.E.6.

 3. Each wholesale rate study shall adjust rates to eliminate the cost pool balances. ERU fees shall be based on the costs of increments in supply and transmission capacity, and shall not be adjusted to reflect surpluses or deficits in FC revenues.

 SECTION V. OPERATING BOARD

 1.  Purpose . The purpose of the Operating Board is to provide certain limited authority to a board of representatives over policy and operational matters as they affect the Seattle Regional Water Supply System.

 2.  Structure and Authority . The Operating Board shall have the powers and authority as set forth herein. Exhibit IV describes the structure and authority of the Operating Board. In the event of a conflict between provisions of this contract which grant specific powers to the Operating Board and Exhibit IV, such grants of specific powers shall control.

 3.  Review . The structure and authority of the Operating Board may be reviewed as of January 1, 2012 and every five years thereafter to determine its effectiveness in addressing regional and contractual issues. The review may address the composition of the Board and its powers and authority as set forth herein and in Exhibit IV, provided that notwithstanding any other term or provision of this contract, Seattle shall not have the power to disband the Operating Board nor take away or diminish the powers vested in the Operating Board as set forth in Sections II, III and IV of this contract. Either party may initiate the review. The reviewing party shall provide the other with its comments and proposals. The parties agree to consider the other party's comments and proposals and to respond in writing stating its reasons for rejecting any proposals and the reasons for its own counter-proposal.

 EXHIBIT III

 DEMAND CHARGE METHODOLOGY

 The policy of Seattle Public Utilities is to supply water to its Wholesale Customers at, as near as is practical, the twenty-four hour average flow rate, during the peak demand season (June through August). To comply, the Wholesale Customers have to construct adequate storage volume within their individual systems, or sometimes collectively, so as to avoid excessive peak flow withdrawals from the Seattle Transmission Facilities. The Demand Metering Program is established to set performance standards, and to monitor the Wholesale Customer's compliance with this policy. If an individual Water Utility exceeds the prescribed threshold, a "demand charge" is calculated.

 Except where other agreements supersede the provisions of this contract, each Water Utility shall be subject to a demand charge based on effective deficient storage, as determined by the peak instantaneous flow rate, and the equivalent financing costs to provide storage. The demand charge rate (i.e., dollars per 1000 gallons of deficient storage) shall be based on the equivalent cost of providing the deficient storage. This rate will be determined as part of each rate study.

 The Demand Metering Program is charged with implementation of the "demand charge" methodology. It shall be the responsibility of Seattle, in consultation with the Operating Board, to determine the appropriate means to achieve the program's purpose. The options that may be considered range from temporary suspension on a year by year basis to full activation, as described below.

 There shall be no requirement for Seattle to install demand- metering equipment at each Service Connection in order to assess a demand charge. Seattle may choose to apply "demand metering" selectively to certain parts of the Seattle Transmission Facilities that are designated as "critical" from the standpoint of hydraulic capacity or other operational considerations. Seattle may choose to apply "demand metering" intermittently in various parts of the Seattle Transmission Facilities for the purpose of monitoring for compliance by individual Wholesale Customers or groups of Wholesale Customers on a given line segment.

 EXHIBIT IV

 OPERATING BOARD STRUCTURE

 1.  Structure . The Operating Board (or "Board") shall be structured as follows:

 a. The Board shall consist of seven (7) members, composed of three members representing Seattle Public Utilities (SPU), three members representing Seattle's Wholesale Customers selected as described below and one independent party selected as set forth below to be a tie-breaker as needed. Board members shall, to the best of their ability, act in the best interests of the Seattle Regional Water Supply System as a whole and shall not represent the interest of a group of utilities or an individual utility.

 b. The term of each Board position shall commence on January 1 and shall be for four (4) years. Terms of each Board position shall be staggered such that no more than two positions are renewed in any single year. Board members may serve not more than three successive terms.

 c. Three Board members representing the Wholesale Customers will be selected from the holders of Full and Partial Requirements Contracts . Wholesale Customers will be sorted into three categories based on utility size. The selected categories will be small, medium and large utilities, which will be made up from approximately equal numbers of holders of Full and Partial Requirements Contracts. Each category of utility may elect, by majority vote (one vote per utility) its representative to the Operating Board. The Board will be recomposed on January 1, 2012 and every 5 years thereafter.

 d. The seventh member of the Board shall be a person having expertise in the operations of regional water supply systems. Such person shall be selected by majority vote of the other Board members. In the event of a deadlock in selecting the independent representative, the independent Board member shall be selected by Judicial Arbitration and Mediation Services Inc., of Seattle, Washington or its successor. The seventh member shall not vote on issues coming before the Board unless there is a deadlock in the voting among the other six Board members. The seventh member may nevertheless express his or her opinions in Operating Board discussions. Such member shall have no employment, financial or contractual relationship with Seattle nor any Wholesale Customer or any other actual or apparent conflict of interest in holding this position.

 2.  Voting . Except as otherwise provided above, each member of the Board shall have one vote on all matters coming before the Board. Each Board member may appoint an alternate to vote in his or her absence. A quorum of four (4) Board members present shall be required for any vote. Members of the Board may not grant proxies for any vote.

 3.  Chairperson . the Board shall have a Chairperson who will be selected and have duties as defined below:

 b. the Chairperson shall be selected at the first regularly scheduled meeting of each new year.

 c. All Chairpersons shall be selected by the Board using a nomination and voting process.

 d. Nomination for the position of Chairperson shall be taken from Board members. The Chairperson shall be selected based upon the simple majority vote of Board members. Should the Board fail to elect a Chairperson at the first regularly scheduled meeting of the new year, a designated representative from SPU shall be the Acting Chairperson until such time as the Board elects a Chairperson.

 e. The Chairperson shall have the responsibility to call meetings, determine the agenda and preside over meetings. In the absence of the Chairperson, for whatever reason, a designated representative from SPU shall be the Acting Chairperson for that meeting. The Chairperson shall also act as the spokesperson for the Board and liaison between the Administrator and the Seattle City Council's Committee on Seattle Public Utilities & Neighborhoods or successor committees.

 4.  Schedule/Procedures . The Board shall adopt a regular meeting schedule and notify all Wholesale Customers of the schedule. The Operating Board may adopt it own internal procedures. The latest edition of Roberts Rules of Order shall, in the absence of agreement by the Operating Board on procedural matters, govern all meetings and votes of the Operating Board.

 5.  Reporting . The Board will provide reports to the Wholesale Customers and to the Seattle City Council Committee on Seattle Public Utilities & Neighborhoods, or successor City Council committee, on its decisions and recommendations in a timely manner.

 6.  Responsibilities and Authority of the Board . Where no clear responsibility or authority on an issue is established in this contract the responsibility and authority shall rest with the Seattle City Council.

 7.  Expenses . The Board shall be authorized to incur reasonable expenses which will be allocated by the Board to either or both of the New Transmission or Supply Cost Pools.

 EXHIBIT V - RESERVED

 EXHIBIT VI

 Calculation of ERU's as a Part of Facilities Charges

 The ERU Fee is:

 * the flat debt service payment required to finance the facility providing the ERU over the lesser of (i) s.

 3.  Water Utility's Option to be Conservation Service Provider . Water Utility may elect to provide its own water conservation program, beyond its commitment to the Regional Water Conservation Program to meet conservation targets adopted by the Operating Board, or more stringent targets. Water Utility shall bear the additional costs thereof and shall be solely responsible for its implementation. Under this option, Water Utility shall be evaluated for meeting the additional water conservation targets solely by its own performance.

 4.  Incentives and Penalties . The Operating Board may adopt penalties for shortfalls in water conservation and rewards for meeting or exceeding adopted targets. In the event Water Utility or Seattle fails to meet the adopted targets set by the Operating Board, the Operating Board may assess a penalty. Penalties may not exceed the cost of Seattle undertaking those conservation measures reasonably needed to achieve the adopted target.

 5.  Postponing the Need for New Water Supply Facilities . In order to avoid the necessity of developing new physical water supply facilities for as long as reasonably practicable, any water saved through conservation in either Seattle's or Water Utility's retail service areas shall be dedicated first to the municipal and industrial water supply requirements of the Seattle Regional Water Supply System before any other use of such water may be undertaken.

 SECTION III. CONDITIONS OF SERVICE

 III.A. Minimum Hydraulic Gradient

 1.  Initial Minimum . Seattle shall maintain a minimum hydraulic gradient or head at a maximum flow rate in amounts and at locations described in Exhibit II attached hereto for each Service Connection from the Seattle Regional Water Supply System to Water Utility's distribution system. Such gradients and locations shall be contained in Seattle's and Water Utility's future water system plans. Seattle shall operate and maintain the Seattle Transmission Facilities necessary to carry out such obligation. If Seattle and the Operating Board find that a project resulting in the modification of such minimum gradient or head would benefit the Seattle Regional Water Supply System as a whole, the minimum hydraulic gradient or head described in Exhibit II may be modified by Seattle if such modification is feasible from an economic, land use and engineering perspective taking into account the facilities required to carry out and for Water Utility to adapt to such modification. Seattle may make these modifications only once during any fifteen (15) year period provided that four (4) years advance written notice is given to Water Utility, unless a shorter notice is approved by the Operating Board.

 2.  Emergencies . If Seattle is prevented by emergency circumstances from providing such minimum hydraulic gradient, Seattle shall supply not less than the volume of water equivalent to the maximum 24-hour average flow rate required by Water Utility as shown on Exhibit II for each 24 hour period that the minimum hydraulic gradient is interrupted.

 3.  Additional Service Connections . Additional Service Connections between Water Utility's and Seattle Regional Water Supply System's water systems or adjusted minimum gradients may be established from time to time by mutual agreement between Seattle and Water Utility subject to approval by the Operating Board. Exhibit II shall be appropriately revised to reflect such additions or adjustments.

 III.B. Resale to Other Parties

 Water Utility may sell water supplied by Seattle to other water utilities located outside of Water Utility's existing or future service area only upon the prior written consent of Seattle (or oral, in case of emergency). Agreements for resale of water by Water Utility listed in Exhibit I are hereby approved by Seattle subject to whatever written terms, conditions and limitations that Seattle has imposed on such resale.

 III.C. Interconnection With Other Systems

 1.  Prohibition on Interconnection . Water Utility shall not interconnect any part of its system supplied with water from Seattle with other water systems without the prior written approval of the Operating Board, or, in case of emergency, upon oral approval by Seattle, which shall not be unreasonably withheld. Any such interconnection shall be subject to the approval of the Washington State Department of Health and the installation of a meter. Such other systems must be in compliance with all applicable local, State and federal laws and regulations including the requirement that they have a valid operating permit issued by the Washington State Department of Health.

 2.  Requests by Seattle to Interconnect . Seattle may request that Water Utility interconnect its water system to the water system of an adjacent Wholesale Customer. Water Utility shall comply with that request subject to the terms and conditions set forth below.

 a.  Requirement for Interconnection . If Water Utility does not consent to Seattle's request for interconnection, Seattle may propose the interconnection of Water Utility's water system to the adjacent Wholesale Customer to the Operating Board. Water Utility may present facts and arguments to the Operating Board in opposition to the interconnection and document its costs in making the interconnection and conveying water to the adjacent Wholesale Customer. The Operating Board shall hear and consider the matter. Upon (a) a written finding by the Operating Board that the proposed interconnection with an adjacent Wholesale Customer is feasible taking into account Water Utility's capabilities, limitations, and obligations, (b) a written finding by the Operating Board that such interconnection benefits the Seattle Regional Water Supply System and (c) a written demand of the Operating Board that Water Utility carry out the interconnection, Water Utility shall be required to interconnect its facilities to the adjacent Wholesale Customer for the purpose of supplying water to that Wholesale Customer through the distribution system of Water Utility, provided that the adjacent Wholesale Customer agrees to perform the interconnection in a location and according to a schedule which does not unduly disrupt Water Utility's operations, and to be responsible for the payment and indemnity obligations in Section III.C.2.b below.

 b.  Payment and Indemnity . Water Utility shall be paid its actual costs of providing such interconnection and water transmission service by the adjacent Wholesale Customer receiving the water, plus a reasonable amount for overhead, administration and rate of return (equal to Rate of Return on Investment) on such costs, and Water Utility shall be indemnified from any liability that may result from providing such interconnection by the adjacent Wholesale Customer. The Operating Board shall adopt a standard methodology for calculating costs that ensures that Water Utility is fairly compensated for such service.

 III.D. Development of Regional Supply and Transmission Infrastructure

 Final decisions and authority to approve construction of capital infrastructure related to the Seattle Regional Water Supply System shall rest with the Seattle City Council. Capital construction activities include, but are not limited to installations, renewals, replacements, upgrades, expansions, and any other costs included in Seattle's comprehensive capital facilities plan.

 III.E. Metering Equipment

 Seattle shall own and perform testing, cleaning and recalibration on appropriate metering devices and associated appurtenances to measure the amount of water delivered to Water Utility at the Service Connection pursuant to this contract. Seattle shall perform all other work at Water Utility's expense regardless of the cause provided that the cause is consistent with AWWA and safety standards and practices. Water Utility shall operate and maintain its water system in a manner that the water flowing through the Service Connection meter operates within the normal operating range for the meter as specified by the manufacturer.

 Until such time as Seattle determines it to be economical to install metering devices to measure the amount of water delivered from the Seattle Regional Water Supply System to the Seattle Retail Distribution System, the amount of water delivered to the Seattle Retail Distribution System shall be measured indirectly by subtracting the metered water delivered to all of Seattle's wholesale customers from 98% of the total amount of water exiting Seattle's sources of supply as measured by the supply meters.

 SECTION IV. COST OF WATER SUPPLY & TRANSMISSION

 Cost-based rates are a water industry accepted practice and the historical practice of Seattle and the Wholesale Customers. The rate-making principles, policies and methodologies set forth in this Section IV are intended to meet the objective of equitable and cost-based rates.

 IV.A. Rate-making and Cost-allocation Principles

 The parties will apply the following general principles and policies to the establishment of all rates, charges, and cost allocations for water supply, transmission, and related services under this contract.

 1. No expenses attributable to electric power development may be allocated to the cost pools identified herein unless the pools are allocated a commensurate share of revenue derived from such development.

 2. Seattle shall utilize generally accepted accounting principles, as may be amended from time to time, consistently applied as a basis for developing the financial information upon which rates and charges are based.

 3. Abrupt changes in financial policies should be avoided.

 4. The rate structure should encourage the efficient use of water, conservation and the timely development of new environmentally responsible water sources and should incorporate seasonal rates and other pricing approaches to encourage efficient use.

 5. The rate structure should be innovative, flexible and adaptive whenever it is cost effective and beneficial in furthering the rate-making policies.

 6. The rate structure should be simple to administer and easily understandable.

 7. The rate structure should be fair and equitable while balancing the needs of all parties.

 8. Capital costs which benefit only a new Wholesale Customer shall be allocated to that customer and not to any cost pool described in this contract.

 9. Capital costs associated with improvements or facilities which benefit or serve individual Wholesale Customers or the Seattle Retail Distribution System may be allocated to a sub-regional or regional cost pool to the extent necessary to alleviate a disproportionate adverse impact to that Wholesale Customer or the Seattle Retail Distribution System from a regional or sub- regional capital improvement and where (i) such impact could have been reasonably avoided through a different project design, or (ii) the other Wholesale Customers, including the Seattle Retail Distribution System, receive tangible benefits, directly or indirectly, from the adopted capital facilities plan.

 10. The Seattle Retail Distribution System shall be treated as the equivalent of a Wholesale Customer of the Seattle Regional Water Supply System for the purpose of charging Seattle the same wholesale rates and charges as Water Utility for water supply and transmission. Costs calculated under the costs pools described below shall apply to all Wholesale Customers and to the Seattle Retail Distribution System.

 11. The allocation of costs associated with capital construction activities within the Seattle Regional Water Supply System shall be the responsibility of the Operating Board. The Operating Board shall use its best efforts to determine and approve a cost allocation method for infrastructure projects prior to the capital project obtaining construction approval from the Seattle City Council. Failure of the Operating Board to determine and approve a cost allocation method shall not hinder the Seattle City Council from approving capital infrastructure projects in order to assure Seattle's ability to fulfill the requirements of this contract.

 12. All parties will use best efforts in establishing rates and cost allocations that reflect the rate-making and cost allocation principles set forth in this Section IV.A.

 IV.B. Ratemaking Framework

 Subject to the foregoing principles, wholesale rates and charges for the services described in this contract shall be developed by Seattle based on the following framework:

 1.  Water Supply and Transmission Service . The costs of water supply and transmission of water shall be accounted for separately in the water supply and transmission cost pools described below. The price for each service shall be recovered through separate rates for each service. All direct costs incurred in providing water supply and transmission services shall be allocated to the appropriate cost pool and recovered through the rates for each service. In addition, certain indirect costs consisting of a reasonable overhead and administration cost shall be allocated to the appropriate cost pool and recovered through rates for each service.

 2.  Water Supply - Basic and Elective Services . The costs of supplying water falls into two categories -- basic and elective services. Basic service costs include direct and indirect costs attributable to the delivery of water to the Wholesale Customers and to Seattle's Retail Distribution System pursuant to the foregoing principles. Elective services are optional services, such as water quality laboratory services and specific engineering support that Seattle makes available.

 3.  Conservation . Costs incurred by Seattle for the Regional Water Conservation Program shall be allocated to the New Supply Cost Pool and the Operating Board will determine to recover those costs either through rates or Facility Charges "FCs" from Wholesale Customers and Seattle.

 IV.C. Water Supply Pricing -- Basic Services

 1.  Two Water Supply Cost Pools . For the purposes of determining costs of water supply, there shall be two cost pools: An existing supply cost pool ("Existing Supply Cost Pool") and a new supply cost pool (" New Supply Cost Pool").

 a.  Existing Supply Cost Pool . The Existing Supply Cost Pool shall be accounted for as follows:

 i. A basic services rate for water supply shall be charged to recover the full costs of operating, maintaining, repairing, renewing and replacing the Existing Supply Resources incurred by Seattle.

 ii. All regional conservation programs undertaken by Seattle prior to January 1, 2002, shall be considered an Existing Supply Resource cost.

 iii. Renewal and replacement of Existing Supply Resources will be an Existing Supply Resource cost.

 b.  New Supply Cost Pool . The New Supply Cost Pool shall be accounted for as follows:

 i. Water supply resources developed after January 1, 2002 that expand the capacity of the Seattle Regional Water Supply System ("New Supply Resources"), including the costs of the Regional Water Conservation Program from January 1, 2002, shall be included in the New Supply Cost Pool. If any portion of a New Supply Resource project enhances reliability of Existing Supply Resources, the costs thereof may be allocated to the Existing Supply Cost Pool if the Operating Board and Seattle both agree.

 ii. The cost of New Supply Resources plus Rate of Return on Investment may be recovered either through FCs or new supply rates charged to the holders of Full and Partial Requirements Contracts and the Seattle Retail Distribution System. The new supply rate shall be applied to all holders of Full and Partial Requirements Contracts and the Seattle Retail Distribution System.

 iii. The Operating Board shall determine the portion of the New Supply Resource costs that shall be recovered through FCs or through new supply rates. The FCs and new supply rates may be scalable to create an incentive for developers to build housing or commercial units with efficient water usage levels. Water Utility, as well as each other Wholesale Customer and Seattle in setting rates for retail customers shall be free to choose the method of incorporating FCs or new supply rates into their own retail rates and charges.

 iv. Holders of Full and Partial Requirements Contracts who have not purchased water from Seattle under the 1982 Water Purveyor Contract shall be assessed the full marginal costs of the operation, including Rate of Return on Investment, of the New Supply Resources. This assessment may be satisfied by either paying FCs and new supply rates or arranging a special water supply rate in lieu of paying FCs.

 c.  Emergency Surcharge . In the event of a drought, catastrophe, or other extraordinary condition that requires emergency expenditures to maintain a sufficient water supply, Seattle may impose an emergency surcharge on all holders of Full and Partial Requirements Contracts in order to pay for such expenditures or maintain financial stability of the Seattle Regional Water Supply System, or both. Any such emergency surcharge shall be presented to the Operating Board prior to adoption by the Seattle City Council. Seattle shall consider the comments of the Operating Board but shall nevertheless have the full authority to adopt the emergency surcharge.

 IV.D. Transmission Pricing - Basic Services

 1.  Transmission Costs Pools . For purposes of determining the cost of the transmission of water to the Wholesale Customers there shall be two [three if subregional pool applies] transmission cost pools consisting of an existing transmission cost pool ("Existing Transmission Cost Pool") and a new transmission cost pool ("New Transmission Cost Pool").

 a.  Existing Transmission Cost Pool . Costs to be allocated to the Existing Transmission Cost Pool shall consist of the following: operation, maintenance, repairs, renewals, and replacements to the Seattle Transmission Facilities.

 i. The Seattle Transmission Facilities are owned and operated as a regional network by Seattle to convey water to wholesale customers and to the Seattle Retail Distribution System. Therefore, the price of transmission for water transmitted within the Seattle Transmission Facilities shall be calculated on the same basis to holders of Full and Partial Requirements Contracts and the Seattle Retail Distribution System.

 ii. Costs incurred for purposes of transmission reliability may be included in the Existing Transmission Cost Pool subject to the approval of the Operating Board and Seattle.

 b.  New Transmission Cost Pool . The cost of new transmission facilities shall be included in the New Transmission Cost Pool. The renewal, replacement, upgrade, expansion, or modification of existing Seattle Transmission Facilities which create an expansion of transmission capacity may be allocated to the New Transmission Cost Pool. The Operating Board shall decide what portion of costs of renewal, replacement, upgrade, expansion or modification of existing Seattle Transmission Facilities may be allocated to the New Transmission Cost Pool and what portion of costs of a transmission project that extends the geographic extent of the transmission system that shall be allocated to the New Transmission Cost Pool or recovered from a new Wholesale Customer if the project benefits only that new Wholesale Customer. Except for costs allocated to a specific Wholesale Customer, New Transmission Cost Pool costs shall be recovered through new transmission rates or FCs as determined by the Operating Board. The new transmission rate shall be applied in a uniform manner to all holders of Full and Partial Requirements Contracts and the Seattle Retail Distribution System.

 c.  [_____________ Sub-regional Cost Pool . Water Utility is served, in part, by the sub- regional water transmission facilities listed in Exhibit XI. The costs of operating, maintaining, repairing and replacing these facilities shall be included in the __________ Sub-regional Cost Pool, together with any other costs Water Utility and Seattle agree to include.]

 2.  Demand Charge

 a. Seattle may adopt a demand charge in accordance with the methodology described in Exhibit III. The demand charge rate (i.e., dollars per 1000 gallons of deficient storage) shall be based on the equivalent cost of providing the deficient storage.

 b. The proceeds of the demand charge will be treated in rate setting as a credit to the New Transmission Cost Pool.

 c. Seattle shall suspend the demand charge rate in the event of emergencies and unforeseen conditions.

 3.  Cost of New or Changed Service Connection . If Seattle requests a change in the location of the Service Connection to Water Utility for the benefit of the Seattle Regional Water Supply System, then the costs, including any retirement costs of the old Service Connection, shall be included in the appropriate transmission cost pool. If Water Utility requests a new Service Connection or a change in location of an existing Service Connection, then Water Utility shall pay the costs of the new or changed Service Connection, including any retirement costs of the old Service Connection regardless of the cause provided that the cause is consistent with AWWA and safety standards and practices.

 IV.E. Allocation of Costs and Revenues into Cost Pools

 1.  Accounting . Seattle shall maintain a cost accounting system consistent with the provisions of this contract and generally accepted accounting principles, as amended from time to time, consistently applied in developing the financial information for determining the costs of acquisition, construction, repair, renewal, replacement, upgrade, expansion, maintenance, and operation of the facilities in each cost pool.

 a.  Asset Accounts . An asset account shall be maintained for each facility and within that account Seattle shall record the original cost of that facility plus betterments and less retirements.

 b.  Depreciation . Facilities shall be depreciated according to industry-standard water system asset lives and a record of life-to-date depreciation shall be maintained for each facility. No depreciation shall be recorded in the first calendar year of operation of a facility. A full year's depreciation shall be recorded in every subsequent year.

 c.  Net Book Value . The net book value of any facility shall be its original cost plus betterments and less retirements as recorded in its facility asset account, less life-to-date depreciation.

 2.  Infrastructure Costs . Each cost pool shall include the infrastructure costs for its respective facilities, calculated on a utility, cash or other basis depending upon the facility and the cost pool as set forth below.

 a.  Utility Basis . The utility basis shall be used to calculate the infrastructure costs for all Existing Supply Resources and Seattle Transmission Facilities, as well as their replacements and betterments. The utility basis may also be used for New Supply Resources and new transmission facilities in Seattle's discretion. Under the utility basis, the infrastructure cost for a facility in any year shall be the sum of (i) the annual depreciation expense recorded for that facility and (ii) the product of the net book value of that facility and the Rate of Return on Investment.

 At Seattle's discretion, interest costs may be considered current infrastructure costs during the construction of a facility. However, any such interest costs must be considered contributions in aid of construction, and not included in the Net Book Value of the facility for purposes of calculating Utility Basis costs in future years.

 b.  Cash Basis . The cash basis may be used in Seattle's discretion for New Supply Resources and transmission facilities or a portion thereof. Under the cash basis, the infrastructure cost for a facility in any year shall be the actual cash expenditure made by Seattle in that year for either the payment of construction costs or actual principal and interest costs on debt issued to finance its construction. In the event that the depreciation lifetime of the facility is less than the term of the debt issued to finance all or a portion of the facility, debt maturities will be selected such that the construction cost of the facility will be fully amortized at the end of its depreciation lifetime.

 c.  Other Basis . Seattle, with the approval of the Operating Board, may determine one or more other bases on which to calculate infrastructure costs and may apply these bases to facilities in the New Supply and New Transmission Cost Pools. Disposition of any facilities under another basis will be determined at the same time in accordance with Section IV.E.4.

 3.  Operations Costs . The costs of operating the assets assigned to a cost pool shall be included in the cost pool. The annual operations costs of a cost pool shall be the labor, materials, equipment and other direct costs required for the operation, maintenance, and repair of the facilities in that cost pool, together with any net profit or expense from the disposition of facilities in that pool. Operations costs shall include the cost of general and administrative overhead applied in a manner consistent with its application to capital construction projects.

 a.  Existing Supply Operations Costs . The parties agree that an efficient way of handling operations costs for the Existing Supply Cost Pool shall be as follows: The operations cost base in the Existing Supply Cost Pool for the year 2010 shall be determined in accordance with the line item labeled "2010 Costs in identified activities" under Existing Supply in Note 2 -- Operations Costs, Notes to the Wholesale Statements for the City of Seattle, Seattle Public Utilities, Water Fund, during the annual cost-audit process for 2010 in accordance with Section IV.E.10, which occurs by the end of 2011 and applies to all Wholesale Customers and Seattle. Seattle will notify Water Utility of the actual 2010 operations cost base in the Existing Supply Cost Pool in writing, which shall become incorporated as part of this contract at that time. In each succeeding year, the amount of the operations cost base from the previous year shall be adjusted by the percentage increase in the operations cost in the Existing Supply cost centers identified in Exhibit IX, as amended from time to time.

 b.  Existing Transmission Operations Costs . The parties agree that an efficient way of handling operations costs for the Existing Transmission Cost Pool shall be as follows: the operations costs base in the Existing Transmission Cost Pool for the year 2010 shall be determined in accordance with the line item labeled "2010 Costs in identified activities" under Existing Transmission in Note 2 -- Operations Costs, Notes to the Wholesale Statements for the City of Seattle, Seattle Public Utilities, Water Fund, during the annual cost-audit process for 2010 in accordance with Section IV.E.10, which occurs by the end of 2011 and applies to all Wholesale Customers and Seattle. Seattle will notify Water Utility of the actual 2010 operations cost base in the Existing Transmission Cost Pool in writing, which shall become incorporated as part of this contract at that time. In each succeeding year, the amount of the operations cost base from the previous year shall be adjusted by the percentage increase in the operations cost in the Existing Transmission cost centers identified in Exhibit IX, as amended from time to time.

 c.  New Supply Operations Costs . The operation costs of the Regional Water Conservation Program after January 1, 2002, together with the costs of operating facilities assigned to the New Supply Cost Pool and any other costs allocated by the Operating Board, shall be assigned to the New Supply Cost Pool. The operations cost base in the New Supply Cost Pool for 2010 shall be determined in accordance with the line item labeled "2010 Costs in identified activities" under New Supply in Note 2 -- Operations Costs, Notes to the Wholesale Statements for the City of Seattle, Seattle Public Utilities, Water Fund, during the annual cost-audit process for 2010 in accordance with Section IV.E.10, which occurs by the end of 2011 and applies to all Wholesale Customers and Seattle. Seattle will notify Water Utility of the actual 2010 operations cost base in the New Supply Cost Pool in writing, which shall become incorporated as part of this contract at that time. In each succeeding year, the amount of the operations cost base shall be adjusted by the percentage increase in the operations costs in the New Supply cost centers as identified in Exhibit IX, as amended from time to time.

 d.  New Transmission Operations Costs . The actual costs of operating facilities assigned to the New Transmission Cost Pool and any other costs allocated by the Operating Board, shall be assigned to the New Transmission Cost Pool.

 e.  [___________ Sub-regional Operations Costs . The actual costs of operating facilities assigned to the xxxxx Sub-regional Cost Pool, together with any additional operations costs approved by Water Utility and Seattle.]

 4.  Disposition Costs . The costs of disposing of assets within a cost pool shall be included in the cost pool. Net disposition costs shall be calculated as follows:

 a.  Disposition Under the Utility Basis . The net book value of the facility, less any sales, salvage, or other revenues derived from the disposition of that facility.

 b.  Disposition Under the Cash Basis . The value of principal of unpaid maturities of debt used to finance the construction cost of the facility, less any sales, salvage or other revenues derived from the disposition of that facility.

 c.  Disposition Under Other Basis . Disposition of any facilities whose infrastructure costs are calculated on another basis under section IV.E.2.c. above shall be determined by the parties as part of the definition of such other basis.

 5.  Creation of Additional Cost Pools . Seattle, in its discretion, may create additional cost pools to provide equity and flexibility in payment arrangements and the allocation of costs as the Seattle Regional Water Supply System expands to include new infrastructure, operations, and customers. The costs in an additional cost pool, or a portion thereof, may be added to an existing cost pool subject to the consent of the Operating Board if the costs to be allocated satisfy the criteria for allocation to the existing cost pool.

 6.  Facilities Charge Revenues . Supply FC revenues, which consist of those revenues from FCs the Operating Board has determined are to recover a certain portion of New Supply Resources costs, shall offset infrastructure costs in the New Supply Cost Pool. Surpluses and deficits in actual Supply FC revenues over costs to be recovered through the Supply FC shall be carried forward and earn simple interest at Seattle's Average Cost of Debt.

 Any current-year deficit (including any surplus balance available from previous years) shall be paid by rates for the New Supply Cost Pool. New Supply Cost Pool rates shall be discounted by surplus Supply FC revenues until any deficit Supply FC balance is repaid, except the amount of this discount shall not exceed, without the agreement of the Operating Board, twice the maximum annual deficit paid by the rate for the New Supply Cost Pool in any one year.

 In the event that Supply FC surplus balances exceed the Net Book Value of assets whose costs are allocated to the Supply FC, the difference between the Supply FC balance and the Net Book Value of these assets shall be used to discount the rate for the New Supply Cost Pool (and the Supply FC surplus balance shall be reduced by the amount of this discount). The use and accounting for transmission FCs shall be done in a like manner to supply FCs. Seattle and Water Utility agree that FC revenues are the sole property of Seattle.

 7.  Allocation of Cost Pools by Customer Class . The costs in cost pools shall be allocated within the pools as follows:

 a.  Allocation of Existing Supply Cost Pool . The total cost of the Existing Supply Cost Pool shall be allocated to two customer classes as follows:

 i.  Block Purchase Customer Class . The portion of costs in the Existing Supply Cost Pool allocated to holders of Block Purchase Contracts shall be determined pursuant to those contracts.

 ii.  Full and Partial Requirements Customer Class . The holders of Full and Partial Requirements Contracts and the Seattle Retail Distribution System shall be allocated the remaining costs in the Existing Supply Cost Pool.

 b.  Allocation of New Supply Cost Pool . The costs allocated to the New Supply Cost Pool shall be:

 i.  Block Purchase Customer Class . The holders of Block Purchase Contracts shall be allocated no costs from the New Supply Cost Pool.

 ii  Full and Partial Requirements Customer Class . The holders of Full and Partial Requirements Contracts and the Seattle Retail Distribution System shall be allocated all costs in the New Supply Cost Pool.

 c.  Allocation of Existing Transmission Cost Pool . The costs of the Existing Transmission Cost Pool shall be allocated as follows:

 i.  Block Purchase Customer Class . The proportion of costs in the Existing Transmission Cost Pool allocated to holders of Block Purchase Contracts shall be determined pursuant to those contracts.

 ii  Full and Partial Requirements Customer Class . The holders of Full and Partial Requirements Contracts and the Seattle Retail Distribution System shall be allocated the remaining costs in the Existing Transmission Cost Pool.

 d.  Allocation of New Transmission Cost Pool .

 i.  Block Purchase Customer Class . The holders of Block Purchase Contracts shall be allocated no costs from the New Transmission Cost Pool.

 ii  Full and Partial Requirements Customer Class . The holders of Full and Partial Requirements Contracts and the Seattle Retail Distribution System shall be allocated all costs in the New Supply Cost Pool.

 e.  Allocation of Additional Cost Pools . At the time an additional cost pool is created by Seattle pursuant to Section IV.E.5, the additional cost pool will be allocated by customer class.

 If Applicable:

 f.  [Allocation of ________ Sub-region Cost Pool . All costs in the _______ Sub-regional Cost Pool shall be allocated according to Exhibit XII.]

 8.  Facilities Charges . If Seattle establishes FCs as authorized herein, then such charges shall be calculated as follows:

 a.  ERU Definition . Seattle shall develop a definition of an Equivalent Residential Unit ("ERU") based on, meter size as set forth in Exhibit VI, number of residential units, water use, or other basis which shall be consistent with accepted industry standards. The Operating Board shall have the right to review and comment on the definition and Seattle shall consider the Operating Board's comments.

 b.  Record-Keeping . Water Utility shall provide Seattle with an annual accounting, in a form acceptable to Seattle, of its retail water service connections by January 31st of each year, which shall be accurate as of December 31st of the preceding year. Water Utility shall report the size of the meter and other pertinent data such as the number of residential units or square footage served or water use. Seattle shall provide Wholesale Customers with an annual accounting of its retail service connections on the same basis. Upon reasonable notice, Water Utility shall make its billing and connection records available to Seattle for inspection and copying during normal business hours and Seattle's billing and connection records shall be made available to any Wholesale Customer on the same basis.

 c.  Annual Calculation of ERU's . Until such time as Seattle develops another basis, the calculation of ERU's in any year shall be the annual growth in the number of meters installed by Water Utility during the year taking into account the size of each meter.

 d.  Imposition of Facilities Charges . Seattle shall collect and Water Utility shall pay FCs based on the following:

 i. the number of ERU's added during the previous month determined by the number of meters installed. Seattle shall pay FCs into the accounts of the Seattle Regional Water Supply System on the same basis.

 ii. Seattle Report on ERUs. Seattle shall prepare and distribute a report no later than March 31st of each year showing the ERU count of the Seattle Retail Distribution System and each Wholesale Customer on such basis for the previous year and each year since the effective date of this contract.

 i. [ Growth Allowance for Independent Sources . Water Utility operates the sources of water supply independent of the Seattle Regional Water Supply System listed in Exhibits I and XII. These sources of independent supply are sufficient to serve an additional ____ ERUs within Water Utility's service area, and Water Utility shall have a growth allowance (the "Allowance") for these ____ ERUs as of the effective date of this contract. The Allowance shall be a credit against growth in ERUs within Water Utility's service area.

 ii.  Increase in Allowance for New Independent Sources or Improvement of Existing Sources . Water Utility may develop new sources of independent supply in addition to those listed in Exhibits I and XIII or make improvements in the existing sources of supply in Exhibits I and XIII to increase the yield of those sources, and shall provide Seattle with six months written notice before placing each such additional source or yield improvement into production. However, this provision shall in no way relieve Water Utility from the restrictions on reducing Water Utility's purchase commitment under Section II.B.5 of this contract. Water Utility shall maintain records of the monthly production of each independent source of supply in a manner consistent with industry standards, and shall allow Seattle, upon reasonable notice, to examine and copy these records at their customary location during normal business hours. The Allowance shall be adjusted as follows for each new or improved independent source of supply which produces at least of one-third of its annual production of water during the period between mid-May and mid-September. A trial period ("Trial Period") for a new or improved independent source of supply shall commence on January 1st of the calendar year following the year in which that source was placed into production, and the Trial Period shall extend for three calendar years. At the conclusion of the Trial Period, the Allowance shall be increased by the number of ERUs served by the average annual production of the new or improved source during the Trial Period for that source, and Exhibit XIII shall be revised to reflect the new source or improved production capacity of an existing source.

 iii.  Decrease in Allowance . In the event that the annual water supply capacity of an Independent Source, or of all Independent Sources in aggregate, is found, under the provisions of Exhibit XIII, to be lower than the capacity listed in Exhibit XIII, the Allowance shall be reduced by the number of ERUs that could be served, on an annual basis, by a supply of the same size as the reduction in capacity of the Independent Source(s). In the event that this adjustment results in a negative Allowance, Water Utility shall pay Seattle an amount equal to the then-current ERU Fee multiplied by the (negative) Allowance multiplied by minus one. This amount shall be paid in annual installments over a period not to exceed five years. The Allowance shall be zero upon commencement of these payments.

 iv.  Monthly Payment of Facilities Charges . Water Utility shall pay FCs based on the number of ERUs added during the previous month determined by the number of meters installed. Until the Allowance is zero, the Allowance shall be reduced by one for each ERU added by Water Utility during the previous month, and such reduction of the Allowance shall be in lieu of payment of an FC for that ERU.

 v.  Seattle Report on ERUs . Seattle shall prepare and distribute a report no later than March 31st of each year showing the ERU count of the Seattle Retail Distribution System and each Wholesale Customer on such basis for the previous year and each year since the effective date of this contract.]

 e.  Rate Setting . The structure of FCs or water rates charged to the holders of Full and Partial Requirements Contracts shall be determined by Seattle, at its sole discretion, except that the price may not, without the consent of Water Utility, be set to collect more than the costs forecast under Section IV hereof and Rate of Return on Investment. FCs shall be calculated as set forth on page 1 of Exhibit VI.

 9.  Cost Audit . At the end of each fiscal year, Seattle shall provide a statement of actual costs allocated to each cost pool and other costs and revenues received, which statement may be audited by an external auditor selected by the Operating Board. In addition, Water Utility may have the statement audited by an external auditor of its choice, solely at Water Utility's expense.

 10.  Transition .

 a.  Settling the Purveyor Balance Account . The parties agree that they will settle the Purveyor Balance Account, as that term is used in Section III.I of the 1982 Water Purveyor Contract, in the following manner no later than December 31, 2011, unless the parties enter into a payment agreement in accordance with this subsection. The Purveyor Balance Account shall be credited if there is a surplus or charged if there is a deficit, to the Wholesale Customers who remained under the 1982 Water Purveyor Contract until the Effective Date of this contract. The Purveyor Balance Account as of December 31, 2010 (which will be finally audited in the 3rd quarter of 2011), shall be prorated by each of those Wholesale Customer's share of the total Purveyor demand (e.g flow) since the most recent year that the balance was at zero. There will be separate prorations for the Old Water and New Water accounts as those terms are defined in the 1982 Water Purveyor Contract. In the event the appropriate credits or charges are not or cannot be paid in full by December 31, 2011, the parties shall be entitled to pay the appropriate credits or charges over a term of up to three years with the then current interest at Seattle's Average Cost of Debt. The specific terms of any payment agreement between the parties shall be reasonable and subject to the review and approval of the parties.

 b.  Prior Operating Board Decisions . Water Utility acknowledges and agrees it will be bound by decisions the Operating Board has made under the authority in this contract that have been made prior to the Effective Date of this contract so that such decisions apply to all holders of Full and Partial Requirements Contracts.

 c.  Application of Facilities Charges based on Meter or Connection Size . Seattle and Water Utility acknowledge and agree that Water Utility has unresolved concerns relating to guidance issued by the Operating Board in 2002 regarding the application of FCs based on meter or connection size where other requirements (e.g. operational, regulatory) may dictate the meter or connection size, and therefore, may not be an appropriate indicator of the annual demand placed on water supplies. The parties agree that circumstances have changed since that guidance was issued that warrant reconsideration of the guidance. Therefore, Seattle will initiate a discussion with the Operating Board in 2011, which Water Utility may participate in to present its concerns, and will endeavor to resolve the issue for action by the Operating Board as soon as practicable after Water Utility becomes represented by the Operating Board.

 d.  Waiver of Facilities Charges . Seattle shall not charge Water Utility FCs until January 1, 2012 if the amount of water it purchases from Seattle does not exceed its old water allowance under the 1982 Water Purveyor Contract. This waiver, however, shall not relieve Water Utility from the record-keeping requirement of subsection IV.E.8 above.

 e.  Transition Growth Surcharge . A transition growth surcharge of $0.60 per CCF shall be applied to the rates of Water Utility for delivery of water in excess of the old water allowance of the 1982 Water Purveyor Contract through December 31, 2011. The revenue from this surcharge shall be used to discount the base rates of the holders of Full and Partial Requirements Contracts by not more than $0.16 per CCF. In the event that the revenues generated by the surcharge exceed those required to fund the discount, Seattle may keep the difference.

 f.  Early Contract Signing Fee . Within two months of the Effective Date of this contract, Water Utility agrees to pay to Seattle an Early Contract Signing Fee of $__________________. If a Wholesale Customer requires a longer period, they may pay the fee in monthly increments until December 2011 at 1% interest.

 g.  Transfer to Full and Partial Rates and Facilities Charges .

 i. Within two months of the Effective Date of this contract, Seattle will: 1) make appropriate changes to its billing system to charge Water Utility for water supplied under this contract at the then current rates for Full or Partial Requirements Contracts under Seattle Municipal Code ("SMC") Section 21.04.440.E.2 ("Billing System Change Date"); and 2) credit back to Water Utility the difference between the amount Water Utility paid for water supplied at the then current rates for Water Purveyor Contracts under SMC 21.04.440.E.1 and what the Water Utility would have paid for water supplied at the then current rates for Full or Partial Requirements Contracts under SMC 21.04.440.E.2 from January 1, 2011 until the Billing System Change Date.

 ii. Within two months of the Effective Date of this contract, Water Utility will submit to Seattle an accounting of the number of retail connections made to its water system between January 1, 2011 and the Effective Date of the contract and payment of any FCs at the then current FC rate under SMC 21.04.440.E.2 that would have been paid in accordance with this contract from January 1, 2011 until the Effective Date of this contract.

 h.  Existing Regional Deficit . The parties acknowledge and agree that as of December 31, 2010, there may be an existing regional deficit or surplus in the running balance under Section IV.I.1 that was created by Wholesale Customers signing contracts prior to 2011 and the Seattle Regional Distribution System. Although Water Utility did not contribute to the existing deficit or surplus, it will have to pay higher or lower rates in the 2012-2014 rate period to help eliminate the deficit or surplus, respectively. In the event of a deficit, Seattle agrees to credit back to Water Utility, 70% of the amount that Water Utility will contribute to eliminating the existing deficit through higher rates. In the event of a surplus, Water Utility agrees to pay Seattle 70% of the amount that Water Utility will benefit from eliminating the existing surplus through lower rates. The actual amount of the existing deficit or surplus will be determined during the annual cost audit process for 2010, which is targeted for third quarter 2011. The amount to be credited or charged will be based on Water Utility's percentage of 2010 annual flow times the total existing regional deficit or surplus times 70%. Upon the completion of the 2010 annual cost audit process, Seattle will provide Water Utility with an accounting of the total credit or charge in writing. Beginning January 2012, Seattle will provide one or more monthly credits or charges on Water Utility's water bill until the entire credit or charge balance is paid off. Seattle or Water utility, as appropriate, will pay the entire balance by December 31, 2012. Any outstanding credit or charge balance will accrue interest at Seattle's average cost of debt from December 31, 2010 until the entire balance is paid off.

 IV.F. Elective Services

 1.  Water Supply Services . Seattle may provide certain elective services (e.g. conservation, engineering) to Water Utility upon request by Water Utility. Such services shall be negotiated and contracted for separately between Water Utility and Seattle.

 2.  Transmission Wheeling . In consultation with the Operating Board, excess transmission capacity may be made available by Seattle for a fee for purposes of wheeling water between points within the Seattle Regional Water Supply System to Water Utility or to others.

 3.  Water Quality . So long as Seattle owns and operates a water quality lab, Water Utility may request the services of that lab based on its published rates.

 IV.G. Rate Adjustment

 1.  Rate Adjustment . Upon 120-days notice to Water Utility of its intent to do so, Seattle may adjust water service rates and FCs to Water Utility subject to the terms of this contract. Rate adjustments will be effected only within five years of the completion of a cost of service study to be conducted by Seattle, which shall include an analysis of the allocation of operation, maintenance and capital costs between cost pools. Such study shall be prepared in accordance with accepted industry standards. In addition, Seattle shall review the Operating Board's comments and recommendations on the rate proposal and provide a written explanation of any recommendations that are not accepted.

 2.  Rate Consultant . An independent rate consultant shall be selected by Seattle in consultation with the Operating Board. Detailed information and progress reports from the consultant will be made to Water Utility during the course of the study upon drafting of each major study section directly affecting Water Utility and other Wholesale Customers. A final consultant report shall be made available to Water Utility not less than 30 days before Seattle formally transmits any resulting rate adjustment proposal to the Operating Board.

 IV.H. Retail Rate-Setting

 Each party to this contract shall have sole authority for establishing retail rates, connection charges and other fees and charges within its respective jurisdiction.

 IV.I. Truing Actual Costs and Actual Revenues

 A mechanism for reconciling revenue targets for the various cost pools and the actual revenues received during each year shall be implemented by Seattle as follows:

 1. For each previously identified class of customers in each cost pool, Seattle shall maintain a running balance of the excess or deficit of actual rate revenues collected less actual expenses incurred. Each balance shall earn simple interest at the rate of Seattle's Average Cost of Debt. At the end of each year, each balance shall be adjusted to reflect the operating results of that year. The statement of these balances shall be reviewed and approved by an external auditor.

 2. FC balances shall be carried forward as set forth in Section IV.E.6.

 3. Each wholesale rate study shall adjust rates to eliminate the cost pool balances. ERU fees shall be based on the costs of increments in supply and transmission capacity, and shall not be adjusted to reflect surpluses or deficits in FC revenues.

 SECTION V. OPERATING BOARD

 1.  Purpose . The purpose of the Operating Board is to provide certain limited authority to a board of representatives over policy and operational matters as they affect the Seattle Regional Water Supply System.

 2.  Structure and Authority . The Operating Board shall have the powers and authority as set forth herein. Exhibit IV describes the structure and authority of the Operating Board. In the event of a conflict between provisions of this contract which grant specific powers to the Operating Board and Exhibit IV, such grants of specific powers shall control.

 3.  Review . The structure and authority of the Operating Board may be reviewed as of January 1, 2012 and every five years thereafter to determine its effectiveness in addressing regional and contractual issues. The review may address the composition of the Board and its powers and authority as set forth herein and in Exhibit IV, provided that notwithstanding any other term or provision of this contract, Seattle shall not have the power to disband the Operating Board nor take away or diminish the powers vested in the Operating Board as set forth in Sections II, III and IV of this contract. Either party may initiate the review. The reviewing party shall provide the other with its comments and proposals. The parties agree to consider the other party's comments and proposals and to respond in writing stating its reasons for rejecting any proposals and the reasons for its own counter-proposal. After consideration of all comments and proposals at each five year interval, Seattle may make changes in the structure and authority of the Operating Board that are not inconsistent with the provisions of this subsection.

 SECTION VI. PLANNING

 VI.A. Reporting of Planning Data

 1. By no later than April 1 of each year, Water Utility shall report to Seattle and the Operating Board as follows:

 a. Its annual and peak day total system demand for each year, during the term of this contract, as of December 31st of the previous year.

 b. Its forecast of Full or Partial Water Requirements, as appropriate, for the year including estimates of annual water consumption and maximum 24-peak demand for the ensuing calendar year, and for the fifth, tenth, and fifteenth year in the future. Such forecasts shall reflect the best judgment of Water Utility.

 2. Water Utility shall report other data relating to water supply and demand as may be reasonably requested by Seattle for water planning purposes.

 3. Records relevant to water supply and consumption within the possession of Seattle or Water Utility shall be provided to the other upon reasonable request.

 VI.B. Submittal of Water Utility Water System Plans

 Water Utility shall provide a copy of its water system plan, including any amendments, to Seattle for review.

 VI.C. Seattle as Water Planning Agency

 Seattle shall be the lead agency and primary planning authority for the purposes of fulfilling its obligations to provide for the Full or Partial Water Requirements of Water Utility, as appropriate. Seattle, in consultation with the Operating Board, shall examine and investigate water supplies suitable and adequate to meet the present and reasonable future needs of Seattle and the Wholesale Customers. Seattle shall prepare and adopt a plan for acquiring such water supplies in a timely fashion. The plan shall provide for the lands, waters, water rights and easements necessary therefor, and facilities for retaining, storing and delivering such waters, including dams, reservoirs, aqueducts and pipelines to convey same throughout the Seattle Regional Water Supply System. In preparing or adopting the plan, Seattle shall consider as possible alternatives or additional water supply sources, the acquisition of water from sources controlled or developed by individual water utilities, legally constituted groups of water utilities or utilities which are not presently supplied by the Seattle Regional Water Supply System. Seattle has final responsibility for the plan and for fulfilling the obligations of this contract. However, the Operating Board may participate in developing the plan by proposing goals and objectives for the Seattle Regional Water Supply System, by making any additional suggestions and by acting in a review capacity.

 VI.D. Comprehensive Capital Facilities Plan

 Before ordering any major improvements to fulfill the requirements of this contract, Seattle shall adopt and maintain a comprehensive capital facilities plan for the Seattle Regional Water Supply System, which provides for such improvements. Any capital facilities plan adopted by Seattle for the Seattle Regional Water Supply System shall comply with and implement the Rate-making and Cost Allocation Principles in Section IV.A of this contract. This plan shall identify any reasonable costs for capital improvements to alleviate a disproportionate adverse impact to the distribution system(s) of Water Utility, another Wholesale Customer represented on the Operating Board or Seattle, to the extent it is caused by a capital improvement in the capital facilities plan for the Seattle Regional Water Supply System. When such plan is updated or amended, it shall be reviewed by the Operating Board prior to submission to the Seattle City Council. The Operating Board shall respond within 60 days of receipt of the plan, or its approval shall be presumed to be given. The response submitted by the Operating Board regarding facilities substantially affecting Water Utility and other Wholesale Customers shall be seriously considered by Seattle. Seattle shall reply to the Operating Board within 90 days with its comments. The Operating Board and Seattle shall use their best efforts to arrive at a mutually acceptable plan.

 VI.E. Emergency Planning

 An emergency plan shall be prepared and maintained by Seattle as part of its Water System Plan to provide for water supply in the event of drought or disaster. Such plan shall be prepared pursuant to the procedure outlined in Section VI.D. Water Utility shall use reasonable efforts to comply with the provisions of such plan, or alternatively, Water Utility may adopt its own emergency plan if it believes it is prudent to do so.

 SECTION VII. PAYMENT

 VII.A. Collection of Money Due City

 Seattle shall bill Water Utility on a monthly basis for all charges due under this contract. Water Utility shall pay such charges within 60 days of the billing date.

 VII.B. Penalties for Late Payment

 EXHIBIT III

 DEMAND CHARGE METHODOLOGY

 The policy of Seattle Public Utilities is to supply water to its Wholesale Customers at, as near as is practical, the twenty-four hour average flow rate, during the peak demand season (June through August). To comply, the Wholesale Customers have to construct adequate storage volume within their individual systems, or sometimes collectively, so as to avoid excessive peak flow withdrawals from the Seattle Transmission Facilities. The Demand Metering Program is established to set performance standards, and to monitor the Wholesale Customer's compliance with this policy. If an individual Water Utility exceeds the prescribed threshold, a "demand charge" is calculated.

 Except where other agreements supersede the provisions of this contract, each Water Utility shall be subject to a demand charge based on effective deficient storage, as determined by the peak instantaneous flow rate, and the equivalent financing costs to provide storage. The demand charge rate (i.e., dollars per 1000 gallons of deficient storage) shall be based on the equivalent cost of providing the deficient storage. This rate will be determined as part of each rate study.

 The Demand Metering Program is charged with implementation of the "demand charge" methodology. It shall be the responsibility of Seattle, in consultation with the Operating Board, to determine the appropriate means to achieve the program's purpose. The options that may be considered range from temporary suspension on a year by year basis to full activation, as described below.

 There shall be no requirement for Seattle to install demand- metering equipment at each Service Connection in order to assess a demand charge. Seattle may choose to apply "demand metering" selectively to certain parts of the Seattle Transmission Facilities that are designated as "critical" from the standpoint of hydraulic capacity or other operational considerations. Seattle may choose to apply "demand metering" intermittently in various parts of the Seattle Transmission Facilities for the purpose of monitoring for compliance by individual Wholesale Customers or groups of Wholesale Customers on a given line segment.

 EXHIBIT IV

 OPERATING BOARD STRUCTURE

 1.  Structure . The Operating Board (or "Board") shall be structured as follows:

 a. The Board shall consist of seven (7) members, composed of three members representing Seattle Public Utilities (SPU), three members representing Seattle's Wholesale Customers selected as described below and one independent party selected as set forth below to be a tie-breaker as needed. Board members shall, to the best of their ability, act in the best interests of the Seattle Regional Water Supply System as a whole and shall not represent the interest of a group of utilities or an individual utility.

 b. The term of each Board position shall commence on January 1 and shall be for four (4) years. Terms of each Board position shall be staggered such that no more than two positions are renewed in any single year. Board members may serve not more than three successive terms.

 c. Three Board members representing the Wholesale Customers will be selected from the holders of Full and Partial Requirements Contracts . Wholesale Customers will be sorted into three categories based on utility size. The selected categories will be small, medium and large utilities, which will be made up from approximately equal numbers of holders of Full and Partial Requirements Contracts. Each category of utility may elect, by majority vote (one vote per utility) its representative to the Operating Board. The Board will be recomposed on January 1, 2012 and every 5 years thereafter.

 d. The seventh member of the Board shall be a person having expertise in the operations of regional water supply systems. Such person shall be selected by majority vote of the other Board members. In the event of a deadlock in selecting the independent representative, the independent Board member shall be selected by Judicial Arbitration and Mediation Services Inc., of Seattle, Washington or its successor. The seventh member shall not vote on issues coming before the Board unless there is a deadlock in the voting among the other six Board members. The seventh member may nevertheless express his or her opinions in Operating Board discussions. Such member shall have no employment, financial or contractual relationship with Seattle nor any Wholesale Customer or any other actual or apparent conflict of interest in holding this position.

 2.  Voting . Except as otherwise provided above, each member of the Board shall have one vote on all matters coming before the Board. Each Board member may appoint an alternate to vote in his or her absence. A quorum of four (4) Board members present shall be required for any vote. Members of the Board may not grant proxies for any vote.

 3.  Chairperson . the Board shall have a Chairperson who will be selected and have duties as defined below:

 b. the Chairperson shall be selected at the first regularly scheduled meeting of each new year.

 c. All Chairpersons shall be selected by the Board using a nomination and voting process.

 d. Nomination for the position of Chairperson shall be taken from Board members. The Chairperson shall be selected based upon the simple majority vote of Board members. Should the Board fail to elect a Chairperson at the first regularly scheduled meeting of the new year, a designated representative from SPU shall be the Acting Chairperson until such time as the Board elects a Chairperson.

 e. The Chairperson shall have the responsibility to call meetings, determine the agenda and preside over meetings. In the absence of the Chairperson, for whatever reason, a designated representative from SPU shall be the Acting Chairperson for that meeting. The Chairperson shall also act as the spokesperson for the Board and liaison between the Administrator and the Seattle City Council's Committee on Seattle Public Utilities & Neighborhoods or successor committees.

 4.  Schedule/Procedures . The Board shall adopt a regular meeting schedule and notify all Wholesale Customers of the schedule. The Operating Board may adopt it own internal procedures. The latest edition of Roberts Rules of Order shall, in the absence of agreement by the Operating Board on procedural matters, govern all meetings and votes of the Operating Board.

 5.  Reporting . The Board will provide reports to the Wholesale Customers and to the Seattle City Council Committee on Seattle Public Utilities & Neighborhoods, or successor City Council committee, on its decisions and recommendations in a timely manner.

 6.  Responsibilities and Authority of the Board . Where no clear responsibility or authority on an issue is established in this contract the responsibility and authority shall rest with the Seattle City Council.

 7.  Expenses . The Board shall be authorized to incur reasonable expenses which will be allocated by the Board to either or both of the New Transmission or Supply Cost Pools.

 EXHIBIT V - RESERVED

 EXHIBIT VI

 Calculation of ERU's as a Part of Facilities Charges

 The ERU Fee is:

 * the flat debt service payment required to finance the facility providing the ERU over the lesser of (i) the facility life or (ii) the period over which new demand will fully utilize the facility's supply

 - divided by -

 * the number of new ERU's of demand expected in each year.

 Seattle's Average Cost of Debt shall be used as the interest rate in this calculation. In the event that several New Supply Resources are added simultaneously, the facilities may be considered together as providing a total new supply capacity for a total construction cost.

 Example: A new facility costing $100 million is built with a capacity of 100,000 ERU's. Growth of 5,000 ERU's per year is expected over the next 20 years, so the facility is projected to be supplying its full capacity in 20 years. Were this facility financed over 20 years at 6% interest, the flat annual debt service payment would be $8.7 million. Each ERU would cost 0.02% of this annual amount, or about $1,740.

 At the time a New Supply Resources is added, the ERU price for this supply shall be calculated. This ERU price shall then be averaged with the then-current ERU Fee. This average shall be weighted by the number of unpurchased ERU's available at the then-current ERU fee and the number of new ERU's being added at the new ERU price. This weighted average shall be the new ERU Fee, and the number of ERU's available at the fee shall be the sum of the unsold ERU's at the previous fee and the ERU capacity of the new facility.

 Example: 10 years ago, a $100 million facility was constructed that can supply 100,000 ERU's. Growth and demand projections have proven accurate, and now 50,000 ERU's have been purchased, each for $1,740. The facility also has an additional 50,000 ERU's still available at the same price. This year, we construct a facility worth $70 million, with a capacity of 40,000 ERU's. Based on demand projections, this facility (on its own) would be fully utilized in 10 years, and its ERU price is therefore $2,375. The average price of any of the 90,000 available ERU's is therefore $2,022.

 ERU Proving Methodology

 The size of the water service connection used to serve an establishment depends upon both the total demand of that establishment and the instantaneous flow required by that establishment. For this reason, connection size is only a general indicator of the annual demand placed on water supplies by the establishment.

 Water Utility Independent Sources of Supply

 Water Utility operates the following independent sources of supply (each an "Independent Source"):

<table><tr><td>Source Description

</td><td>Average Annual Production

</td><td>Allowance

</td></tr>

<tr><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr>

<tr><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr>

</table> Water Utility shall use its best efforts to maintain and operate the Independent Sources in order to maintain their annual production capacity as listed above. Water Utility shall provide written notice to Seattle within thirty days of determining that it is not possible or not cost effective to maintain and operate an Independent Source at its listed production levels. Such written notice shall describe the new level of production expected for Independent Source, and shall trigger a decrease in the Allowance under Section IV.E.8.d.  Water Utility shall use its best efforts to cure any interruption of water supply from an Independent Source, shall provide oral notice to Seattle of an interruption of an Independent Source lasting longer than 1 week, and shall provide information on the expected additional demand for water deliveries from Seattle resulting from the interruption. Water Utility shall use its best efforts to minimize the impact of an interruption of an Independent Source on the Seattle Regional Water Supply System by utilizing its other Independent Sources unaffected by the interruption within their operating and maintenance constraints.

 It is the intent of the parties that the production capacities listed in this Exhibit fairly represent the production capability of the Independent Sources. In the event that, over a five year period, (i) the actual total annual production, as may be adjusted to reflect a a reasonably unforeseeable interruption in Water Utility's Independent Source that lasts a substantial amount of time and is cured within a reasonable time, of the Independent Sources is consistently less than represented in this Exhibit, and (ii) the annual deliveries of water to Water Utility by Seattle are consistently increasing, the capacities of the Independent Sources listed in this Exhibit shall be reduced, and the reduction shall trigger a decrease in the Allowance under Section IV.E.8.d.

 Attachment B -- Emergency Intertie Agreement between Seattle Public Utilities and [Wholesale Customer]

 EMERGENCY INTERTIE AGREEMENT

 BETWEEEN

 SEATTLE PUBLIC UTILITIES

 AND

 \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

 This Agreement is made and entered into this\_\_\_\_ day of \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_, 20\_\_ by and between the City of Seattle, a Washington municipal corporation, acting through its Seattle Public Utilities ("SPU") and \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_, a Washington municipal corporation ("Water Utility").

 WHEREAS, SPU and Water Utility each own and operate public water supply systems ("Water System") within their respective service areas in accordance with the laws of the State of Washington; and

 WHEREAS, Water Utility has requested that SPU provide it with an emergency back-up water supply through an existing intertie connection between SPU's and Water Utility's Water Systems, which will increase reliability for operating Water Utility's Water System during temporary periods when its Water System is impaired or disrupted; and

 WHEREAS, SPU agrees to use its best efforts to provide Water Utility an emergency back-up water supply under certain terms and conditions from its available existing sources of water supply.

 NOW THEREFORE, both parties agree as follows:

 1.  TERM : The initial term of this Agreement shall be for fifty (50) years commencing on January 1, 2012 and expiring on December 31, 2062.

 2.  DESCRIPTION OF EMERGENCY INTERTIE : SPU will deliver water to Water Utility through service connection(s), which include the water meter and appurtenances ("Emergency Intertie"), as described below and as more particularly described, including the location(s ) and specific operating conditions, in Exhibit I, a copy of which is attached and incorporated herein. Exhibit I may be revised in writing upon mutual agreement of the Director of SPU and the \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ of Water Utility, except that SPU may modify the minimum hydraulic gradient once during any fifteen (15) year period upon four (4) years' advance written notice, unless a shorter notice is agreed to by Water Utility. SPU Facilities include: the outlet from the supply pipeline, the pipeline from the outlet to the meter vault, and the meter vault and its contents. Water Utility Facilities include: everything past the external wall of the meter vault. SPU will provide water for use at the Emergency Intertie at any time except as otherwise allowed by the terms of this Agreement.

 3.  USE OF EMERGENCY INTERTIE : Water Utility's use of the Emergency Intertie is limited to temporary, emergency backup water supply for up to one week, unless SPU approves a longer period in writing, which will not be unreasonably withheld. The parties agree that in the event a substantially longer period is approved, the Director of SPU may require additional reasonable terms and conditions that will be in effect during the approved longer period. For the purposes of this Agreement, an emergency means an unforeseen event that causes damage or disrupts Water Utility's normal operations of its Water System or requires immediate action to protect public health and safety, which includes fire flow purposes.

 4.  LIMITATIONS ON USE OF EMERGENCY INTERTIE :

 a. The Emergency Intertie may not be used to respond to routine or seasonal peak demands or water shortages.

 b. Before using the Emergency Intertie, Water Utility shall use best efforts to activate its own emergency sources of supply or alternative operations to cope with the emergency.

 c. SPU will provide water at the point of delivery in accordance with this Agreement during use of the Emergency Intertie as defined in Exhibit I, as revised from time to time.

 d. Water Utility will endeavor to not exceed flows defined in Exhibit I during use of the Emergency Intertie without specific written authorization by SPU.

 e. Water Utility may use up to the number of gallons of water per year through the Emergency Intertie identified in Exhibit 1 for administrative purposes only, such as hydrant or valve exercising/testing, flushing or other measures taken to maintain water quality, which is included as part of the Annual Fee ("Administrative Allowance"). The Director of SPU and the \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ of Water Utility may revise the Administrative Allowance in Exhibit I as necessary, upon mutual written agreement between the Director of SPU and \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ of Water Utility.

 f. Water Utility agrees and acknowledges that in the event of a general emergency or weather-related water shortage affecting SPU's Water System, SPU may interrupt or reduce its deliveries of water to its wholesale customers (except for fire protection), including Water Utility under this Agreement.

 g. Water Utility agrees and acknowledges that in the event of a general emergency or weather-related water shortage affecting SPU's Water System or the region, SPU may implement emergency water use curtailment measures that impact Water Utility's retail customers' use of water in accordance with its Water Shortage Contingency Plan or other necessary action. Water Utility will assist and support any emergency curtailment measures that are implemented and related to use of the Emergency Intertie.

 h. Water Utility agrees and acknowledges that SPU may temporarily interrupt use or reduce availability of water through the Emergency Intertie if SPU determines that the interruption or reduction is necessary or reasonable in case of a localized or SPU Water System emergency or in order to perform any required maintenance, improvement, repair, inspection or testing of SPU's Water System. Except in cases of emergency affecting SPU's Water System, SPU will provide Water Utility reasonable notice of any temporary interruptions or reductions and will endeavor to minimize interruptions and reductions of water available through the Emergency Intertie, especially when the Emergency Intertie is in active use by Water Utility. In the case of emergency, SPU will provide Water Utility notice as soon as practicable.

 5.  NOTIFICATION : Whenever general notice is required or prudent under this Agreement, notice shall be giving to the following representatives, which may be amended in writing:

 SPU: Water Utility:

 Wholesale Contracts Manager \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

 PO Box 34018 \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

 Seattle, WA 98124-4018 \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

 206-733-9815 \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

 Email: first name.last name@seattle.gov Email:\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

 a. Water Utility will verbally notify SPU Operations Control Center at 206-386-1818 whenever the Emergency Intertie is used for emergency use. Water Utility will endeavor to notify SPU within 1 hour after the use of the Emergency Intertie begins, or as soon as practicable, and will state the nature of the emergency and estimated/actual duration.

 b. Water Utility will send written notice to SPU Wholesale Contracts Manager at the address above within 10 days after each use of the Emergency Intertie, in a form acceptable to SPU, stating the duration and estimated quantity of water use.

 6.  WATER QUALITY : SPU will provide water to the point of delivery that meets all state and federal drinking water standards and shall be of the same standard and quality as that normally delivered by SPU to its retail and wholesale customers. Water Utility acknowledges and agrees that because the Emergency Intertie is used intermittently, it may result in water being stagnant at the point of delivery for periods of time that may affect water quality. Water Utility is solely responsible for implementing operational best practices, such as flushing the service connection, prior to use of the Emergency Intertie for potable or other use. Water Utility is solely responsible for compliance with all applicable local, state and federal drinking water quality laws and regulations within its Water System.

 7.  INTERTIE MAINTENANCE : Each utility shall be responsible for maintenance of their portion of the Emergency Intertie as described in Section 2 of this Agreement as SPU and Water Utility Facilities respectively.

 8.  METER EQUIPMENT : SPU shall own, maintain and pay the cost of the metering equipment for the Emergency Intertie, including periodic inspection and testing. If Seattle changes the location of the intertie connection to Water Utility for Seattle's benefit, then Seattle shall pay the cost of constructing a new wholesale meter installation at the new location. If Water Utility requests the change in location, then Water Utility shall pay the cost of the new connection.

 9.  EMERGENCY INTERTIE FEES : Water Utility will pay the following charges within 30 days of an invoice from SPU:

 a. An Annual Fee, paid in advance by January 1 of each calendar year, which covers SPU's expenses to administer this Agreement and the Administrative Allowance for Water Utility under Section 4.e and Exhibit 1 of this Agreement. The Director of SPU may revise the Annual Fee reasonably to account for any change in the Administrative Allowance mutually agreed under Section 4.e above. Each year during the term of this Agreement, the Director of SPU may revise the Annual Fee by the same percentage as the change in the average of the Peak and Off-Peak Commodity Charge Rates from the prior year to the current year then in effect for wholesale customers under Seattle Municipal Code Section 21.04.440.E.2, as it may be amended from time to time. The initial Annual Fee due January 1, 2012 is $\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_. SPU will provide 30 days' written notice of any subsequent revisions to the Annual Fee, which will become incorporated herein by this reference at the time the revised Annual Fee becomes effective.

 b. A Commodity Charge for the metered amount of water used through the Emergency Intertie minus the Administrative Allowance at the then applicable average of the Peak and Off-Peak Commodity Charge Rates in effect for wholesale customers under Seattle Municipal Code Section 21.04.440.E.2, as it may be amended from time to time, plus any emergency surcharge, if applicable generally to the wholesale customers at that time.

 c. A one-time transaction fee of $1500 is due January 1, 2012.

 d. Any late payment will accrue interest at 1% per month.
