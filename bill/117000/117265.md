 ORDINANCE _________________

 AN ORDINANCE relating to Seattle Department of Parks and Recreation; authorizing the Superintendent of Parks and Recreation to enter into an easement agreement granting and conveying a permanent subsurface tunnel easement under portions of the Cheasty Greenspace to the Central Puget Sound Regional Transit Authority and to accept payment therefor; finding that the grant of a permanent subsurface tunnel easement meets the requirements of Ordinance 118477, adopting Initiative 42, to the extent applicable; ratifying and confirming the grant of temporary surface rights on portions of the Cheasty Greenspace to the Central Puget Sound Regional Transit Authority for temporary construction purposes and authorizing acceptance of payment therefor; and exempting the grant of temporary surface rights from the requirements of Ordinance 118477, to the extent applicable.

 WHEREAS, in 1998 the Seattle City Council approved Ordinance 118927, which authorized the Mayor to execute a Memorandum of Agreement for Intergovernmental Cooperation for the Central Light Rail Transit Line ("MOA") with the Central Puget Sound Regional Transit Authority ("Sound Transit") relating to light rail system development and station area planning within Seattle; and

 WHEREAS, the MOA identified common objectives of the City of Seattle ("City") and Sound Transit including but not limited to the following: development of a light rail system that effectively serves the transportation needs of citizens in the city and surrounding service area in a manner consistent with regional service goals within the budget and schedule adopted by Sound Transit; expedite review of necessary City approvals, minimize conflicts regarding such approvals, and quickly resolve such conflicts that do arise; and build effective, ongoing intergovernmental cooperation between Sound Transit and the City; and

 WHEREAS, on April 10, 2000, the Seattle City Council adopted Resolution 30128, which approved the alignment, location of stations, and maintenance base location for the light rail system; and

 WHEREAS, the alignment of the light rail system, as described in the Central Link Light Rail Beacon Hill Tunnel Plans (Contract # C710), passes below the surface of portions of the Cheasty Greenspace; and

 WHEREAS, in order to meet Sound Transit's construction schedule, Sound Transit and the City entered into a Right of Entry Agreement (BH009) on March 30, 2004, as extended by letter agreement on November 3, 2004, for the temporary occupancy of surface portions of the Cheasty Greenspace and construction of a subsurface tunnel for the light rail system, as described in the Central Link Light Rail Beacon Hill Tunnel Plans (Contract # C710); and

 WHEREAS, Sound Transit has finished construction and currently operates its light rail system known as the Central Link Light Rail Project; and

 WHEREAS, the City and Sound Transit have agreed on the terms and fair market value of the subsurface tunnel easement and the fair market value of the temporary surface rights for construction purposes; and

 WHEREAS, the City Council has held a public hearing in accordance with the requirements of Section 3 of Ordinance 118477, adopting Initiative 42; NOW, THEREFORE,

 BE IT ORDAINED BY THE CITY OF SEATTLE AS FOLLOWS:

 Section 1. The City Council hereby finds that the sale of a permanent subsurface tunnel easement under a portion of the Cheasty Greenspace to the Central Puget Sound Regional Transit Authority ("Sound Transit") for the operation of Sound Transit's Central Link Light Rail Project ("Project") is necessary because there is no reasonable and practical alternative and such subsurface easement is compatible with park use, thereby meeting the requirements of Ordinance 118477, to the extent applicable. To the extent that Ordinance 118477 is applicable to the grant of temporary surface rights on a portion of the Cheasty Greenspace to Sound Transit in connection with the construction of the Project, the requirements of Ordinance 118477 are hereby superseded.

 Section 2. The Superintendent of Parks and Recreation, or his respective designee, is hereby authorized, on behalf of The City of Seattle, to enter into a Tunnel Easement Agreement with Sound Transit, substantially in the form of Attachment 1 attached hereto and incorporated by this reference, under the real property described in Attachment 1.

 Section 3. Consideration for the grant of temporary surface rights on a portion of the Cheasty Greenspace during construction of the Project and consideration for the permanent Tunnel Easement described in Attachment 1, paid by Sound Transit, shall be deposited as follows:

 TUNNEL EASEMENT AGREEMENT

 1.  Grant of Tunnel Easement . THE CITY OF SEATTLE, a Washington municipal corporation ("Grantor"), for and in consideration of Eight Thousand Four Hundred and No/100 Dollars ($8,400.00) in hand paid, hereby conveys to the CENTRAL PUGET SOUND REGIONAL TRANSIT AUTHORITY ("Grantee"), a regional transit authority of the State of Washington, for the purposes described below, an exclusive permanent subsurface easement (the "Tunnel Easement") under the surface of and through a portion of Grantor's property. Grantor's property ("Grantor's Property") and the subsurface portion of Grantor's Property that is subject to the Tunnel Easement ("Tunnel Easement Area") are legally described in Exhibit "A" attached hereto and incorporated herein and illustrated in Exhibit "B", all attached hereto and incorporated herein by reference. The

 Tunnel Easement Area shall be a subsurface easement lying vertically between two horizontal planes at elevation 125 feet and elevation 63 feet, based on the North American Vertical Datum of 1988 (NAVD88), the top plane being approximately 25 feet below ground surface (BGS).

 2.  Purpose of Tunnel Easement . Grantee shall have the right to use the Tunnel Easement Area for all purposes necessary or incidental to Grantee's construction, operation, maintenance, use, modification, repair and replacement of underground tunnels and related public transportation facilities, including but not limited to the right to construct, operate, maintain, modify, repair, replace, improve, remove, and use said tunnels, tunnel supports, roof, floor, and all utility lines or wires within said tunnels, together with the right to operate light rail trains and other public transportation vehicles and equipment within said tunnel, and for any related uses as Grantee may now or hereafter deem appropriate. All structures, materials, facilities, mechanical and electrical systems, utilities, equipment, furnishings, or improvements of any kind that are acquired, constructed, or installed in or upon the Tunnel Easement Area shall be and shall at all times remain the property of Grantee.

 3.  Grantor's Use of Tunnel Easement Area . Grantor shall not use any portion of the Tunnel Easement Area without the prior written consent of Grantee, which shall not be unreasonably withheld.

 4. Grantee's Use of Tunnel Easement Area . Grantee may use the Tunnel Easement Area for the purposes and in the manner described herein. Grantee's normal operation of its Link light rail project (the "Project") is not anticipated to cause noise or vibration noticeable upon Grantor's Property or to cause subsidence or damage of any kind to Grantor's Property. Grantee shall at all times maintain its improvements and facilities in the Tunnel Easement Area in good condition and repair and in accordance with all applicable laws and regulations and shall at all times maintain the structural integrity of the Tunnel Easement Area and the support of the surface of Grantor's Property. Grantee is responsible for all injury and damage, including consequential damage, to persons and property (real and personal) and improvements caused directly or indirectly by Grantee's exercise of Grantee's rights under this Tunnel Easement Agreement. Grantee's responsibility for such injury and damage shall include repair and restoration to original condition of any and all damage to the Grantor's real and personal property; and repair, replacement, or restoration to original condition of all damaged or destroyed structures, facilities, and improvements on the Grantor's Property, all at Grantee's sole cost and expense. In addition, if any voids are discovered within the Tunnel Easement Area or elsewhere within the predicted zone of influence of Grantee's tunneling activities, Grantee shall be responsible for expeditiously filling such voids and mitigating any related damage to Grantor's real or personal property.

 5.  Applicable Law and Indemnification . Grantee shall at all times exercise its rights under this Tunnel Easement Agreement in accordance with the requirements of all applicable laws, orders, rules, and regulations of any public authority having jurisdiction. In the event the impacts of Grantee's uses of the Tunnel Easement Area as described herein are demonstrated to be incorrect, or in the event of Grantee's failure to maintain structural integrity of the Tunnel Easement Area or support of the surface or subsurface of Grantor's Property, or in the event of injury or damage to persons or property resulting directly or indirectly from damage on or to Grantor's Property from Grantee's exercise of Grantee's rights under this Tunnel Easement Agreement, Grantee agrees to indemnify, hold harmless, and defend Grantor from and against all damages, claims, and liabilities to the extent resulting therefrom, including attorney's fees and costs of suit, including any appeals thereof, except to the extent any of such damages, claims, or liabilities result from the negligence of Grantor.

 6.  Binding Effect . The Tunnel Easement is appurtenant to and shall run with all real property now owned or hereafter acquired by Grantee as part of the Project, which includes underground tunnels and related facilities operated by Grantee for high capacity transportation system purposes and shall inure to the benefit of Grantee, its successors, and assigns and shall be binding upon the Grantor's Property and Grantor, and their respective heirs, successors, and assigns.
