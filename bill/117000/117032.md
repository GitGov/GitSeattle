</table> Notes to Table C-1:  1. For purposes of these land use fees, low-income housing is housing that both (1) satisfies the definition of "low-income housing" in SMC 23.84.024; and (2) where at least (( ~~fifty~~)) 50 percent of the total gross floor area of each structure on the site is committed to low-income housing use for at least 20 years.

 2. The single variance fee shall be applicable whether the project requires one (( ~~(1)~~)) or multiple variances.

 3. Includes short subdivisions in environmentally critical areas.

 4. Includes unit-lot subdivisions and full subdivisions in environmentally critical areas.

 5. This fee applies when design review is initiated only for tree protection and the application has no other review under Items 1 - 14.

 (( ~~6. The minimum fee is applied to the cost to fabricate, install and remove the environmental review sign. If the sign is removed or defaced before the final City decision the applicant will be responsible for paying the vendor contracted with the City to repair or replace the sign.~~))

 (( ~~7.~~)) 6.  The fees for interpretations of SMC Chapters 25.12, 25.20, 25.22, and 25.24 shall be collected by the Director of the Department of Neighborhoods.

 (( ~~8.~~)) 7.  Additional notice may be given in circumstances including but not limited to the following: reinstallation of environmental review signs, reposting of the land use review or environmental signs, new component reviews added subsequent to the original notice, revised decisions, and changes to the scope of the project.

 (( ~~9.~~)) 8.  The pre- application conference fee covers a one hour conference. Additional pre-application review time will be charged at the  Land Use  hourly rate. See also Section 22.900C.010.E .

 (( ~~10.~~)) 9.  Recording fees will be charged the current rate as established and charged by King County at the time of document recording.

 (( ~~1. Nonrefundable Fees. Fees for preapplication conferences and environmental signs are not refundable.~~

~~2. Calculating Refunds for Land Use Fees. The amount of land use review fee that may be refunded is calculated as follows.~~

~~a. For refunds requested before a required notice is complete, the amount eligible for refund is 75 percent of the minimum land use review fee plus 100 percent of the hourly deposit, if any, paid by the applicant.~~

~~b. For refunds requested after notice is complete and for applications for which notice is not required, the amount eligible for refund is the number of hours of review time multiplied by $250.00, subtracted from the amount paid by the applicant. The amount refunded shall not exceed 75 percent of the minimum land use review fee.~~))

 Section 12. Effective January 1, 2011, or on the effective date of this ordinance, if after January 1, 2011, Section 22.900D.010 of the Seattle Municipal Code, which Section was last amended by Ordinance 123246, is amended as follows:

 22.900D.010 Development permit fees .

 A. General.

 The development fee shall cover the application, review and inspection process associated with new construction, additions, alterations, and repairs to existing buildings and establishment of use. The development fee shall consist of a permit fee and, where plans are reviewed, a separate plan review fee. The permit fee and plan review fee shall be determined based on valuation, except as provided below.

 B. Time of Payment of Fees.

 Fees collected at the time of application will be based on Department estimates of the total fees due at the time of permit issuance. The final Department fees will be recalculated during review, and any additional amount due shall be collected prior to the issuance of the permit, approval, denial, decision or recommendation, provided that hourly fees may be collected earlier, as described in Section 22.900B.010 D.

 If, during the initial review, the previously-collected fee is determined to be less than 90 percent of the estimated fee, the review work subsequent to the initial review will not proceed until the discrepancy is paid to the Department.

 1. Amount Due Prior to Application. Fees for building pre- application conference  and any additional fees accrued after the conference shall be due prior to permit application. (( ~~shall be paid prior to the conference.~~)) See 22.900D.010 I for building pre- application conference fees.

 2. Amounts Due at Time of Application. The following amounts are due at the time of application:

 a. Applications for building and/or mechanical permits without plan review shall pay a fee for subject-to-field inspection (STFI) permits equal to the permit fee specified in Table D-2.

 b. Applications for building and/or mechanical permits with plan review shall pay the plan review fee plus (( ~~one-half (~~))1/2(( ~~)~~)) the permit fee as specified in Table D-2.

 i. For development permits approved to be issued in phases, the plan review fee plus 1/2 the permit fee due at the time of application of the first phased submittal shall be calculated based upon the value calculated in accordance with Section 22.900D.010. C for the entire scope of the development permit. The remaining portion of the permit fee will not be collected until issuance of the final phase of the development permit that completes the scope of the proposed building project.

 c. For other applications, the minimum fee shall be collected at the time of application.

 C. Determination of value.

 1. The Director shall determine the value of construction for which the permit is issued (the estimated current value of all labor and materials, whether actually paid or not, as well as all finish work, painting, roofing, electrical, plumbing, heating, air-conditioning, elevators, fire-extinguishing systems, automatic sprinkler systems, other mechanical systems, retaining walls, rockeries and any other permanent work or permanent equipment, but not including furnishings). The building valuation data from the International Code Council and other valuation criteria approved by the Director will be used to determine the value of construction.

 2. Dish or panel antennae. The fee for processing applications for installation of a dish or panel antenna shall be charged on the value of the foundation and supports constructed for the installation. The value of the dish or panel antenna shall not be included in the determination of value.

 3. The development fee for parks and playgrounds shall be based on the project value, including the value of improvements for structures incidental to the park or playground such as retaining walls, rockeries and restrooms, but shall not include the value of playground equipment.

 4. The valuation shall be based on the highest type of construction to which a proposed structure most nearly conforms, as determined by the Director.

 D. Phased permits.

 1. When a new building project is proposed to be built in phases and the Director determines that separate development permits may be issued for  approved  portions of the project, the development fee for (( ~~initial permits~~)) the entire permit  shall be based on the (( ~~estimated value of the work under that permit~~)) value of work  according to Table D-2  . If the shoring and/or(( ~~,except~~)) excavating (( ~~permits~~)) work is included with the complete foundation (below grade) phase of the building project, the fees for such work  shall be (( ~~based on Section 22.900D.145~~)) included in the fees described above . (( ~~The fee for the final permit shall be the fee based on the total value of the new building project minus the sum of the fees for the initial permits, with no credit for an excavation permit fee.~~))

 When the proposed building project includes a separate shoring and/or excavation phase that is not combined with the complete foundation (below grade) phase, the shoring and/or excavation work will be reviewed and issued as a separate permit. The fees for the excavation portion of that permit shall be based on Section 22.900D.145 and the fees for the shoring portion of that permit shall be based on the value of that structural portion of the work according to Table D-2. No credit will be given for any of these fees toward the phased building permit.

 2. In addition to the fee specified in 22.900.010 D 1 above, where an applicant requests division of an already-submitted permit application a fee shall be charged for each separate application (( ~~(including the original application which results from the division) as specified in Table D-2.~~)) as specified in Table D-2 and the fee to process this request will be charged at the DPD hourly rate.

 E. Calculation of Development Fees.

 The development fee for a permit shall be calculated as described in this section. Table D-1 establishes the Development Fee Index for value-based development fees. Except as specified in Section 22.900D.010 F below, Table D-2 establishes the permit fee and plan review fee, calculated as a percentage of the development fee index where determined by value. If two or more buildings are allowed under one (( ~~(1)~~)) permit, they shall be assessed fees as separate buildings under Table D-2. The individual fees shall then be added to determine the total development fee for the permit.

 22.900D.150 Electrical permit fees .

 A. Permit fees when plans and specifications are reviewed:

 1. Permit fees for electrical installations for which plans and specifications are reviewed by the Director shall be charged on a valuation basis as set forth in Table D-14.

 2. When approved by the Director to submit plans for advance plan examination, 50(( ~~%~~)) percent  of the estimated permit fee shall be collected at the time of the permit application and plan submittal.

 3. The Director shall determine the value of the construction, which is the value to the vendee of all labor, material, fittings, apparatus and the like, whether actually paid for or not, supplied by the permit holder and/or installed by the permit holder as a part of, or in connection with, a complete electrical system, but which does not include the cost of utilizing equipment connected to the electrical system. The Director may require verification of the stated cost of any work subject to these fees.

 When the cost of any proposed installation is unknown, an estimate of the cost shall be made and used to compute the permit fee.

 The permit fee specified in Table D-14 is due at the time of application. Upon completion of the installation, a fee adjustment may be made in favor of the City or the permit holder, if requested by either party.

 4. When a duplicate set of approved plans is submitted for examination and approval at any time after a permit has been issued on the original approved plans, hourly charges for Departmental work shall be assessed.

 B. Permit fees when plans and specifications are not required:

 1. Permit fees for electrical installations, additions and alterations for which plans and specifications are not required shall be as set forth in Table D-15. The permit fee specified in Table D-15 is due at the time of application.

 2. Permit fees for temporary electrical installations shall be charged for services only at the rate set forth in Table D-15.

 3. When the base fee and DPD hourly rate are used to calculate the fee in Table D-15, use Section 22.900B.010 to determine the permit fee.

 C. Phased permits:

 1. When an electrical project is proposed to be installed in phases and the Director determines that separate electrical permits may be issued for portions of the project, the permit fee for the initial permits shall be based on the estimated value of the work under that permit according to Table D-14. The fee for the final permit shall be the fee based on the total value of the electrical installations minus the sum of the values of the initial permits.

 2. Where an applicant requests that an application for a permit be divided into separate applications subsequent to the initial submittal of a unified application, an additional fee shall be charged at the rate of one (( ~~(1)~~))times the base fee for each separate application which results from the division.
