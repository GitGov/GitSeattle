 DEED RESTRICTIONS AND EASEMENTS

 The property will be encumbered by several easements to the City of Seattle. The map shows the extent of the easements. The easements can be grouped onto two areas as follows:

 Area One:

 An eight-foot easement adjoining our fence for SPU access and benefit.

 A ten-foot easement adjoining our fence for SPU security and health reasons (nothing including play structures or benches within this area).

 Area Two:

 Access and utilities easements along the gravel path (or road) for the benefit of SPU and any permitted parties that could access our reservoir property from the path/road. (SPU currently leases one cell site to T-Mobile and are considering leasing another communications facility. We want the lessees and their "assigns, agents, lessees" to access their facilities without traveling through the SPU's reservoir property.

 Deed restriction on the ravine portion giving SPU the right to view and approve any work on the ravine, any changes to the property or vegetation (This is applies only to the ravine on the northwesterly fence line in the narrow portion of the property.)

 Deed restriction requiring SPU's approval of any work in the gravel path/road and ravine areas (to protect the structural integrity of the reservoir) and any changes to the property or vegetation.

 Deed restriction requiring SPU's approval of any water, sewer, drain, etc lines in path/road and ravine areas. (This is applies only to the gravel path & ravine.) This applies to any excavation or installation of facilities.

 A road used for the development of the property can exist in the access and security easements along the reservoir fence line.
