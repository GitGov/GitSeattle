</table> 3.7. The CITY's design review and Street Use Permit processes will take place as follows:  3.7.1. The CITY review period begins on the Business Day following receipt by the CITY's Designated Representative of the Plan Review Package and ends when the CITY'S final comment document is submitted to WSDOT electronically in a Microsoft Excel document format. The CITY is responsible to assign appropriate staff to review and provide comment within the established timeframes.

 3.7.2. Following its review of the Progress Plan Review Package, SDOT will prepare and deliver to WSDOT draft Street Use Permit conditions. SDOT will update the draft conditions after completion of CITY's review of each subsequent Plan Review Package to enable incorporation of the draft conditions into WSDOT's construction contract documents.

 3.7.3. WSDOT will deliver the Plan Review Packages as further described in this Exhibit. If the CITY receives a submittal from WSDOT that does not contain all the requirements of a Plan Review Package, the CITY will notify WSDOT that the submittal is incomplete. To expedite the process and to the extent possible, the CITY will attempt to begin review of an incomplete submittal. However, WSDOT will submit the information needed to complete the Plan Review Package as soon as possible and will highlight any changes made since submittal of the incomplete Plan Review Package. The CITY's plan review period will not commence until the receipt of a complete Plan Review Package.

 3.7.4. The CITY's Designated Representative will work with the CITY departments to identify comments on the Plan Review Packages. The CITY departments will reconcile conflicting comments, and SDOT will incorporate the comments in a single document.

 3.7.5. The CITY will assist WSDOT in determining appropriate responses to comments and resolution of concerns noted in its comments.

 3.7.6. WSDOT will provide initial written responses to all comments within ten (10) Business Days of receiving the CITY's comments to a Plan Review Package. All comments related to CITY Infrastructure shall be resolved to the CITY's satisfaction and incorporated into the succeeding Plan Review Packages.

 3.7.7. WSDOT will hold a comment resolution meeting with the CITY within ten (10) Business Days after WSDOT receives and responds to the CITY comments. Any unresolved comments will be forwarded to a comment resolution team composed of CITY and WSDOT staff. In the event the team cannot resolve all issues, they will be elevated to appropriate levels of management in accordance with the dispute resolution provisions of GCA 6486, UT 01474, and UT 01476.

 3.8. WSDOT and the CITY agree to follow a process to facilitate both WSDOT's compliance with both WSDOT procedures governing preparation of bid packages and SDOT procedures for issuing Street Use Permits. The process will include the following steps:

 3.8.1. WSDOT will endeavor to resolve and address all CITY comments on previous Plan Review Packages to the CITY's satisfaction prior to submittal of the 100% Plan Review Package. The CITY will be responsive to requests to meet and review the design approach to resolution. WSDOT agrees to resolve and address, to the CITY's satisfaction, all CITY comments from previous Plan Review Packages that are related to CITY Infrastructure design.

 3.8.2. The CITY will determine, following the receipt of the 100% Plan Review Package, whether all comments on the previous Plan Review Package have been addressed. At the conclusion of this determination, the CITY will notify WSDOT in writing either that the CITY's comments have been resolved to the CITY's satisfaction or that WSDOT has not addressed all the CITY's comments to the CITY's satisfaction. If the CITY notifies WSDOT that it has not addressed all CITY comments to the CITY's satisfaction, the CITY will submit to WSDOT proposals for addressing the outstanding issues. WSDOT will engage CITY reviewers in resolution of the remaining review comments and, either party may elevate unresolved comments in accordance with the dispute resolution provisions of GCA 6486, UT 01474, and UT 01476.

 3.8.3. WSDOT will invite the CITY to participate in its Round Table Meeting to enable full discussion of the implications and consequences to CITY Facilities or compliance with SMC Title 15 of changes proposed by WSDOT to the 100% Plan Review Package. WSDOT will coordinate revisions made to the contract plans and provisions after WSDOT submits the 100% Plan Review Package.

 3.8.4. SDOT will issue its Street Use Permit within five (5) Business Days following the Round Table Meeting if the CITY determines that the plans conform to the requirements of SMC Title 15. If any issues remain for resolution, the CITY will condition the Street Use Permit accordingly. WSDOT will engage CITY reviewers in resolution of review comments and, if resolution cannot be reached, either PARTY may elevate unresolved comments in accordance with the dispute resolution provisions of GCA 6486, UT 01474, and UT 01476.

 3.8.5. If the Street Use Permit has not been issued within five (5) Business Days following the Round Table Meeting, the SDOT Director or his designee will review the cause of permit delay within one (1) Business Day, and meet with the STATE's Program Administrator or his designee to discuss the issues and develop a course of action.

 3.8.6. WSDOT will work with the CITY to ensure that all comments on the 100% Plan Review Package are adequately incorporated into WSDOT's advertisement for bid, or are otherwise addressed to WSDOT's and the CITY's satisfaction and that all comments on the 100% Plan Review Package related to design of CITY Infrastructure are addressed to the CITY's satisfaction. This process will include comment resolution with CITY reviewers, a meeting with WSDOT and CITY resolution teams, and, if resolution cannot be reached, elevation of unresolved comments in accordance with the dispute resolution provisions of GCA 6486, UT 01474, and UT 01476.

 3.8.6.1. WSDOT will prepare and submit post-advertisement addenda to the CITY prior to releasing addenda to prospective bidders. Addenda will clearly delineate changes that have been made to the plans and specifications. The addenda review periods will be determined by the scope and complexity of the proposed addenda with review times generally as indicated in the tables above.

 3.8.6.2. WSDOT will notify the CITY when the final addendum is issued to prospective bidders. This notice will constitute the Final Plan Review Package submittal. The CITY will review the Final Plan Review Package to confirm whether WSDOT has adequately addressed the CITY plan review comments, whether all applicable conditions of the Street Use Permit have been addressed to the CITY's satisfaction, and whether plans conform to the requirements of the SMC Title 15. Prior to bid opening, and upon the CITY's determination that a Final Plan Review Package meets requirements, the CITY will issue to WSDOT a Letter of Plan Approval that:

 * Identifies the plans and specifications that have been granted the CITY's regulatory approval for construction by the CITY, and

 * Signifies that WSDOT has addressed the plan review comments.

 No construction may take place until the Letter of Plan Approval has been issued by the CITY.

 4. Procedures for Design-Build Contracts

 4.1. The procedures that follow are intended to facilitate meeting requirements, standards, and objectives for the Design-Build portions of the PROJECT.

 4.2. WSDOT agrees to work with the CITY in defining and meeting the design and construction standards for the PROJECT work affecting CITY Facilities. The CITY will provide clear design guidance for elements of the PROJECT to be owned, operated or maintained by the CITY. WSDOT will include CITY design and construction standards in WSDOT's Design-Build Contract documents for CITY Facilities.

 4.3. WSDOT will apply for a Street Use Permit prior to issuance of the final Request for Proposals. The CITY may review and comment on the Final RFP.

 4.4. As a requirement of its Design-Build Contract(s), the Design-Builder will organize Task Forces for design development, coordination, and management of various elements of the work. The Task Forces are a primary vehicle for coordination and will provide an opportunity for WSDOT and CITY staff to provide input to the design process. Task Force meetings will also be the primary means to keep reviewers up to date on design development. Over-the-shoulder reviews will be conducted to facilitate quicker turn-around of formal plan reviews. Dependent on the need for coordination with adjacent contracts, some of the Task Forces will be designated as "corridor-wide." In addition to WSDOT and CITY staff, Task Force membership may include representatives from other stakeholders such as private utility owners, King County, the Port of Seattle, the stadiums, and adjacent contractors.

 4.5. The CITY will participate in Task Forces affecting CITY Facilities and for the performance of the CITY's regulatory responsibilities. Based on current PROJECT planning, the CITY will participate in the following Task Forces:

 * Utilities

 * Construction Monitoring

 * Fire and Life Safety

 * Maintenance of Traffic

 * Road/Traffic

 * Buildings

 * Public Information

 * Quality

 4.6. Task Forces will meet on a regular basis to solicit input, coordinate design and construction activity, and assure dissemination of critical PROJECT information to all members. The Design Builder or WSDOT will be the designated lead for meetings and recording of meeting minutes. The Task Forces will work collaboratively to review and provide guidance as the Design Builder develops Design Submittals.

 4.7. WSDOT and the CITY recognize that regular attendance at Task Force meetings by their respective staffs is necessary to discuss and agree upon resolutions of design issues before more formal review processes begin in order to streamline later review and minimize substantial comments when the Preliminary and Final Design plans are submitted.

 4.8. Attendance at over-the-shoulder review by CITY staff members will be determined by the CITY Construction Project Engineer based in part upon the materials to be reviewed. Whenever possible three (3) Business Days notice will be given to persons who do not regularly attend Task Force meetings. The CITY will make every effort to assign staff members to over-the-shoulder review meetings who are authorized to make final decisions regarding compliance of the plans for CITY Facilities with the CITY's standards, specifications and permit requirements.

 4.9. WSDOT's Design Builder will submit a Quality Management Plan (QMP) that will define the timing, content, and format of all design reviews. The QMP will also include processes and procedures for how regularly scheduled Task Force meetings will be used to support quality goals. These meetings, combined with over-the-shoulder reviews, will be an integral part of the process to discuss and resolve design issues outside of the formal review process and reduce the level of effort required to conduct the formal review process. The QMP will define how over-the-shoulder reviews will be conducted with Task Force members. Over-the-shoulder reviews are in- progress reviews of the design and provide opportunities for WSDOT, the CITY, and other stakeholders to provide comments and feedback on the design.

 4.10. The design builder will be required to provide three submittals for each design element as indicated below. These submittals are intended to meet the requirements of the design and Street Use Permit plan review processes of both WSDOT and the CITY. The CITY will review design elements affecting CITY Facilities and CITY interests, and for the performance of the CITY's regulatory responsibilities, within the scope stated in this Agreement, UT 01476 (SCL Agreement) and UT 01474 (SPU Agreement).

 4.10.1.  Preliminary Design Submittal . The intent of the Preliminary Design Submittal is to provide a formal opportunity for WSDOT, the CITY, the Design Builder, various design team disciplines, and other approved PROJECT stakeholders to review the construction documents in order to provide input addressing whether the plans reflect Design Builde Contract requirements for construction; whether design features are coordinated; and whether there are no fatal flaws within a given discipline or between disciplines. The contents of the Preliminary Design Submittal will vary by discipline as specified in the RFP or as mutually agreed by members of the applicable Task Force.

 4.10.2.  Final Design Submittal . The Final Design Submittal will be prepared when the design for a given element or area is near 100% complete. The Final Design Submittal includes plan sheets, specifications, technical memos, reports, calculations, and other pertinent data, as applicable and incorporates design changes or otherwise addresses CITY comments. As a result of the on-going discussion and resolution of design and construction issues through the regularly-scheduled Task Force meetings and over-the-shoulder reviews, it is anticipated that there will be very few revisions or changes at this stage. The Final Design Submittal will include all specifications, including but not limited to, all amendments to the WSDOT Standard Specifications for Road, Bridge and Municipal Construction, special provisions, technical requirements, and technical specifications, necessary to construct the work represented in the submittal. Following resolution of all comments, the Final Design Submittal may proceed through the written certification process described below in preparation for being released for construction.

 4.10.3.  Released for Construction (RFC) Submittal . At a minimum, the Design Builder will provide a preliminary and a final submittal of all plans and technical specifications and resolve all comments prior to being released for construction. Comments from the CITY concerning design of the CITY's stated requirements for CITY Infrastructure, and comments regarding compliance with SMC Title 15, will be resolved to the CITY's satisfaction. WSDOT will ensure that the RFC Submittal reflects all QA, QC, and design reviews required by the QMP and this Agreement, UT 01476 (SCL Agreement) and UT 01474 (SPU Agreement). . WSDOT will also provide a written certification from its contractor to be used to verify to WSDOT and the City that all QA procedures have been completed to ensure that all review comments have been incorporated as agreed to during the comment resolution process among WSDOT, and the Design- Builder, and that the documents are ready to be released for construction. Each sheet of the plan set and the cover of each set of technical specifications in the RFC Submittal will carry the Professional Engineer's stamp registered in the State of Washington and will be stamped "Released for Construction" by the contractor's Design QA Manager.

 4.10.4. WSDOT will provide hard copies and electronic files (in both CADD and PDF formats) of documents pertaining to CITY Facilities or the Street Use Permit as requested by the CITY's Construction Project Engineer. The electronic drawing files will include copies of all sheet and reference files used in the RFC Submittal. All design submittals will conform to the AWVSRP Computer Aided Design & Drafting Manual. Construction will not begin until WSDOT has determined that all required government and private approvals have been obtained.

 4.10.5.  Design Review . The review period for the Preliminary and Final Design Submittals will be fourteen (14) calendar days from the Business Day following receipt by the CITY's Construction Project Engineer of the Plan Review Package. The review period may be extended for submittals with overlapping review periods. The CITY will provide staff to provide guidance, review and comment on the Preliminary and Final Design Submittals for CITY Infrastructure, and work that impacts CITY Facilities and for work requiring a Street Use Permit as necessary to complete the reviews within the allotted period. Reviews may be required for the entire design or discrete portions of the design. Review comments will be submitted in a manner and form as requested and approved in the Design-Builder's QMP and mutually agreed by WSDOT and the CITY. WSDOT and the CITY Construction Project Engineer will jointly determine the design elements to be reviewed by the CITY.

 4.10.6.  Comment Resolution . The Design-Builder will schedule and maintain minutes of all resolution meetings with WSDOT and CITY staff and other Task Force members as appropriate to document and resolve review comments. It is intended that all comments will be resolved at these meetings. The Design-Builder will incorporate comment resolutions in subsequent submittals and provide a spreadsheet explaining action taken on each comment. In the event WSDOT disagrees with any CITY comment, the CITY and WSDOT will make staff with decision making authority on the issue available at the earliest possible opportunity to resolve the matter. If resolution cannot be reached, unresolved comments will be elevated in accordance with the dispute resolution provisions of GCA 6486, UT 01474, and UT 01476.

 4.10.7.  Street Use Permit Issuance . Upon receipt of a Preliminary Design Submittal, SDOT will make a determination as to whether the proposed work package requires a Street Use Permit under the provisions of SMC Title 15, or Letter of Plan Approval, and so notify WSDOT. SDOT will issue a Street Use Permit and Letter of Plan Approval for the initial RFC Submittal within three (3) days of receipt of the RFC Submittal if the CITY has determined that the plans for the PROJECT element conform to the requirements of SMC Title 15 and that WSDOT has resolved all CITY plan review comments. Upon receipt of the City-issued Street Use Permit and Letter of Plan Approval WSDOT will be authorized to proceed with construction subject to the terms and conditions of the permit.

 4.10.8. If the Street Use Permit has not been issued within three (3) Business Days after receipt of the RFC Submittal, the SDOT Director or his designee will review the cause of permit delay within one (1) Business Day, and meet with the STATE's Program Administrator or his designee to discuss the issues and develop a course of action.

 4.10.9.  Changes to RFC Submittal . WSDOT will diligently attempt to avoid the need for plan changes after issuance of a Street Use Permit or Letter of Plan Approval. In the event such changes occur, the CITY will undertake any additional review and permit re-issuance in as expedited a manner as practicable. WSDOT will require the Design-Builder's QMP to address the process for implementing design changes, including field changes, on the RFC Submittal. Design changes will be subject to the QA and QC measures and procedures, commensurate with those applied to the original design or that portion of the PROJECT under consideration for change. WSDOT will obtain CITY concurrence for all design changes affecting CITY Facilities or permitted interests prior to implementation of the change.

 4.10.10. WSDOT will require the Design Builder to document all revisions made to the Approved Plans and design documents during the construction phase of the PROJECT by preparing new, revised or supplemental documents (including plan sheets, technical specifications, calculations, reports, and narratives). The new, revised, and supplemental documents will meet all requirements for the original documents. Every revision will be assigned a number. The revision number will be assigned sequentially, with each change in a document or plan sheet identified by the revision number. The assigned number will be located both at the location of the change on the sheet and in the revision block of the document, along with an explanation of the change. Revised RFC Submittals will be reviewed by the CITY Project Construction Engineer, who will coordinate with CITY departments as required depending upon the nature of the changes and initiate amendment of the Street Use Permit if required, consistent with applicable law.

 5. Construction Management, Inspection, and Acceptance Procedures

 5.1.

The CITY will assign any change a high priority and provide a timely response commensurate with the complexity of the proposed change.

 5.12.3. The CITY may request additions and changes to the construction contract through WSDOT. WSDOT will comply with the requested changes provided that the changes are within the general scope of the PROJECT and comply with the PROJECT permits, State and/or Federal law and applicable rules, codes and/or regulations. WSDOT retains the right to reject requested changes if incorporating such changes could result in unwarranted additional cost to the STATE or a delay in the PROJECT schedule. Such additions and changes may lead to change orders, or they may lead to Betterments or New Work. If the CITY and WSDOT agree to implement the change, the requesting CITY department and WSDOT will document the request in writing by completing and signing a concurrence letter. The CITY agrees to reimburse WSDOT for the costs associated with Betterments and additional New Work.

 5.12.4. WSDOT will make available to the CITY all change order documentation that affects CITY Infrastructure.

 5.13.  Special Construction Considerations .

 5.13.1.  SCL . The following procedures apply specifically to SCL Facilities during construction.

 5.13.1.1.  Electrical Clearance Procedures . WSDOT contractors may need to obtain electrical clearances when it is necessary to de-energize electrical lines or system appurtenances. Individual clearance holders will be required to go through a training session based on SCL's System Operation Center (SOC) guidelines to familiarize themselves with SCL requirements for holding and maintaining a clearance on the SCL electrical system. SCL will provide WSDOT's contractor an outline of procedures and guidelines to follow at all times during the clearance and WSDOT will ensure that such guidelines and procedures are followed. Chief Dispatcher, Dana Wheelock or his designee at 206-706-0241, will be the contact for SCL. SCL's Power Line Clearance Coordinator reserves the right to review the contractor crew's qualifications and notify WSDOT. WSDOT will require the contractor to replace those sub-contractors who do not meet qualifications required under state law.

 5.13.1.2.  Advance Notice of Service Outages . WSDOT will submit a request in writing, thirty (30) calendar days prior to any necessary outages specifying the electrical boundaries, the date the outage will begin and the date the facilities can be re-energized and put into/back into service. SCL will accommodate such requests unless prohibited by operational necessity, a previously scheduled outage conflicts with the outage requested by WSDOT, or emergency conditions prohibit the outage or limit the availability of crews. If denied, SCL will assist WSDOT in finding another outage window. If granted, SCL will outline any conditions related to such outage to WSDOT.

 5.13.2.  SPU . The following special considerations apply to construction work associated with SPU Facilities.

 5.13.2.1.  Testing Specific to SPU Facilities .

These recommendations may be implemented by the State, City of Seattle, Port of Seattle, and/or King County as appropriate. Authority for tolling will require action by the State Legislature, while tolling rates are within the purview of the Transportation Commission.

 Staffing:  The Advisory Committee will be staffed by managers or policy level staff from WSDOT, SDOT, Port of Seattle, King County, and Council central staff. Staffing will be supported by technical staff from each of the agencies and/or consultant support. The role of staff will be to manage the Advisory Committee's work plan, develop a schedule, frame issues, and review and format technical data for the Advisory Committee's review. WSDOT and the City of Seattle will manage resources from the state's Alaskan Way Viaduct and Seawall Replacement Program budget to cover mutually agreeable staffing and consultant costs to support the Advisory Committee. State and City will jointly facilitate these meetings.

 Membership : The Advisory Committee will be comprised of up to 15 members. The Mayor; Seattle City Council; and WSDOT will each appoint one-third of the members. All members will be confirmed by Council. Advisory Committee membership should represent the following types of interests: Freight, retail, drivers, labor, bicycle and pedestrian interests, large employer, waterfront business, adjacent and affected neighborhoods, transit riders, low- income, and others.

 Timeline: The Advisory Committee will begin work in March 2011, and it will submit its initial tolling and diversion minimization recommendations by June 2012. Interim milestones will be established by the staff in conjunction with the Advisory Committee members.

 The Advisory Committee is expected to continue working to refine its analysis and recommendations through December 2015 (when the deep bored tunnel is scheduled to open to traffic and toll implementation begins). The Advisory Committee will continue its work for up to one year after tolling begins to review the effects of the implemented tolling and diversion minimization strategies and to make further recommendations.

 Scope of Work:

 The work of the Advisory Committee will take place through an iterative process of reviewing financial goals, assessing the impact of different tolling strategies on traffic using the SR 99 bored tunnel, and evaluating a range of strategies to minimize diversion. The tasks of the committee will include:

 1. Review anticipated traffic impacts on city streets and I-5 for different tolling scenarios.

 2. Explore ways to:

 a. Refine the tolling strategy for the SR 99 bored tunnel, including considering variable toll rate, and regional tolling and/or tolling of other state and city facilities.

 b. Reduce the level of toll revenue to the bored tunnel project by identifying alternative funding source(s).

 c. Optimize the tolling strategy for the SR 99 bored tunnel to balance accomplishing state funding goals while minimizing diversion of traffic.

 3. Assess various strategies for minimizing and mitigating adverse effects of traffic diversion from tolled SR99 onto city streets through optimizing traffic flows and/or restricting or limiting traffic, including, but not limited to:

 a. Setting priorities for street use by time of day for various users (cars, trucks, bicycles, pedestrians, transit, parking consistent with City's complete streets policy goals;

 SCL FACILITIES WORK AGREEMENT

 FOR SR99 BORED TUNNEL PROJECT

 EXHIBIT B

 Franchise/Utility Permit Conditions for Utility Facilities located within Limited Access Areas designated for the AWVSRP

 Introduction

 Below are the terms and conditions that will apply to Franchises / Utility Permits issued to SCL and SPU associated with areas designated new Limited Access Facility for the Proposed Bored Tunnel Project (Project).

 The exact location of the Limited Access limits is still not completely defined, and SPU and SCL will likely have pre-existing infrastructure that will fall within the Limited Access area. In addition, there are utilities that will be replaced or relocated that may be installed in areas of Limited Access, though there is a strong preference to limit these occurrences. The Franchise/Utility Permit conditions outlined below would not apply to the building of utility new facilities within the Limited Access areas.

 Utility Permit Conditions

 The Washington State Department of Transportation ("STATE") hereby grants to the \_\_\_\_\_\_ ("CITY") the non-exclusive permission to use a portion of the \_\_\_\_\_\_, situated in Seattle, Washington. The rights herein granted are subject to all other easements and permits affecting the lands subject to this Permit.

 1. Background .  The Proposed Bored Tunnel Project (Project) replaces State Route 99 from South Royal Brougham Way to Roy Street and consists of designing and constructing a four-lane bored tunnel from South King Street to Thomas Street; north and south tunnel portals and access streets; re-establishment of the CITY street grid in the vicinity of the portals; and associated utility relocations. The Project is located in Seattle, which is a very densely developed urban environment, with utility infrastructure that has been woven into the fabric of the CITY. There is no alternative but to have the portals associated with the Project emerge into CITY street right of way where CITY owned Utility Facilities currently reside. The cost of purchasing right of way outside of these CITY streets is prohibitive, and the STATE has no choice but to declare portions of the CITY right of way as a Limited Access Facility as part of this Project. This Permit addresses the situation where CITY owned Utility Facilities will have to be modified, incorporated, or replaced in newly-designated Limited Access Facility, which was once CITY street right of way that formed part of STATE Route 99 as provided in RCW 47.24.010 and RCW 47.24.020. The STATE has endeavored to limit the scope of instances where CITY-owned Utility Facilities are relocated into Limited Access Facility or where the Limited Access Facility incorporates existing CITY-owned Utility Facilities.

 2.  Purpose . The purpose of the Permit is to provide for the location, operation, maintenance, replacement, modification, and repair of all existing CITY Utility Facilities, including, but not limited to, wires, pipelines, fibers, cables, communications devices and associated facilities and equipment both at or below- grade owned by the CITY. The location of the Utility Facilities is within portions of the areas legally described in Exhibit A, and depicted on Exhibit B, each of which is attached and incorporated by reference.

 3.  Reservation . This Permit shall not be deemed or held to be an exclusive one and shall not prohibit the STATE from granting rights of like or other nature to other public or private utilities, nor shall it prevent the STATE from using any of its roads, streets, or public places, or affect its right to full supervision and control over all or any part of them, none of which is hereby surrendered.

 4.  Term . The Permit shall have a duration of fifty (50) years, and shall be renewed upon request in writing to the STATE and shall contain the same terms and conditions as this permit, unless otherwise requested by the City and approved by the STATE. The Permit, and shall be transferable to any third party fulfilling the function of CITY, and the third party shall have all of the same rights, obligations, and benefits herein provided to CITY.

 5.  Permitted Users . The STATE acknowledges that CITY may choose to allow its agents, contractors, employees, lessees, successors and assigns use of the lands subject to this Permit for the intended purpose. The rights, title, privileges and authority hereby granted in this Permit shall continue and be in force until such time as the CITY, its successors and assigns, shall permanently remove all Utility Facilities from the area or permanently abandon the Utility Facilities.

 6.  Relocation of Utility Facilities . Due to the fact that there are no reasonable alternative locations within which to relocate the CITY-owned utility facilities, and further due to the STATE's obligations to mitigate damages and limit Project costs, there may be a need to relocate the CITY-owned Utility Facilities within the STATE's Limited Access Facility. Whenever necessary for the construction, repair, improvement, alteration, or relocation of any portion of Project in Limited Access as determined by the STATE, or if the STATE shall determine that the removal of any or all Utility Facilities from the said lands is necessary, incidental, or convenient to the construction, repair, improvement, alteration, or relocation of the public road or street located in the STATE's Limited Access Facility, the CITY shall, upon written notice by the STATE, relocate or remove any or all of such Utility Facilities from the Limited Access Facility as may be required by the STATE. The STATE agrees to pay the full reasonable costs of such relocations and agrees to give the CITY 3 years advance notice of the needed relocations in order for the CITY to adequately plan, design and construct the relocations. In the event CITY fails to remove or relocate the Utility Facilities within a reasonable time, the STATE may undertake such removal or relocation, at the sole expense of the STATE and with all necessary coordination with the CITY.

 7.  Maintenance, Replacement, Repair, and Modification . All maintenance, replacement, repair, and modification of the Utility Facilities by CITY, for that area depicted on Exhibit B, shall be done in such manner as will cause the least interference with any of the STATE's performance in the operation and maintenance of XXX. All costs for such work shall be at the sole expense of the CITY, unless the need for such work is caused by the STATE. Any replacement or modification of existing Utility Facilities, within the area depicted on Exhibit B, that require the placement of above-ground facilities, shall require the issuance of an additional Utility Permit by the STATE for such construction of above-ground facilities,, which permit shall not be unreasonably withheld, and shall conform with the Control Zone guidelines referenced in WAC 468-34-170 and WAC 468-34-350.

 8.  Restoration of Highway . Except as set forth in paragraph 6 above, the CITY agrees, at its own expense, to restore paving, grading, landscaping and other improvements damaged by CITY's activities under this Permit to at least as good a condition as such paving, grading, landscaping and other improvements were in immediately prior to the CITY's commencement of work. All material and workmanship shall conform to the Washington State Department of Transportation Standard Specification for Road, Bridge and Municipal Construction, as it may exist at that time, and may be subject to inspection by the STATE. Upon failure, neglect, or refusal of the CITY to timely restore the highway as required of the CITY, the STATE may undertake and perform such restoration, at the sole cost and expense of the CITY.

 9.  Emergency Access to CITY-Owned Utility Facilities . In the event of an emergency, the CITY will have 24 hour access to CITY-owned Utility Facilities located in STATE Limited Access. In an emergency, the STATE shall cooperate with the requests of the CITY, to facilitate CITY's response to the situation in order to protect the public health, safety and welfare. In situations of non-emergency, the CITY will have access to CITY-owned Utility Facilities as outlined in paragraph 10.

 10.  Construction and Maintenance of Utility Facilities in Non-Emergency Situations .

 A. The CITY has the right to install, construct, alter, repair, operate, improve and maintain all CITY-owned Utility Facilities, including appurtenances associated with this Permit. The CITY has the right to replace any of the permitted Utility Facilities with facilities of the similar size or configuration, in the same location as the originally-permitted Utility Facilities without requesting a change to this Permit.

 B. The CITY shall provide the STATE fifteen (15) business days written notice prior to commencement of maintenance activities under this Permit, and at least forty-five (45) business days written notice prior to commencement of construction activities under this Permit. In both cases, the CITY shall submit to the STATE work plans depicting the work to be performed by the CITY and shall coordinate with the STATE (WSDOT NW Region Maintenance Engineer) during these time periods. The STATE will make all reasonable effort to provide a letter of authorization to the CITY within fifteen (15) business days for maintenance activities and sixty (60) business days for construction activities.

 C. Prior to the beginning of construction, a preconstruction conference shall be held, at which time the STATE, the CITY, and appropriate engineers and inspectors shall be present.

 D. A copy of this Permit must be posted on the job site, and protected from the elements, at all times during any construction authorized by this Permit.

 E. In the event any milepost, right of way marker, fence or guard rail is located within the limits of CITY's construction and will be disturbed during construction, these items will be carefully removed prior to construction and reset or replaced at the conclusion of construction to the satisfaction of the STATE. All signs and traffic control devices must be maintained in operation during construction.

 F. Prior to construction, the CITY shall contact the STATE representative to ascertain the location of survey control monuments within the project limits. In the event any monuments will be altered, damaged or destroyed by the project, appropriate action will be taken by the STATE, prior to construction, to reference or reset the monuments. Any monuments altered, damaged or destroyed by the CITY's operation will be reset or replaced by the STATE at the sole expense of the CITY.

 G. During the construction and/or maintenance of the utilities, the CITY shall comply with the "Manual on Uniform Traffic Control Devices for Streets and Highways" as it may exist at that time, as well as any applicable Washington statues or regulation. Any closure or restriction of the Limited Access Facility requested by the CITY pursuant to this Permit shall require the CITY to submit a traffic control plan for the STATE's timely approval. The timely approval will be commensurate with the scope of the work proposed. Except in case of emergency, no work pursuant to this Permit can be performed on the XXX until the STATE has approved the traffic control plan.

 H. Should the CITY choose to perform the work outlined herein with other than its own forces, a representative of the CITY shall be present at all times unless otherwise agreed to by the STATE representative. All contact between the STATE and the CITY's contractor shall be through the representative of the CITY. Where the CITY chooses to perform the work with its own forces, it may elect to appoint one of its own employees engaged in the construction as its representative. Failure to comply with this provision shall be grounds for restricting any further work by the CITY within the STATE right of way until said requirement is met. The CITY, at its own expense, shall adequately police and supervise all construction work by itself, its contractor, subcontractor, agent, and others, so as not to endanger or injure any person or property.

 I. Except in an emergency or unless authorized by the STATE, work shall be restricted to between the hours of 9:00 a.m. and 3:30 p.m. and the hours of 7:00 p.m. and 5:00 a.m., and no work shall be allowed on the right of way on holidays.

 J. All trenches, boring or jacking pits, etc., shall be backfilled as soon as possible and not left open during non-working hours unless covered with material of sufficient strength to withstand traffic loads, or protected by an alternate method approved by the STATE.

 K. All slopes, slope treatment, top soil, ditches, pipes, etc., disturbed by this operation shall be restored to their original cross section and condition. All open trenches shall be marked by warning signs, barricades, lights, and if necessary, flagmen shall be employed for the purpose of protecting the traveling public.

 L. The responsibility of the CITY for proper performance, safe conduct, and adequate policing and supervision of the work shall not be lessened or otherwise affected by STATE approval of plans, specifications, or work or by the presence at the work site of STATE representatives, or by compliance by the CITY with any requests for recommendations made by such representatives.

 11.  STATE's Construction and Maintenance of XXX.  The STATE shall inform the CITY in writing no less than forty-five (45) days in advance of planned work to coordinate with the CITY regarding the planned STATE work. Such writing shall include submittal of the STATE's work plans.

 A. In the event that construction and maintenance of XXX within the proximity of the CITY-owned Utility Facilities becomes necessary, it is expressly understood that, upon request from the STATE's representative, the CITY will promptly identify and locate by suitable field markings any and all of their underground Utility Facilities in accordance with RCW 19.122.030.

 B. The CITY shall provide comments and requests in writing to the STATE regarding the STATE's planned work within fifteen (15) business days of submittal of the STATE's work plans for maintenance activities, and within forty five (45) business days for construction activities. The STATE shall endeavor to resolve and incorporate CITY comments, and will coordinate with the CITY regarding their comments and concerns.

 C. The CITY may have an on-site inspector, as it deems necessary, during any excavation or construction work within the permitted area. The inspector shall have complete access to area work and be timely informed of all relevant construction timelines associated with such work.

 D. CITY Construction Guidelines will be followed when considering the placement of other utility facilities in the vicinity of CITY-owned Utility Facilities. No other utility facilities, whether public or private, will be installed within five (5) horizontal feet or eighteen (18) vertical inches of the utility facilities without informing and coordinating with the CITY. Where possible, sewer and storm drains shall be laid at a lower invert elevation than water mains.

 E. No permanent structure will be erected or permitted within the area without coordination with the CITY.

 F. No construction of buildings, fences, walls, or placement of trees, shrubbery, obstruction, or fill material will be placed within the boundaries of area covered by this permit without prior notification and coordination with the CITY.

 G. No blasting or discharge of any explosives will be undertaken within 50 ft of CITY-owned Utility Facilities without prior notification and coordination with the CITY.

 12.  Hold Harmless/Indemnification . The CITY, its successors and assigns agree to indemnify, defend and hold the STATE, its officers and employees harmless from all claims, demands, damages, expenses or suits that: (1) arise out of or are incident to any negligence by the CITY, its agents, contractors or employees in the use of the highway right of way pursuant to this Permit, or (2) are caused by the breach of any of the conditions of the Permit by the CITY, its contractors, agents or employees. Nothing herein shall require the CITY to indemnify and hold harmless the STATE and its officers and employees from claims, demands, damages, expenses or suits based solely upon the conduct or negligence of the STATE, its agents, officers, employees and contractors; and provided further that if the claims or suits are caused by or result from the concurrent negligence of (a) the STATE, its agents, or employees, and (b) the CITY, its agents or employees, including those actions covered by RCW4.24.115, the foregoing obligations shall be valid and enforceable only to the extent of CITY's negligence.

SPU may perform mitigation measures on behalf of the STATE in a manner and schedule that supports the STATE's PROJECT requirements. SPU's input, advice, participation, and access shall be provided to assist the STATE only, and shall not be interpreted as waiving or limiting in any way the STATE's responsibility for Deformation Mitigation or other damages.

 4.6 The STATE is responsible for repairing, replacing or otherwise remedying loss of function or capacity of SPU Facilities as a consequence of Deformation or exceedance of watermain total displacement criteria as set forth in Section 4.8 of this Agreement, except that the STATE's responsibility to repair, replace or otherwise remedy the loss of function or capacity of SPU watermains shall end two (2) years after substantial completion of Design-Build Contract or earlier if the PARTIES agree that monitoring indicates that the rate of Deformation is not significant and further monitoring is unwarranted.

 4.7 The STATE's monitoring program shall measure and documents Deformation that occurs between initiation of construction and completion of the monitoring period. As part of the monitoring program, the STATE agrees to conduct pre-construction video inspection surveys of gravity systems and leak surveys of water mains. Additionally, along with soil monitoring points, the STATE shall include pre-construction survey of accessible portions of the watermains and services, such as valves stems and meters. These points shall be monitored in the event that adjacent monitoring points approach the total displacement criteria for water mains or differential Deformation indicates a risk to services. For locations where direct monitoring of watermains and services is not provided, the STATE shall use spatial interpolation methodologies, to be agreed upon by the PARTIES, to estimate settlement at any point within the Deformation zone of influence using all available and pertinent monitoring points. In the absence of direct monitoring points, the PARTIES agree that the displacement values determined by spatial interpolation shall be considered an acceptable estimate of watermain displacement attributable to the PROJECT for the purpose of determining that an exceedance has or has not occurred.

 4.8 The STATE agrees to perform Deformation Mitigation Work on watermains that are subject to displacement in excess of the criteria established in the tables below.

 SPU FACILITIES WORK AGREEMENT

 FOR SR99 BORED TUNNEL PROJECT

 EXHIBIT B

 Franchise/Utility Permit Conditions for Utility Facilities located within Limited Access Areas designated for the AWVSRP

 Introduction

 Below are the terms and conditions that will apply to Franchises / Utility Permits issued to SCL and SPU associated with areas designated new Limited Access Facility for the Proposed Bored Tunnel Project (Project).

 The exact location of the Limited Access limits is still not completely defined, and SPU and SCL will likely have pre-existing infrastructure that will fall within the Limited Access area. In addition, there are utilities that will be replaced or relocated that may be installed in areas of Limited Access, though there is a strong preference to limit these occurrences. The Franchise/Utility Permit conditions outlined below would not apply to the building of utility new facilities within the Limited Access areas.

 Utility Permit Conditions

 The Washington State Department of Transportation ("STATE") hereby grants to the \_\_\_\_\_\_ ("CITY") the non-exclusive permission to use a portion of the \_\_\_\_\_\_, situated in Seattle, Washington. The rights herein granted are subject to all other easements and permits affecting the lands subject to this Permit.

 1. Background .  The Proposed Bored Tunnel Project (Project) replaces State Route 99 from South Royal Brougham Way to Roy Street and consists of designing and constructing a four-lane bored tunnel from South King Street to Thomas Street; north and south tunnel portals and access streets; re-establishment of the CITY street grid in the vicinity of the portals; and associated utility relocations. The Project is located in Seattle, which is a very densely developed urban environment, with utility infrastructure that has been woven into the fabric of the CITY. There is no alternative but to have the portals associated with the Project emerge into CITY street right of way where CITY owned Utility Facilities currently reside. The cost of purchasing right of way outside of these CITY streets is prohibitive, and the STATE has no choice but to declare portions of the CITY right of way as a Limited Access Facility as part of this Project. This Permit addresses the situation where CITY owned Utility Facilities will have to be modified, incorporated, or replaced in newly-designated Limited Access Facility, which was once CITY street right of way that formed part of STATE Route 99 as provided in RCW 47.24.010 and RCW 47.24.020. The STATE has endeavored to limit the scope of instances where CITY-owned Utility Facilities are relocated into Limited Access Facility or where the Limited Access Facility incorporates existing CITY-owned Utility Facilities.

 2.  Purpose . The purpose of the Permit is to provide for the location, operation, maintenance, replacement, modification, and repair of all existing CITY Utility Facilities, including, but not limited to, wires, pipelines, fibers, cables, communications devices and associated facilities and equipment both at or below- grade owned by the CITY. The location of the Utility Facilities is within portions of the areas legally described in Exhibit A, and depicted on Exhibit B, each of which is attached and incorporated by reference.

 3.  Reservation . This Permit shall not be deemed or held to be an exclusive one and shall not prohibit the STATE from granting rights of like or other nature to other public or private utilities, nor shall it prevent the STATE from using any of its roads, streets, or public places, or affect its right to full supervision and control over all or any part of them, none of which is hereby surrendered.

 4.  Term . The Permit shall have a duration of fifty (50) years, and shall be renewed upon request in writing to the STATE and shall contain the same terms and conditions as this permit, unless otherwise requested by the City and approved by the STATE. The Permit, and shall be transferable to any third party fulfilling the function of CITY, and the third party shall have all of the same rights, obligations, and benefits herein provided to CITY.

 5.  Permitted Users . The STATE acknowledges that CITY may choose to allow its agents, contractors, employees, lessees, successors and assigns use of the lands subject to this Permit for the intended purpose. The rights, title, privileges and authority hereby granted in this Permit shall continue and be in force until such time as the CITY, its successors and assigns, shall permanently remove all Utility Facilities from the area or permanently abandon the Utility Facilities.

 6.  Relocation of Utility Facilities . Due to the fact that there are no reasonable alternative locations within which to relocate the CITY-owned utility facilities, and further due to the STATE's obligations to mitigate damages and limit Project costs, there may be a need to relocate the CITY-owned Utility Facilities within the STATE's Limited Access Facility. Whenever necessary for the construction, repair, improvement, alteration, or relocation of any portion of Project in Limited Access as determined by the STATE, or if the STATE shall determine that the removal of any or all Utility Facilities from the said lands is necessary, incidental, or convenient to the construction, repair, improvement, alteration, or relocation of the public road or street located in the STATE's Limited Access Facility, the CITY shall, upon written notice by the STATE, relocate or remove any or all of such Utility Facilities from the Limited Access Facility as may be required by the STATE. The STATE agrees to pay the full reasonable costs of such relocations and agrees to give the CITY 3 years advance notice of the needed relocations in order for the CITY to adequately plan, design and construct the relocations. In the event CITY fails to remove or relocate the Utility Facilities within a reasonable time, the STATE may undertake such removal or relocation, at the sole expense of the STATE and with all necessary coordination with the CITY.

 7.  Maintenance, Replacement, Repair, and Modification . All maintenance, replacement, repair, and modification of the Utility Facilities by CITY, for that area depicted on Exhibit B, shall be done in such manner as will cause the least interference with any of the STATE's performance in the operation and maintenance of XXX. All costs for such work shall be at the sole expense of the CITY, unless the need for such work is caused by the STATE. Any replacement or modification of existing Utility Facilities, within the area depicted on Exhibit B, that require the placement of above-ground facilities, shall require the issuance of an additional Utility Permit by the STATE for such construction of above-ground facilities,, which permit shall not be unreasonably withheld, and shall conform with the Control Zone guidelines referenced in WAC 468-34-170 and WAC 468-34-350.

 8.  Restoration of Highway . Except as set forth in paragraph 6 above, the CITY agrees, at its own expense, to restore paving, grading, landscaping and other improvements damaged by CITY's activities under this Permit to at least as good a condition as such paving, grading, landscaping and other improvements were in immediately prior to the CITY's commencement of work. All material and workmanship shall conform to the Washington State Department of Transportation Standard Specification for Road, Bridge and Municipal Construction, as it may exist at that time, and may be subject to inspection by the STATE. Upon failure, neglect, or refusal of the CITY to timely restore the highway as required of the CITY, the STATE may undertake and perform such restoration, at the sole cost and expense of the CITY.

 9.  Emergency Access to CITY-Owned Utility Facilities . In the event of an emergency, the CITY will have 24 hour access to CITY-owned Utility Facilities located in STATE Limited Access. In an emergency, the STATE shall cooperate with the requests of the CITY, to facilitate CITY's response to the situation in order to protect the public health, safety and welfare. In situations of non-emergency, the CITY will have access to CITY-owned Utility Facilities as outlined in paragraph 10.

 10.  Construction and Maintenance of Utility Facilities in Non-Emergency Situations .

 A. The CITY has the right to install, construct, alter, repair, operate, improve and maintain all CITY-owned Utility Facilities, including appurtenances associated with this Permit. The CITY has the right to replace any of the permitted Utility Facilities with facilities of the similar size or configuration, in the same location as the originally-permitted Utility Facilities without requesting a change to this Permit.

 B. The CITY shall provide the STATE fifteen (15) business days written notice prior to commencement of maintenance activities under this Permit, and at least forty-five (45) business days written notice prior to commencement of construction activities under this Permit. In both cases, the CITY shall submit to the STATE work plans depicting the work to be performed by the CITY and shall coordinate with the STATE (WSDOT NW Region Maintenance Engineer) during these time periods. The STATE will make all reasonable effort to provide a letter of authorization to the CITY within fifteen (15) business days for maintenance activities and sixty (60) business days for construction activities.

 C. Prior to the beginning of construction, a preconstruction conference shall be held, at which time the STATE, the CITY, and appropriate engineers and inspectors shall be present.

 D. A copy of this Permit must be posted on the job site, and protected from the elements, at all times during any construction authorized by this Permit.

 E. In the event any milepost, right of way marker, fence or guard rail is located within the limits of CITY's construction and will be disturbed during construction, these items will be carefully removed prior to construction and reset or replaced at the conclusion of construction to the satisfaction of the STATE. All signs and traffic control devices must be maintained in operation during construction.

 F. Prior to construction, the CITY shall contact the STATE representative to ascertain the location of survey control monuments within the project limits. In the event any monuments will be altered, damaged or destroyed by the project, appropriate action will be taken by the STATE, prior to construction, to reference or reset the monuments. Any monuments altered, damaged or destroyed by the CITY's operation will be reset or replaced by the STATE at the sole expense of the CITY.

 G. During the construction and/or maintenance of the utilities, the CITY shall comply with the "Manual on Uniform Traffic Control Devices for Streets and Highways" as it may exist at that time, as well as any applicable Washington statues or regulation. Any closure or restriction of the Limited Access Facility requested by the CITY pursuant to this Permit shall require the CITY to submit a traffic control plan for the STATE's timely approval. The timely approval will be commensurate with the scope of the work proposed. Except in case of emergency, no work pursuant to this Permit can be performed on the XXX until the STATE has approved the traffic control plan.

 H. Should the CITY choose to perform the work outlined herein with other than its own forces, a representative of the CITY shall be present at all times unless otherwise agreed to by the STATE representative. All contact between the STATE and the CITY's contractor shall be through the representative of the CITY. Where the CITY chooses to perform the work with its own forces, it may elect to appoint one of its own employees engaged in the construction as its representative.
