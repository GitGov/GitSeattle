</table> C. The fees for the following special hazards permits are established in Schedule C. See Table 22.602.045C.  Special Hazards Permits

 Fees for special hazards permits are established in Schedule C (See Table 22.602.045 C). In some cases these fees are based on the quantity of hazardous material stored and/or handled at the site and the relative risk posed by each material.

 1. Definitions:

 a. "Quantity Range Number" as established in the Quantity Range Table below, is a number

 between 1 and 2 that is assigned to a hazard category based upon the amount of hazardous material located at the site.

</table> c. "Fixed permit cost" is the minimum cost for the Seattle Fire Department to issue a  hazardous material permit. The fixed permit cost is (( ~~One hundred eighty-one Dollars ($181.00)~~)) $208 .

 d. "Base permit fee" is determined by multiplying the sum of the products of the quantity range

 number and assigned risk factor for each hazard class by the fixed permit cost (( ~~divided by 1.1~~)) and is represented by the following equation:

 Base permit fee = [S (Q1)(R1) + (Q2)(R2) . . ..] [F(( ~~/1.1~~))]

 Where: Q = The quantity range number.

 R = The assigned risk factor.

 F = The fixed permit cost (( ~~$181.00~~)) $208

 When an individual material has multiple hazards, only the hazard presented by the hazard class that has been assigned the highest risk factor shall be considered in the fee calculation.

 Example:

 XYZ Company stores (( ~~fifty (~~))50(( ~~)~~)) gallons of gasoline and (( ~~two hundred (~~))200(( ~~)~~)) gallons of 50% nitric acid. Gasoline is classified as a Class I flammable liquid which has an assigned risk factor of 1.4. Nitric acid (50%) is classified as both a corrosive liquid and a Class 2 oxidizer. Because 50% nitric acid presents two separate hazards (corrosive and Class 2 oxidizer) only the Class 2 oxidizer hazard is considered in the fee calculation because it has an assigned risk factor of 1.2 compared to the 1.1 risk factor assigned to corrosives.

 Base permit fee = [(1)(1.4)flammable + (1.25)(1.2)Class 2 oxidizer] [(( ~~$181.00~~)) $208 (( ~~/1.1~~))]

 Base permit fee = (( ~~$477.20~~)) $603.20

This permit cannot be renewed but additional 1070 permits can be issued as needed to cover the entire compliance plan period.
