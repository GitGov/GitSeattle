 WHEREAS, the City of Seattle adopted the 2009 -- 2012 Consolidated Plan for Housing and Community Development ("Plan") via Resolution 31087 and re-adopted it, as amended, by Ordinance 123057, and HUD approved the Plan, and the Plan has been amended, most recently by Council Bill 117254; and

 BE IT ORDAINED BY THE CITY OF SEATTLE AS FOLLOWS:

 Section 1. The Seattle City Council hereby adopts the 2012 Update to the 2009 -- 2012 Consolidated Plan for Housing and Community Development ("Plan"), attached hereto as Attachment 1 ("2012 Update"), for the purposes and subject to the conditions, limitations and potential amendments as set forth in this ordinance. The Residential Antidisplacement and Relocation Assistance Plan ("RARAP") included in the 2012 Update, with any modifications made by the Director of Human Services pursuant to Section 4 of this ordinance, shall replace in its entirety the former RARAP adopted by Ordinance 119163, a copy of which is attached to this ordinance as Attachment 2, provided that such former RARAP shall continue to apply, except as may be otherwise required by federal laws or regulations, with respect to projects for which funds are committed prior to January 1, 2012.

 Section 2. The 2012 Annual Allocation Plan, included in the 2012 Update, represents the City's plan and proposal to the United States Department of Housing and Urban Development ("HUD") for the use of the funds shown in the 2012 Annual Allocation Plan. The Plan as amended by the 2012 Update, including such Annual Allocation Plan and the descriptions of strategies, housing policies, residential anti-displacement and relocation policies, and allocation policies, is intended to serve the functions set forth in 24 CFR Section 91.1(b), but the contents of the Plan, as amended by the 2012 Update, are not otherwise intended to have legal effect except as otherwise specifically stated in the 2012 Update or in the Plan.

 Section 3. The allocations set forth in the 2012 Update do not constitute appropriations or modify the amounts of any existing appropriations, nor are they to be considered as final funding decisions. The authority of the respective City departments and offices to implement the activities set forth in the 2012 Update is subject to sufficient appropriations in the City of Seattle 2012 Adopted Budget or in any separate ordinance. Implementation of any specific project or program is also subject to a final determination by the appropriate office or department after completion of any necessary review under environmental and related laws. No part of the 2012 Update or the Plan is intended to confer any legal rights or entitlements on any persons, groups or entities.

 Section 4. The Mayor and the Director of Human Services ("the Director") and their designees are hereby authorized to submit the 2012 Update to the 2009 -- 2012 Consolidated Plan for Housing and Community Development, together with any necessary supplementary material, to HUD as the application by the City for financial assistance under certain HUD programs; to represent the City in seeking HUD approval of the 2012 Update, to make and submit to HUD such modifications to the 2012 Update or the Plan as HUD may require, provided that no substantial policy changes are involved; to add a summary of public comments and responses to those comments to the Update; and to sign and deliver on behalf of the City such assurances and certifications as may be necessary to obtain HUD approval. The Director is further authorized to make such technical and conforming changes to the Update or the Plan as the Director may deem reasonably necessary, and to amend the Plan, if necessary or appropriate under federal regulations, to reflect funding of specific activities, final appropriations for the programs or budget control levels in the Adopted Budget, or changes in activities that are consistent with the policies and priorities established in the Plan. The Director shall notify the Council of all changes or amendments to the Plan. Any substantial amendment, as defined by the adopted Citizen Participation Plan in the 2009 - 2012 Consolidated Plan, as amended, shall require approval by the Council by ordinance.

 Section 5. Awards by the Director of Housing of 2011 CDBG and HOME funds for rental housing activities made prior to the effective date of this ordinance are hereby ratified and confirmed, provided that the awards are consistent with the Affordability Policies for Federal HOME and CDBG Funds in the Housing Policies section of Consolidated Plan as amended by the 2012 Update, as applied to the total of all CDBG and HOME rental housing funds allocated in the 2011 Update to the Consolidated Plan, as amended, and in the 2012 Update, and provided that the awards are otherwise consistent with the Consolidated Plan as in effect at the time of such awards.

 Section 6. This ordinance shall take effect and be in force 30 days after its approval by the Mayor, but if not approved and returned by the Mayor within ten days after presentation, it shall take effect as provided by Seattle Municipal Code Section 1.04.020.
