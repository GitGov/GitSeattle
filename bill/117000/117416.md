 AN ORDINANCE relating to Unfair Public Accommodation Practices; amending sections 14.06.020 and 14.06.030 to add the right of a mother to breastfeed her child in places of public accommodation free from discrimination.

 WHEREAS, breastfeeding discrimination is a race and social justice issue with people of color in Seattle experiencing lower breastfeeding rates and higher rates of preterm birth, infant mortality, maternal mortality, diabetes and obesity than white residents.

 WHEREAS, infant mortality and low birth weight disproportionally impact Native American and African American women in King County, and addressing this disproportionality has been a Seattle Women's Commission priority since 2006.

 WHEREAS, eliminating societal barriers to breastfeeding will enable more women to successfully continue to breastfeed their children for longer. While 75% of U.S. babies start out breastfeeding, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, only 13% are exclusively breastfed for the recommended six months.

 WHEREAS, anything less than exclusive breastfeeding for the first 6 months of life increases health risks for babies, particularly to the immune and digestive systems and yet this marker is difficult to attain when women are not supported or face discrimination for breastfeeding their children in places of public accommodation.

 WHEREAS, in 2009, House Bill 1596 passed the Washington State Legislature unanimously and was signed into law by Governor Gregoire. The law amended the Washington Law Against Discrimination (WLAD) to include civil rights protections for mothers to breastfeed their child in any place of public accommodation; NOW, THEREFORE,

 BE IT ORDAINED BY THE CITY OF SEATTLE AS FOLLOWS:

 Section 1. Sections 14.06.020 and 14.06.030 of the Seattle Municipal Code, last amended by Ordinance 123527 and Ordinance 123014 respectively, are each amended to read as follows:
