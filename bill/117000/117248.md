 5. Grantee agrees to assume all risk of loss, damage or injury, which may result from Grantee's use of the City's property. It is understood that any damage to the City's property or transmission line facilities or appurtenances caused by or resulting from Grantee's use of the City's property may be repaired by the City and the actual cost of such repair shall be charged against and be paid by Grantee.
