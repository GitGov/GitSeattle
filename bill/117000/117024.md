 ORDINANCE _________________

 AN ORDINANCE relating to the Seattle Department of Transportation; amending Section 11.16.319 of the Seattle Municipal Code revising permit fees related to restricted parking zones.

 WHEREAS, SMC 11.16.120, SMC 11.16.315, and SMC 11.16.317 authorize the Director of Transportation to establish parking rates and fees for restricted (otherwise known as "residential") parking zones, and make recommendations to the City Council for fees for permits; and

 WHEREAS, in 1979, Ordinance 108354 established the Restricted Parking Zone program to help ease parking congestion in residential neighborhoods; and

 WHEREAS, RPZs are located in neighborhoods close to generators of high traffic demand, such as universities, high schools, hospitals, transit stations or stops, and business districts; and

 WHEREAS, the establishment of RPZs in such neighborhoods limits the impact of employees, transit commuters, and students parking their vehicles for lengthy periods of time who use parking that might otherwise be utilized by residents and area visitors; and

 WHEREAS, the program has grown from 21 restricted parking zones and 10,000 permits issued annually in 2003 to 33 zones and an estimated 22,000 permits issued annually in 2010; and

 WHEREAS, in 2009 and 2010 the Seattle Department of Transportation made significant customer service and system improvements to the RPZ program, including the introduction of online permitting; and

 WHEREAS, it is necessary to adjust the fees to cover the increased costs for improvements to and administration of the RPZ permitting systems; and
