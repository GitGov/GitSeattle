 AN ORDINANCE relating to the North Downtown electrical substation, distribution network, and associated transmission improvements in the South Lake Union Urban Center; removing two budget provisos that limit spending of appropriations in the 2009 Adopted Budget; adding a new project and revising project allocations for certain projects in the 2012-2017 Adopted CIP; and ratifying and confirming certain prior acts.

 WHEREAS, South Lake Union is identified in the City of Seattle's Comprehensive Plan as a designated Urban Center for increased employment and residential growth; and

 WHEREAS, the City Council adopted Resolution 30610, affirming the City of Seattle's commitment to the South Lake Union area as the region's most competitive location for biotech and high-tech research and industry; and

 WHEREAS, the biotech and high-tech companies and institutions located in the South Lake Union area are extremely sensitive to outages and disruption of electrical service; and

 WHEREAS, the increased growth and development density in the South Lake Union area has reduced the amount of physical space available in the right-of-way for electrical infrastructure; and

 WHEREAS, the City Light Department recommends development of a network distribution system for the South Lake Union area as the most viable and safe alternative for meeting the high reliability needs of biotech and high-tech customers, and for providing electrical service in a dense, urban environment; and

 WHEREAS, the existing substations in the downtown Seattle area do not have sufficient 13 kV capacity to serve a new network distribution system for the South Lake Union area; and

 WHEREAS, a new North Downtown area substation will provide the necessary 13 kV capacity for a new network distribution system for the South Lake Union area, and provide additional capacity to manage loads in adjacent areas of downtown Seattle, including the Denny Triangle, Uptown, and First Hill Urban Centers; and

 WHEREAS, a new North Downtown substation will require new transmission service to power the substation; and

 WHEREAS, the 2009 Adopted Budget included provisos restricting the expenditure of appropriations for the North Downtown substation and North Downtown network until authorized by future ordinance; and

 WHEREAS, the City Light Department has provided policy guidelines for future network rate determinations in response to Council interest; and

 WHEREAS, lifting the budget provisos limiting spending of 2009 appropriations for the North Downtown substation and North Downtown network, and creating a new CIP project for the North Downtown substation transmission lines, will allow the City Light Department to proceed with design and environmental review of these CIP projects; NOW, THEREFORE,

 BE IT ORDAINED BY THE CITY OF SEATTLE AS FOLLOWS:

 Section 1. The restriction imposed by the following budget proviso, as adopted by Ordinance 122863 and amended by Ordinance 123078, is removed in its entirety and expenditure of all allocated amounts is no longer subject to restriction.
