 ORDINANCE _________________

 AN ORDINANCE declaring the former Fire Station 37 surplus to the City's needs, and authorizing the Director of the Department of Finance and Administrative Services to sell the site and building through an open competitive process.

 WHEREAS, the Fire Facilities and Emergency Response Levy Program ("Fire Facilities Program"), proposed under Ordinance 121230, was approved by Seattle voters on November 4, 2003; and

 WHEREAS, the Fire Facilities Program included funds for a new facility for Fire Station 37, which is now occupied, and neither the Seattle Fire Department nor the Department of Finance and Administrative Services (FAS) have current or future needs for the former Fire Station 37 ("former facility"); and

 WHEREAS, the funding plan for the Fire Facilities Program assumed that revenues from sales of surplus fire facilities would be deposited back into that program; and

 WHEREAS, by Resolution 30862, the City adopted amended Procedures for the Evaluation of the Reuse and Disposal of the City's Real Property, ("Procedures"), which established a uniform evaluation process for the reuse or disposal of real property the City owns in fee simple, including certain public notice and involvement procedures for decisions classified as complex; and

 WHEREAS, no other City department or other government agencies requested jurisdiction over, or proposed a public use fort his former facility; and

 WHEREAS, the zoning and historic designation of this former facility significantly limits the development potential and re-use possibilities; and

 WHEREAS, the public comments received by the Department of Finance and Administrative Services through its public notification and comment solicitation process generally support that there is limited redevelopment potential of this former facility for another public use and support the sale of this former facility; and

 WHEREAS, in view of the consistency of public comments with a public sale, the Executive proposes streamlining the disposition process, has included this streamlined approach in the Public Involvement Plan, which is included in Clerk File 311622, and has brought this legislation authorizing the sale of this former facility; and

 WHEREAS, public comments received as a result of circulating the Public Involvement Plan to interested neighbors and the community, signs posted at this former facility and related print and video media coverage, continue to support the sale of this former facility; and

 WHEREAS, Section 5.H of the Procedures recognizes the City Council may approve alternative procedures for the reuse or disposal evaluation process for specific properties, and that such alternative procedures do not set precedent for subsequent dispositions; and

 WHEREAS, it is in the interest of the City and the general public to sell this former facility rapidly to avoid negative impacts on neighborhoods from vacant properties;

 NOW, THEREFORE,

 BE IT ORDAINED BY THE CITY OF SEATTLE AS FOLLOWS:

 Section 1. The City of Seattle approves the steps taken as documented in the Public Involvement Section of the Final Report, which is included in Clerk File 311622, for the following described property in King County, Washington:

 as the alternate procedure to evaluate and dispose of the former facility pursuant to Section 5.H of the Procedures adopted as amended by Resolution 30862.

 Section 3. The Director of the Department of Finance and Administrative Services or his designee is authorized to offer the property identified in Section 1 for sale by a competitive process, and subject to the Director's approval, to accept the best offer for the property.
