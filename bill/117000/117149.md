 1. Purpose. Grantee shall have the right to use the Easement Area to construct, operate, maintain, repair, replace, improve, remove, or enlarge one or more utility systems for purposes of transmission and sale (serving) of natural gas to the property now known as the Charles Street Campus. Such facilities may include, but are not limited to:

 Pipes, pipelines, mains, laterals, conduits, regulators and feeders for natural gas serving the Charles Street Campus; or the following facilities if necessary or convenient for the purpose of serving natural gas to the Charles Street Campus: fiber optic cable and other lines, cables and facilities for communications; semi-buried or ground-mounted facilities and pads, manholes, meters, fixtures, attachments and any and all other facilities or appurtenances (individually or collectively facilities).

 Following the initial construction of all or a portion of the facilities serving the Charles Street Campus, Grantee may, from time to time, construct additional facilities as necessary or convenient for the purpose of serving the Charles Street Campus.

 2. Access to Easement Area. Grantee shall have the right of access to the Easement Area over and across the Property to enable Grantee to exercise its rights under this easement. Grantee shall compensate Grantor for any damage to the Property caused by the exercise of the Grantee's right of access.

 3. Maintenance of System. The Grantee shall; to the extent provided by the Grantee's applicable rates, tariffs, and law; be obligated to maintain and repair the facilities contained in the Easement Area.

 4. Grantor's Use of Easement Area. Grantor reserves the right to use the Easement Area for any purpose not inconsistent with the rights granted to the Grantee by this easement; provided, the Grantor shall not construct or maintain on the Easement Area any permanent or temporary building, structure, or other object that may damage or restrict access to Grantee's facilities. Grantor shall not; without Grantee's prior written consent, which shall not be unreasonably withheld; blast within 300 feet of Grantee's facilities.

 5. Indemnification and Hold Harmless. Grantee agrees to indemnify and hold harmless the Grantor from and against liability incurred by Grantor as a result of Grantee's negligence in the exercise of the rights granted to Grantee by this easement.

 6. Termination. Upon removal or deactivation of all or a portion of Grantee's facilities in the Easement Area, the Grantee shall if requested by the Grantor, execute and record a release of that portion of the Easement Area that will no longer be used by the Grantee.

 7. Abandonment. The rights granted by this easement shall continue until such time as Grantee ceases to use the Easement Area for five successive years; in which event the easement shall terminate and all rights under the easement and any facilities remaining in the Easement Area shall become the Grantor's property; provided, that abandonment shall not be deemed to have occurred by reason of the Grantee's failure to initially install its facilities on the Easement Area within any period of time from the date this easement is granted.

 8. Successors and Assigns. Grantee shall have the right to assign, apportion or otherwise transfer any or all of its rights, benefits, privileges and interests arising in and under this easement.
