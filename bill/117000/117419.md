 AN ORDINANCE relating to City employment; amending the Seattle Municipal Code (SMC) Section 4.04.030 to expand the definition of seniority for the purpose of determining layoff order.

 WHEREAS, pursuant to SMC 4.04.130(A), the Personnel Director is authorized to classify positions as appropriate; such change of a position's classification due to the gradual change of duties over a period of six months or longer that substantively changes its nature, scope or complexity is known as a "reclassification" and such change of a position's classification due to a deliberate management decision to assign to it a new body of work that substantively changes its nature, scope or complexity is known as a "reallocation," and;

 WHEREAS, pursuant to SMC 4.04.030(36) and SMC 4.04.030(25), respectively, a "transfer" is the movement of an employee from one position to another position in the same class, or with the same maximum pay rate, and a "reduction" is the movement of an employee from a higher-paid position to a lower-paid position, not for cause; and

 WHEREAS, the City seeks to establish a more equitable system for calculating seniority for the purpose of determining layoff order amongst civil service employees; and

 WHEREAS, the City believes such equity is best achieved by providing that employees shall have time completed in their previous classifications counted towards seniority in their current classifications if they moved to their current classification by way of reclassification, reallocation, transfer, and/or reduction.
