 AN ORDINANCE relating to Human Rights; amending sections 14.04.130, 14.06.090, and 14.08.150 of the Seattle Municipal Code to revise deadlines for appeal decisions by the Human Rights Commission.

 WHEREAS, the Seattle Office for Civil Rights (SOCR) receives, investigates, and passes upon charges brought by persons alleging unfair employment, housing, and public accommodation practices; and

 WHEREAS, if a determination is made by SOCR that there is no reasonable cause for believing an unfair practice has been committed, a charging party has a right to seek an appeal before the Human Right Commission (Commission); and

 WHEREAS, in cases involving unfair housing and public accommodation practices, if the Commission has not decided the appeal within 60 days from the date the appeal statement is filed, the determination of no reasonable cause is deemed final; and

 WHEREAS, the members of the Human Rights Commission serve without compensation and volunteer freely of their own time; and

 WHEREAS, because of the timing of the filing of appeals and scheduling conflicts among Commissioners, it is sometimes difficult for the Commission to fully consider and to render written appeals decisions within 60 days; and

 WHEREAS, in cases involving unfair employment practices, there is no deadline for the Commission to issue written appeals decisions; and

 WHEREAS, it is appropriate to extend the period in which the Commission should render decisions in housing and public accommodations appeals to 90 days and to establish a 90 day period for issuance of decisions in employment appeals; NOW, THEREFORE,
