 AN ORDINANCE amending Chapter 20.48 of the Seattle Municipal Code in order to modify City policies pertaining to capital appropriations.

 WHEREAS, it is the policy of the City of Seattle to finance capital projects in a cost-effective manner in order to maximize value to the public and to minimize public resources required; and

 WHEREAS, section 35.32A.030 of the Revised Code of Washington (RCW) requires that budgeted and appropriated expenditures not exceed estimated revenues, available balances, and revenue resulting from new legislation; and

 WHEREAS, RCW 35.32A.090 requires that contracts and payments not exceed allowances authorized in the final budget as adopted or modified; and

 WHEREAS, it is generally not cost-effective for the City and its public resources to legislate and secure all required financing in advance for multi-year, debt-financed capital projects, but it is often prudent and cost- effective to enter into multi-year contracts in order to secure favorable construction bids; and

 WHEREAS, in some cases, the City can most cost-effectively finance a project through multiple appropriations over time, resulting in the securitization of required resources over time, and the City's annual Adopted Six- Year Capital Improvement Program (CIP) contains anticipated future spending and appropriation amounts for City capital projects; NOW, THEREFORE,

 BE IT ORDAINED BY THE CITY OF SEATTLE AS FOLLOWS:

 Section 1. Section 20.48.030 of the Seattle Municipal Code as last amended by Ordinance 123361 is amended as follows:

 20.48.030 Funds to be available before entering into contract.

 ((~~Before the construction of any public work or improvement, or any part thereof, either by contract or by day labor, is authorized or begun under the direction and general supervision of the Director of Finance and Administrative Services, said Director shall obtain from the head of the City department for which such work is to be undertaken, such department head's certification that sufficient funds have been appropriated to cover the full cost and expense of completing the desired public work or improvement (which appropriations shall be identified, by ordinance number and, where appropriate, by Capital Improvement Project number, in such certification). No contract shall be entered into, nor shall the construction of such work or improvement, or any part thereof, be undertaken by said Director, unless there is a balance in the appropriation sufficient to cover such cost and expense. For contracts executed pursuant to Chapter 39.10 RCW, the Director or department head is authorized to enter into contracts without such certification, provided that no phase of any public work may be started unless sufficient funds have been appropriated to cover the full cost and expense of completing that phase.~~))  Before the Director of Finance and Administrative Services ("FAS Director") authorizes or enters into any contract for construction of a public work or improvement, the head of the City department for which the work is to be performed shall provide the FAS Director with written certification that sufficient funds have been appropriated to cover the full cost and expense of completing the contracted-for public work or improvement (which certification shall identify the appropriation by ordinance number and, where applicable, by Capital Improvement Program Project number). For any public works contract that is to be performed in phases or in more than one budget year, and where the full cost and expense of the project is not appropriated, the head of the City department will instead certify in writing that the contract price does not exceed the total amount identified as appropriated or allocated for the project in the most-recently Adopted Capital Improvement Program, less any amount already spent or encumbered, and that sufficient funds have been appropriated to cover the costs and expense of work anticipated to be performed in that budget year. In such event, the FAS Director shall ensure that the contract includes a provision allowing the City to terminate the contract for convenience without liability. The FAS Director may waive the certification required by this section in case of emergency as defined by applicable law.

 Section 2. This ordinance shall take effect and be in force 30 days after its approval by the Mayor, but if not approved and returned by the Mayor within ten days after presentation, it shall take effect as provided by Seattle Municipal Code Section 1.04.020.

 Passed by the City Council the ____ day of ________________________, 2011, and signed by me in open session in authentication of its passage this
