 Section 1. The permission granted to the Port of Seattle by Ordinance 120088 and amended by Ordinance 121855 to maintain and operate a pedestrian skybridge over and across Southwest Florida Street, east of 16th Avenue Southwest, is renewed for a ten-year period starting October 15, 2010, and ending at 11:59 p.m. on October 14, 2020, upon the terms and conditions set forth in Ordinance 120088, as amended by Ordinance 121855, and as further amended by this ordinance.

 Section 2. Sections 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, and 14 of Ordinance 120088, as amended by Ordinance 121855, are amended as follows:

 ***

 2.  Term.  The permission ((~~herein~~)) granted to the Permittee,  and  its successors and assigns as approved by the Director of the Seattle Department of Transportation (Director),  shall be for a term of ten ((~~(10)~~)) years, commencing on the effective date of this ordinance and terminating at 11:59 p.m. on the last day of the tenth year((~~; provided, however, that upon~~)) . Upon  written application of the Permittee at least ((~~thirty (30)~~))  180  days before expiration of the term, the Director ((~~of Transportation~~~~("Director")~~))  or the City Council  may renew the permit  twice, each time  for ((~~two (2)~~))  a  successive ten ((~~(10)~~)) - year ((~~terms, provided further that the~~))  term. The  total term of the permission ((~~as originally granted and thus extended~~)) , including renewals,  shall not exceed ((~~thirty (30)~~))  30  years, subject to the right of ((T)) t he City of Seattle ((~~("City")~~))  (City) to require the removal of the skybridge or to revise  by ordinance ((~~to then revise~~)) any of the terms and conditions ((~~contained herein~~))  of the permission granted by this ordinance .  The Permittee shall submit any application for a new permission no later than 180 days prior to the expiration of the then-existing term.

 3.  Protection of utilities.  The permission  granted  is ((~~hereby~~)) subject to  the Permittee bearing the expense of  any protection, support ,  or relocation of existing utilities((~~,~~)) deemed necessary by ((~~a utility company, shall be done at the Permittee's expense,~~))  the owners of the utilities,  and the Permittee ((~~shall be~~))  being  responsible for any subsequent damage to the utilities due to construction ((~~or settlement~~)) , repair, reconstruction, maintenance, operation, or removal of the skybridge .

 4.  Removal for public use or for cause.  The ((~~permit~~))  permission  granted ((~~hereby~~)) is subject to ((~~primary and secondary~~)) use  of the street right-of-way or other public place  by the  City and the  public for travel ,  ((~~and~~)) utility purposes, and  other public uses or benefits. The  City expressly reserves the right to  deny renewal, or terminate the permission at any time prior to expiration of the initial term or any renewal term, and  require the Permittee to remove the ((~~pedestrian~~)) skybridge , or any part thereof or installation thereon,  at  the  Permittee's sole cost and expense in the event that:

 a) The City Council determines((~~,~~)) by ordinance((~~,~~)) that the space occupied by the ((~~pedestrian~~)) skybridge is necessary for any ((~~primary or secondary~~)) public use or benefit or that the ((~~pedestrian~~)) skybridge interferes with any ((~~primary or secondary~~)) public use or benefit; or

 b) The Director ((~~of Transportation ("Director")~~)) determines  that the use of the skybridge has been abandoned; or

 c) The Director determines  that any term or condition of this ordinance has been violated((~~,~~)) and ((~~such~~))  the  violation has not been corrected((~~, after notice of violation having been given~~))  by the Permittee by the compliance date after a written request  by the City  to correct the violation (unless a notice to correct is not required due to an immediate threat to the health or safety of the public) .

 A City Council determination that the space is ((~~necessary~~))  needed  for ((~~a primary or secondary~~)) , or the skybridge interferes with, a  public use or benefit ((~~shall be~~))  is  conclusive and final  without any right of the Permittee to resort to the courts to adjudicate the matter .

 5.  Permittee's obligation to remove and restore.  ((~~In the event that the permit~~))  If the permission granted  is not renewed  at the expiration of a term , or  if the  permission ((~~hereby granted extends~~~~to its termination in thirty (30) years, or the City orders removal of the pedestrian skybridge pursuant to the terms of this ordinance~~))  expires without an application for a new permission being granted, or if the City terminates the permission , then within ((~~ninety (90)~~))  90  days after ((~~such~~))  the  expiration((~~, termination or order of removal~~))  or termination of permission , or prior to ((~~the~~))  any earlier  date stated in an ((~~"Order to Remove", as the case may be,~~))  ordinance or order requiring removal of the skybridge,  the Permittee shall , at its own expense,  remove the ((~~pedestrian~~)) skybridge and ((~~shall place~~))  and all the Permittee's equipment and property and replace and restore  all portions of the street  right-of-way or public place  that may have been disturbed for any part of the ((~~structure,~~))  skybridge  in as good condition for public use as they were prior to construction((~~,~~))  of the skybridge  and in at least as good condition in all respects as the abutting portions ((~~thereof. Whereupon, the~~))  of the right-of-way as required by the applicable SDOT standards for right-of-way restoration.

 Failure to remove the skybridge as required by this section is a violation of Chapter 15.90 of the Seattle Municipal Code (SMC) (or successor provision), provided that applicability of Chapter 15.90 does not eliminate any remedies available to the City under this ordinance or any other authority. If the Permittee does not timely fulfill its obligations under this section, the City may in its sole discretion remove the skybridge and restore the street right- of-way or public place at the Permittee's expense, and collect such expense in the manner provided by law.

 Upon the Permittee's completion of removal and restoration in accordance with this section, or upon the City's completion of the removal and restoration and Permittee's payment to the City of the City's costs in connection therewith, the  Director shall  then  issue a ((~~certificate~~~~discharging~~))  certification that  the Permittee ((~~from responsibility~~))  has fulfilled its removal and restoration obligations  under this ordinance ((~~for occurrences after the date of such discharge~~)).  Upon prior notice to the Permittee and entry of written findings that it is in the public interest, the Director may, in the Director's sole discretion, conditionally or absolutely excuse the Permittee from compliance with all or any of the Permittee's obligations under this section.

After  written  notice to the Permittee  and failure of the Permittee to correct an unsafe condition within the time stated in the notice , the Director may order the ((~~pedestrian~~)) skybridge  be  closed  or removed at the Permittee's expense  if the Director deems that it has become unsafe or creates a risk of injury to the public. ((~~In a situation in which~~))  If  there is an immediate threat to the health or safety of the public,  a  notice  to correct  is not required.

 8.  Continuing obligations.  Notwithstanding termination or expiration of the permission granted, or closure or removal of the ((~~pedestrian~~)) skybridge, the Permittee shall remain bound by all of its obligations under this ordinance until((~~: (a) the pedestrian skybridge and all its equipment and property are removed from the street; (b) the area is cleared and restored in a manner and to a condition satisfactory to the Director; and (c) the Director certifies that the Permittee has discharged its obligation herein. Provided, that upon prior notice to the Permittee and entry of written findings that such is in the public interest, the Director may, in his/her sole discretion, excuse the Permittee, conditionally or absolutely, from compliance with all or any of the Permittee's obligation to remove the pedestrian skybridge and its property and restore disturbed areas~~))  the Director has issued a certification that the Permittee has fulfilled its removal and restoration obligations under Section 5 of this ordinance.
