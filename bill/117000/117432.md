 1.  Permission.  Subject to the terms and conditions of this ordinance,  the City of Seattle (City) grants  permission ((~~is hereby granted~~))  (also referred to in this ordinance as a permit)  to ((~~Red Hook Ale Brewery, Inc.~~))  Fremont Dock Co., and  its successors and assigns ((~~("Permittee")~~))  as approved by the Director of the Seattle Department of Transportation (Director) according to Section 12A of this ordinance (the party named above and each approved successor and assign is referred to as Permittee),  to ((~~construct,~~)) maintain and operate a utility tunnel  (tunnel)  under and across Phinney Avenue North, north of North 34th Street ,  ((~~connecting Red Hook Ale Brewery, Inc. buildings, said utility~~))  said  tunnel ((~~will be~~))  being  approximately 8 feet wide  and  approximately 7 feet high and situated approximately 75 feet north of the centerline of North 34th Street((~~.~~)) , adjacent in whole or in part to the property legally described as:

 Lots 22 through 25, inclusive, Block 48, Denny & Hoyt's Addition to the City of Seattle, according to the plat thereof recorded in Volume 2 of Plats, page 136, in King County, Washington,

 EXCEPT the portions thereof condemned by the City of Seattle for street purposes in King County Superior Court Cause Number 54569, AND EXCEPT that portion of said Lot 25 conveyed to the City of Seattle for street purposes under Recording Number 907225.

 2.  Term.  The permission ((~~herein~~)) granted to the Permittee((~~, its successors and assigns shall be~~))  is  for a term of ten ((~~(10)~~)) years, ((~~commencing~~))  starting  on the effective date of this ordinance and ((~~terminating~~))  ending  at 11:59 p.m. on the last day of the tenth year((~~; provided, however, that upon~~)) . Upon  written application of the Permittee at least ((~~30~~))  180  days before expiration of the term, the Director ((~~of Transportation ("Director")~~))  or the City Council  may renew the permit ((~~for two~~))  twice, each time for a  successive ten - year ((~~terms, provided further that the total term of the permission as originally granted and thus extended shall not exceed 30 years~~))  term , subject to the right of the City to ((~~revise the fee provided for in Section 13 hereof, and~~))  require the removal of the tunnel or to revise  by ordinance ((~~to then revise~~)) any of the terms and conditions ((~~contained herein~~))  of the permission granted by this ordinance. The total term of the permission, including renewals, shall not exceed 30 years. The Permittee shall submit any application for a new permission no later than 180 days prior to the expiration of the then-existing term .

 3 A .  Removal for public use or for cause.  The ((~~permit~~))  permission  granted ((~~hereby~~)) is subject to ((~~the primary and secondary~~)) use  of the street right- of-way or other public place (collectively public place)  by the  City and the  public for travel ((~~and utilities~~)) , utility  purposes, ((~~and~~))  and other public uses or benefits.  The City ((~~of Seattle ("City")~~)) expressly reserves the right to  deny renewal, or terminate the permission at any time prior to expiration of the initial term or any renewal term, and  require the Permittee to remove the ((~~utility~~)) tunnel , or any part thereof or installation on the public place  at  the  Permittee's sole cost and expense in the event that:

 (a) the City Council determines by ordinance that the space occupied by the ((~~utility~~)) tunnel is necessary for any ((~~primary and secondary~~)) public use or benefit or that the ((~~utility~~)) tunnel interferes with any ((~~primary and secondary~~)) public use or benefit; or

 (b) the ((~~Board of Public Works or successor bond or official of the City ("Board")~~))  Director  determines that  use of the tunnel has been abandoned; or

 (c)  the Director determines that  any term or condition of this ordinance has been violated , and the violation has not been corrected by the Permittee by the compliance date after a written request by the City to correct the violation (unless a notice to correct is not required due to an immediate threat to the health or safety of the public) .

 A City Council determination that the space is ((~~necessary~~))  needed  for , or the tunnel interferes with,  a ((~~primary and secondary~~)) public use or benefit ((~~shall be~~))  is  conclusive and final  without any right of the Permittee to resort to the courts to adjudicate the matter .

 3B. Protection of utilities. The permission granted is subject to the Permittee bearing the expense of any protection, support, or relocation of existing utilities deemed necessary by the owners of the utilities, and the Permittee being responsible for any damage to the utilities due to the construction, repair, reconstruction, maintenance, operation, or removal of the tunnel and for any consequential damages that may result from any damage to utilities or interruption in service caused by any of the foregoing .

 4.  Permittee's obligation to remove and restore.  ((~~In the event that the permit is not renewed, or~~))  If  the permission ((~~hereby~~)) granted ((~~extends to its termination in 30 years~~))  is not renewed at the expiration of a term, or if the permission expires without an application for a new permission being granted , or  if  the City ((~~orders~~))  terminates the permission, then within 90 days after the expiration or termination of the permission, or prior to any earlier date stated in an ordinance or order requiring  removal of the ((~~utility~~)) tunnel ((~~pursuant to the terms of this ordinance, then within 90 days after such expiration, termination or order of removal, or prior to the date stated in an Order to Remove, as the case may be~~)), the Permittee shall , at its own expense,  remove the ((~~utility~~)) tunnel and  all of the Permittee's equipment and property from the public place. Following removal of the tunnel, the Permittee  shall ((~~place~~))  replace and restore  all portions of the ((~~street~~))  public place  that may have been disturbed for any part of the ((~~structure,~~))  tunnel. The public place shall be replaced and restored  in as good condition for public use as ((~~they were~~))  it was  prior to construction((~~, and,~~))  of the tunnel and  in at least as good condition in all respects as the abutting portions ((~~thereof~~))  of the public place as required by SDOT right-of-way restoration standards . ((~~Whereupon, the Board shall issue a certificate discharging Permittee from responsibilities under this ordinance for occurrences after the date of such discharge.~~))

 Failure to remove the tunnel as required by this section is a violation of Chapter 15.90 of the Seattle Municipal Code (SMC) or successor provision; however, applicability of Chapter 15.90 does not eliminate any remedies available to the City under this ordinance or any other authority. If the Permittee does not timely fulfill its obligations under this section, the City may in its sole discretion remove the tunnel and restore the public place at the Permittee's expense, and collect the expenses in any manner provided by law.

 Upon the Permittee's completion of removal and restoration in accordance with this section, or upon the City's completion of the removal and restoration and the Permittee's payment to the City for the City's removal and restoration costs, the Director shall then issue a certification that the Permittee has fulfilled its removal and restoration obligations under this ordinance.

The tunnel shall remain the exclusive responsibility of the Permittee and the Permittee shall maintain the tunnel in good and safe condition for the protection of the public.

 6.  Failure to correct unsafe condition.  After  written  notice to the Permittee((~~, the Board~~))  and failure of the Permittee to correct an unsafe condition within the time stated in the notice, the Director  may order the ((~~utility~~)) tunnel  be  closed  or removed at the Permittee's expense  if the ((~~Board~~))  Director  deems that ((~~it~~))  the tunnel  has become unsafe or creates a risk of injury to the public.  If there is an immediate threat to the health or safety of the public, a notice to correct is not required.

 7.  Continuing obligations.  Notwithstanding termination or expiration of the permission granted, or closure or removal of the ((~~utility~~)) tunnel, the Permittee shall remain bound by  all of  its obligation s  under this ordinance until((~~:~~

~~(a) the utility tunnel and all its equipment and property are removed for the street,~~
