 AN ORDINANCE relating to adult entertainment licenses and other licenses; amending Sections 6.202.180, 6.202.280, 6.270.070, 6.270.080 and 6.270.090 of the Seattle Municipal Code to establish deadlines for reviewing applications for adult entertainment licenses; require that applicants present written evidence that they are the owner, operator, or lessee of the premises; clarify that review for compliance with City development regulations including zoning and building codes occurs as part of the development regulation process rather than the licensing process; clarify standards for the review of applications for adult entertainment manager and adult entertainer licenses; and provide that an adult entertainment license application be denied to an applicant that is currently the subject of an adult entertainment license suspension or revocation order.

 WHEREAS, on July 19, 2010 the U.S. District Court ruled that Seattle's adult entertainment premises license code was facially unconstitutional because it failed to establish time limits for acting upon a license application; and

 WHEREAS, portions of the Seattle Municipal Code (SMC) that relate to the regulation of adult entertainment licenses need to be amended to include deadlines for reviewing adult entertainment license applications; and

 WHEREAS, it has been determined that other portions of the SMC relating to adult entertainment licensing should be amended to clarify that compliance with zoning and building codes is determined as part of the development regulation process rather than the licensing process, to provide that an applicant for an adult entertainment premises license must show that the applicant is the current owner, operator or lessee of the premises, and to clarify standards for the review of applications for adult entertainment manager and adult entertainer licenses; NOW, THEREFORE,

 BE IT ORDAINED BY THE CITY OF SEATTLE AS FOLLOWS:

 Section 1. Section 6.202.180 of the Seattle Municipal Code, enacted by Ordinance 108934, is amended to read as follows:

 6.202.180 Change of Location

 A. Reinspection is required for every change of location, if a building, fire, health, or license site inspection of premises was required by the new license code at the original location. An inspection fee shall be imposed for each inspection visit to the new site.

 B. Whenever a licensee changes the location of any activity for which a license is required, the Director shall reissue the license upon finding that:

 1. The licensee has submitted the license to the Director for the change, and any change of location and inspection fees imposed by the new license code have been paid; and

 2. The new location is in compliance with all provisions of the new license code relating to the premises ((~~and with applicable zoning, building, fire, and health ordinances, and laws, rules and regulations promulgated thereunder~~)).

 C. Nothing in this Section 6.202.180 is intended to authorize activities, actions or conditions that do not comply with other requirements of the Seattle Municipal Code or other applicable law, including but not limited to applicable development regulations (including but not limited to zoning and building codes), fire and health ordinances, laws, rules and regulations.

 Section 2. Subsection B of Section 6.202.280 of the Seattle Municipal Code, which section was last amended by Ordinance 117586, is amended to read as follows:

 * * *

 B. If the Department denies an adult entertainment license governed by ((~~SMC~~)) Chapter 6.270, and if the license applicant files a notice of appeal with the Hearing Examiner, the Director shall immediately issue the license applicant a temporary license. The temporary license shall authorize the license applicant to operate an adult entertainment establishment or perform as a manager or entertainer, in the same manner as if the license had been granted, pending the Hearing Examiner's decision , provided the licensee has obtained whatever other licenses, permits or approvals are required by law for such operation or performance .

 1. If the Hearing Examiner affirms the Director's license denial, the temporary license shall remain in effect  (a) until the expiration of the time allowed to file a motion for reconsideration before the Hearing Examiner, or if a timely motion for reconsideration has been filed,  ((~~pending a~~))  until the Hearing Examiner renders a decision on the motion for reconsideration ((~~before the Hearing Examiner~~))and,  (b) in addition ,  ((~~(a) if the license applicant does not timely file for judicial review, then only~~)) until the expiration of the time allowed to file an application for a writ of review under Chapter 7.16 RCW((~~; or (b)~~)) , or  if the license applicant does timely file an application for a writ of review, then only until the  superior  court ((~~either issues a writ or denies the writ application~~))  enters judgment on, dismisses, or otherwise disposes of the writ .

 2. If the Hearing Examiner ((~~dismisses~~)) reverses  the adult entertainment license denial with prejudice, the Department shall immediately issue an adult entertainment license.

 3. If the Hearing Examiner ((~~dismisses~~))  reverses  the adult entertainment  license  denial without prejudice, the temporary license shall remain in effect for five ((~~(5)~~)) additional business days, at the end of which time the Department must either reissue a denial or issue an adult entertainment license. If the Director reissues the denial, then the temporary license will continue in effect according to the procedures set forth in  this  subsection ((~~B of this section~~))  6.202.280.B .

 4. Notwithstanding ((~~SMC~~)) Section 6.202.210, if a license applicant is issued a temporary license, the license applicant shall pay the fee charged for an adult entertainment license under ((~~SMC~~)) Section 6.270.060 at the time the applicant receives the temporary license. If the temporary license issued under this subsection  6.202.280.B  is still in effect at the end of a calendar year, then the license applicant must pay the fee charged for an adult entertainment license under ((~~SMC~~)) Section 6.270.060 for the next calendar year.

 Section 3. Subsection A of Section 6.270.070 of the Seattle Municipal Code, which section was last amended by Ordinance 123361, is amended to read as follows:
