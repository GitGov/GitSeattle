 Tom Hauger/Patrice Carroll / Ketil Freeman LEG 2011 Comp Plan Amendments ORD March 6, 2012 Version #4

 Attachment A

 Container Port Element

 LAND USE POLICIES

 CP/LU1 Help preserve cargo container activities by retaining industrial designations on land that supports marine and rail- related industries including industrial land adjacent to rail or water-dependent transportation facilities.

 CP/LU2 Continue to monitor the land area needs, including for expansion, of cargo container-related activities and take action to prevent the loss of needed land that can serve these activities.

 CP/LU3 Discourage non-industrial land uses, such as retail and residential, in industrially-zoned areas to minimize conflicts between uses and to prevent conversion of industrial land in the vicinity of cargo container terminals or their support facilities.

 CP/LU4 Consider how zoning designations may affect the definition of highest and best use, with the goal of maintaining the jobs and revenue that cargo container activities generate and to protect scarce industrial land supply for cargo container industries, such as marine and rail-related industries.

 CP/LU5 Consider the value of transition areas at the edges of general industrial zones which allow a wider range of uses while not creating conflicts with preferred cargo container activities and uses. In this context, zoning provisions such as locational criteria and development standards are among the tools for defining such edge areas.

 TRANSPORTATION POLICIES

 CP/T1 Monitor, maintain and improve key freight corridors, networks and intermodal connections that provide access to cargo container facilities and the industrial areas around them to address bottlenecks and other access constraints. Provide safe, reliable, efficient and direct access between Port marine facilities and the state highway or interstate system, and between Port terminals and railroad intermodal facilities, recognizing that Port operations must address other transportation needs, such as pedestrian safety.

 CP/T2 Make operational, design, access and capital investments to accommodate trucks and maintain successful railroad operations and preserve mobility of goods and services. Improvements may include, but are not limited to, improvement of pavement conditions, commute trip reduction strategies, including through transportation management associations, roadway re-channelization to minimize modal conflicts, use of intelligent transportation systems, construction of critical facility links, and grade separation of modes, especially at heavily used railroad crossings.

 CP/T3 Maintain the City's classification of "Major Truck Streets." Because freight is important to the basic economy of the City and has unique right-of-way needs to support that role, freight will be the major priority on streets classified as Major Truck Streets. Street improvements that are consistent with freight mobility but also support other modes may be considered in these streets.

 CP/T4 Identify emerging cargo container freight transportation issues and work with affected stakeholder groups, including the Seattle Freight Advisory Board. Provide regular opportunities for communication between the City, the freight community, other affected communities, and other agencies and stakeholders.

 CP/T5 Continue joint City and Port efforts to implement relevant Port recommendations such as recommendations contained in the Container Terminal Access Study.

 CP/T6 Given the importance of cargo container terminal operations to the state and regional economies, develop partnerships within the City, the Port, the region and the State to advocate for project prioritization and timely funding to improve and maintain freight infrastructure, and explore funding partnerships.

 CP/T7 Maintain consistency between local, regional and State freight-related policies.

 ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT POLICIES

 CP/ED1 Encourage the siting of new businesses that support the goals for cargo container activities in designated Manufacturing /Industrial Centers.

 CP/ED2 Work cooperatively with other agencies to address the effects of major land use and transportation projects to avoid or mitigate construction and operational effects on the cargo container industry sector.

 CP/ED3 Facilitate the creation of coalitions of industrial businesses, vocational training and other educational institutions and public agencies to help develop training programs to move trained workers into cargo container related jobs.

 ENVIRONMENTAL POLICIES

 CP/E1 Identify opportunities to achieve economic, community, and environmental benefits from the development and operations of cargo container related activities.

 CP/E2 Form partnerships with non-profit, community-based, private and public stakeholders to establish environmental improvement goals, including carbon emission reductions, storm water management, redevelopment and clean-up of existing marine industrial properties, sustainable design, and fish and wildlife habitat improvements. Develop strategies to achieve these goals that include developing funding mechanisms and legislative support.

 CP/E3 Work with non-profit, community-based, private and public stakeholders to formulate plans for public open space, shoreline access, and fish and wildlife habitat improvements that incorporate community needs and area-wide habitat priorities with the need to maintain sufficient existing marine industrial lands for present and anticipated cargo container needs.
