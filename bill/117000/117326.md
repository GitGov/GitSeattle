 WHEREAS, City Light anticipates both reduced expenditures and increased revenues relative to the 2011 Adopted Budget; NOW, THEREFORE

 BE IT ORDAINED BY THE CITY OF SEATTLE AS FOLLOWS:

 Section 3. Any action consistent with this ordinance taken after its passage but prior to its effective date is ratified and confirmed.
