 AN ORDINANCE relating to the Seattle Department of Parks and Recreation; authorizing the Superintendent to amend and restate the existing Operation and Maintenance Agreement between the Seattle Department of Parks and Recreation and the Seattle Art Museum, concerning their roles in operation and maintenance of portions of Alaskan Way Boulevard and Myrtle Edwards Park that are operated as part of the Olympic Sculpture Park.

 WHEREAS, in 2006, the City Council authorized the initial agreement between the Seattle Department of Parks and Recreation (DPR) and the Seattle Art Museum (SAM) by adopting Ordinance 122141; and

 WHEREAS, in the 2006 agreement, SAM was responsible, during the plant establishment period, but no longer than three years after plant installation, for routine maintenance of the plantings and vegetation related to the Embayment located in Myrtle Edwards Park, after which time maintenance became the responsibility of DPR; and

 WHEREAS, SAM has continued with this effort since establishment of the Embayment and is now requesting to continue their maintenance and planting responsibility for an additional three years from the effective date of this amendment; and

 WHEREAS, the amendment would also allow for subsequent extensions of the term, not to exceed the remainder of the twenty-five year term of the Operation and Maintenance Agreement; and

 WHEREAS, DPR would like to accept SAM's offer for continuing their maintenance responsibilities for the Embayment in Myrtle Edwards Park; and

 WHEREAS, extending this agreement ensures that the new beach in Myrtle Edwards Park will continue to be maintained at its current level; and

 WHEREAS, both parties have agreed to the attached amendment; NOW, THEREFORE,

 BE IT ORDAINED BY THE CITY OF SEATTLE AS FOLLOWS:

 Section 1. The Superintendent of Parks and Recreation is authorized to execute, for and on behalf of the City of Seattle, an amended and restated Operation and Maintenance Agreement with the Seattle Art Museum, in substantially the form attached hereto as Attachment 1, or with such minor additions, modifications, or deletions as the Mayor or Superintendent deems to be in the best interest to the City.
