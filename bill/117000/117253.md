 ORDINANCE _________________

 AN ORDINANCE relating to the Department of Parks and Recreation; authorizing the acquisition of real property commonly known as 3656 34th Avenue South and 3640 35th Avenue South; authorizing acceptance and recording of deeds for open space, park, and recreation purposes; and increasing appropriations to the Department of Parks and Recreation in the 2011 Budget; all by a three-fourths vote of the City Council.

 WHEREAS, by Resolution 31055 the City Council created the Parks and Green Spaces Levy Citizens' Advisory Committee to ensure citizen participation in the development of a potential package of parks, open space, boulevards, trails, green infrastructure, and recreation projects, and a proposed set of options to fund the package; and

 WHEREAS, the Parks and Green Spaces Levy Citizens' Advisory Committee, after being duly appointed and after spending many hours in open meetings and receiving public testimony and deliberating on the levy, voted by a strong majority to recommend that the City Council place a $145.5 million six-year levy proposal for park purposes before the voters of Seattle; and

 WHEREAS, in response to this recommendation, the City Council passed Ordinance 122749, placing Proposition 2, the 2008 Parks and Green Spaces Levy, before the voters of Seattle; and

 WHEREAS, the 2008 Parks and Green Spaces Levy was approved by Seattle voters on November 4, 2008; and

 WHEREAS, Ordinance 122749 identifies the North Rainier Hub Urban Village for a potential neighborhood park acquisition; and

 WHEREAS, the Department of Parks and Recreation considers the North Rainier Hub Urban Village as significantly underserved with quality open space, and the area is, therefore, a priority area for additional acquisition of parks and open space; and

 WHEREAS, two adjacent properties located at 3656 34th Avenue South and 3640 35th Avenue South are well suited for open space, park, and recreation uses; and

 WHEREAS, the City has determined that the purchase of the adjacent properties located at 3656 34th Avenue South and 3640 35th Avenue South will provide a new neighborhood park that meets the criteria to address open space needs established in Seattle's Parks and Recreation 2006 Development Plan, and Seattle's 2006 Open Space Gap Report Update, and that it is in the public's best interest to acquire the same for open space, park, and recreation purposes; NOW, THEREFORE,

 BE IT ORDAINED BY THE CITY OF SEATTLE AS FOLLOWS:
