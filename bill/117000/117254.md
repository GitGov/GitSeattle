 Attachment 1: Amendments to City of Seattle 2011 Annual Allocation Plan

 Attachment 2: Amendments to Housing Policies

 Attachment 1: Amendments to City of Seattle 2011 Annual Allocation Plan

 Section 4 -- 2011 Annual Allocation Plan

 Section 4 -- 2011 Annual Allocation Plan

 City of Seattle 2011 Revised Annual Allocation Plan rev. August 3, 2011

 The 2011 Annual Allocation Plan is the proposed one-year spending plan for Consolidated Plan funds for the City's 2011 fiscal year. These allocations are aligned with the strategies and objectives as described in the 2009 -- 2012 Consolidated Plan, as amended.  This revision aligns our proposed allocations, adopted in November 2010, with the actual amount of funds available from US HUD and program income.

 Specifically regarding the CDBG program, the allocation of $11,958,852 is composed of the following revenues: direct allocation from HUD of $10,729,471; $400,000 in program income accumulated from prior years to support the allocation of funds for the Home Repair Program; $110,000 in current year program income from the repayment of affordable rental housing loans, to be used to support the allocation of funds for Rental Housing Preservation & Production; $300,000 in current year program income from repayments of homebuyer loans, to be used to support the allocation of funds for Homebuyer Programs; and amounts required by HUD to be paid from other sources to the extent available (not reflected in the table below), including $300,000 in current year program income from HomeWise Program loan repayments to be used as general revenue for CDBG activities and $119,381 in unexpended prior years' funds carried forward to support 2011 activities.

 NOTE: The contents of this Plan are not intended to confer any legal rights or entitlements on any persons, groups, or entities, including those named as intended recipients of funds or as program beneficiaries. The terms of this Annual Allocation Plan are subject to amendment and to the effect of applicable laws, regulations and ordinances. Statements of numerical goals or outcomes are for the purpose of measuring the success of programs and policies and do not impose a legal obligation on the City to achieve the intended results. Actual funding of particular programs and projects identified in this Plan is subject to completion of various further actions, some of which involve discretionary determinations by the City or others. These include HUD approval of this Plan; appropriations by the United States Congress and the City Council; reviews and determinations under environmental and related laws; and results of bidding and contracting processes.

 ATTACHMENT 1 to 2011 Substantial Amendment to the Consolidated Plan Amendments to City of Seattle 2011 Annual Allocation Plan

 Section 4 - Annual Allocation Plan (APP)

 Attachment 2: Amendments to Housing Policies

 ATTACHMENT 2 to the 2011 Substantial Amendment to the Consolidated Plan

 Amendments to Housing Policies

 The introduction and the subsection entitled "Affordability Policies for Federal HOME and CDBG Funds" in Section 7.1.3, "Housing Policies," of the 2009-2012 Consolidated Plan, as previously amended, most recently by the 2011 Update to the 2009 -- 2012 Consolidated Plan adopted by Ordinance 123438, are amended as follows:

 ***

 These Consolidated Plan housing policies pertain to all capital funds administered by the Seattle Office of Housing (OH) unless otherwise noted. Policies for rental assistance funds administered by the Seattle Human Services Department (HSD) are also included. Please refer to the currently applicable City of Seattle Housing Levy Administrative & Financial Plan for additional policies governing the use of funds derived from current and prior housing levies, and in some cases governing other funds.

 In this Housing Policies section of the Consolidated Plan only, the definitions for extremely low-income, very low- income, low-income, and median income  in the Program Definitions section ((~~as adopted~~))~~~~in the ((~~current~~))2009 Housing Levy Administrative and Financial Plan , adopted by Ordinance 123281,  shall apply , except that for purposes of HOME funds, "low-income" shall not exceed the applicable HOME low-income limit for the Seattle-Bellevue Fair Market Rent Area, as established by the U.S. Department of Housing & Urban Development (HUD) .

 ((~~?Extremely low-income means incomes not exceeding the Section 8 Program 2010 30% of median limits published by HUD for the Seattle-Bellevue HMFA, adjusted for household size.~~

~~?Very low-income means incomes not exceeding the Section 8 Program 2010 very low-income limits published by HUD for the Seattle-Bellevue HMFA, adjusted for household size.~~

~~?Low-income means incomes not exceeding the Section 8 Program 2010 low-income limits published by HUD for the Seattle-Bellevue HMFA, adjusted for household size.~~

~~?Median income means annual family income for the Seattle-Bellevue, WA HUD Metro FMR Area, as published from time to time by the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD), with adjustments according to household size in a manner determined by the Director, which adjustments shall be based upon a method used by HUD to adjust income limits in subsidized housing, and which adjustments for purposes of determining affordability of rents or sale prices shall be based on the average size of household considered to correspond to the size of the housing unit (one (1) person for studio units and one and a half (1.5) persons per bedroom for other units.)~~))

 ***

 Affordability Policies for Federal HOME and CDBG funds

 The policies described in this section apply only to HOME and CDBG funds appropriated for use in the  2011 -2012 biennium :

 ? At least 50% of  the combined total of CDBG and HOME rental program funds shall be used for units with affordable rents for extremely low-income households;

 ? Remaining  CDBG and HOME  rental program funds ((~~may~~)) must  be used for units with affordable rents for  extremely low-income households and/or other very low-income households.

 For the purposes of the Housing Policies section of the Consolidated Plan "affordable rent" for low-income households means annual rent not exceeding 30% of the income limits for low-income households; "affordable rent" for very low-income households means an annual rent not exceeding 30% of the limits for very low-income households; and "affordable rent" for extremely low- income households means an annual rent not exceeding 30% of the limits for extremely low-income households. For the purposes of determining whether a unit bears affordable rent, the term "rent" includes the rent paid by the tenant plus an allowance for utilities paid by the tenant.

 ((~~Except as provide in the current 2009 Housing Levy Administrative & Financial Plan, program funds are to be used only for units that are occupied or will be initially occupied by eligible households at affordable rents for the respective income categories.~~))
