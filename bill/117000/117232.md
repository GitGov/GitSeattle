 AN ORDINANCE relating to rates and charges for water services of Seattle Public Utilities; revising water rates and charges and amending Seattle Municipal Code Chapter 21.04 in connection therewith; removing Water District 61 and Richmond Beach Area meter surcharges and amending Seattle Municipal Code 21.12 in connection therewith; and revising credits to low-income customers and amending Seattle Municipal Code Chapter 21.76 in connection therewith.

 WHEREAS, capital and operating requirements of the Water Fund have increased in recent years in response to security, environmental and infrastructure concerns, with a resulting increase in the revenue requirements of the Water Fund; and

 WHEREAS, demand for water service and new water installations have declined since water rates were last modified, causing revenue shortfalls; and

 WHEREAS, certain sections of the Seattle Municipal Code pertaining to water rates are obsolete; and

 WHEREAS, Seattle's retail water customers located within the areas of the former Richmond Beach Water Company and former King County Water District No. 61 have reimbursed Seattle Public Utilities for the costs of their respective acquisitions and resulting required improvements, so that surcharges on these customers are no longer required; and

 WHEREAS, the water rates authorized by this ordinance are consistent with the general ratemaking policies set forth in Resolution 30742, adopted March 28, 2005; and
