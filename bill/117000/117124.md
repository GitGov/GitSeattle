 23.49.020 Demonstration of LEED Silver rating((~~.~~))

 A. Applicability. This section applies if a commitment to earn a LEED Silver rating or substantially equivalent standard is a condition of a permit.

 B. The Director is authorized to determine, as a Type I decision, whether the applicant has demonstrated that a new structure has earned a LEED Silver rating or met a substantially equivalent standard. The Director may establish by rule procedures for determining whether an applicant has demonstrated that a new structure has earned a LEED Silver rating or met any such substantially equivalent standard, provided that no rule shall assign authority for making a final determination to any person other than an officer of the Department of Planning and Development or another City agency with regulatory authority and expertise in green building practices.

 C. Demonstration of Compliance; Penalties.

 1. The applicant shall demonstrate to the Director the extent to which the applicant has complied with the commitment to earn a LEED Silver rating no later than ((~~90~~)) 180  days after issuance of final Certificate of Occupancy for the new structure, or such later date as may be allowed by the Director for good cause, by submitting a report analyzing the extent credits were earned toward such rating from the U.S. Green Building Council or another independent entity approved by the Director. For purposes of this Section 23.49.020, if the Director ((~~shall have~~)) has  approved ((~~a commitment to achieve~~)) a substantially equivalent standard, the term "LEED Silver rating" shall mean such other standard.

 2. Failure to submit a timely report regarding a LEED Silver rating from an approved independent entity by the date required is a violation of the Land Use Code. The penalty for such violation is $500 per day from the date that the report was due to the date it is submitted((~~, without any requirement of notice to the applicant~~)).  The owner is subject to this fine regardless of whether the City provides the owner with notice that the report is overdue or that the fine is accruing.

 3. Failure to demonstrate, through an independent report as provided in this subsection, full compliance with the applicant's commitment to earn a LEED Silver rating, is a violation of the Land Use Code. The penalty for each violation is an amount determined as follows:

 P = [(LSM-CE)/LSM] x CV x 0.0075,

 where:

 P is the penalty;

 LSM is the minimum number of credits to earn a LEED Silver rating;

 CE is the number of credits earned as documented by the report; and

 CV is the Construction Value as set forth on the building permit for the new structure.

 Example:

 Construction Value $200,000,000.00

 Minimum LEED Credits for Silver rating 33

 Credits Earned 32

 Penalty = [(33-32)/33] x

 200,000,000 x .0075 = $45,454.55

 4. Failure to comply with the applicant's commitment to earn a LEED Silver rating is a violation of the Land Use Code independent of the failure to demonstrate compliance; however, such violation shall not affect the right to occupy any chargeable floor area, and if a penalty is paid in the amount determined under subsection 23.49.020.C.3, no additional penalty shall be imposed for the failure to comply with the commitment.

</table> *Except as provided in subsection 23.49.056.A.2 regarding view corridor requirements.  2. On designated view corridors specified in Section 23.49.024, the minimum facade height is the maximum height permitted in the required setback, if it is less than the minimum facade height required in subsection 23.49.056.A.1.

 B. Facade Setback Limits.

 1. Setback Limits for Property Line Facades. The following setback limits apply to all streets designated on Map 1H as requiring property line facades.

 a. The facades of structures 15 feet or less in height shall be located within 2 feet of the street lot line.

 b. Structures greater than 15 feet in height  are  governed by the following criteria:

 1) No setback limits apply up to an elevation of 15 feet above sidewalk grade.

 2) Between the elevations of 15 and 35 feet above sidewalk grade, the facade shall be located within 2 feet of the street lot line, except that:

 a) Any exterior public open space that satisfies the Downtown Amenity Standards, whether it receives a bonus or not, and any outdoor common recreation area required for residential uses, is not considered part of the setback.

 b) Setbacks between the elevations of 15 and 35 feet above sidewalk grade at the street lot line are permitted according to the following standards, as depicted in Exhibit  B for  23.49.056 ((~~B~~)):

 ((~~--~~))  i.  The maximum setback is 10 feet.

 ((~~--~~))  ii.  The total area of a facade that is setback more than 2 feet from the street lot line shall not exceed 40 percent of the total facade area between the elevations of 15 and 35 feet.

 ((~~--~~))  iii.  No setback deeper than 2 feet shall be wider than 20 feet, measured parallel to the street lot line.

 ((~~--~~))  iv.  The facade of the structure shall return to within 2 feet of the street lot line between each setback area for a minimum of 10 feet. Balcony railings and other nonstructural features or walls are not considered the facade of the structure.

 c. If sidewalk widening is required by Section 23.49.022, setback standards shall be measured to the line established by the new sidewalk width rather than the street lot line.

 2. General Setback Limits. The following setback limits apply on streets not requiring property line facades, as shown on Map 1H:

 a. The portion of a structure subject to setback limits shall vary according to the structure height and required minimum facade height, as follows:

 1) Except as provided in subsection 23.49.056.B.2.a.3, if the structure is greater than 15 feet in height, the setback limits apply to the facade between an elevation of 15 feet above sidewalk grade and the minimum facade height established in subsection 23.49.056.A and illustrated in Exhibit  C for  23.49.056 ((~~C~~)).

 2) If the entire structure is 15 feet or less in height, the setback limits apply to the entire street- facing facade.

 3) If the minimum facade height is 15 feet, the setback limits apply to the portion of the street- facing facade that is 15 feet or less in height.

 b. The maximum area of all setbacks between the street lot line and facade along each street frontage of a lot shall not exceed the area derived by multiplying the averaging factor by the width of the street frontage of the structure along that street (see Exhibit  D for  23.49.056 ((~~D~~))). The averaging factor is five on Class I pedestrian streets and ten on Class II pedestrian streets and designated green streets.

 c. The maximum width, measured along the street lot line, of any setback area exceeding a depth of 15 feet from the street lot line shall not exceed 80 feet, or 30 percent of the lot frontage on that street, whichever is less. (See Exhibit  D for  23.49.056 ((~~D~~)).)

 d. The maximum setback of the facade from the street lot lines at intersections is 10 feet. The minimum distance the facade must conform to this limit is 20 feet along each street. (See Exhibit  E for  23.49.056 ((~~E~~)).)

 e. Any exterior public open space that meets the Downtown Amenity Standards, whether it receives a bonus or not, and any outdoor common recreation area required for residential uses, ((~~shall~~)) is  not ((~~be~~)) considered part of a setback. (See Exhibit  C for  23.49.056 ((~~C~~)).)

 f. If a sidewalk is widened into the lot as a condition of development, setback standards shall be measured to the line established by the new sidewalk width rather than the street lot line.

 * * *

 F. Setback and Landscaping Requirements for Lots Located Within the Denny Triangle Urban  Center  Village.

 1. Landscaping in the Street Right-of-Way for All Streets Other Than Those With Green Street Plans Approved by Director's Rule.

Any area under canopies or marquees is considered uncovered. Any setback provided to meet the minimum sidewalk widths established by Section 23.49.022 is exempt from the calculation of the area to be landscaped.

 b. All plant material shall be planted directly in the ground or in permanently installed planters where planting in the ground is not feasible. A minimum of 50 percent of the plant material shall be perennial and shall include trees if a contiguous area, all or a portion of which is landscaped pursuant to subsection 23.49.056.F.1.a, exceeds 600 square feet.

 4. Terry and 9th Avenues Green Street Setbacks.

</table> Footnotes for Table C for Section 23.54.015:  (1) When this use is permitted in a single-family zone as a conditional use, the Director may modify the parking requirements pursuant to Section 23.44.022; when the use is permitted in a multifamily zone as a conditional use, the Director may modify the parking requirements pursuant to Section 23.45.570. The Director, in consultation with the Director of ((~~the Seattle Department of~~)) Transportation, may allow adult care and child care centers locating in existing structures to provide loading and unloading spaces on-street when no other alternative exists.

 (2) The amount of required parking is calculated based on the maximum number of staff, children, or clients that the center is designed to accommodate on site at any one time.

 (3) A child care facility, when co-located with an assisted living facility, may count the passenger load/unload space required for the assisted living facility toward its required passenger load/unload spaces.

 (4) When family support centers are located within community centers owned and operated by  the Department of Parks and Recreation ((~~DOPAR~~)), the Director may lower the combined parking requirement by up to a maximum of 15 percent, pursuant to Section 23.54.020.I.

 (5) Indoor gymnasiums ((~~shall~~)) are  not ((~~be~~)) considered ball courts, nor ((~~shall~~)) are  they ((~~be~~)) considered auditoria or public assembly rooms unless they contain bleachers (fixed seats). If the gymnasium contains bleachers, the parking requirement for the ((~~entire~~)) gymnasium ((~~shall be~~)) is  one parking space for every eight fixed seats. Each 20 inches of width of bleachers ((~~shall be~~)) is  counted as one fixed seat for the purposes of determining parking requirements. If the gymnasium does not contain bleachers and is in a school, there is no parking requirement for the gymnasium. If the gymnasium does not contain bleachers and is in a community center, the parking requirement ((~~shall be~~)) is  one space for each 350 square feet.

 (6) When a library is permitted in a single-family zone as a conditional use, the Director may modify the parking requirements pursuant to Section 23.44.022; when a library is permitted in a multifamily zone as a conditional use, the Director may modify the parking requirements pursuant to Section 23.45.122; and when a library is permitted in a commercial zone, the Director may modify the parking requirements ((~~according~~)) pursuant  to Section 23.44.022.L.

 (7) For public schools, when an auditorium or other place of assembly is demolished and a new one built in its place, parking requirements ((~~shall be~~)) are  determined based on the new construction. When an existing public school on an existing public school site is remodeled, additional parking is required if any auditorium or other place of assembly is expanded or additional fixed seats are added. Additional parking is required as shown on Table ((~~A~~)) C for 23.54.015  for the increase in floor area or increase in number of seats only. If the parking requirement for the increased area or seating is 10 percent or less than that for the existing auditorium or other place of assembly, then no additional parking ((~~shall be~~)) is  required.

 (8) Development standard departures may be granted or required pursuant to the procedures and criteria set forth in Chapter 23.79 to reduce the required or permitted number of parking spaces.

 (9) The general requirement of lines A through O of Table C for Section 23.54.015 for general public uses and institutions, is superseded to the extent that a use, structure or development qualifies for either a greater or a lesser parking requirement (which may include no requirement) under any other provision. To the extent that a general public use or institution fits within more than one line in Table C for Section 23.54.015, the least of the applicable parking requirements applies. The different parking requirements listed for certain categories of general public uses or institutions shall not be construed to create separate uses for purposes of any requirements related to establishing or changing a use under this Title 23.

 A. Land use decisions are classified into five categories based on the amount of discretion and level of impact associated with each decision. Procedures for the five different categories are distinguished according to who makes the decision, the type and amount of public notice required, and whether appeal opportunities are provided. Land use decisions are categorized by type in Table A for 23.76.004.

 B. Type I and II decisions are made by the Director and are consolidated in Master Use Permits. Type I decisions are ((~~non-appealable~~)) decisions made by the Director ((~~which~~)) that  require the exercise of little or no discretion  and that are not appealable to the Hearing Examiner . Type II decisions are discretionary decisions made by the Director ((~~which~~)) that  are subject to an administrative open record appeal hearing to the Hearing Examiner; provided that Type II decisions enumerated in Section 23.76.006 . C . 2 shall be made by the Council when associated with a Council land use decision and are not subject to administrative appeal. Type III decisions are made by the Hearing Examiner after conducting an open record hearing and not subject to administrative appeal.  Type I, II or III decisions may be subject to land use interpretation pursuant to Section 23.88.020.

 C. Type IV and V decisions are Council land use decisions. Type IV decisions are quasi-judicial decisions made by the Council pursuant to existing legislative standards and based upon the Hearing Examiner's record and recommendation. Type V decisions are legislative decisions made by the Council in its capacity to establish policy and manage public lands.

 D. For projects requiring both a Master Use Permit and a Council land use decision as described in this chapter, the Council decision must be made prior to issuance of the Master Use Permit. All conditions established by the Council in its decision shall be incorporated in any subsequently issued Master Use Permit for the project.

 E. Certain land use decisions are subject to additional procedural requirements beyond the standard procedures established in this ((~~c~~)) C hapter  23.76 . ((~~Code references for such additional requirements, where applicable, are provided in Seattle Municipal Code (SMC) Sections 23.76.006 and 23.76.036.~~))  These requirements may be prescribed in the regulations for the zone in which the proposal is located, in other provisions of this title, or in other titles of the Seattle Municipal Code.

 F. Shoreline appeals and appeals of related SEPA determinations shall be filed with the State Shoreline Hearings Board within ((~~twenty-one (~~))21((~~)~~)) days of the receipt of the decision by the Department of Ecology as set forth in RCW 90.58.180.

 G. An applicant for a permit or permits requiring more than one ((~~(1)~~)) decision contained in the land use decision framework listed in Section 23.76.004 may either:

 1. Use the integrated and consolidated process established in this chapter;

 2. If the applicant includes a variance, lot boundary adjustment, or short subdivision approval and no environmental review is required for the proposed project pursuant to SMC Chapter 25.05, ((~~SEPA~~))  Environmental  Policies and Procedures, file a separate Master Use Permit application for the variance, lot boundary adjustment, or short subdivision sought and use the integrated and consolidated process established in this chapter for all other required decisions; or

 3. Proceed with separate applications for each permit decision sought.

 M. Parking.

 1. Policy Background.

 a. Increased parking demand associated with development projects may adversely affect the availability of parking in an area.

 b. Parking regulations to mitigate most parking impacts and to accommodate most of the cumulative effects of future projects on parking are implemented through the City's Land Use Code. However, in some neighborhoods, due to inadequate off-street parking, streets are unable to absorb parking spillover. The City recognizes that the cost of providing additional parking may have an adverse effect on the affordability of housing.

 2. Policies.

 a. It is the City's policy to minimize or prevent adverse parking impacts associated with development projects.

 b. Subject to the overview and cumulative effects policies set forth in Sections 25.05.665 and 25.05.670, the decisionmaker may condition a project to mitigate the effects of development in an area on parking; provided that:

 1) No SEPA authority is provided to mitigate the impact of development on parking availability in the downtown zones;

 2) In Seattle Mixed (SM) zones, and for residential uses located within the Capitol Hill/First Hill Urban Center, the University District Northwest Urban Center Village, and the Station Area Overlay District, no SEPA authority is provided for the decisionmaker to require more parking than the minimum required by the Land Use Code;

 3) Parking impact mitigation for multifamily development, except in the Alki area, as described in subsection 25.05.675.M.2.c below, may be required only where on-street parking is at capacity, as defined by the Seattle Department of Transportation or where the development itself would cause on-street parking to reach capacity as so defined.

 c. For the Alki area, as identified on Map B for ((~~23.45.015~~)) 23.54.015 , a higher number of spaces per unit than is required by ((~~SMC~~)) Section 23.54.015 may be required to mitigate the adverse parking impacts of specific multifamily projects. Projects that generate a greater need for parking and that are located in places where the street cannot absorb that need --- for example, because of proximity to the Alki Beach Park --- may be required to provide additional parking spaces to meet the building's actual need. In determining that need, the size of the development project, the size of the units and the number of bedrooms in the units shall be considered.

 Section 72. This ordinance shall take effect and be in force 30 days from and after its approval by the Mayor, but if not approved and returned by the Mayor within ten days after presentation, it shall take effect as provided by Seattle Municipal Code Section 1.04.020.
