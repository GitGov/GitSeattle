 Section 29. Section 15.04.037 of the Seattle Municipal Code, last amended by Ordinance 118369, is amended as follows:

 15.04.037 Overview of indemnity deposit, accounts, escrow, insurance, and surety bond((~~.~~))

 A. Sections 15.04.040 through 15.04.060 are coordinated elements of a package of protections intended to :  assist the City in collection of expenses charged under ((~~this ordinance~~))  the Street Use Ordinance  and costs associated with a use under  a  permit; ((~~to~~)) assure performance of the requirements of ((~~this ordinance~~))  the Street Use Ordinance  and the covenants or conditions in a permit; ((~~to~~)) place on the ((~~user~~))  permittee  the risks associated with the use and provide a degree of financial responsibility in the event of an accident or injury; ((~~and, when their use is completed, to have~~))  restore the  public place ((~~restored~~))  when the permittee's use has been revoked or terminated  to at least as good a condition ((~~as before the use began~~))  as required by current applicable standards ; and ((~~thereby further compliance and~~)) protect the public treasury. The City's acceptance of an indemnity deposit, an escrow account, a surety bond, or insurance ;  or the establishment of a subaccount in the City Treasury in favor of  an applicant or  a permittee ((~~do~~))  does  not limit  an applicant's or  a permittee's liability to the amount ((~~thereof~~)) deposited or  stated in the instrument .

 B. Sections 15.04.040 through 15.04.060 relate to each other as follows:

 1. A deposit with the City under Section 15.04.040 provides a source of funds, held by the City, to pay probable City expenditures arising from a proposed use ((~~and/or~~))  or restoration of the public place after the use((~~,~~)) ;  the time of City employees for inspection and Code enforcement((~~,~~)) ;  and ancillary City expenses. Annual fees are billed separately.

 2. An escrow account maintained under Section 15.04.042 may be an alternative to a deposit under Section 15.04.040 for amounts at or over ((~~One Thousand Dollars~~~~($1,000) and/or~~))  $1,000; or  to ((~~providing~~))  provide  a surety bond under Section 15.04.044 in an amount up to ((~~Ten Thousand Dollars ($10,000),~~))  $10,000;  or a supplement to either or both of them. ((~~It~~))  An escrow account  differs from a deposit in that the ((~~stakeholder~~))  deposit holder , rather than the City, is a public depository; interest on the deposit accrues to the account, rather than to the City; and withdrawals from the account are governed by the escrow agreement rather than by City rules on guaranty deposits.

 3. A subaccount under Section 15.04.050 establishes a balance with the City in favor of the applicant or permittee against which a City department may deduct fees and charges as they occur, including annual fees and deposits for particular permits.

 4. A surety bond under Section 15.04.044 provides a promise by a licensed surety company, within the limits and according to the terms of the bond, to perform work or pay the City's expenses to perform the work in the event of the permittee's default. A surety bond is not a substitute for providing the City public liability insurance for any tortious injury.

 5. Liability insurance under Section 15.04.045 protects the City as an additional insured from public liability as a result of an accident, injury, or damage arising from the use of a public place((~~,~~)) ;  and assists in making permittees financially responsible for meeting liabilities that may arise from their use of public places.

 6. The covenant for indemnity under Section 15.04.060 holds the City harmless from ((~~any and~~)) all claims, actions,  suits, liability, loss, costs, expense,  or damages  of every kind and description . It applies independently of the foregoing and authorizes a tender of defense by the City to the permittee in  the  event of a  suit, action, or  claim ((~~or lawsuit~~)) arising from the use.

 7. Section 15.04.017 empowers an authorized official, when required to do so by a constitutional provision ,  or state  or federal  law, to waive compliance with any of ((~~these sections~~))  the Sections 15.04.040 through 15.04.060 .

 C. The amount set by an authorizing official for an indemnity deposit, an escrow account ,  or a surety bond((~~,~~)) ;  and the correctness of a charge or deduction shown on the City's account statement or made from an escrow account ;  shall be subject to review or reconsideration ((~~pursuant~~))  according  to ((~~SMC~~)) Section 15.04.112.

 Section 30. Section 15.04.040 of the Seattle Municipal Code, last amended by Ordinance 123361, is amended as follows:

 15.04.040 Indemnity deposit -- Escrow -- Surety bond((~~.~~))

 A. If the authorizing official determines that there is a substantial risk of injury, damage, or expense to the City or probable City expenditures arising from an applicant's proposed use of any public place((~~,~~)) ;  the authorizing official may require the applicant to make an indemnity deposit with the Director of Finance and Administrative Services in an amount based on the official's estimate of the injury, damage ,  or expense to the City ((~~and/or~~)) ; or  cost of ((~~restoration of~~))  restoring  the public place if a mishap or accident ((~~were to occur~~))  occurs . The funds shall be deposited to the credit of the Guaranty Deposit Fund.

 B. The indemnity deposit shall be used to pay the cost of :  restoring the public place((~~,~~)) :  ((~~or~~)) removing any earth or other debris((~~, of~~)) ;  replacing or repairing any  damaged  utility ((~~interrupted~~)) or ((~~damaged or of any~~)) trees in the public place((~~, of~~)) ;  completing any work left unfinished((~~, of~~)) ;  resetting any traffic control devices((~~, of the expenses of~~)) ;  engineering and other studies authorized by Section 15.04.035, and any other expense that the City may sustain in conjunction with the permitted work((~~, plus~~))  and;  a City administrative charge equal to 15((~~-~~)) percent of the amounts expended for the City's expenses for services such as inspections, surveys, preparing plans, letting contracts, and contract administration or supervision. The balance of the cash indemnity deposit, if any, after all deductions shall be returned to the applicant  or permittee . If the indemnity deposit ((~~be~~))  is  insufficient, the applicant  or permittee  shall be liable for the deficiency.

 C. The authorizing official may authorize the filing of a surety bond in accordance with Section 15.04.044 in lieu of making all or part of an indemnity deposit and may suspend its application or waive compliance when required by Section 15.02.027.

 Section 31. Section 15.04.042 of the Seattle Municipal Code, last amended by Ordinance 117569, is amended as follows:

 15.04.042 Escrow((~~.~~))

 An authorizing official may accept the establishment of an escrow account in a qualified public depository as defined in RCW 39.58 that is eligible to receive City moneys ((~~(a)~~)) as a substitute for ((~~making~~)) :

 A. Making  all or part of an indemnity deposit required by Section 15.04.040 if the amount involved equals or exceeds ((~~One Thousand Dollars ($1,000.00)~~))  $1,000  and the terms of the escrow authorize the deduction and payment to the City of charges identified in Section 15.04.040; ((~~and/or (b) as a substitute for filing~~))  or

 B. Filing  a surety bond required by Section 15.04.044 if the amount involved is ((~~Ten Thousand Dollars ($10,000.00)~~))  $10,000  or less((~~,~~)) and, in the event of the applicant's  or permittee's  default, the authorizing official anticipates that the City could reasonably complete the work needed to protect the public and restore the public place for the amount placed in the escrow account.

 C.  Interest accruing in the escrow account shall be added to the principal account and the balance after deductions returned to the applicant  or permittee .

 Section 32. Section 15.04.044 of the Seattle Municipal Code, last amended by Ordinance 123361, is amended as follows:

 15.04.044 Surety bond((~~.~~))

 A.

 B. If the application ((~~shall be~~))  proposes  to construct, reconstruct, repair, maintain, or remove any pavement, sewer, water main, storm drain, grading, street lighting, or appurtenance ((~~thereto~~))  in the public place , the applicant shall file with the Director of Finance and Administrative Services or ((~~such official's~~))  the  functional successor :  a  sufficient  surety bond  executed by a surety company authorized and qualified to do business in the State of Washington and is  approved as to surety and as to form by the City Attorney.
