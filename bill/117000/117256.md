 AN ORDINANCE relating to the Revenue Stabilization Account of the Cumulative Reserve Subfund; revising policies regarding deposits into the Subfund; amending Seattle Municipal Code Subsection 5.80.020 B in connection therewith; and superseding a portion of Resolution 31083.

 WHEREAS, the City's revenue sources are susceptible to sudden unanticipated shortfalls due to a number of factors, including economic downturns, changes in state law governing City revenue, and legal judgments; and

 WHEREAS, sudden downward adjustments to City spending plans mid-way through a fiscal year in response to unanticipated revenue shortfalls can result in significant disruptions to essential City services and operations; and

 WHEREAS, RCW 35.21.070 and Seattle Municipal Code 5.80.010 establish that the Cumulative Reserve Subfund (CRS) may serve as financial reserve to help stabilize revenues; and

 WHEREAS, the Revenue Stabilization Account (RSA) of the CRS was established to support essential City operations during unanticipated shortfalls in the City's revenues; and

 WHEREAS, the RSA was heavily relied upon during 2009 and 2010 to ease the financial impact of the Great Recession of 2008; and

 WHEREAS, the RSA balance is currently low relative to the target for the Account; and

 WHEREAS, new economic realities mean that future revenue growth is likely to be subdued relative to recoveries from past recessions and as a result existing policies for the replenishment of the RSA will not be sufficient to restore the balance in a timely way; and

 WHEREAS, it is a priority of City leaders to replenish the RSA in order to better position the City to weather future economic downturns; and

 WHEREAS, requiring an automatic transfer of tax revenues at the outset of each year provides a predictable and proactive method of filling the RSA; and

 WHEREAS, changing the funding mechanism for the RSA from relying on surplus revenue to relying on surplus fund balance in the General Subfund increases the likelihood of providing adequate resources to the RSA in this new economic climate; and

 WHEREAS, suspending contributions to the RSA when nominal tax revenue growth is negative acknowledges that the City would likely be relying on the RSA in this type of situation; and

 WHEREAS, evaluating out-year financial forecasts is important in determining how much is appropriate to draw down the RSA at any time in order to ensure a sustainable path for the City; and

 WHEREAS, the funding mechanisms for the RSA have not been adjusted since the RSA was first established in 1999 and are currently stated in Policy 10 of the Financial Policies for the City of Seattle Cumulative Reserve Subfund of the General Fund, adopted by the City Council and Mayor under Section 1 of Resolution 31083; and

 WHEREAS, it is appropriate to supersede Policy 10 of the Financial Policies for the City of Seattle Cumulative Reserve Subfund of the General Fund to effectuate the changing of the funding mechanism for the RSA; NOW THEREFORE,

 BE IT ORDAINED BY THE CITY OF SEATTLE AS FOLLOWS:

 Section 1. Subsection 5.80.020.B of the Seattle Municipal Code, which section was last amended by Ordinance 123361, is amended as follows:

 5.80.020 Structure of subfund.

 * * *

 B. The Revenue Stabilization Account shall be used for revenue stabilization for future City operations and to fund activities that would otherwise be reduced in scope, suspended or eliminated due to unanticipated shortfalls in General Subfund revenues . Transfers into and expenditures from the Revenue Stabilization Account shall occur as follows:

 1.  Expenditures from the Revenue Stabilization Account shall require an ordinance((~~passed by two-thirds vote unless state law requires a higher super majority vote of the City Council~~)).  An assessment of the City's long-term financial outlook should be considered when making decisions about how much to expend from the Revenue Stabilization Account, including a projection of how Revenue Stabilization Account resources are expected to be used and at least partially replenished over the following four years .

 2.  The Revenue Stabilization Account shall be funded by  (a)  (~~((1))~~)transfers by ordinance, ((~~and~~)) (b) ((~~(2)~~)) automatic transfer of  0.25 percent of General Subfund  tax revenues forecast for 2012 and the automatic transfer of 0.50 percent of forecast General Subfund tax revenues for each year thereafter, and (c) ((~~to the extent described in this section. U~~)) u pon completion of fiscal year accounting,  automatic transfer of 50 percent of the ending General Subfund fund balance, less encumbrances, carryforwards as authorized by ordinance or state law, and planned reserve amounts reflected in the adopted budget, ((~~tax revenues collected during the closed fiscal year~~~~which~~~~are~~)) that is  in excess of the latest revised estimate of  the unreserved ending fund balance ((~~tax revenues~~))for that closed fiscal year (as published in the ((~~current fiscal year~~))adopted budget)((~~shall automatically be deposited to the Revenue Stabilization Account~~)). ((~~Such deposit~~)) A transfer as described in subsection 5.80.020.B.2.c  shall occur at that time the City completes its accounting for the  closed fiscal year. ((~~At no time shall the balance of the Revenue Stabilization Account exceed 5-percent of the amount of tax revenues received by the City during the fiscal year prior to the closed fiscal year.~~))

 3. For purposes of  this subsection 5.80.020.B  ((~~this paragraph~~)), the phrase "tax revenues" means all tax revenues deposited into the General Subfund, including but not limited to, tax revenue from the regular property tax levy, business and occupation tax, utility business taxes,  the portion of admissions tax not dedicated to the Arts Account , leasehold excise tax, gambling taxes, and sales and use taxes.

 4. At no time shall the balance of the Revenue Stabilization Account exceed 5 percent of the  General Subfund tax revenues forecast underlying the adopted budget for the current fiscal year. Automatic transfers of funds into the Revenue Stabilization Account as required by subsection 5.80.020.B.2 shall be made only to the extent that the fund balance for the Revenue Stabilization Account does not exceed 5 percent of the tax revenues forecast for the current fiscal year, and the automatic transfer of any amount that would result in such an excess shall be suspended.

 5. When the Revenue Stabilization Account balance reaches 5 percent of forecast tax revenues, and automatic transfers are suspended, the amount that would have been automatically transferred into the Revenue Stabilization Account had the Revenue Stabilization Account not reached its maximum-allowed fund balance should be used to pay for existing obligations rather than to fund new programs.

 6. The transfer of 0.50 percent of General Subfund tax revenues and 50 percent of General Subfund year-end balances that is described in subsection 5.80.020.B.2 shall be temporarily suspended when revenue forecasts underlying the adopted budget anticipate a nominal decline in General Subfund revenues, as compared to the revenue forecasts underlying the adopted budget for the fiscal year immediately prior. Automatic transfers shall remain suspended until positive revenue growth is reflected in the revenue forecasts underlying the adopted budget.

 7. In the first year during which positive revenue growth is again forecast, the automatic transfer of tax revenues described in subsection 5.80.020.B.2.b shall be limited to 0.25 percent, followed by an automatic transfer of 0.50 percent in each year thereafter, unless the City again forecasts a nominal decline in General Subfund tax revenues or the value of the Revenue Stabilization Account reaches 5 percent of forecast tax revenues.

 8. The automatic transfer of 0.25 percent or 0.50 percent of General Subfund tax revenues that is described in subsections 5.80.020.B.2.b and 5.80.020.B.7 shall also be temporarily suspended in any year that an expenditure from the Revenue Stabilization Account is authorized in the adopted budget.

 Section 2. Policy 10 of the Financial Policies for the City of Seattle Cumulative Reserve Subfund of the General Fund, adopted by the City Council and Mayor under Section 1 of Resolution 31083, and attached as Exhibit A thereto, is superseded by this ordinance.

 Section 3. This ordinance shall take effect and be in force 30 days after its approval by the Mayor, but if not approved and returned by the Mayor within ten days after presentation, it shall take effect as provided by Seattle Municipal Code Section 1.04.020.
