 AN ORDINANCE relating to the rates, terms and conditions for the use and sale of electricity supplied by the City Light Department; and amending Seattle Municipal Code Chapter 21.49 in connection therewith.

 WHEREAS, Resolution 31187, adopted by the City Council on March 22, 2010, established financial policies including the rate setting guideline of setting electric rates at levels sufficient to achieve a debt service coverage ratio of 1.8; and

 WHEREAS, Ordinance 123260, adopted by the City Council on March 22, 2010, established the Rate Stabilization Account to absorb fluctuations in City Light's annual revenue in any given year due to deviations in net wholesale revenue from the amount assumed in the adopted budget for that year; and

 WHEREAS, Ordinance 120247, passed by the City Council on January 29, 2001, established an automatic BPA pass- through cost adjustment, which was reaffirmed and amended most recently in Ordinance 122282, passed by the City Council on November 20, 2006; and

 WHEREAS, in August 2009 BPA announced changes for two years effective October 1 in the years 2010 and 2011, which produces a pass-through adjustment of 0.03 cents per kWh for 2010 and 0.12 cents per kWh for 2011, which is automatically added to the kilowatt-hour charges in all rate schedules that include energy charges per kilowatt- hour, except that 40 percent of these increases are added to the energy charges of residential rate assistance schedules in accordance with SMC 21.49.081; and

 WHEREAS, Ordinance 122282, passed by the City Council on November 20, 2006, established comprehensive rates, terms, and conditions for the use and sale of electricity supplied by City Light; and

 WHEREAS, the City Council has reviewed City Light's costs of providing electric service and has determined that they have increased beyond the level that can be sustained by the rates currently in effect; and

 WHEREAS, the City Council has determined that the required rate increase should be implemented on January 1, 2011, in the form of an across-the-board increase of 4.3 percent, and be followed by an additional rate increase on January 1, 2012, in the form of another across-the- board increase of 3.2% percent; and

 WHEREAS, the across-the-board increases will apply beginning on January 1, 2011, to all rate elements of rate schedules, except Duct, Vault and Pole Rental Rates, which are revised based directly on cost of service and to certain undergrounding charges which are not increased; and

 WHEREAS, Ordinance 123256, passed by the City Council on March 22, 2010, established the City Light Review Panel to review changes to City Light's rates not already authorized by the Seattle Municipal Code and provide an opinion to the Mayor and the Council on the adequacy and prudence of such rate changes in light of adopted planning assumptions and financial policies; and

 WHEREAS, community solar is a growing movement nationally and regionally which removes some of the significant barriers to solar energy use such as high entry cost, home ownership, and access to solar resources; and

 WHEREAS, a growing number of City Light customers are expressing interest in participating in community solar projects; and

 WHEREAS, City Light received a grant award of $300,000 in 2010 from the US Department of Energy Solar Market Transformation Program for the development of a utility- owned and managed Community Solar Program; and

 WHEREAS, RCW 82.16.110 -- 82.16.140 establishes a Renewable Energy System Cost Recovery program for Washington State that includes utility-owned community solar projects, defined as: A utility-owned solar energy system located in Washington state that is capable of generating up to seventy-five kilowatts of electricity and that is voluntarily funded by the utility's ratepayers where, in exchange for their financial support, the utility gives contributors a payment or credit on their utility bill for their share of the value of the electricity generated by the solar energy system; and

 WHEREAS, City Light has determined that in order to credit Community Solar Program participants for the electricity produced, a single rate shall be used; and

 WHEREAS, the City Council has reviewed the rates, terms, and conditions set forth within this Ordinance, has determined they are consistent with the financial policies supported by the Council, and believes they will continue to provide the users of electric service supplied by the City of Seattle efficient electric service at low cost; NOW THEREFORE,

 Section 9. Section 21.49.080 of the Seattle Municipal Code is amended to read as follows:

 21.49.080 Power factor rate (Schedule PF)

 A. When any inductive load causes unsatisfactory conditions on the Department's system due to induction, the Department may, at its discretion, install reactive kVA-hour meters and make a monthly charge in addition to demand and energy charges whenever electricity delivered to the customer has an average monthly power factor of less than 0.97.

 RATE EFFECTIVE JANUARY 1, 2010

 Schedule PF (Power Factor)

 The monthly charge for average monthly power factors below 0.97 shall be as follows:

 0.14 cent per kVarh

 RATE EFFECTIVE JANUARY 1, 2011

 Schedule PF (Power Factor)

 The monthly charge for average monthly power factors below 0.97 shall be as follows:

 0.15 cent per kVarh

 RATE EFFECTIVE JANUARY 1, 2012:

 The monthly charge for average monthly power factors below 0.97 shall be as follows:

 0.15 cent per kVarh

 B. Unless specifically otherwise agreed, the Department shall not be obligated to deliver electricity to the customer at any time at a power factor below 0.85.

 C. The average power factor is determined as follows:

 For application of the Power Factor Rate, the Average Power Factor calculated with this formula will not be rounded.

 D. The meter for measurement of reactive kVA hours shall be ratcheted to prevent reverse registration.

 E. All installations of power factor corrective equipment shall be subject to the approval of the Department. The customer's corrective equipment shall be switched with the load so that at no time will it supply leading reactive kVAs to the Department's distribution system unless written Department approval is obtained to do so.

 F. This monthly charge may be waived in whole or in part to the extent that the Department determines that a power factor of less than 0.97 would be advantageous to the Department or if the addition of corrective equipment would be detrimental to the operation of the Department's distribution systems.

 G. Customers who install new or enlarged arc furnaces shall install static VAR generators for flicker control and power factor correction for the entire arc furnace load. The generators shall have ((~~one-half (~~)) 1/2 ((~~)))~~ cycle response time and independent phase control, supply sufficient reactive power to prevent objectionable flicker at the common connection point of the arc furnace with other utility customers, maintain a minimum power factor of 0.97, and be filtered to limit the total harmonic current to no more than the percentage of fundamental current given in "IEEE Recommended Practices and Requirements for Harmonic Control in Electric Power Systems, IEEE-519," latest revision.

 Section 10. Section 21.49.081 of the Seattle Municipal Code is amended to read as follows:

 21.49.081 Automatic BPA Cost Adjustment

 Each time that BPA adjusts its rates ((~~from those in~~)) that are applied to City Light through  its ((~~block and slice~~))then current power sales agreements (PSAs) with ((~~City Light~~)) BPA(( ~~effective as of January 1, 2007~~)), City Light will calculate the difference (in dollars) between what City Light would have paid for its BPA purchases under the PSAs for a ((~~twelve (~~))12((~~)~~)) month period beginning on the effective date of the BPA adjustment and what City Light will actually pay for the same period under the adjusted BPA rates. The dollar difference will then be multiplied by 1.1095, which is the effective tax rate, and the product divided by forecast load (in kWh) over the ((~~twelve (~~))12((~~)~~)) month period to calculate a number (in dollars/kWh rounded to the nearest ten thousandth of a dollar) which will be called the "BPA increment."

 For example, if an increase in BPA PSA rates results in increased costs to the Department of$18,422,543 per year, this amount would be multiplied by the 1.1095 effective tax rate to get required additional customer revenue of $20,439,811. The additional revenue required would then be divided by the forecast kWh load to calculate the BPA increment.

 As soon as practical after a BPA adjustment in PSA rates, energy charges in effect under all rate schedules will be increased or decreased by the BPA increment, provided that for customers served under Schedules REC, RLC, RET, RLT, RES, RLS, REH, RLH, REB andRLB, energy charges shall be increased or decreased by ((~~forty~~))  40  percent ((~~(40%)~~)) of the BPA increment. The BPA increment will increase or decrease equally first block and second block charges in residential rates and peak and off-peak rates for large and high demand general service customers as well as the single energy charges for small and medium general service customers and the energy charge portion of Schedules T, P and F.

 If at any time after December 31, 2006 ,  BPA announces an adjustment in the rates to be charged under the PSAs to City Light, then City Light shall compute the BPA increment for the purpose of ensuring that only the increase or decrease in costs under the PSA will be passed through to City Light's customers. The increment will be based on the projected load for a ((~~twelve ())~~12((~~)~~)) month period. City Light's rates shall be adjusted to give effect to the BPA increment, and the adjusted rates shall take effect after the effective date of the adjusted BPA rates as soon as the billing process can be implemented.

 Section 11. Section 21.49.085 of the Seattle Municipal Code is amended to read as follows:

 21.49.085 Reserved distribution capacity charge (Schedule RDC).

 A. Non-residential customers located in areas of the Department's service territory where there is adequate distribution capacity may request that the Department reserve capacity sufficient to meet their loads on a circuit which is different from their normal service circuit. Such customers shall pay a reserved distribution capacity charge.

 Schedule RDC (Reserved Distribution Capacity), effective January 1, 2007

 $0.23 per kW of monthly maximum demand

 Schedule RDC (Reserved Distribution Capacity), effective January 1, 2011

 $0.24 per kW of monthly maximum demand

 Schedule RDC (Reserved Distribution Capacity), effective January 1, 2012

 $0.25 per kW of monthly maximum demand

 B. The acceptance and continued implementation of a customer's request for reserved distribution capacity shall always be contingent on the Department's sole determination that adequate distribution capacity is available.

 Section 12. Chapter 21.49 of the Seattle Municipal Code is amended to add a new section, 21.49.087, to read as follows:

 21.49.087 Community Solar Program

 A.  The Community Solar Program allows customers to receive credits based on energy production from a solar photovoltaic (PV) array owned and managed by Seattle City Light.

 B.  The Community Solar Program shall be voluntary and available to all customers on a first-come, first- served basis beginning in 2011. Interested customers will initiate their participation with a voluntary one- time upfront payment and signed participant contract.

 C.  Each participating customer will receive an energy credit for each kWh produced by their portion of their assigned solar PV array, to be distributed annually as specified in a standard participant contract developed by the Department.

 D.  The credit for kWh produced by community solar PV arrays shall be equal to Seattle City Light's small general service energy charge for the City of Seattle (Schedule SMC) for all community solar participants, regardless of the rate schedule they fall under themselves.

 E.  Each participating customer will also receive annual renewable energy production incentive payments in accordance with RCW 82.16.110, as available through June, 2020.

 F.  The first community solar array owned by Seattle City Light will initially be funded by a Department of Energy grant of $300,000. The voluntary Community Solar Program payments (enrollment fees) will replace some or all of the grant funding, and will be used to finance additional arrays in the same manner.

 G.  Seattle City Light has the right to terminate enrollment of new customers into the program at any time, but will meet obligations to participating customers through the term of their contracts .

 H.  Terms and conditions of the program will be developed by City Light and made available to program participants prior to their enrollment .

 Section 13. This ordinance shall take effect and be in force 30 days from and after its approval by the Mayor, but if not approved and returned by the Mayor within ten days after presentation, it shall take effect as provided by Seattle Municipal Code Section 1.04.020.

 Passed by the City Council the ____ day of _________, 2010, and signed by me in open session in authentication of its passage this _____ day of __________, 2010.
