 Standard Billing Rates for Utility Cut Repairs Which Do Not Require Backfill

 Explanatory Notes:

 * A $132.00 additional charge will be added when extra traffic control signing is required on principal and minor arterials and in the Central Business District. Reference the City of Seattle Traffic Control Manual for In-Street Work, August 1, 1994.

 * If the Seattle Department of Transportation crews have to T-cut a utility cut, a $265.00 charge will be added to the total cost of the repair. (A T-cut removes (peels back) asphalt overlay from a rigid base beyond the edge of the street opening; the width of the T-cut is 12 inches.) Reference Street and Sidewalk Pavement Opening and Restoration Rules (Director's Rule SDOT 2004-02) section 7.4.2.

 * A $374.00 surcharge will be billed to the permittee/contractor if there is a failure of the temporary utility cut patches due to base settlement before the cuts are permanently repaired. Reference Street and Sidewalk Pavement Opening and Restoration Rules (Director's Rule SDOT 2004-02) section 4.3.1.

 * If the asphalt depth is greater than 3 inches, the rate charge per cut will be the over 3" to 6", or greater than 6" asphalt depth rates.

 * As directed in the Pavement Opening and Restoration Rule, some utility cuts may have to be expanded as part of the permanent repair.
