 Together with the vacated portion of Willow Street (now East Cherry Street) adjoining said Lot 12;

 Also together with the vacated portion of 11th Avenue, adjoining the east margin of the above-described property.

 2.  Term.  The permission ((~~herein~~)) granted to the Permittee((~~, its successors and assigns shall be~~))  is  for a term of ten ((~~(10)~~)) years, ((~~commencing~~))  starting  on the effective date of this ordinance and ((~~terminating~~))  ending  at 11:59 p.m. on the last day of the tenth year((~~; provided, however, that upon~~)) . Upon  written application of the Permittee at least ((~~thirty (30)~~))  180  days before expiration of the term, the Director ((~~of Transportation ("Director")~~))  or the City Council  may renew the permit ((~~for two (2)~~))  twice, each time for a  successive ten ((~~(10)~~)) - year ((~~terms, provided further that the total term of the permission as originally granted and thus extended shall not exceed thirty (30) years~~))  term , subject to the right of ((~~The~~))  the  City ((~~of Seattle ("City")~~))  to require the removal of the skybridge or to revise  by ordinance ((~~to then revise~~)) any of the terms and conditions ((~~contained herein~~))  of the permission granted by this ordinance. The total term of the permission, including renewals, shall not exceed 30 years. The Permittee shall submit any application for a new permission no later than 180 days prior to the expiration of the then-existing term.

 3.  Protection of utilities.  The permission  granted  is ((~~hereby~~)) subject to  the Permittee bearing the expense of  any protection, support ,  or relocation of existing utilities deemed necessary by the ((~~owner~~))  owners  of the ((~~utility and shall be done at Permittee's expense with~~))  utilities, and  the Permittee being responsible for any ((~~subsequent~~)) damage to the utilities due to  the  construction , repair, reconstruction, maintenance, operation, or removal  of the ((~~pedestrian~~)) skybridge  and for any consequential damages that may result from any damage to utilities or interruption in service caused by any of the foregoing .

 4.  Removal for public use or for cause.  The ((~~permit~~))  permission  granted ((~~hereby~~)) is subject to ((~~primary and secondary~~)) use  of the street right-of-way or other public place (collectively public place)  by the  City and the  public for travel ((~~and~~)) ,  utility purposes, ((~~and the~~))  and other public uses or benefits. The  City expressly reserves the right to  deny renewal, or terminate the permission at any time prior to expiration of the initial term or any renewal term; and  require the Permittee to remove the ((~~pedestrian~~)) skybridge , or any part thereof or installation on the public place  at  the  Permittee's sole cost and expense in the event that:

 (a) the City Council determines((~~,~~)) by ordinance((~~,~~)) that the space occupied by the ((~~pedestrian~~)) skybridge is necessary for any ((~~primary and secondary~~)) public use or benefit((~~,~~)) or that the ((~~pedestrian~~)) skybridge interferes with any ((~~primary and secondary~~)) public use or benefit; or

 A City Council determination that the space is ((~~necessary~~))  needed  for , or the skybridge interferes with,  a ((~~primary and secondary~~)) public use or benefit ((~~shall be~~))  is  conclusive and final  without any right of the Permittee to resort to the courts to adjudicate the matter .

 5.  Permittee's obligation to remove and restore.

 Failure to remove the skybridge as required by this section is a violation of Chapter 15.90 of the Seattle Municipal Code (SMC) or successor provision; however, applicability of Chapter 15.90 does not eliminate any remedies available to the City under this ordinance or any other authority. If the Permittee does not timely fulfill its obligations under this section, the City may in its sole discretion remove the skybridge and restore the public place at the Permittee's expense, and collect the expenses in any manner provided by law.

 7.  Failure to correct unsafe condition.  After  written  notice to the Permittee((~~,~~)) and failure of the Permittee to correct ((~~said~~))  an  unsafe ((~~or risk prone~~)) condition within the time stated in ((~~such~~))  the  notice, the Director may order the ((~~pedestrian~~)) skybridge  be  closed  or removed at the Permittee's expense  if the Director deems that ((~~it~~))  the skybridge  has become unsafe or creates a risk of injury to the public. ((~~In a situation in which~~))  If  there is an immediate threat to the health or safety of the public,  a  notice  to correct  is not required.

 8.  Continuing obligations.  ((~~Not withstanding~~))  Notwithstanding  termination or expiration of the permission granted, or closure or removal of the ((~~pedestrian~~)) skybridge, the Permittee shall remain bound by  all of  its ((~~obligation~~))  obligations  under this ordinance until((~~:~~
