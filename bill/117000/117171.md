 AN ORDINANCE establishing an Audit Committee to give guidance to, and be a resource for, the City Auditor; stating the committee's purpose and duties, and establishing its membership; enacting new Sections 3.40.100, 3.40.110, and 3.40.120 of the Seattle Municipal Code; and providing that the Audit Committee shall terminate automatically unless provided otherwise by ordinance.

 WHEREAS, the position of City Auditor is created by the Seattle City Charter, article VIII, section 2; and

 WHEREAS, the Office of City Auditor is part of the legislative branch of government, and focuses in large part on performance audits of City departments and functions with a mission to "help the City of Seattle achieve honest, efficient management and full accountability throughout City government"; and

 WHEREAS, the City Council wants the Office of City Auditor to be forward-thinking and innovative; to help bring about more open, accountable, performance-driven, and results- oriented government; to be insulated from political pressures and influences; and to provide an independent opinion on the performance of City departments and programs; and

 WHEREAS, one strategy to help strengthen the Office of City Auditor and promote the City Auditor's independence is to provide a group of advisors who can give guidance to, and be a resource for, the City Auditor; and

 WHEREAS, the City Council has decided to establish an Audit Committee to perform these functions for a trial period of three years, with the intent that if the Audit Committee is successful and proves to be a valuable resource, the City Council will act by ordinance to extend the life of the Audit Committee; NOW, THEREFORE,

 BE IT ORDAINED BY THE CITY OF SEATTLE AS FOLLOWS:

 Section 1. New Sections 3.40.100, 3.40.110, and 3.40.120 of the Seattle Municipal Code are added as follows:

 SMC 3.40.100 Audit Committee established -- Purpose and Duties

 There is established an Audit Committee to give guidance to, and be a resource for, the City Auditor. The Audit Committee is only advisory. The duties of the Audit Committee include the following:

 A. Be a sounding board and resource for, and counsel and give guidance to, the Office of City Auditor;

 B. Help maintain the City Auditor's independence from the City Council and the Mayor;

 C. Review and comment on the City Auditor's work program. The City Auditor retains authority to make the final decisions regarding the content of the work program, to decide when and how frequently to revise the work program, and to conduct any audit;

 D. Monitor the City Auditor's audit results, and monitor follow-up activity by departments to implement audit recommendations;

 E. If desired, comment on the annual report that the City Auditor makes to the Mayor and the City Council under the City Charter, article XXII, section 12 (Annual Reports of Department Heads);

 F. Review the written report from the every-three- years peer review of the Office of City Auditor;

 G. When nearing the end of the term of the City Auditor, review and provide input to the City Council regarding reappointing the Auditor. Input from the Audit Committee will be just one source of information that the City Council will use in deciding whether to reappoint the Auditor;

 H. If requested by the City Council when it is seeking a new City Auditor, recruit, evaluate, and/or screen candidates, and/or make a recommendation to the City Council for appointment of a new City Auditor; and

 I. If requested by the City Council, provide input to the Council as to suggested contents of an "expectations" letter that would be included in the appointment Clerk File when the Auditor is appointed or reappointed.

 SMC 3.40.110 Audit Committee -- Membership

 A. The Audit Committee consists of five members: the City Councilmember who chairs the City Council standing committee with oversight responsibility for the City Auditor; one representative of the Executive branch, appointed by the Mayor subject to confirmation by the City Council; and three public members, none of whom is a current City employee. One of the public members shall be appointed by the Mayor subject to confirmation by the City Council, and two of the public members shall be appointed by the City Council. The appointing authorities for the public members shall consider candidates who have relevant expertise (e.g., program evaluation, law, specialized quantitative analysis), relevant experience (e.g., government or private sector performance audit experience), or other relevant skills.

 B. The term of membership on the Audit Committee is two years, and a member may serve a maximum of two full terms, not counting any portion of a preceding member's unexpired term; except that the term of membership on the Audit Committee for the City Councilmember who is a member of the Audit Committee shall last as long as that person chairs the City Council standing committee with oversight responsibility for the City Auditor. To achieve staggered terms, for the first term for initial members of the Audit Committee, the representative of the Executive branch and one of the Council- appointed public members shall be appointed to two-year terms, and the second Council-appointed public member and the Mayor- appointed public member shall be appointed to three-year terms. At the expiration of a member's term, the member shall serve until his or her replacement is appointed and, if required, confirmed.

 C. When a vacancy occurs, the appointing authority who appointed the member most recently filling that position shall appoint a new member to fill the vacancy. If a vacancy occurs during a term, the new appointee shall serve the remainder of the preceding member's unexpired term.

 D. An Audit Committee member who misses three consecutive meetings is automatically removed from the committee.

 E. Public members serve without compensation for their membership on the Audit Committee.

 F. Each member of the Audit Committee shall comply with the City Code of Ethics applicable to advisory committees.

 G. The City Councilmember who is a member of the Audit Committee is the chair of the Audit Committee.

 SMC 3.40.120 Audit Committee -- Meetings

 A. The Audit Committee shall meet at least twice a year, or more frequently as needed and as called by the chair.

 B. A quorum of the Audit Committee to convene a meeting is three members.

 C. Meetings of the Audit Committee are open to the public, unless an executive session is called pursuant to the state Open Public Meetings Act, RCW chapter 42.30.

 D. Staff support for the Audit Committee is provided by the Legislative Assistant(s) to the chair of the committee, or as the chair otherwise arranges.

 Section 2. Termination of Audit Committee and Repeal of SMC Sections. The Audit Committee shall terminate automatically on June 30, 2014, and Sections 3.40.100, 3.40.110, and 3.40.120 of the Seattle Municipal Code shall be repealed automatically on June 30, 2014, unless the City Council by ordinance amends this provision.

 Section 3. This ordinance shall take effect and be in force 30 days after its approval by the Mayor, but if not approved and returned by the Mayor within ten days after presentation, it shall take effect as provided by Seattle Municipal Code Section 1.04.020.
