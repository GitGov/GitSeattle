 WHEREAS, through this Agreement, the County and the City aim to strengthen public health in Seattle and throughout King County in order to create the conditions that improve the health of all communities, eliminate health inequities and maximize the number of healthy years lived by each person;

 WHEREAS, the 21st Century health challenges faced by residents, neighborhoods and communities throughout the city of Seattle and the county can be most effectively addressed through the coordinated action of multiple jurisdictions and of multiple departments within each jurisdiction;

 WHEREAS, the County and the City choose to establish an Interlocal Agreement that complements the existing governance structures outlined in chap. 70.05 RCW and RCW 70.08.010; and

 WHEREAS, the County and the City desire to establish communication, oversight and accountability mechanisms for the County and the City to address issues concerning said Agreement;

 NOW THEREFORE,

 Pursuant to RCW 70.08.010 and RCW 39.34.080, the County and City agree as follows:

 Section 1. PRINCIPLES OF OPERATION: The County and City wish to ensure that overall Department policy is responsive to community health needs, promotes health equity and creates healthy conditions for all communities. The County has ultimate policy and statutory responsibility for the delivery of public health services throughout the county, including in the city. The City has fiduciary and policy responsibility over its own financial contribution and strong advisory influence on overall policies of the Department that impact public health activities in Seattle. The City's financial contributions to the operation of the Department are voluntary and shall be used to enhance services to its residents and neighborhoods.

 Section 2. ESTABLISHMENT OF DEPARTMENT: As of January 1, 1981, there was established a combined City and County Health Department to be known as the "Seattle- King County Department of Public Health" and that is now known as "Public Health -- Seattle & King County".

 Section 3. DEPARTMENT'S PURPOSE: The Department shall be responsible for the assessment, protection and promotion of health of all county residents, including residents in the city, working to eliminate health inequities and promote equity, and providing services that help to assure access to high quality health care for all populations. The director of the Department shall also have all powers and duties as provided in RCW 70.05.070, including enforcement of public health statutes of the State, rules of the State Board of Health and the Secretary of State, and rules and regulations of the King County Board of Health.

 Section 4. POLICY DEVELOPMENT AND IMPLEMENTATION:

 (a) The King County Board of Health exercises policy influence over the Department pursuant to the powers granted to it in chapter 70.05 RCW. This Agreement seeks to reinforce the role of the Board of Health. The Board of Health is presently a federated body that includes members from the King County Council , elected officials of the City of Seattle, elected officials of cities and towns of King County other than Seattle, and health professionals, as provided in chap. 2.35 King County Code.

 (d) In addition to directing the use of its own funds, the City shall have the opportunity to advise and participate in formulating health policies that impact its residents and neighborhoods. Likewise, the County and the Department shall have the opportunity to advise the City on the programmatic priorities of the City's funding of the Department. The Department Director is responsible for creating appropriate opportunities for City and County participation in policy development and in setting programmatic policies and direction. Furthermore, the Mayor and City Council shall designate a lead City health policy advisor, to be funded by the City, to help facilitate City participation in Department policy development relevant to the City.

 (e) The policies and activities of many County and City departments have a significant impact on the public's health. The Executive and the Mayor shall invite the Department to work with other County and City departments in formulating and implementing policies that promote health equity and the health of county residents and communities, including those in the city of Seattle.

 (f) In recognition of the interrelationship of policies and programs that affect the health of the public in King County and Seattle, both governments shall provide early notification to each other of such policy changes in order to allow for sufficient time for joint discussion and the effective operation of the Department. The Executive, the Mayor and the Department Director shall establish opportunities for each party to influence the policies of the other and to ensure that the Department is responsive to the public health issues and priorities of the County and the City.

 (g) The Executive shall arrange an annual meeting with the Mayor to which the Board of Health Chair and the Department Director will be invited. The purposes of the meeting include a check-in on the implementation of this Agreement, discussion of the public health priorities of each jurisdiction, establishing the key public health priorities and expectations that the County and City have for the Department, and identification of public health policy objectives to be pursued at the regional, state and national levels.

 Section 5. DEPARTMENT'S MANAGEMENT: It is the intent of the parties to retain a joint City-County Health Department in accordance with chapters 70.05 and 70.08 RCW. Accordingly:

 (b) The administration of the Department shall be a function of the County.

 (c) The overall responsibility for financing regional 'core' services of the Department as identified in statute or by the County, such as in the Public Health Operational Master Plan, shall rest with the County.

 (e) The Director shall actively participate in cabinet meetings and activities of both the City and County as directed by the Mayor and County Executive respectively. Department staff shall participate, as appropriate and within available resources, on City and County subcabinets, interdepartmental teams, and key initiatives, as well as work with other City and County departments to create the policies and conditions for healthy communities.

 (f) The Director shall assign staff to participate in the County and City's emergency preparedness and response efforts and provide a presence at their Emergency Operations Centers.

 (g) The Department's name shall reflect joint participation of the City and County.

 Section 6. DEPARTMENT'S ACCOUNTABILITY:

 (a) Since the Department is a County- administered department, the Department Director shall comply with reporting and accountability mechanisms established by the County Executive and County Council.

 (b) The City, in consultation with the Department Director, may establish accountability mechanisms as appropriate related to the City's funding and objectives. The lead City health policy advisor shall help ensure appropriate accountability for the Department's use of City funds and compliance with the terms of this Agreement.

 (c) The Department shall provide timely response to data and information requests from the County Executive, County Council, Mayor and City Council.

 (d) In consultation with the Department, the City shall establish accountability mechanisms for the City's funding of enhanced public health services. Such mechanisms may include specified outcomes and performance commitments.

 Section 8. DEPARTMENT'S FINANCING:

 (a) The County shall be financially responsible for the funding of core public health services throughout the county, including in the city of Seattle.

 (b) The City's financial contributions are voluntary and shall be used to enhance services for its residents and neighborhoods. The City may also voluntarily contribute some funding to support the Department's unique activities that it provides to the City that are typically and routinely more than what it provides to other cities in King County. Examples of such activities include participation on the Mayor's cabinet, subcabinets, emergency preparedness and response efforts, collaboration and policy development with other City departments, and interdepartmental initiatives. The amount of City funding shall be determined in the City budget process, recognizing that the level of the Department's participation in City government may depend, in part, on the amount of support the City provides.

 (c) The County, the City, and the Department shall ensure that contributions to the Department shall result in appropriate use and accountability of funds throughout the county and the city. Furthermore, the County and the Department shall ensure that the City's contributions to the Department shall be used only for their intended purposes and not subsidize expenses for other purposes.

 (d) As part of its contributions to the Department for enhanced health services, the City voluntarily funds primary care medical, dental and health-access services provided by Seattle's community health centers and the Department. The lead City health policy advisor shall represent the City in Department- or County-led community health system/health safety net planning efforts to improve quality and access, and to plan for the implementation of health care reform.
