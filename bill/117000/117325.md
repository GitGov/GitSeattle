 WHEREAS, the Concessionaire submitted a proposal in response to the City's request; and

 WHEREAS, the panel evaluating the proposals selected the Concessionaire's proposal as most advantageous to the City; and

 WHEREAS, the Superintendent determined that the Concessionaire best demonstrated the capability and desire to fulfill the requirements and conditions of this Agreement;

 THEREFORE, IT IS HEREBY AGREED AS FOLLOWS:

 I. GRANT.

 DPR grants to the Concessionaire the exclusive right to offer Vending Products on DPR's property in the locations listed in Exhibit A to this Agreement. DPR reserves to itself the right to offer or to grant any third party the right to offer Vending Products in locations that are not listed on Exhibit A. DPR reserves the right to cancel and remove any locations listed in Exhibit A by sending written notice to the Concessionaire thirty days in advance of cancellation.

 II. TERM AND EARLY TERMINATION.

 This Agreement shall commence on September 1, 2011, and shall terminate at 11:59 pm on August 31, 2016. This agreement may be extended for an additional five- year term at the option of the Superintendent. If the Superintendent decides to exercise the option to extend, then the Superintendent or an assigned designee shall send a written notice to the Concessionaire of the intent to extend the term of the Agreement at least thirty days prior to the termination date of the Agreement. This Agreement may be terminated during this term by either party at any time by giving sixty days written notice to the other party.

 III. CONCESSIONAIRE RESPONSIBILITIES.

 A. PERFORMANCE DEPOSIT.

 At all times during this Agreement, the Concessionaire shall maintain a performance bond in the amount of $20,000.00 or shall make a $20,000.00 cash deposit with DPR by cashier's check. The deposit or bond shall remain in effect throughout the term of this contract and for three months thereafter unless DPR notifies the Concessionaire in writing that this requirement has been eliminated. The bond or deposit will not be released by DPR until the Concessionaire has satisfactorily discharged all duties, responsibilities, and performances under the Agreement.

 Should the Concessionaire fail to fulfill its obligations contained in this Agreement, then DPR may retain the Concessionaire's performance deposit and apply all or some of the deposit to any money owed by Concessionaire or use some or all of the Deposit to remedy Concessionaire's default. The retention of the deposit or any claim against the bond shall not limit the Concessionaire's financial responsibility for default nor limit DPR's right of recovery against the Concessionaire.

 B. HEALTHY MENU OFFERINGS.

 The Concessionaire shall at all times stock all vending machines exclusively with health conscious food selections that meet the "Healthiest and/or Healthier" product selections criteria referenced in Exhibit B. The Concessionaire shall not stock any vending machines with products that do not meet the "Healthiest and/or Healthier" product selections criteria referenced in Exhibit B.

 The Concessionaire shall initially install vending machines at the DPR facilities listed in Exhibit A - Vending Locations. The type and number of vending machines shall be as described in the Concessionaire's proposal attached as Exhibit C (the "Proposal"). The locations of all vending machines on the Premises must be approved in advance by the Superintendent or the Superintendent's designee.

All personal property and machines of the Concessionaire that are placed on the Premises are at the Concessionaire's sole risk. Concessionaire hereby releases the City from any claims arising from the loss of or damage to Concessionaire's property.

 H. PRICING AND PRICE ADJUSTMENTS.

 Initial vending product prices will be as proposed in the Concessionaire's Proposal. Each year in January and July, the Concessionaire may submit a written request to DPR for price increases to reflect inflationary increases being charged to the Concessionaire. The Concessionaire shall document the economic rationale for the proposed increases to the sole satisfaction of DPR. Any change to the vending product prices remains subject to the Superintendent's approval.

<table><tr><td>Healthiest

</td><td>Healthier

</td><td>Excluded

</td></tr>

<tr><td>Milk, non-fat or low-fat (1%)

</td><td>'Flavored" milk, non-fat or 1%

</table> *Portion Size - Portion size is not defined for any items, but smaller portion sizes are preferred.  Healthiest -- must meet both criteria:

 o 3 grams of Total Fat or fewer per serving (Nuts and seeds exempt from restrictions.)

 o 30 grams of Carbohydrates or fewer per serving (All candies are considered unhealthy. Fruit in any form is permitted, regardless of carbohydrate count).

 Healthier -- must meet both criteria:

 o 5 grams of Total Fat or fewer per serving (Nuts and seeds exempt from restrictions.)

 o 30 grams of Carbohydrates or fewer per serving (All candies are considered unhealthy. Fruit in any form is permitted, regardless of carbohydrate count).

 Rationale -- Snacks *

 Fat: It was determined not to differentiate saturated fat from unsaturated fat. When total fat is considered, saturated fat tends to be low.

 Nuts and seeds: Nuts and seeds are exempt from the fat guidelines, because they are high in monounsaturated fat, which can help lower "bad" LDL cholesterol and maintain "good" HDL cholesterol. Nuts and seeds have been shown in many studies to reduce the risk of having a heart attack.

 Carbohydrates: The level of carbohydrates was set at 30 grams per serving to include more food items. All candies are considered unhealthy, regardless of carbohydrate content.

 Fruit: Fresh fruit is best, but fruit in any form (canned, fresh, and dried) was not restricted by carbohydrate standards because it provides vitamins, minerals, anti-oxidants and dietary fiber that are beneficial to an overall balanced diet.

 Portion size: Portion size is not defined, because there is variability among products. However, the preference is for smaller-portioned products.

<table><tr><td>

====================================================================================================================================================

</td></tr>

</table> Rationale -- Beverages  Milk in any form provides vitamins and minerals, but the low-fat and non-fat versions are preferred. Flavored milks are permitted.

 Water: Pure water is preferred, but water that is flavored maybe more attractive to someone who doesn't drink plain water. The vitamin-enhanced waters may benefit people with such nutritional needs, although pure water is the healthiest choice.

 Juice: Fruit and vegetable juices should contain 100 percent juice.

 Carbonation and caffeine: Carbonation in moderation does not have a significant effect on nutrition. Avoid caffeine-some low and non caffeine drinks may be considered. Carbonated low-calorie beverages may be another option for people who don't like milk or plain water.

 Low-calorie: Beverages containing 50 calories or fewer per 12 oz serving were deemed healthier options.

 **Portion sizes for juice is 6 ounces and for flavored milks is 8 ounces.

 Healthiest

 o Milk -- Low fat (1%) or Non-fat

 o Water

 o Juice -- 100% fruit or vegetable juice

 Healthier

 o Water -- Flavored or vitamin enhanced

 o Low-Calorie Beverage or diet sodas
