Tenant shall be permitted to use the Premises as outlined in Article 1.1, provided, however, that no part of the Premises shall be used as a shelter or similar use; a bar, nightclub, tavern (excluding a brew pub or restaurant pub, sports bar) or cocktail lounge (except for a restaurant that serves liquor and except for a martini bar or wine bar type concept); an adult book store or adult video store, X- rated videos or other sexually oriented businesses; check cashing operations; automotive maintenance or repair facility; thrift or surplus store; flea market, pawnshop, business selling second-hand goods (provided, however, first class stores which may include as part of their merchandise used, antiques or collectible items, are permitted); body or fender shop; recycling facility (except as required by law); mortuary, funeral parlor or similar establishment; house of worship; booth for the sale of fireworks; any mobile home or trailer court; shop selling drug paraphernalia; warehouse for the renting, leasing or selling of any boat, motor vehicle or trailer; or for industrial purposes. Tenant will refrain from using the Premises in any manner constituting a nuisance or waste and Tenant shall at all times comply with all statutes, laws, rules, regulations, ordinances, and orders of any governmental agency governing the use and occupancy of the Premises ("Applicable Laws"). If the Applicable Laws are hereafter changed so as to require during the Term of this Lease the construction of an addition to or an alteration of the Premises, the remediation of any Hazardous Substance, or the reinforcement or any other physical modification of the Premises ("Law-Required Capital Expenditure"), then Landlord and Tenant shall allocate the cost of such work as follows:

 (a) If such Law-Required Capital Expenditure is required as a result of the specific and unique use of the Premises or an Alteration (as defined in Section 9.4 below) or improvement made by Tenant, as compared with uses by tenants in general, Tenant shall be fully responsible for the cost thereof; provided, however, that if such Law-Required Capital Expenditure is required during the last two (2) years of this Lease and the cost thereof exceeds six (6) months' Base Rent, Tenant may instead terminate this Lease unless Law-Required Capital Expenditure is a direct result of the Tenant's Alterations

 (b) If such Law-Required Capital Expenditure is not the result of the specific and unique use of the Premises or an Alteration by Tenant, but applies to like property in general (such as, for example, governmentally-mandated seismic modifications), then Landlord or Tenant may terminate the lease by providing either party with 90 days of prior written notice; otherwise (i) Landlord shall be responsible for the cost thereof, and (ii) Tenant shall only be obligated to pay each month during the remainder of the Term of this Lease on the date on which Rent is due, an amount equal to the product of multiplying the cost of such replacement by a fraction, the numerator of which is one, and the denominator of which is the number of months of the useful life of such replacement as such useful life is specified pursuant to Federal income tax regulations or guidelines for depreciation thereof (including interest on the unamortized balance as is then commercially reasonable in the judgment of Landlord's accountants), with Tenant reserving the right to prepay its obligation at any time.

 ARTICLE 3-- DELIVERY OF PREMISES

 3.1  General.  Landlord shall use its best commercially reasonable efforts to deliver possession of the Premises to Tenant with Landlord's completion of Interior Improvements by the earliest date possible. However, if, despite such best efforts, Landlord fails to deliver the Premises by such date desired by Tenant, Landlord shall not be subject to any liability therefore nor shall such failure affect the validity of this Lease; provided, however, that if the Interior Improvements are not completed within 180 days following Lease Commencement Date, then the Tenant shall be entitled to terminate this Lease by providing ten (10) days' written notice to Landlord, upon which the Landlord shall be reimbursed for all direct costs incurred to the date of termination. Landlord request for reimbursement shall include invoices, statements and such other backup documentation as may be reasonably appropriate to establish and substantiate the costs for which Landlord seeks reimbursement.

 3.2  Condition of Premises Upon Delivery.  Landlord shall perform all such work as may be necessary in order deliver the Premises to Tenant in the condition that is specified on  Exhibit B , attached, hereinafter referred to as "Interior Improvements". Landlord shall perform such work at Landlord's expense. Landlord's contribution for Interior Improvements shall not exceed one hundred twenty nine thousand, six hundred dollars ($129,600.00) (hereinafter referred to as "Landlord's Contribution"). If and only if, upon completion of Interior Improvements, said work exceeds Landlord's Contribution, Tenant shall reimburse the Landlord for the cost above Landlord's Contribution, within thirty (30) days of Landlord submitting written request to Tenant for reimbursement. Landlord request for reimbursement shall include invoices, statements and such other backup documentation as may be reasonably appropriate to establish and substantiate the costs for which Landlord seeks reimbursement.

 (a)  Negotiation of Price and Terms Between Landlord and Tenant . Once Tenant's architect prepares the plans and other documents setting forth the design of and specifications for the Interior Improvements based on Tenant's Design Program (Exhibit B, attached) and once Tenant has approved the design and specifications thereof and provided them to the Landlord, Landlord shall propose, within fourteen (14) days thereafter, a price, construction timeframe, and payment timing and method for Tenant's consideration and approval (hereinafter, referred to as "Landlord's Interior Improvements Proposal"). Tenant shall not unreasonably withhold or condition its approval. If Landlord and Tenant agree in writing as to a price, construction timeframe, and payment timing and method for the Interior Improvements (hereinafter referred to as a "Landlord-Tenant Interior Construction Agreement"), then Landlord shall commence the Interior Improvements. If, however, Landlord and Tenant have not reached such a written agreement within thirty (30) days following Tenant's receipt of Landlord's Interior Improvements Proposal, Tenant shall be entitled to have its own construction contractor construct the Landlord-approved Interior Improvements at Tenant's sole discretion.

 (b)  Interior Improvements to Be Done in Accordance with Approved Plans and Specifications  All of the Interior Improvements shall be constructed or installed pursuant to the plans and specifications prepared by Tenant and approved, in writing, by Landlord.

 (c)  Tenant's Contractor's Insurance Policies to Name Landlord and Landlord's Property Manager . In the event that Tenant has its own contractor construct and install the Interior Improvements, Tenant's contractor shall name Landlord and Landlord's property manager and each of their respective managers, members, partners, officers, directors, employees and agents as primary and non-contributory additional insureds for all limits carried on all of contractor's insurance policies.

 (d)  Interior Improvements to Be Done in Accordance with Permits and Applicable Laws . All of the Interior Improvements shall be constructed and completed in a good, workmanlike manner. Landlord and Tenant shall obtain all necessary governmental permits, licenses and approvals with respect thereto. Landlord or Tenant (depending upon whether Landlord or Tenant's contractor constructs the Interior Improvements) shall fully comply with all governmental statutes, ordinances, rules, regulations and other laws pertaining to the construction and installation of the Interior Improvements.

 3.3  Change Orders . Without the prior approval of Landlord and Tenant (which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned), no changes shall be made to the design of the Interior Improvements. Landlord and Tenant shall promptly and diligently respond to any change order request made by the other party, and all change orders shall require the written agreement of both Landlord and Tenant to be effective. The costs for any work performed pursuant to a change order shall be the responsibility of Landlord and Tenant as follows:

 (a) The costs for any change order arising due to a Landlord request shall be the responsibility of Landlord.

 (b) In the event Tenant, Tenant's architect or Tenant's representative requests a change order related to the Interior Improvements, Landlord shall, within seven (7) days after such request, obtain a cost estimate on such change order from Landlord's general contractor and provide such cost estimate to Tenant for approval. Within seven (7) days after receipt of such cost estimate, Tenant shall either approve such cost estimate or reject such cost estimate. (Failure to timely approve in writing shall be deemed a rejection.) If approved by Tenant, such change order shall be deemed effective and, within thirty (30) days following substantial completion of the work contemplated by the change order, Tenant shall reimburse Landlord for the direct costs associated with such change order, not to exceed the amount of the estimate provided by Landlord's general contractor. If Tenant rejects the cost estimate provided by Landlord's general contractor, the change order shall be deemed ineffective, provided that if the work provided by the proposed change order proceeds without Tenant's approval, Landlord shall be solely responsible for the cost of such change order work as part of the Interior Improvements.

 (c) Tenant shall be financially responsible for all change orders requested and/or approved by Tenant that relate to the Interior Improvements.

 3.4  Warranty Claims : LANDLORD MAKES NO WARRANTIES, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO ANY IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE OR HABITABILITY.

In the event that the Landlord does not pursue any or all such claims, Tenant shall have the right to pursue such claims independently.

 3.5  Acceptance of Premises.  Upon Landlord's completion of the Interior Improvements and written notification of delivery of the Premises to Tenant, representatives of Landlord, Landlord's contractor, and Tenant shall together have a walk-through inspection of the Building within five (5) business days following Landlord's written notice to Tenant of completion of the Interior Improvements. Tenant shall acknowledge to Landlord in writing within twenty (20) business days following that notice that Tenant has inspected the Premises and accepts them in their then-existing condition or else, within said twenty (20) business day period, shall notify Landlord in writing of any deficiencies (the "Punch List Items"). Except for latent defects and all warranty claims, a failure by Tenant to provide the above written notice to Landlord within said twenty (20) business day period shall be deemed acceptance of the Premises in their then-existing condition. The Landlord's obligation and/or liability to Tenant for deficiencies shall be strictly limited to the correction of the noted deficiencies in the Punch List Items, which Landlord shall correct within thirty (30) days of Landlord's receipt of Tenant's notice of Punch List Items, which corrections need be made only to the extent of compliance with the Interior Improvements and any change orders. The "Acceptance Date" shall be the earlier of (i) completion of all Interior Improvements and Punch List Items or (ii) occupancy of the space.

 ARTICLE 4-- RENT

 4.1  Rent.  Tenant will pay monthly Rent to Landlord as payment for the use of the Premises. Monthly Rent will be paid in advance, at Landlord's address, on or before the first day of each calendar month of the Term, in lawful money of the United States, without notice or demand, except as provided herein. If the Term commences on a day other than the first day of a calendar month, then monthly Rent will be prorated for the first and last months, as applicable. Any amounts that this Lease requires Tenant to pay in addition to Base Rent will be deemed "Additional Rent".

 4.2  Late Charge and Interest . Tenant acknowledges that late payment by Tenant to Landlord of Rent will cause Landlord to incur costs not contemplated by this Lease, the exact amount of which will be extremely difficult to ascertain. Such costs include, but are not limited to, processing and accounting charges, and late charges which may be imposed upon Landlord by the terms of any ground lease, mortgage or deed of trust covering the Premises. Accordingly, if any installment of Rent or other sum due from Tenant shall not be received by Landlord or Landlord's designee within five (5) days after such amount shall be due, then, without any requirement for notice to Tenant, Tenant shall pay to Landlord a late charge ("Late Charge") equal to eight percent (8%) of such overdue amount. Any monetary payment due Landlord hereunder, other than late charges, not received by Landlord when due (as to scheduled payments such as monthly Rent) or within 30 days following the date on which it was due (for nonscheduled payments) shall bear interest from the date due, as to scheduled payments, or from the 31st day after the date due, as to nonscheduled payments. The interest ("Interest Rate") charged shall be computed at the rate of twelve percent (12%) per annum but shall not exceed the maximum rate allowed by law.

 4.3  Security Deposit . Upon the execution hereof, Tenant has deposited with Landlord as a security deposit the sum shown in Section 1.1, above. Said sum shall be held by Landlord as security for the faithful performance by Tenant of all the terms, covenants and conditions of this Lease to be kept and performed by Tenant during the entire term hereof. If Tenant defaults with respect to any provision of this Lease, including, but not limited to the provisions relating to the payment of Rent or other charges and sums due under this Lease, Landlord may (but shall not be required to) use, apply or retain all or any part of the security deposit for the payment of any Rent, or other charges or sum due under this Lease or any sum in default, or for the payment of any amount which Landlord may spend or become obligated to spend by reason of Tenant's default, or to compensate Landlord for any other loss, damage, cost or expense (including attorneys' fees) which Landlord may suffer or incur by reason of Tenant's default. If any portion of said security deposit is so used or applied, Tenant shall, within ten (10) days after written demand therefor, deposit a certified or cashier's check with Landlord in an amount sufficient to restore the security deposit. If Tenant shall fully and faithfully perform every provision of this Lease to be performed by it, the security deposit or any balance thereof after deduction hereunder by Landlord shall be returned to Tenant (or, at Landlord's option, to the last assignee of Tenant's interest hereunder) within thirty (30) days following expiration of the Lease Term; provided that, in the event this Lease shall be terminated by, or upon the default of, the Tenant, the security deposit shall be retained by Landlord and all of Tenant's interest therein shall terminate. In the event of termination of Landlord's interest in this Lease, Landlord shall transfer said deposit to Landlord's successor-in-interest.

Said insurance premiums shall include all insurance premiums for fire, flood, earthquake, liability, loss of rents insurance, and any other insurance and endorsements, which may include an "all risk" endorsement, or any other commercially reasonable insurance that Landlord or Landlord's lender deems necessary.

 (b) The term "real estate taxes" shall include all real estate taxes and assessments, whether special or general and including any road improvement districts, water improvement district, if any, and any other utility installation hookup, tie-in or similar charges or assessments that are levied upon and/or assessed against the Premises and/or payable during or with respect to the Lease Term and the cost of professional consultants and/or counsel to analyze tax bills and prosecute any protest, refunds and appeals; provided, that all such payments shall be paid on a cash basis without regard to whether such real estate taxes apply to a period before or after the Lease Term (or any Renewal Term) and without regard to whether Tenant was in possession of the Premises during the time covered by the particular tax statement.

 5.2  Operating Costs.  "Operating Costs" means all costs and expenses paid or incurred for maintaining, operating, repairing, replacing, owning and administrating the Premises, and the personal property directly used in conjunction therewith, including without limitation, the costs of services; supplies; compensation (including employment taxes and fringe benefits) of all persons who perform duties in connection with the operation, maintenance, repair, replacement and administration of the Premises, its equipment and facilities. Tenant shall be responsible for maintaining the Premises and payment of all Operating Costs; however, if Landlord for any reason pays for an Operating Cost more than once in a two year period, Landlord shall charge Tenant for the entire cost plus a management fee of ten (10) percent of the cost and Tenant shall reimburse Landlord within 30 days of receipt of an invoice. It is understood that in no event shall Operating Costs include the following (a) lease commissions; (b) depreciation on the building; (c) interest payments and financing costs associated with the Premises financing; (d) legal fees associated with the preparation, interpretation and/or enforcement of leases; (e) repairs and replacements for which and to the extent that Landlord has been reimbursed by insurance and/or paid pursuant to warranties or paid by third parties; (f) advertising and promotional expenses; (g) costs representing amounts paid to an affiliate of Landlord for services or materials which are in excess of the amounts which would have been paid in the absence of such relationships; (h) interest, points and fees on debt or amortization on or for any mortgage or mortgages encumbering the Premises, and all principal escrow deposits and other sums paid on or in respect to any indebtedness and on any equity participation of any lender or lessor, and all costs incurred in connection with any financing, refinancing, or syndication of the Premises; (i) Landlord's charitable contributions; (j) or any franchise fees or license fees.

 5.3  Definition of Adjustments . For purposes of this Lease, the term "Adjustments" means, collectively, real estate taxes, insurance, the Operating Costs and other costs and expenses to be paid pursuant to this Article 5.

 5.4  Statement of Adjustments .

 (a)  Procedural and Substantive Provisions . Upon commencement of the obligation to pay Adjustments, Landlord shall submit to Tenant a statement of the anticipated monthly Adjustments and other charges, if any, as reasonably determined by Landlord for the period between Rent Commencement and calendar year end. Tenant shall pay the same and all subsequent monthly payments of Adjustments concurrently with the payment of Monthly Rent, such Adjustments shall be due and payable on or before the first day of each month, in advance, without adjustment or offset. Tenant shall continue to make said monthly payments of Adjustments until notified by Landlord of a change thereof. By March 1 of each year during the Term of this Lease, Landlord shall give Tenant a statement showing the total Adjustments and other charges, if any, for the prior calendar year along with its supporting documentation. The first and last such statements during the Lease Term shall be prorated from the commencement of the obligation to pay Adjustments and the expiration of the Lease Term. In the event that the total of the monthly payments of Adjustments which Tenant has made for the prior Lease Year shall be less than the Adjustments and other charges, then Tenant shall pay the difference in a lump sum within thirty (30) days after receipt of such statement from Landlord and shall concurrently pay the difference in monthly payments which are then calculated as monthly Adjustments and other charges next coming due. In the event that the total of the monthly payments of Adjustments which Tenant has made for the prior Lease Year exceed the actual Adjustments and other charges, then Landlord shall credit such excess to the next monthly payments of such Adjustments and other charges which thereafter come due. Even though the Lease Term has expired or has been terminated and Tenant has vacated the Premises, when the final determination is made of said Adjustments and other charges for the year in which the Lease expires or terminates, Tenant shall immediately pay any increase due over the estimated Adjustments and other charges previously paid and, conversely, any overpayment made shall be immediately rebated by Landlord to Tenant, provided that all or any part of such refund may be applied by Landlord in payment of any delinquent or past due sum, including Rent or any other amounts due from Tenant.

 (b)  Tenant's Right to Audit . Throughout the Term, Landlord shall keep complete and accurate books and records documenting its determination of the Assessments. Tenant and its authorized representatives shall have the right, at Tenant's sole cost and on no less than ten (10) days' prior written notice to Landlord, to audit Landlord's records and books regarding the Adjustments. Such an audit shall be performed at Landlord's principal accounting offices by either (a) an employee or consultant of Tenant who is qualified in property management practices; (b) the Washington State Auditor; or (c) a certified public accountant (a "Qualified Auditor"). There shall be no more than one (1) audit in any twelve-month (12-month) period.

 5.5  Other Taxes to be Paid By Tenant . Tenant will pay promptly when due all personal property taxes on Tenant's personal property in and on the Premises and any other taxes payable by Tenant, the non-payment of which might give rise to a lien on the Premises or on Tenant's interest in the Premises.

 5.6  Utilities . Tenant will be solely responsible for and will contract directly for provision of and pay the appropriate utility purveyors for all water, sewer, gas, electricity, heat, and other utilities and communications services used by Tenant on the Premises during the Term and during any holdover period. Commencing on the Rent Commencement Date, Tenant shall arrange to have all utilities billed directly to Tenant. If Landlord furnishes any of the above utilities, Tenant shall reimburse Landlord at the cost charged by the utility company to the Landlord of such utilities.

Landlord and Tenant each waives any and all rights to recover against the other, or against the officers, directors, shareholders, partners, joint ventures, employees, agents, customers, invitees or business visitors of such other party, for any loss or damage to such waiving party arising from any cause covered by any property insurance required to be carried pursuant to this section or any other property insurance actually carried by such party. Landlord and Tenant, from time to time, will cause their respective insurers to issue appropriate waiver of subrogation rights endorsements to all property insurance policies carried in connection with the Premises.

 6.5  Acts of Others . Neither party shall be responsible or liable to the other (or to those claiming by, through or under either party) for any loss or damage that may be occasioned by or through the acts or omissions of third parties or persons occupying space adjoining the Premises. In addition, Landlord shall not be responsible or liable to Tenant for any loss or damage resulting to Tenant (or those claiming by, through or under Tenant) or any of its property, from fire; explosion; falling plaster; the breaking, bursting, stoppage or leaking of water, gas, sewer, electrical cables, wires or steam pipes; or from water, rain or other substances leaking or coming from the roof, street, subsurface or from any other place or from dampness or from any similar risks or causes except and to the extent such loss or damage is caused by Landlord's negligence. Landlord shall not be liable for any loss or damage to any person or property sustained by Tenant or any other persons that may be caused by theft or by any act or neglect of any other third parties.

 (c) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Lease, Tenant shall not be responsible for the remediation or indemnification in relation to Hazardous Materials which were present in, on, or under, the Premises prior to the Lease Commencement Date, or which have migrated onto, or under, the Premises from adjacent properties. Landlord represents and warrants that the Premises shall be delivered free and clear of all Hazardous Materials. Landlord, at Landlord's sole expense and with counsel reasonably acceptable to Tenant, shall indemnify, defend and hold harmless Tenant and Tenant's shareholders, directors, officers, employees, partners, affiliates, and agents with respect to any and all losses arising out of or resulting from any Hazardous Materials present in, on, or about the Premises prior to the Lease Commencement Date and/or the release of any Hazardous Materials in, on or about the Leased Premises by Landlord or Landlord's agents, contractors, or invitees, or the violation of any environmental law, by Landlord or Landlord's agents, contractors, or invitees. This indemnification shall survive the expiration or earlier termination of this Lease.

 ARTICLE 8- Intentionally Omitted

 ARTICLE 9-- REPAIRS AND MAINTENANCE

 9.1  Tenant's Maintenance and Repair Obligations . With the exception of normal "wear and tear", and except as set forth in Section 3.2, above and Section 9.2, below, Tenant will, at its sole cost and expense, maintain the Premises and make non-Capital Repairs, restorations, and replacements to the Premises, including without limitation the heating, ventilating, air conditioning, mechanical, electrical, and plumbing systems, interior walls, and the fixtures and appurtenances to the Premises as and when needed to preserve them in good working order and condition.

 9.2  Capital Repairs, Replacements or Improvements . If any Capital Repairs are required to be made to the Premises after the date hereof, the cost of the Capital Repairs (the "Capital Cost") will be a capital expenditure initially paid for and performed by Landlord or its contractors (subject to reimbursement, as hereinafter more particularly set forth). Tenant shall be obligated to pay each month, during the remainder of the Term of this Lease (including any options to extend the Term), its allocated share of the costs of the Capital Cost ("Tenant's Monthly Allocation"). Tenant's Monthly Allocation shall be the quotient resulting from dividing the Capital Cost by the useful life (expressed in number of months) of the Capital Repair, as such useful life is specified pursuant to Federal income tax regulations or guidelines for depreciation thereof. Tenant's Monthly Allocation shall be paid until the earlier of (i) the Term of this Lease (including any renewals and/or any Holdover) expires or (ii) the Capital Cost has been fully reimbursed. A "Capital Repair" shall mean any repair or improvement (including roof replacement) which under standard accounting practices is considered a "capital" improvement and is amortized over a given life for such item, which life may exceed the remaining Term of the Lease. All repairs, restorations, and replacements will be in quality and class equal to the original work or installations.

 9.3  Landlord's Representations.  Landlord represents and warrants that, as of the Lease Commencement Date, the heating, ventilating, air conditioning, roll door, mechanical, fire sprinkler, HVAC, electrical, and plumbing systems provided in the Premises are in good working order and condition. In addition, Landlord shall deliver the Premises to Tenant clean and free of debris, asbestos, asbestos-containing products, or toxic substances. If a non-compliance with said warranty exists as of the Rent Commencement Date, then, except as otherwise provided in this Lease, Landlord shall promptly, after receipt of written notice from Tenant setting forth with specificity the nature and extent of such non- compliance, rectify same at Landlord's expense.

 9.4  Alterations . During the Lease Term, Tenant shall have the right, at its own cost and expense, and sole responsibility (except as otherwise specifically set forth in this Lease) to make alterations, installations and changes in, on and to the interior of the Building (hereinafter collectively called "Alterations") as it shall deem expedient or necessary for its business purposes without Landlord's prior written consent if such Alterations will not adversely affect the structural integrity of the Premises or pierce the roof membrane or floor slab or affect the mechanical, electrical or plumbing systems ("Non-Structural Alterations"). (All other alterations, installations and changes in, on and to the interior of the Buildings are hereinafter collectively called "Structural Alterations"). Tenant may not make any Structural Alterations unless it has first obtained Landlord's written consent thereto and to the contractor undertaking such Structural Alterations, which consent Landlord may withhold in its sole and absolute discretion by giving notice thereof to Tenant within ten (10) days following Landlord's receipt of a written request for consent that includes copies of construction plans for the proposed Structural Alterations. Tenant shall notify Landlord prior to beginning any construction.

 At any time prior to the expiration of the Lease Term, Tenant may remove from the Premises any or all interior and Non-Structural Alterations and any of Tenant's signage (whether or not interior or non-structural), provided that any damage caused by such removal shall be promptly repaired by Tenant.

 Not later than the date of any surrender, expiration or termination of this Lease, Tenant (a) may remove all interior and Non-Structural Alterations and (b) shall remove or leave in place any and all Structural Alterations in accordance with Landlord's direction, made within thirty (30) days following Landlord's receipt of Tenant's initial written notice of such planned Structural Alterations (if Landlord has given no direction as to any particular Structural Alterations within said 30-day period, Tenant shall be deemed to have the option to remove or leave any particular Structural Alterations). Tenant shall promptly repair any damage caused by such removal and, until Tenant gives Landlord written notice that such removal and repair of any damage is completed, Tenant shall be deemed to be remaining in possession of the Premises after the expiration of the Lease Term without Landlord's written consent and holding over. If such removal and repair is not fully completed by the date of any surrender, expiration or termination of this Lease, Landlord shall be entitled to complete it at Tenant's expense, in an amount not in excess of the reasonable cost of completing such removal and repair.

 9.5  Tenant's Contractor Liens and Insurance . Tenant shall not (a) create or place any lien or encumbrance on the interest of Landlord or Tenant in the Premises or (b) charge the rentals payable hereunder for any claim in favor of any person dealing with Tenant, including those who may furnish materials or perform labor for any construction or repairs. Tenant shall (x) timely pay or cause to be paid all sums legally due and payable by it on account of any labor performed or materials furnished in connection with any work performed on the Premises by or on behalf of Tenant and (y) save and hold Landlord harmless from all loss, cost or expense based on or arising out of asserted claims or liens against the leasehold estate or against the interest of Landlord in the Premises or under this Lease arising from any work performed by or on behalf of Tenant. Tenant shall give Landlord prompt written notice of the placing of any lien or encumbrance against the Premises and cause such lien or encumbrance to be discharged within 30 days of the filing or recording thereof or, at its election shall contest such liens or encumbrances as long as such contest prevents foreclosure of the lien or encumbrance and Tenant causes such lien or encumbrance to be bonded or insured over in a manner reasonably satisfactory to Landlord within such 30 day period. Additionally, Tenant shall require all Contractors performing work on the Premise to adhere to the Insurance requirements outlined in Article 6.1 and name the Landlord as additional insured.

 ARTICLE 10-- END OF TERM

 10.1  End of Term . At the end of the Term (or, as may be the case, the end of the Renewal Term), Tenant will promptly quit and surrender the Premises in good order and repair, ordinary wear and tear and casualty excepted. Tenant will remove all of Tenant's furniture, trade fixtures, signage, equipment, other personal property, and wiring. Tenant's obligations under this Article will survive the expiration or other termination of this Lease.

 10.2  Holdover . If Tenant remains in possession of the Premises after the expiration of the tenancy created hereunder without the written consent of Landlord and without execution of a new lease, Tenant shall be deemed to occupy the Premises under a month-to month tenancy, terminable at will by Landlord and subject to all provisions hereof (other than those relating to Lease Term), except that Base Rent for each month of holdover period shall be equivalent to 125% of the last monthly Base Rent due under this Lease.

 ARTICLE 11-- DEFAULT

 11.1  Events of Default . The occurrence of any one of the following events shall constitute an "Event of Default" hereunder by Tenant:

 (a) The failure by Tenant to make any payment required to be made by Tenant hereunder within ten (10) days after written notice from Landlord of such failure.

 (b) Unless otherwise specifically noted in this Lease, the failure by Tenant to observe or perform any of the covenants or other provisions of this Lease to be observed or performed by Tenant, where such failure continues for a period of thirty (30) days upon written notice thereof from Landlord to Tenant after such failure; provided that if the nature of Tenant's default is such that more than thirty (30) days are reasonably required for its cure, then Tenant shall not be deemed to be in default if Tenant commences such cure within said thirty (30) day period and thereafter diligently prosecutes such cure to completion.

 (c) The making by Tenant of any general assignment or general arrangement for the benefit of creditors, or by the filing by or against Tenant of a petition to have Tenant adjudged a bankrupt, or a petition for reorganization or arrangement under any law relating to bankruptcy (unless, in the case of a petition filed against Tenant, the same is dismissed within sixty (60) days of filing), or the appointment of a trustee or a receiver to take possession of substantially all of Tenant's assets located at the Premises or of Tenant's interest in this Lease, where such seizure is not discharged within thirty (30) days after appointment of said trustee or receiver, or the filing of a petition for the appointment of the same, whichever shall first occur.

 (d) Tenant's failure to perform or observe any of Tenant's obligations under the Lease after Tenant has failed to perform or observe any of Tenant's obligations under the Lease at least twice previously (despite the fact Tenant may have cured any such previous failures after notice from Landlord and within the notice period).

 11.2  Remedies of Landlord .

 (a) On the occurrence of an Event of Default, Landlord shall have the following rights:

 (1) To terminate this Lease by any lawful means including the giving of written notice to Tenant, in which case Tenant's right to possession of the Premises will cease and Tenant shall immediately surrender possession of the Premises to Landlord. Landlord may lawfully reenter and take possession of the Premises, expel Tenant and remove the effects of Tenant, using such force for such purposes as may be reasonably necessary, without being liable for prosecution, and without prejudice to any remedies for arrears of Rent or other amounts payable under this Lease. In the event of such termination, Landlord shall be entitled to recover from Tenant (i) all past due Rents and other charges for which Tenant is liable to pay under this Lease; (ii) the reasonable expenses of re-letting the Premises, including without limitation, reasonably necessary refurbishment of the Premises and reasonable attorneys' fees; (iii) the worth at the time of award of the amount by which the unpaid rent and other charges called for in this Lease for the balance of the Lease Term (or the Renewal Term, as the case may be) after the time of such award exceeds the amount of such loss for the same period that Tenant proves could be reasonably avoided; and (iv) that portion of any leasing commission paid by Landlord and applicable to the unexpired Term of this Lease. Unpaid installments of Rent or other sums due under this section shall bear an interest from the due date at the rate of 12 % per annum but not higher than the highest lawful rate.

 (2) To lawfully reenter and take possession of the Premises, expel Tenant and remove the effects of Tenant, using such force for such purposes as may be reasonably necessary, and without prejudice to any remedies for arrears of Rent or other amounts payable under this Lease. In such case, Landlord may, without being obligated to and without terminating the Lease, Re-let the Premises for the account of Tenant on such conditions and terms as Landlord may determine, and Landlord may collect and receive Rent. Tenant will pay to Landlord Rent, Additional Rent, and other sums as provided in this Lease that would be payable under this Lease if such repossession had not occurred, less the net proceeds, if any, of any reletting of the Premises after deducting all of Landlord's reasonable, direct, and actual expenses in connection with such reletting.

 (3) To cure any event of default and to charge Tenant for the cost of effecting such cure, including without limitation reasonable attorney's fees and interest provided that Landlord will have no obligation to cure any such Event of Default of Tenant.

 (b) Upon any Event of Default hereunder by Tenant, Landlord shall be required to use commercially reasonable efforts to mitigate its damages. Landlord shall not be obligated to enter into a lease with any proposed substitute tenant that does not have, in Landlord's reasonable judgment, sufficient financial resources to operate the Premises.

 11.3  Landlord's Default . In the event of any default by Landlord in the performance of its obligations under this Lease, Tenant will deliver to Landlord written notice of such default.

 (a) If Landlord fails to cure such default within five (5) business days after written notice of such default (the "Cure Period"), Tenant shall have the right, in its sole discretion, to exercise such self-help measures as may be reasonably necessary to cure Landlord's default. Any costs and expenses reasonably incurred by Tenant to cure such default shall be reimbursed by Landlord upon demand.

 (b) If Landlord fails to cure any default within thirty (30) days after receipt of notice of such default, Tenant shall have the right to terminate this Lease, without penalty, upon notice to Landlord, such termination to be effective as of the termination date designated on Tenant's termination notice; provided, however, if the nature of Landlord's default is such that more than thirty (30) days are reasonably required for its cure, then Landlord shall not be deemed to be in default (and Tenant shall have no right to terminate this Lease) if Landlord commences such cure within said thirty (30)-day period and thereafter diligently prosecutes such cure to completion.

 11.4  Remedies Not Exclusive . Each right and remedy provided for in this Lease is cumulative and is in addition to every other right or remedy provided for in this Lease or at law or in equity. Either party's exercise of any rights or remedies due to a default or breach by the other shall not be deemed a waiver of or to alter, affect or prejudice any rights or remedies that the non- breaching party may have under this Lease, law or in equity. Neither the acceptance of Rent nor any other acts or omissions of Landlord at any time(s) after the happening of any event authorizing cancellation or forfeiture of this Lease shall (a) operate as a waiver of any of Tenant's past or future violation, breach or failure to keep or perform any covenant, agreement, term or condition hereof or to deprive Landlord of its right to cancel or forfeit this Lease upon the written notice provided for herein at any time that cause for cancellation or forfeiture may exist, or (b) be construed so as to stop Landlord from promptly exercising any other option, right or remedy that it may have under any term or provision of this Lease, at law, or in equity.

 11.5  Acceptance of Payment.  Landlord's acceptance of any sum (whether as Rent, Additional Rent, or otherwise) that is less than the amount claimed as due by Landlord shall not act as, or be deemed to be, a waiver of such claimed amount as a compromise or accord and satisfaction of the amount that Landlord claimed is due.

 ARTICLE 12-- OPTION TO RENEW -- SEE EXHIBIT C

 ARTICLE 13-- GENERAL

 13.1  Condemnation . If the Premises are taken by exercise of the power of eminent domain (or conveyed by Landlord in lieu of such exercise), then this Lease will terminate on a date (the "Termination Date") which is the earlier of the date upon which the condemning authority takes possession of the Premises or the date on which title to the Premises is vested in the condemning authority. Tenant shall be due any and all award allocated to Tenant by condemning authority.

 13.2  Assignment and Subletting .

 (a) Tenant shall not assign, transfer, mortgage, pledge, hypothecate or encumber this Lease or any interest therein, nor sublet the whole or any part of the Premises, nor shall this Lease or any interest hereunder be assignable or transferable by operation of law or by any process or proceeding of any court, or otherwise, without the prior written consent of Landlord, which shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned, or delayed. Any such transaction undertaken without Landlord's prior written consent shall be null and void. In determining whether to grant consent to Tenant's assignment or transfer request, Landlord may consider any factor, including but not limited to the following: the experience and business reputation of the proposed assignee or transferee in operating a business for the uses set forth in the Lease; whether the proposed assignee or transferee has a net worth, and financial strength and credit record, satisfactory to Landlord; whether use of the Lease Premises by the proposed assignee or transferee will violate or create any potential violation of (a) any laws or (b) permitted uses as outlined in Article 1.1 and 2 of the Lease; and whether the quality of the business to be operated by the proposed assignee or transferee is reasonably satisfactory to Landlord.

 (b) No assignment or other transfer shall relieve Tenant of any liability under this Lease. The acceptance by Landlord of any amounts of money as rent or otherwise following any transaction prohibited hereunder shall not be deemed to be a consent by Landlord nor shall the same be deemed to be a waiver of any right or remedy of Landlord hereunder. Consent to any such assignment or other transfer shall not operate as a waiver of the necessity for consent to any subsequent assignment or transfer. In connection with any assignment or transfer, Tenant shall promptly provide Landlord with fully executed copies of all assignment, sublease, transfer, and assumption instruments.

 (c) As a condition to Landlord's consent, any potential assignee or transferee otherwise approved by Landlord shall expressly assume all existing and future obligations of Tenant under this Lease and shall be jointly and severally liable with Tenant for the payment of Rent, Adjustments, other charges, and the performance of all terms, covenants, and conditions of this Lease.

 (d) Tenant and any assignee, subtenant or transferee shall reimburse Landlord for Landlord's reasonable attorneys' fees and costs incurred in conjunction with the processing and documentation of any such requested transfer, assignment, subleasing or encumbrance, up to a maximum amount of $2,500.00.

 (e)  Assignment by Landlord . If Landlord sells or otherwise transfers the Premises, or if the Landlord assigns its interest in this Lease, and such purchaser, transferee, or assignee thereof assumes Landlord's obligation hereunder arising thereafter, then Landlord shall thereupon be relieved of all liabilities hereunder arising thereafter but this Lease shall otherwise remain in full force and effect.

 13.3 Intentionally Omitted

 13.4  Notices . Any notice or other communication required or permitted under this Lease must be in writing and shall be (a) personally delivered, or (b) mailed via certified or registered mail, return receipt requested, postage prepaid, or (c) shipped via express courier service for "next day" delivery. Such notices shall be addressed as follows:

The parties shall promptly give written notice to each other of any change of address and mailing or shipment to the addresses stated herein shall be deemed sufficient unless written notification of a change of address has been received. Either Landlord or Tenant may add additional addresses or change its address for purposes of receipt of any such communication by giving ten (10) days' prior written notice of such change to the other party in the manner prescribed in this section.

 13.5  Brokers' Commissions . Tenant represents and warrants that it has incurred no liabilities or claims for brokerage commissions or finder's fees in connection with the execution of this Lease and that it has not dealt with or has any knowledge of any real estate broker, agent or salesperson in connection with this Lease except: Maria Royer of RST, LLC, a Washington limited liability company, as the Landlord's Broker, and Derek Hermsen, of Flinn Ferguson as the Tenant's Broker. With the exceptions of the Landlord's Broker and Tenant's Broker, the parties agree to indemnify and hold each other harmless from all such liabilities or claims (including, without limitation, attorney's fees) for any other broker fees.

 13.6  Signs . Provided Tenant obtains Landlord's prior written consent (which shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed), Tenant shall be entitled to install, in compliance with all Applicable Laws, signage on the exterior of the Premises containing Tenant's name, logo, and other pertinent business information. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Landlord reserves the right to install a "For Lease" sign during the last six (6) months of the Term and Renewal Terms of this Lease and during any holdover period.

 13.7  Subordination and Nondisturbance . This Lease and Tenant's rights under this Lease are subject and subordinate to any mortgage or deed of trust (each, a "Superior Lien"), together with any renewals, extensions, modifications, consolidations and replacements of such Superior Lien, now or after the date of this Lease affecting or placed, charged or enforced against the Premises or any interest of Landlord in the Premises or Landlord's interest in this Lease and the leasehold estate created by this Lease (except to the extent any such instrument will expressly provide that this Lease is superior to such instrument). Notwithstanding the foregoing, such subordination shall not be effective unless the holder of such Superior Lien shall deliver to Tenant a written agreement reasonably satisfactory to Tenant that Tenant's rights under this Lease shall not be disturbed by such holder so long as Tenant has paid all amounts then owing and is otherwise not in default under this Lease. Tenant will execute, acknowledge and deliver to Landlord within twenty (20) days after written demand by Landlord such documents as may be reasonably requested by Landlord or the holder of any Superior Lien to confirm or effect any such subordination, priority, or nondisturbance, provided that any such subordination agreement contains a nondisturbance agreement as set forth above.

 13.8  Governing Law . This Lease will be governed by the internal laws of the state in which the Premises are located, without reference to its conflict of laws provisions.

 13.9  Binding Effect . This Lease will bind and inure to the benefit of Landlord and Tenant and their respective successors, heirs, administrators and assigns, except as otherwise provided in this Lease.

 13.10  Disputes . In the event of a dispute regarding this Lease, the Parties agree to follow the procedures in this Section 13.10 prior to commencing any other legal process. The Parties shall make their best efforts to resolve disputes as expeditiously as possible through negotiations at the lowest possible decision-making level and in the event such negotiations are unsuccessful, the matter shall be referred to Tenant's representative and Landlord's representative. If those officials are unable to resolve the dispute within a period of fifteen (15) days after the matter has been formally referred to them for resolution, they shall meet during the immediately succeeding seven (7) days to select a mediator to assist in the resolution of such dispute. The Parties agree to participate in mediation with the agreed upon mediator for a reasonable amount of time and in good faith. The cost of the mediation shall be shared equally between the Parties.

 Any dispute under this Lease that cannot be resolved by mediation shall be settled and finally determined by arbitration before an arbitrator of JAMS/Endispute in Seattle, Washington in accordance with the Superior Court Mandatory Arbitration Rules (MAR) then in effect in the State of Washington, as the same may be amended or superseded from time to time. If the parties are unable to agree upon a JAMS/Endispute arbitrator, then each party shall take turns striking from the list of all of the JAMS/Endispute arbitrators (with the party initiating the arbitration proceeding taking the first turn) until only one arbitrator is left, who shall be the arbitrator for the dispute. If, at the time the arbitration is to be initiated, JAMS/Endispute is no longer in existence, then (a) the parties shall either (i) agree upon a similar arbitration service located in Seattle, Washington or (ii) seek to have the King County Superior Court Presiding Judge select a similar arbitration service if the parties are unable to agree upon one and (b) the particular arbitrator shall be selected in the same manner as set forth in the immediately preceding sentence. The arbitrator is hereby specifically empowered to grant both monetary and equitable relief to either one or both of the parties consistent with this Agreement. The judgment upon the award rendered in any such arbitration shall be final and binding upon the parties and may be entered in King County Superior Court. Attorneys' fees and costs of expert witnesses shall be awarded to the prevailing party by the arbitrator and shall likewise be awarded if incurred to enforce the award in King County Superior Court or on appeal therefrom.

 13.11  Authority . Each of the parties executing this Lease on behalf of the Tenant or the Landlord represents to the other party that such party is authorized to do so by requisite action of the party to this Lease.

 13.12  Time of the Essence . Time is of the essence for the performance of all obligations under this Lease.

 13.13  Quiet Enjoyment . Provided that Tenant timely pays Rent and timely performs all of the other covenants and conditions of this Lease to be performed by the Tenant hereunder, Tenant shall be entitled to the quiet enjoyment and possession of the Premises without hindrance, disturbance, or molestation by Landlord, its agents, or other tenants, subject to the terms and conditions of this Lease.

 13.14  Gender . Masculine or feminine pronouns may be substituted for each other or for the neuter form or vice versa, and the plural may be substituted for the singular or vice versa in any place or places herein where the contract requires such substitutions.

 13.15  Prior Agreements . It is understood that there are no oral or written agreements or representations between Landlord and Tenant affecting this Lease and that this Lease supersedes and cancels any and all previous negotiations, arrangements, representations, brochures, displays, projections, estimates, agreements and understandings, if any, made by or between Landlord and Tenant with respect to the subject matter thereof, and none thereof shall be used to interpret, construe, supplement or contradict this Lease. This Lease (including its attached exhibits) and any and all mutually-executed, written amendments thereto are and shall be considered to be the only agreement between Landlord and Tenant.

 13.16  Reconstruction---Insured Loss . In the event that the Premises are damaged by fire or other perils covered by the Landlord's insurance, Landlord agrees to forthwith repair the same, and this Lease shall remain in full force and effect, except that Tenant shall be entitled to a proportionate reduction of the Monthly Rent from the date of damage and while such repairs are being made, such proportionate reduction to be based upon the extent to which the damage and making of such repairs shall reasonably interfere with the business carried on by Tenant in the Premises; provided, that if the damage is due to the gross negligence or willful misconduct of Tenant or its employees, there shall be no abatement of rent. Tenant shall be responsible at its sole cost and expense for repairing or replacing any of Tenant's fixtures, equipment and leasehold improvements that are damaged or destroyed by the insured cause.

 13.17  Uninsured Loss . In the event that the Premises are damaged as a result of any cause other than the perils covered by the Landlord's insurance, then Landlord shall (except where the damage or destruction is caused by negligence of Tenant, its employees, agents, contractors, licensees or invitees in which case Tenant shall repair all damage) forthwith repair the same, provided the extent of the destruction is less than ten percent (10%) of the then full replacement cost of the Premises. In the event the destruction of the Premises is to an extent of ten percent (10%) or more of the full replacement cost, Landlord shall have the option to: (1) repair or restore such damage, this Lease continuing in full force and effect, but the Monthly Rent to be proportionately reduced as provided in Section 13.16; or (2) give notice to Tenant at any time within sixty (60) days after such damage, terminating this Lease as of the date specified in such notice, which date shall be no more than thirty (30) days after the giving of such notice. In the event Landlord elects to terminate this Lease, Tenant shall have the right within ten (10) days after receipt of the termination notice to give written notice to Landlord of Tenant's commitment to pay for the repair of such damage without reimbursement from Landlord. Tenant shall provide Landlord with said funds or satisfactory assurance thereof within thirty (30) days after making such commitment. In such event this Lease shall continue in full force and effect, and Landlord shall proceed to make such repairs as soon as reasonably possible after the required funds are available. If Tenant does not make the required commitment, this Lease shall terminate as of the date specified in the termination notice and the Monthly Rent for the period between the date of the damage or destruction and the date of that notice of termination shall be reduced proportionately, based upon the extent, if any, to which such damage substantially interfered with the business carried on by the Tenant in the Premises. Tenant shall at its sole cost and expense, repair and restore any of the Tenant's fixture equipment and leasehold improvements which are damaged or destroyed by the uninsured cause if the Premises are restored.

 13.18  Damage Near End of Term . If at any time during (a) the last six (6) months of this Lease or (b) the Redevelopment Period, there is damage for which the time to rebuild or repair exceeds one hundred twenty (120) days, Landlord or Tenant may terminate this Lease effective sixty (60) days following the date of occurrence by giving a written termination to Lessee within thirty (30) days after the date of occurrence of such damage. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if Tenant at that time has an exercisable option to extend this Lease, the Tenant may preserve this Lease by exercising such option within ten (10) days after Tenant's receipt of Landlord's written notice purporting to terminate this Lease. If Tenant duly exercises such option during such period, then Landlord shall repair such damage as soon as reasonably possible and this Lease shall continue in full force and effect. If Tenant fails to exercise such option, the Monthly Rent for the period between the date of the damage or destruction and the date of termination shall be reduced proportionately, based upon the extent, if any, to which such damage substantially interfered with the business carried on by the Tenant in the Premises, and Tenant's option shall be extinguished.

 13.19  Estoppel Certificates . At any time and from time to time but within twenty (20) days after prior written request by either Tenant or Landlord, the other party will execute, acknowledge and deliver to the requesting party a certificate certifying (a) that this Lease is unmodified and in full force and effect or, if there have been modifications, that this Lease is in full force and effect, as modified, and stating the date and nature of each modification; (b) the date, if any, to which Rent and other sums payable under this Lease have been paid; (c) that no written notice of any default has been delivered by the certifying party, which default has not been cured, except as to defaults specified in said certificate; and (d) to the best of the certifying party's knowledge, there is no Event of Default under this Lease or an event which, with notice or the passage of time, or both, would result in an Event of Default under this Lease, except for defaults specified in said certificate. Any such certificate may be relied upon by any prospective purchaser, lease assignee, or sublessee, or existing or prospective mortgagee or beneficiary under any deed of trust of the Premises. If the requested party fails to deliver such a certificate within such time, the statements contained in such certificate will conclusively be deemed made and admitted by the requested party.

 Option to Renew

 Tenant is granted the option to extend the term of this Lease beyond the expiration of the initial term for sixty (60) months on all the provisions contained in the Lease except for the Base Rent. The conditions which must be met for Tenant to exercise its right are as follows:

 (a) Tenant shall not be in default on the date of notice;

 (b) Tenant has fully and faithfully performed all of the covenants, conditions and terms of this Lease at all times;

 (c) Tenant shall deliver to Landlord written notice ("Election Notice") of Tenant's election to exercise the option to extend at least six (6) months but not more than nine (9) months before the Expiration Date

 If Tenant fails to satisfy or comply with any or all of the above conditions, then the option to extend shall be void and of no force of effect. If Tenant satisfies and complies with all of such conditions and elects to exercise the option to extend, the minimum rent shall be adjusted to Fair Market Rent for comparable buildings in the Seattle-Belltown area. Upon the Tenant exercising its option to renew, the parties will use good faith efforts to reach an agreement on what constitutes Fair Market Rent for the Extended Term. In no case shall the Fair Market Rent for the Extended Term be less than minimum rent for the last year of the Lease Term. If the parties are unable to agree upon Fair Market Rent after a thirty- (30) day period within which the parties shall attempt to negotiate such rent, the parties agree to submit the matter to binding arbitration with a single arbitrator in accordance with Washington law; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that the difference in Landlord's  determination of Fair Market Rent and that of Tenant's determination of market rent must vary more than five percent (5%) for any arbitration to apply. (If the difference is five percent (5%) or less, then the difference shall be split in half.) The arbitrator shall be a licensed real estate broker who has been active over the previous five (5) year period in the leasing of office spaces. If Landlord and Tenant are unable to agree on the arbitrator within ten (10) days after the election of the parties to determine Fair Market Rent by arbitration, each shall select a broker who shall be qualified under the same criteria set forth above, and so notify the other party in writing within ten (10) days after the end of such ten (10) day period. The two brokers so chosen by the parties shall then appoint the arbitrator within ten (10) days after the date of the appointment of the last appointed broker. If the two brokers so chosen by the parties are unable to agree on the arbitrator within such ten (10) day period, the arbitrator will be appointed by the director (or the equivalent) of the Seattle Office of the American Arbitration Association upon the application of either party. If either party fails to timely select its broker and so notify the other party in writing within the foregoing ten (10) day period, and the other party timely selects its broker, then the broker selected by the other party shall be the arbitrator for determining Fair Market Rent. Within thirty (30) days after the selection of the arbitrator, the arbitrator shall determine Fair Market Rent by selecting either the Fair Market Rent stated in Landlord's submission to the arbitrator or the Fair Market Rent stated in Tenant's submission. The arbitrator shall have no power to average such amounts or to designate a Fair Market Rent other than that specified in either Landlord's submission or Tenant's submission. Both parties may submit any information to the arbitrator for his or her consideration, with copies to the other party. The arbitrator shall have the right to consult experts and competent authorities for factual information or evidence pertaining to the determination of Fair Market Rent. The arbitrator shall render his or her decision by written notice to each party. The determination of the arbitrator will be final and binding upon Landlord and Tenant.
