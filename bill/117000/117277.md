 ORDINANCE _________________

 AN ORDINANCE relating to City employment; amending Seattle Municipal Code Section 4.34.055 to provide eligible employees breaks to express breast milk without deduction of pay or paid leave balances.

 WHEREAS, breastfeeding has been found to provide medical benefits to mothers and to infants, and to provide economic relief and other benefits to families; and

 WHEREAS, policymakers and medical organizations such as United States Surgeon General, the Center for Disease Control, and the World Health Organization, recognize the benefits of breastfeeding and encourage women to breastfeed into later infancy; and

 WHEREAS, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act amended the Fair Labor Standards Act to require employers to provide time and space for eligible employees to express breast milk, but does not require that such lactation breaks be paid; and

 WHEREAS, lack of accommodation in the workplace is one factor that prevents women from continuing to breastfeed their children throughout infancy; and

 WHEREAS, the City of Seattle seeks to support its employees and their families; NOW, THEREFORE,

 BE IT ORDAINED BY THE CITY OF SEATTLE AS FOLLOWS:

 Section 1. Seattle Municipal Code 4.34.055 shall be amended to read as follows:

 4.34.055 Use and scheduling of vacations((~~.~~))

 A. The minimum vacation allowance to be used by an employee shall be no more than ((~~one-half (~~))1/2((~~)~~)) day or, at the discretion of the appointing authority or his or her designated management representative, such lesser amount as may be deemed appropriate, but no less than ((~~fifteen (~~))15((~~)~~))minutes.

 B. The appointing authority shall arrange vacation time for employees on such schedules as shall least interfere with the functions of the employing unit.

 C. 1. An employee may, with the prior approval of the appointing authority or his or her designated management representative, go on unpaid leave of absence for a period of no more than ((~~twelve (~~))12((~~)~~)) months, without first using accrued vacation credit or compensatory time off. The appointing authority or his or her designated management representative may deny the use of vacation to an employee who has exhausted his or her sick leave balance and requests further paid leave for medical reasons.

 2. However, if an employee has City-provided long-term disability benefits and has accumulated a vacation, compensatory time, or sick leave balance in excess of that necessary to cover the long-term disability plan elimination period, he/she can choose either to receive the long-term disability benefits after the elimination period or to remain on vacation, compensatory time, or sick leave (with approval of the appointing authority or his or her designated management representative) until all such paid leave is exhausted and receive the appropriate long-term disability benefit.

 D. In the event that the City cancels an employee's already scheduled and approved vacation, leaving no time to reschedule such vacation before the employee's maximum balance will be reached, the appointing authority or his or her designated management representative may allow the employee to exceed the normal maximum vacation balance and to continue to accrue vacation credit above the normal maximum credit balance for three ((~~(3)~~)) months after such maximum has been reached. No similar exception shall be authorized for such employee until ((~~twelve (~~))12((~~)~~)) months after the appointing authority's authorization.

 E. Any employee receiving disability compensation pursuant to ((~~SMC~~)) Chapter 4.44 may exceed the normal maximum vacation balance until such time as the employee ceases to receive such disability compensation. If the employee returns to regular pay status upon discontinuance or exhaustion of such disability compensation, such employee's vacation balance may exceed the normal maximum vacation balance specified in ((~~SMC~~)) Section 4.34.020 B for three ((~~(3)~~)) months after the date of such employee's return; otherwise, the employee shall be paid in a lump sum for any unused vacation credit balance.

 F. Upon transfer, the employing unit receiving the employee shall grant any earned vacation due such employee at its expense, subject to the provisions set forth in this chapter.

 G. Employees who are eligible under the Fair Labor Standards Act to take breaks to express breast milk may do so without deduction of pay or paid leave balances, provided that such breaks are necessary to express milk and are of reasonable length and frequency.

 Section 2. This ordinance shall take effect and be in force 30 days after its approval by the Mayor, but if not approved and returned by the Mayor within ten days after presentation, it shall take effect as provided by Seattle Municipal Code Section 1.04.020.
