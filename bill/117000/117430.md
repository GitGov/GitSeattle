 2. Foster a sense of community by integrating new pedestrian-oriented ((~~multifamily~~)) development with the neighborhood street environment and promoting designs that allow easy surveillance of the street by area residents;

 3. Promote livability in multifamily areas by providing a sense of openness and access to light and air; and

 4. Encourage the compatibility of a variety of housing  and use  types , including limited nonresidential and mixed use development,  with the scale and character of neighborhoods where new ((~~multifamily~~)) development occurs.

 B. Application of provisions. The provisions of this Section 23.45.529 apply to all ((~~residential uses~~))  development  that do es  not undergo any type of design review pursuant to Chapter 23.41, except single-family dwelling units.

 Exhibit A for 23.45.529: Measurement of Street-facing Facades

 1. Facade openings.

 a. At least 20 percent of the area of each street-facing facade shall consist of windows and/or doors.

 b. Only transparent windows count toward the requirement for facade openings in this subsection 23.45.529.C.1. Windows composed of glass blocks or opaque glass, garage doors, and doors to utility and service areas, do not count.

 2. Facade articulation.

 a. If a street-facing facade or portion of a street-facing facade is not vertical, the Director shall determine whether the facade is substantially vertical and required to comply with this subsection 23.45.529.C.

 b. If the street-facing facade of a structure exceeds 750 square feet in area, division of the facade into separate facade planes is required (see Exhibit B for 23.45.529).

 Exhibit B for 23.45.529: Street-facing Facades

 c. In order to be considered a separate facade plane for the purposes of this subsection 23.45.529.C.2, a portion of the street-facing facade shall have a minimum area of 150 square feet and a maximum area of 500 square feet, and shall project or be recessed from abutting facade planes by a minimum depth of 18 inches.

 d. Trim that is a minimum of 0.75 inches deep and 3.5 inches wide is required to mark roof lines, porches, windows and doors on all street-facing facades.

 e. The Director may allow exceptions to the facade articulation requirements in this subsection 23.45.529.C.2, if the Director determines that the street- facing facade will meet the intent of subsection 23.45.529.A.1, and the intent of subsections 23.45.529.D.2, E.3, and F.4 for cottage housing developments, rowhouse developments, and townhouse developments, respectively, through one or more of the following street-facing facade treatments:

 1) Variations in building materials and/or color, or both, that reflect the stacking of stories or reinforce the articulation of the facade (s) ;

 2) Incorporation of architectural features that add interest and dimension to the facade, such as porches, bay windows, chimneys, pilasters, columns, cornices, and/or balconies;

 3) Special landscaping elements provided to meet Green Factor requirements pursuant to Section 23.45.524, such as trellises, that accommodate vegetated walls covering a minimum of 25 percent of the facade surface;

 4) Special fenestration treatment, including an increase in the percentage of windows and doors to at least 25 percent of the street-facing facade(s).

 ***

 Section 18. Section 23.47A.008 of the Seattle Municipal Code, which section was last amended by Ordinance 122935, is amended as follows:

 23.47A.008 Street-level development standards

 A. Basic street-level requirements.

 1. The provisions of this subsection apply to:

 a. Structures in NC zones;

 b. Structures that contain a residential use in C zones; and

 c. Structures in C zones across the street from residential zones.

 2. Blank facades.

 a. For purposes of this section, facade segments are considered blank if they do not include at least one of the following:

 1) Windows;

 2) Entryways or doorways;

 3) Stairs, stoops, or porticos;

 4) Decks or balconies; or

 5) Screening and landscaping on the facade itself.

 b. Blank segments of the street-facing facade between 2 feet and 8 feet

 above the sidewalk may not exceed 20 feet in width.

 c. The total of all blank facade segments may not exceed 40 percent of the width of the facade of the structure along the street.

 3. Street-level street-facing facades shall be located within 10 feet of the street lot line, unless wider sidewalks, plazas, or other approved landscaped or open spaces are provided.

 B. Nonresidential street - level requirements.

 1. The provisions of this subsection  23.47A.008.B  and subsection 23.47A.008.A apply to:

 a. Structures with street-level nonresidential uses in NC zones;

 b. Structures with street-level nonresidential uses that also contain residential uses in C zones; and

 c. Structures with street-level nonresidential uses in C zones across the

 street from residential zones.

 2. Transparency.

 a. Sixty percent of the street-facing facade between 2 feet and 8 feet above the sidewalk shall be transparent.

 b. Transparent areas of facades shall be designed and maintained to allow unobstructed views from the outside into the structure or, in the case of live-work units, into display windows that have a minimum 30-inch depth.

 3. ((~~The following h~~))  H eight and depth provisions ((~~apply to~~))  for  new structures or new additions to existing structures((~~:~~)) .  ((~~a.~~)) Nonresidential uses shall extend an average  depth  of at least 30 feet and a minimum  depth  of 15 feet ((~~in depth~~)) from the street-level street-facing facade. If the combination of the ((~~street-facing facade~~)) requirement s  of ((~~subsection~~))  Sections 23.47A.005 or  23.47A.008((~~.D.1~~)) and this depth requirement would result in a requirement that an area greater than 50 percent of the structure's footprint be dedicated to nonresidential use, the Director may modify the street-facing facade or depth requirements, or both, so that no more than 50 percent of the structure's footprint is required to be nonresidential.

 b. Nonresidential uses at street level shall have a floor-to-floor height of at least 13 feet.

 C. In pedestrian-designated zones, the provisions of subsections 23.47A . 008.A and 23.47A.008.B and the following apply:

 1. A minimum of 80 percent of the width of a structure's street-level street-facing facade that faces a principal pedestrian street shall be occupied by uses listed in  subsection 23.47A.005.D.1. The remaining 20 percent of the street frontage may contain other permitted uses and/or pedestrian entrances (see Exhibit A for 23.47A.008).

 Exhibit A for 23.47A.008

 2. For purposes of calculating the 80 percent of a structure's street-level facade, the width of a driveway at street level, not to exceed 22 feet, may be subtracted from the width of the street-facing facade if the access cannot be provided from an alley or from a street that is not a designated principal pedestrian street.

 3. If the street-facing facade and depth requirements would result in a requirement that an area greater than 50 percent of the structure's footprint be dedicated to the uses in subsection 23.47A.005.D.1, the Director may modify the street-facing facade or depth requirements, or both, so that no more than 50 percent of the structure's footprint is required to be dedicated to the uses in subsection 23.47A.005.D.1.

 D. ((~~The provisions of this subsection apply to structures with residential uses located along a street-level street-facing facade~~))  Where ((~~1. R~~)) r esidential uses are ((~~limited to 20% of the~~))  located along a  street-level street-facing facade ((~~under section 23.47.005.D;~~))  the following requirements apply unless exempted by subsection 23.47A.008.G:

 1.  ((~~2.~~)) At least one of the street-level street-facing facades containing a residential use shall have a visually prominent pedestrian entry; and

 2. ((~~3.~~)) The floor of a dwelling unit located along the street-level street-facing facade shall be at least 4 feet above or 4 feet below sidewalk grade or be set back at least 10 feet from the sidewalk.

 F. The Director may allow departures from street-level requirements of this section for projects that are not subject to the Design Review process, as a Type I decision, if the Director determines that the project will maintain the safety and aesthetics of the streetscape for pedestrians and will:

 1. maintain pedestrian access to the structure;

 2. maintain urban form consistent with adjacent structures;

 3. maintain the visibility of nonresidential uses;

 4. maintain the privacy of residential uses; or

 5. allow the continued use of an existing structure without substantial renovation.

 G. In a structure existing on January 1, 2012, an accessory dwelling unit may be established if it is accessory to an existing dwelling unit and if it meets minimum housing standards of Chapter 22.206, even if nonconforming to standards of subsection 23.47A.008.D.

 Section 19. A new Subchapter II and a new Section 23.52.008 are added to Chapter 23.52 of the Seattle Municipal Code as follows:

(1) Required parking for spectator sports facilities or exhibition halls must be available when the facility or exhibition hall is in use. A facility shall be considered to be "in use" during the period beginning three hours before an event is scheduled to begin and ending one hour after a scheduled event is expected to end. For sports events of variable or uncertain duration, the expected event length shall be the average length of the events of the same type for which the most recent data are available, provided it is within the past five years. During an inaugural season, or for nonrecurring events, the best available good faith estimate of event duration will be used. A facility will not be deemed to be "in use" by virtue of the fact that administrative or maintenance personnel are present. The Director may reduce the required parking for any event when projected attendance for a spectator sports facility is certified to be 50 percent or less of the facility's seating capacity, to an amount not less than that required for the certified projected attendance, at the rate of one space for each ten fixed seats of certified projected attendance. An application for reduction and the certification shall be submitted to the Director at least 15 days prior to the event. When the event is one of a series of similar events, such certification may be submitted for the entire series 15 days prior to the first event in the series. If the Director finds that a certification of projected attendance of 50 percent or less of the seating capacity is based on satisfactory evidence such as past attendance at similar events or advance ticket sales, the Director shall, within 15 days of such submittal, notify the facility operator that a reduced parking requirement has been approved, with any conditions deemed appropriate by the Director to ensure adequacy of parking if expected attendance should change. The parking requirement reduction may be applied for only if the goals of the facility's Transportation Management Plan are otherwise being met. The Director may revoke or modify a parking requirement reduction approval during a series, if projected attendance is exceeded.

(2)The amount of required parking is calculated based on the maximum number of staff or animals the center is designed to accommodate.

(3) The general requirements of lines A through H of Table A for (( Section )) 23.54.015 is superseded to the extent that a use, structure or development qualifies for either a greater or a lesser parking requirement (which may include no requirement) under any other provision. To the extent that a nonresidential use fits within more than one line in Table A for (( Section )) 23.54.015, the least of the applicable parking requirements applies. The different parking requirements listed for certain categories of nonresidential uses shall not be construed to create separate uses for purposes of any requirements related to establishing or changing a use under this Title 23.

(2) For development within single-family zones the Director may waive some or all of the parking requirements according to Section 23.44.015 as a special or reasonable accommodation. In other zones, if the applicant can demonstrate that less parking is needed to provide a special or reasonable accommodation, the Director may reduce the requirement. The Director shall specify the parking required and link the parking reduction to the features of the program that allow such reduction. The parking reductions shall be valid only under the conditions specified, and if the conditions change, the standard requirements shall be met.

(3) Notice of Income Restrictions. Prior to issuance of any permit to establish, construct or modify any use or structure, or to reduce any parking accessory to a multifamily residential use, if the applicant relies upon these reduced parking requirements, the applicant shall record in the King County Recorder a declaration signed and acknowledged by the owner(s), in a form prescribed by the Director, which shall identify the subject property by legal description, and shall acknowledge and provide notice to any prospective purchasers that specific income limits are a condition for maintaining the reduced parking requirement.

The Director, in consultation with the Director of Transportation, may allow adult care and child care centers locating in existing structures to provide loading and unloading spaces on-street when no other alternative exists.

(2) The amount of required parking is calculated based on the maximum number of staff, children, or clients that the center is designed to accommodate on site at any one time.

(3) A child care facility, when co-located with an assisted living facility, may count the passenger load/unload space required for the assisted living facility toward its required passenger load/unload spaces.

(4) When family support centers are located within community centers owned and operated by the Department of Parks and Recreation, the Director may lower the combined parking requirement by up to a maximum of 15 percent, pursuant to (( Section )) subsection 23.54.020.I.

(5) Indoor gymnasiums are not considered ball courts, nor are they considered auditoria or public assembly rooms unless they contain bleachers (fixed seats). If the gymnasium contains bleachers, the parking requirement for the gymnasium is one parking space for every eight fixed seats. Each 20 inches of width of bleachers is counted as one fixed seat for the purposes of determining parking requirements. If the gymnasium does not contain bleachers and is in a school, there is no parking requirement for the gymnasium. If the gymnasium does not contain bleachers and is in a community center, the parking requirement is one space for each 350 square feet.

(6) When a library is permitted in a single-family zone as a conditional use, the Director may modify the parking requirements pursuant to Section 23.44.022; when a library is permitted in a multifamily zone as a conditional use, the Director may modify the parking requirements pursuant to Section 23.45.122; and when a library is permitted in a commercial zone, the Director may modify the parking requirements according to (( Section )) subsection 23.44.022.L.

(7) For public schools, when an auditorium or other place of assembly is demolished and a new one built in its place, parking requirements are determined based on the new construction. When an existing public school on an existing public school site is remodeled, additional parking is required if any auditorium or other place of assembly is expanded or additional fixed seats are added. Additional parking is required as shown on Table C for 23.54.015 for the increase in floor area or increase in number of seats only. If the parking requirement for the increased area or seating is 10 percent or less than that for the existing auditorium or other place of assembly, then no additional parking is required.

 Section 21. Section 23.54.016 of the Seattle Municipal Code, which section was last amended by Ordinance 122311, is amended as follows:

 23.54.016 Major Institutions---Parking and transportation((~~.~~))

 Major Institution uses are subject to the following transportation and parking requirements:

 A. General Provisions.

 1. Minimum requirements for parking quantity are established in subsection  23.54.016. B ((~~of this section~~)).

 2. The maximum number of spaces provided for the Major Institution use shall not exceed ((~~one hundred thirty-five (~~))135((~~)~~)) percent of the minimum requirement, ((~~except~~))  unless additional spaces are approved  through administrative or Council review as provided in subsection  23.54.016. C ((~~of this section~~)).  For a Major Institution use in an urban center or the Station Area Overlay District, the maximum limit shall not exceed 135 percent of the minimum parking requirements calculated pursuant to subsection 23.54.016.B.2.

 3. Parking requirements for Major Institutions with more than one ((~~(1)~~)) type of institutional use (for example, a hospital and a university),  if applicable,  shall be calculated for each use separately, and then added together to derive the total number of required spaces.

 4. When a permit application is made for new development at an existing Major Institution  that is not located in an urban center or the Station Area Overlay District , parking requirements shall be calculated both for the entire Major Institution and for the proposed new development. If there is a parking deficit for the entire institution, the institution shall make up a portion of the deficit in addition to the quantity required for the new development, according to the provisions of subsection  23.54.016. B .3 ((~~5 of this section~~)). If there is a parking surplus((~~,~~)) above the maximum allowed number of spaces((~~,~~)) for the institution as a whole, ((~~requirements~~))  required amounts of parking  for new development will first be applied to the surplus in the required ratio of long-term and short-term spaces. Additional parking shall be permitted only when no surplus remains.

 ***

 4. Through the process of reviewing a new or updated transportation management program in conjunction with reviewing a master plan, the Council may approve in excess of ((~~one hundred thirty-five (~~))135((~~)~~)) percent of the minimum requirements for long-term parking spaces, or may increase or decrease the required ((~~fifty (~~))50((~~)~~)) percent SOV goal, based upon the Major Institution's impacts on traffic and opportunities for alternative means of transportation. Factors to be considered shall include, but not be limited to:

 a. Proximity to a street with ((~~fifteen (~~))15((~~)~~)) minute transit service headway in each direction;

 b. Air quality conditions in the vicinity of the Major Institution;

 c. The absence of other nearby traffic generators and the level of existing and future traffic volumes in and through the surrounding area;

 d. The patterns and peaks of traffic generated by Major Institution uses and the availability or lack of on- street parking opportunities in the surrounding area;

 e. The impact of additional parking on the Major Institution site;

 f. The extent to which the scheduling of classes or work shifts reduces the transportation alternatives available to employees and/or students or the presence of limited carpool opportunities due to the small number of employees; and

 g. The extent to which the Major Institution has demonstrated a commitment to SOV alternatives.

 5. The provision of short-term parking spaces in excess of ((~~one hundred thirty-five (~~))135((~~)~~)) percent of the minimum requirements established in subsection  23.54.016. B . 2 ((~~of this section~~)) may be permitted by the Director through preparation or update of a Transportation Management Program. In evaluating whether to allow more than ((~~one hundred thirty-five (~~))135((~~)~~)) percent of the minimum, the Director, in consultation with  the Director of  ((~~Seattle Department of~~)) Transportation ((~~and~~~~Metropolitan King County~~)), shall consider evidence of parking demand and opportunities for alternative means of transportation. Factors to be considered shall include but are not necessarily limited to the criteria contained in subsection  23.54.015. D .1.b  ((~~of this section~~)) and the following:

 a. The nature of services provided by Major Institution uses which generate short-term parking demand; and

 b. The extent to which the Major Institution manages short-term parking to ensure its availability to meet short-term parking needs.

 Based on this review, the Director shall determine the amount of additional short-term parking to be permitted, if any.

This distance will be the walking distance measured from the nearest transit stop to the lot line of the lot containing the use.~~

~~b. In industrial zones, the minimum parking requirement for a nonresidential use is reduced by 15 percent if the use is located within 1,320 feet of a street with peak transit service headways of 15 minutes or less. This distance will be the walking distance measured from the nearest transit stop to the lot line of the lot containing the use.~~))

 ((~~3.~~)) 2.  For new or expanding offices or manufacturing uses that require 40 or more parking spaces, the minimum parking requirement may be reduced by up to a maximum of 40 percent by the substitution of alternative transportation programs, according to the following provisions:

 a. For every ((~~certified~~)) carpool space accompanied by a cash fee, performance bond or alternative guarantee acceptable to the Director, the total parking requirement will be reduced by 1.9 spaces, up to a maximum of 40 percent of the parking requirement. ((~~The Director will consult with the Director of the Seattle Department of~~~~Transportation in certifying carpool spaces and the location of carpool parking.~~))

 b. For every ((~~certified~~)) vanpool purchased or leased by the applicant for

 employee use, or equivalent cash fee for purchase of a van by the public ridesharing agency, the total parking requirement will be reduced by six spaces, up to a maximum of 20 percent of the parking requirement. ((~~Before a certificate of occupancy may be issued, details of the vanpool program shall be specified in a Memorandum of Agreement executed between the proponent, the Director, and the Director of the Seattle Department of Transportation.~~))

 c. If transit or transportation passes are provided with a 50 percent or greater cost reduction to all employees in a proposed structure for the duration of the business establishment(s) within it, or five years, whichever is less, and if transit service is located within 800 feet, the parking requirement shall be reduced by 10 percent. With a 25 percent to 49 percent cost reduction, and if transit service is located within 800 feet, the parking requirement shall be reduced by 5 percent.

 d. For every four covered bicycle parking spaces provided, the total parking requirement shall be reduced by one space, up to a maximum of 5 percent of the parking requirement, provided that there is access to an arterial over improved streets.
