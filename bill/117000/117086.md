 AN ORDINANCE relating to the King Street Station; authorizing the Director of the Department of Transportation to execute and grant to Puget Sound Energy a non-exclusive perpetual easement over, under, along, across, and through a portion of the property known as the King Street Station located at 303 South Jackson Street.

 WHEREAS, for over 100 years King Street Station has served as a gateway for millions of travelers coming into Seattle and the Pacific Northwest and is one of three multi-modal transportation hubs in the City Center; and

 WHEREAS, King Street Station was added to the National Registry of Historic Landmarks and the Washington Heritage Register in 1973 thereby preserving this landmark a priority for the City of Seattle as well as ensuring it remains a critical transportation gateway into Seattle and transforming it into a modern transit hub; and

 WHEREAS, in 2008 the City purchased King Street Station from BNSF Railway Company for $10.00 as authorized by Ordinance 122312 for the purposes of restoring and preserving the station; and

 WHEREAS, key elements of this restoration involves updating aging mechanical, electrical, and plumbing systems, and adding a new gas line to make the station more energy efficient and sustainable; and
