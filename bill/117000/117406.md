 WHEREAS, the City of Seattle Police Department will administer the grant award on behalf of the City of Seattle and King County; and

 WHEREAS, the City is not obligated to continue or maintain grant funding levels for the JAG Program once grant funds have lapsed; and

 WHEREAS, pursuant to the terms of the grant whereby the City is to distribute grant funds to co-applicants, the City intends to transfer some of the JAG Program funds it receives to its co-applicant; and

 WHEREAS, King County should not anticipate the City will assume responsibility for any program costs funded by the JAG Program once the funds are spent; and

 WHEREAS, the City Council wishes to increase an appropriation in the 2012 Adopted Budget for the Police Department to reflect the anticipated receipt and authorize the expenditure of these JAG Program funds; NOW, THEREFORE,

These funds are hereby accepted and shall be deposited into the fund named in Section 2 to reimburse the appropriation made in Section 2. The Mayor or his designee is further authorized to execute and deliver documents relating to the agreements if required by federal guidelines.

 Section 2. To carry out the purpose of the agreements authorized in Section 1, and contingent upon the execution of those agreements, and in order to meet actual necessary expenditures of the City for which insufficient appropriations have been made due to causes that could not reasonably have been foreseen at the time of the making of the 2012 Budget, the appropriation for the following in the 2012 Budget is increased as follows:
