 Grantor: The City of Seattle

 Grantee: State of Washington through the Recreation and Conservation Funding Board

 Abbreviated Legal Description: lots 18 through 27, inclusive, Blk 85, Replat of West Seattle Land & Improvement Company's Third Plat, v. 9, pg. 58, in King County, WA

 Tax Parcel Numbers: 9275702865, 9275702885, 9275702905, 9275702915

 The Grantor enters this Deed for and in consideration of monies coming in whole or in part from the Urban Wildlife Account. Such grant is made pursuant to the project agreement entered into between the Grantor and the Grantee entitled Cheasty G.B/N.A./Mt. View N.A.: RCO #91 246 A, signed by the Grantor on October 16, 1991 and by the Grantee on September 30, 1991 and supporting materials, which are on file with the Grantor and the Grantee in connection with the project agreement.

 The Grantor hereby conveys and grants to the Grantee as the representative of the people of the State, the right to enforce the following duties:

 1. The Grantor shall take such reasonable and feasible measures as are necessary to protect the Real Property as described in Exhibit A: Legal Description, in perpetuity. Such measures shall be consistent with the purposes in the project agreement, including protecting, preserving, restoring and/or enhancing the habitat functions on the Real Property, which includes forested habitat. This habitat supports or may support priority species.

 2. The Grantor shall allow public access to the Property as provided in the project agreement. Such access shall be subject to the restrictions allowed under the project agreement, by written agreement with the Grantee, or under state law. This provision is not intended to prevent reasonable access or use restrictions that are necessary for safe and effective management of the property consistent with habitat conservation purposes and the project agreement.

 3. The Grantor shall provide access by the Grantee to inspect the Real Property for compliance with the terms of this Deed and the applicable project agreement to which the Grantor is a signatory. Such access shall be subject to the restrictions, if any, allowed under the project agreement, by written agreement with the Grantee, or under state law. The Grantor warrants it has and shall maintain the legal right and means to reach the property.

 4. Without prior written consent by the Grantee or its successors, through an amendment to the project agreement or the process set forth below, the Grantor shall not use or allow any use of the Real Property (including any part of it) that is inconsistent with the conservation purposes herein granted and as stated in the project agreement. The Grantor shall also not grant or suffer the creation of any property interest that is inconsistent with the conservation purposes herein granted and as stated in the project agreement.

 Grantee's consent to an inconsistent use or property interest under this Deed shall be granted only to the extent permitted by law and upon the following three conditions, which ensure the substitution of other eligible land. The conditions are: (1) the substitute conservation land must be of reasonably equivalent habitat qualities, characteristics and location for the conservation purposes as the Real Property prior to any inconsistent use; (2) the substitute conservation land must be of at least equal fair market value to the Real Property at the time of Grantee's consent to the inconsistent use; and (3) the fair market value of the Real Property at the time of the Grantee's consent to the inconsistent use shall not take into consideration any encumbrances imposed on or alterations made to that land as a result of the original state grant and other grants if such encumbrances or alterations reduce the value of the Real Property from what it would be without them.

 For purposes of this Deed the project agreement includes any amendments thereto that occur prior to or subsequent to the execution of this Deed.

 This Deed contains covenants running with the land and shall be binding upon the Grantor, its successors and assigns, and upon any person acquiring the Property, or any portion thereof, or any interest therein, including a leasehold interest, whether by operation of law or otherwise. If the Grantor sells all or any portion of its interest, the new owner of the Property or any portion thereof (including, without limitation, any owner who acquires its interest by foreclosure, trustee's sale or otherwise) shall be subject to applicable covenants and requirements under the Deed.

 This Deed may not be removed or altered from the Real Property unless specific approval has been granted by the Washington State Recreation and Conservation Office and/or the Washington State Recreation and Conservation Funding Board or its successors.

 The Washington State Recreation and Conservation Office and the Recreation and Conservation Funding Board and/or its successors shall each have a separate and independent right to enforce the terms of this deed.
