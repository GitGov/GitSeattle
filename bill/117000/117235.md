 6. In areas where the underlying zoning is NC3P((~~/~~)) 65, all floor area (( in residential use)) on a lot that is 8,000 square feet or less in area and has been either vacant or in parking use since February 27, 1995.

 Section 7. Section 23.73.010 of the Seattle Municipal Code, which section was last amended by Ordinance 123392, is amended as follows:

 23.73.010 ((~~Development standards~~))  Floor size limits outside the Conservation Core

 A. Floor size limit.  The following provisions apply to lots located outside the boundaries of the Conservation Core identified on Map A for 23.73.010.

 1. On lots greater than 15,000 square feet in size, the maximum gross floor area of any single story above 35 feet in height is 15,000 square feet. The floor size limit ((~~shall~~))  does  not apply to non-residential uses in a structure developed on a lot ((~~pursuant~~))  according  to subsection 23.73.009.B.2.

 2. On a lot with more than one structure that exceeds 35 feet in height,  the floor size limit applies to the portions of each structure above 35 feet in height.

 3. On a lot where ((~~or~~)) more than one portion of the same structure exceeds 35 feet in height, the floor size limit ((~~shall apply~~)) applies  to each portion  of the structure above 35 feet in height. ((~~A minimum separation of 40 feet is required at all points between separate portions of a structure above 35 feet in height on the same lot, except that separation between a new structure and an existing structure located on the same lot is not required. Where~~)) If  the separation between portions of a structure above 35 feet in height is less than 40 feet, the floor area of each story in the separated portions of the structure shall be combined to determine the floor area subject to the floor size limit.

 ((~~3~~)) 4 .  If new structures on the same or abutting lots have internal connections above the first story, the connected structures are considered to be a single structure for the purpose of calculating the floor area subject to the floor size limit,  ((~~Internal connections above 35 feet in height between new portions of a structure on the same lot and between separate structures on abutting lots are not permitted,~~)) unless the structure ((~~on the abutting lot~~))  to which the connection is made  is a character structure.

 ((~~4~~)) 5 . For a project that retains ((~~the whole of a~~))  an entire  character structure on the lot, any floor area above 35 feet in height within the character structure, whether connected to a new structure or not, is not included in the calculation of the floor area subject to the limit on floor size.

 Map A for 23.73.010: Pike/Pine Conservation Core

 B. Exceptions to floor size limit.

 1.  For a structure with a minimum of 50 percent of the total gross floor area in residential use, the Director may permit, as a Type I decision, an increase in the floor size limit  of up to 15 percent on lots with an area of 30,000 square feet or less, not counting any area occupied by a character structure, to allow additional development flexibility to promote neighborhood conservation objectives and design that minimizes the overall appearance of the project's bulk . ((~~, provided that no~~))  No  increase in floor size is permitted for a project that will result in the demolition of a character structure. ((~~On a lot with an area of 30,000 square feet or less, not counting any area occupied by a character structure, the limit on floor size above 35 feet in height may be increased by 15 percent~~))  In order for a structure to qualify for an increase in floor size area  ((~~if~~)) one or more of the following conditions ((~~apply~~))  must exist :

 ((~~1~~)) a . Conditions in the vicinity of the lot minimize the impact of additional development bulk on the existing character of the area. Such conditions include locations on the edges of the Pike/Pine Conservation Overlay District where development on large lots already exists, or where irregularities in the street grid have created small blocks or a single lot surrounded on all sides by streets; or

 ((~~2~~)) b . The proposed new project includes features that offset the perceived scale of development, such as a landscaped courtyard that is visible from the sidewalk and located primarily at street level on a street that is not a principal pedestrian street; or

 ((~~3~~)) c . The increase in floor size is for a mixed - use project that includes uses contributing to the area's recognized character as an arts district, including performing arts space and artist live/work space, ((~~which~~))  that  typically have design requirements((~~,~~)) such as ((~~non-standard~~))  nonstandard  floor - to - ceiling heights((~~,~~)) that reduce the total amount of usable floor area in a structure; or

 ((~~4~~)) d . The additional floor area will facilitate development of housing that is affordable to and occupied by "income-eligible households," as defined in Section 23.58A.004, for a minimum of 50 percent of the total gross floor area of the project and is subject to covenants ensuring that the housing remains available to these households for a minimum of 50 years.

 ((~~C~~)) 2 . Retaining character structures on a lot. A 25 percent increase in the floor size limit ((~~above 35 feet in height~~)) is permitted for projects that incorporate a character structure on the same lot, either as a whole structure or as a portion of a structure, ((~~pursuant~~))  according  to the following provisions.

 ((~~1~~)) a . No increase in floor size is permitted under the provisions of this subsection  23.73.010.B.2  for a project that will result in the demolition of a designated Seattle ((~~Landmark~~)) landmark,  or  of a character structure ((~~identified on Table A for 23.73.010~~))  listed in a rule promulgated by the Director according to Section 23.73.005.

 ((~~2~~)) b. One character structure must be retained for each new structure or portion of a structure that is subject to the floor size limit in order for the new structure or portion of a structure to qualify for the 25 percent increase in floor size.

 c. For a project that incorporates portions of a character structure, the following conditions shall be met:

 ((~~a~~)) 1)  All street - facing facades of the character structure are retained;

 ((~~b~~)) 2)  All portions of the new structure above the height of the street - facing facades of the character structure are set back a minimum of 15 feet from all street property lines that abut the character structure; and

 ((~~c~~)) 3)  The original floor-to-ceiling height of the ground story is maintained.

 ((~~3~~)) d . Any floor area in a new portion of the structure above 35 feet in height that is within the area of the original footprint of the character structure and is separated from the street along all street frontages by the original facades of the character structure is not included in the calculation of the floor area subject to the floor size limit.

 ((~~4~~)) e . A project that is granted an increase in floor size under the provisions of this subsection 23.73.010.((~~C~~)) B.2  shall maintain the character structure, or portions of the character structure, both interior and exterior, in good condition and repair and in a manner that preserves unique features and characteristics for the life of the project. Any increase in floor size permitted ((~~pursuant~~))  according to this ((~~Section~~))  subsection  23.73.010.((~~C~~)) B.2  shall not be combined with any increase in floor size permitted ((~~pursuant~~))  according  to Section 23.73.010.B .1 .

 3. A 25 percent increase in the floor size limit is permitted on the receiving site of a project that adds floor area through the use of TDP as permitted by Section 23.73.024, provided that the amount of floor area added through the use of TDP is equivalent to at least 0.25 FAR, as calculated for the receiving site.

 Section 12. A new Section 23.73.024 of the Seattle Municipal Code is enacted as follows:

 23.73.024 Transfer of development potential

 A. General Standards for the transfer of development potential (TDP) within the Pike/Pine Conservation Overlay District.

 1. For a lot located in an NC3P 65 zone within the Pike/Pine Conservation Overlay District shown on Map A for 23.73.004, excluding the area within the Conservation Core shown on Map A for 23.73.010, an applicant may use transferable development potential to obtain one or both of the following:

 a. Additional residential and live-work unit floor area above the maximum FAR limit for a mixed use structure in subsection 23.47A.013; or

 b. A height exception to allow an additional 10 feet above the 65-foot height limit.

 2. Development potential may not be transferred from one lot to another except as allowed by this Chapter 23.73.

 3. Development potential may be transferred from eligible sending lots meeting the conditions of subsection 23.73.024.C to locations outside the Pike/Pine Conservation Overlay District if TDP transfer to specifically-identified areas or lots is authorized by City ordinance.

 B. Standards for character structure TDP receiving sites. A lot must meet the following conditions in order to be eligible to achieve extra residential floor area through TDP:

 1. Character structure TDP receiving sites shall be located outside the Conservation Core identified on Map A for Section 23.73.010.

 2. Development of the receiving site shall not result in the demolition or significant alteration of a character structure or a designated landmark. For purposes of this Section 23.73.024, significant alteration of a character structure means:

 a. For character structures that are not designated landmarks:

 1) Alteration of the exterior facades of the character structure, except alterations that restore the facades to their original condition;

 2) Alteration of the floor-to-ceiling height of the street level story, except alterations that restore the floor-to-ceiling height to its original condition; or

 3) The addition of stories to the character structure, unless the proposed addition is no taller than the maximum height to which the character structure was originally built.

 b. For character structures that are designated landmarks, if the Landmarks Preservation Board grants a Certificate of Approval for an alteration, the alteration is not considered significant.

 3. An additional 10 feet in height above the height limit of the zone is permitted on TDP receiving sites.

 4. All floor area above the FAR limit and above 65 feet in height shall be achieved through the use of TDP.

 4. Floor area gained through the use of TDP shall be for residential and live-work unit use only.

 5. For a structure that achieves an increase in height through the use of TDP, the minimum street level floor- to-ceiling height shall be 13 feet.

 6. TDP required before construction. No permit after the first building permit, and in any event no permit for construction activity other than excavating or shoring, and no permit for occupying existing floor area by any use based on TDP; will be issued for development that includes TDP until the applicant has demonstrated possession of TDP to the Director's satisfaction.

 C. Standards for Sending Sites.

 1. TDP sending sites shall be located in an NC3P zone within the Pike/Pine Conservation Overlay District, excluding NC3P zones with an MIO-105 overlay, and shall contain one of the following structures; provided that character structures on the proposed TDP sending site have not been demolished, or significantly altered as defined in subsection 23.73.024.B.2, since the effective date of this ordinance:

 a. One or more structures designated wholly or in part as a landmark under Chapter 25.12 or its predecessor ordinance; or

 c. Any character structure.

 2. Maximum transferable floor area.

 a. The maximum amount of floor area that may be transferred from an eligible sending site with a character structure that is not a designated landmark is the product of the eligible lot area of the sending site, times the maximum FAR for structures containing both residential and nonresidential uses as prescribed in Section 23.47A.013, minus the sum of any chargeable gross floor area on the sending site under the zoning in effect at the time a complete application transferring TDP is accepted and any TDP previously transferred from the sending site.

 b. The maximum amount of floor area that may be transferred from an eligible sending site with a designated landmark is the amount calculated in subsection 23.73.024.C.2.a multiplied by two.

 c. For purposes of this subsection 23.73.024.C.2, the eligible lot area is the total area of the sending site at the date that the character structure was built.

 3. Rehabilitation and maintenance of character structures. Character structures located on a TDP sending site shall be rehabilitated and maintained to comply with applicable codes and shall have a minimum useful life of at least 50 years from the time the TDP transfer is approved by the Director. If the TDP is proposed to be transferred prior to completing rehabilitation work necessary to satisfy this subsection 23.73.024.C, the Director may require as a condition of the transfer that a security be deposited with the City in an amount determined by the Director to ensure that the work is completed.

 4. Significant alteration, as defined in subsection 23.73.024.B.2, of the character structures on a TDP sending site is not permitted for at least 50 years from the time of the TDP transfer.

 D. TDP Deeds and Agreements.

 1. The fee owners of the TDP sending site shall execute a deed, and shall obtain the release of the TDP from all liens of record and the written consent of all holders of encumbrances on the sending lot other than easements and restrictions, unless the requirement for a release or consent is waived by the Director for good cause. The deed shall be recorded in the King County real property records. If TDP is conveyed to the owner of a TDP receiving site described in the deed, then unless otherwise expressly stated in the deed or any subsequent instrument conveying the lot or the TDP, the TDP shall pass with the receiving site whether or not a structure using the TDP shall have been permitted or built prior to any conveyance of the receiving site. Any subsequent conveyance of TDP previously conveyed to a receiving site shall require the written consent of all parties holding any interest in or lien on the receiving site from which the conveyance is made. If the TDP is transferred other than directly from the sending site to the receiving site using the TDP; then after the initial transfer all subsequent transfers shall also be by deed, duly executed, acknowledged, and recorded, each deed referring by King County recording number to the prior deed.

 2. Any person may purchase TDP that is eligible for transfer by complying with this Section 23.73.024, whether or not the purchaser is a permit applicant to develop real property or the owner of potential receiving site. Any TDP purchaser, including any successor or assignee, may use TDP on a receiving site to the extent that using TDP is permitted under the Land Use Code provisions applicable at the time the project intended to use the TDP vests, according to Section 23.76.026. The Director may require, as a condition of processing any permit application using TDP, that the owner of the receiving site demonstrate that the TDP has been validly transferred of record to the receiving site, and that the receiving site owner has recorded in the real estate records a notice stating that a permit application using TDP has been filed and the TDP to be used on the receiving site is not available for retransfer.

 3. As a condition to the effective transfer of TDP from a designated landmark, except from a City-owned sending site, the fee owner of the sending site shall execute and record an agreement running with the land, in form and content acceptable to, and accepted in writing by, the Director of Neighborhoods; providing for the rehabilitation and maintenance of the historically-significant or other relevant features of the structure or structures on the lot and acknowledging the restrictions on future development resulting from the transfer. The Director may require evidence that each lien holder has effectively subordinated the lien to the terms of the agreement, and that any holders of interests in the property have agreed to its terms. To the extent that a landmark structure on the sending site, the presence of which is a condition to eligibility to transfer TDP under the provisions of the zone, requires restoration or rehabilitation for the long-term preservation of the structure or its historically or architecturally-significant features, the Director of Neighborhoods may require as a condition to acceptance of the necessary agreement that the owner of the sending site apply for and obtain a certificate of approval from the Landmarks Preservation Board for the necessary work, or post security satisfactory to the Director of Neighborhoods for the completing the restoration or rehabilitation.

 E. Reservation in Deed. Any TDP eligible for transfer may instead be reserved in the conveyance of title to an eligible sending site by the express terms of the deed or other instrument of conveyance reserving a specified amount of TDP, provided that an instrument acceptable to the Director is recorded binding the sending site to the terms and conditions for eligibility to send TDP under this Section 23.73.024. Any TDP so reserved shall be considered transferred from that site and later may be conveyed by deed without participation of the owner of the site.

 F. Any agreement governing the use or development of the sending site shall provide that its covenants or conditions run with the land and shall be specifically enforceable by the City.

 G. The eligibility of a sending site to transfer TDP and the amount transferable from a sending site, shall be determined as of the date of transfer from the sending site and shall not be affected by the date of any application, permit decision, or other action for any project seeking to use TDP.

 Section 13. Section 23.84A.038 of the Seattle Municipal Code, which section was last amended by Ordinance 123649, is amended to add a definition, to be inserted in alphabetical order, as follows:

 23.84A.038 "T"

 "TDP" or "transferable development potential" means base residential floor area measured in square feet that may be transferred from one lot to another according to provisions of the zone where the lots are located.

 Section 14. This ordinance shall take effect and be in force thirty (30) days from and after its approval by the Mayor, but if not approved and returned by the Mayor within ten (10) days after presentation, it shall take effect as provided by Municipal Code Section 1.04.020.
