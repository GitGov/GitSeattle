 BE IT ORDAINED BY THE CITY OF SEATTLE AS FOLLOWS:

 Section 1. A new Section 11.14.203 of the Seattle Municipal Code is added as follows:

 11.14.203 Festival Street

 "Festival street" means a public place or portion of a public place that has been designated by the Director of Transportation for recurring temporary closure to vehicular traffic use for the purpose of pedestrian-oriented special activities, as established by the Director of Transportation.

 Section 2. A new Section 11.14.447 of the Seattle Municipal Code is added as follows:

 11.14.447 Pedestrian Plaza

 "Pedestrian plaza" means a public place or portion of a public place that has been designated by ordinance entirely for use by pedestrians, which may vary in size and shape; may abut a street or sidewalk; may be separated from roadways used for vehicular travel by curbs, bollards, or other barriers; may be surfaced with special materials and markings; and may contain landscaping, bicycle parking, bicycle storage facilities, public art, benches, tables, chairs, or other facilities for pedestrian use. Pedestrian plazas are a form of pedestrian mall authorized by RCW 35.71.

 Section 3. The City hereby adopts and authorizes the establishment of Festival Street and Pedestrian Plaza programs to be implemented and administered by the Director of Seattle Department of Transportation (the Director). The Director may promulgate rules to implement these separate programs. The festival street rule may address the festival street designation process, allowable activities or uses, the term or duration of the activity, permit requirements, mapping of designated festival streets, and other subjects the Director believes may aid in the implementation of the Festival Street program. The pedestrian plaza rule may address the pedestrian plaza recommendation and designation process, maintenance, funding, and other subjects the Director believes may aid in the implementation of the Pedestrian Plaza program.

 A. Festival Street Program. Community groups, businesses, or individuals that wish to participate in the Festival Street program shall submit applications to SDOT on forms developed for that purpose. SDOT shall process the applications for proposals to designate a festival street. A festival street must be designated before a Street Use Festival Street Use permit can be issued for that site. SDOT shall coordinate, review, and issue Street Use Festival Street permits, and verify that on-going activities conform to the conditions of the Street Use Festival Street permit. Permittees shall promptly notify SDOT of any material changes in their activities or operations that might affect their compliance with the conditions of the Street Use Festival Street permit.

 B. Pedestrian Plaza Program. When the Director determines that it would be in the public interest to create a pedestrian plaza, the Director shall make a recommendation for a pedestrian plaza designation to City Council. The designation of a pedestrian plaza shall be by Council approved ordinance, based on the recommendation of the Director, pursuant to the provisions and requirements of RCW 35.71.

 Section 4. Section 3.12.030 of the Seattle Municipal Code, last amended by Ordinance 121420, is amended as follows:
