 BE IT ORDAINED BY THE CITY OF SEATTLE AS FOLLOWS:

 Section 1.

 A. The Official Land Use Map, Chapter 23.32 of the Seattle Municipal Code, is amended as follows:

 1. All areas designated on Attachment B as Lowrise Duplex/Triplex (LDT) are rezoned to Lowrise 1 (LR1).

 2. All areas designated on Attachment B as Lowrise 1 (L1) that are located outside of urban centers, urban villages, and station area overlay districts are rezoned to LR1.

 3. All areas designated on Attachment B as Lowrise 1 (L1) that are located within urban centers, urban villages, and station area overlay districts are rezoned to Lowrise 2 (LR2).

 4. All areas designated on Attachment B as Lowrise 2 (L2) are rezoned to LR2.

 5. All areas designated on Attachment B as Lowrise 3 (L3) and Lowrise 4 (L4) are rezoned to Lowrise 3 (LR3).

 B. Attachment B to this ordinance, which is incorporated by this reference, shows the areas being rezoned as described in this Section.

 C. Except for the LDT, L1, L2, L3 and L4 classifications, all other designations and classifications of the property rezoned by this Section remain in effect.

 D. This ordinance is not intended to release or modify either the terms of any agreement previously made in connection with the rezoning of any property, or any conditions or restrictions included in any rezone decision or ordinance, except as expressly provided in subsection E of this Section. As to each lot being rezoned in this ordinance from a zoning designation previously established by a map amendment conditioned upon a recorded agreement, all conditions and restrictions stated in the applicable prior rezone decision, ordinance or agreement, whether or not referring to a specific zoning designation or rezone action, continue as conditions and restrictions under the zoning designation established by this ordinance. Such rezones include, but are not limited to, those authorized by the following ordinances: Ordinance 122206 (Clerk File (CF) 307285); Ordinance 111985 (CF 292534); Ordinance 98717 (CF 293916); Ordinance 121960 (CF 306618); Ordinance 120561; Ordinance 111705 (CF 291852); Ordinance 111222 (CF 292030); Ordinances 113699, 113704, 113706 and 113707 (CF 294977); Ordinance 116912 (CF 298562); Ordinance 121795 (306768); Ordinance 121323 (CF 305399); Ordinance 121164 and 121404 (CF 305400); Ordinance 122098 (CF 307452); Ordinance 122304 (CF 307580); Ordinance 115664 (CF 298162); Ordinance 116501 (CF) 298303; Ordinance 117580 (CF 299930); Ordinance 118518 (CF 301537); Ordinance 122184 (CF 307757); Ordinance 115760 (CF 298192); Ordinance 117214 (CF 299299); and Ordinance 122185 (CF 307093). The City Council finds that the restrictions in each such agreement are necessary in order to ameliorate adverse impacts that could occur from unrestricted use and development permitted by development regulations otherwise applicable after the rezones effected by this ordinance.

 E. Any property previously rezoned from LDT, L1, L2, L3, or L4 pursuant to an ordinance under which the rezone could expire or the zoning could otherwise revert to the previous designation under specified conditions shall, upon any expiration or other event by which the zoning would revert to such classification but for the effect of this ordinance, automatically become rezoned to the LR1, LR2 or LR3 classification that would have applied under subsection A of this Section if the property had been shown on Attachment B as having that prior zoning classification.

 Section 2. Subsections A and B of Section 23.22.062 of the Seattle Municipal Code, which section was last amended by Ordinance 123046, are amended as follows:

 23.22.062 Unit lot subdivisions

 A. The provisions of this ((~~section~~))  Section 23.22.062  apply exclusively to the unit subdivision of land for townhouse((~~s~~)),  rowhouse, and  cottage housing developments, ((~~and cluster development for housing,~~)) as permitted in Single-Family, Residential Small Lot and Lowrise zones, and for single-family dwelling units in Lowrise zones, or any combination of the above types of residential development, as permitted in the applicable zones.

 B. Except for any site for which a permit has been issued pursuant to Section s  23.44.041  or 23.45.545 for a detached accessory dwelling unit, ((~~sites~~))  lots  developed or proposed to be developed with ((~~dwelling units listed~~))  uses described  in subsection  23.22.062. A above may be subdivided into individual unit lots. The development as a whole shall meet development standards applicable at the time the permit application is vested. As a result of the subdivision, development on individual unit lots may be nonconforming as to some or all of the development standards based on analysis of the individual unit lot, except that any private((~~,~~)) usable open space or private amenity area for each dwelling unit shall be provided on the same  unit  lot as the dwelling unit it serves.

 * * *

 Section 3. Subsections A and B of Section 23.24.045 of the Seattle Municipal Code, which section was last amended by Ordinance 123046, are amended as follows:

 23.24.045 Unit lot subdivisions((~~.~~))

 A. The provisions of this ((~~section~~)) Section 23.24.045  apply exclusively to the unit subdivision of land for townhouse((~~s~~)),  rowhouse, and  cottage housing developments((~~, and cluster development for housing,~~)) as permitted in Single-Family, Residential Small Lot and Lowrise zones, and for single-family dwelling units in Lowrise zones, or any combination of the above types of residential development, as permitted in the applicable zones.

 B. Except for any ((~~site~~))  lot  for which a permit has been issued pursuant to Section s  23.44.041  or 23.45.545 for a detached accessory dwelling unit, ((~~sites~~))  lots  developed or proposed to be developed with ((~~dwelling units listed~~)) uses described  in subsection  23.24.045. A above may be subdivided into individual unit lots. The development as a whole shall meet development standards applicable at the time the permit application is vested. As a result of the subdivision, development on individual unit lots may be nonconforming as to some or all of the development standards based on analysis of the individual unit lot, except that any private, usable open space  or private amenity area for each dwelling unit shall be provided on the same  unit lot as the dwelling unit it serves.

 * * *

 Section 4. Subsection A of Section 23.30.010 of the Seattle Municipal Code, which section was last amended by Ordinance 122311, is amended as follows:

 23.30.010 Classifications for the purpose of this subtitle((~~.~~))

 All land within the City shall be classified as being within one ((~~(1) land use~~))zoning designation.

 A. General ((~~Z~~)) z oning ((~~D~~)) d esignations. The zoning classification of land shall include one of the designations in this subsection  23.30.010. A. Only in the case of land designated "RC" the classification shall include both "RC" and one additional  multifamily zone  designation in this subsection  23.30.010.

 Section 23.34.010 Designation of single-family zones

 * * *

 B. Areas zoned single-family or RSL that meet the criteria for single-family zoning contained in subsection B of Section 23.34.011 and that are located within the adopted boundaries of an urban village may be rezoned to zones more intense than Single-family 5000 ((~~when~~))  if  all of the following conditions are met:

 1. A neighborhood plan has designated the area as appropriate for the zone designation, including specification of the RSL/T, RSL/C, or RSL/TC suffix ,  ((~~when~~))  if  applicable;

 2. The rezone is:

 a. To a Residential Small Lot (RSL), Residential Small Lot-Tandem (RSL/T), Residential Small Lot-Cottage (RSL/C), Residential Small Lot-Tandem/Cottage (RSL/TC), ((~~Lowrise Duplex/Triplex (LDT),~~)) Lowrise 1 (L R 1), Lowrise 1/Residential-Commercial (L R 1/RC), or

 b. Within the areas identified on Map P-1 of the adopted North Beacon Hill Neighborhood Plan, and the rezone is to any Lowrise zone, or to an NC1 zone or NC2 zone with a 30 foot or 40 foot height limit, or

 c. Within the residential urban village west of Martin Luther King Junior Way South in the adopted Rainier Beach Neighborhood Plan, and the rezone is to a ~~Lowrise Duplex/Triplex (LDT),~~ Lowrise 1 (L R 1) or Lowrise 2 (L R 2) zone.

 * * *

 Section 6. Section 23.34.013 of the Seattle Municipal Code, which section was last amended by Ordinance 117430, is amended as follows:

 23.34.013 Designation of multifamily zones((~~.~~))

 An area zoned single~~~~family that meets the criteria of Section 23.34.011 for single- family designation((~~,~~)) may not be rezoned to multifamily except as otherwise provided in Section 23.34.010((~~~~)) . B.

 Section 7. Section 23.34.014 of the Seattle Municipal Code, which section was last amended by Ordinance 117430, is amended as follows:

 23.34.014 Lowrise ((~~Duplex/Triplex (LDT)~~))  1 (LR1) zone, function and locational criteria((~~.~~))

 A. Function. ((~~An area that provides opportunities for limited infill housing development, both through new construction and the conversion of existing single-family structures to duplexes and triplexes, where, in order to preserve the character of the neighborhood, the recycling of existing structures to a slightly higher density and small-scale infill development is preferable to single- family zoning or to the development of townhouses or higher density apartments.~~))  The function of the LR1 zone is to provide opportunities for low-density multifamily housing, primarily rowhouse and townhouse developments, through infill development that is compatible with single-family dwelling units, or through the conversion of existing single-family dwelling units to duplexes or triplexes.

 ((~~B. Locational Criteria. The Lowrise Duplex/Triplex zone designation is most appropriate in areas generally characterized by the following:~~

~~1. Development Characteristics of the Area.~~

~~a. Areas where structures of small bulk and low heights, generally less than thirty (30) feet, establish the pattern of development; and~~

~~b. Areas with a mix of single- family structures, small multifamily structures, and single- family structures legally converted into multiple units where, because of the type and quality of the existing housing stock, it is desirable to limit new development opportunities to infill projects and conversions that preserve the existing character.~~

~~2. Relationship to the Surrounding Area.~~

~~a. Areas that do not meet single- family criteria, but are otherwise similar in character and adjoin areas zoned single-family or Lowrise 1 without necessarily the presence of a significant topographical break or open space to provide a transition to increased density;~~

~~b. Areas where narrow streets, on- street parking congestion, local traffic congestion, lack of alleys, or irregular street patterns restrict local access and circulation;~~

~~c. Areas close to existing or projected facilities and services used by households with children, including schools, parks and community centers.~~))~~~~

 B. Locational Criteria. The LR1 zone is most appropriate in areas generally characterized by the following conditions:

 1. The area is similar in character to single- family zones;

 2. The area is either:

 a. located outside of an urban center, urban village, or Station Area Overlay District;

 b. a limited area within an urban center, urban village, or Station Area Overlay District that would provide opportunities for a diversity of housing types within these denser environments; or

 c. located on a collector or minor arterial;

 3. The area is characterized by a mix of single-family dwelling units, multifamily structures that are similar in scale to single-family dwelling units, such as rowhouse and townhouse developments, and single-family dwelling units that have been converted to multifamily residential use or are well-suited to conversion;

 4. The area is characterized by local access and circulation that can accommodate low density multifamily development oriented to the ground level and the street, and/or by narrow roadways, lack of alleys, and/or irregular street patterns that make local access and circulation less suitable for higher density multifamily development;

 5. The area would provide a gradual transition between single-family zoned areas and multifamily or neighborhood commercial zoned areas; and

 6. The area is supported by existing or projected facilities and services used by residents, including retail sales and services, parks, and community centers.

 ((~~C. Areas zoned single family meeting the locational criteria for a single-family designation may be rezoned to LDT only when the provisions of Section~~

~~23.34.010(( )) . B are met.~~))

 Section 8. Section 23.34.016 of the Seattle Municipal Code, relating to the function and locational criteria for Lowrise 1 zones, which section was last amended by Ordinance 119242, and as shown in Attachment A to this ordinance, is repealed.

 Section 9. Section 23.34.018 of the Seattle Municipal Code, which section was last amended by Ordinance 123046, is amended as follows:

 23.34.018 Lowrise 2 (L R 2) zone, function and locational criteria((~~.~~))

 A. Function s . ((~~The intent of the Lowrise 2 zone is to encourage a variety of multifamily housing types with less emphasis than the Lowrise 1 zone on ground-related units, while remaining at a scale compatible with single-family structures.~~))  The dual functions of the LR2 zone are to:

 1. Provide opportunities for a variety of multifamily housing types in existing multifamily neighborhoods and along arterials that have a mix of small scale residential structures; and

 2. Accommodate redevelopment in areas within urban centers, urban villages, and Station Area Overlay Districts in order to establish multifamily neighborhoods of low scale and density.

 ((~~B.Locational Criteria. Lowrise 2 zone designation is most appropriate in areas generally characterized by the following:~~

~~1. Development Characteristics of the Areas.~~

~~a. Areas that feature a mix of single-family structures and small to medium multifamily structures generally occupying one or two lots, with heights generally less than 30 feet;~~

~~b. Areas suitable for multifamily development if topographic conditions and the presence of views make it desirable to limit height and building bulk to retain views from within the zone;~~

~~c. Areas occupied by a substantial amount of multifamily development if factors such as narrow streets, on-street parking congestion, local traffic congestion, lack of alleys and irregular street patterns restrict local access and circulation and make an intermediate intensity of development desirable.~~

~~2. Relationship to the Surrounding Areas.~~

~~a. Properties that are well-suited to multifamily development, but where adjacent single-family areas make a transitional scale of development desirable. It is desirable that there be a well-defined edge such as an arterial, open space, change in block pattern, topographic change or other significant feature providing physical separation from the single-family area. However, this is not a necessary condition if existing moderate scale multifamily structures have already established the scale relationship with abutting single-family areas;~~

~~b. Properties that are definable pockets within a more intensive area, if it is desirable to preserve a smaller scale character and mix of densities;~~

~~c. Properties in areas otherwise suitable for higher density multifamily development but where it is desirable to limit building height and bulk to protect views from uphill areas or from public open spaces and scenic routes;~~

~~d. Properties where vehicular access to the area does not require travel on "residential access streets" in less intensive residential zones.~~))

 B. Locational Criteria. The LR2 zone is most appropriate in areas generally characterized by the following conditions:

 1. The area is either:

 a. located in an urban center, urban village, or Station Area Overlay District where new development could help establish a multifamily neighborhood of small scale and density; or

 b. located in or near an urban center, urban village, or Station Area Overlay District, or on an arterial street, and is characterized by one or more of the following conditions:

 1) small-scale structures generally no more than 35 feet in height that are compatible in scale with SF and LR1 zones;

 2) the area would provide a gradual transition between SF or LR1 zones and more intensive multifamily or neighborhood commercial zones; and

 2. The area is characterized by local access and circulation conditions that accommodate low density multifamily development;

 3. The area has direct access to arterial streets that can accommodate anticipated vehicular circulation, so that traffic is not required to use streets that pass through lower density residential zones; and

 4. The area is well supported by existing or projected facilities and services used by residents, including retail sales and services, parks, and community centers, and has good pedestrian access to these facilities.

 ((~~C. Areas zoned single family that meet the locational criteria for single-family designation may be rezoned to L2 only if the provisions of subsection 23.34.010.B are met.~~))

 Section 10. Section 23.34.020 of the Seattle Municipal Code, which section was last amended by Ordinance 121700, is amended as follows:

 23.34.020 Lowrise 3 (L R 3) zone, function and locational criteria((~~.~~))

 A. Function s . ((~~An area that provides moderate scale multifamily housing opportunities in multifamily neighborhoods where it is desirable to limit development to infill projects and conversions compatible with the existing mix of houses and small to moderate scale apartment structures.~~))  The dual functions of the LR3 zone are to:

 1. provide opportunities for a variety of multifamily housing types in existing multifamily neighborhoods, and along arterials that have a mix of small to moderate scale residential structures; and

 2. accommodate redevelopment in areas within urban centers, urban villages, and Station Area Overlay Districts in order to establish multifamily neighborhoods of moderate scale and density.

 B. Locational Criteria.

 ((~~1. Threshold Conditions. Subject to subsection B2 of this section, properties that may be considered for an L3 designation are limited to the following:~~

~~a. Properties already zoned L3;~~

~~b. Properties in areas already developed predominantly to the permitted L3 density and where L3 scale is well established;~~))  The LR3 zone is most appropriate in areas generally characterized by the following conditions:

 ((~~c~~)) 1. The area is either:

 a. located in an urban center, urban village, or Station Area Overlay District where new development could help establish a multifamily neighborhood of moderate scale and density, except in the following urban villages: the Wallingford Residential Urban Village, the Eastlake Residential Urban Village, the Upper Queen Anne Residential Urban Village, the Morgan Junction Residential Urban Village, the Lake City Hub Urban Village, the Bitter Lake Village Hub Urban Village, and the Admiral Residential Urban Village; or

 b. located in an existing multifamily neighborhood in or near an urban center, urban village, or Station Area Overlay District, or on an arterial street, and characterized by a mix of structures of low and moderate scale;

 ((~~c. Properties within an urban center or village,~~~~except in the Wallingford Residential Urban Village, in the Eastlake Residential Urban Village, in the Upper Queen Anne Residential Urban Village, in the Morgan Junction Residential Urban Village, in the Lake City Hub Urban Village, in the Bitter Lake Village Hub Urban Village, or in the Admiral Residential Urban Village; or~~))

 2. The area is near neighborhood commercial zones with comparable height and scale;

 3. The area would provide a transition in scale between LR1 and/or LR2 zones and more intensive multifamily and/or commercial zones;

 4. The area has street widths that are sufficient for two-way traffic and parking along at least one curb;

 5. The area is well served by public transit;

 6. The area has direct access to arterial streets that can accommodate anticipated vehicular circulation, so that traffic is not required to use streets that pass through lower density residential zones;

 7. The area well supported by existing or projected facilities and services used by residents, including retail sales and services, parks, and community centers, and has good pedestrian access to these facilities.

 ((~~d~~)) C .  The LR3 zone is also appropriate in areas ((~~Properties~~)) located in the Delridge  High Point Neighborhood Revitalization Area, as shown in ((~~Exhibit~~))  Map A for 23.34.020 ((~~A~~)), provided that the L R 3 zone designation would facilitate a mixed-income housing development initiated by ((~~a public agency or~~)) the Seattle Housing Authority  or other public agency ; a property use and development agreement is executed subject to the provisions of ((~~SMC~~)) Chapter 23.76 as a condition to any rezone; and the development would serve a broad public purpose.

 ((~~2~~)) D .  Except as provided in this subsection 23.34.020.D, properties ((~~Properties~~)) designated as environmentally critical may not be rezoned to an L R 3 designation, and may remain L R 3 only in areas predominantly developed to the intensity of the L R 3 zone.  The preceding sentence does not apply if the environmentally critical area either:

 1. was created by human activity, or

 2. is a designated peat settlement, liquefaction, seismic or volcanic hazard area, or flood prone area, or abandoned landfill.

 ((~~3. Other Criteria. The Lowrise 3 zone designation is most appropriate in areas generally characterized by the following:~~

~~a. Development Characteristics of the Area.~~

~~(1) Either:~~

~~(a) Areas that are already developed predominantly to the permitted L3 density and where L3 scale is well established,~~

~~(b) Areas that are within an urban center or urban village, except or~~

~~(2) Areas where the street pattern provides for adequate vehicular circulation and access to sites. Locations with alleys are preferred. Street widths should be sufficient for two (2) way traffic and parking along at least one (1) curbside.~~

~~b. Relationship to the Surrounding Areas.~~

~~(1) Properties in areas that are well served by public transit and have direct access to arterials, so that vehicular traffic is not required to use streets that pass through less intensive residential zones;~~

~~(2) Properties in areas with significant topographic breaks, major arterials or open space that provide sufficient transition to LDT or L1 multifamily development;~~

~~(3) Properties in areas with existing multifamily zoning with close proximity and pedestrian connections to neighborhood services, public open spaces, schools and other residential amenities;~~

~~(4) Properties that are adjacent to business and commercial areas with comparable height and bulk, or where a transition in scale between areas of larger multifamily and/or commercial structures and smaller multifamily development is desirable.~~))

 Section 11. Section 23.34.022 of the Seattle Municipal Code, relating to the function and locational criteria for the Lowrise 4 zone, which section was last amended by Ordinance 121700, and as shown in Attachment A to this ordinance, is repealed.

 B. Following a presubmittal conference, a proponent may apply to begin the SDR guidance process.

 1. The application for SDR guidance shall include the following:

 a. An initial site analysis addressing site opportunities and constraints, adjacent buildings, and the zoning of the site and adjacent properties;

 b. A drawing of existing site conditions, indicating topography of the site and location of structures and prominent landscape elements on the site (including but not limited to all trees 6 inches or greater in diameter measured 4.5 feet above the ground, with species indicated) if any;

 c. A preliminary site plan including structures, open spaces, vehicular and pedestrian access, and landscaping;

 d. A brief description of how the proposal meets the intent of the applicable citywide and neighborhood design review guidelines; and

 e. One or more color renderings adequate to depict the overall massing of structures and the design concept.

 2. Notice of application for SDR Guidance shall be provided pursuant to Chapter 23.76.

 3. The purpose of SDR Guidance is to receive comments from the public, identify concerns about the site and design concept, identify applicable citywide and neighborhood design guidelines of highest priority to the site, explore conceptual design and siting alternatives, and identify and document proposed development standard adjustments, which may be approved as a Type I decision pursuant to Section 23.41.018.D, or departures, which may be approved as a Type II decision pursuant to Section 23.41.016. The intent of SDR Guidance is not to reduce the general development capacity of the lot.

 4. As a result of the SDR Guidance process, the Director shall prepare a report that identifies those guidelines of highest priority and applicability, documents any design changes needed to achieve consistency with the design guidelines, and identifies any desired development standard adjustments and/or departures.

 5. The Director shall distribute a copy of the report to the applicant, place it on file in the Department, and provide access to the report on the Department website.

 C. Application for Type I or Type II Master Use Permit.

Adjustments to certain development standards pursuant to subsection 23.41.018.D may be approved as a Type I decision. If the need for development standard departures, authorized under Section 23.41.012 and beyond the adjustments allowed under subsection 23.41.018.D, is identified, the applicant may either revise the application to eliminate the need for the further departures, and proceed under this Section 23.41.018, or else apply for a Type II Master Use Permit for administrative design review pursuant to Section 23.41.016.

 3. Notice of application for a permit for a project subject to SDR shall be provided according to Chapter 23.76.

 D. SDR decision.

 1. The Director shall consider public comments on the proposed project, and the Director's decision shall be based on the extent to which the application meets applicable design guidelines and responds to the SDR guidance report.

 2. The Director's decision pursuant to the SDR process shall not reduce the number of units allowed per square foot of lot area when such a density limit is set in Table A for Section 23.45.512.

 3. The Director may allow the adjustments listed in subsection 23.41.018.D.4, if the adjustments are consistent with the SDR design guidance report and the adjustments would result in a development that:

 a. better meets the intent of the adopted design guidelines and/or

 b. provides a better response to environmental and/or site conditions, including but not limited to topography, the location of trees, or adjacent uses and structures.

 4. If the criteria listed in subsection 23.41.018.D.3 are met, the Director may allow adjustments to the following development standards to the extent listed for each standard:

 a. Setbacks and separation requirements may be reduced by a maximum of 50 percent;

 b. Amenity areas may be reduced by a maximum of 10 percent;

 23.45.529 Design standards

 A. Intent. The intent of the design standards in this Section 23.45.529 is to:

 1. Enhance street-facing facades to provide visual interest, promote new development that contributes to an attractive streetscape, and avoid the appearance of blank walls along a street;

 2. Foster a sense of community by integrating new pedestrian-oriented multifamily development with the neighborhood street environment and promoting designs that allow easy surveillance of the street by area residents;

 3. Promote livability in multifamily areas by providing a sense of openness and access to light and air; and

 4. Encourage the compatibility of a variety of housing types with the scale and character of neighborhoods where new multifamily development occurs.

 B. Application of provisions. The provisions of this Section 23.45.529 apply to all residential uses that do not undergo any type of design review pursuant to Chapter 23.41, except single-family dwelling units.

 C. Treatment of street-facing facades. For the purposes of this subsection 23.45.529.C, a street-facing facade includes all vertical surfaces enclosing interior space, including gables and dormers, as shown in Exhibit A for 23.45.529.

[Exhibit A for 23.45.529: Measurement of Street-facing Facades](/~ordpics/117014_2345529exa.gif)

 1. Facade openings.

 a. At least 20 percent of the area of each street-facing facade shall consist of windows and/or doors.

 b. Only transparent windows count toward the requirement for facade openings in this subsection 23.45.529.C.1. Windows composed of glass blocks or opaque glass, garage doors, and doors to~~~~utility and service areas, do not count.

 2. Facade articulation.

 a. If a street-facing facade or portion of a street-facing facade is not vertical, the Director shall determine whether the facade is substantially vertical and required to comply with this subsection 23.45.529.C.

 b. If the street-facing facade of a structure exceeds 750 square feet in area, division of the facade into separate facade planes is required (see Exhibit B for 23.45.529).

 c. In order to be considered a separate facade plane for the purposes of this subsection 23.45.529.C.2, a portion of the street-facing facade shall have a minimum area of 150 square feet and a maximum area of 500 square feet, and shall project or be recessed from abutting facade planes by a minimum depth of 18 inches.

 d. Trim that is a minimum of 0.75 inches deep and 3.5 inches wide is required to mark roof lines, porches, windows and doors on all street-facing facades.

[Exhibit B for 23.45.529: Street-facing Facades ](/~ordpics/117014_2345529exb.gif)

 e. The Director may allow exceptions to the facade articulation requirements in this subsection 23.45.529.C.2, if the Director determines that the street- facing facade will meet the intent of subsection 23.45.529.A.1, and the intent of subsections 23.45.529.D.2, E.3, and F.4 for cottage housing developments, rowhouse developments, and townhouse developments, respectively, through one or more of the following street-facing facade treatments:

 1) Variations in building materials and/or color, or both, that reflect the stacking of stories or reinforce the articulation of the facade;

 2) Incorporation of architectural features that add interest and dimension to the facade, such as porches, bay windows, chimneys, pilasters, columns, cornices, and/or balconies;

 3) Special landscaping elements provided to meet Green Factor requirements pursuant to Section 23.45.524, such as trellises, that accommodate vegetated walls covering a minimum of 25 percent of the facade surface;

 4) Special fenestration treatment, including an increase in the percentage of windows and doors to at least 25 percent of the street-facing facade(s).

 D. Design standards for cottage housing developments.

 1. Pedestrian entry. Each cottage with a street- facing facade that is located within 10 feet of the street lot line shall have a visually prominent pedestrian entry through the use of covered stoops, porches, or other architectural entry features. For cottages on corner lots that have more than one street-facing facade within 10 feet of the street lot line, a visually prominent pedestrian entry is required on only one of the street-facing facades. Access to these entrances may be through a required private amenity area that abuts the street.

 2. Architectural expression. Cottage housing developments shall include architectural details that reduce the visual scale of the units. Each cottage shall employ one or more of the following design techniques to reduce visual scale of the units:

 a. Attached covered porch

 b. Roofline features such as dormers or clerestories

 c. Bay windows

 d. Variation in siding texture and materials

 e. Other appropriate architectural techniques demonstrated by the applicant to reduce the visual scale of cottages.

 7. If the lot does not abut an improved alley or street, access may be permitted from an easement that meets the provisions of Chapter 23.53, Requirements for Streets, Alleys, and Easements.

 ((~~D. Exceptions for parking location and access. The Director may permit an alternate location of parking on the lot or access to off-street parking as a Type I decision based on consideration of the following:~~

~~1. whether access would negatively impact public safety by requiring backing onto an arterial street;~~

~~2. whether on-street parking capacity is maintained or loss of on-street parking is minimized by measures such as serving two garages with one curb cut.~~

~~3. whether, as a result, the project is better integrated with the topography of the lot, such as by providing structured parking below grade or shared parking that reduces the overall impact of parking on the design of the project.~~

~~4. whether the siting of development on the lot is improved, allowing for more landscaping or increased Green Factor scoreand/or amenity areas, and reduced surface parking area; and~~

~~5. whether the flow of vehicular or pedestrian traffic is not significantly impacted.~~))

 ((~~E. Parking shall be screened from all streets and adjacent uses pursuant to Section 23.45.524.~~))  D. Screening of parking.

A setback equal to half the difference between the current right-of-way width and the minimum right-of-way width established in subsection 23.53.015.A.6 ((~~of this section~~)) is required; provided, however, that if a setback has been provided under this provision, other lots on the block shall provide the same setback. In all residential zones except Highrise zones, an additional 3 foot setback is also required. The area of the setback may be used to meet any development standard, except that required parking may not be located in the setback. Underground structures that would not prevent the future widening and improvement of the right-of- way may be permitted in the required setback by the Director((~~, as a Type I decision~~)), after consulting with the Director of Transportation.

 1) Types of ((~~P~~)) p rojects.

 i. Proposed developments that contain more than two but fewer than ten units in SF, RSL, ((~~LDT~~)) and L R 1 zones, or fewer than six residential units in all other zones, or proposed short plats in which no more than two additional lots are proposed to be created;

 ii. The following uses if they are smaller than 750 square feet of gross floor area: major and minor vehicle repair uses, and multipurpose retail sales;

 iii. Nonresidential structures that have less than 4,000 square feet of gross floor area and that do not contain uses listed in subsection 23.53.015.D.2.b.1 ) .ii that are larger than 750 square feet;

 iv. Structures containing a mix of residential uses and either nonresidential uses or live-work units, if there are fewer than ten units in SF, RSL, ((~~LDT~~)) and L R 1 zones, or fewer than six residential units in all other zones, and the square footage of nonresidential use is less than specified in subsections 23.53.015.D.2.b.1 ) .ii and D.2.b.1 ) .iii;

 v. Remodeling and use changes within existing structures;

 vi. Additions to existing structures that are exempt from environmental review; and

 vii. Expansions of surface parking, outdoor storage, outdoor sales or outdoor display of rental equipment of less than 20 percent of the parking, storage, sales or display area or number of parking spaces.

 2) Paving ((~~R~~)) r equirement. For the types of projects listed in subsection 23.53.015.D.2.b.1 ) , the streets abutting the lot shall have a hard-surfaced roadway at least 18 feet wide. If there is not an 18 foot wide hard- surfaced roadway, the roadway shall be paved to a width of at least 20 feet from the lot to the nearest hard-surfaced street meeting this requirement, or 100 feet, whichever is less. Streets that form a dead end at the property to be developed shall be improved with a cul-de-sac or other vehicular turnaround as specified in the Right-of-Way Improvements Manual. ((~~The~~))  As a Type 1 decision,  the  Director, after consulting with the Director of Transportation, shall determine whether the street has the potential for being extended or whether it forms a dead end because of topography and/or the layout of the street system.

 3) Other ((~~R~~)) r equirements. The requirements of subsection 23.53.015.D.1.b shall also be met.

 3. Exceptions from ((~~R~~)) r equired ((~~S~~)) s treet ((~~I~~)) i mprovements. ((~~The~~))  As a Type 1 decision,  the  Director, in consultation with the Director of Transportation, may waive or modify the requirements for paving and drainage, dedication, setbacks, grading, no-protest agreements, landscaping, and curb installation if one or more of the following conditions are met. The waiver or modification shall provide the minimum relief necessary to accommodate site conditions while maximizing access and circulation.

 a. Location in an environmentally critical area or buffer, disruption of existing drainage patterns, or removal of natural features such as significant trees or other valuable and character-defining mature vegetation makes widening and/or improving the right-of-way impractical or undesirable.

 b. The existence of a bridge, viaduct or structure such as a substantial retaining wall in proximity to the project site makes widening and/or improving the right-of- way impractical or undesirable.

 c. Widening the right-of-way and/or improving the street would adversely affect the character of the street, as it is defined in an adopted neighborhood plan or adopted City plan for green street s , boulevards, or other special rights-of-way, or would otherwise conflict with the stated goals of such a plan.

 d. Widening and/or improving the right-of-way would preclude vehicular access to an existing lot.

 e. Widening and/or improving the right-of-way would make building on a lot infeasible by reducing it to dimensions where development standards cannot reasonably be met.

 f. One or more substantial principal structures on the same side of the block as the proposed project are located in the area needed for future expansion of the right- of-way and the structure(s)' condition and size make future widening of the remainder of the right-of-way unlikely.

 g. Widening and/or improving the right-of-way is impractical because topography would preclude the use of the street for vehicular access to the lot, for example due to an inability to meet the required 20 percent maximum driveway slope.

 h. Widening and/or improving the right-of-way is not necessary because it is adequate for current and potential vehicular traffic, for example, due to the limited number of lots served by the development or because the development on the street is at zoned capacity.

 Section 62. Subsection A of Section 23.53.025 of the Seattle Municipal Code, which section was last amended by Ordinance 122205, is amended as follows:

 23.53.025 Access easement standards((~~.~~))

 1. Easement width shall be a minimum of ((~~ten (~~))10((~~)~~)) feet, or ((~~twelve (~~))12((~~)~~)) feet if required by the Fire Chief due to distance of the structure from the easement.

 2. No maximum easement length shall be set. If easement length is more than ((~~one hundred fifty (~~))150((~~)~~)) feet, a vehicle turnaround shall be provided.

 3. Curbcut width from the easement to the street shall be the minimum necessary for safety and access.

(1) Required parking for spectator sports facilities or exhibition halls must be available when the facility or exhibition hall is in use. A facility shall be considered to be "in use" during the period beginning three hours before an event is scheduled to begin and ending one hour after a scheduled event is expected to end. For sports events of variable or uncertain duration, the expected event length shall be the average length of the events of the same type for which the most recent data are available, provided it is within the past five years. During an inaugural season, or for nonrecurring events, the best available good faith estimate of event duration will be used. A facility will not be deemed to be "in use" by virtue of the fact that administrative or maintenance personnel are present. The Director may reduce the required parking for any event when projected attendance for a spectator sports facility is certified to be 50 percent or less of the facility's seating capacity, to an amount not less than that required for the certified projected attendance, at the rate of one space for each ten fixed seats of certified projected attendance. An application for reduction and the certification shall be submitted to the Director at least 15 days prior to the event. When the event is one of a series of similar events, such certification may be submitted for the entire series 15 days prior to the first event in the series. If the Director finds that a certification of projected attendance of 50 percent or less of the seating capacity is based on satisfactory evidence such as past attendance at similar events or advance ticket sales, the Director shall, within 15 days of such submittal, notify the facility operator that a reduced parking requirement has been approved, with any conditions deemed appropriate by the Director to ensure adequacy of parking if expected attendance should change. The parking requirement reduction may be applied for only if the goals of the facility's Transportation Management Plan are otherwise being met. The Director may revoke or modify a parking requirement reduction approval during a series, if projected attendance is exceeded.

(2)The amount of required parking is calculated based on the maximum number of staff or animals the center is designed to accommodate.

(3) The general requirements of lines A through H of Table A for Section 23.54.015 is superseded to the extent that a use, structure or development qualifies for either a greater or a lesser parking requirement (which may include no requirement) under any other provision. To the extent that a nonresidential use fits within more than one line in Table A for Section 23.54.015, the least of the applicable parking requirements applies. The different parking requirements listed for certain categories of nonresidential uses shall not be construed to create separate uses for purposes of any requirements related to establishing or changing a use under this Title 23.

Footnotes for Table B for Section 23.54.015:

(1) The general requirement of line (( H )) I of Table B for Section 23.54.015 for multifamily residential uses is superseded to the extent that a use, structure or development qualifies for either a greater or a lesser parking requirement (which may include no requirement) under any other provision. To the extent that a multifamily residential use fits within more than one line in Table B for Section 23.54.015, the least of the applicable parking requirements applies, except that if an applicable parking requirement in section B of Table B for Section 23.54.015 requires more parking than line (( H )) I, the parking requirement in line (( H )) I does not apply. The different parking requirements listed for certain categories of multifamily residential uses shall not be construed to create separate uses for purposes of any requirements related to establishing or changing a use under this Title 23.

(2) For development within single-family zones the Director may waive some or all of the parking requirements according to Section 23.44.015 as a special or reasonable accommodation. In other zones, if the applicant can demonstrate that less parking is needed to provide a special or reasonable accommodation, the Director may (( , as a Type I decision, )) reduce the requirement. The Director shall specify the parking required and link the parking reduction to the features of the program that allow such reduction. The parking reductions shall be valid only under the conditions specified, and if the conditions change, the standard requirements shall be met.

(3) Notice of Income Restrictions. Prior to issuance of any permit to establish, construct or modify any use or structure, or to reduce any parking accessory to a multifamily residential use , if the applicant relies upon these reduced parking requirements, the applicant shall record in the King County (( Office of Records and Elections )) Recorder a declaration signed and acknowledged by the owner(s), in a form prescribed by the Director, which shall identify the subject property by legal description, and shall acknowledge and provide notice to any prospective purchasers that specific income limits are a condition for maintaining the reduced parking requirement.

 23.54.020 Parking quantity exceptions

 A. Adding Units to Existing Structures in Multifamily and Commercial Zones.

 1. For the purposes of this Section 23.54.020, "existing structures" means those structures that were established under permit, or for which a permit has been granted and has not expired as of the applicable date, as follows:

 a. In multifamily zones, August 10, 1982;

 b. In commercial zones, June 9, 1986.

 2. In locations  in a multifamily or commercial zone  where there is a minimum parking requirement, one dwelling unit may  either  be added to an existing structure ((~~in a multifamily or commercial zone~~))  or may be built on a lot that contains an existing structure without additional parking if both of the following requirements are met:

 a. Either the existing parking provided on the lot meets development standards, or the lot area is not increased and existing parking is screened and landscaped to the greatest extent practical; and

 b. Any additional parking shall meet all development standards for the zone.

 3.

 Section 66. Section 23.54.025 of the Seattle Municipal Code, which section was enacted by Ordinance 112777, is amended as follows:

 23.54.025 ((~~Parking covenants~~))  Off-site parking ((~~.~~))

 ((~~When parking is provided on a lot other than the lot of the use to which it is accessory, the following conditions shall apply:~~

~~A. The owner of the parking spaces shall be responsible for notifying the Director should the use of the lot for covenant parking cease. In this event, the principal use must be discontinued, other parking meeting the requirements of this Code must be provided within thirty (30) days, or a variance must be applied for within fourteen (14) days and subsequently granted.~~

~~B. A covenant between the owner or operator of the principal use, the owner of the parking spaces and The City of Seattle stating the responsibilities of the parties shall be executed. This covenant and accompanying legal descriptions of the principal use lot and the lot upon which the spaces are to be located shall be recorded with the King County Department of Records and Elections, and a copy with recording number and parking layouts shall be submitted as part of any permit application for development requiring parking.~~))

 A. Where allowed. Off-site parking may be established by permit on a lot where the type of parking proposed is allowed by the provisions of this Title 23, if the lot's location is an eligible for parking accessory to the use for which the parking is required. If parking and parking access, including the proposed off-site parking, are or will be the sole uses of a lot, or if surface parking outside of structures will comprise more than half of the lot area, or if parking will occupy more than half of the gross floor area of all structures on a lot, then a permit to establish off-site parking may be granted only if principal use parking is a permitted use for such lot.

 B. Development standards.

 1. Off-site parking shall satisfy the screening and landscaping requirements and other development standards applicable where it is located, except to the extent that it is legally nonconforming to development standards prior to establishment of the off-site parking use. Unless otherwise provided, development standards regarding the relation of parking to structures apply to off-site parking in the same manner as they apply to parking accessory to the uses in such structures.

 2. Parking allowed only as temporary surface parking does not qualify as off-site parking.

 3. Parking shall not be established as off-site parking for more than one use unless authorized to be shared according to the shared parking provisions of this Chapter 23.54.

 4. If maximum parking limits apply to a use, off-site parking permitted for that use shall count against the maximum limit unless otherwise expressly stated in the provisions of this Title 23 applicable to the lot where the use requiring parking is located.

 C. Permit requirements.

 1. When all or part of the required parking for a use is to be provided on a lot other than the lot on which the use requiring parking is located, a permit must be obtained to establish off-site parking for the use requiring parking as a use on the off-site parking lot.

 2. The permit application must be submitted by or on behalf of the owner of the off-site parking lot along with written consent of the owner of the lot on which the use requiring parking is located, or such owner's authorized representative.

 3. The permit may be issued only after the applicant has demonstrated that the off-site parking complies with all applicable requirements of this Title 23. An application to establish off-site parking, or to change the use for which off-site parking is provided, may be considered as part of the application to establish, expand or change the use requiring off-site parking.

 D. Required notice.

 1. When off-site parking is required parking for a use on any lot, notice of this off-site parking arrangement shall be recorded with the King County Recorder for both lots. The notice shall:

 a. include legal descriptions of both the lots on which the use requiring parking is located and the off-site parking lot; and

 b. identify by an attached drawing the number and location of spaces established as off-site parking for the use requiring parking;

 2. A copy of the notice, with attached drawing, shall be submitted as part of any permit application for any use for which the off-site parking is to be used to satisfy all or part of the parking requirement. Once the permit application is complete in every other respect, a copy of the notice, with attached drawing and a recording number assigned by the King County Recorder, shall be submitted prior to issuance of the permit.

 E. Termination, change, or suspension of off-site parking use.

 1. Except as otherwise provided in subsection F of this Section 23.54.025, in order to terminate any off- site parking use, or to establish a new use for which off- site parking will be provided on the off-site parking lot, a change of use permit is required. Such a change of use permit shall not be issued unless:

 a. the owner of the lot on which the use requiring parking is located has been notified in writing of the change of use; and

 b. the off-site parking is not required for any reason, which may include one or more of the following:

 1) the use requiring parking has been discontinued or reduced in size;

 2) the parking is no longer required by this Title 23;

 3) other parking meeting the requirements of Title 23 has been provided for the use requiring parking and, if it is off-site parking, established by permit;

 4) a variance allowing the use requiring parking to continue without all or part of such off-site parking has been granted.

 2. If the owner of a lot where off-site parking is established plans to improve the lot and continue to provide off-site parking for the use requiring parking after completion of the improvements, the owners of such lot and the lot on which the use requiring parking is located, or such owners' authorized representatives, may apply for a temporary suspension of the off-site parking use, by submitting to the Director:

 a. a plan, with attached drawings showing the number and location of parking spaces, for providing interim parking for the use requiring parking, satisfying all applicable requirements of this title, until improvements to the off-site parking lot are completed;

 b. a plan, with attached drawings showing the number and location of parking spaces, for the provision of permanent parking for the use requiring parking, satisfying all applicable requirements of this title, when the improvements are completed; and

 c. such other materials as the Director may require to evaluate the proposal.

 3. If the Director approves the plans for purposes of subsection 23.54.025.E.2, then the Director may authorize the suspension of the off-site parking use pending the completion of the proposed improvements, conditioned upon issuance of a building permit for the proposed improvements, issuance of any permits necessary to establish the interim parking use, and the actual provision of the other off-site parking in accordance with applicable development standards.

 4. If a use requiring off-site parking is suspended as a result of fire, act of nature, or other causes beyond the control of the owners, or for substantial renovation or reconstruction, then subject to the applicable provisions in the zone or district where the off-site parking is located, the Director may approve the temporary use of the off-site parking to serve one or more other uses, or as general purpose parking, for a period not to exceed 180 days, subject to extensions for not more than 180 days if at the end of the initial period or any extension the use requiring parking has not recommenced.

 5. No permit for the demolition of a structure including off-site parking, established under this Section 24.54.025 or of any portion thereof necessary for such off- site parking, shall be issued, except in case of emergency, unless the off-site parking use has been terminated or temporarily suspended pursuant to this Section 23.54.025.E. If any such structure, or such portion thereof, is destroyed as a result of fire, act of nature, or other causes beyond the control of the owners, then the owner of the off-site parking lot may obtain a change of use permit. Upon such destruction of off-site parking, the lot on which the use requiring parking will be subject to Section 23.54.025.G.

 F. Off-site parking established by covenant.

 1.

The owner of any such off-site parking spaces and the owner of the use requiring parking each are responsible for notifying the Director should the use of any or all of those spaces as off-site parking for the use requiring parking cease.

 2. When maximum parking limits apply to a use requiring off-site parking, off-site parking permitted for that use under this subsection 23.54.025.F shall count against the maximum limit unless otherwise expressly stated in the provisions of this title that apply to the lot where the use requiring parking is located.

 3. Off-site parking established by covenant or other document approved by the Director, and not by permit establishing off-site parking use, is not subject to the requirements of subsection E of this section 23.54.025.

 4. Any replacement off-site parking established by covenant in compliance with subsection 23.54.025.G.1.e shall be considered to have been established as described in subsection 23.54.025. F.1.

 G. Effect of loss of required off-site parking.

 1. If, for any reason, any off-site parking used to satisfy the minimum required parking for any use requiring parking is not available for off-site parking for such use in conformity with the applicable use permit, then it shall be unlawful to continue the use requiring parking unless:

 a. other parking meeting the requirements of this Title 23 is provided on the same lot as the use requiring parking within 30 days; or

 b. other off-site parking is secured, a permit is applied for to establish the off-site parking use within 30 days, such permit is obtained within 180 days, and the other off-site parking is completed in accordance with all applicable requirements and is in use within 180 days unless the Director, upon finding that substantial progress toward completion has been made and that the public will not be adversely affected by the extension, grants an extension in writing; or

 c. the loss of off-site parking is caused by damage to or destruction of a structure, and either

 1) the owners of the off-site parking and of the lot of the use requiring parking apply for a permit to establish other existing spaces on the off- site parking lot as parking for such use within 90 days, and such permit is granted within 180 days; or

 2) the owner of the off-site parking lot applies for any permit necessary to repair or rebuild the structure so as to provide the off-site parking within 90 days, the off-site parking is completed in accordance with all applicable requirements within 180 days, unless the Director, upon finding that substantial progress toward completion has been made and that the public will not be adversely affected by the extension, grants an extension in writing, and if the location on the lot of the off-site parking is modified, the owner executes and records within 180 days an amendment to the notice identifying the location of the off-site parking in the rebuilt or repaired structure; or

 d. a variance is applied for within 30 days and subsequently granted; or

 e. the off-site parking was exempt, under subsection 23.54.025.F, from the requirements of subsections C, D, and E of this section 23.54.025, and within 30 days substitute off-site parking, on a lot where such parking is permitted by the provisions of this Title 23 and consistent with all applicable development standards, is provided and established by recorded covenant consistent with the terms of this Section 23.54.025 as in effect immediately prior to the effective date of this ordinance.

 2. Unless a variance is applied for within such 30 day period and not denied, upon the expiration of any applicable period in subsections 23.54.025.G.1.a, G.1.b or G.1.c without the completion of the action or actions required, the use requiring parking shall be discontinued to the extent necessary so that the remaining parking for that use satisfies the applicable minimum parking requirement. Upon the denial of a variance from parking requirements the use requiring parking must be discontinued to that extent, unless the conditions of subsection 23.54.025.G.1.a, G.1.b, G.1.c, or G.1.e are then satisfied. Each period stated in this subsection 23.54.025.G runs from the first date upon which spaces established as off-site parking are not available for use as off-site parking.

 23.86.006 Structure height  measurement

 A. ((~~Height measurement technique in~~)) In all zones except downtown zones and  zones within the South Lake Union ((~~Hub Urban Village~~))  Urban Center , and  except for the Living Building Pilot Program authorized by Section 23.40.060((~~.~~)) , unless otherwise specified, the height of structures shall be measured according to this subsection 23.86.006.A.

 1. General rule. Except as otherwise specified, the height of a structure is the difference between the elevation of the highest point of the structure not excepted from applicable height limits and the average grade level. In this subsection 23.86.006.A, "average grade level" means the average of the elevation of existing lot grades at the midpoints, measured horizontally, of each exterior walls of the structure, except as provided in subsection 23.86.006.A.2.

 2. Height measurement on sloping lots.

 a. The calculation of structure height in subsection 23.86.006.A.1 may be modified, at the discretion of the applicant, on sloping lots for which the elevation at the higher corner of at least one exterior wall is at least 20 feet higher than the elevation at the lower corner of that wall.

 b. If the condition of subsection 23.86.006.A.2.a is satisfied, then the height measurement method may be modified as follows:

 1) Draw the smallest rectangle that encloses the principal structure.

 2) Divide one side of the rectangle into equal segments at least 15 feet in length.

 3) The lines used to divide the length of the structure into individual segments shall be perpendicular to the side of the rectangle used to determine the difference in elevation in subsection 23.86.006.A.2.a and extend as a vertical plane from the ground to the sky.

 4) The maximum height for each segmented portion of the structure shall be measured from the average grade level for each segmented portion of the structure, which shall be calculated as the average elevation of existing lot grades at the midpoints of the two opposing exterior walls of each segmented portion of the structure.

 ((~~1. The height shall be measured at the exterior walls of the structure. Measurement shall be taken at each exterior wall from the existing or finished grade, whichever is lower, up to a plane essentially parallel to the existing or finished grade. For determining structure height, the exterior wall shall include a plane between supporting members and between the roof and the ground. The vertical distance between the existing grade, or finished grade, if lower, and the parallel plane above it shall not exceed the maximum height of the zone.~~

~~2. When finished grade is lower than existing grade, in order for an upper portion of an exterior wall to avoid being considered on the same vertical plane as a lower portion, it must be set back from the lower portion a distance equal to two (2) times the difference between existing and finished grade on the lower portion of the wall (Exhibit 23.86.006 A1).~~

~~3. Depressions such as window wells, stairwells for exits required by other codes, "barrier free" ramps on grade, and vehicle access driveways into garages shall be disregarded in determining structure height when in combination they comprise less than fifty percent (50%) of the facade on which they are located. In such cases, the grade for height measurement purposes shall be a line between the grade on either side of the depression.~~

~~4. No part of the structure, other than those specifically exempted or excepted under the provisions of the zone, shall extend beyond the plane of the maximum height limit.~~

~~5. Underground portions of structures are not included in height calculations. The height of structures shall be calculated from the point at which the sides meet the surface of the ground.~~))

 * * *

 ((~~D. Additional Height on Sloped Lots.~~

~~1. In certain zones, additional height shall be permitted on sloped lots at the rate of one foot (1') for each six percent (6%) of slope. For the purpose of this provision, the slope shall be measured from the exterior wall with the greatest average elevation at existing grade, to the exterior wall with the lowest average elevation at existing grade. The slope shall be the difference between the existing grade average elevations of the two (2) walls, expressed as a percentage of the horizontal distance between the two (2) walls.~~

~~2. This additional height shall be permitted on any wall of the structure, provided that on the uphill side(s) of the structure, the height of the wall(s) shall be no greater than the height limit of the zone (Exhibit 23.86.006 A2).~~

~~3. Structures on sloped lots shall also be eligible for the pitched roof provisions applicable in the zone.~~))

 Section 95. Section 23.86.007 of the Seattle Municipal Code, which section was last amended by Ordinance 115326, is amended as follows:

 23.86.007 Gross floor area and floor area ratio  measurement ((~~.~~))

 A. Certain items may be exempted from calculation of gross floor area of a structure. ((~~When~~))  Except as otherwise expressly provided in this Title 23, if gross floor area  of underground stories or portions of stories  ((~~below grade~~)) is exempted, the amount of below-grade  gross  floor area ((~~shall be~~))  is  measured as follows:

 1. ((~~The existing grade of the lot shall be established by the elevations of the perimeter lot lines of the lot.~~))  An underground story is that story or portion of a story for which the finished floor next above, or the roof surface if there is no next floor above, is at or below the abutting existing or finished grade, whichever is lower (See Exhibit A for 23.86.007).

 2. To determine the amount of gross floor area ((~~which~~))  that  is below grade : ((~~, find the point where the ceiling of each floor intersects the existing grade elevation. Draw a line perpendicular to the point of intersection. All gross floor area behind this line shall be considered below- grade (see Exhibit 23.86.007 A)~~)).

 a. determine the elevation of the finished floor of the story next above the underground story, or the roof surface if there is no next floor above the underground story;

 b. determine the points along the exterior wall of the story where the finished floor elevation or roof surface elevation above intersects the abutting corresponding existing or finished grade elevation, whichever is lower;

 c. draw a straight line across the story connecting the two points on the exterior walls;

 d. the gross floor area of an underground story or portion of an underground story is the area that is at or below the straight line drawn in step 23.86.007.A.2.c above.

~~[Exhibit A for 23.86.007: Floor Area Below Grade](/~ordpics/117014_2386007oldexa.gif)~~[Exhibit A for 23.86.007: Floor Area Below Grade](/~ordpics/117014_2386007exa.gif)

 B. Pursuant to subsection 23.45.510.E, for certain structures in multifamily zones, portions of a story that extend no more than 4 feet above existing or finished grade, whichever is lower, are exempt from calculation of gross floor area. The exempt gross floor area of such partially below- grade stories is measured as follows:

 1. determine the elevation 4 feet above the finished floor of the story next above the partially below- grade story, or 4 foot above the roof surface if there is no next floor above the partially below-grade story;

 2. determine the points along the exterior wall of the story where the elevation determined in step 23.86.007.B.1 above intersects the abutting corresponding existing or finished grade elevation, whichever is lower;

 3. draw a straight line across the story connecting the two points on the exterior walls;

 4. the gross floor area of the partially below- grade story or portion of a partially below-grade story is the area of the story that is at or below the straight line drawn in step 23.86.007.B.3 above (See Exhibit B for 23.86.007).

[Exhibit B for 23.86.007: Floor Area for Partially Below Grade Stories for Certain Structures in Multifamily Zones ](/~ordpics/117014_2386007exb.gif)

 C. Public rights-of-way ((~~shall not be~~))  are not  considered part of a lot when calculating floor area ratio; ((~~provided~~))  except  that ((~~when~~))  if dedication of right-of-way is required  as a condition of a proposed development , the area of dedicated right-of-way is included  ((~~permitted floor area ratio shall be calculated before the dedication is made~~)).

 D. If a lot is in more than one zone, the FAR limit for each zone applies to the portion of the lot located in that zone.

 E. In LR zones, if more than one category of residential use is located on a lot, the FAR limit for each category of residential use is based on each category's percentage of total structure footprint area, as follows:

 1. Calculate the footprint, in square feet, for each category of residential use. For purposes of this calculation, "footprint" is defined as the horizontal area enclosed by the exterior walls of the structure.

 2. Calculate the total square feet of footprint of all categories of residential uses on the lot.

 3. Divide the square footage of the footprint for each category of residential structure (subsection 23.86.007.D.1 above) by the total square feet of footprints of all residential uses (subsection 23.86.007.D.2 above).

 4. Multiply the percentage calculated in subsection 23.86.007.D.3 for each housing category by the area of the lot. The result is the area of the lot devoted to each housing category.

 5. The FAR limit for each category of residential use is the applicable one for that use multiplied by the percentage calculated in subsection 23.86.007.E.4.

 Section 96. Section 23.86.012 of the Seattle Municipal Code, which section was last amended by Ordinance 115326, is amended as follows:

 23.86.012  Multifamily zone setback measurement  ((~~Setbacks in multifamily zones.~~))

 A. Setback Averaging. In multifamily zones, certain required setbacks may be averaged. In such cases the following provisions apply:

 a. The average front and rear setbacks are calculated based on the entire width of the structure;

 b. The average side setbacks are calculated based on the entire depth of the structure;

 c. Setbacks are measured horizontally from the lot line to the facade of the structure, at the point that the structure meets the ground.

 ((~~A~~)) B .  Determining ((~~F~~)) f ront ((~~S~~)) s etbacks  for institutions .

 ((~~1. Determining Front Setback~~~~Requirements. Front setback requirements are presented in the development standards for each zone. Where~~))  In LR zones, the minimum required front setback  for institutions is ((~~to be~~)) determined by averaging the setbacks of structures on either side of the subject lot,  as follows  ((~~the following provisions shall apply~~)):

 ((~~a~~)) 1 . The required ((~~depth of the~~)) front setback ((~~shall be~~))  is  the average of the distance s  between principal structures and front lot lines of the nearest principal structures on each side of the subject lot  if each of those structures is on the same block front as the subject lot and is within 100 feet of the side lot lines of the subject lot  (Exhibit  A for 23.86.012((~~A~~))).

[Exhibit A for 23.86.012: Front Setback Averaging for Institutions](/~ordpics/117014_2386012exa.gif)

 ((~~b. The setbacks used for front setback averaging shall be on the same block front as the subject lot, and shall be the front setbacks of the nearest principal structures within one hundred (100) feet of the side lot lines of the subject lot.~~))

 2. If the first principal structure within 100 feet of a side lot line of the subject lot is not on the same block front or there is no principal structure within 100 feet of the side lot line, the setback depth used for averaging purposes on that side is 7 feet.

 ((~~c~~)) 3 . For averaging purposes,  the front setback ((~~depth shall be~~))  is  ((~~measured~~))  the shortest distance  from the front lot line to the nearest wall or, where there is no wall, the plane between supports ((~~which~~))  that span  ((~~comprises twenty (20)~~))  20  percent or more of the width of the front facade of the principal structure ((~~on either side~~)). Attached garages and enclosed porches ((~~shall be~~))  are  considered part of the principal structure for measurement purposes. Decks less than ((~~eighteen (18)~~))  18  inches above existing grade, uncovered porches, eaves, attached solar collectors and other similar parts of the structure ((~~shall not be~~))  are not  considered part of the principal structure. ((~~When the front facade of the principal structure is not parallel to the front lot line, the shortest distance from the front lot line to the structure shall be used for averaging purposes.~~))

 ((~~d~~)) 4 . ((~~When~~))  If  there is a dedication of street right-of-way to bring the street abutting the lot closer to the minimum widths established in Section 23.53.015, for averaging purposes the amount of dedication ((~~shall be~~))  is  subtracted from the front setbacks of the structures on either side.

 ((~~e. When the first principal structure within one hundred feet (100') of a side lot line of the subject lot is not on the same block front or when there is no principal structure within one hundred feet (100') of the side lot line, the setback depth used for averaging purposes on that side shall be ten feet (10').~~))

 ((~~f.~~))  5.  ((~~When~~))  If  the front setback of the first principal structure within ((~~one hundred feet (100')~~))  100 feet  of the side lot line of the subject lot exceeds ((~~twenty feet (20')~~))  20 feet , the setback depth used for averaging purposes on that side ((~~shall be~~))  is  ((~~twenty feet (20')~~))  20 feet .

 ((~~g.~~))  6.  In cases where the street is very steep or winding, the Director ((~~shall~~))  will  determine which adjacent structures should be used for averaging purposes.

 ((~~h.~~))  7.  In the case of a through lot, the ((~~requirement for~~)) front setback ((~~shall be~~))  is  determined independently for each street frontage. The measurement techniques of this section  23.86.012  ((~~shall be applied for~~))  apply to  each street frontage separately.

 ((~~i.~~))  8.  For ((~~cluster~~~~development~~))  multiple structures on the same lot , the front setback of a principal structure on the same lot may be used for averaging purposes.

 ((~~2. Front Setback Averaging. In certain zones the required front setback may be averaged. In such cases the following provisions shall apply:~~

~~a. The average distance from the front lot line to the facade shall satisfy the minimum front setback requirement. The front setback shall be is averaged for the entire width of the structure, except that areas which are farther than three (3) times the required front setback from the front lot line shall not be calculated in the front setback.~~

~~b. Portions of the facade at existing grade shall be used in determining the average setback.~~

~~c. Projections of the front facade which begin at least eight feet (8') above finished grade and project four feet (4') or less from the lower portion of the facade shall not be included in the setback averaging. For such projections which project more than four feet (4') from the lower portion of the facade, only the first four feet (4') shall be exempt from the averaging calculation. This provision applies to such features as cantilevered floor area, decks and bay windows. Eaves, gutters and cornices are permitted to project eighteen inches (18") beyond any front facade without being counted in averaging.~~))

 ((~~3. Measuring Street-facing Setbacks for Institutions and Public Facilities in Multifamily Zones.~~

~~a. In multifamily zones, the depth of setback from a street lot line may be averaged along the width and height of the facade for institutions and public facilities, as an alternative providing greater design flexibility than standard modulation requirements.~~

~~b. This average setback shall be calculated by dividing the three (3) dimensional volume of setback by the area of the structure facade.~~

~~(1) Find the sum of volumes within the space defined by extension of the roof line, the planes of the side walls, and the vertical extension of the front lot line; and~~

~~(2) Divide this sum by the area of the street-facing facade, calculated as the product of facade height and facade width (Exhibit 23.86.012 B~~))).

 ((~~[Exhibit B for 23.86.012: Average Facade Setback, Institutions and Public Facilities](/~ordpics/117014_2386012oldexb.gif)~~))

 ((~~B. Rear Setbacks. In Midrise zones applicants are given an option in multifamily zones to provide a minimum rear setback of ten feet (10') which must be modulated, or an averaged rear setback of at least fifteen feet (15'). The following provisions shall apply when the applicant has chosen to provide an averaged rear setback of at least fifteen feet (15'):~~

~~1. All projections of the facade shall be included in averaging the rear setback, with the exception of eaves, gutters and cornices which project eighteen inches (18") or less from the facades.~~

~~2. The rear setback shall be averaged for the entire width of the structure.~~

~~C. Side Setbacks.~~

~~((1. Side setbacks requirements are presented in the standard development requirements for each zone. Side setback requirements are based on the height and the depth of a structure. Where two (2) or more structures are connected by elevated walkways, structure depth shall be determined by the combined depth of the structures connected by the elevated walkway, not including the walkway itself.~~

~~2. Side Setback Averaging. In certain cases where specifically permitted, the side setback requirement may be satisfied by averaging the distance from side lot line to structure facade for the depth of the structure. In those cases the following provisions shall apply:~~

~~a. The side setback shall be measured horizontally from side lot line to the side facade of the structure.~~

~~b. The side setback shall be averaged for the entire depth of the structure , except that areas which are farther than two (2) times the required average side setback from the side lot line shall not be counted as part of the side setback (Exhibit 23.86.012 C.)~~

~~C. Setbacks Between Structures in Cluster Developments. Required setbacks in cluster developments are specified in each multifamily zone. In certain cases, the setback requirement may be satisfied by averaging the distance between the portions of the facades which face each other. In those cases the following provisions apply:~~

~~1. The setback shall be measured horizontally from one (1) facade to the other.~~

~~2. The setback shall be averaged across the width of those portions of the facades which face each other.~~))

 Section 100. A new Section 23.86.017 of the Seattle Municipal Code is added to read as follows:

 23.86.017 Amenity area measurement

 Certain zones require a minimum amount of amenity area to be provided on the lot. If amenity area is required, the following provisions shall apply:

 A. If the applicable development standards specify a minimum contiguous amenity area, areas smaller than the minimum contiguous area are not be counted toward fulfilling amenity area requirements.

 1. Driveways and vehicular access easements, whether paved or unpaved, shall be considered to separate the amenity areas they bisect, except for woonerfs permitted to qualify as required amenity area.

 2. Pedestrian access areas shall not be considered to break the contiguity of amenity area on each side.

 B. In shoreline areas, when determining the amount of amenity area required or provided, no land waterward of the ordinary high water mark shall be included in the calculation.

 C. In cases where the shape or configuration of the amenity area is irregular or unusual, the Director shall determine whether amenity area requirements have been met, notwithstanding the following provisions, based on whether the proposed configuration would result in amenity area that is truly usable for normal residential recreational purposes. For the purpose of measuring the minimum horizontal dimension of the amenity area, if one is specified, the following provisions shall apply:

 1. For rectangular or square areas, each exterior dimension of the area shall meet the minimum dimension (Exhibit A for 23.86.017).

[Exhibit A for Section 23.86.017: Measurement of Regular Amenity Area](/~ordpics/117014_2386017exa.gif)

 Section 101. Section 23.86.019 of the Seattle Municipal Code, which section was last amended by Ordinance 123209, is amended as follows:

 23.86.019 Green Factor  measurement

 A. Development standards for certain areas require landscaping that meets a minimum Green Factor score.  All required landscaping shall meet standards promulgated by the Director to provide for the long-term health, viability, and coverage of plantings. These standards may include, but are not limited to, the type and size of plants, spacing of plants, depth and quality of soil, use of drought-tolerant plants, and access to light and air for plants.  The Green Factor score shall be calculated as follows:

 1. Identify all proposed landscape elements, sorted into the categories presented in Table A for Section 23.86.019.

 2. Multiply the square feet, or equivalent square footage where applicable, of each landscape element by the multiplier provided for that element in Table A for Section 23.86.019, according to the following provisions:

 a. If multiple elements listed on Table A for Section 23.86.019 occupy the same area (for example, groundcover under a tree), count the full square footage or equivalent square footage of each element.

 b. Landscaping elements in the right-of-way between the lot line and the roadway may be counted, provided that they are approved by the Director of the Department of Transportation.

 c. Elements listed in Table A for Section 23.86.019 that are provided to satisfy any other requirements of this Code may be counted.

 d. For trees, large shrubs, and large perennials, use the equivalent square footage of each tree or shrub according to Table B for Section 23.86.019.

 e. For vegetated walls, use the square footage of the portion of the wall covered by vegetation. All vegetated wall structures, including fences counted as vegetated walls, shall be constructed of durable materials, provide adequate planting area for plant health, and provide appropriate surfaces or structures that enable plant coverage.

 f. For all elements other than trees, large shrubs, large perennials, and vegetated walls, square footage is determined by the area of the portion of a horizontal plane that lies over or under the element.

 g. All permeable paving and structural soil credits together may not count for more than one third of the  lot's Green Factor score ((~~for a lot~~)).

 3. Add together all the products calculated under subsection 23.86.019.A.2 to determine the Green Factor numerator.

 4. Divide the Green Factor numerator by the lot area to determine the Green Factor score.

 Section 104. Section 25.05.675 of the Seattle Municipal Code, which section was last amended by Ordinance 123209, is amended as follows:

 25.05.675 Specific environmental policies((~~.~~))

 * * *

 M. Parking.

 1. Policy ((~~B~~)) b ackground.

 a. Increased parking demand associated with development projects may adversely affect the availability of parking in an area.

 b. Parking regulations to mitigate most parking impacts and to accommodate most of the cumulative effects of future projects on parking are implemented through the City's Land Use Code. However, in some neighborhoods, due to inadequate off-street parking, streets are unable to absorb parking spillover. The City recognizes that the cost of providing additional parking may have an adverse effect on the affordability of housing.

 2. Policies.

 a. It is the City's policy to minimize or prevent adverse parking impacts associated with development projects.

 b. Subject to the overview and cumulative effects policies set forth in Sections 25.05.665 and 25.05.670, the decision maker may condition a project to mitigate the effects of development in an area on parking; provided that:

 1) No SEPA authority is provided to mitigate the impact of development on parking availability in the ((~~downtown zones~~))  Downtown and South Lake Union Urban Centers ;

 2) ((~~In Seattle Mixed (SM) zones, and~~)) No SEPA authority is provided  for the decision maker to ((~~require more parking than the minimum required by the Land Use Code~~)) mitigate the impact of development on parking availability  for residential uses located within:

 i.  the Capitol Hill/First Hill Urban Center,  the Uptown Urban Center, and the University District ((~~Northwest~~))Urban Center ((~~Village~~)) , except the portion of the Ravenna urban village that is not within 1,320 feet of a street with frequent transit service, measured as the walking distance from the nearest transit stop to the lot line of the lot;

 ii.  ((~~and~~)) the Station Area Overlay District~~,~~ ;  and

 iii. portions of urban villages within 1,320 feet of a street with frequent transit service, measured as the walking distance from the nearest transit stop to the lot line of the lot ((~~no SEPA authority is provided for the decision maker to require more parking than the minimum required by the Land Use Code~~));

 3)  Outside of the areas listed in subsection 25.05.675.M.2.b, ((~~Parking~~))  parking impact mitigation for multifamily development, except in the Alki area, as described in subsection 25.05.675.M.2.c ((~~below~~)), may be required only where on-street parking is at capacity, as defined by the Seattle Department of Transportation or where the development itself would cause on-street parking to reach capacity as so defined.

 c. For the Alki area, as identified on Map B for ((~~23.45.015~~))  23.54.015 , a higher number of spaces per unit than is required by SMC Section 23.54.015 may be required to mitigate the adverse parking impacts of specific multifamily projects. Projects that generate a greater need for parking and that are located in places where the street cannot absorb that need -- for example, because of proximity to the Alki Beach Park -- may be required to provide additional parking spaces to meet the building's actual need. In determining that need, the size of the development project, the size of the units and the number of bedrooms in the units shall be considered.

 d.  If parking ((~~Parking~~)) impact mitigation  is authorized by this subsection 25.05.675.M, it ((~~for projects outside of downtown zones~~)) may include but is not limited to:

 1) Transportation management programs;

 2) Parking management and allocation plans;

 3) Incentives for the use of alternatives to single-occupancy vehicles, such as transit pass subsidies, parking fees, and provision of bicycle parking space;

 4) Increased parking ratios((~~, except for projects located~~~~within Seattle Mixed (SM) zones, and residential uses located in, the Capitol Hill/First Hill Urban Center, the University District Northwest Urban Center Village, and the Station Area Overlay District~~)) ;  and

 5) Reduced development densities to the extent that it can be shown that reduced parking spillover is likely to result; provided, that parking impact mitigation for multifamily development may not include reduction in development density.

 Section 109. The Council requests that the Department of Planning and Development (DPD) establish a specific target for review time for permit applications subject to the streamlined administrative design review (SDR) process. DPD will report on the target in the online permit turnaround data that the Department updates monthly, and will report on the number of applications and the turnaround times as part of the regular Department presentations to the Committee on the Built Environment or its successor Committee. In addition, the Council requests that the DPD submit a written report evaluating the SDR process to all Councilmembers two months after Master Use Permit decisions for ten SDR projects have been published. In the report, DPD will provide an evaluation of the per unit cost of SDR, the amount of staffing required for SDR to the applicant, DPD performance in meeting the review targets, the amount and purpose of any adjustments granted by DPD through the SDR process, the effects on project design and development capacity, and potential program improvements. The report should provide this information by zone category. The Council will reevaluate the SDR process based on the DPD report findings if necessary to address efficiency, cost, and/or quality of project design.

 Section 110. The provisions of this ordinance are declared to be separate and severable. The invalidity of any particular provision, or its invalidity as applied in any circumstances, shall not affect the validity of any other provision or the application of the particular provision in other circumstances. To the extent that sections of this ordinance recodify or are incorporated into new or different sections provisions of the Seattle Municipal Code as previously in effect, this ordinance shall be construed to continue such provisions in effect. The repeal of various sections of Title 23 of the Seattle Municipal Code by this ordinance shall not relieve any person of the obligation to comply with the terms and conditions of any permit issued pursuant to the provisions of such Title as in effect prior to such repeal, nor shall it relieve any person or property of any obligations, conditions or restrictions in any agreement or instrument made or granted pursuant to, or with reference to, the provisions of such Title in effect prior to such repeal.

 Attachment A to Lowrise Multifamily Code Amendment Ordinance: Repealed Code Sections

 Attachment A to Lowrise Multifamily Code Amendment Ordinance: Repealed Code Sections

 The repealed sections of the Land Use Code are shown below in numerical order. When the repealed section references an exhibit, that exhibit is also repealed. The title of the repealed section is followed by a reference to the number of the repealing section of the ordinance.

 23.34.016 Lowrise 1 (L1) zone, function and locational criteria. (Ordinance Section 8)

 A. Function. An area that provides low density, primarily ground-related multifamily housing opportunities.

 B. Locational Criteria. Lowrise 1 zone designation is most appropriate in areas generally characterized by the following:

 1. Development Characteristics of the Area.

 a. Areas where structures of low heights, generally less than thirty (30) feet, and small bulk establish the pattern of development;

 b. Areas with:

 (1) A mix of single-family structures, small multifamily structures and single-family structures legally converted into multiple units where, because of the type and quality of the existing housing stock, it is desirable to encourage new development opportunities, or

 (2) Numerous or large vacant parcels suitable for family housing where densities greater than single-family are desired; and

 c. Areas where internal vehicular circulation is conducive to residential units that are oriented to the ground level and the street. Preferred locations are generally separated from principal arterials, as defined by the Seattle Comprehensive Transportation Program, which conflict with the desired character of L1 areas.

 2. Relationship to the Surrounding Areas.

 a. Properties that are definable pockets within a larger, higher density multifamily area, where it is desirable to preserve a small-scale character;

 b. Properties generally surrounded by a larger single-family area where variation and replacement in housing type could be accommodated without significant disruption of the pattern, character or livability of the surrounding development;

 c. Properties where a gradual transition is appropriate between single-family areas and more intensive multifamily or neighborhood commercial zones;

 d. Properties in areas where narrow streets, on-street parking congestion, local traffic congestion, or irregular street patterns restrict local access and circulation;

 e. Properties in areas close to facilities and services used by households with children, including schools, parks and community centers.

 C. Areas zoned single family meeting the locational criteria for single-family designation may be rezoned to L1 only when the provisions of Section 23.34.010 B are met.

 23.34.022 Lowrise 4 (L4) zone, function and locational criteria. (Ordinance Section 11)

 A. Function. An area that provides moderate density multifamily infill development in residential neighborhoods already characterized by moderate density residential structures, with good vehicular circulation, adequate alleys, and on-street parking.

 B. Locational Criteria.

 1. Threshold Conditions. Subject to subsection B2 of this section, properties that may be considered for an L4 designation are limited to the following:

 a. Properties already zoned L4;

 b. Properties in areas already developed predominantly to the permitted L4 density and where L4 scale is well established;

 c. Properties within an urban center or urban village, except in the Wallingford Residential Urban Village, in the Eastlake Residential Urban Village, in the Upper Queen Anne Residential Urban Village, in the Morgan Junction Residential Urban Village, in the Lake City Hub Urban Village, in the Bitter Lake Village Hub Urban Village, or in the Admiral Residential Urban Village; or

 d. Properties located in the Delridge Neighborhood Revitalization Area, as shown in Exhibit 23.34.020 A, provided that the L4 zone designation would facilitate a mixed-income housing development initiated by a public agency or the Seattle Housing Authority; a property use and development agreement is executed subject to the provisions of SMC Chapter 23.76 as a condition to any rezone; and the development would serve a broad public purpose.

 2. Properties designated as environmentally critical may not be rezoned to an L4 designation, and may remain L4 only in areas predominantly developed to the intensity of the L4 zone.

 3. Other Criteria. The Lowrise 4 zone designation is most appropriate in areas generally characterized by the following:

 a. Development Characteristics of the Area.

 (1) Either:

 (a) Areas that are already developed predominantly to the permitted L4 density and where L4 scale is well established,

 (b) Areas that are within an urban center or urban village, except in the Wallingford Residential Urban Village, in the Eastlake Residential Urban Village, in the Upper Queen Anne Residential Urban Village, in the Morgan Junction Residential Urban Village, in the Lake City Hub Urban Village, in the Bitter Lake Village Hub Urban Village, or in the Admiral Residential Urban Village, or

 (c) Areas that are located within the Delridge Neighborhood Revitalization Area, as shown in Exhibit 23.34.020 A, provided that the L4 zone designation would facilitate a mixed-income housing development initiated by a public agency or the Seattle Housing Authority; a property use and development agreement is executed subject to the provisions of SMC Chapter 23.76 as a condition to any rezone; and the development would serve a broad public purpose.

 (2) Areas of sufficient size to promote a high quality, higher density residential environment where there is good pedestrian access to amenities;

 (3) Areas generally platted with alleys that can provide access to parking, allowing the street frontage to remain uninterrupted by driveways, thereby promoting a street environment better suited to the level of pedestrian activity associated with higher density residential environments;

 (4) Areas with good internal vehicular circulation, and good access to sites, preferably from alleys. Generally, the width of principal streets in the area should be sufficient to allow for two (2) way traffic and parking along at least one (1) curbside.

 b. Relationship to the Surrounding Areas.

 (1) Properties in areas adjacent to concentrations of employment;

 (2) Properties in areas that are directly accessible to regional transportation facilities, especially transit, providing connections to major employment centers, including arterials where transit service is good to excellent and street capacity is sufficient to accommodate traffic generated by higher density development. Vehicular access to the area should not require use of streets passing through less intensive residential areas;

 (3) Properties with close proximity and with good pedestrian connections to services in neighborhood commercial areas, public open spaces and other residential amenities;

 (4) Properties with well-defined edges providing sufficient separation from adjacent areas of small scale residential development, or where such areas are separated by zones providing a transition in the height, scale and density of development.

 3. Required landscaping shall meet standards promulgated by the Director.

 C. Tree Requirements in Landscaped Areas in Lowrise Duplex/Triplex, Lowrise 1, and Lowrise 2 Zones.

 1. Trees shall be required when new lowrise multifamily dwelling units are constructed. This requirement may be met using options in subsection C1a or C1b below. The minimum number of caliper inches of tree required per lot may be met through using either the tree preservation option or tree planting option set forth below, or through a combination of preservation and planting. Trees within public and private rights-of-way may not be used to meet this standard.

 a. Tree Preservation Option. For lots over three thousand (3,000) square feet, at least two (2) caliper inches of existing tree per one thousand (1,000) square feet of lot area must be preserved. On lots that are three thousand (3,000) square feet or smaller, at least three (3) caliper inches of existing tree must be preserved per lot. When this option is used, a tree preservation plan is required.

 b. Tree Planting Option. For lots over three thousand (3,000) square feet, at least two (2) caliper inches of tree per one thousand (1,000) square feet of lot area must be planted. On lots that are three thousand (3,000) square feet or smaller, at least three (3) caliper inches of tree must be planted per lot.

 2. Tree Measurements. Trees planted to meet the requirements in subsection C1 above shall be at least one and one-half (1.5) inches in diameter. The diameter of new trees shall be measured (in caliper inches) six (6) inches above the ground. Existing trees shall be measured four and one-half (4.5) feet above the ground. When an existing tree is three (3) to ten (10) inches in diameter, each one (1) inch counts as one (1) inch toward meeting the tree requirements in subsection C1 above. When an existing tree is more than ten (10) inches in diameter, each one (1) inch of the tree that is over ten (10) inches shall count as three (3) inches toward meeting the tree requirement.

 3. Tree Preservation Plans. If the tree preservation option is chosen, a tree preservation plan must be submitted and approved. The plan may be submitted as part of the overall landscaping plan for the project. Tree preservation plans shall provide for protection of trees during construction according to standards promulgated by the Department of Planning and Development.

 2. The storage space shall not be located in any required driveways, parking aisles, or parking spaces for the structure;

 3. The storage space shall not block or impede any fire exits, public rights-of-ways or any pedestrian or vehicular access; and

 4. The storage space shall be located to minimize noise and odor to building occupants and neighboring developments.

 D. Access to the storage space for occupants and service providers shall meet the following requirements:

 1. For rear-loading containers (usually two (2) cubic yards or smaller):

 a. Any proposed ramps to the storage space shall be of six (6) percent slope or less, and

 b. Any proposed gates or access routes must be a minimum of six (6) feet wide; and

 2. For front-loading containers (usually larger than two (2) cubic yards):

 a. Direct access shall be provided from the alley or street to the containers,

 b. Any proposed gates or access routes shall be a minimum of ten (10) feet wide, and

 c. When accessed directly by a collection vehicle into a structure, a twenty-one (21) foot overhead clearance shall be provided.

 E. The solid waste and recyclable materials storage space specifications required in subsections A, B, C, and D of this section above, in addition to the number and sizes of containers, shall be included on the plans submitted with the permit application.

 F. The Director, in consultation with the Director of Seattle Public Utilities, shall have the discretion to modify the requirements of subsections A, B, C, and D of this section above under the following circumstances:

 1. When the applicant can demonstrate difficulty in meeting any of the requirements of subsections A, B, C, and D of this section; or

 2. When the applicant proposes to expand a multifamily or mixed-use building, and the requirements of subsections A, B, C, and D of this section conflict with opportunities to increase residential densities and/or retain ground-level retail uses; and

 3. When the applicant proposes alternative, workable measures that meet the intent of this section.

 23.86.020 Modulation. (Ordinance Section 100)

 Modulation criteria are described in the development standards for each multifamily residential zone. The following provisions describe how measurements shall be made in determining whether modulation requirements have been met.

 A. Modulation Width.

 1. Modulation width shall be the width of a facade segment between the points at which adjacent segments begin to step forward or back (Exhibit 23.86.020 A).

 2. Balconies and decks shall be considered to be projections of the facade for the purpose of measuring modulation width.

 3. The stepping forward or back in the facade between which modulation width is measured shall be sufficient to satisfy the minimum modulation requirements for width and depth specified in the standard development requirements for the appropriate multi-family zone. Steps in the facade which do not satisfy minimum modulation width or depth requirements shall not be considered to form a separate facade segment for the purpose of measuring modulation width, until such steps cumulatively satisfy the minimum dimension required.

 4. In cases where the design of a structure is so unusual that the above provisions cannot be applied; for example, for wedge-shaped or curved facade projections; the Director shall determine when modulation requirements have been met.

 B. Modulation Depth.

 1. Modulation depth shall be the distance a facade segment steps forward or back from an adjacent facade segment (Exhibit 23.86.020 B).

 2. Balconies and decks shall be considered to be projections of the facade for the purpose of measuring modulation depth.

 3. When portions of a facade which step forward or back do not satisfy the minimum modulation width or depth specified in the standard development requirements for the appropriate multifamily zone, such portions shall not be considered to form a separate facade segment for the purpose of measuring modulation depth, until such steps cumulatively satisfy the minimum dimensions required.

 4. In cases where the design of the structure is so unusual that the above provisions cannot be applied, the Director shall determine when modulation requirements have been met.

 C. Calculating Maximum Permitted Modulation Width. The maximum width of modulation is prescribed in the standard development requirements for each multi-family zone. In those cases for which the maximum modulation width may be increased if the modulation depth is increased, the following provisions shall apply:

 1. When the depth of modulation provided allows the structure to qualify for increased modulation width, each adjacent facade segment shall qualify for the increased width, each adjacent facade segment shall qualify for the increased width (Exhibit 23.86.020 C).

 2. When a facade segment is bounded by two (2) modulated segments of differing depths, the maximum modulation width shall be determined by the greater of the two modulation depths (Exhibit 23.86.020 D).
