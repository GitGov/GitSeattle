 AN ORDINANCE relating to the charging of electric vehicles; authorizing the Director of Finance and Administrative Services, the Director of the Seattle Center Department, the Superintendent of Parks and Recreation, and the Seattle City Librarian to set per-session fees for public use of electric vehicle charging stations in parking facilities owned or controlled by each of their respective departments; making it an infraction and imposing a monetary penalty for an unauthorized vehicle to park in a space reserved for electric vehicle parking while charging; amending Sections 3.39.020, 11.31.121, 17.04.030, and 18.28.010 of the Seattle Municipal Code; adding new Section 11.72.125 to the Seattle Municipal Code; and ratifying and confirming certain prior acts.

 WHEREAS, greenhouse gas emissions related to transportation constitute more than fifty percent of all greenhouse gas emissions in the State of Washington; and

 WHEREAS, the use of hydro-power, which represents sixty-six percent of Washington's electricity production, as a transportation fuel instead of petroleum fuel, results in significant reductions in the emissions of pollutants including greenhouse gases, is cheaper, and reduces the reliance of the state on imported sources of energy for transportation making electrification of Seattle's transportation one of the most promising opportunities for reducing the carbon impact of our city; and

 WHEREAS, the development of electric vehicle infrastructure is a critical step in creating jobs, fostering economic growth, reducing greenhouse gas emissions, reducing our reliance on foreign fuels, and reducing the pollution of Puget Sound attributable to the operation of petroleum- based vehicles on streets and highways; and

 WHEREAS, Seattle is one of the first markets in the United States to welcome significant numbers of electric vehicles to our roads, and the creation of a robust charging infrastructure network will remove barriers to widespread adoption of electric vehicles; and

 WHEREAS, American Recovery and Reinvestment Act funds have been directed to Seattle for the development of electric vehicle charging infrastructure through the EV Project, for infrastructure in private property, and the Puget Sound Clean Air Agency, for infrastructure in public property; and

 WHEREAS, on October 25, 2010, the City Council passed Ordinance 123434 accepting grant funds from the Department of Energy through the Puget Sound Clean Air Agency and allocated through the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 for the purpose of installing electric vehicle charging infrastructure; and

 WHEREAS, the City has installed electric vehicle charging stations for the use of the City's fleet and is in the process of installing publicly available electric vehicle charging stations in parking facilities owned or controlled by the City; and

 WHEREAS, establishing a per-session fee for public use of electric vehicle charging stations in City owned and managed parking facilities would allow for cost recovery, NOW, THEREFORE,
