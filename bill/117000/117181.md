Qwest Corporation shall assume all of the responsibilities and duties of the Permittee under Ordinance 96413, as amended by Ordinances 119126 and 121855, and as amended by this ordinance. The permission (also referred to in this ordinance as a permit) is renewed for a ten-year period starting January 31, 2008 and ending at 11:59 p.m. on January 30, 2018 upon the terms and conditions set forth in Ordinance 96413, as amended by Ordinances 119126 and 121855, and as further amended by this ordinance.

 2.  Term.  ((~~That all rights, privileges and authority~~~~herein conferred upon and~~))  The permission (also referred to in this ordinance as a permit)  granted to ((~~said permittee,~~))  the Permittee and  its successors and assigns, shall be for a ((~~period~~))  term  of ten ((~~(10)~~)) years , beginning on the effective date of this ordinance and ending at 11:59 p.m. on the last day of the tenth year  ((~~; provided that upon the~~)) . Upon written  application of the Permittee  at least 180 days before expiration of the term,  the Director of  the Seattle Department of  Transportation ((~~("Director")~~))  (Director)  may renew ((~~said permit~~))  the permission  for ten-year ((~~periods~~))  terms  not to exceed a total of ((~~fifty (50)~~))  50  years, subject to the right of the ((~~Director to revise the fee provided for in Section 8 hereof, and of the City Council,~~))  City of Seattle (City) to require the removal of the tunnel as provided for in Section 2B and 2C, or revise  by ordinance((~~, to revise~~)) any ((~~of the terms and~~)) conditions ((~~contained herein~~))  of this ordinance .  The Permittee shall submit a complete application for a new term permit ordinance no later than 180 days prior to the expiration of the ordinance term. Failure to obtain additional permission through a new tunnel ordinance, or to remove the tunnel prior to expiration of the term, is a violation of Chapter 15.90 of the Seattle Municipal Code (SMC).

 2A. Protection of utilities. The permission granted is subject to the Permittee bearing the expense of any protection, support or relocation of existing utilities deemed necessary by the owners of the utilities; and the Permittee being responsible for any subsequent damage to the utilities due to the construction, repair, reconstruction, maintenance, or operation of the tunnel.

 2B. Removal for public use or for cause. The permission granted is subject to use of the right-of-way by the City and the public for travel, utility purposes, and other street uses. The City expressly reserves the right to require the Permittee to remove the tunnel, or any part thereof or installation thereon, at the Permittee's sole cost and expense in the event that:

 i) the City Council determines by ordinance that the space occupied by the tunnel is necessary for any public use or benefit or that the tunnel interferes with any public use or benefit; or

 ii) the Director determines that any term or condition of this ordinance has been violated and the violation has not been corrected by the Permittee by the compliance date after a written request by the City to correct the violation.

 A City Council determination that the space is needed for or interferes with a public use or benefit shall be conclusive and final without any right of the Permittee to resort to the courts to adjudicate the matter.

 2C. Removal requirements . ((~~In the event said permit~~))  If the permission granted  is not renewed  at the expiration of a term , or ((~~in the event~~))  if  the permission ((~~hereby granted extends~~))  is extended  to its termination  date in  ((~~fifty (50)~~))  50  years ((~~from the effective date of this ordinance~~))  and an application for a new permit is not granted, or if an acceptance of this ordinance is not timely received as required by this ordinance; or if the City orders removal of the tunnel pursuant to the terms and conditions of this ordinance , then within ((~~ninety (90)~~))  90  days after ((~~its~~))  the expiration or termination, ((~~as the case may be, said permittee, its successors and assigns~~))  or prior to the date stated in an Order to Remove; the Permittee  shall, ((~~if so required by the City by written notice given on or before the date of expiration or termination~~))  at its own expense , remove the tunnel ((~~structure and fill in the subsurface area occupied thereby, or fill in said tunnel structure, as may be prescribed by said written notice and restore the surface and subsurfaces of said alley which~~))  and replace all portions of the right-of-way that  may have been disturbed ((~~in constructing, repairing or using said tunnel to as good condition in all respects as the abutting portion thereof~~))  for any part of the tunnel in as good condition as they were prior to construction of the tunnel and in at least as good condition in all respects as the abutting portions of the right-of-way as required by the applicable SDOT standards for right-of-way restoration .  If the Permittee removes the tunnel in accordance with the terms and conditions of this section, the Director shall then issue a certificate discharging the Permittee from responsibility under this ordinance.

 3. ((~~Said~~))  The  tunnel shall be used as a ((~~passageway for pedestrians~~))  utility connection  and for ((~~any~~)) use ((~~which the permittee desires to make of it~~)) in connection with the operation ((~~and conduct~~)) of ((~~its~~))  the Permittee's  business or ((~~any~~)) facilities used in connection ((~~therewith~~)) and located on the properties described ((~~above~~))  in Section 1 .

 4 A . ((~~Said~~))  Repair, reconstruction, readjustment or relocation.  The  tunnel shall occupy in ((~~said~~))  the  alley a horizontal space of approximately ((~~5~~))  five  feet and a vertical space of approximately ((~~9~~))  nine  feet for the full width of ((~~said~~))  the  alley and shall be constructed of reinforced concrete at a depth and according to plans and specification approved by the ((~~City Engineer~~))  Director . The ((~~permittee~~))  Permittee  shall  not  reconstruct ((~~and~~))  or  repair ((~~said~~))  the tunnel ((~~according to~~))  except under the supervision of the Director and in strict accordance with plans ((~~and~~)) ,  specifications ((~~submitted to and~~)) , and permit  approved by ((~~said City Engineer at any time when at the discretion of the Board of Public Works of The City of Seattle such reconstruction or repair is necessary, whether due to~~))  the Director. The Director may, in the Director's judgment, order the tunnel reconstructed, relocated, readjusted, or repaired at the Permittee's own cost and expense because of: the  deterioration or ((~~any other cause; and shall upon order of the Board of Public Works repair any defect in said alley caused, in the judgment of the Board of Public Works, by the presence of said tunnel~~))  unsafe condition of the tunnel; or the installation, construction, reconstruction, maintenance, operation or repair of any municipally-owned public utilities; or for any other cause .

 4B. Failure to correct unsafe condition. After written notice to the Permittee and failure of the Permittee to correct any unsafe conditions within the time stated in the notice, the Director may order the tunnel be closed or removed at the Permittee's expense if the Director deems that it has become unsafe or creates a risk of injury to the public. If there is an immediate threat to the health or safety of the public, a notice to correct is not required.

 4C. Continuing obligation to remove and restore.  Notwithstanding termination or expiration of the permission granted, or closure or removal of the tunnel, the Permittee shall remain bound by its obligation under this ordinance until:

 (a)  the tunnel and all its equipment and property are removed from the right-of-way;

 (b)  the area is cleared and restored in a manner and to a condition satisfactory to the Director; and

 (c)  the Director certifies that the Permittee has discharged its obligations under this ordinance.

 Upon prior notice to the Permittee and entry of written findings that it is in the public interest, the Director may, in the Director's sole discretion, conditionally or absolutely excuse the Permittee from compliance with all or any of the Permittee's obligations to remove the tunnel and its property and to restore any disturbed areas.

 5.  Release, hold harmless, indemnification, and duty to defend.  ((~~That the said permittee~~))  The tunnel shall remain the exclusive responsibility of the Permittee and the Permittee agrees to maintain the tunnel in good and safe condition. The Permittee  by ((~~its acceptance~~))  accepting the terms  of this ordinance ((~~and the rights, privileges and authority hereby granted, does covenant and agree~~))  releases the City from any and all claims resulting from damage or loss to the Permittee's property; and agrees  for itself, its successors and assigns((~~, with~~~~The City of Seattle,~~)) ;  to at all times protect and save harmless the ((~~said~~)) City ((~~of Seattle~~)) from all claims, actions, suits, liability, loss, costs, expenses or damages of every kind and description ((~~which~~)) , excepting only damages that may result from the sole negligence of the City; that  may accrue to((~~,~~)) or be suffered by((~~,~~)) any person ((~~or persons~~)) or property((~~,~~))  including without limitation, damage or injury to the Permittee, its officers, agents, employees, contractors, invitees, tenants and tenants' invitees, or licensees or its successors and assigns;  by reason of the construction, reconstruction, replacing, readjustment, repair, maintenance, operation or use of ((~~said~~))  the  tunnel , or any portion thereof; or by reason of anything that has been done or may at any time be done by the Permittee by reason of this ordinance; or by reason of the Permittee failing or refusing to strictly comply with every provision of this ordinance.

 ((~~; and in case~~))  If  any  suit,  action ,  or ((~~suit shall be~~))  claim of the nature described above is filed,  instituted ,  or begun against ((~~said~~))  the  City ((~~for damages arising out of or by reason of the construction, reconstruction, replacing, readjustment, repair, maintenance, operation or use of said tunnel, the said permittee, its successors and assigns~~)),  the Permittee ,  its successors or assigns,  shall((~~,~~)) upon notice ((~~to it or them, upon commencement of said suit or action,~~))  from the City; defend the ((~~same~~))  City  at its or their sole cost and expense((~~,~~)) ;  and ((~~in case~~))  if a  judgment ((~~shall be~~))  is  rendered against ((~~said~~))  the  City in any ((~~such~~)) suit or action, ((~~said permittee~~))  the Permittee , its successors and assigns, shall fully satisfy ((~~such~~))  the  judgment within ((~~ninety (90)~~))  90  days after ((~~such~~))  the  action or suit ((~~shall have~~))  has  been finally determined, if determined adversely to the City.  If it is determined by a court of competent jurisdiction that Revised Code of Washington (RCW) 4.24.115 applies to this ordinance, then in the event claims or damages are caused by or result from the concurrent negligence of:

 (a) the City, its agents, contractors or employees; and,
