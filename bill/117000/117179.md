 B. On December 17, 2009, the Owners submitted to the City of Seattle an application under Project No. 3010378 for a contract rezone of the Rezone Area from Lowrise 3 (LR3) to Midrise with a 60 foot height limit (MR-60). The purpose of the application is to allow the Rezone Area to be used for multifamily residential development and a small commercial space.

 C. Seattle Municipal Code (SMC) Section 23.34.004 allows the City to approve a contract rezone subject to "self- imposed restrictions upon the use and development of the property in order to ameliorate adverse impacts which could occur from unrestricted use and development permitted in the zone."

 NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the mutual agreements contained herein, the parties agree as follows:

 AGREEMENT

 Section 1. Agreement. Pursuant to SMC Section 23.34.004, the Owners hereby covenant, bargain and agree, on behalf of themselves and their successors and assigns, that they will comply with the following limitations and conditions in consideration of the rezone of the Rezone Area from Lowrise 3 (LR3) to Midrise with a 60 foot height limit (MR-60):

 General conditions:

 1) Approval of the rezone shall be conditioned upon the development of the proposed project in accordance with the final approved Master Use Permit drawings, dated June 9, 2010, which substantially conform to the conditions established during the design review process, including the structure design, structure height, building materials, landscaping, street improvements, parking lot design and layout, signage, and site lighting.

 2) The operation of any form of "drinking establishment" (as that term is defined in SMC Section 23.84A.010) shall be prohibited on the site.

 SEPA conditions -- prior to issuance of any construction, shoring or grading permits:

 3) The Owners shall provide to the DPD Land Use Planner for approval a Construction Management Plan that identifies construction worker parking and construction material staging areas; truck access routes to and from the site for excavation and construction phases; and sidewalk and street closures with neighborhood notice and posting procedures.

 4) The Owners shall provide to the DPD Land Use Planner for approval a Construction Noise Management Plan. The Plan shall include a discussion on management of construction-related noise, efforts to mitigate noise impacts, and community outreach efforts to allow people within the immediate area of the project to have opportunities to contact the site to express concern about noise. Activities outside the above-stated restrictions may be authorized upon approval of the Plan to address mitigation of noise impacts resulting from all construction activities. Elements of noise mitigation may be incorporated into any Construction Management Plans required to mitigate any short-term transportation impacts that result from the project.

 SEPA conditions -- during construction:

 5) The hours of construction activity shall be limited to non-holiday weekdays between the hours of 7:00 a.m. and 6:00 p.m. and between the hours of 9:00 a.m. and 6:00 p.m. on Saturdays (except that grading, delivery and pouring of cement and similar noisy activities shall be prohibited on Saturdays). This condition may be modified by DPD to allow work of an emergency nature. This condition may also be modified to permit low noise exterior work (e.g., installation of landscaping) after approval from DPD.

 6) For the duration of the construction activity, the Owners/responsible party shall cause construction truck trips to cease during the hours between 4:00 p.m. and 6:00 p.m. on weekdays.

 Design Review condition -- prior to the issuance of any Certificate of Occupancy:

 7) The Owners shall arrange for an inspection with the DPD Land Use Planner to verify that the construction of the buildings with siting, materials, and architectural details is substantially the same as those documented in the approved plans dated June 9, 2010.

 Section 2. Agreement Runs With the Land. This Agreement shall be recorded in the records of King County by the City Clerk. The covenants hereof shall be deemed to attach to and run with the land and shall be binding upon the Owners, their heirs, successors and assigns, and shall apply to after- acquired title of the Owners of the Property.

 Section 3. Termination. The covenants herein and the rezone shall expire six (6) years from the effective date of approval, unless, within the six (6) year period, an application is filed for a Master Use Permit, which permit is subsequently issued. The rezone remains in effect during this period unless revoked pursuant to SMC Section 23.34.004.

 Section 4. Amendment. This Agreement may be amended or modified by agreement between Owners and the City; provided, such amendment agreement shall be approved by the legislative authority of the City by ordinance.

 Section 5. Exercise of Police Power. Nothing in this Agreement shall prevent the City Council from making such further amendments to the Seattle Municipal Code or Land Use Code as it may deem necessary in the public interest.

 Section 6. No Precedent. The conditions contained in this Agreement are based on the unique circumstances applicable to this Property and this Agreement is not intended to establish precedent for other rezones in the surrounding area.

 Section 7. Benefited. This Agreement is made for the benefit of the City and for the benefit of the owners of property within 300 feet of the Rezone Area and either the City or any such property owners may institute and prosecute any proceeding at law or in equity to enforce this Agreement.

 Section 8. Repeal as Additional Remedy. Owners acknowledge that compliance with the conditions of this Agreement is a condition of the subject rezone and that if Owners avail themselves of the benefits of this rezone but then fail to comply with the conditions of this Agreement with the City, in addition to pursuing any other remedy, the City may revoke the rezone by ordinance and require the use of the Rezone Area to conform to the requirements of the Lowrise 3 (LR3) zone.
