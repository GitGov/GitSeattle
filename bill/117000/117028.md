Any cause of action, claim or dispute that either Party may have against the other Party arising out of or relating to this Agreement, including the interpretation of the terms of this Agreement or any applicable law affecting this Agreement, the transactions contemplated hereunder, or a breach, termination or validity thereof ("Dispute") shall be settled in accordance with the procedures described in this section 6.

 B. The Parties shall attempt in good faith to resolve any Dispute promptly by discussions between representatives of each Party who have authority to settle the Dispute. Either Party may give to the other Party notice (a "Dispute Notice") of any Dispute not resolved in the normal course of business. Within five (5) days after delivery of such notice, the representatives shall agree upon a mutually acceptable time and place to meet and shall meet at the time and place agreed, and thereafter as often as they reasonably deem necessary, to exchange relevant information and to attempt to resolve the Dispute. The first such meeting shall take place within thirty (30) days of the Dispute Notice. If a Party intends to be accompanied at any meeting by an attorney, the other Party shall be given at least three business days' notice of that intention and may also be accompanied by an attorney. All discussions pursuant to this section 6 shall be treated as compromise and settlement negotiations for the purposes of applicable rules of evidence and procedure.

 C. If the Parties are unable to resolve the Dispute within thirty (30) days of the first meeting (or such longer period to which the Parties both agree), either Party may require the other to submit to non- binding mediation with the assistance of a neutral, unaffiliated mediator. The mediator shall be knowledgeable in electric utility matters, including electric transmission and bulk power issues, and shall not have any current or past substantial business or financial relationships with any party to the mediator (except as a prior mediator).

 D. If the Parties are unable to resolve the Dispute through the foregoing non-binding procedures, each Party shall have the full right to seek resolution of the Dispute through legal action. Any lawsuit relating to a Dispute arising out of or relating to this Agreement that is not resolved by the non- binding procedures provided above must be brought in a state or federal court located in King County, Washington.

 E. Notwithstanding the Dispute resolution provisions of this section 6, either Party may bring an action in a court of competent jurisdiction in an effort to enforce the provisions of this section 6 and to seek injunctive relief to protect the Party's rights pending resolution of a Dispute pursuant to this section 6.

 F. Each Party shall be responsible for its own costs incurred during the foregoing non-binding procedures and for one half the cost of the single mediator jointly chosen by the Parties.

 SECTION 7. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY

 THE OBLIGATIONS EXPRESSLY UNDERTAKEN BY EACH PARTY IN THIS AGREEMENT ARE IN LIEU OF, AND EACH PARTY HEREBY DISCLAIMS, ALL REPRESENTATIONS (OTHER THAN THOSE EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT) AND WARRANTIES, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, SUITABILITY, DURABILITY, CONDITION, QUALITY OF PROJECT MATERIALS AND EQUIPMENT AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. EACH PARTY SPECIFICALLY WAIVES ALL RIGHT TO MAKE ANY CLAIM AGAINST THE OTHER PARTY FOR BREACH OF ANY WARRANTY, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY WARRANTY OF THE PROJECT ENGINEERING, MATERIALS OR EQUIPMENT.

 SECTION 8. MISCELLANEOUS

 A. Neither Party shall voluntarily sell, assign, encumber, dispose of or otherwise transfer this Agreement or any right, interest or benefit under this Agreement without the prior written consent of the other, which consent shall not be unreasonably denied, delayed or withheld; provided however, that City Light hereby consents to any such sale, assignment, encumbrance, disposition or transfer by PSE to (a) a successor in operation of all or substantially all of the properties of PSE or (b) any holder (or the trustee of any holder) of the debt of PSE pursuant to the terms of a mortgage, trust, security agreement, indenture or other instrument of indebtedness to which PSE and such holder (or such trustee) are parties, as security for bonds or other indebtedness of PSE, past or future. Neither the pledge, mortgage or grant of any lien for security by PSE of any of its rights in this Agreement or any right, interest or benefit that PSE may have under this Agreement, nor the execution of a pledge, mortgage, security agreement, indenture or trust deed or a judicial or foreclosure sale made thereunder, shall be deemed a voluntary transfer within the meaning of this section 8, paragraph A. No assignment by either Party shall relieve or release it to any extent of any of its obligations hereunder. Subject to the foregoing restrictions, this Agreement shall be fully binding upon, inure to the benefit of and be legally enforceable by the Parties and their respective successors, assigns and legal representatives.

 provided, however, that PSE does not so release any City Beneficiary to the extent that any such claim, loss, injury, harm, liability, damage, cost, charge or expense arises or results from or is caused by any Willful Action or the negligence (whether active, passive or imputed) of such City Beneficiary.

 6.2 The City hereby releases each of PSE, its successors and assigns, and the respective directors, officers, employees, agents and representatives of PSE and its successors and assigns (each, a "PSE Beneficiary") from any and all claims, losses, injuries, harm, liabilities, damages, costs, charges and expenses (including, without limitation, reasonable attorneys' fees) incurred by the City in connection with performance of this Agreement in accordance with its terms or arising from or in connection with any of the following:

Neither the pledge, mortgage or grant of any lien for security by PSE of any of its rights in this Agreement or any right, interest or benefit that PSE may have under this Agreement, nor the execution of a pledge, mortgage, security agreement, indenture or trust deed or a judicial or foreclosure sale made thereunder, shall be deemed a voluntary transfer within the meaning of this section 8.6. No assignment by either Party shall relieve or release it to any extent of any of its obligations hereunder.

 8.11 No Retail Services. Nothing contained in this Agreement shall grant any rights to, or obligate either Party to provide, any services hereunder directly to or for retail customers of the other Party.

 8.12 No Third Party Beneficiaries. Except as expressly provided with respect to any City Beneficiary, any PSE Beneficiary or any First Party Beneficiary in sections 6.1, 6.2 and 6.3, this Agreement shall not be construed to create rights in, or to grant remedies to, any third party as a beneficiary of this Agreement or of any duty, obligation or undertaking established herein.
