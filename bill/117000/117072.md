</table> THIS PROPERTY USE AND DEVELOPMENT AGREEMENT (the "Agreement") is executed this \_\_\_\_\_ day of \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_, 2010, in favor of the CITY OF SEATTLE, a Washington municipal corporation (the "City"), by the Seattle Office of Housing, a Department of the City of Seattle, a Washington municipal corporation (the "Owner").

 RECITALS

 A. The Owner is the owner of that certain real property (the "Property") in the City of Seattle, legally described in Exhibit A attached hereto and incorporated herein by this reference.

 B. On September 2, 2009, the Owner submitted to the City an application for a Master Use Permit (MUP), MUP No. 3009796, to rezone the Property from Neighborhood Commercial 2 Pedestrian Overlay (NC2P) with a 40-foot height limit, to NC2P with a 65-foot height limit. The purpose of the application is to facilitate the development of affordable housing on the Property.

 C. Seattle Municipal Code (SMC) Section 23.34.004 allows the City to approve a contract rezone subject to "self-imposed restrictions upon the use and development of the property in order to ameliorate adverse impacts that could occur from unrestricted use and development permitted by development regulations otherwise applicable after the rezone."

 NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the mutual agreements contained herein, the parties agree as follows:

 AGREEMENT

 Section 1. Agreement. Pursuant to 23.34.004, the Owner hereby covenants, bargains and agrees, on behalf of itself and its successors and assigns, that it will comply with the following limitations and conditions in consideration of the rezone of the Property from Neighborhood Commercial 2 Pedestrian Overlay (NC2P) with a 40-foot height limit, to NC2P with a 65-foot height limit:

 Future development of the Property is restricted to a project developed in substantial accordance with the final approved Master Use Permit drawings for MUP Application No. 3009796 dated September 7, 2010 and September 8, 2010, and included as Exhibit 19 in Council's record under Clerk's File 310179 as modified by design review conditions including but not limited to structure design, structure height, building materials, landscaping, street improvements, parking design and layout, signage and site lighting that are described in Hearing Examiner's Exhibit 2, the Department of Planning and Development's recommendation dated September 16, 2010.

 Section 2. Agreement Runs With the Land. This Agreement shall be recorded in the records of King County by the City Clerk. The covenants hereof shall be deemed to attach to and run with the Property and shall be binding upon the Owner, its heirs, successors and assigns, and shall apply to after-acquired title of the Owner of the Property.

 Section 3. Termination. The covenants herein and the rezone shall expire two years from the issuance of a Master Use Permit or as provided in Seattle Municipal Code Section 23.76.032. If the Master Use permit is issued and the Owner has received a certificate of occupancy for the permitted structure prior to expiration of the Master Use Permit, the rezone remains in effect unless revoked pursuant to Section 23.34.004.

 Section 4. Amendment. This Agreement may be amended or modified by written agreement between the Owner and the City; provided, such amendment shall be approved by the legislative authority of the City by ordinance.

 Section 5. Exercise of Police Power. Nothing in this Agreement prevents the City Council from making such further amendments to the Seattle Municipal Code or Land Use Code as it may deem necessary in the public interest.

 Section 6. No Precedent. The conditions contained in this Agreement are based on the unique circumstances applicable to this Property and this Agreement is not intended to establish precedent for other rezones in the surrounding area.

 Section 7. Benefited. This Agreement is made for the benefit of the City and for the benefit of the owners of property within 300 feet of the Property and either the City or any such property owners may institute and prosecute any proceeding at law or in equity to enforce this Agreement.

 Section 8. Repeal as Additional Remedy. Owner acknowledges that compliance with the conditions of this Agreement is a condition of the rezone and that if Owner or its successor avails itself of the benefits of this rezone but then fails to comply with the conditions of this Agreement with the City, in addition to pursuing any other remedy, the City may revoke the rezone by ordinance and require the use of the Property to conform to the requirements of the Neighborhood Commercial 2 Pedestrian Overlay (NC2P) with a 40-foot height limit.
