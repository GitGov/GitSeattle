 ORDINANCE _________________

 AN ORDINANCE declaring the former sites of Fire Station 37 and Fire Station 38 surplus and authorizing the Director of the Department of Finance and Administrative Services to sell these sites through an open competitive process.

 WHEREAS, the Fire Facilities and Emergency Response Levy Program ("Fire Facilities Program"), proposed under Ordinance 121230, was approved by Seattle voters on November 4, 2003; and

 WHEREAS, the Fire Facilities Program included new facilities for Fire Station 37 and 38, and neither the Seattle Fire Department nor the Department of Finance and Administrative Services (FAS) have current or future needs for the former station facilities; and

 WHEREAS, the funding plan for the Fire Facilities Program included revenues from sales of property no longer required for operations of the Seattle Fire Department; and

 WHEREAS, by Resolution 30862, the City adopted amended Procedures for the Evaluation of the Reuse and Disposal of the City's Real Property, ("Procedures"), which established a uniform evaluation process for the reuse or disposal of real property the City owns in fee simple, including certain public notice and involvement procedures for decisions classified as complex; and

 WHEREAS, no other City department or other government agencies requested jurisdiction over, or proposed a public use for, either of these properties; and

 WHEREAS, the zoning and historic designation of these fire stations significantly limits the development potential and re-use possibilities for the sites; and

 WHEREAS, the public comments received by the Department of Finance and Administrative Services through its public notification and comment solicitation process are broadly consistent with the limited development potential of the sites and the intent to use revenues from the sale of the properties to support the Fire Levy Program; and

 WHEREAS, in view of the consistency of public comments with a public sale, the Executive proposes streamlining the disposition process, has included this streamlined approach in the Public Involvement Plan, which is included Clerk File 311622, and has proposed legislation authorizing the sale of the two properties at the same time that it forwarded Clerk File 311622to the Council for review; and

 WHEREAS, public comments received as a result of circulating the Public Involvement Plan to interested neighbors and the community, signs posted on the fire station properties and related print and video media coverage were also consistent with the sale of these properties; and

 WHEREAS, Section 5.H of the Procedures recognizes the City Council may approve alternative procedures for the reuse or disposal evaluation process for specific properties, and that such alternative procedures do not set precedent for subsequent dispositions; and

 WHEREAS, it is in the interest of the City and the general public to sell these two fire station properties rapidly to avoid negative impacts on neighborhoods from vacant properties; NOW, THEREFORE,

 BE IT ORDAINED BY THE CITY OF SEATTLE AS FOLLOWS:

 Section 1. The City of Seattle approves the steps taken as documented in the Public Involvement Section of the Final Report, which is included in Clerk File 311622, for each of the following described properties in King County, Washington:

 PMA 134 (former Fire Station #37):

 Lots 14-15, Block 1, Sunrise Heights Addition to the City of Seattle, according to plat thereof recorded in Volume 23 of Plats, page 39, records of King County, Washington.

 PMA No. 135 (former Fire Station #38):

 Lots 14-15, Block 8, University View Addition to the City of Seattle, according to the Plat thereof, recorded in Volume 13 of Plats, page 96, records of King County, Washington.

 as the alternate procedure to evaluate and dispose of the two former fire station properties pursuant to Section 5.H of the Procedures adopted as amended by Resolution 30862.

 Section 2. The properties identified in Section 1 are hereby found and declared to be no longer required for municipal purposes and are hereby declared surplus to the City's needs.

 Section 3. The Director of the Department of Finance and Administrative Services or his designee is authorized to offer the properties identified in Section 1 for sale by a competitive process, and subject to the Director's approval, to accept the best offer for each property.

 Section 4. The Director of the Department of Finance and Administrative Services or his designee is authorized to negotiate a purchase and sale agreement or agreements and any ancillary documents to transfer the properties to the selected purchaser or purchasers.

 Section 5. Proceeds from the sales authorized herein shall be used first to reimburse costs incurred and paid by the Department of Finance and Administrative Services in connection with the sale. The remaining proceeds shall be deposited in the 2003 Fire Facilities Subfund (34440).

 Section 6. Pending disposition, FAS may authorize short- term uses not to exceed six months in length unless terminable upon 90 days notice.

 Section 7. This ordinance shall take effect and be in force 30 days after its approval by the Mayor, but if not approved and returned by the Mayor within ten days after presentation, it shall take effect as provided by Seattle Municipal Code Section 1.04.020.
