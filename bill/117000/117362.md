 3.53.020 Membership

 A. The Commission is comprised of 10 members. Appointments shall be made to ensure that varied economic perspectives are represented, including business size, industry type, organized labor, neighborhood business, minority-owned business, woman-owned business, local economic professionals, and representatives of post-high school educational institutions.

 1. All positions are numbered one through 10. Individuals shall be appointed into those numbered positions. Members in odd numbered positions shall be appointed by a majority vote of the Council.

All positions shall be filled as soon as practicable after the Council and Mayor have authorized the creation of the Commission.

 2. For the initial round of appointments all positions will be for one year. After the first year the positions will be staggered: positions one through five will serve one-year terms, positions five through ten will serve two-year terms. After the conclusion of these terms, all subsequent terms of each position shall be for two years. A commission member whose term has expired shall continue to hold office until a successor has been appointed and qualified. No members shall serve more than two consecutive terms.

Staff from the Office of Economic Development may provide appointment recommendations to both the Mayor and City Council.

 3.53.040 Compensation

 Members serve without compensation.

 3.53.050 Duties and functions

 A. The duties of the Commission include, but are not limited to, the following:

This includes review of policy proposals brought forward by the City, as well as ones identified by the Commission.
