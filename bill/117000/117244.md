 Catherine Cornwall CJCS King County Jail ILA ORD July 19, 2011 Version #2

 Interlocal Agreement Between

 KingCounty and The City of Seattle

 for Jail Services

 THIS AGREEMENT is dated effective as of the 1st day of January 2012. The Parties to this Agreement are KingCounty, a Washington municipal corporation and legal subdivision of the State of Washington (the "County") and The City of Seattle, a Washington municipal corporation (the "City").

 WHEREAS, the City and County recognize the benefits of entering into a long-term contract based on shared interests in effectively and efficiently managing jail populations and capacity, in seeking solutions that safely divert low risk populations or manage them in alternatives to secure detention, and in ensuring the availability of sufficient jail capacity for those who pose a serious risk to the public safety; and

 WHEREAS, this Agreement is made in accordance with the Interlocal Cooperation Act (RCW Chapter 39.34) and the City and County Jails Act (RCW Chapter 70.48);

 NOW THEREFORE, in consideration of the promises, payments, covenants and agreements contained in this Agreement, the parties agree as follows:

 1.  Definitions : Unless the context clearly shows another usage is intended, the following terms shall have these meanings in this Agreement:

 1.1 "Agreement" means this Interlocal Agreement by and between KingCounty and the City for Jail Services and any amendments to this Agreement.

 1.2 "Booking" means registering, screening and examining persons for confinement in the Jail or assignment to WER ; inventorying and safekeeping personal property of such persons; maintaining all computerized records of arrest; performing warrant checks; and all other activities associated with processing a person for confinement in Jail or assignment to WER.

 1.3 "Booking Fee" means the fee incurred for booking City Inmates, as further described in Section 4 and Exhibit III, Section 2.

 1.4 "Business Day" means Monday through Friday, 8:00 a.m. until 5:00 p.m., except holidays and County-designated furlough days.

 1.5 "Certification of Housing Use" means a Notification provided by the City to the County, in the form generally set forth in Exhibit V, confirming whether the City has housed, or intends to house, all City Detainees and City Pre-Trial Detainees requiring Secure Detention in the Jail, or whether the City will be utilizing its own or third-party operated facilities for some of its Secure Detention needs.

 1.6 "City Detainee" means a person booked into or housed in a Secure Detention facility such as the Jail but also including any other Secure Detention facility not operated by or on behalf of the County, which individual would, if housed in the Jail, qualify as a City Inmate.

 1.7 "City Inmate" means a person booked into or housed in the Jail when a City charge is the principal basis for booking or confining that person.

 A. A City charge is the principal basis for booking or confining a person where one or more of the following applies, whether pre-trial or post-trial. (See Exhibit I for further billable charge rules.):

 1.7.1 The person is booked or confined by reason of committing or allegedly committing a misdemeanor or gross misdemeanor offense within the City's jurisdiction, and:

 1.7.1.1 the case is referred to the City, through its City Attorney or contracted attorney, for a filing decision; or

 1.7.1.2 the case is referred to the City, through its City Attorney or contracted attorney, who then refers the case to the County Prosecutor for a filing decision per section 1.7.2; or

 1.7.1.3 the case is filed by the City, through its City Attorney or contracted attorney, whether filed under state law or city ordinance.

 1.7.2 The person is booked or confined by reason of committing or allegedly committing a misdemeanor or gross misdemeanor offense, whether filed under state law or city ordinance, within the City's jurisdiction and the case is referred by the City, through its City attorney or contracted attorney, to the County prosecutor and filed by the County prosecutor as a misdemeanor in district court due to a conflict or other reason but excluding a case filed in a regionally-funded mental health court as described in Section 1.7.10.

 1.7.3 The person is booked or confined by reason of a Court warrant issued either by the City's Municipal Court or other court when acting as the City's Municipal Court;

 1.7.4 The person is booked or confined by reason of a Court order issued either by the City's Municipal Court or other court when acting as the City's Municipal Court; or,

 1.7.5 The person is booked or confined by reason of subsections 1.7.1 through 1.7.4 above in combination with charges, investigation of charges, and/or warrants of other governments, and the booking or confinement by reason of subsections 1.7.1 through 1.7.4 above is determined to be the most serious charge in accordance with Exhibit I.

 1.7.6 The person has been booked or confined for reasons other than subsections 1.7.1 through 1.7.5 and would be released or transferred but for the City having requested that the County continue to confine the person.

 B. A City charge is not the principal basis for confining a person where:

 1.7.7 The person is booked or confined exclusively or in combination with other charges by reason of a felony charge or felony investigation.

 1.7.8 The person is confined exclusively or in combination with other charges by reason of a felony charge or felony investigation that has been reduced to a State misdemeanor or gross misdemeanor.

 1.7.9 The City has requested the transfer of the person to another jail facility not operated by King County and the County denies the request, unless one or more of the transfer exception criteria listed in Attachment I-2 are met, in which case the person remains a City Inmate. The billing status of the person will change to no longer be the City's responsibility effective the calendar day following the day that the County denies the transfer request. If the County thereafter determines that it no longer needs to detain the person and the person would as a result become a City Inmate, then the County will provide notice to the City that it will become billable for the Inmate. For details on notice and billing, see Attachment I-2.

 1.7.10 The person is booked or confined by reason of committing a misdemeanor or gross misdemeanor offense, whether filed under state law or city ordinance, within the City's jurisdiction and the case is referred by the City attorney or contracted attorney to the County prosecutor and filed by the County prosecutor as a misdemeanor in the mental health court (or successor) for so long as the operations of such court are substantially funded by special regional funds (for example, Mental Illness and Drug Dependency sales tax levy) or other regional funding as the County may determine. The County shall provide the City thirty (30) days Notification before changing the status of a regionally-funded mental health court to local funding status. The City is not billable for cases filed by the County prosecutor into mental health court prior to changing to local funding status.

 1.8 "City Pre-Trial Detainee" means a City Detainee who has not been sentenced by a court of competent jurisdiction for a City charge on which he or she is being detained or held.

 1.10 "Community Corrections Programs" means programs designed as alternatives to, or as rehabilitative or treatment in lieu of, Secure Detention, operated by or on behalf of the DAJD's Community Corrections Division, or its successor. Upon the date of the execution of this Agreement, Community Corrections Programs include Work and Education Release (WER), Electronic Home Detention, Community Work Program and Community Center for Alternative Programs (CCAP).

 1.11 "Continuity of Care Records" means an Inmate's diagnosis, list of current medications, treatments, PPD (tuberculosis screening test) results and scheduled appointments or follow- ups.

 1.12 "CountyInmate" means any Inmate that is not a City Inmate.

 1.13 "DAJD" means the King County Department of Adult and Juvenile Detention or its successor agency.

 1.14 "Fees and Charges" are the Fees and Charges imposed as described in Section 4 and Exhibit III.

 1.15 "Force Majeure" means war, civil unrest, and any natural event outside of the party's reasonable control, including fire, storm, flood, earthquake or other act of nature.

 1.16 "Inmate" means a person booked into or housed in the Jail.

 1.17 The first "Inmate Day" means confinement for more than six (6) hours measured from the time such Inmate or City WER Participant is first presented to and accepted by the Jail for housing in the Jail or WER until the person is released, provided that an arrival on or after six (6) o'clock p.m. and continuing into the succeeding day shall be considered one day. The second and each subsequent Inmate Day means confinement for any portion of a calendar day after the first Inmate Day. For persons confined to the Jail for the purpose of mandatory DUI sentences, "Inmate Day" means confinement in accordance with Exhibit II.

 1.18 "JAG" means the Jail Agreement Administration Group created pursuant to Section 10 of this Agreement.

 1.19 "Jail" means a place owned or operated by or under contract to the County primarily designed, staffed, and used for the housing, in full confinement, of adults charged or convicted of a criminal offense; for the punishment, correction, and rehabilitation of offenders charged or convicted of a criminal offense; for confinement during a criminal investigation or for civil detention to enforce a court order, all where such place is structured and operated to ensure such individuals remain on the premises 24-hours a day (excluding time for court appearances, court approved off- premises trips, or medical treatment). Inmates housed in the Jail are considered to be in Secure Detention as defined in Section 1.37. Upon the date of the execution of the Agreement, Jail includes the King County Correctional Facility and the detention facility at the Maleng Regional JusticeCenter.

 1.20 "Jail Bed Expansion Project" means an expansion of the County's Secure Detention bed capacity implemented per Section 7 of this Agreement.

 1.21 "Jail Bed Expansion Charge" means the charge payable by the City in connection with a Jail Bed Expansion Project, per Section 7 of this Agreement.

 1.22 "Maintenance Charge" is the daily housing charge incurred for City Inmates housed in Jail as further described in Section 4 and Exhibit III, Section 1.a.

 1.23 "Medical Inmate" means an Inmate clinically determined by the Seattle-King County Department of Public Health, or its successor charged with the same duties, as needing the level of services provided in the Jail's infirmary. If an Inmate is moved to the general population then the Inmate is no longer considered a Medical Inmate.

An Inmate may receive Offsite Medical Care that triggers an Offsite Medical Care Charge without being otherwise classified as a Medical Inmate or Psychiatric Inmate (e.g., some Inmates held in the general population receive offsite medical care that will result in Offsite Medical Care Charges being incurred).

 1.27 "Psychiatric Inmate" means either an Acute Psychiatric Inmate or a Non-Acute Psychiatric Inmate, as defined below.

 1.27.1 A "Non-Acute Psychiatric Inmate" is an Inmate clinically determined by the Seattle-King County Department of Public Health, or its successor charged with the same duties, as needing Psychiatric Care Services (as further described in Exhibit III, Attachment III-2) and housed outside the Jail's acute psychiatric housing units.

 1.27.2 An "Acute Psychiatric Inmate" is an inmate clinically determined by the Seattle-King County Department of Public Health, or its successor charged with the same duties, as needing the level of services provided in the Jail's acute psychiatric housing units (as further described in Exhibit III, Attachment III-2).

 1.35 "Secure Bed Floor" means the minimum number of beds in Jail for which the City will be responsible for payment of a Minimum Adjustment Charge per Exhibit III, Section 6.

 1.37 "Secure Detention" refers to a facility structured and operated for the full confinement of City Detainees to ensure such individuals remain on the premises 24-hours a day (excluding time for court appearances, court approved off- premises trips, or medical treatment), such as the Jail but also including other similar facilities that the City may elect to house City Detainees. Secure Detention in the Jail excludes City Inmates enrolled in Community Corrections Programs.

 1.38 "Surcharge" means any of the following special charges, defined in Exhibit III, Section 3 and further described in Attachment III-2: Infirmary Care Surcharge; Non-Acute Psychiatric Care Surcharge; Acute Psychiatric Care Surcharge; and 1:1 Guarding Surcharge.

For purposes of calculating the Jail Bed Expansion Surcharge, the Total Jail Bed Expansion Capital Cost is limited as described in Exhibit III, Section 5.

 1.40 "2010 Agreement" means the interlocal agreement for jail services between KingCounty and the City as executed between the County and the City effective February 1, 2010, as amended.

This Agreement shall supersede all previous contracts and agreements between the Parties relating to the Jail, WER, and any other jail services, except that any obligations contained in these previous contracts or agreements which expressly survived termination or expiration of these previous contracts or agreements shall remain in effect.

 3.  Jail and Health Services . The County shall accept City Inmates for confinement in the Jail and City WER Participants for assignment to WER, except as provided in Sections 5.4, and 6 of this Agreement. The County shall also furnish the City with Jail facilities, booking, transportation among County facilities, as determined necessary in the County's sole discretion, including the various Jail facilities, HarborviewMedicalCenter and WesternStateHospital, and custodial services, and personnel for the confinement of City Inmates at least equal to those the County provides for confinement of CountyInmates. However, the County reserves the right to operate specific programs and/or facilities exclusively for CountyInmates or persons sentenced or assigned to Community Corrections Programs. The County shall furnish to City Inmates in Secure Detention all Jail medical, dental and other health care services required to be provided pursuant to federal or state law. Also, the County shall make every reasonable effort to release a City Inmate or City WER Participant as expeditiously as possible after the County has received notice of a court order to release. Nothing in this section shall be deemed to limit the County's right to refuse to accept City Detainees for confinement in Jail or sentencing to WER when they are deemed by the County to be in need of urgent medical care.

 3.1 Upon the execution of this Agreement, the City will provide the County with a completed "Certification of Secure Housing Use," (or "Certification") using the form appended hereto as Exhibit IV and submitting it to the person specified in Section 13.10 of this Agreement. The City will thereafter provide the County with updated Certification forms as necessary to provide the County prompt notice of any changes in the status of its housing use by City Detainees, or to provide notice to the County about City Detainee status after the expiration of the time period covered by the prior Certification.

 To the extent practicable, the City will provide Certifications updating the status of City Detainees in advance of any changes in City Detainee status. In the event the County has not received an updated Certification with new information as of any July 15 or January 15, the County shall be entitled to rely on the most recently filed Certification for all purposes under this Agreement, including but not limited to the calculation of the Minimum Bed Adjustment Charge and likely Jail Secure Detention requirements of the City.

 4.  City Compensation . The City will pay the County a Booking Fee, Maintenance Charge, Minimum Bed Adjustment Charge, WER Charge, Surcharges and Offsite Medical Charges as follows (together with such other charges as may be applicable in accordance with this Agreement):

 4.1  Booking Fee . The Booking Fee shall be assessed for the booking of City Inmates by or on behalf of the City into Secure Detention in the Jail, and for the booking of City WER Participants directly reporting to WER, as further described in Exhibit III, Section 2. The Booking Fee will be annually adjusted effective each January 1st.

 4.2  Maintenance Charge . The Maintenance Charge shall be assessed for a City Inmate for each Inmate Day as provided in Exhibit III, Subsection 1.a. The Maintenance Charge will be annually adjusted effective each January 1st.

 4.2.1 The City agrees to pay for maintenance of City Inmates at a minimum level associated with the Secure Bed Floor in Attachment III-3. Accordingly, if the number of billable City Inmates falls below the prescribed level, the City will be assessed a Minimum Bed Adjustment Charge calculated and payable as described in Exhibit III, Section 6.

 4.2.2 The County will maintain its program to provide notice to the City after booking a City Inmate in order to give notice that the City Inmate has been booked and to provide the opportunity for release to the City if the City so desires. Such action will take place as soon as reasonably possible but no later than the next business day after booking. A City Inmate released within six hours of booking will result in no Maintenance Charges.

 4.2.3 The County will maintain its program to provide notice to the City of the billing status of its Inmates for the prior calendar day in cases where confinement is the result of multiple warrants or sentences from two or more jurisdictions. As of the date of this Agreement, this notice is provided to the City once each business day when applicable. The intent of this program is to allow the City to take custody of a City Inmate if it so desires after the other jurisdictional warrants are resolved and thereby prevent unnecessary Maintenance Charges.

 4.2.4 The Parties may amend the notice requirements of Sections 4.2.2 and 4.2.3 by administrative agreement signed by both the Mayor of the City of Seattle and the King County Executive.

 4.3  WER Charge . The WER Charge shall be assessed for a City WER Participant for each Inmate Day as provided in Exhibit III, Subsection 1.b. The WER charge will be annually adjusted effective each January 1st.

 4.3.1  Access to and Charges for City Inmate Use of Community Corrections Programs . The Parties agree to discuss in good faith the ability for the City to access Community Corrections Programs in addition to WER, and to negotiate charges for such access. Any agreement between the Parties with respect to access and charges for Community Corrections Programs in addition to WER shall be enacted through an amendment to this Agreement.

 4.4  Surcharges and Offsite Medical Charges . In addition to the Booking Fee, Maintenance Charge, Minimum Bed Adjustment Charge, WER Charge and any other charges agreed to per Section 4.3.1, the City will be charged for Offsite Medical Charges and Surcharges as detailed in Exhibit III, Section 3 and 4.

 4.4.1  Proposed Notice of Certain Surcharges . The County intends to provide or make available to the City timely notice of occurrences when a City Inmate is admitted to Harborview Medical Center or other offsite medical institution, or is receiving infirmary care or psychiatric care that will subject a City to Surcharges. Notice provided or made available will be based on information known to DAJD at the time (since billing status of an Inmate may be changed retroactively based on new information or other factors). The County intends to provide or make available this notice within 2 business days following the day in which the chargeable event occurs and will make good faith efforts to provide notice sooner if practicable. The County will make good faith efforts to try to institute a means to provide notice to the City within 24 hours of the admittance of a City Inmate to Harborview Medical Center or other offsite medical institution. The County's failure to provide or make available notice or develop quicker means to provide notice to the City as detailed above shall not excuse the City from financial responsibility for related Offsite Medical Charges or Surcharges, and shall not be a basis for imposing financial responsibility for related Offsite Medical Charges or Surcharges on the County.

 5.  Billing and Billing Dispute Resolution Procedures.

 5.1 The County shall transmit billings to the City monthly. Within forty-five (45) days after receipt, the City shall pay the full amount billed or withhold a portion thereof and provide the County written notice meeting the requirements of Section 5.2.1 specifying the total amount withheld and the grounds for withholding such amount, together with payment of the remainder of the amount billed (if any amount remains). Notwithstanding the foregoing, the County shall bill the City for Offsite Medical Charges as such charges are periodically received by the County from third party medical institutions or other offsite medical providers, and further, the County shall bill the Minimum Bed Payment Adjustment Charge per the terms of Exhibit III, Section 6. Offsite Medical Charges and Minimum Bed Payment Charges shall be due within such time and subject to such withholding and dispute resolution procedures as otherwise provided in this Section 5.

 5.2 Withholding of any amount billed or alleging a violation related to billing provisions of this Agreement shall constitute a dispute, which shall be resolved as follows:

 5.2.1 The County shall respond in writing to billing disputes within 60-days of receipt of such disputes by the DAJD billing offices. To ensure the soonest start to the 60-day timeline, the City should send billing disputes directly to the DAJD billing office by fax or U.S. mail, rather than to any other County office or officer. The DAJD billing office address as of the date of this Amendment is:

 KC DAJD

 Attn: Finance - Inmate Billing

 500 5th Avenue

 Seattle, WA98104 FAX Number: 206-296-0570

 5.2.2 Thereafter, the County and the City shall attempt to resolve the dispute by negotiation. If such negotiation is unsuccessful, either Party may refer the dispute to JAG for resolution. In the event JAG is unable to resolve the dispute within 30-days of referral, either Party may pursue the dispute resolution mechanisms outlined in Section 11.

 5.3 Any amount withheld from a billing, which is determined to be owed to the County pursuant to the dispute resolution procedure described herein, shall be paid by the City within thirty (30) days of the date of the negotiated resolution or appeal determination.

 5.4 If the City fails to pay a billing within 45-days of receipt, the County will provide the City with a notice of its failure to pay and the City shall have ten (10) days from receipt of such notice to cure non-payment. Any undisputed billing amount not paid by the City within sixty (60) days of receipt of the billing, and any amounts found to be owing to the County as a result of the billing dispute resolution procedure that are not paid within thirty (30) days of resolution, shall be conclusively established as a lawful debt owed to the County by the City, shall be binding on the Parties and shall not be subject to legal question either directly or collaterally. In the event the City fails to cure its nonpayment, the City shall be deemed to have voluntarily waived its right to house City Inmates in the Jail or be assigned to WER and, at the County's request, will remove City Inmates already housed in the Jail or assigned to WER within thirty (30) days. Thereafter, the County, at its sole discretion, may accept no further City Inmates or City WER Participants until all outstanding bills are paid. This provision shall not limit the City's ability to challenge or dispute any billings that have been paid by the City.

 5.5 The County may charge an interest rate equal to the interest rate on the monthly County investment earnings on any undisputed billing amount not paid by the City within forty- five (45) days of receipt of the billing, and any amounts found to be owing to the County as a result of the billing dispute resolution procedure.

 5.6 Each Party may examine the other's books and records to verify charges. If an examination reveals an improper charge, the next billing statement will be adjusted appropriately. Disputes on matters related to this Agreement which are revealed by an audit shall be resolved pursuant to Section 5.2.

 6.  Secure Beds for Seattle Inmates: Cap and Floor . The City may house City Inmates in Secure Detention within the Jail in an aggregate number, according to the Jail's Official Daily Population Count, equal to or less than the number shown in Column 3 "Secure Bed Cap" in Attachment III-3 in the corresponding calendar year, as further described in this Section.

 6.1 The County will provide notice to the City if the City has exceeded the Secure Bed Cap, by providing notice to the person or persons identified by the official Notification recipient designated in Section 13.10 of this Agreement (if other than the individual identified in Section 13.10). After the City has exceeded the Secure Bed Cap for four (4) consecutive days, the County may either decide to continue to house City Inmates in excess of the Secure Bed Cap or refuse to accept bookings from the City. Notwithstanding the terms of the preceding sentence, if at any time the County determines that housing City Inmates in number above the Secure Bed Cap jeopardizes its ability to operate its jail facilities in a safe and secure manner, the County may refuse bookings for City Detainees until such time as the number of City Inmates is reduced below the Secure Bed Cap.

 6.2  Adjustments to the Secure Bed Cap and Floor . The Secure Bed Cap and Floor may be increased or decreased effective January 1 of any calendar year in accordance with the terms and conditions of this Section.

 6.2.1  Decrease in Secure Bed Cap and FloorWhenCity Utilizing Secure Detention Facilities in Addition to Jail . If the City's Certification of Secure Housing Use (in form of Exhibit IV to this Agreement) confirms that the City is or will be housing City Detainees requiring Secure Detention in facilities in addition to Jail from and after the requested effective date of a Secure Bed Cap and Floor reduction, the City will be granted a reduction in its Secure Bed Cap and Floor if the following conditions are also met:

 a. The County has not issued to the City a Notification of Intent to Proceed with Jail Bed Expansion Project per Section 7.

 b. The City submits the request for the reduction at least eighteen (18) months before the proposed January 1 effective date, by completing and submitting a Secure Bed Cap and Floor Adjustment Request Form (Exhibit V) specifying the amount of the requested decrease in the Secure Cap and Floor for all remaining years of the Agreement and delivering it to the person designated in Section 13.10 of the Agreement; provided that the County in its sole discretion may agree to a shorter Notification period.

 c. The Secure Bed Floor requested for any calendar year is equal to or greater than the Minimum Secure Bed Floor as shown on Column 5 of Attachment III-3 (Secure Bed Cap and Floor for Seattle) for each corresponding Calendar Year.

 d. The Secure Bed Cap requested is 30% higher than the Secure Bed Floor for each corresponding Calendar Year.

 e. Notwithstanding subsections a and b above, if the County has issued a Notification of Projected Need for Capital Expansion Project indicating that the Jail Bed Expansion Charge is expected to be payable by the City in less than 18 months from the date of such Notification, the City shall be considered to have issued a timely request for a decrease in the secure cap and floor under this Section 6.2.1 if the City files such request otherwise meeting the terms of this Section 6.2.1 within 30 days of receipt of the County's Notification of Projected Need for Capital Expansion Project. The City's request for a Secure Bed Cap and Floor reduction, if and as granted, shall become effective on the January 1 closest to the date that is 18 months following the date of issuance of the Notification of Projected Need for Capital Expansion Project.

 A decrease in the Secure Bed Cap and Floor approved under this Section 6.2.1 is ongoing, that is, shall continue to be in effect for the remainder of the Agreement as shown on the approved Exhibit to the Secure Bed Cap and Floor Adjustment Request Form, unless another reduction is approved per this section or Section 6.2.2, or an increase in the Secure Bed Cap and Floor is approved per Section 6.2.3. Once a decrease in the Secure Bed Cap and Floor is granted under this Section 6.2.1, the County bed capacity removed from the Secure Bed Cap and Floor may be used for other purposes at the sole discretion of the County.

 6.2.2  Temporary (1-year) Decrease in Secure Bed Cap and FloorWhenCity Utilizing Only Jail for Secure Detention . If the City's Certification of City Secure Housing Use (in form of Exhibit IV to this Agreement) confirms that the City will be housing all City Detainees requiring Secure Detention in the Jail from and after the requested effective date of a Secure Bed Cap and Floor reduction, the City will be granted a reduction in its Secure Bed Cap and Floor if the following conditions are also met:

 a. The City requests the reduction no later than July 1st in the year before the proposed effective date, by completing and submitting a Secure Bed Cap and Floor Adjustment Request Form and delivering it to the person designated in Section 13.10 of the Agreement.

 b. The entirety of the City's Detainees requiring Secure Detention are held in the Jail during the calendar year of the requested reduction; and

 c. The Secure Bed Cap requested is 30% higher than the Reduced Bed Floor requested.

 A reduction in the Secure Bed Cap and Floor granted under this section is for a period of one (1) year. The Cap and Floor will increase automatically to the pre-reduction level on January 1 of the next calendar year unless the City has by July 1 requested another reduction in accordance with the conditions of this Section 6.2.2. Within the year of a reduction granted per this Section, the County may use beds that were previously within the Secure Cap for any other purpose, within the County's sole discretion.

 6.2.3  Increase in Secure Bed Cap and Floor . The City may request an increase in the Secure Bed Cap and Floor at least thirty-six (36) months before the requested effective date (January 1) of the increase, by completing and submitting aSecure Bed Cap and Floor Adjustment Request Form and delivering it to the person designated in Section 13.10 of this Agreement; provided that, the Secure Bed Cap requested shall in each calendar year from an after the proposed effective date of the increase be 30% higher than the Reduced Bed Floor for such calendar year; and provided further that upon the City's request, the County in its sole discretion may agree to a shorter Notification period for a Secure Bed Cap and Floor increase than 36 months. The City may request an increase for a limited term of years, after which the Secure Bed Cap and Floor will revert to the prior approved levels. The County is under no obligation to grant a request for an increase in the Secure Bed Cap and Floor. Approval of an increase in any Secure Bed Cap or Floor limit by more than 33% of the corresponding number in the Original Attachment III-3 or 110 beds, whichever is greater, shall require approval of the Parties' respective legislative bodies.

 6.2.4  Adjustment of Attachment III-3 to Reflect Reductions or Increases in Secure Bed Cap and Floor . Any increase or decrease in the Secure Bed Cap and Floor approved per this Section 6.2 shall not be effective until confirmed by the County's signature on the Secure Bed Cap and Floor Adjustment Request Form. The Request Form shall include a revised Attachment III-3, adjusting the numbers in Columns 3 and 4 in said exhibit, to reflect the change requested by the City. The County shall adjust the revised Attachment III-3 as necessary to comply with the terms of the Agreement, including but not limited to the terms of this Section 6. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the City notifies the County of its intent to house the entirety of its City Detainees requiring Secure Detention in Jail, the Parties will in good faith negotiate whether changes to the ratio between the Secure Bed Cap and Floor should be adopted by amendment to this Agreement.

 6.2.5 The Parties recognize that local policy or legislative changes could result in shifting a group of Inmates who are currently the responsibility of the County to be the responsibility of the City for purposes of the Agreement. An example of such a change is an annexation of an unincorporated area by the City. The Parties agree to work together as reasonably practicable in advance of such local policy or legislative changes to estimate the impact of such changes and to negotiate in good faith regarding any proposed change to the City's Secure Bed Cap and Floor. If the Parties are able to agree, any such changes will be made by amendment to this Agreement.

 6.3 By December 31, 2030, at the time of the Jail's Official Daily Population Count, the City agrees to reduce the number of City Inmates in the Jail to 0 and the number of City WER Participants to 0, with the exception that Inmates whose status has changed to City Inmate, or WER participants whose status has changed to City WER Participant will not be included in the calculation of the number of City Inmates or WER Participants if such individuals are removed from the Jail or WER within 72-hours of such change in status.

 For the purpose of determining the number of City Inmates and City WER Participants only, and not for billing purposes, Inmates held on multiple warrants or sentences by the County which include one or more city warrants or sentences in addition to a County and/or state warrant or sentence, and City Inmates or City WER Participants that have been booked into the Jail or WER and the City has not been notified of such booking shall not be considered a City Inmate or City WER Participant. Also, City Inmates housed in the Jail or City WER Participants assigned to WER pursuant to a reciprocal bed-use agreement will not be considered City Inmates or City WER Participants for the purpose of determining the number of City Inmates or City WER Participants.

 6.4 The City can access up to a maximum of 15 WER beds, subject to availability, on a first come, first serve basis; provided further that these beds will not be held in reserve for the City. The County may in its sole discretion provide more than 15 WER beds to City WER Participants.

 6.5 The Jail's capacity limit for Medical Inmates is thirty (30). The Jail's capacity limit for Psychiatric Inmates is one-hundred fifty-one (151). For the purpose of this Section the Medical and Psychiatric Inmate population will be determined following the definitions in Sections 1.23 and 1.27 at the time of the Jail's Official Daily Population Count.

 6.6 When the Jail has reached its capacity limit for either Medical or Psychiatric Inmates as set forth in Section 6.5, the County will provide notice to the City by phone or electronic mail. Such notification will be made to the person designated in Section 13.10 of this Agreement. At the time this notification is made the County may request that the City take custody of a sufficient number of its Medical or Psychiatric Inmates to reduce the number of Medical or Psychiatric Inmates to the capacity limits detailed in Section 6.5, or the County may inform the City that it is willing to continue to house these Inmates.

 6.7 County requests under Section 6.6 will be made as follows. The billable city (under this Agreement or other jail service agreements between the County and cities that have identical provisions as this Section) with the Inmate most recently admitted as Medical or Psychiatric Inmate will be asked to take custody of that inmate. This process will be repeated until such time as the Medical and Psychiatric populations are reduced below capacity limits, or the Jail is willing to house these Inmates.

 6.8 If the County, pursuant to Sections 6.6 and 6.7, requests that the City take custody of Medical or Psychiatric Inmates, the City shall comply with the County's request. The City may take custody of its [1]  Medical or Psychiatric Inmates by picking them up within 24-hours of the County's request, or by providing notice to the County, within 24-hours of the County's request, that the City would like the County to deliver the Inmates to the City's designated drop-off location or a backup location previously provided to the County  [2] . If the City has not picked-up the Medical or Psychiatric Inmate within 24-hours of the County's request, or the City has requested that the County take the Medical or Psychiatric Inmate to the designated drop-off location or backup location, the County will deliver the Medical or Psychiatric Inmate to the City's designated drop-off location or backup location. In either case, the City's designated drop-off location or backup location must accept delivery from the County, and must be available to do so seven days a week, twenty-four hours a day. In all cases, the County shall provide the receiving entity with Continuity of Care Records, in a sealed envelope, at the time custody is

 transferred. The City will ensure that the City and the receiving entity comply with all applicable confidentiality laws and rules. Similarly, the City will ensure that Continuity of Care Records are provided to the County at the time custody of a City Inmate receiving the level of care consistent with a Medical or Psychiatric Inmate is transferred to the County.

 6.9 The County will transport Medical or Psychiatric Inmates to a designated drop-off location or backup location within King County, Washington without charge. The City will pay all transportation costs for Medical or Psychiatric Inmates taken to a designated drop off location or backup location outside of King County, Washington. In no case will the County be obligated to transport a Medical or Psychiatric Inmate out-of- state.

 7.  Jail Planning and Possible Jail Expansion .

 7.1  Jail Planning . The County and the City will share information with the City and other cities that contract with the County for jail services regarding their respective Inmate populations and the need for Secure Detention and alternative means of detention. Specifically, each Party will annually share the latest forecasts for its Inmate populations and all current or planned contracting arrangements to house these Inmates. Taking this information into account, the County will estimate annually when the total forecasted use of the County's Secure Detention facilities will exceed the capacity of such facilities. If the number of years until capacity is exceeded is equal to or less than six (6) years, the County and City agree to explore ways to manage their respective Inmate populations through utilization of alternatives, system improvements and efficient use of existing Jail capacity.

 If at any time, the County determines it advisable to proceed with a project to increase its Secure Detention bed capacity, the County will initiate at its own expense the Pre-design Work for such project, the scope of which may include the option of adding housing units at the Maleng Regional JusticeCenter or other locations. Pre-design Work includes the environmental review process, capital plan preparation, studies and analysis required to meet applicable zoning and land use planning requirements, and a pre-design report for a preferred option if deemed appropriate by the County, all as directly associated with the proposed expansion of Jail Secure Detention capacity and the operation thereof. If expansion occurs, the cost of Pre-design Work will be included in the Total Jail Bed Expansion Capital Cost financed and used to calculate the City's Jail Bed Expansion Surcharge.

 7.2  Jail Bed Expansion Project Notification. The County shall provide Notification to the City in writing if the process in Section 7.1 results in a determination by the County that a Jail Bed Expansion Project will occur. This Notification, referred to as the Notification of Intent to Proceed with Jail Bed Expansion Project, shall include an estimate of: the scope of the project; the Total Jail Expansion Capital Cost; total project capital cost if different from the Total Jail Expansion Capital Cost; financing options under consideration by the County; the timeline for completing construction, including the date that the expansion is expected to become operational and when the County's debt service payments on the long-term debt to finance the project are expected to begin. The Notification of Intent to Proceed with Jail Expansion Project shall be an estimate and is not binding on the County. The Notification of Intent to Proceed with Jail Bed Expansion Project shall be issued at least one (1) year prior to the first day on which the County estimates the City would become responsible for payment of a Jail Bed Expansion Surcharge per Exhibit III, Section 5. The County will provide Notification to the City of the final calculation of the Jail Bed Expansion Surcharge amount not less than 45 days before the first Jail Bed Expansion Surcharge is payable, together with the Schedule of Jail Bed Expansion Surcharge Payments. The County's issuance of a Notification of Intent to Proceed with Jail Bed Expansion Project does not constitute a decision to proceed with construction: any such decision would only occur after any applicable environmental and planning requirements are completed. Additionally, the County may in its sole discretion determine not to pursue a Jail Bed Expansion Project, in which case no Jail Bed Expansion Surcharge, nor any portion of the Pre-design work, will be payable by the City.

 7.3  Payment of Jail Bed Expansion Surcharge . The City will be charged a monthly Jail Bed Expansion Surcharge, calculated per Exhibit III, Section 5. The Jail Bed Expansion Surcharge will be payable from and after the month that the County begins repayment of the long-term debt issued to fund the Jail Bed Expansion, or when the Jail Bed Expansion becomes operational, whichever is first, and will be payable in monthly amounts through the end of the term of the Agreement or the last payment date in the Schedule of Jail Bed Expansion Surcharge Payments, whichever comes first. The County will include the Jail Bed Expansion Surcharge in its monthly bill to the City issued per Section 5 of this Agreement. The Jail Bed Expansion Surcharge shall be due within such time and subject to such withholding and dispute resolution procedures as otherwise provided in Section 5 of this Agreement. The City's payment of the Jail Bed Expansion Surcharge does not provide any rights to the City to access jail beds after the expiration of the Agreement nor grant any ownership or management rights in the expanded facility or other County Jail facilities. The City has no obligation to pay the Jail Bed Expansion Surcharge after expiration of the Agreement; provided, however, that if the Parties negotiate an extension to the Agreement beyond 2030, they agree to negotiate in good faith for continuing the City's Jail Bed Expansion Surcharge as contemplated in the Schedule of Jail Bed Expansion Surcharge Payments as originally issued.

 7.4 This Agreement and the calculation of the Jail Bed Expansion Surcharge assumes that the proceeds of any County voter-approved financing to support the costs of the expansion of County Jail facilities will be applied to support costs associated with the County's regional and unincorporated area jail responsibilities (including specifically the County's responsibilities for felony and unincorporated misdemeanant offender populations) and that such voter-approved funds will not offset any city's local jail service or facility costs (including specifically the costs to the City owing under this Agreement, or the costs owed by any other city for inmates that are the responsibility of such city); provided however, that if other cities are directly provided any financial or other local benefit from such voter approved financing, then the City and County agree to negotiate in good faith adjustments to the Jail Bed Expansion Surcharge. The County and City agree it would not be appropriate for some cities to have access to the benefits, financial or otherwise, from a Secure Detention Jail bed expansion funded by a regional levy while others pay a surcharge or do not have access to these same benefits.

 8.  Indemnification .

 8.1 The County shall indemnify and hold harmless the City and its officers, agents, and employees, or any of them, from any and all claims, actions, suits, liability, loss, costs, expenses, and damages of any nature whatsoever, by reason of or arising out of any negligent action or omission of the County, its officers, agents, and employees, or any of them. In the event that any suit based upon such a claim, action, loss, or damage is brought against the City, the County shall defend the same at its sole cost and expense; provided, that, the City retains the right to participate in said suit if any principle of governmental or public law is involved; and if final judgment be rendered against the City and its officers, agents, and employees, or any of them, or jointly against the City and the County and their respective officers, agents, and employees, or any of them, the County shall satisfy the same.

 8.2 The City shall indemnify and hold harmless the County and its officers, agents, and employees, or any of them, from any and all claims, actions, suits, liability, loss, costs, expenses, and damages of any nature whatsoever, by reason of or arising out of any negligent act or omission of the City, its officers, agents, and employees, or any of them. In the event that any suit based upon such a claim, action, loss, or damage is brought against the County, the City shall defend the same at its sole cost and expense; provided that the County retains the right to participate in said suit if any principle of governmental or public laws is involved; and if final judgment be rendered against the County, and its officers, agents, and employees, or any of them, or jointly against the County and the City and their respective officers, agents, and employees, or any of them, the City shall satisfy the same.

 8.3 In executing this agreement, the County does not assume liability or responsibility for or in any way release the City from any liability or responsibility, which arises in whole or in part from the existence or effect of City ordinances, rules or regulations. If any cause, claim, suit, action or administrative proceeding is commenced in which the enforceability and/or validity of any such City ordinance, rule or regulation is at issue, the City shall defend the same at its sole expense and if judgment is entered or damages are awarded against the City, the County, or both, the City shall satisfy the same, including all chargeable costs and attorney's fees.

 8.4 The terms of this Section 8 "Indemnification" shall survive the termination or expiration of this Agreement.

 9.  Most Favored Treatment .

 9.1 During the term of this Agreement, the County represents and assures the City that no other city or town will be offered a contract covering the Jail, WER or jail services that grants such city or town Favored Treatment (as defined below), unless such contract, in substantially similar form, is also offered through Notification, by the King County Executive to the City.

 9.2 Within 60-days of receipt of an offer that the County represents as being made in accordance with Section 9.1, the City through Notification by its Mayor must either:

 i) Accept the offer and such acceptance means the City acknowledges that the County has complied with Section 9.1;

 ii) Decline the offer; or

 iii) Inform the County that the City believes the offer does not comply with the requirements of Section 9.1 at which point the matter will be deemed referred to JAG pursuant to Section 10 and thereafter either party may pursue dispute resolution per Section 11 of this Agreement.

 If the City within 60-days declines the offer per Section 9.2 (ii), or fails to respond within 60-days in the manner described in Section 9.2 (i), (ii) or (iii), then the City shall be deemed to have waived its right to enforce this Section with respect to the offer.

 9.3 Per Section 13.11 of this Agreement, final execution of any new or amended contract is subject to City Council and County Council approvals.

 9.4 Favored Treatment means that the terms contained in such other contract are clearly preferable to the terms contained in this Agreement, taking into account all provisions, including but not limited to, rates, guaranteed bed capacity, and minimum payment obligations.

 9.5 This Section shall not apply to a) temporary service contracts of twelve months or less in duration; provided that such temporary service contracts shall not cause the City to pay more in Maintenance Charges and booking fees than the City would have paid without such a temporary service contract; b) reciprocal bed use agreements; and c) any agreements among the County and any city or town for additional services not provided for in this Agreement.

 9.6 Notwithstanding anything in this section to the contrary, the Parties acknowledge that a city with a significantly smaller inmate population is subject to proportionally much greater variability in its number of inmates than is the City of Seattle, and therefore, the parties agree that this Section 9 shall not be triggered if the County enters into an agreement substantially similar to this Agreement, except that:

 (A) If the signatory city has an average annual daily population of City Detainees of 10 or less, such agreement need not incorporate a Secure Bed Floor or Minimum Bed Adjustment Charge, as the signatory city and County may agree.

 (B) If the signatory city has an average annual daily population of City Detainees of greater than 10 and less than30, and the Secure Bed Cap is between 30% and 50% higher than the Secure Bed Floor for each corresponding year, (and the Secure Bed Cap and Floor and minimum Secure Bed Floor may be expressed in fractions rather than whole integers), as the signatory city and County may agree.

 10.  Jail Agreement Administration Group (JAG) . A JAG is hereby established to work together to assure the effective implementation of this Agreement and resolve any Agreement administration, implementation or interpretation issues including, without limitation, issues related to Inmate transportation, alternative and community correction programs, coordination with the courts and law enforcement, mental health, drug and alcohol treatment, Agreement interpretation, any capital expenditure charge or budget included in the Maintenance Charge or WER Charge, referrals of disputes (including but not limited to disputes arising under Section 5) and issues related to the expedient transfer of City Inmates into or out of alternative facilities within or outside of King County. The JAG shall be composed of two City representatives and two County representatives (including a representative of the Executive and the Director of DAJD), as follows:

 County Executive Representative (1)

 City of Seattle Representative (2)

 Director of the Department of Adult and Juvenile Detention (1)

 The City of Seattle representatives will be appointed by the Mayor of Seattle. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if additional cities execute an agreement substantially similar to this Agreement, then each such additional city shall be entitled to appoint a representative to the JAG.

 The cities other than Seattle that are party to such substantially similar agreements will determine who their representatives are to the JAG.

 The Parties agree that the JAG has no authority to make a final decision with regard to any matter related to the Agreement. If the City, or the County, is not satisfied with status of a matter after discussion in the JAG, that party retains all rights to seek further legal redress as provided for the Agreement, including referral of matters to dispute resolution per Section 11 of the Agreement. The JAG may meet in concert with other similar jail advisory groups created under other jail service agreements between the County and other cities.

 11.  Dispute Resolution . In the event the Parties are unable to resolve a dispute within 30 days of its referral to the JAG per Section 5 or Section 10, then either Party may pursue the dispute resolution provisions of this Section 11.

 11.1 Either Party may give Notification to the other in writing of a dispute involving the interpretation or execution of the Agreement. Within thirty (30) days of this Notification, the King County Executive and the Mayor of the City shall meet to resolve the dispute. If the dispute is not resolved, then at the request of either Party it shall be referred to non-binding mediation. Except as provided in Section 11.2, the mediator will be selected in the following manner: the City shall propose a mediator and the County shall propose a mediator; in the event the mediators are not the same person, the two proposed mediators shall select a third mediator who shall mediate the dispute. Alternately, the Parties may agree to select a mediator through a mediation service mutually acceptable to both Parties. The Parties shall share equally in the costs charged by the mediator or mediation service.

 11.2 If other cities are party to an agreement substantially similar to this Agreement, each such city shall be promptly sent Notification of the dispute and, any such city shall be given the opportunity to both participate in the initial meeting to resolve the dispute and to participate as a party in mediation of such dispute. In the case of more than two cities participating in a mediation, the parties agree to engage a mediator through a mediator or mediation service acceptable to both KingCounty and a majority of cities participating in the mediation. The County and all cities joining the mediation shall share equally in the costs thereof per Section 11.1. Each party reserves the right to litigate any disputed issue in court, de novo.

 12.  Termination . This Agreement can only be terminated by mutual agreement of the Parties or due to the material breach of a party.

 12.1  Forty Five-Day Notification of Intent to Terminate . Any Party wishing to terminate this Agreement on grounds of a material breach of the other Party shall issue a written Notification of intent to terminate, which Notification shall clearly set forth the grounds for alleging a material breach, not less than forty-five (45) days prior to issuing a ninety (90) day termination Notification under Section 12.2 of this Agreement. Upon receipt of the written Notification of intent to terminate, the Parties will meet to confer on whether there are steps that the non-terminating Party can take in order to avoid a ninety (90) day termination Notification under Section 12.2 of this Agreement. The Parties agree within such forty- five (45) day period to make a good faith effort to resolve any alleged materials breach through the dispute resolution provisions in Section 11 of this Agreement.

 12.2  Ninety-Day Termination Notification . After the forty-five (45) day period has run under Section 12.1 of this Agreement, if the Party that issued the Notification of intent to terminate still desires to terminate this Agreement, said Party shall provide the other Party ninety (90) days written termination Notification, as provided in RCW 70.48.090.

 13.  General Provisions.

 13.1  Other Facilities . This Agreement reserves in each party the power to establish a temporary holding facility during a riot, civil disobedience or natural disaster, to establish group homes or other care or rehabilitation facilities in furtherance of a social service program, to temporarily transfer Inmates to alternative detention facilities in order to respond to Jail overcrowding, and to comply with a final order of a federal court or a state court of record for the care and treatment of Inmates.

 13.2  Grants . Both Parties shall cooperate and assist each other toward procuring grants or financial assistance from the United States, the State of Washington, and private benefactors for the Jail, the care and rehabilitation of Inmates, and the reduction of costs of operating and maintaining Jail facilities.

 13.3  Severability.  If any provision of this Agreement shall be held invalid, the remainder of this Agreement shall not be affected thereby.

 13.4  Remedies.  No waiver of any right under this Agreement shall be effective unless made in writing by the authorized representative of the party to be bound thereby. Failure to insist upon full performance of any one or several occasions does not constitute consent to or waiver of any later non-performance nor does payment of a billing or continued performance after Notification of a deficiency in performance constitute an acquiescence thereto. The Parties are entitled to all remedies in law or equity.

 EXHIBIT I

 Method of Determining Billable Charge and Agency

 Process Overview

 The application of all billing rules in conjunction with Section 1.7 of this Agreement comprises the method for determining the principal basis for booking or confining a person. The County's billing system examines all open and active charges and holds for each calendar day and applies the Billing Priority Rules and Tie Breaker Rules as set forth below. Then the charge billable agency is determined from the billable charge(s) or hold(s) and the application of exception rules, for example, the special DUI sentencing rule or the special six hour rule.

 Billing Priority Rules

 The Billing Priority Group is determined in the following order:

 Tie Breaker Rules

 Tie breaker rules are applied in the following order to the Local Misdemeanor Priority Group (Number 4 under Billing Priority Rules) when there are charges with multiple charge billable agencies. The first rule that applies determines the billable charge(s). The charge billable agency for the selected charge(s) is the billable agency.

 Attachment I-1: City Jail Charges Clarification

 This document contains several examples consistent with Section 1.7 of this Agreement.

 Attachment I-2

 Inmate Transfers: Transfer Request Exemption Criteria, Notice and Billing

 (Relating to Section 1.7.9)

 A. In the event of one or more of the following transfer exception criteriaare met, a transfer may be denied by the County, in which case the person for whom the City has sought a transfer remains a City Inmate:

 (1) Inmate has medical/health conditions/ treatments preventing transfer.

 (2) Transfer location refuses Inmate.

 (3) Inmate refuses to be transported and poses a security risk.

 (4) Inmate misses transport due to being at court or other location.

 (5) City refuses to sign transfer paperwork requiring the City to arrange transportation for Inmate back to KingCounty, if needed, when City sentence ends.

 B. If the County has refused a transfer request and thereafter determines that it no longer needs to detain the person and the person would as a result become a City Inmate, then the County will provide notice to the City that it will become billable for the Inmate. The City will not incur a Maintenance Charge on the day of notice. If the City transfers the Inmate during the six calendar days immediately following the day of notice, it will not incur a Maintenance Charge for the first calendar day following notice, but will incur a Maintenance Charge for each subsequent calendar day until the Inmate is transferred. If the City does not transfer the Inmate from the Jail during this six day period, the City is billable beginning the calendar day following the day of notice from the County.

 C. The terms of this Attachment I-2 may be amended by administrative agreement evidenced by execution in writing by the Mayor of the City of Seattle and King County Executive.

 EXHIBIT II

 Exception to Billing Procedure

 For persons serving the one and two day commitments pursuant to the mandatory DUI sentence grid who report directly from the community to the Jail for incarceration, Inmate day shall not be defined according to Section 1.17 of the Agreement. Instead, Inmate day shall be defined as a twenty-four hour period beginning at the time of booking. Any portion of a twenty-four hour period shall be counted as a full Inmate day. The number of days billed for each sentence shall not exceed the sentence lengths specified on the court commitment.

 Two examples are provided for illustration:

 Two-day sentence served on consecutive days:

 Two-day sentence served on non-consecutive days:

 The Department of Adult and Juvenile Detention will apply this definition of Inmate day to the City's direct DUI one and two- day Inmates by adjusting the City's monthly bill before it is sent to the City. If the changes are not made for some reason, the City will notify the Department of Adult and Juvenile Detention, which will make the necessary adjustments.

 EXHIBIT III

 Calculation of Fees, Charges and Surcharges

 The City shall pay the fees, charges, surcharges and Offsite Medical Charges with such annual adjustments for inflation and other re-sets as described below.

 1.  MAINTENANCE CHARGE, WER CHARGE AND CAPITAL EXPENDITURE CHARGE

 The Maintenance Charge and WER Charge shall be calculated as shown in Attachment III-1 and as described below.

 a. The Maintenance Charge starting January 1, 2012, and for the remainder of the calendar year 2012, excluding any adjustments for Capital Expenditure Charges, will be $120.96. When combined with the Capital Expenditure Charges, the Maintenance Charge for calendar year 2012 is $125.00. The Maintenance Charge shall be annually adjusted as described in Section 7 below and shall be annually inflated and/or re-set as described in Section 7 below. The Maintenance Charge calculation shall include 28.69% of the total DAJD Budgeted Jail Costs associated with booking; this percentage of booking costs to be included in the Maintenance Charge shall remain fixed through the term of this Agreement.

 i. The City will not be charged a Maintenance Charge for a City Inmate where the Inmate has been offsite (e.g. housed outside of the Jail) for all 24 hours of a Surcharge Day and subject to 1:1 Guarding Surcharge for the entirety of such 24 hour period.

 b. WER Charge. In lieu of the Maintenance Charge, the City will be charged a WER Charge for each Inmate Day in which a City WER Participant is in the WER program. Starting January 1, 2012, and for the remainder of the calendar year 2012, excluding any adjustments for Capital Expenditure Charges, the WER Charge will be $88.10. When combined with Capital Expenditure Charges, the WER Charge for calendar year 2012 is $92.14. The WER Charge shall be annually adjusted as described in Section 5 below and shall be annually inflated and/or re- set as described in Section 7 below.

 c. In addition to the annual adjustments to the Maintenance Charge and WER Charge described above, KingCounty will increase the Maintenance Charge and WER Charge to capture the cost of Capital Expenditures. Capital Expenditures are defined as the cost of repairing and renovating current jail capacity and support and administrative facilities that benefit Jail or WER operations. Capital Expenditures include, but shall not be limited to, the Integrated Security Project (ISP) and the Courthouse Seismic Stabilization Project (CSSP). Additional Capital Expenditures will be included in the Maintenance Charge and WER Charge if such expenditures benefit City Inmates or City WER Participants. Any Capital Expenditure that solely benefits CountyInmates will not be charged to the City. Capital Expenditures do not include Jail Bed Expansion Projects. Capital Expenditures do not include Major Maintenance as defined in Attachment III-1.

 i. Capital Expenditures will be calculated in proportion to the square footage that benefits adult detention. Cities will be billed their proportionate share based on the total number of Inmate Days (as defined in Section 1.17). By August 15 of each year, DAJD will estimate the total number of Inmate Days for the following calendar year and provide notice to the City of the Capital Expenditure Charge to be included in the Maintenance Charge and WER Charge in the following calendar year.

 ii. Upon request of the City, the County shall provide its 6- year CIP and its 6-year major maintenance plan to the City. The County will provide a detailed line item budget of each Capital Expenditure. If the City disputes that the Capital Expenditure benefits City Inmates or otherwise disputes the inclusion of the Capital Expenditure or any portion of the Capital Expenditures' budget in the maintenance fee, the matter will be referred to the JAG as described in Section 5 of this Agreement. Capital Expenditures will not be charged to the City to the extent such Capital Expenditures are covered by federal grants, state grants, insurance proceeds, capital maintenance reserves or voter approved capital funding for jail related improvements.

 iii. Capital Expenditures, if debt financed, shall begin being charged when debt service payments begin for the permanent financing of the Capital Expenditure and shall continue until the end of the debt amortization unless the debt amortization is less than fifteen (15) years, in which case the charges to the City will be amortized over fifteen (15) years. If the Capital Expenditure is not debt financed, Capital Expenditure charges shall be based on actual expenditures. The County will make available documentation evidencing such expenditures.

 iv. Beginning January 1, 2012 and continuing through calendar year 2012, the Capital Expenditure Charge for ISP for the City is $3.36 and the Capital Expenditure Charge for the CSSP is $0.68, for a combined total Capital Expenditure Charge of $4.04 to be added to the Maintenance Charge and WER Charge amounts set forth in subparagraphs a and b above.

 2.  BOOKING FEE

 a. The Booking Fee shall be based on the City continuing to not use the County's Personal Recognizance (PR) screeners. The Booking Fee starting January 1, 2012 and for the remainder of the calendar year 2012 will be $95.00, as illustrated in Attachment III-1. The Booking Fee shall be calculated as shown in Attachment III. The Booking Fee shall include 25.88% of the total DAJD Budgeted Jail Costs associated with booking; this percentage of booking costs to be included in the Booking Fee shall remain fixed through the term of this Agreement.

 b. In the event the City municipal court order providing for City PR screeners is revoked or expires, and the City desires to have the County provide PR screeners, the City will provide 1-year advance Notification to the County, and the Parties will enter into good faith negotiations to develop a revised booking fee that will reflect the County's reasonable costs, determined in a manner generally consistent with the rate model for calculating the Booking Fee, to provide this additional service to the City. The revised booking fee must be adopted by amendment to this Agreement approved by the Parties' respective Councils. Until and unless the Parties agree upon a revised booking fee, the County shall be under no obligation to provide PR screener services and may require the City secure such service through alternate means as a pre- requisite to housing City Inmates or serving City WER Participants.

 3.  SURCHARGES

 In addition to payment of the Maintenance Charge or WER Charge and the Booking Fee, the City shall pay Surcharges associated with services provided to City Inmates as described below. The types of services provided to an Inmate associated with each Surcharge, and a general description of each Surcharge, is set forth in Attachment III-2.

 The initial Surcharge amounts described in paragraphs (a) - (d) below shall apply from the January 1, 2012 through December 31, 2012 and shall thereafter be annually adjusted as described in Section 7 below.

 a. Infirmary Care. For Medical Inmates, the City shall pay an Infirmary Care Surcharge of $193.87 for each Surcharge Day.

 b. Non-Acute Psychiatric Care. For Non-Acute Psychiatric Inmates, the City shall pay a Psychiatric Care Surcharge of $61.00 for each Surcharge Day.

 c. Acute Psychiatric Care. For Acute Psychiatric Inmates, the City shall pay an Acute Psychiatric Care Surcharge of $231.11 (which is the sum of the Psychiatric Care Surcharge plus the Acute Psychiatric Housing Surcharge) for each Surcharge Day.

 i. The Acute Psychiatric Housing Surcharge for each Surcharge Day shall be $170.11.

 ii. The Psychiatric Care Surcharge for each Surcharge Day of $61.00 is added to the Acute Psychiatric Housing surcharge for a total Acute Psychiatric Care Surcharge of $231.11.

 d. 1:1 Guarding Surcharge. The 1:1 Guarding Surcharge is the charge imposed when the County dedicates an individual officer to guard a City Inmate. The Surcharge shall be $57.67 per guard for each hour or portion thereof, and as further described in Attachment III-2.

 e. A Surcharge Day is defined as a 24-hour period from midnight to midnight, or any portion thereof, in which an Inmate receives any of the services within the Surcharges listed in subparagraphs (a) - (c) above; provided that with respect to the Infirmary Care Surcharge, Psychiatric Care Surcharge and Acute Psychiatric Surcharge, a maximum of one (1) charge may be imposed within the 24-hour period for a single inmate, and the charge imposed shall be the highest applicable charge. For example, if an inmate is placed in Acute Psychiatric Care, released to the general population, and then again placed in Acute Psychiatric Care all within the same 24-hour period (midnight to midnight), a single Acute Psychiatric Care Surcharge will be imposed. Similarly, if an Inmate is placed in Acute Psychiatric Care and then in Non- Acute Psychiatric Care within the 24-hour midnight to midnight period, then a single Acute Psychiatric Care charge will be imposed.

 4.  OFFSITE MEDICAL CARE CHARGES

 In addition to the Maintenance Charge or WER Charge, the Booking Fee, and the Surcharges detailed above, the City shall be responsible for payment of all Offsite Medical Care Charges incurred by a City Inmate.

 5.  JAIL BED EXPANSION SURCHARGE

 The City shall pay a monthly Jail Bed Expansion Surcharge from and after the date the Jail Bed Expansion Project becomes operational or the month the County begins repayment of long- term debt associated with borrowing to fund the Jail Bed Expansion Project (thus excluding any short-term debt issued in anticipation of paying off such short term debt with long- term debt financing), whichever is first. The Jail Bed Expansion Surcharge is intended to be fixed over time and shall be calculated in accordance with this Section and as shown in the hypothetical calculation in Attachment III-1. The Jail Bed Expansion Surcharge will equal one-twelfth (1/12) of the Annual Debt Service Proxy Amount multiplied by the City's Percentage of Bed Use, where:

 Annual Debt Service Proxy Amount is the equalized annual cost of both principal and interest necessary to repay the Total Jail Expansion Capital Cost (not to exceed the Capital Cost Cap defined below) over the borrowing term (number of years) for the County's long-term debt associated with the Jail Bed Expansion Project, provided that if the County issues such long-term debt with a shorter repayment term than twenty (20) years, the Annual Debt Service Proxy Amount shall be calculated based on a 20-year repayment term by dividing the cumulative principal and interest payable by the County under its debt financing by a 20-year repayment term; and

 City's Percentage of Bed Use is determined by dividing the City's Average Daily Population of City Inmates in Secure Detention in Jail for the three (3) calendar years prior to the opening of the Jail Bed Expansion Project by the Average Daily Population of County Inmates in Secure Detention in County facilities for such period.

 The County shall prepare a Schedule of Jail Bed Expansion Surcharge Payments based on this formula and shall provide Notification of it to the City not less than forty-five (45) days in advance of the first Jail Bed Expansion Surcharge being due. The Schedule shall present the full repayment schedule (covering 20 years or, if longer, the actual debt repayment term) of the Total Jail Expansion Capital Cost, notwithstanding that the Agreement may terminate prior to the end of scheduled payments.

 The Total Jail Expansion Capital Cost used to calculate the Jail Bed Expansion Surcharge shall not exceed the Capital Cost Cap. The Capital Cost Cap is $66 million in 2011 dollars adjusted to the year that construction begins on the Jail Bed Expansion Project, using the "Means Construction Cost Index" for the Seattle area or some other generally accepted construction cost inflation index for the Seattle area.

 6.  MINIMUM BED ADJUSTMENT CHARGE

 A Minimum Bed Adjustment Charge will be payable periodically by the City in accordance with this Section and as calculated per the hypothetical example in Attachment III-1.

 a. Each July and January, beginning July 2012, County will confirm whether, based on the City's filed Certification(s) of Secure Housing Usage, the City has housed in Jail the entirety of City Pre-Trial Detainees requiring Secure Detention over the entire preceding six (6) months, and (for confirmation each January, beginning January 2013) the preceding calendar year. City Detainees on Work Release or in other Community Corrections Programs, whether or not such programs are operated by the County, shall not be considered City Detainees requiring Secure Detention for purposes this Certification.

 b. The County will then determine the average daily number of City Inmates in Jail in the calculation period (the preceding six months and/or preceding calendar year, depending on whether the calculation is made in July or January) and compare that number to the Secure Bed Floor number for the corresponding year in Column 4 of Attachment III-3. If the average daily number of City Inmates in Secure Detention in Jail in the calculation period is less than the Secure Bed Floor number, the City will be charged a Minimum Bed Adjustment Charge.

 c.  Minimum Bed Adjustment Charge Formula . The Minimum Bed Adjustment Charge will equal, for the calculation period (the preceding six months or calendar year as applicable per Subsections 6.c.i and 6.c.ii below), the difference between the cumulative daily Maintenance Charges as applied to the Secure Bed Floor for the corresponding calendar year in Column 4 of Attachment III-3 and the actual cumulative daily Maintenance Charges for the City's Inmates for the calculation period. WER charges paid by the City shall be excluded from the calculation of the Minimum Bed Adjustment Charge.

 i.  All Pre-Trial Detainees Not Housed in Jail: Six Month Charge Calculation and Billing . If, upon review each July and January, of City Certification(s) of Secure Housing Usage, the County confirms that all of the City's Pre-Trial Detainees requiring Secure Detention were NOT housed within Jail in the preceding six months, the County shall calculate whether a Minimum Bed Adjustment Charge is owed by applying the calculation formula using the preceding six months of billable City Inmate Maintenance Charges, (January through June, or July through December).

 ii.  All Pre-Trial Detainees Housed in Jail: Yearly Charge Calculation and Billing . If, upon review each January of the City's Certifications of Secure Housing Usage, the County confirms that all Pre-Trial Detainees requiring Secure Detention were housed in Jail for the entire preceding calendar year, then the County shall calculate whether a Minimum Bed Adjustment Charge is owed by the applying the calculation formula using the preceding calendar year of City Inmate Maintenance Charges.

 d.  Notice and Billing . No later than each August 1 and February 1, the County will transmit a bill to the City for any Minimum Bed Adjustment Charge owed for the preceding six months and/or calendar year as appropriate. If no amount is owed, the County will by such date transmit a notice to the City confirming same. Within forty-five (45) days after receipt of a bill for a Minimum Bed Adjustment Charge, the City shall pay the full amount billed or withhold a portion thereof and provide the County written notice (meeting the requirements of Section 5.2.1) specifying the total amount withheld and the grounds for withholding such amount, together with payment of the remainder of the amount billed (if any amount remains). Withholding of any Minimum Bed Adjustment amount billed or alleging that any Party is in violation of any provision of this Agreement shall be subject to the terms of Section 5 of the Agreement regarding withholding of disputed payments and subject to the dispute resolution procedures in Section 5 of the Agreement.

 7.  INFLATORS AND RE-SETS OF FEES AND CHARGES

 a.  Inflators . All fees and charges, excluding: (1) Offsite Medical Care Charges; (2) the Capital Expenditure Charge components of the Maintenance Charge and WER Charge; and (3) the Jail Bed Expansion Charge, shall be annually inflated by the percentage rates described below, effective January 1 of each calendar year starting January 1, 2013, in order to determine the final rates and charges for said calendar year, subject further to re-set of the underlying "base rates" periodically as described in Subsection 7.e below.

 Non-Medical Charges : the following fees and charges are subject to an annual inflator of the Seattle-Tacoma-Bremerton CPI-W (covering the 12-month period ending in June) plus 1.5%, but shall in no event be lower than 1.5%.:

 i. Maintenance Charge

 ii. WER Charge

 iii. Booking Fee

 iv. Acute Psychiatric Housing Surcharge

 v. 1:1 Guarding

 Medical Charges : the following fees and charges are subject to an annual inflator of the Seattle-Tacoma-Bremerton CPI-W (covering the 12-month period ending in June) plus 3%, but shall in no event be lower than 3%:

 i. Infirmary Care Surcharge

 ii. Psychiatric Care Surcharge

 b.  Final Fee and Charge Notice for Following Calendar Year . No later than August 15 of each year, the County will provide notice to the City of the final fees and charges listed in this Subsection 7.a for the following calendar year reflecting the application of the June-June CPI index in the manner prescribed in Subsection 7.a above.

 c.  Inflation Re-sets . Notwithstanding the terms of Subsections 7.a and 7.b to the contrary, in the event the Seattle-Tacoma-Bremerton CPI-W (June-June) exceeds 8% then, as part of the August 15 final fee and charge notice, the County will include information demonstrating whether, based on factors affecting the DAJD Budgeted Jail Costs including but not limited to personnel costs, food, utilities and pharmaceuticals, the County's reasonably expected inflation experience for the DAJD Budgeted Jail Costs in the next calendar year (the "Expected Inflation Rate") is less than or greater than said CPI-W (June-June) rate. If the Expected Inflation Rate is lower than the CPI-W (June-June) rate, the County will apply the lower of the two rates to the fees and charges listed in this Subsection 7.c for the following calendar year.

 d.  2012 Fees and Charges . Attachment III-1 shows the allocation of 2011 Budgeted Jail Costs used to derive the 2012 fees and charges, applying the inflators in Subsection 7.a above in order to calculate the fees and charges applicable in 2012 as set forth above in Sections 1, 2, 3 and 4.

 e.  Five-Year Base Re-sets for Fees and Charges . Every five years, the base costs on which fees and charges are based will be updated, by applying the previous year's Budgeted Jail Costs to the allocation methodology as illustrated in Attachment III-1. Thus, fees and charges in 2017 will be determined using the model in Attachment III-1 incorporating 2016 Budgeted Jail Costs, and then applying the annual inflators per Subsection 7.a. Similar re-sets shall occur in 2022 and 2027 (together with 2012 and 2017, these years are collectively referred to as the "Base Years"). By March 1 of the calendar year before each Base Year, the County will provide the City written notice including a detailed calculation of the re-set fees and charges for the next occurring Base Year (excluding application of inflators, which will be provided by August 15 per Subsection 7.b above). The Parties shall promptly thereafter meet to review the information and will work in good faith to resolve any questions or issues by May 1 of such year. In the event that the County implements a new accounting system that makes it impracticable to generate the same cost allocations shown in the cost model illustrated in Attachment III-1, the Parties agree that technical adjustments may be made to the rate model in order to recreate as nearly as practicable the original rate model.

 By way of illustration and without limitation:

 ? Year 2013 fees and charges are determined by applying the inflators to 2012 fees and charges per Subsection 7.a.

 ? Year 2014 fees and charges are determined by applying the inflators to 2013 fees and charges per Subsection o WER.

The County shall accept City Inmates for confinement in the Jail and City WER Participants for assignment to WER, except as provided in Sections 5.4, and 6 of this Agreement. The County shall also furnish the City with Jail facilities, booking, transportation among County facilities, as determined necessary in the County's sole discretion, including the various Jail facilities, HarborviewMedicalCenter and WesternStateHospital, and custodial services, and personnel for the confinement of City Inmates at least equal to those the County provides for confinement of CountyInmates. However, the County reserves the right to operate specific programs and/or facilities exclusively for CountyInmates or persons sentenced or assigned to Community Corrections Programs. The County shall furnish to City Inmates in Secure Detention all Jail medical, dental and other health care services required to be provided pursuant to federal or state law. Also, the County shall make every reasonable effort to release a City Inmate or City WER Participant as expeditiously as possible after the County has received notice of a court order to release. Nothing in this section shall be deemed to limit the County's right to refuse to accept City Detainees for confinement in Jail or sentencing to WER when they are deemed by the County to be in need of urgent medical care.

 3.1 Upon the execution of this Agreement, the City will provide the County with a completed "Certification of Secure Housing Use," (or "Certification") using the form appended hereto as Exhibit IV and submitting it to the person specified in Section 13.10 of this Agreement. The City will thereafter provide the County with updated Certification forms as necessary to provide the County prompt notice of any changes in the status of its housing use by City Detainees, or to provide notice to the County about City Detainee status after the expiration of the time period covered by the prior Certification.

 To the extent practicable, the City will provide Certifications updating the status of City Detainees in advance of any changes in City Detainee status. In the event the County has not received an updated Certification with new information as of any July 15 or January 15, the County shall be entitled to rely on the most recently filed Certification for all purposes under this Agreement, including but not limited to the calculation of the Minimum Bed Adjustment Charge and likely Jail Secure Detention requirements of the City.

 4.  City Compensation . The City will pay the County a Booking Fee, Maintenance Charge, Minimum Bed Adjustment Charge, WER Charge, Surcharges and Offsite Medical Charges as follows (together with such other charges as may be applicable in accordance with this Agreement):

 4.1  Booking Fee . The Booking Fee shall be assessed for the booking of City Inmates by or on behalf of the City into Secure Detention in the Jail, and for the booking of City WER Participants directly reporting to WER, as further described in Exhibit III, Section 2. The Booking Fee will be annually adjusted effective each January 1st.

 4.2  Maintenance Charge . The Maintenance Charge shall be assessed for a City Inmate for each Inmate Day as provided in Exhibit III, Subsection 1.a. The Maintenance Charge will be annually adjusted effective each January 1st.

 4.2.1 The City agrees to pay for maintenance of City Inmates at a minimum level associated with the Secure Bed Floor in Attachment III-3. Accordingly, if the number of billable City Inmates falls below the prescribed level, the City will be assessed a Minimum Bed Adjustment Charge calculated and payable as described in Exhibit III, Section 6.

 4.2.2 The County will maintain its program to provide notice to the City after booking a City Inmate in order to give notice that the City Inmate has been booked and to provide the opportunity for release to the City if the City so desires. Such action will take place as soon as reasonably possible but no later than the next business day after booking. A City Inmate released within six hours of booking will result in no Maintenance Charges.

 4.2.3 The County will maintain its program to provide notice to the City of the billing status of its Inmates for the prior calendar day in cases where confinement is the result of multiple warrants or sentences from two or more jurisdictions. As of the date of this Agreement, this notice is provided to the City once each business day when applicable. The intent of this program is to allow the City to take custody of a City Inmate if it so desires after the other jurisdictional warrants are resolved and thereby prevent unnecessary Maintenance Charges.

 4.2.4 The Parties may amend the notice requirements of Sections 4.2.2 and 4.2.3 by administrative agreement signed by both the Mayor of the City of Seattle and the King County Executive.

 4.3  WER Charge . The WER Charge shall be assessed for a City WER Participant for each Inmate Day as provided in Exhibit III, Subsection 1.b. The WER charge will be annually adjusted effective each January 1st.

 4.3.1  Access to and Charges for City Inmate Use of Community Corrections Programs . The Parties agree to discuss in good faith the ability for the City to access Community Corrections Programs in addition to WER, and to negotiate charges for such access. Any agreement between the Parties with respect to access and charges for Community Corrections Programs in addition to WER shall be enacted through an amendment to this Agreement.

 4.4  Surcharges and Offsite Medical Charges . In addition to the Booking Fee, Maintenance Charge, Minimum Bed Adjustment Charge, WER Charge and any other charges agreed to per Section 4.3.1, the City will be charged for Offsite Medical Charges and Surcharges as detailed in Exhibit III, Section 3 and 4.

 4.4.1  Proposed Notice of Certain Surcharges . The County intends to provide or make available to the City timely notice of occurrences when a City Inmate is admitted to Harborview Medical Center or other offsite medical institution, or is receiving infirmary care or psychiatric care that will subject a City to Surcharges. Notice provided or made available will be based on information known to DAJD at the time (since billing status of an Inmate may be changed retroactively based on new information or other factors). The County intends to provide or make available this notice within 2 business days following the day in which the chargeable event occurs and will make good faith efforts to provide notice sooner if practicable. The County will make good faith efforts to try to institute a means to provide notice to the City within 24 hours of the admittance of a City Inmate to Harborview Medical Center or other offsite medical institution. The County's failure to provide or make available notice or develop quicker means to provide notice to the City as detailed above shall not excuse the City from financial responsibility for related Offsite Medical Charges or Surcharges, and shall not be a basis for imposing financial responsibility for related Offsite Medical Charges or Surcharges on the County.

 5.  Billing and Billing Dispute Resolution Procedures.

 5.1 The County shall transmit billings to the City monthly. Within forty-five (45) days after receipt, the City shall pay the full amount billed or withhold a portion thereof and provide the County written notice meeting the requirements of Section 5.2.1 specifying the total amount withheld and the grounds for withholding such amount, together with payment of the remainder of the amount billed (if any amount remains). Notwithstanding the foregoing, the County shall bill the City for Offsite Medical Charges as such charges are periodically received by the County from third party medical institutions or other offsite medical providers, and further, the County shall bill the Minimum Bed Payment Adjustment Charge per the terms of Exhibit III, Section 6. Offsite Medical Charges and Minimum Bed Payment Charges shall be due within such time and subject to such withholding and dispute resolution procedures as otherwise provided in this Section 5.

 5.2 Withholding of any amount billed or alleging a violation related to billing provisions of this Agreement shall constitute a dispute, which shall be resolved as follows:

 5.2.1 The County shall respond in writing to billing disputes within 60-days of receipt of such disputes by the DAJD billing offices. To ensure the soonest start to the 60-day timeline, the City should send billing disputes directly to the DAJD billing office by fax or U.S. mail, rather than to any other County office or officer. The DAJD billing office address as of the date of this Amendment is:

 KC DAJD

 Attn: Finance - Inmate Billing

 500 5th Avenue

 Seattle, WA98104 FAX Number: 206-296-0570

 5.2.2 Thereafter, the County and the City shall attempt to resolve the dispute by negotiation. If such negotiation is unsuccessful, either Party may refer the dispute to JAG for resolution. In the event JAG is unable to resolve the dispute within 30-days of referral, either Party may pursue the dispute resolution mechanisms outlined in Section 11.

 5.3 Any amount withheld from a billing, which is determined to be owed to the County pursuant to the dispute resolution procedure described herein, shall be paid by the City within thirty (30) days of the date of the negotiated resolution or appeal determination.

 5.4 If the City fails to pay a billing within 45-days of receipt, the County will provide the City with a notice of its failure to pay and the City shall have ten (10) days from receipt of such notice to cure non-payment. Any undisputed billing amount not paid by the City within sixty (60) days of receipt of the billing, and any amounts found to be owing to the County as a result of the billing dispute resolution procedure that are not paid within thirty (30) days of resolution, shall be conclusively established as a lawful debt owed to the County by the City, shall be binding on the Parties and shall not be subject to legal question either directly or collaterally. In the event the City fails to cure its nonpayment, the City shall be deemed to have voluntarily waived its right to house City Inmates in the Jail or be assigned to WER and, at the County's request, will remove City Inmates already housed in the Jail or assigned to WER within thirty (30) days. Thereafter, the County, at its sole discretion, may accept no further City Inmates or City WER Participants until all outstanding bills are paid. This provision shall not limit the City's ability to challenge or dispute any billings that have been paid by the City.

 5.5 The County may charge an interest rate equal to the interest rate on the monthly County investment earnings on any undisputed billing amount not paid by the City within forty- five (45) days of receipt of the billing, and any amounts found to be owing to the County as a result of the billing dispute resolution procedure.

 5.6 Each Party may examine the other's books and records to verify charges. If an examination reveals an improper charge, the next billing statement will be adjusted appropriately. Disputes on matters related to this Agreement which are revealed by an audit shall be resolved pursuant to Section 5.2.

 6.  Secure Beds for Seattle Inmates: Cap and Floor . The City may house City Inmates in Secure Detention within the Jail in an aggregate number, according to the Jail's Official Daily Population Count, equal to or less than the number shown in Column 3 "Secure Bed Cap" in Attachment III-3 in the corresponding calendar year, as further described in this Section.

 6.1 The County will provide notice to the City if the City has exceeded the Secure Bed Cap, by providing notice to the person or persons identified by the official Notification recipient designated in Section 13.10 of this Agreement (if other than the individual identified in Section 13.10). After the City has exceeded the Secure Bed Cap for four (4) consecutive days, the County may either decide to continue to house City Inmates in excess of the Secure Bed Cap or refuse to accept bookings from the City. Notwithstanding the terms of the preceding sentence, if at any time the County determines that housing City Inmates in number above the Secure Bed Cap jeopardizes its ability to operate its jail facilities in a safe and secure manner, the County may refuse bookings for City Detainees until such time as the number of City Inmates is reduced below the Secure Bed Cap.

 6.2  Adjustments to the Secure Bed Cap and Floor . The Secure Bed Cap and Floor may be increased or decreased effective January 1 of any calendar year in accordance with the terms and conditions of this Section.

 6.2.1  Decrease in Secure Bed Cap and FloorWhenCity Utilizing Secure Detention Facilities in Addition to Jail . If the City's Certification of Secure Housing Use (in form of Exhibit IV to this Agreement) confirms that the City is or will be housing City Detainees requiring Secure Detention in facilities in addition to Jail from and after the requested effective date of a Secure Bed Cap and Floor reduction, the City will be granted a reduction in its Secure Bed Cap and Floor if the following conditions are also met:

 a. The County has not issued to the City a Notification of Intent to Proceed with Jail Bed Expansion Project per Section 7.

 b. The City submits the request for the reduction at least eighteen (18) months before the proposed January 1 effective date, by completing and submitting a Secure Bed Cap and Floor Adjustment Request Form (Exhibit V) specifying the amount of the requested decrease in the Secure Cap and Floor for all remaining years of the Agreement and delivering it to the person designated in Section 13.10 of the Agreement; provided that the County in its sole discretion may agree to a shorter Notification period.

 c. The Secure Bed Floor requested for any calendar year is equal to or greater than the Minimum Secure Bed Floor as shown on Column 5 of Attachment III-3 (Secure Bed Cap and Floor for Seattle) for each corresponding Calendar Year.

 d. The Secure Bed Cap requested is 30% higher than the Secure Bed Floor for each corresponding Calendar Year.

 e. Notwithstanding subsections a and b above, if the County has issued a Notification of Projected Need for Capital Expansion Project indicating that the Jail Bed Expansion Charge is expected to be payable by the City in less than 18 months from the date of such Notification, the City shall be considered to have issued a timely request for a decrease in the secure cap and floor under this Section 6.2.1 if the City files such request otherwise meeting the terms of this Section 6.2.1 within 30 days of receipt of the County's Notification of Projected Need for Capital Expansion Project. The City's request for a Secure Bed Cap and Floor reduction, if and as granted, shall become effective on the January 1 closest to the date that is 18 months following the date of issuance of the Notification of Projected Need for Capital Expansion Project.

 A decrease in the Secure Bed Cap and Floor approved under this Section 6.2.1 is ongoing, that is, shall continue to be in effect for the remainder of the Agreement as shown on the approved Exhibit to the Secure Bed Cap and Floor Adjustment Request Form, unless another reduction is approved per this section or Section 6.2.2, or an increase in the Secure Bed Cap and Floor is approved per Section 6.2.3. Once a decrease in the Secure Bed Cap and Floor is granted under this Section 6.2.1, the County bed capacity removed from the Secure Bed Cap and Floor may be used for other purposes at the sole discretion of the County.

 6.2.2  Temporary (1-year) Decrease in Secure Bed Cap and FloorWhenCity Utilizing Only Jail for Secure Detention . If the City's Certification of City Secure Housing Use (in form of Exhibit IV to this Agreement) confirms that the City will be housing all City Detainees requiring Secure Detention in the Jail from and after the requested effective date of a Secure Bed Cap and Floor reduction, the City will be granted a reduction in its Secure Bed Cap and Floor if the following conditions are also met:

 a. The City requests the reduction no later than July 1st in the year before the proposed effective date, by completing and submitting a Secure Bed Cap and Floor Adjustment Request Form and delivering it to the person designated in Section 13.10 of the Agreement.

 b. The entirety of the City's Detainees requiring Secure Detention are held in the Jail during the calendar year of the requested reduction; and

 c. The Secure Bed Cap requested is 30% higher than the Reduced Bed Floor requested.

 A reduction in the Secure Bed Cap and Floor granted under this section is for a period of one (1) year. The Cap and Floor will increase automatically to the pre-reduction level on January 1 of the next calendar year unless the City has by July 1 requested another reduction in accordance with the conditions of this Section 6.2.2. Within the year of a reduction granted per this Section, the County may use beds that were previously within the Secure Cap for any other purpose, within the County's sole discretion.

 6.2.3  Increase in Secure Bed Cap and Floor . The City may request an increase in the Secure Bed Cap and Floor at least thirty-six (36) months before the requested effective date (January 1) of the increase, by completing and submitting aSecure Bed Cap and Floor Adjustment Request Form and delivering it to the person designated in Section 13.10 of this Agreement; provided that, the Secure Bed Cap requested shall in each calendar year from an after the proposed effective date of the increase be 30% higher than the Reduced Bed Floor for such calendar year; and provided further that upon the City's request, the County in its sole discretion may agree to a shorter Notification period for a Secure Bed Cap and Floor increase than 36 months. The City may request an increase for a limited term of years, after which the Secure Bed Cap and Floor will revert to the prior approved levels. The County is under no obligation to grant a request for an increase in the Secure Bed Cap and Floor. Approval of an increase in any Secure Bed Cap or Floor limit by more than 33% of the corresponding number in the Original Attachment III-3 or 110 beds, whichever is greater, shall require approval of the Parties' respective legislative bodies.

 6.2.4  Adjustment of Attachment III-3 to Reflect Reductions or Increases in Secure Bed Cap and Floor . Any increase or decrease in the Secure Bed Cap and Floor approved per this Section 6.2 shall not be effective until confirmed by the County's signature on the Secure Bed Cap and Floor Adjustment Request Form. The Request Form shall include a revised Attachment III-3, adjusting the numbers in Columns 3 and 4 in said exhibit, to reflect the change requested by the City. The County shall adjust the revised Attachment III-3 as necessary to comply with the terms of the Agreement, including but not limited to the terms of this Section 6. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the City notifies the County of its intent to house the entirety of its City Detainees requiring Secure Detention in Jail, the Parties will in good faith negotiate whether changes to the ratio between the Secure Bed Cap and Floor should be adopted by amendment to this Agreement.

 6.2.5 The Parties recognize that local policy or legislative changes could result in shifting a group of Inmates who are currently the responsibility of the County to be the responsibility of the City for purposes of the Agreement. An example of such a change is an annexation of an unincorporated area by the City. The Parties agree to work together as reasonably practicable in advance of such local policy or legislative changes to estimate the impact of such changes and to negotiate in good faith regarding any proposed change to the City's Secure Bed Cap and Floor. If the Parties are able to agree, any such changes will be made by amendment to this Agreement.

 6.3 By December 31, 2030, at the time of the Jail's Official Daily Population Count, the City agrees to reduce the number of City Inmates in the Jail to 0 and the number of City WER Participants to 0, with the exception that Inmates whose status has changed to City Inmate, or WER participants whose status has changed to City WER Participant will not be included in the calculation of the number of City Inmates or WER Participants if such individuals are removed from the Jail or WER within 72-hours of such change in status.

 For the purpose of determining the number of City Inmates and City WER Participants only, and not for billing purposes, Inmates held on multiple warrants or sentences by the County which include one or more city warrants or sentences in addition to a County and/or state warrant or sentence, and City Inmates or City WER Participants that have been booked into the Jail or WER and the City has not been notified of such booking shall not be considered a City Inmate or City WER Participant. Also, City Inmates housed in the Jail or City WER Participants assigned to WER pursuant to a reciprocal bed-use agreement will not be considered City Inmates or City WER Participants for the purpose of determining the number of City Inmates or City WER Participants.

 6.4 The City can access up to a maximum of 15 WER beds, subject to availability, on a first come, first serve basis; provided further that these beds will not be held in reserve for the City. The County may in its sole discretion provide more than 15 WER beds to City WER Participants.

 6.5 The Jail's capacity limit for Medical Inmates is thirty (30). The Jail's capacity limit for Psychiatric Inmates is one-hundred fifty-one (151). For the purpose of this Section the Medical and Psychiatric Inmate population will be determined following the definitions in Sections 1.23 and 1.27 at the time of the Jail's Official Daily Population Count.

 6.6 When the Jail has reached its capacity limit for either Medical or Psychiatric Inmates as set forth in Section 6.5, the County will provide notice to the City by phone or electronic mail. Such notification will be made to the person designated in Section 13.10 of this Agreement. At the time this notification is made the County may request that the City take custody of a sufficient number of its Medical or Psychiatric Inmates to reduce the number of Medical or Psychiatric Inmates to the capacity limits detailed in Section 6.5, or the County may inform the City that it is willing to continue to house these Inmates.

 6.7 County requests under Section 6.6 will be made as follows. The billable city (under this Agreement or other jail service agreements between the County and cities that have identical provisions as this Section) with the Inmate most recently admitted as Medical or Psychiatric Inmate will be asked to take custody of that inmate. This process will be repeated until such time as the Medical and Psychiatric populations are reduced below capacity limits, or the Jail is willing to house these Inmates.

 6.8 If the County, pursuant to Sections 6.6 and 6.7, requests that the City take custody of Medical or Psychiatric Inmates, the City shall comply with the County's request. The City may take custody of its [1]  Medical or Psychiatric Inmates by picking them up within 24-hours of the County's request, or by providing notice to the County, within 24-hours of the County's request, that the City would like the County to deliver the Inmates to the City's designated drop-off location or a backup location previously provided to the County  [2] . If the City has not picked-up the Medical or Psychiatric Inmate within 24-hours of the County's request, or the City has requested that the County take the Medical or Psychiatric Inmate to the designated drop-off location or backup location, the County will deliver the Medical or Psychiatric Inmate to the City's designated drop-off location or backup location. In either case, the City's designated drop-off location or backup location must accept delivery from the County, and must be available to do so seven days a week, twenty-four hours a day. In all cases, the County shall provide the receiving entity with Continuity of Care Records, in a sealed envelope, at the time custody is

 transferred. The City will ensure that the City and the receiving entity comply with all applicable confidentiality laws and rules. Similarly, the City will ensure that Continuity of Care Records are provided to the County at the time custody of a City Inmate receiving the level of care consistent with a Medical or Psychiatric Inmate is transferred to the County.

 6.9 The County will transport Medical or Psychiatric Inmates to a designated drop-off location or backup location within King County, Washington without charge. The City will pay all transportation costs for Medical or Psychiatric Inmates taken to a designated drop off location or backup location outside of King County, Washington. In no case will the County be obligated to transport a Medical or Psychiatric Inmate out-of- state.

 7.  Jail Planning and Possible Jail Expansion .

 7.1  Jail Planning . The County and the City will share information with the City and other cities that contract with the County for jail services regarding their respective Inmate populations and the need for Secure Detention and alternative means of detention. Specifically, each Party will annually share the latest forecasts for its Inmate populations and all current or planned contracting arrangements to house these Inmates. Taking this information into account, the County will estimate annually when the total forecasted use of the County's Secure Detention facilities will exceed the capacity of such facilities. If the number of years until capacity is exceeded is equal to or less than six (6) years, the County and City agree to explore ways to manage their respective Inmate populations through utilization of alternatives, system improvements and efficient use of existing Jail capacity.

 If at any time, the County determines it advisable to proceed with a project to increase its Secure Detention bed capacity, the County will initiate at its own expense the Pre-design Work for such project, the scope of which may include the option of adding housing units at the Maleng Regional JusticeCenter or other locations. Pre-design Work includes the environmental review process, capital plan preparation, studies and analysis required to meet applicable zoning and land use planning requirements, and a pre-design report for a preferred option if deemed appropriate by the County, all as directly associated with the proposed expansion of Jail Secure Detention capacity and the operation thereof. If expansion occurs, the cost of Pre-design Work will be included in the Total Jail Bed Expansion Capital Cost financed and used to calculate the City's Jail Bed Expansion Surcharge.

 7.2  Jail Bed Expansion Project Notification. The County shall provide Notification to the City in writing if the process in Section 7.1 results in a determination by the County that a Jail Bed Expansion Project will occur. This Notification, referred to as the Notification of Intent to Proceed with Jail Bed Expansion Project, shall include an estimate of: the scope of the project; the Total Jail Expansion Capital Cost; total project capital cost if different from the Total Jail Expansion Capital Cost; financing options under consideration by the County; the timeline for completing construction, including the date that the expansion is expected to become operational and when the County's debt service payments on the long-term debt to finance the project are expected to begin. The Notification of Intent to Proceed with Jail Expansion Project shall be an estimate and is not binding on the County. The Notification of Intent to Proceed with Jail Bed Expansion Project shall be issued at least one (1) year prior to the first day on which the County estimates the City would become responsible for payment of a Jail Bed Expansion Surcharge per Exhibit III, Section 5. The County will provide Notification to the City of the final calculation of the Jail Bed Expansion Surcharge amount not less than 45 days before the first Jail Bed Expansion Surcharge is payable, together with the Schedule of Jail Bed Expansion Surcharge Payments. The County's issuance of a Notification of Intent to Proceed with Jail Bed Expansion Project does not constitute a decision to proceed with construction: any such decision would only occur after any applicable environmental and planning requirements are completed. Additionally, the County may in its sole discretion determine not to pursue a Jail Bed Expansion Project, in which case no Jail Bed Expansion Surcharge, nor any portion of the Pre-design work, will be payable by the City.

 7.3  Payment of Jail Bed Expansion Surcharge . The City will be charged a monthly Jail Bed Expansion Surcharge, calculated per Exhibit III, Section 5. The Jail Bed Expansion Surcharge will be payable from and after the month that the County begins repayment of the long-term debt issued to fund the Jail Bed Expansion, or when the Jail Bed Expansion becomes operational, whichever is first, and will be payable in monthly amounts through the end of the term of the Agreement or the last payment date in the Schedule of Jail Bed Expansion Surcharge Payments, whichever comes first. The County will include the Jail Bed Expansion Surcharge in its monthly bill to the City issued per Section 5 of this Agreement. The Jail Bed Expansion Surcharge shall be due within such time and subject to such withholding and dispute resolution procedures as otherwise provided in Section 5 of this Agreement. The City's payment of the Jail Bed Expansion Surcharge does not provide any rights to the City to access jail beds after the expiration of the Agreement nor grant any ownership or management rights in the expanded facility or other County Jail facilities. The City has no obligation to pay the Jail Bed Expansion Surcharge after expiration of the Agreement; provided, however, that if the Parties negotiate an extension to the Agreement beyond 2030, they agree to negotiate in good faith for continuing the City's Jail Bed Expansion Surcharge as contemplated in the Schedule of Jail Bed Expansion Surcharge Payments as originally issued.

 7.4 This Agreement and the calculation of the Jail Bed Expansion Surcharge assumes that the proceeds of any County voter-approved financing to support the costs of the expansion of County Jail facilities will be applied to support costs associated with the County's regional and unincorporated area jail responsibilities (including specifically the County's responsibilities for felony and unincorporated misdemeanant offender populations) and that such voter-approved funds will not offset any city's local jail service or facility costs (including specifically the costs to the City owing under this Agreement, or the costs owed by any other city for inmates that are the responsibility of such city); provided however, that if other cities are directly provided any financial or other local benefit from such voter approved financing, then the City and County agree to negotiate in good faith adjustments to the Jail Bed Expansion Surcharge. The County and City agree it would not be appropriate for some cities to have access to the benefits, financial or otherwise, from a Secure Detention Jail bed expansion funded by a regional levy while others pay a surcharge or do not have access to these same benefits.

 8.  Indemnification .

 8.1 The County shall indemnify and hold harmless the City and its officers, agents, and employees, or any of them, from any and all claims, actions, suits, liability, loss, costs, expenses, and damages of any nature whatsoever, by reason of or arising out of any negligent action or omission of the County, its officers, agents, and employees, or any of them. In the event that any suit based upon such a claim, action, loss, or damage is brought against the City, the County shall defend the same at its sole cost and expense; provided, that, the City retains the right to participate in said suit if any principle of governmental or public law is involved; and if final judgment be rendered against the City and its officers, agents, and employees, or any of them, or jointly against the City and the County and their respective officers, agents, and employees, or any of them, the County shall satisfy the same.

 8.2 The City shall indemnify and hold harmless the County and its officers, agents, and employees, or any of them, from any and all claims, actions, suits, liability, loss, costs, expenses, and damages of any nature whatsoever, by reason of or arising out of any negligent act or omission of the City, its officers, agents, and employees, or any of them. In the event that any suit based upon such a claim, action, loss, or damage is brought against the County, the City shall defend the same at its sole cost and expense; provided that the County retains the right to participate in said suit if any principle of governmental or public laws is involved; and if final judgment be rendered against the County, and its officers, agents, and employees, or any of them, or jointly against the County and the City and their respective officers, agents, and employees, or any of them, the City shall satisfy the same.

 8.3 In executing this agreement, the County does not assume liability or responsibility for or in any way release the City from any liability or responsibility, which arises in whole or in part from the existence or effect of City ordinances, rules or regulations. If any cause, claim, suit, action or administrative proceeding is commenced in which the enforceability and/or validity of any such City ordinance, rule or regulation is at issue, the City shall defend the same at its sole expense and if judgment is entered or damages are awarded against the City, the County, or both, the City shall satisfy the same, including all chargeable costs and attorney's fees.

 8.4 The terms of this Section 8 "Indemnification" shall survive the termination or expiration of this Agreement.

 9.  Most Favored Treatment .

 9.1 During the term of this Agreement, the County represents and assures the City that no other city or town will be offered a contract covering the Jail, WER or jail services that grants such city or town Favored Treatment (as defined below), unless such contract, in substantially similar form, is also offered through Notification, by the King County Executive to the City.

 9.2 Within 60-days of receipt of an offer that the County represents as being made in accordance with Section 9.1, the City through Notification by its Mayor must either:

 i) Accept the offer and such acceptance means the City acknowledges that the County has complied with Section 9.1;

 ii) Decline the offer; or

 iii) Inform the County that the City believes the offer does not comply with the requirements of Section 9.1 at which point the matter will be deemed referred to JAG pursuant to Section 10 and thereafter either party may pursue dispute resolution per Section 11 of this Agreement.

 If the City within 60-days declines the offer per Section 9.2 (ii), or fails to respond within 60-days in the manner described in Section 9.2 (i), (ii) or (iii), then the City shall be deemed to have waived its right to enforce this Section with respect to the offer.

 9.3 Per Section 13.11 of this Agreement, final execution of any new or amended contract is subject to City Council and County Council approvals.

 9.4 Favored Treatment means that the terms contained in such other contract are clearly preferable to the terms contained in this Agreement, taking into account all provisions, including but not limited to, rates, guaranteed bed capacity, and minimum payment obligations.

 9.5 This Section shall not apply to a) temporary service contracts of twelve months or less in duration; provided that such temporary service contracts shall not cause the City to pay more in Maintenance Charges and booking fees than the City would have paid without such a temporary service contract; b) reciprocal bed use agreements; and c) any agreements among the County and any city or town for additional services not provided for in this Agreement.

 9.6 Notwithstanding anything in this section to the contrary, the Parties acknowledge that a city with a significantly smaller inmate population is subject to proportionally much greater variability in its number of inmates than is the City of Seattle, and therefore, the parties agree that this Section 9 shall not be triggered if the County enters into an agreement substantially similar to this Agreement, except that:

 (A) If the signatory city has an average annual daily population of City Detainees of 10 or less, such agreement need not incorporate a Secure Bed Floor or Minimum Bed Adjustment Charge, as the signatory city and County may agree.

 (B) If the signatory city has an average annual daily population of City Detainees of greater than 10 and less than30, and the Secure Bed Cap is between 30% and 50% higher than the Secure Bed Floor for each corresponding year, (and the Secure Bed Cap and Floor and minimum Secure Bed Floor may be expressed in fractions rather than whole integers), as the signatory city and County may agree.

 10.  Jail Agreement Administration Group (JAG) . A JAG is hereby established to work together to assure the effective implementation of this Agreement and resolve any Agreement administration, implementation or interpretation issues including, without limitation, issues related to Inmate transportation, alternative and community correction programs, coordination with the courts and law enforcement, mental health, drug and alcohol treatment, Agreement interpretation, any capital expenditure charge or budget included in the Maintenance Charge or WER Charge, referrals of disputes (including but not limited to disputes arising under Section 5) and issues related to the expedient transfer of City Inmates into or out of alternative facilities within or outside of King County. The JAG shall be composed of two City representatives and two County representatives (including a representative of the Executive and the Director of DAJD), as follows:

 County Executive Representative (1)

 City of Seattle Representative (2)

 Director of the Department of Adult and Juvenile Detention (1)

 The City of Seattle representatives will be appointed by the Mayor of Seattle. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if additional cities execute an agreement substantially similar to this Agreement, then each such additional city shall be entitled to appoint a representative to the JAG.

 The cities other than Seattle that are party to such substantially similar agreements will determine who their representatives are to the JAG.

 The Parties agree that the JAG has no authority to make a final decision with regard to any matter related to the Agreement. If the City, or the County, is not satisfied with status of a matter after discussion in the JAG, that party retains all rights to seek further legal redress as provided for the Agreement, including referral of matters to dispute resolution per Section 11 of the Agreement. The JAG may meet in concert with other similar jail advisory groups created under other jail service agreements between the County and other cities.

 11.  Dispute Resolution . In the event the Parties are unable to resolve a dispute within 30 days of its referral to the JAG per Section 5 or Section 10, then either Party may pursue the dispute resolution provisions of this Section 11.

 11.1 Either Party may give Notification to the other in writing of a dispute involving the interpretation or execution of the Agreement. Within thirty (30) days of this Notification, the King County Executive and the Mayor of the City shall meet to resolve the dispute. If the dispute is not resolved, then at the request of either Party it shall be referred to non-binding mediation. Except as provided in Section 11.2, the mediator will be selected in the following manner: the City shall propose a mediator and the County shall propose a mediator; in the event the mediators are not the same person, the two proposed mediators shall select a third mediator who shall mediate the dispute. Alternately, the Parties may agree to select a mediator through a mediation service mutually acceptable to both Parties. The Parties shall share equally in the costs charged by the mediator or mediation service.

 11.2 If other cities are party to an agreement substantially similar to this Agreement, each such city shall be promptly sent Notification of the dispute and, any such city shall be given the opportunity to both participate in the initial meeting to resolve the dispute and to participate as a party in mediation of such dispute. In the case of more than two cities participating in a mediation, the parties agree to engage a mediator through a mediator or mediation service acceptable to both KingCounty and a majority of cities participating in the mediation. The County and all cities joining the mediation shall share equally in the costs thereof per Section 11.1. Each party reserves the right to litigate any disputed issue in court, de novo.

 12.  Termination . This Agreement can only be terminated by mutual agreement of the Parties or due to the material breach of a party.

 12.1  Forty Five-Day Notification of Intent to Terminate . Any Party wishing to terminate this Agreement on grounds of a material breach of the other Party shall issue a written Notification of intent to terminate, which Notification shall clearly set forth the grounds for alleging a material breach, not less than forty-five (45) days prior to issuing a ninety (90) day termination Notification under Section 12.2 of this Agreement. Upon receipt of the written Notification of intent to terminate, the Parties will meet to confer on whether there are steps that the non-terminating Party can take in order to avoid a ninety (90) day termination Notification under Section 12.2 of this Agreement. The Parties agree within such forty- five (45) day period to make a good faith effort to resolve any alleged materials breach through the dispute resolution provisions in Section 11 of this Agreement.

 12.2  Ninety-Day Termination Notification . After the forty-five (45) day period has run under Section 12.1 of this Agreement, if the Party that issued the Notification of intent to terminate still desires to terminate this Agreement, said Party shall provide the other Party ninety (90) days written termination Notification, as provided in RCW 70.48.090.

 13.  General Provisions.

 13.1  Other Facilities . This Agreement reserves in each party the power to establish a temporary holding facility during a riot, civil disobedience or natural disaster, to establish group homes or other care or rehabilitation facilities in furtherance of a social service program, to temporarily transfer Inmates to alternative detention facilities in order to respond to Jail overcrowding, and to comply with a final order of a federal court or a state court of record for the care and treatment of Inmates.

 13.2  Grants . Both Parties shall cooperate and assist each other toward procuring grants or financial assistance from the United States, the State of Washington, and private benefactors for the Jail, the care and rehabilitation of Inmates, and the reduction of costs of operating and maintaining Jail facilities.

 13.3  Severability.  If any provision of this Agreement shall be held invalid, the remainder of this Agreement shall not be affected thereby.

 13.4  Remedies.  No waiver of any right under this Agreement shall be effective unless made in writing by the authorized representative of the party to be bound thereby. Failure to insist upon full performance of any one or several occasions does not constitute consent to or waiver of any later non-performance nor does payment of a billing or continued performance after Notification of a deficiency in performance constitute an acquiescence thereto. The Parties are entitled to all remedies in law or equity.

 EXHIBIT I

 Method of Determining Billable Charge and Agency

 Process Overview

 The application of all billing rules in conjunction with Section 1.7 of this Agreement comprises the method for determining the principal basis for booking or confining a person. The County's billing system examines all open and active charges and holds for each calendar day and applies the Billing Priority Rules and Tie Breaker Rules as set forth below. Then the charge billable agency is determined from the billable charge(s) or hold(s) and the application of exception rules, for example, the special DUI sentencing rule or the special six hour rule.

 Billing Priority Rules

 The Billing Priority Group is determined in the following order:

 Tie Breaker Rules

 Tie breaker rules are applied in the following order to the Local Misdemeanor Priority Group (Number 4 under Billing Priority Rules) when there are charges with multiple charge billable agencies. The first rule that applies determines the billable charge(s). The charge billable agency for the selected charge(s) is the billable agency.

 Attachment I-1: City Jail Charges Clarification

 This document contains several examples consistent with Section 1.7 of this Agreement.

 Attachment I-2

 Inmate Transfers: Transfer Request Exemption Criteria, Notice and Billing

 (Relating to Section 1.7.9)

 A. In the event of one or more of the following transfer exception criteriaare met, a transfer may be denied by the County, in which case the person for whom the City has sought a transfer remains a City Inmate:

 (1) Inmate has medical/health conditions/ treatments preventing transfer.

 (2) Transfer location refuses Inmate.

 (3) Inmate refuses to be transported and poses a security risk.

 (4) Inmate misses transport due to being at court or other location.

 (5) City refuses to sign transfer paperwork requiring the City to arrange transportation for Inmate back to KingCounty, if needed, when City sentence ends.

 B. If the County has refused a transfer request and thereafter determines that it no longer needs to detain the person and the person would as a result become a City Inmate, then the County will provide notice to the City that it will become billable for the Inmate. The City will not incur a Maintenance Charge on the day of notice. If the City transfers the Inmate during the six calendar days immediately following the day of notice, it will not incur a Maintenance Charge for the first calendar day following notice, but will incur a Maintenance Charge for each subsequent calendar day until the Inmate is transferred. If the City does not transfer the Inmate from the Jail during this six day period, the City is billable beginning the calendar day following the day of notice from the County.

 C. The terms of this Attachment I-2 may be amended by administrative agreement evidenced by execution in writing by the Mayor of the City of Seattle and King County Executive.

 EXHIBIT II

 Exception to Billing Procedure

 For persons serving the one and two day commitments pursuant to the mandatory DUI sentence grid who report directly from the community to the Jail for incarceration, Inmate day shall not be defined according to Section 1.17 of the Agreement. Instead, Inmate day shall be defined as a twenty-four hour period beginning at the time of booking. Any portion of a twenty-four hour period shall be counted as a full Inmate day. The number of days billed for each sentence shall not exceed the sentence lengths specified on the court commitment.

 Two examples are provided for illustration:

 Two-day sentence served on consecutive days:

 Two-day sentence served on non-consecutive days:

 The Department of Adult and Juvenile Detention will apply this definition of Inmate day to the City's direct DUI one and two- day Inmates by adjusting the City's monthly bill before it is sent to the City. If the changes are not made for some reason, the City will notify the Department of Adult and Juvenile Detention, which will make the necessary adjustments.

 EXHIBIT III

 Calculation of Fees, Charges and Surcharges

 The City shall pay the fees, charges, surcharges and Offsite Medical Charges with such annual adjustments for inflation and other re-sets as described below.

 1.  MAINTENANCE CHARGE, WER CHARGE AND CAPITAL EXPENDITURE CHARGE

 The Maintenance Charge and WER Charge shall be calculated as shown in Attachment III-1 and as described below.

 a. The Maintenance Charge starting January 1, 2012, and for the remainder of the calendar year 2012, excluding any adjustments for Capital Expenditure Charges, will be $120.96. When combined with the Capital Expenditure Charges, the Maintenance Charge for calendar year 2012 is $125.00. The Maintenance Charge shall be annually adjusted as described in Section 7 below and shall be annually inflated and/or re-set as described in Section 7 below. The Maintenance Charge calculation shall include 28.69% of the total DAJD Budgeted Jail Costs associated with booking; this percentage of booking costs to be included in the Maintenance Charge shall remain fixed through the term of this Agreement.

 i. The City will not be charged a Maintenance Charge for a City Inmate where the Inmate has been offsite (e.g. housed outside of the Jail) for all 24 hours of a Surcharge Day and subject to 1:1 Guarding Surcharge for the entirety of such 24 hour period.

 b. WER Charge. In lieu of the Maintenance Charge, the City will be charged a WER Charge for each Inmate Day in which a City WER Participant is in the WER program. Starting January 1, 2012, and for the remainder of the calendar year 2012, excluding any adjustments for Capital Expenditure Charges, the WER Charge will be $88.10. When combined with Capital Expenditure Charges, the WER Charge for calendar year 2012 is $92.14. The WER Charge shall be annually adjusted as described in Section 5 below and shall be annually inflated and/or re- set as described in Section 7 below.

 c. In addition to the annual adjustments to the Maintenance Charge and WER Charge described above, KingCounty will increase the Maintenance Charge and WER Charge to capture the cost of Capital Expenditures. Capital Expenditures are defined as the cost of repairing and renovating current jail capacity and support and administrative facilities that benefit Jail or WER operations. Capital Expenditures include, but shall not be limited to, the Integrated Security Project (ISP) and the Courthouse Seismic Stabilization Project (CSSP). Additional Capital Expenditures will be included in the Maintenance Charge and WER Charge if such expenditures benefit City Inmates or City WER Participants. Any Capital Expenditure that solely benefits CountyInmates will not be charged to the City. Capital Expenditures do not include Jail Bed Expansion Projects. Capital Expenditures do not include Major Maintenance as defined in Attachment III-1.

 i. Capital Expenditures will be calculated in proportion to the square footage that benefits adult detention. Cities will be billed their proportionate share based on the total number of Inmate Days (as defined in Section 1.17). By August 15 of each year, DAJD will estimate the total number of Inmate Days for the following calendar year and provide notice to the City of the Capital Expenditure Charge to be included in the Maintenance Charge and WER Charge in the following calendar year.

 ii. Upon request of the City, the County shall provide its 6- year CIP and its 6-year major maintenance plan to the City. The County will provide a detailed line item budget of each Capital Expenditure. If the City disputes that the Capital Expenditure benefits City Inmates or otherwise disputes the inclusion of the Capital Expenditure or any portion of the Capital Expenditures' budget in the maintenance fee, the matter will be referred to the JAG as described in Section 5 of this Agreement. Capital Expenditures will not be charged to the City to the extent such Capital Expenditures are covered by federal grants, state grants, insurance proceeds, capital maintenance reserves or voter approved capital funding for jail related improvements.

 iii. Capital Expenditures, if debt financed, shall begin being charged when debt service payments begin for the permanent financing of the Capital Expenditure and shall continue until the end of the debt amortization unless the debt amortization is less than fifteen (15) years, in which case the charges to the City will be amortized over fifteen (15) years. If the Capital Expenditure is not debt financed, Capital Expenditure charges shall be based on actual expenditures. The County will make available documentation evidencing such expenditures.

 iv. Beginning January 1, 2012 and continuing through calendar year 2012, the Capital Expenditure Charge for ISP for the City is $3.36 and the Capital Expenditure Charge for the CSSP is $0.68, for a combined total Capital Expenditure Charge of $4.04 to be added to the Maintenance Charge and WER Charge amounts set forth in subparagraphs a and b above.

 2.  BOOKING FEE

 a. The Booking Fee shall be based on the City continuing to not use the County's Personal Recognizance (PR) screeners. The Booking Fee starting January 1, 2012 and for the remainder of the calendar year 2012 will be $95.00, as illustrated in Attachment III-1. The Booking Fee shall be calculated as shown in Attachment III. The Booking Fee shall include 25.88% of the total DAJD Budgeted Jail Costs associated with booking; this percentage of booking costs to be included in the Booking Fee shall remain fixed through the term of this Agreement.

 b. In the event the City municipal court order providing for City PR screeners is revoked or expires, and the City desires to have the County provide PR screeners, the City will provide 1-year advance Notification to the County, and the Parties will enter into good faith negotiations to develop a revised booking fee that will reflect the County's reasonable costs, determined in a manner generally consistent with the rate model for calculating the Booking Fee, to provide this additional service to the City. The revised booking fee must be adopted by amendment to this Agreement approved by the Parties' respective Councils. Until and unless the Parties agree upon a revised booking fee, the County shall be under no obligation to provide PR screener services and may require the City secure such service through alternate means as a pre- requisite to housing City Inmates or serving City WER Participants.

 3.  SURCHARGES

 In addition to payment of the Maintenance Charge or WER Charge and the Booking Fee, the City shall pay Surcharges associated with services provided to City Inmates as described below. The types of services provided to an Inmate associated with each Surcharge, and a general description of each Surcharge, is set forth in Attachment III-2.

 The initial Surcharge amounts described in paragraphs (a) - (d) below shall apply from the January 1, 2012 through December 31, 2012 and shall thereafter be annually adjusted as described in Section 7 below.

 a. Infirmary Care. For Medical Inmates, the City shall pay an Infirmary Care Surcharge of $193.87 for each Surcharge Day.

 b. Non-Acute Psychiatric Care. For Non-Acute Psychiatric Inmates, the City shall pay a Psychiatric Care Surcharge of $61.00 for each Surcharge Day.

 c. Acute Psychiatric Care. For Acute Psychiatric Inmates, the City shall pay an Acute Psychiatric Care Surcharge of $231.11 (which is the sum of the Psychiatric Care Surcharge plus the Acute Psychiatric Housing Surcharge) for each Surcharge Day.

 i. The Acute Psychiatric Housing Surcharge for each Surcharge Day shall be $170.11.

 ii. The Psychiatric Care Surcharge for each Surcharge Day of $61.00 is added to the Acute Psychiatric Housing surcharge for a total Acute Psychiatric Care Surcharge of $231.11.

 d. 1:1 Guarding Surcharge. The 1:1 Guarding Surcharge is the charge imposed when the County dedicates an individual officer to guard a City Inmate. The Surcharge shall be $57.67 per guard for each hour or portion thereof, and as further described in Attachment III-2.

 e. A Surcharge Day is defined as a 24-hour period from midnight to midnight, or any portion thereof, in which an Inmate receives any of the services within the Surcharges listed in subparagraphs (a) - (c) above; provided that with respect to the Infirmary Care Surcharge, Psychiatric Care Surcharge and Acute Psychiatric Surcharge, a maximum of one (1) charge may be imposed within the 24-hour period for a single inmate, and the charge imposed shall be the highest applicable charge. For example, if an inmate is placed in Acute Psychiatric Care, released to the general population, and then again placed in Acute Psychiatric Care all within the same 24-hour period (midnight to midnight), a single Acute Psychiatric Care Surcharge will be imposed. Similarly, if an Inmate is placed in Acute Psychiatric Care and then in Non- Acute Psychiatric Care within the 24-hour midnight to midnight period, then a single Acute Psychiatric Care charge will be imposed.

 4.  OFFSITE MEDICAL CARE CHARGES

 In addition to the Maintenance Charge or WER Charge, the Booking Fee, and the Surcharges detailed above, the City shall be responsible for payment of all Offsite Medical Care Charges incurred by a City Inmate.

 5.  JAIL BED EXPANSION SURCHARGE

 The City shall pay a monthly Jail Bed Expansion Surcharge from and after the date the Jail Bed Expansion Project becomes operational or the month the County begins repayment of long- term debt associated with borrowing to fund the Jail Bed Expansion Project (thus excluding any short-term debt issued in anticipation of paying off such short term debt with long- term debt financing), whichever is first. The Jail Bed Expansion Surcharge is intended to be fixed over time and shall be calculated in accordance with this Section and as shown in the hypothetical calculation in Attachment III-1. The Jail Bed Expansion Surcharge will equal one-twelfth (1/12) of the Annual Debt Service Proxy Amount multiplied by the City's Percentage of Bed Use, where:

 Annual Debt Service Proxy Amount is the equalized annual cost of both principal and interest necessary to repay the Total Jail Expansion Capital Cost (not to exceed the Capital Cost Cap defined below) over the borrowing term (number of years) for the County's long-term debt associated with the Jail Bed Expansion Project, provided that if the County issues such long-term debt with a shorter repayment term than twenty (20) years, the Annual Debt Service Proxy Amount shall be calculated based on a 20-year repayment term by dividing the cumulative principal and interest payable by the County under its debt financing by a 20-year repayment term; and

 City's Percentage of Bed Use is determined by dividing the City's Average Daily Population of City Inmates in Secure Detention in Jail for the three (3) calendar years prior to the opening of the Jail Bed Expansion Project by the Average Daily Population of County Inmates in Secure Detention in County facilities for such period.

 The County shall prepare a Schedule of Jail Bed Expansion Surcharge Payments based on this formula and shall provide Notification of it to the City not less than forty-five (45) days in advance of the first Jail Bed Expansion Surcharge being due. The Schedule shall present the full repayment schedule (covering 20 years or, if longer, the actual debt repayment term) of the Total Jail Expansion Capital Cost, notwithstanding that the Agreement may terminate prior to the end of scheduled payments.

 The Total Jail Expansion Capital Cost used to calculate the Jail Bed Expansion Surcharge shall not exceed the Capital Cost Cap. The Capital Cost Cap is $66 million in 2011 dollars adjusted to the year that construction begins on the Jail Bed Expansion Project, using the "Means Construction Cost Index" for the Seattle area or some other generally accepted construction cost inflation index for the Seattle area.

 6.  MINIMUM BED ADJUSTMENT CHARGE

 A Minimum Bed Adjustment Charge will be payable periodically by the City in accordance with this Section and as calculated per the hypothetical example in Attachment III-1.

 a. Each July and January, beginning July 2012, County will confirm whether, based on the City's filed Certification(s) of Secure Housing Usage, the City has housed in Jail the entirety of City Pre-Trial Detainees requiring Secure Detention over the entire preceding six (6) months, and (for confirmation each January, beginning January 2013) the preceding calendar year. City Detainees on Work Release or in other Community Corrections Programs, whether or not such programs are operated by the County, shall not be considered City Detainees requiring Secure Detention for purposes this Certification.

 b. The County will then determine the average daily number of City Inmates in Jail in the calculation period (the preceding six months and/or preceding calendar year, depending on whether the calculation is made in July or January) and compare that number to the Secure Bed Floor number for the corresponding year in Column 4 of Attachment III-3. If the average daily number of City Inmates in Secure Detention in Jail in the calculation period is less than the Secure Bed Floor number, the City will be charged a Minimum Bed Adjustment Charge.

 c.  Minimum Bed Adjustment Charge Formula . The Minimum Bed Adjustment Charge will equal, for the calculation period (the preceding six months or calendar year as applicable per Subsections 6.c.i and 6.c.ii below), the difference between the cumulative daily Maintenance Charges as applied to the Secure Bed Floor for the corresponding calendar year in Column 4 of Attachment III-3 and the actual cumulative daily Maintenance Charges for the City's Inmates for the calculation period. WER charges paid by the City shall be excluded from the calculation of the Minimum Bed Adjustment Charge.

 i.  All Pre-Trial Detainees Not Housed in Jail: Six Month Charge Calculation and Billing . If, upon review each July and January, of City Certification(s) of Secure Housing Usage, the County confirms that all of the City's Pre-Trial Detainees requiring Secure Detention were NOT housed within Jail in the preceding six months, the County shall calculate whether a Minimum Bed Adjustment Charge is owed by applying the calculation formula using the preceding six months of billable City Inmate Maintenance Charges, (January through June, or July through December).

 ii.  All Pre-Trial Detainees Housed in Jail: Yearly Charge Calculation and Billing . If, upon review each January of the City's Certifications of Secure Housing Usage, the County confirms that all Pre-Trial Detainees requiring Secure Detention were housed in Jail for the entire preceding calendar year, then the County shall calculate whether a Minimum Bed Adjustment Charge is owed by the applying the calculation formula using the preceding calendar year of City Inmate Maintenance Charges.

 d.  Notice and Billing . No later than each August 1 and February 1, the County will transmit a bill to the City for any Minimum Bed Adjustment Charge owed for the preceding six months and/or calendar year as appropriate. If no amount is owed, the County will by such date transmit a notice to the City confirming same. Within forty-five (45) days after receipt of a bill for a Minimum Bed Adjustment Charge, the City shall pay the full amount billed or withhold a portion thereof and provide the County written notice (meeting the requirements of Section 5.2.1) specifying the total amount withheld and the grounds for withholding such amount, together with payment of the remainder of the amount billed (if any amount remains). Withholding of any Minimum Bed Adjustment amount billed or alleging that any Party is in violation of any provision of this Agreement shall be subject to the terms of Section 5 of the Agreement regarding withholding of disputed payments and subject to the dispute resolution procedures in Section 5 of the Agreement.

 7.  INFLATORS AND RE-SETS OF FEES AND CHARGES

 a.  Inflators . All fees and charges, excluding: (1) Offsite Medical Care Charges; (2) the Capital Expenditure Charge components of the Maintenance Charge and WER Charge; and (3) the Jail Bed Expansion Charge, shall be annually inflated by the percentage rates described below, effective January 1 of each calendar year starting January 1, 2013, in order to determine the final rates and charges for said calendar year, subject further to re-set of the underlying "base rates" periodically as described in Subsection 7.e below.

 Non-Medical Charges : the following fees and charges are subject to an annual inflator of the Seattle-Tacoma-Bremerton CPI-W (covering the 12-month period ending in June) plus 1.5%, but shall in no event be lower than 1.5%.:

 i. Maintenance Charge

 ii. WER Charge

 iii. Booking Fee

 iv. Acute Psychiatric Housing Surcharge

 v. 1:1 Guarding

 Medical Charges : the following fees and charges are subject to an annual inflator of the Seattle-Tacoma-Bremerton CPI-W (covering the 12-month period ending in June) plus 3%, but shall in no event be lower than 3%:

 i. Infirmary Care Surcharge

 ii. Psychiatric Care Surcharge

 b.  Final Fee and Charge Notice for Following Calendar Year . No later than August 15 of each year, the County will provide notice to the City of the final fees and charges listed in this Subsection 7.a for the following calendar year reflecting the application of the June-June CPI index in the manner prescribed in Subsection 7.a above.

 c.  Inflation Re-sets . Notwithstanding the terms of Subsections 7.a and 7.b to the contrary, in the event the Seattle-Tacoma-Bremerton CPI-W (June-June) exceeds 8% then, as part of the August 15 final fee and charge notice, the County will include information demonstrating whether, based on factors affecting the DAJD Budgeted Jail Costs including but not limited to personnel costs, food, utilities and pharmaceuticals, the County's reasonably expected inflation experience for the DAJD Budgeted Jail Costs in the next calendar year (the "Expected Inflation Rate") is less than or greater than said CPI-W (June-June) rate. If the Expected Inflation Rate is lower than the CPI-W (June-June) rate, the County will apply the lower of the two rates to the fees and charges listed in this Subsection 7.c for the following calendar year.

 d.  2012 Fees and Charges . Attachment III-1 shows the allocation of 2011 Budgeted Jail Costs used to derive the 2012 fees and charges, applying the inflators in Subsection 7.a above in order to calculate the fees and charges applicable in 2012 as set forth above in Sections 1, 2, 3 and 4.

 e.  Five-Year Base Re-sets for Fees and Charges . Every five years, the base costs on which fees and charges are based will be updated, by applying the previous year's Budgeted Jail Costs to the allocation methodology as illustrated in Attachment III-1. Thus, fees and charges in 2017 will be determined using the model in Attachment III-1 incorporating 2016 Budgeted Jail Costs, and then applying the annual inflators per Subsection 7.a. Similar re-sets shall occur in 2022 and 2027 (together with 2012 and 2017, these years are collectively referred to as the "Base Years"). By March 1 of the calendar year before each Base Year, the County will provide the City written notice including a detailed calculation of the re-set fees and charges for the next occurring Base Year (excluding application of inflators, which will be provided by August 15 per Subsection 7.b above). The Parties shall promptly thereafter meet to review the information and will work in good faith to resolve any questions or issues by May 1 of such year. In the event that the County implements a new accounting system that makes it impracticable to generate the same cost allocations shown in the cost model illustrated in Attachment III-1, the Parties agree that technical adjustments may be made to the rate model in order to recreate as nearly as practicable the original rate model.

 By way of illustration and without limitation:

 ? Year 2013 fees and charges are determined by applying the inflators to 2012 fees and charges per Subsection 7.a.

 ? Year 2014 fees and charges are determined by applying the inflators to 2013 fees and charges per Subsection 7.a.

 ? Year 2015 fees and charges are determined by applying the inflators to 2014 fees and charges per Subsection 7.a.

 ? Year 2016 fees and charges are determined by applying the inflators to 2015 fees and charges per Subsection 7.a.

 ? Year 2017 fees and charges are determined by allocating the 2016 Budgeted Costs per the cost model in Attachment III-1 and applying the inflators per Subsection 7.a.
