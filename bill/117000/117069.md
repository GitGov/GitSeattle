 AN ORDINANCE relating to City employment, to continue to provide a wage supplement and insurance benefits for employees who are mobilized by the United States Armed Forces for active military service; and ratifying and confirming prior acts.

 WHEREAS, Ordinance 120682 authorized the Personnel Director to continue health coverage for employees who are mobilized by the United States Armed Forces for active military service for Operation Enduring Freedom between September 11, 2001, and December 31, 2002; and

 WHEREAS, the City Council approved the extension of health care and other employee benefits to City of Seattle employees who were mobilized for active military duty in 2002, 2003, 2004, and 2005; by Ordinances 121058, 121369, 121692 respectively; and

 WHEREAS, the City by Ordinance 121885 legislated further support for these employees by implementing a wage supplement program to pay them the difference between their base military wages and their base City wages, if higher, while they are on active military duty; and

 WHEREAS, City Council approved Ordinance 122418 to provide retroactive payment of the military pay supplement to certain employees and to align the expiration of the pay supplement and health care benefits so that both wage and insurance benefits provisions expire on December 31, 2010, or when the United States Armed Forces withdraws from Iraq and Afghanistan, whichever occurs first; and

 WHEREAS, City of Seattle employees who are members of the United States military reserves and the National Guard will continue to be activated for duty in Afghanistan, Iraq and elsewhere beyond December 31, 2010; and

 Section 1. Effective January 1, 2011, any employee of the City of Seattle who is ordered to active military duty by the United States government and who has exhausted his or her annual paid military leave benefit and is on unpaid military leave of absence shall be eligible to receive the difference between his or her base military wage and the regular base rate of pay he or she would have received for his or her City position, if higher.

 Section 2. Effective January 1, 2011, any employee of the City of Seattle who is ordered to active military duty by the United States government and who has exhausted his or her annual paid military leave benefit and is on unpaid military leave of absence shall be eligible to retain the medical, dental and vision services coverage and optional insurance coverage, including but not necessarily limited to Group Term Life (Basic and Supplemental), Long Term Disability, and Accidental Death and Dismemberment, provided as a benefit of their employment with the City of Seattle, at the same level and under the same conditions as though they were in the City's employ, pursuant to program guidelines and procedures developed by the Personnel Director.
