 ORDINANCE _________________

 AN ORDINANCE authorizing the levy of regular property taxes by The City of Seattle for collection in 2012, representing an increase above the regular property taxes levied for collection in 2011; and ratifying and confirming certain prior acts.

 WHEREAS, to increase regular property taxes, RCW 84.55.120, as approved by the voters of the State of Washington in "Referendum 47" on November 4, 1997, requires the City to enact a separate ordinance indicating the change in taxes from the previous year in terms of percentage and total amount; and

 WHEREAS, The City of Seattle proposes to make its regular property tax levy for collection in 2012 in the amount reflected in the companion ordinance to this Bill, which is commonly known as the "Long Property Tax Ordinance"; and

 WHEREAS, the Long Property Tax Ordinance for 2012 authorizes an increase over the amount of regular property taxes levied for collection in 2011; and

 WHEREAS, pursuant to RCW 84.55.120, after proper notice was given, the City Council held public hearings on October 4, 2011, and October 26, 2011, to consider The City of Seattle's 2012 budget and the regular property tax levy to support it; and

 WHEREAS, notice of the City Council's consideration of this ordinance has been provided in the usual manner for other proposed City ordinances; NOW, THEREFORE,

 BE IT ORDAINED BY THE CITY OF SEATTLE AS FOLLOWS:

 Section 1. Regular property taxes for collection in 2012 are authorized in the amount reflected in the Ordinance introduced as Council Bill 117338. Not including increases resulting from the addition of new construction, construction of wind turbine facilities classified as personal property, improvements to property, and any increase in the value of state-assessed property, the regular property tax levy for 2012 collection represents an increase over regular property taxes levied for collection in 2011 (excluding the "refund fund levy" in both instances) of $13,769,618, which is a 3.98 percent increase. These regular property tax levies for collection in 2011 and 2012 include regular property tax "levy lid lifts" previously approved by the voters of The City of Seattle.

 Section 2. Any act pursuant to the authority of this ordinance taken after the passage of this ordinance is hereby ratified and confirmed.

 Section 3. This ordinance shall take effect and be in force 30 days after its approval by the Mayor, but if not approved and returned by the Mayor within ten days after presentation, it shall take effect as provided by Seattle Municipal Code Section 1.04.020.

 Passed by the City Council the _____ day of __________________, 2011, and signed by me in open session in authentication of its passage this _____ day of __________________, 2011.
