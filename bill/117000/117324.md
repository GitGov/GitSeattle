 ORDINANCE _________________

 AN ORDINANCE relating to the Seattle Center Department; authorizing execution of a second amendment to the Facility Use and Occupancy Agreement between the City of Seattle and the Seattle Repertory Theatre; and ratifying and confirming certain acts.

 WHEREAS, the Seattle Repertory Theatre (SRT) was founded in 1963 and began operations in the Seattle Center Playhouse, making it one of the longest standing resident organizations at Seattle Center; and

 WHEREAS, Ordinance 109853 passed by the City Council in 1981, authorized an agreement between the City and SRT regarding the design and construction of a theatre on the Seattle Center campus to be the new home for the Seattle Repertory Theatre and authorized a licensing agreement for use of the new theatre by SRT from the inaugural season of 1983-4 through the 2008-9 season, with the agreement expiring May 31, 2009; and

 WHEREAS, a new theatre at Seattle Center was completed in 1983 at a cost of $10 million, with $5.6 million in 1977 bond funds from the City, and $4.4 million from SRT, with the new theatre being named the Bagley Wright Theatre (BWT) in recognition of substantial donations to the project by anonymous private donors in honor of Bagley Wright; and

 WHEREAS, in May 1996, authorized by Ordinance 118109, the City and SRT executed a 30-year Facility Use and Occupancy Agreement ("1996 Agreement") which incorporated a new, second stage addition to the BWT now known as the Leo Kreielsheimer Theatre and extended the term for use of the BWT by 17 years, from 2009 to 2026; and

 WHEREAS, one of the goals of the 1996 Agreement, was for SRT to assume greater financial responsibility for costs of its operations; and

 WHEREAS, under the 1996 Agreement, by June 1, 2009, SRT would assume full responsibility for operating and maintenance costs and building systems of the BWT, except for the roof and exterior shell, consistent with the structure of more recent agreements between Seattle Center and resident arts organizations; and

 WHEREAS, the severe economic downturn which began in 2008 had a dramatic impact on SRT, reducing the value of its endowment and ultimately resulting in a one-third reduction in SRT's operating budget, including layoffs, furloughs and a four-day work week for full-time staff; and

 WHEREAS, due to the impact of the economic downturn, SRT was not able to assume the financial obligations of the 1996 Agreement by June 1, 2009, and initiated discussions with the City on revisions to and/or postponement of certain terms of the 1996 Agreement; and

 WHEREAS, the City and SRT have negotiated a five-year interim agreement which recognizes the ongoing economic challenges while still making progress towards the goals of the 1996 Agreement; and

 WHEREAS, SRT remains committed to assuming financial responsibility for the operating and maintenance expenses of the BWT per the 1996 Agreement, and at the end of this five-year interim agreement, the terms of the 1996 Agreement shall be in effect; NOW THEREFORE,

 BE IT ORDAINED BY THE CITY OF SEATTLE AS FOLLOWS:

 Section 1. As requested by the Seattle Center Director and recommended by the Mayor, the Seattle Center Director, or his designee, is authorized to execute, for and on behalf of The City of Seattle, a second amendment to the 1996 Facility Use and Occupancy Agreement with the Seattle Repertory Theatre substantially in the form of the agreement attached hereto and identified as "SECOND AMENDMENT TO FACILITY USE AND OCCUPANCY AGREEMENT BETWEEN SEATTLE REPERTORY THEATRE AND CITY OF SEATTLE" (Attachment 1), under which, for a five-year interim period from June 1, 2009, through June 30, 2014 certain terms of the 1996 agreement are modified in order to allow the Seattle Repertory Theatre more time to assume certain financial obligations in the 1996 Agreement.

 Section 2. Any act consistent with the authority and prior to the effective date of this ordinance is hereby ratified and confirmed.

 Section 3. This ordinance shall take effect and be in force 30 days after its approval by the Mayor, but if not approved and returned by the Mayor within ten days after presentation, it shall take effect as provided by Seattle Municipal Code Section 1.04.020.

 Attachment 1: SECOND AMENDMENT TO FACILITY USE AND OCCUPANCY AGREEMENT BETWEEN SEATTLE REPERTORY THEATRE AND CITY OF SEATTLE

 Ned Dunn CEN Seattle Rep Amendment ORD August 1, 2011 Version #1

 SECOND AMENDMENT

 TO FACILITY USE AND OCCUPANCY AGREEMENT

 BETWEEN

 SEATTLE REPERTORY THEATRE

 AND

 THE CITY OF SEATTLE

 This SECOND AMENDMENT AGREEMENT is entered into by the CITY OF SEATTLE (hereinafter referred to as "City"), acting by and through its Seattle Center Department, and the SEATTLE REPERTORY THEATRE (hereinafter referred to as "SRT"), a not-for-profit corporation organized under the laws of the State of Washington.

 WHEREAS, the Seattle Repertory Theatre was founded in 1963 and began operations in the Seattle Center Playhouse, making it one of the longest standing resident organizations at Seattle Center; and

 WHEREAS, Ordinance 109853 passed by the City Council in 1981, authorized an agreement between the City and SRT regarding the design and construction of a theatre on the Seattle Center campus to be the new home for the Seattle Repertory Theatre and authorized a licensing agreement for use of the new theatre by SRT from the inaugural season of 1983-4 through the 2008-9 season, with the agreement expiring May 31, 2009; and

 WHEREAS, the new theatre at Seattle Center was completed in 1983 at a cost of $10 million, $5.6 million in 1977 bond funds from the City, and $4.4 million from SRT, with the new theatre being named the Bagley Wright Theatre (BWT) in recognition of substantial donations to the project by anonymous private donors in honor of Bagley Wright; and

 WHEREAS, in May 1996, authorized by Ordinance 118109, the City and SRT executed a 30-year Facility Use and Occupancy Agreement ("1996 Agreement") which incorporated the new, second stage addition to the BWT now known as the Leo Kreielsheimer Theatre and extended the term for use of the BWT by 17 years, from 2009 to 2026; and

 WHEREAS, one of the goals of the 1996 Agreement, as stated in Ordinance 118109, was for SRT to assume greater financial responsibility for costs of its operations; and

 WHEREAS, under the 1996 Agreement, by June 1, 2009, SRT would assume full responsibility for operating and maintenance costs and building systems of the BWT, except for the roof and exterior shell, consistent with the structure of more recent agreements between Seattle Center and resident arts organizations; and

 WHEREAS, the severe economic downturn which began in 2008 had a dramatic impact on SRT, reducing the value of its endowment and ultimately resulting in a one-third reduction in SRT's operating budget, including layoffs, furloughs and a four-day work week for full-time staff; and

 WHEREAS, due to the impact of the economic downturn, SRT was not able to assume the financial obligations of the 1996 Agreement by June 1, 2009 and initiated discussions with the City on revisions to and/or postponement of terms of the 1996 Agreement; and

 WHEREAS, the City and SRT have negotiated a five-year interim agreement which recognizes the ongoing economic challenges while still making progress towards the goals of the 1996 Agreement; and

 WHEREAS, SRT remains committed to assuming financial responsibility for the operating and maintenance expenses of the BWT per the 1996 Agreement, and at the end of this five-year interim agreement, the terms of the 1996 Agreement shall be in effect; NOW THEREFORE,

 The parties agree as follows:

 The ending date of the 1996 Agreement is changed from May 31, 2026 to June 30, 2026 in order to be in alignment with SRT's fiscal year, which runs from July 1 to June 30.

 The term of the 5-year interim agreement begins June 1, 2009 and ends June 30, 2014.

 Year 1 of the interim agreement begins June 1, 2009 and ends June 30, 2010. Years 2 through 5 begin July 1 and end the following June 30.

 During the term of this 5-year interim agreement, provisions of the 1996 Agreement are amended as follows:

 SRT foregoes its 2009 and 2010 contributions to SRT's Replacement Trust Fund.

 SRT makes annual contributions to the SRT Replacement Trust Fund after 2010 as follows:

 2011 -- 1/3 of the 2011 amount in Exhibit 8 of the 1996 Agreement

 2012 -- 2/3 of the 2012 amount in Exhibit 8 of the 1996 Agreement

 2013 and beyond -- 100% of the amount in Exhibit 8 of the 1996 Agreement

 SRT rent continues under the pre-June 1, 2009 terms of the 1996 Agreement and first amendment.

 Seattle Center continues to provide janitorial services at the BWT at no additional cost to SRT.

 Seattle Center maintenance staff (trades and laborers) continues to provide routine maintenance and repair (O&M) services and supplies at the BWT. These routine and repair services are paid for as follows:

 Year 1 -- City pays 100% of routine O&M expenses at the BWT, same as under the pre-June 1, 2009 arrangement in the 1996 Agreement, with funding from the Seattle Center Operating Budget.

 Year 2 -- City pays 1/2 from the Seattle Center Operating Budget and 1/2 from the City's Bagley Wright Theatre Maintenance, Repair and Replacement Fund.

 Year 3 -- SRT pays 2/3 from the SRT Replacement Trust Fund; City pays 1/3 from the City's Bagley Wright Theatre Maintenance, Repair and Replacement Fund.

 Years 4 and 5 -- SRT pays 100% from the SRT Replacement Trust Fund and/or the SRT Operating Budget.

 SRT and City shall work together to commission an assessment of building and theatrical systems in the BWT and the projected costs for maintaining and/or replacing such systems, with the cost of such assessment to be paid from the City's Bagley Wright Theatre Maintenance, Repair and Replacement Fund.

 There will be a moratorium on spending from the City's Bagley Wright Theatre Maintenance, Repair and Replacement Fund and SRT's Replacement Trust Fund, except as agreed upon between the parties in writing, until the building and theatrical systems assessment is completed.

 If a major capital expense need arises that is beyond the resources of the City's Bagley Wright Theatre Maintenance, Repair and Replacement Fund and SRT's Replacement Trust Fund, taking into consideration other obligations of these two Funds, SRT will take the lead in addressing how to fund this need.

 The $1 million SRT capital contribution required under the 1996 Agreement by September 1, 2010, in connection with SRT rent for the BWT being reduced to $1, is delayed by five years to September 1, 2015. In order to preserve the value of this capital contribution, the $1 million capital contribution amount will have annual CPI adjustments from 2010 to 2015. For example, if the CPI adjustment were 3% per year, the required capital contribution by September 1, 2015 would be approximately $1,160,000. Actual CPI adjustments will be calculated in the same manner as for CPI adjustments to SRT rent for the BWT.

 Seattle Center and SRT will review the current mutual reporting requirements of the 1996 Agreement and agree on revisions for this interim period that can reasonably be met by both parties.

 Except to the extent otherwise modified herein, the 1996 Agreement remains in full force and effect. The amendments and modifications to the 1996 Agreement shall terminate as of July 1, 2014 and the Parties will be thereafter bound by the full Agreement unless otherwise agreed, provided that the parties agree that the ending date of the 1996 Agreement is changed from May 31, 2026 to June 30, 2026 to align with the end of SRT's fiscal year.
