Thus if any provision or compliance with any provision of this AGREEMENT violates state or local law, regulation or ordinance, or would require the CONTRACTOR to violate state or local law, regulation or ordinance, the CONTRACTOR agrees to notify WSDOT immediately in writing. Should this occur, WSDOT and the CONTRACTOR agree to make appropriate arrangements to proceed with or, if necessary, expeditiously, terminate the Project.

 Section 32

 Termination

 A. Termination for Convenience. WSDOT and/or the CONTRACTOR may suspend or terminate this AGREEMENT, in whole or in part, and all or any part of the federal and/or state financial assistance provided herein, at any time by written notice to the other PARTY in accordance with 49 CFR Part 18 section 18.44 or 49 CFR Part 19 section 19.61, whichever is applicable. WSDOT and the CONTRACTOR shall agree upon the AGREEMENT termination provisions including but not limited to the settlement terms, conditions, and in the case of partial termination the portion to be terminated. Written notification must set forth the reasons for such termination, the effective date, and in case of a partial termination, the portion to be terminated. However, if, in the case of partial termination, WSDOT determines that the remaining portion of the award will not accomplish the purposes for which the award was made WSDOT may terminate the award in its entirety. WSDOT and/or the CONTRACTOR may  terminate this AGREEMENT for convenience for reasons including, but not limited to, the following:

 1. The requisite federal and/or state funding becomes unavailable through failure of appropriation or otherwise;

 2. WSDOT determines, in its sole discretion, that the continuation of the Project would not produce beneficial results commensurate with the further expenditure of federal and/or state funds;

 3. The CONTRACTOR is prevented from proceeding with the Project as a direct result of an Executive Order of the President with respect to the prosecution of war or in the interest of national defense; or an Executive Order of the President or Governor of the State with respect to the preservation of energy resources;

 4. The CONTRACTOR is prevented from proceeding with the Project by reason of a temporary preliminary, special, or permanent restraining order or injunction of a court of competent jurisdiction where the issuance of such order or injunction is primarily caused by the acts or omissions of persons or agencies other than the CONTRACTOR;

 5. The Federal Government and/or State Government determines that the purposes of the statute authorizing the Project would not be adequately served by the continuation of federal and/or state financial assistance for the Project; or

 6. The Federal Government terminates this AGREEMENT due to a determination that the CONTRACTOR has: (a) willfully misused Federal assistance Funds by failing to make adequate progress on the Project, (b) failed to make reasonable and appropriate use of the Project real property, facilities, or equipment, or (c) failed to comply with the terms of this AGREEMENT. In the event of a termination under this subsection, and the Federal Government exercises its right to require WSDOT to refund any or all of the Federal Funds provided for the Project, the CONTRACTOR shall return all monies reimbursed to it by WSDOT, in the amount required by the Federal Government, within sixty (60) days of its receipt of a certified letter from WSDOT.

 7. In the case of termination for convenience under subsections A.1 through A. 5 above, WSDOT shall reimburse the CONTRACTOR for all costs payable under this AGREEMENT which the CONTRACTOR properly incurred prior to termination. The CONTRACTOR shall promptly submit its claim for reimbursement to WSDOT. If the CONTRACTOR has any property in its possession belonging to WSDOT, the CONTRACTOR will account for the same, and dispose of it in the manner WSDOT directs.

 B. Termination for Default. WSDOT may suspend or terminate this AGREEMENT for default, in whole or in part, and all or any part of the federal financial assistance provided herein, at any time by written notice to the CONTRACTOR, if the CONTRACTOR materially breaches or fails to perform any of the requirements of this AGREEMENT, including:

 1. Takes any action pertaining to this AGREEMENT without the approval of WSDOT, which under the procedures of this AGREEMENT would have required the approval of WSDOT;

 2. Jeopardizes its ability to perform pursuant to the AGREEMENT, United States of America laws, Washington state laws, or local governmental laws under which the CONTRACTOR operates.

 3. Fails to make reasonable progress on the Project or other violation of this AGREEMENT that endangers substantial performance of the Project; or

 4. Fails to perform in the manner called for in this AGREEMENT or fails to comply with, or is in violation of, any provision of this AGREEMENT. WSDOT shall serve a notice of termination on the CONTRACTOR setting forth the manner in which the CONTRACTOR is in default hereunder. If it is later determined by WSDOT that the CONTRACTOR had an excusable reason for not performing, such as events which are not the fault of or are beyond the control of the CONTRACTOR, such as a strike, fire or flood, WSDOT may: (a) allow the CONTRACTOR to continue work after setting up a new delivery of performance schedule, or (b) treat the termination as a termination for convenience.

 C. WSDOT, in its sole discretion may, in the case of a termination for breach or default, allow the CONTRACTOR ten (10) business days, or such longer period as determined by WSDOT, in which to cure the defect. In such case, the notice of termination will state the time period in which cure is permitted and other appropriate conditions. If the CONTRACTOR fails to remedy to WSDOT's satisfaction the breach or default within the timeframe and under the conditions set forth in the notice of termination, WSDOT shall have the right to terminate this AGREEMENT without any further obligation to CONTRACTOR. Any such termination for default shall not in any way operate to preclude WSDOT from also pursuing all available remedies against CONTRACTOR and its sureties for said breach or default.

 D. In the event that WSDOT elects to waive its remedies for any breach by CONTRACTOR of any covenant, term or condition of this AGREEMENT, such waiver by WSDOT shall not limit WSDOT's remedies for any succeeding breach of that or of any other term, covenant, or condition of this AGREEMENT.

 Section 33

 Forbearance by WSDOT Not a Waiver

 Any forbearance by WSDOT in exercising any right or remedy hereunder, or otherwise afforded by applicable law, shall not be a waiver of or preclude the exercise of any such right or remedy.

 Section 34

 Waiver

 In no event shall any WSDOT payment of grant funds to the CONTRACTOR constitute or be construed as a waiver by WSDOT of any CONTRACTOR breach, or default, and shall in no way impair or prejudice any right or remedy available to WSDOT with respect to any breach or default. In no event shall acceptance of any WSDOT payment of grant funds by the CONTRACTOR constitute or be construed as a waiver by CONTRACTOR of any WSDOT breach, or default which shall in no way impair or prejudice any right or remedy available to CONTRACTOR with respect to any breach or default.

 Section 35

 WSDOT Advice

 The CONTRACTOR bears complete responsibility for the administration and success of the work as it is defined in this AGREEMENT and any amendments thereto. Although the CONTRACTOR may seek the advice of WSDOT, the offering of WSDOT advice shall not modify the CONTRACTOR's rights and obligations under this AGREEMENT and WSDOT shall not be held liable for any advice offered to the CONTRACTOR.

 Section 36

 Limitation of Liability and Indemnification

 A. The CONTRACTOR shall indemnify and hold harmless WSDOT, its agents, employees, and officers and process and defend at its own expense any and all claims, demands, suits at law or equity, actions, penalties, losses, damages, or costs (hereinafter referred to collectively as "claims"), of whatsoever kind or nature brought against WSDOT arising out of, in connection with or incident to this AGREEMENT and/or the CONTRACTOR's performance or failure to perform any aspect of this AGREEMENT. This indemnity provision applies to all claims against WSDOT, its agents, employees and officers and subcontractors arising out of, in connection with or incident to the negligent acts or omissions of the CONTRACTOR, its agents, employees and officers. Provided, however, that nothing herein shall require the CONTRACTOR to indemnify and hold harmless or defend the WSDOT, its agents, employees or officers to the extent that claims are caused by the negligent acts or omissions of the WSDOT, its agents, employees or officers. The indemnification and hold harmless provision shall survive termination of this AGREEMENT.

 B. The CONTRACTOR shall be deemed an independent contractor for all purposes, and the employees of the CONTRACTOR or its subcontractors and the employees thereof, shall not in any manner be deemed to be the employees of WSDOT.

 C. The CONTRACTOR specifically assumes potential liability for actions brought by CONTRACTOR's employees and/or subcontractors and solely for the purposes of this indemnification and defense, the CONTRACTOR specifically waives any immunity under the State Industrial Insurance Law, Title 51 Revised Code of Washington.

 D. In the event either the CONTRACTOR or WSDOT incurs attorney's fees, costs or other legal expenses to enforce the provisions of this section of this AGREEMENT against the other PARTY, all such fees, costs and expenses shall be recoverable by the prevailing PARTY.

 Section 37

 Governing Law, Venue, and Process

 This AGREEMENT shall be construed and enforced in accordance with, and the validity and performance thereof shall be governed by the laws of the State of Washington. In the event that either PARTY deems it necessary to institute legal action or proceedings to enforce any right or obligation under this AGREEMENT, the PARTIES hereto agree that any such action shall be initiated in the Superior Court of the State of Washington situated in Thurston County. The CONTRACTOR hereby accepts service of process by registered mail consistent with RCW 4.28.080(1) or (2) as applicable. Each PARTY shall bear its own legal costs and expenses, including attorney fees, in any such litigation.

 Section 38

 Severability

 If any covenant or provision of this AGREEMENT shall be adjudged void, such adjudication shall not affect the validity or obligation of performance of any other covenant or provision, or part thereof, that in itself is valid if such remainder conforms to the terms and requirements of applicable law and the intent of this AGREEMENT. No controversy concerning any covenant or provision shall delay the performance of any other covenant or provision except as herein allowed.

 Section 39

 Counterparts

 This AGREEMENT may be executed in several counterparts, each of which shall be deemed to be an original having identical legal effect. The CONTRACTOR does hereby ratify and adopt all statements, representations, warranties, covenants, and agreements and their supporting materials contained and/or mentioned in such executed counterpart, and does hereby accept State Funds and agrees to all of the terms and conditions thereof.

 Section 40

 This AGREEMENT is executed by the Director of the Public Transportation Division, State of Washington, Department of Transportation or the Director's designee, not as an individual incurring personal obligation and liability, but solely by, for, and on behalf of the State of Washington, Department of Transportation, in his/her capacity as Director of the Public Transportation Division.
