 Section 2. Sections 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13 and 14 of Ordinance 118908, as amended by Ordinance 121855, are amended as follows:

 1.  Permission.  Subject to  the  terms and conditions of this ordinance, permission ((~~is hereby~~))  (also referred to in this ordinance as a permit) is  granted to Quadrant Corporation,  and  its successors and assigns ((~~("Permittee")~~))  as approved by the Director of the Seattle Department of Transportation, (Permittee)  to construct, maintain ,  and operate a ramp for vehicular and pedestrian access , including parking and landscape areas adjacent to the east and west sides of the ramp in the North Northlake Way right- of-way (collectively ramp)  over and across North Northlake Way, located beneath the George Washington Memorial (Aurora Avenue) Bridge. The ((~~access~~)) ramp will be approximately 38 feet in width and will extend south from the southerly margin of North 34th Street, between several support columns of the George Washington Memorial (Aurora Avenue) Bridge, to the southerly margin of North Northlake Way, more specifically described as follows:

 That portion of North Northlake Way in the Southwest Quarter of Section 18, Township 25 North, Range 4 East, W.M. in King County, Washington.

 ((~~Said~~))  The  ramp will consist of concrete retaining walls with earth backfill and a paved asphalt surface, and will  include parking and landscape areas adjacent to the east and west sides of the ramp in the North Northlake Way right-of-way. These parking and landscape areas are to be maintained by the Permittee and recognized as compensation for public access to the Burke- Gilman trail and shall be excluded from the calculation of the annual fee as required in Section 13C. The purpose of the ramp is to  provide  vehicular and pedestrian  access to the Quadrant Lake Union Center,  adjoining properties, and public right-of-way .

 2.  Term.  The permission ((~~herein~~)) granted to the Permittee,  and  its successors and assigns  as approved by the Director of the Seattle Department of Transportation (Director),  shall be for a term of ten ((~~(10)~~)) years, commencing on the effective date of this ordinance and terminating at 11:59 p.m. on the last day of the tenth year((~~; provided, however, that upon~~)) . Upon  written application of the Permittee at least ((~~thirty (30)~~))  180  days before expiration of the term, the Director ((~~of Transportation ("Director")~~))  or the City Council  may renew the permit  twice, each time  for ((~~two (2)~~))  a  successive ten ((~~(10)~~)) - year ((~~terms, provided further that the~~))  term. The  total term of the permission((~~as originally granted and thus extended~~))  , including renewals,  shall not exceed ((~~thirty (30)~~))  30  years, subject to the right of ((~~The~~))  the  City of Seattle ((~~("City")~~))  (City) to require the removal of the ramp or to revise  by ordinance ((~~to then revise any of the terms and conditions contained herein.~~))  any of the terms and conditions of the permission granted by this ordinance. The Permittee shall submit any application for a new permission no later than 180 days prior to the expiration of the then-existing term.

 3.  Removal for public use or cause.  The ((~~permit~~))  permission  granted ((~~hereby~~)) is subject to ((~~primary and secondary~~)) use  of the street right-of-way  by the  City and the  public for travel ,  ((~~and~~)) utility purposes, and ((~~the~~))  other public uses or benefits. The  City expressly reserves the right to  deny renewal, or terminate the permission at any time prior to expiration of the initial term or any renewal term, and  require the Permittee to remove the  ramp,  or any portion thereof  or installation thereon,  at  the  Permittee's sole cost and expense in the event that:

 (a) The City Council determines((~~,~~)) by ordinance((~~,~~)) that the space occupied by the ramp is necessary for any ((~~primary or secondary~~)) public use or benefit((~~,~~)) or that the ramp interferes with any ((~~primary or secondary~~)) public use or benefit; or

 (b) The Director ((~~of Transportation ("Director")~~)) determines that  use of the ramp has been abandoned; or

 (c) The Director determines that  any term or condition of this ordinance has been violated((~~,~~)) and ((~~such~~))  the  violation ((~~is~~))  has  not  been  corrected by the Permittee ((~~with thirty (30) days of~~))  by the compliance date after a  written ((~~notification from~~))  request by  the City  to correct the violation (unless a notice to correct is not required due to an immediate threat to the health or safety of the public) .

 4.  Permittee's obligation to remove and restore.  ((~~In the event that the permit~~))  If the permission granted  is not renewed  at the expiration of a term , or  if  the permission ((~~hereby granted extends to its termination in thirty (30) years, or the City orders removal of the ramp pursuant to the terms of this ordinance,~~)) expires without an application for a new permission being granted, or if the City terminates the permission, then within ((~~ninety (90)~~))  90  days after ((~~such~~)) expiration((~~, termination or order of removal~~))  or termination of permission , or prior to ((~~the~~))  any earlier  date stated in an ((~~"Order to Remove", as the case may be,~~)) ordinance or  order requiring removal of the ramp,  the Permittee shall , at its own expense,  remove the ramp and ((~~shall place~~)) all  of the Permittee's equipment and property and replace and restore all  portions of the street  right-of-way or public place  that may have been disturbed for any part of the ramp((~~,~~)) in as good condition for public use as they were prior to construction((~~,~~))  of the ramp  and in at least as good condition in all respects as the abutting portions ((~~thereof.

 Failure to remove the ramp as required by this section is a violation of Chapter 15.90 of the Seattle Municipal Code (SMC) (or successor provision); however, applicability of Chapter 15.90 does not eliminate any remedies available to the City under this ordinance or any other authority. If the Permittee does not timely fulfill its obligations under this section, the City may in its sole discretion remove the ramp and restore the street right-of-way or public place at the Permittee's expense, and collect such expense in the manner provided by law.

 6.  Failure to correct unsafe condition.  After  written  notice to the Permittee((~~,~~)) and failure of the Permittee to correct ((~~said~~))  an  unsafe ((~~or risk prone~~)) condition within the time stated in ((~~such~~))  the  notice, the Director may order the ramp closed  or removed at the Permittee's expense  if the Director deems that it has become unsafe or creates a risk of injury to the public. ((~~In a situation in which~~))  If  there is an immediate threat to the health or safety of the public,  a  notice  to correct  is not required.

 7.  Continuing obligations.  ((~~Not withstanding~~))  Notwithstanding  termination or expiration of the permission granted, or  closure or  removal of the ramp ,  the Permittee shall remain bound by its obligation under this ordinance until ((

 13 C. Annual fees. Beginning on March 29, 2010, and annually thereafter, the Permittee shall  ((~~and in addition shall~~)) promptly pay to the City ((~~in advance~~)) ,  upon statements or invoices ((~~rendered~~))  issued  by the Director ,  an annual fee  of $3,268, or as adjusted annually thereafter,  for the privileges granted ((~~and exercised hereunder~~~~of Seven Hundred Fifty-Three ($753.00)~~))  by this ordinance for the use and occupation of the ramp .

 Adjustments to the annual fee ((~~amount~~)) shall be made in accordance with a term permit fee schedule adopted by the City Council ((~~by ordinance~~)) and may be ((~~adjusted~~))  made  every year.

This adjustment will be calculated by adjusting the previous year's fee ((~~amount~~)) by the percentage change between the two most recent year-end values available of the Consumer Price Index for the Seattle-Tacoma-Bremerton Area, All Urban Consumers, All Products, Not Seasonally Adjusted. All payments shall be made to the City Finance Director for credit to the Transportation Operating Fund.

 If there is construction-related work in the public right-of-way and the ramp is designated an official vehicle detour route by an SDOT approved traffic control plan or by prior approval of the Director, the annual fee may be pro- rated and credited for the following year, based on the amount of time either the construction-related work occurs in the public right-of-way or the ramp is designated an official vehicle detour route. Pro-rated annual fees are subject to final approval by the Director and will apply to the annual fee for the following year. If the annual fee is pro-rated, the Permittee shall allow the use of the portion of the ramp located on the Permittee's property without further costs to the City for use of the ramp.
