 ORDINANCE _________________

 AN ORDINANCE relating to solid waste taxation; amending section 5.48.055 of the Seattle Municipal Code; and increasing the transfer tax rate effective January 1, 2011.

 WHEREAS, the City established per-ton taxes on the transfer of Solid Waste in the city that support the costs of the Clean Cities programs, which combat litter, illegal dumping and graffiti; and

 WHEREAS, in 2010 the Seattle City Auditor completed a report on City graffiti control efforts that included recommendations for improved in-community coalition building, outreach, and graffiti data bases;

 WHEREAS, the 2010 Auditor recommendations were considered by the Seattle City Council's Seattle Public Utilities and Neighborhoods (SPUN) Committee during its review of proposed 2011-2012 solid waste rates and the Committee recommended implementation by Seattle Public Utilities of certain Auditor recommendations, funded by an increase in solid waste transfer taxes; NOW, THEREFORE,

 BE IT ORDAINED BY THE CITY OF SEATTLE AS FOLLOWS:

 Section 1. Section 5.48.055 of the Seattle Municipal Code, last amended by Ordinance 122842, is hereby amended as follows:

 5.48.055 Solid Waste activities subject to tax - Amount.

 There is levied upon, and shall be collected from everyone including The City of Seattle, on account of the following business activities engaged in or carried on with respect to solid waste, an annual license fee or occupation tax in the amount to be determined by the application of the rates given below:

 A. Transfer tax. There is imposed upon everyone engaged in or carrying on the business of operating a solid waste transfer station or upon the business of transferring solid waste generated in or outside of Seattle from one (1) mode of transportation to another a transfer tax equal to the solid waste tons handled for transportation or transported for landfill or incineration disposal purposes multiplied by the following rates. ((~~Effective through December 31, 2006, a rate of Six Dollars and Forty Five Cents ($6.45) per ton. Effective January 1, 2007 through December 31, 2009, a rate of Seven Dollars and Fifty Cents ($7.50) per ton.~~)) Effective January 1, 2010 a rate of Eight Dollars and Fifty Cents ($8.50) per ton.  Effective January 1, 2011 a rate of Eight Dollars and Sixty Nine Cents ($8.69).  To prevent pyramiding of the tax under this subsection when two (2) or more transfers occur in Seattle, the tax is imposed only upon the last transferor and shall not apply to earlier transfers. Solid waste is transferred from one (1) mode of transportation equipment to another, whenever it is moved from a motor vehicle (including, for example, landgrading or earthmoving equipment), barge, train or other carrier to another motor vehicle (including landgrading or earthmoving equipment), barge, train or other carrier, irrespective of whether or not temporary storage occurs in the process. Solid waste shall not be considered transferred if the solid waste was generated and placed in a sealed shipping container outside of the city prior to being moved from one mode of transportation to another within the city or the solid waste was put into a sealed shipping container at a transfer station and subjected to the transfer tax prior to being delivered to the railhead. Beginning January 1, 2009, the transfer tax shall also be imposed on the last transfer in the city of construction, demolition, and landclearing solid waste placed into an intermodal container at the construction, demolition, or landclearing site and transported for landfill or incineration disposal outside of the city. Solid waste transported for recycling, reuse, yard and food waste destined for composting, items to be scrapped for salvage, solid waste used for beneficial use as approved by Seattle Public Utilities, soils, dangerous waste and hazardous substances, and sand and gravel for construction of a public improvement shall not be included in the tonnage by which the transfer tax is measured. The measure of the transfer tax is the actual tonnage of the last in-city transfer of solid waste materials destined for landfill, or incineration disposal unless excluded above, and it is the intent of this subsection that all solid waste generated within the City, unless excluded above, destined to a landfill or incineration disposal be subject to this transfer tax.

 * * *

 Section 2. This ordinance does not affect any existing right acquired or liability or obligation incurred under the sections amended or repealed in this ordinance or under any rule or order adopted under those sections, nor does it affect any proceeding instituted under those sections.

 Section 3. This ordinance shall take effect and be in force 30 days from and after its approval by the Mayor, but if not approved and returned by the Mayor within ten days after presentation, it shall take effect as provided by Seattle Municipal Code Section 1.04.020.
