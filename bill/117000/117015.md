 Attachment 1

 AGREEMENT REGARDING DISTRIBUTION OF MOHAI FACILITY PROCEEDS

 BY AND BETWEEN THE CITY OF SEATTLE,

 A WASHINGTON MUNICIPAL CORPORATION

 AND HISTORICAL SOCIETY OF SEATTLE AND KING COUNTY,

 A WASHINGTON NONPROFIT CORPORATION

 This Agreement, dated _________________, 2010, between The City of Seattle ("City") and the Historical Society of Seattle and King County ("MOHAI").

 WHEREAS, pursuant to Ordinance 123132, the City and MOHAI entered into a Project Development Agreement ("Development Agreement") allowing MOHAI to develop and use the Lake Union Armory building for a new regional history museum; and

 WHEREAS, the Development Agreement provides that the City will transfer to MOHAI all of the proceeds the City receives from the State of Washington Department of Transportation ("WSDOT") for its acquisition of MOHAI's museum building in McCurdy Park; and

 WHEREAS, under a settlement agreement between the City, MOHAI and WSDOT, WSDOT has agreed to pay $40 million for the acquisition of MOHAI's building in two installments of $20 million each, one payable in 2010 and the second one payable on or before August 1, 2011 (the "Building Payments); and

 WHEREAS, in Ordinance 123408, the City agreed to pay the Building Payments to MOHAI as soon as practicable after such funds are received by the City; and

 WHEREAS, the City has expressed an interest in having access to a portion of the Building Payments for a period of time to help ameliorate the impact of a projected severe revenue shortfall in its 2011 and 2012 General Fund budgets; and

 WHEREAS, MOHAI wishes to support the City in addressing its short-term budget problems by accepting deferred payment of $8.5 million of its second installment of Building Payments;

 NOW, THEREFORE, for good and valuable consideration, receipt of which is hereby acknowledged, the parties agree as follows:

 1. From the second $20 million installment of Building Payments due from WSDOT on or before August 1, 2011, the City will pay MOHAI $11.5 million as soon as possible after the City receives such funds. The City shall pay the remaining $8.5 million (the "Retained Funds") to MOHAI as described below, first from the City's share of any payments the City receives as a result of WSDOT's acquisition of land within the MOHAI Use Area ("Land Payments"). The parties agree that no payment will be due until February 1, 2013, when the City becomes obligated to promptly pay to MOHAI the amount of Land Payments received to that date or $8.5 million, whichever is less. Thereafter, the City shall continue to promptly pay to MOHAI as much of the entire amount of Retained Funds as may be necessary to fully repay such funds to MOHAI from the City's share of Land Payments as and when such Land Payments are received by the City. The following schedule provides for minimum payments to be paid to MOHAI from City funds other than the City's share of Land Payments in the event the City's share of any Land Payments is not sufficient to fully restore the Retained Funds more quickly:

 a. On February 1, 2013, the City will pay MOHAI a minimum of $2.5 million.

 b. On February 1, 2014, unless MOHAI has already received at least $5 million of the Retained Funds, the City will pay MOHAI $2.5 million, less any portion of the $2.5 million previously paid to MOHAI from City shares of Land Payments.

 c. On February 1, 2015, unless MOHAI has already received the full $8.5 million of the Retained Funds, the City will pay MOHAI $3.5 million, less any portion of the $3.5 million previously paid to MOHAI from City shares of Land Payments.

 2. The City's repayment obligation is not contingent on its receipt of any Land Payments and payments required under Paragraph 1(a) -- (c) shall be made from other City funds if Land Payments are not available when such payments are due. As noted, commencing on February 1, 2013, and continuing thereafter, the City will pay its share of any Land Payments received by and after February 1, 2013 to MOHAI as promptly as possible after any Land Payments are received until the $8.5 million in Retained Funds has been fully distributed to MOHAI. All payments to MOHAI of the Retained Funds required under Paragraph 1 will be accelerated in whole or in part as such compensation is actually received by the City. No other use of the City's share of any such Land Payments shall have a higher priority than restoration and payment to MOHAI of the Retained Funds.

 3. The City's retention of the amounts as described above shall not constitute a loan from MOHAI to the City, and the City shall not be obligated to pay interest to MOHAI on the Retained Funds and any interest earned on such Retained Funds during the term of this Agreement shall accrue to the City.

 4. The City's payment obligation described above will be absolute and irrevocable and shall not be subject to delay or diminution by setoff, counterclaim, abatement or otherwise.

 5. Nothing in this Agreement shall reduce or in any way affect the prompt provision to MOHAI of the full amount of any payments to which it is otherwise entitled, specifically including but not limited to MOHAI's own separate share of any Land Payments, under terms of the Agreement Regarding Assignment of Acquisition/Condemnation Proceeds, as amended, and as confirmed by Ordinance 123408 and otherwise as provided in Ordinance 123408, except for the second $20 million installment for acquisition of the MOHAI museum building in McCurdy Park due from WSDOT on or before August 1, 2011.
