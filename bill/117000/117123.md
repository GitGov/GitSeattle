 WHEREAS, Ordinance 123447 authorizes the City to place vehicles that have four or more outstanding parking infractions on a list of scofflaws and to immobilize them using a "boot," commencing on July 1, 2011; and

 WHEREAS, Ordinance 123447 provides that a vehicle may be removed from the scofflaw list or released from immobilization upon full payment (or entry into a payment plan) of all "penalties, fines, or fees owed relating to all parking citations, plus all immobilization, towing, and storage charges and administrative fees"; and

 WHEREAS, it is necessary to more specifically identify the items that may be collected in order to more fully inform the public of those items and to promote fairness;

 NOW, THEREFORE,

 BE IT ORDAINED BY THE CITY OF SEATTLE AS FOLLOWS:

 Section 1. Section 11.35.010 of the Seattle Municipal Code, as established by Ordinance 123447, is amended as follows:

 11.35.010 Scofflaw list

 * * *

 C. A vehicle shall remain on the scofflaw list until all ((~~penalties, fines, or fees owed relating to all parking citations, plus all immobilization, towing, and storage charges and administrative fees~~))  outstanding parking infraction penalties, court costs (including but not limited to collection agency remuneration authorized under RCW 3.02.045), default penalties on parking traffic infractions imposed under Section 11.31.120, immobilization release fees imposed under subsection 11.35.020.H, costs of impoundment (including removal, towing and storage fees) imposed under Section 11.30.120, towing administrative fees imposed under Section 11.30.290 and immobilization administrative fees under subsection 11.35.020.H, and interest, have been paid, or a time payment plan has been arranged with the Seattle Municipal Court or their authorized agent.

 * * *

 Section 2. Section 11.35.020 of the Seattle Municipal Code, as established by Ordinance 123447, is amended as follows:

 11.35.020 Immobilization

 * * *

 D. The vehicle may be released from immobilization when the vehicle owner or an agent of the owner pays all outstanding ((~~penalties, fines, or fees owed for all parking citations, plus all immobilization, towing, and storage charges and administrative fees,~~))  parking infraction penalties, court costs (including but not limited to collection agency remuneration authorized under RCW 3.02.045), default penalties on parking traffic infractions imposed under Section 11.31.120, immobilization release fees imposed under subsection 11.35.020.H, costs of impoundment (including removal, towing and storage fees) imposed under Section 11.30.120, towing administrative fees imposed under Section 11.30.290 and immobilization administrative fees under subsection 11.35.020.H, and interest,  or enters into a time payment agreement for the payment thereof. Upon full payment or upon entry into a time payment agreement, the Seattle Police Department or other authorized agent of the City shall promptly remove or enable the removal of the boot from the vehicle. If payment is made in full, the vehicle shall be removed from the scofflaw list and shall not be subject to immobilization or impoundment for the paid citations. Upon entry into a time payment agreement, the vehicle shall be temporarily removed from the scofflaw list and shall not be subject to immobilization, provided, however, that the vehicle shall be returned to the scofflaw list and be subject to immobilization if the owner defaults on the time payment agreement. A registered owner who defaults on a time payment agreement shall not be given another opportunity to make a time payment arrangement and therefore, payment for all ((~~penalties, fines, or fees owed for all parking citations, plus all immobilization, towing, and storage charges and administrative fees~~))  outstanding amounts above shall be made in full before the vehicle may be removed from the scofflaw list or released from immobilization or impound.

 * * *

 H. The Director of Finance and Administrative Services shall determine and set an immobilization fee and an administrative fee in amounts such that the sum of such fees do not exceed the  sum of the lowest impound fee, minimum storage fee, and  administrative fee for vehicle impoundment under Section 11.30.120. An administrative fee, if any, shall be levied when the boot is removed. The administrative fee shall be collected by the contractor releasing the vehicle from immobilization, shall be remitted to the Department of Finance and Administrative Services, and shall be deposited in an appropriate account.

 * * *

 Section 3. This ordinance shall take effect and be in force 30 days after its approval by the Mayor, but if not approved and returned by the Mayor within ten days after presentation, it shall take effect as provided by Seattle Municipal Code Section 1.04.020.
