 (a) Buyer shall pay the amount specified in the invoice in immediately available funds by wire or electronic fund transfer to the account set forth in Exhibit C unless otherwise provided pursuant to the operating terms of the Administrator or other Delivery mechanism of the Applicable Program. All invoices under this Master Agreement will be due and payable on or before the later of the 20th day of each month, or 10th day after receipt of the invoice or, if such day is not a Business Day, then on the next Business Day.

 (b) Any failure by Buyer to make a payment will not excuse Buyer's performance, and, unless otherwise provided in a Transaction, any failure by Seller to Deliver the quantity agreed to in the Transaction will not excuse Seller's performance.

 (c) Any amounts not paid by the due date are delinquent and will accrue interest at the Prime Rate until an Event of Default has been declared, in which case such amounts will bear interest at the Prime Rate of interest plus three percent per annum.

 (d) A Party may, in good faith, dispute the correctness of any invoice within one year. If an invoice or portion thereof is disputed, the undisputed portion of the invoice must be paid when due, with notice of the objection given to the other Party. Any invoice dispute must be in writing and state the basis for the dispute, which must be in good faith. Subject to Section 5.4, a Party may withhold payment of the disputed amount until two Business Days following the resolution of the dispute, and any amounts not paid when originally due will bear interest at the Prime Rate from the due date as originally invoiced. Inadvertent overpayments will be returned upon request or deducted by the Party receiving such overpayment from subsequent payments, with interest at the Prime Rate of interest from and including the date of such overpayment. Any dispute with respect to an invoice is waived unless the other Party is notified in accordance with this Section within  one year after the invoice is rendered.

 2.5 Confirmation. The parties shall confirm a Transaction by executing a Confirmation substantially in the form of Exhibit A ("Confirmation Agreement -- Renewable Energy Certificates") to this Master Agreement.

 2.6 Taxes and Fees. Seller will be responsible for any Taxes imposed on the creation, ownership, or transfer of Product under this Master Agreement up to and including the time and place of its Delivery. Buyer will be responsible for any Taxes imposed on the receipt or ownership of Product at or after the time and place of its Delivery. Each Party will be responsible for the payment of any fees, including attorney and brokers' fees, incurred by it in connection with any Transactions hereunder, unless otherwise agreed by the Parties in the Confirmation.

 2.7 Transfer of Title. None of Seller's property interest in the Product will pass to Buyer until the Delivery and payment set forth in this Article 2 are complete. Upon such completion, all rights, title and interest in and to the Product, to the full extent the same is property, will transfer to Buyer. Subject to any terms agreed by the Parties and set forth in the Confirmation, to the extent that any Transaction is for Product not yet generated at the time of the Transaction, Seller agrees to make and Buyer agrees to accept actual Delivery of the Product, unless sooner netted out pursuant to opposite purchases and sales between the Parties.

 2.8 Effect of Transfer of Environmental Attributes. By transferring a Product in a Transaction, Seller transfers any and all rights to such Product to Buyer, including the exclusive right to use the Product in any Applicable Program, whether or not the Confirmation specifies that the Product is eligible for a particular Applicable Program, and whether or not the particular Product or any Environmental Attribute therein constitutes property, including any and all Product Reporting Rights. For the avoidance of doubt, transfer of a Product (i) does not transfer eligibility for production tax credits or other direct third-party subsidies for generation of electricity by any specified Renewable Energy Facility and (ii) grants Buyer the right, exclusive to the full extent applicable, to Verification, Certification, and otherwise to take advantage of the rights, claims and ownership in the Product.

 2.9 Verifying and Certifying. The type and amount of any Environmental Attribute transferred and Delivered will be measured, calculated, and subject to Verification and Certification as agreed by the Parties or as required pursuant to the Applicable Program. Unless otherwise specified in a Confirmation or the written rules of the Applicable Program specified by the Parties, Seller will ensure that the Certification Authority, Verification Provider and Verification Methodologies are selected in compliance with this Master Agreement and the rules of the Applicable Program. A Verification Provider and Verification Methodology may be designated before or after Delivery, but unless required pursuant to the terms of the Applicable Program specified by the Parties, Verification is optional and need not be specified. Expenses of Verification are the responsibility of the Seller if Verification is designated on or before the Trade Date, and the responsibility of Buyer if designated thereafter. Unless otherwise specified in the Confirmation or the rules of the Applicable Program, the costs of the Verification Authority and Certification Authority are Seller's responsibility.

 2.10 Secondary Markets; Exclusion of Warranties. Unless otherwise specified in a Confirmation, neither Seller nor Buyer will have any liability to the other for any act, omission, misrepresentation, or breach (other than act or omission due to the failure to have fees, charges or expenses paid by the responsible Party) by a Certification Authority or Verification Provider, nor, unless otherwise specified, does Seller or Buyer warrant or represent that any particular Verification Methodology is the optimum way to calculate generation, emissions, avoidances, or other matters calculated or estimated pursuant thereto. To the extent a Product is evidenced or Delivered with a Transfer Certificate or other documents executed by or setting forth the findings of third parties, the sole representations of Seller with respect thereto will be that

 (a) Seller has no actual knowledge that any statement therein is false or intentionally misleading, and

 (b) the documents provided by it are true and correct copies of the documentation it has.

 All representations and warranties made by Seller to Buyer with respect to the Environmental Attributes, Renewable Energy Facility, Renewable Energy Source, energy delivery location, or Vintage of a Product are transferable by Buyer. Any representation of compliance with an Applicable Program applies only up to the Trade Date. If applicable, a Confirmation may provide by its terms that the Renewable Energy Facility will be designated by Seller after the Trade Date and on or before the Delivery Date, so long as once having been specified, the Delivery complies with the requirements of the Applicable Program, in the manner represented by Seller.

 2.11 Scope of Master Agreement. Any transaction for the purchase and sale of Product which has been or will be entered into between the Parties constitutes a Transaction which is subject to, governed by, and construed in accordance with, the terms hereof.

 2.12 Product Quantity. Seller agrees to sell and Buyer agrees to buy a specified volume of the Environmental Attributes generated by the Unit Specific Renewable Energy Facility as identified in the Confirmation.

With respect to each Transaction, Seller represents and warrants to Buyer on the Trade Date for each Product that such Product complies with any Applicable Program for which the Product is specified as so complying in the Confirmation, and on the Delivery Date for each Product that:

 (a) Seller has good and marketable title to such Product;

 (b) Seller has not sold the Product or any Environmental Attribute of the Product to be transferred to Buyer to any other person or entity;

Seller makes no claims respecting Verification that are not set forth in the Confirmation.

 3.3 LIMITATION OF WARRANTIES. ALL OTHER REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES, WRITTEN OR ORAL, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING ANY REPRESENTATION OR WARRANTY OF MERCHANTABILITY OR OF FITNESS FOR ANY PARTICULAR PURPOSE OR WITH RESPECT TO CONFORMITY WITH ANY MODEL OR SAMPLES, ARE DISCLAIMED. WITHOUT LIMITING THE GENERALITY OF THE FOREGOING, NEITHER PARTY MAKES ANY REPRESENTATION OR WARRANTY HEREUNDER WITH RESPECT TO ANY FUTURE ACTION OR FAILURE TO ACT OR APPROVAL OR FAILURE TO APPROVE BY ANY GOVERNMENTAL AUTHORITY OR ADMINISTRATOR.

 3.4 Indemnity. Each Party will indemnify, defend and hold harmless the other Party from and against any claims or demands made by others arising from or out of any event, circumstance, act or incident first occurring or existing during the period when control and title to Product is vested in such Party as provided herein, except to the extent arising from such Party's own gross negligence or willful misconduct. Each Party will indemnify, defend and hold harmless the other Party against any Taxes for which such Party is responsible under Section 2.6.

 3.5 Cooperation on Delivery; Review of Records. Upon either Party's receipt of notice from an Administrator that the transfer of RECs pursuant to a Transaction will not be recognized or Product Delivery was not made as required pursuant to the terms of a Transaction, that Party will immediately so notify the other Party, providing a copy of such notice, and both Parties will cooperate in taking such actions as are necessary and commercially reasonable to cause such transfer to be recognized and Product Delivered. Each Party agrees to provide copies of its records to the extent reasonably necessary for the Verification Provider or Certification Authority to perform the functions designated on the Confirmation, and to verify the accuracy of any fact, statement, charge or computation made pursuant hereto if requested by the other Party. If any fact, statement, charge or computation contained any inaccuracy, the necessary adjustments and any resulting payments will be made promptly and the payments will bear interest at the Prime Rate from the date the overpayment or underpayment was made until paid. If Seller is not the owner or operator of the Renewable Energy Facility that generated all of the Product in a Transaction, Seller will cooperate with Buyer in any efforts to review the records of the original Seller of such Product. If Seller is the owner or operator of the Renewable Energy Facility that generated any portion of the Product in a Transaction, it consents to Buyer's assignment of rights under this Section to any subsequent purchaser of such Product. The obligations set forth in this Section terminate with respect to any particular Transaction on the later of thirty (30) days following the last date for any banking of the RECs under the Applicable Program for the Vintage of the Product Delivered, or the third anniversary of the Delivery Date.

 The Parties further reserve the right to review during normal business hours and at its own expense, for up to two (2) years following the Delivery Date of the WREGIS Certificates, and with reasonable advance notice to the other Party and to the extent that such other Party is in possession of such information:

 (a) The actual hourly MWh generated by the Renewable Energy Facility, and

 (b) Information required to verify that the RECs sold under the Confirmation were not otherwise sold by Seller to a third party.

 3.6 Survival. Articles 1, 2, 3, 5, 8 and 9 survive expiration or termination hereof.

 ARTICLE 4 CREDIT

 4.1 Financial Information. If requested by a Party, the other Party will deliver:

 (a) within 200 days following the end of each fiscal year, a copy of the annual report containing audited consolidated financial statements for such fiscal year of such Party, or if applicable, of the entity specified in Exhibit C,

 (b) within 60 days after the end of each of its first three fiscal quarters of each fiscal year, a copy of the quarterly report containing unaudited consolidated financial statements for such fiscal quarter of such Party, or if applicable, of the entity specified in Exhibit C, and

 (c) such other information as specified in the Confirmation.

 In all cases the statements will be for the most recent accounting period and prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the jurisdiction in which the reporting entity is organized; provided, however, that should any such statements not be available on a timely basis due to a delay in preparation or certification, such delay will not be an Event of Default so long as the relevant entity diligently pursues the preparation, certification and delivery of the statements. If applicable, timely filing of Form 10-K, Form 10- Q or Form 8-K with the Securities and Exchange Commission satisfies the requirements of this Section.

 4.2 Credit Assurances.

 (a) During the Term, if there is any Downgrade Event affecting Buyer or Seller (or Seller's Affiliate), the other Party, in its discretion, may require the Party experiencing the Downgrade Event to provide Credit Support sufficient to assure that the Party experiencing or affected by the Downgrade Event will continue to meet its current contractual obligations under this Master Agreement for the next twelve (12) months from the date of the demand for Credit Support (or if the remaining Term is less than twelve (12) months, for the remaining Term).

 (b) Following a demand for Credit Support and until such time as the Party is no longer experiencing or affected by a Downgrade Event, the Party experiencing or affected by the Downgrade Event shall maintain satisfactory Credit Support on an ongoing, rolling basis sufficient to assure its current contractual obligations and its contractual obligations for the next twelve (12) months. At the request of either Party, Credit Support shall be increased or decreased as appropriate once per calendar month such that the party providing Credit Support will be able to meet the affected Party's then-current contractual obligations and its contractual obligations under this Master Agreement for the next twelve (12) month period (or if the remaining Term is less than twelve (12) months, for the remaining Term).

 (c) In the case of a Downgrade Event being experienced by Seller, such Credit Support will be provided by Seller's Affiliate on behalf of Seller provided that Seller's Affiliate holds a Credit Rating equal to or greater than BBB- from S&P or Baa3 from Moody's. If Seller's Affiliate is experiencing a Downgrade Event, Seller's Credit Support for the above period shall be in an amount sufficient to provide Replacement RECs equal to 5 percent multiplied by 8760 multiplied by the Renewable Energy Facility's Nameplate Capacity (MW) multiplied by the Market REC Price or the applicable penalty pursuant to the Washington RPS, whichever is less. For purposes of this Section 4.2(c), Market REC Price shall be determined by using, in the absence of a liquid, transparent REC market, the average of two broker estimates for the above referenced twelve (12) month period. The brokers are to be chosen by Buyer. In the event a liquid, transparent REC market exists, then the Market REC Price shall be used from the REC market.

 (d) If Buyer is experiencing a Downgrade Event, Buyer's Credit Support for the above period shall be in an amount equal to the greater of (a) two month's of anticipated receivables, or (b) the negative difference between the Market REC Price and the Purchase Price herein multiplied by the RECs that would be delivered for the above referenced twelve (12) month period under this Master Agreement (assuming deliveries of 125 percent of the Guaranteed Minimum Volume applicable to such period). For purposes of this Section 4.2(d), Market REC Price shall be as determined by using, in the absence of a liquid, transparent REC market, the average of two broker estimates for the above referenced twelve (12) month period. The brokers are to be chosen by Seller. In the event a liquid, transparent REC market exists, then the Market REC Price shall be used from the REC market.

 (e) If the Party experiencing a Downgrade Event fails to provide such Credit Support within ten (10) days of a request for Credit Support or fails to maintain Credit Support as set forth above, the requesting Party may suspend its performance under this Master Agreement until such Credit Support is posted or may treat the failure to provide Credit Support as a default and exercise its rights under Article 5 of this Master Agreement.

 (f) At a Party's written request, the other Party shall furnish the requesting Party financial information as may be reasonably required to confirm that a Downgrade Event has not occurred.

 (g) Either Party may assign its Credit Support obligation to a "Guarantor" acceptable to the other Party that will be able to meet the minimum credit standards set forth in the definition of Downgrade Event.

 4.3 Guarantee. If specified in the Confirmation, the Parties will provide, prior to or concurrently with the execution and delivery hereof, a guarantee in an amount not less than the Guarantee Amount specified therein, in a form reasonably acceptable to the beneficiary Party.

 ARTICLE 5 EVENTS OF DEFAULT; REMEDIES

 5.1 Events of Default. An "Event of Default" means, with respect to a Party (a "Defaulting Party"), the occurrence of any of the following:

 (a) the failure to make, when due, any payment required pursuant hereto if such failure is not remedied within three Business Days after receipt of written notice;

 (b) failure to Deliver or receive Product when due pursuant to a Transaction, provided that if the Potentially Defaulting Party pays a Settlement Amount to the Potentially Non- Defaulting Party for such Transaction (or the missing components thereof or performance hereunder if partial performance has been rendered) as if a Terminated Transaction as of the Delivery Date within three Business Days after the Potentially Non-Defaulting Party's written notice to the Potentially Defaulting Party of the amount thereof, it will not be an Event of Default, unless five such failures have occurred in a consecutive rolling ninety (90) day period;

 (c) any representation or warranty made by such Party herein is false or misleading in any material respect when made or repeated;

 (d) if such Party becomes Bankrupt and cannot fulfill its obligations hereunder;

 (e) the failure of such Party to satisfy the creditworthiness and collateral requirements agreed to pursuant to Article 4, if applicable;

 (f) a Party's failure to perform any other material covenant or obligation set forth herein, if such failure is not remedied within 20 Business Days after receipt of written notice;

 (g) with respect to such Party's Guarantor:

 (i) if any representation or warranty made by a Guarantor in connection with this Master Agreement is false or misleading in any material respect when made or when deemed made or repeated;

 (ii) the failure of a Guarantor to make any payment required or to perform any other material covenant or obligation in any guaranty made in connection with this Master Agreement and such failure is not remedied within three Business Days after written notice;

 (iii) if Party's Guarantor becomes Bankrupt and cannot fulfill its obligations hereunder;

 (iv) the failure of a Guarantor's guaranty to be in full force and effect for purposes hereof (other than in accordance with its terms) prior to the satisfaction of all obligations of such Party under each Transaction to which such guaranty relates without the written consent of the other Party; or

 (v) a Guarantor repudiates, disaffirms, disclaims, or rejects or challenges, in whole or in part, the validity of any guaranty; or

 (h) failure by Seller to provide Replacement RECs, if applicable, as may be required in the Confirmation.

 5.2 Declaration of Early Termination and Calculation of Settlement Amounts. If an Event of Default with respect to a Defaulting Party occurs and is continuing, the other Party (the "Non-Defaulting Party") will have the right to:

 (a) designate a day, no earlier than the day such notice is effective and no later than 20 days after such notice is effective, as an early termination date ("Early Termination Date"), to accelerate all amounts owing between the Parties, and to liquidate and terminate all, but not less than all, Transactions (each referred to as a "Terminated Transaction") between the Parties;

 (b) withhold any payments due to the Defaulting Party under this Master Agreement; and

 (c) suspend performance.

 The Non-Defaulting Party will calculate, in a commercially reasonable manner, a Settlement Amount for each such Terminated Transaction as of the Early Termination Date (or, to the extent that, in the reasonable opinion of the Non-Defaulting Party, certain of such Terminated Transactions are commercially impracticable to liquidate and terminate, or may not be liquidated and terminated under Applicable Law on the Early Termination Date, as soon thereafter as is reasonably practicable).

 5.3 Net Out of Settlement Amounts. The Non-Defaulting Party will aggregate all Settlement Amounts under this Master Agreement into a single amount by netting out (a) all amounts that are due to the Defaulting Party, plus, at the option of the Non-Defaulting Party, any cash, security or other Performance Assurance then available to the Non-Defaulting Party, plus any or all other amounts due to the Defaulting Party under this Master Agreement against (b) all Settlement Amounts that are due to the Non-Defaulting Party, plus any or all other amounts due to the Non-Defaulting Party under this Master Agreement, so that all such amounts will be netted out to a single liquidated amount (the "Termination Payment") payable by the Defaulting Party. The Termination Payment, if any, is due from the Defaulting Party to the Non-Defaulting Party within ten (10) Business Days following notice.

 5.4 Calculation Disputes. If the Defaulting Party disputes the Non-Defaulting Party's calculation of the Settlement Amount or Termination Payment, in whole or in part, the Defaulting Party will, within ten (10) Business Days of receipt of Non-Defaulting Party's calculation, provide to the Non-Defaulting Party a detailed written explanation of the basis for such dispute; provided, however, that the Defaulting Party must first transfer Performance Assurance to the Non-Defaulting Party in an amount equal to the full Settlement Amount or Termination Payment, as applicable. References to Defaulting Party and Non-Defaulting Party in this Section include the Potentially Defaulting Party and Potentially Non-Defaulting Party, as applicable.

 5.5 Suspension of Performance. Notwithstanding any other provision hereof, if an Event of Default or a Potential Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, the Non- Defaulting Party, upon written notice to the Defaulting Party, has the right (i) to suspend performance under any or all Transactions and (ii) to the extent an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, to exercise any remedy available at law or in equity, except as limited by Section 5.7.

 5.6 Not a Penalty. The Parties intend that no part of this Article 5 or any amount due thereunder represents a penalty to the Defaulting Party or Potentially Defaulting Party.

 5.7 Limitation of Liability. IN NO EVENT WILL EITHER PARTY BE LIABILE TO THE OTHER FOR PUNITIVE, EXEMPLARY, OR INDIRECT DAMAGES, LOST PROFIT OR BUSINESS INTERRUPTION DAMAGES, BY STATUTE, IN TORT, CONTRACT OR OTHERWISE, AND, EXCEPT FOR FAILURE TO DELIVER PRODUCTS PROMISED AS SPECIFICALLY SET FORTH HEREIN, NO PARTY WILL BE REQUIRED TO PAY OR BE LIABLE FOR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES.

 ARTICLE 6 FORCE MAJEURE

 If either Party is rendered unable, wholly or in part, by Force Majeure to carry out its obligations with respect to this Master Agreement, that upon such Party's (the "Claiming Party") giving notice and full particulars of such Force Majeure as soon as reasonably possible after the occurrence of the cause relied upon, confirmed in writing, the obligations of the Claiming Party will, to the extent they are affected by such Force Majeure, be suspended during the continuance of said inability, but for no longer period, and the Claiming Party will not be in breach hereof or liable to the other Party for, or on account of, any loss, damage, injury or expense resulting from, or arising out of such event of Force Majeure. The Party receiving such notice of Force Majeure will have five (5) Business Days following such receipt to notify the Claiming Party that it objects to or disputes the existence of Force Majeure. "Force Majeure" means an event or circumstance which materially adversely affects the ability of a Party to perform its obligations under one or more Transactions, which event or circumstance was not reasonably anticipated as of the date such Transaction was entered into and which is not within the reasonable control of, or the result of the negligence of, the Claiming Party, and which the Claiming Party is unable to overcome or avoid or cause to be avoided, by the exercise of due diligence. Force Majeure includes events or circumstances described in the previous sentence that disrupt the operation of the specified Renewable Energy Facility. Force Majeure may not be based on (i) the loss or failure of Buyer's markets; (ii) Buyer's inability economically to use or resell the Product purchased hereunder; or (iii) Seller's ability to sell the Product to another at a price greater than the Purchase Price. Force Majeure may include a change in Applicable Law, or the failure or disruption in Deliveries of any Certification  Authority that is not the Claiming Party. In the case of a Party's obligation to make payments hereunder, Force Majeure will be only an event or act of a Governmental Authority that on any day disables the banking system through which a Party makes such payments.

 ARTICLE 7 GOVERNMENT ACTION

 The Parties acknowledge that the Applicable Programs, which among other things establish the conditions for a market for certain Products, may be the subject of Government Action (including court challenge) that could adversely affect the eligibility of a Product to meet the requirements of an Applicable Program or otherwise alter the requirements of the Applicable Program, or make a Product unavailable or dramatically diminished or increased in value. With respect to any Transaction, as of the Trade Date Seller represents and warrants that the Product complies with the requirements of the Applicable Program. Subsequent to the Trade Date, Buyer bears the risk of any changes to any Applicable Program. With respect to any Transaction, if Seller represents that a Product complies with an Applicable Program, such representation is made and effective as of the Trade Date, and Seller will not be in breach of such representation on account of any Government Action occurring after the Trade Date. Unless otherwise specifically stated in a particular Confirmation, Government Action that changes in any respect the value of a Product, including a Cancellation of Applicable Program, will have no effect on the obligation of the Parties to purchase and sell such Product at the price and on the terms set forth in the Confirmation. To the extent that Government Action renders Delivery illegal under Applicable Law, such Transaction will be terminated and that portion of Products that have been paid for but not yet Delivered will be refunded by Seller, to the extent it is lawful to do so. Notwithstanding the foregoing, no Transaction will be affected, cancelled, or otherwise impaired by Government Action that is specific to a Party under Applicable Law taken by a Governmental Authority alleging that Party's violation thereof.

 ARTICLE 8 GOVERNING LAW; STATUTE OF FRAUDS

 This Master Agreement is governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of Washington. Washington State law may not provide exemptions from the Statute of Frauds similar to those provided under the laws of New York and California, and that therefore in order for such Transaction to be enforceable, the Parties may need to put Transactions that will not be fully performed by a year from the Trade Date, or above a certain dollar amount, in a writing signed by both Parties.

 ARTICLE 9 MISCELLANEOUS

 9.1 Term of Master Agreement. Unless otherwise agreed to in the Confirmation, the term hereof commences on the Effective Date and remains in effect until terminated by either Party upon 30 days' prior written notice; provided, however, that such termination will not affect any Transaction entered into and not yet fully, faithfully, and indefeasibly performed as of such termination, or excuse the performance of either Party under any provision hereof that by its terms survives any such termination and, provided further, that this Master Agreement and any other documents executed and delivered hereunder will remain in effect with respect to the Transactions entered into prior to the effective date of such termination until both Parties have fulfilled all of their obligations with respect to such Transactions if such Transactions have not been terminated under Article 5 or 7.

 9.2 Assignment. Neither Party may assign this Master Agreement or any Transaction without the prior written consent of the other, which consent will not be unreasonably withheld; provided, however, either Party may, without the consent of the other,

 (a) transfer, sell, pledge, encumber or assign this Master Agreement or the accounts, revenues or proceeds hereof in connection with any financing or other financial arrangements (and without relieving itself from liability hereunder),

 (b) transfer or assign this Master Agreement to an Affiliate of such Party which Affiliate's creditworthiness is equal to or higher than that of such Party on the Effective Date, or

 (c) transfer or assign this Master Agreement to any person or entity succeeding to all or substantially all of the assets whose creditworthiness is equal to or higher than that of such Party on the Effective Date; provided, however, that in each such case, any such assignee must agree in writing to be bound by the terms and conditions hereof and so long as the transferring Party must deliver such tax and enforceability assurance as the non-transferring Party may reasonably request. This Master Agreement will bind each Party's successors and permitted assigns. Any attempted assignment in violation of this provision will be void ab initio.

 9.3 Notices. All notices, requests, statements or payments will be made as specified in Exhibit C. Notices, unless otherwise specified herein, must be in writing and delivered by hand delivery, United States mail, overnight courier service, e-mail or facsimile. Notice by facsimile or hand delivery is effective when actually received, if received before or during business hours on a Business Day, and otherwise will be effective on the next Business Day. Notice by overnight United States mail or courier will be effective on the next Business Day after it was sent. Notice by e-mail will be effective on return confirmation e-mail from the receiver. A Party may change its addresses by providing notice of same in accordance herewith.

 9.4 Day Conventions. Unless otherwise specifically provided herein or in a Confirmation, (i) "day" means a calendar day and includes Saturdays, Sundays and holidays, and (ii) if a payment falls due on a day that is not a Business Day, the payment will be due on the next Business Day thereafter.

 9.5 General.

 (a) This Master Agreement constitutes the entire agreement between the Parties relating to its subject matter. Any prior agreement or negotiation between the Parties with respect to the subject hereof is superseded. Any Confirmation or any collateral, credit support or margin agreement or similar arrangement between the Parties will, upon designation by the Parties, be deemed part hereof and incorporated herein by reference, with this Master Agreement controlling in the event of a contradiction, unless otherwise agreed by the Parties in writing.

 (b) This Master Agreement will be considered for all purposes as prepared through the joint efforts of the Parties and not be construed against one Party or the other as a result of the preparation, substitution, organizational membership, submission or other event of negotiation, drafting or execution hereof.

 (c) The parties may agree to amend this Master Agreement, but no amendment or modification hereto, or to any written Confirmation, shall be enforceable unless in writing and executed by both Parties.

 (d) Headings used herein are for convenience and reference purposes only.

 (e) Nothing herein constitutes any Party a partner, agent or legal representative of the other Party or creates any fiduciary relationship between them.

 (f) The waiver by either Party of a default or a breach by the other Party will not operate or be construed to operate as a waiver of any subsequent default or breach. The making or the acceptance of a payment by either Party with knowledge of the existence of a default or breach will not operate as a waiver of any default or breach.

 (g) Except as provided in a Confirmation or pursuant to Article 7, if any provision hereof is, for any reason, determined to be invalid, illegal, or unenforceable in any respect, the Parties will negotiate in good faith and agree to such amendments, modifications, or supplements of or to this Master Agreement or such other appropriate actions that will, to the maximum extent practicable in light of such determination, implement and give effect to the intentions of the Parties as reflected herein, and the other provisions hereof will, as so amended, modified, or supplemented, or otherwise affected by such action, remain in full force and effect.

 (h) This Master Agreement may be executed in counterparts, each of which will be deemed an original but all of which taken together will constitute one and the same original instrument.

 9.6 Electronic Documents. Any document generated by the Parties with respect to this Master Agreement, including this Master Agreement, may be imaged and stored electronically and introduced as evidence in any proceeding as if original business records. Neither Party will object to the admissibility of such images as evidence in any proceeding on account of having been stored electronically.

 9.7 Dispute Resolution. Prior to initiating any lawsuit or legal action, each Party agrees to follow and implement in good faith, the following dispute resolution processes.

 (a) Negotiations. The Parties must attempt in good faith to resolve all disputes arising out of, related to or in connection with this Master Agreement promptly by negotiation, as follows. Any Party may give the other Party written notice of any dispute ("Dispute Notice") not resolved in the normal course of business. Executives of both Parties at levels one level above the personnel who have previously been involved in the dispute must meet at a mutually acceptable time and place within ten days after delivery of such notice, and thereafter as often as they reasonably deem necessary, to exchange relevant information and to attempt to resolve the dispute. If the matter has not been resolved within thirty (30) days after the referral of the dispute to such senior executives, or if no meeting of such senior executives has taken place within fifteen (15) days after such referral, either Party may initiate a dispute resolution method as provided hereinafter if neither Party has requested that the dispute be mediated in accordance with Section (b) below. All negotiations pursuant to this clause are confidential.

 (b) Mediation. If the dispute is not resolved within thirty (30) days after the referral of the dispute to senior executives, or if no meeting of senior executives has taken place within fifteen (15) days after such referral, either Party may request that the matter be submitted to nonbinding mediation. If the other Party agrees, the mediation will be conducted in accordance with the Commercial Arbitration Rules and Mediation Procedures (Including Procedures for Large, Complex Commercial Disputes) of the American Arbitration Association (the "AAA"), as amended and effective on July 1, 2003 (the "AAA Rules"), notwithstanding any dollar amounts or dollar limitations contained therein.

 (i) The Party requesting the mediation, may commence the mediation process with AAA by notifying AAA and the other Party in writing ("Mediation Notice") of such Party's desire that the dispute be resolved through mediation, including therewith a copy of the Dispute Notice and the response thereto, if any, and a copy of the other Party's written agreement to such mediation.

 (ii) The mediation will be conducted in King County, Washington by a single mediator. The Parties may select any mutually acceptable mediator. If the Parties cannot agree on a mediator within five days after the date of the Mediation Notice, then the AAA's Administrator will send a list and resumes of three available mediators to the Parties, each of whom will strike one name, and the remaining person will be appointed as the mediator. If more than one name remains, either because one or both Parties have failed to respond to the AAA's Administrator within five days after receiving the list or because one or both Parties have failed to strike a name from the list or because both Parties strike the same name, the AAA's Administrator will choose the mediator from the remaining names within five days. If the designated mediator dies, becomes incapable, unwilling, or unable to serve or proceed with the mediation, a substitute mediator will be appointed in accordance with the selection procedure described above, and such substitute mediator will have all such powers as if he or she has been originally appointed herein.

 (iii) The mediation will consist of one or more informal, nonbinding meetings between the Parties and the mediator, jointly and in separate caucuses, out of which the mediator will seek to guide the Parties to a resolution of the Dispute. The mediation process will continue until the resolution of the dispute, or the termination of the mediation process pursuant to this Section. The costs of the mediation, including fees and expenses, will be borne equally by the Parties.

 (iv) All verbal and written communications between the Parties that are issued or prepared in connection with this Section will be deemed prepared and communicated in furtherance, and in the context, of dispute settlement, and will be exempt from discovery and production, and will not be admissible in evidence (whether as admission or otherwise) in any litigation or other proceedings for the resolution of the dispute.

 (v) The initial mediation conference between the Parties and the mediator, which may be held by telephone, will be held within twenty-five (25) days after the Mediation Notice. Either Party may terminate the mediation process upon or after the earlier to occur of (A) the failure of the initial mediation conference to occur within twenty-five (25) days after the date of the Mediation Notice, (B) the passage of forty-five (45) days after the date of the Mediation Notice without the dispute having been resolved, or (C) such time as the mediator makes a finding that there is no possibility of resolution through mediation.

 (vi) All deadlines in this Section may be extended by mutual agreement.

 (c) Settlement Discussions. No statements of position or offers of settlement made in the course of the dispute process described in this Section will be offered into evidence for any purpose in any litigation between the Parties, nor will any such statements or offers of settlement constitute an admission or waiver of rights by either Party in connection with any such litigation. At the request of either Party, any such statements and offers of settlement, and all copies thereof, will be promptly returned to the Party providing the same.

 9.8 Jurisdiction and Venue. Any disputes arising out of, in connection with or with respect to this Master Agreement, the subject matter of this Master Agreement, the performance or non-performance of any obligation under this Master Agreement that cannot be resolved in accordance with Section 9.7 shall be adjudicated in King County

 Superior Court, King County, Washington and nowhere else. Each of the Parties irrevocably consents to the jurisdiction of such Court.

 IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the Parties have caused this Master Agreement to be executed by their duly authorized representatives as of the Effective Date.
