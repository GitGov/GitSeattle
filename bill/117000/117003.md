 ORDINANCE _________________

 AN ORDINANCE relating to taxicabs; reducing the annual Seattle for-hire driver license regulatory fee, eliminating the fee exemption applicable to Seattle for-hire driver licensees with King County endorsements and amending subsection 6.310.150.C of the Seattle Municipal Code.

 WHEREAS, an increase in regulatory fee revenue is necessary to recover the full cost of the taxicab and for-hire vehicle regulatory program; and

 WHEREAS, the $75 annual Seattle for-hire driver license regulatory fee contained in Section 6.310.150 of the Seattle Municipal Code has not been collected from licensees holding Seattle for-hire driver licenses with King County endorsements since a fee exemption was adopted by Ordinance 119872 in 2000; and

 WHEREAS, this ordinance proposes to reduce the $75 annual Seattle for-hire driver license regulatory fee to $50 and eliminate the fee exemption applicable to Seattle for-hire driver licensees with King County endorsements; and

 WHEREAS, it is considered a matter of equity that all for-hire drivers, whether they hold a King County endorsement or not, pay the same annual Seattle for-hire driver license regulatory fee and that both for-hire drivers and vehicle licensees pay fees to help recover their share of the costs of the taxicab and for-hire vehicle regulatory program; and

 WHEREAS, the proposed changes result in an additional $100,000 per year in fees collected to support the full cost of the taxicab and for-hire vehicle regulatory program; NOW, THEREFORE,

 BE IT ORDAINED BY THE CITY OF SEATTLE AS FOLLOWS:

 Section 1. Effective January 1, 2011, subsection 6.310.150.C of the Seattle Municipal Code, as last amended by Ordinance 122763, is amended as follows:

 C. For-hire driver license:

 Annual fee $((~~75* * * *~~)) 50

 Add/change affiliation* * * $20

 Late fee $15

 ID photo $5

 Fingerprinting Charge as determined by Director to cover costs

 Replacement license $5

 Training class fee As determined by Director

 * * * For-hire drivers may only be affiliated with a maximum of three ((~~(3)~~)) taxicab associations at any given time. This fee is only charged when the driver is affiliated with three ((~~(3)~~)) associations and now wants to delete one ((~~(1)~~)) association and add another.

 ((~~* * * * If a for-hire driver has a King County license, no additional fee is charged for a Seattle for-hire driver license. An endorsement will be added to the King County for-hire driver license stating that the license is valid for Seattle also. The driver must still meet all Seattle for-hire driver requirements and obtain a City of Seattle business license.~~))

 Section 2. This ordinance shall take effect and be in force 30 days from and after its approval by the Mayor, but if not approved and returned by the Mayor within ten days after presentation, it shall take effect as provided by Seattle Municipal Code Section 1.04.020.

 Passed by the City Council the ____ day of ________________________, 2010, and signed by me in open session in authentication of its passage this

 _____ day of ___________________, 2010.
