 Attachment A -- INTERLOCAL AGREEMENT by and between the City of Seattle and King County

 INTERLOCAL AGREEMENT

 by and between

 The City of Seattle

 and

 King County

 This Interlocal Agreement ("Agreement") reflects the understanding of the City of Seattle ("City"), and King County ("County"), (jointly referred to as "Parties") regarding modifications to the Parties' August 20, 2007 Interlocal Agreement concerning Seattle Streetcar Operations and Maintenance ("August 2007 Agreement").

 RECITALS

 Whereas, subsequent to the Seattle Streetcar ("Streetcar") becoming operational a need has arisen to clarify the respective duties of various local law enforcement agencies with regard to the Streetcar;

 Whereas, it is the parties' intent to modify the August 2007 Agreement concerning Streetcar operations, as set forth below;

 Whereas, RCW 10.93.130 permits law enforcement agencies to agree by interlocal agreements to enforce each other's laws;

 NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the mutual terms and obligations contained herein and in the August 2007 Agreement, the Parties agree as follows:

 1) The Seattle Police Department shall be the primary law enforcement agency (as that term is commonly understood in the Seattle policing community) charged with providing public safety services that arise in the operation of the Streetcar. Such responsibilities shall include, but not be limited to, serving as the primary law enforcement agency in accident investigation, responding to calls for law enforcement, and providing security services. Nothing in this paragraph shall preclude the Seattle Police Department from seeking assistance from the King County Sheriff's Office pursuant to the parties' mutual aid agreement.

 2) King County will apply its code of conduct on the Streetcar and Streetcar stations pursuant to Ch. 28.96 KCC and its implementing administrative policies and procedures. The Seattle Police Department will have primary enforcement of this code of conduct.

 3) Sections 10 and 11 of Interlocal Agreement 15860, dated June 12, 2007, are superseded by the agreement of the parties to the extent that they conflict with the provisions set forth above.

 IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the parties hereto have executed this Agreement as of the day and year set forth below their signatures.

 King County City of Seattle
