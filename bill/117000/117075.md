 ORDINANCE _________________

 AN ORDINANCE vacating the following portions of streets, alleys, and blocks: SW Morgan Street between 15th Avenue SW and Burien Way SW; 12th Avenue SW, 13th Avenue SW, and 14th Avenue SW between SW Morgan Street and SW Holly Street; 11th Place SW between SW Morgan Street and SW Warsaw Street; 11th Avenue SW between SW Morgan Street and 10th Avenue SW; 10th Avenue SW between SW Morgan Street and SW Warsaw Street; SW Warsaw Street between 11th Place SW and 10th Avenue SW; SW Holly Street between 12th Avenue SW and W Marginal Way SW; the alley between 12th Avenue SW and Burien Way SW, north of SW Holly Street; Burien Way SW between the projected north margin of SW Morgan Street from the west to the northern margin of SW Holly Street, as vacated by Ordinance 93969, excepting the northern approximately 50' of Burien Way SW east of its centerline; approximately 350 feet of 9th Avenue SW from the north margin of SW Holly Street; approximately 340 feet of 8th Avenue SW from the north margin of SW Holly Street; approximately 350 feet of 7th Avenue SW from the north margin of SW Holly Street; Sound Way SW between SW Holly Street and Highland Park Way SW; all of Blocks 1, 2, and 3 in Ewald's 1st Addition to the City of Seattle; and all of Blocks 6, 7, 8, and 9 and a portion of Block 5 in Melville-Barth Addition to the City of Seattle, together known as the Sound Way properties in the Riverview neighborhood of West Seattle (the "Sound Way Property"), on the petition of the Seattle Department of Parks and Recreation ("Parks"); ratifying and confirming an easement; and approving a memorandum of understanding for utility purposes related herein (Clerk File 309972).

 WHEREAS, Parks has filed a petition to vacate the Sound Way Property consisting of streets, alleys, and blocks in and near Blocks 1, 2, and 3 of Ewald's 1st Addition to the City of Seattle and Blocks 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9 in Melville- Barth Addition to the City of Seattle; and

 WHEREAS, in the 1950's and 1960's the City of Seattle purchased and laid off as right-of-way two groups of vacant properties for transportation projects, collectively known as the Sound Way project, which proved infeasible and was subsequently cancelled; and

 WHEREAS, no further plans for transportation purposes were made by the City of Seattle for the Sound Way Property; and

 WHEREAS, in 2003 the Fleets and Facilities Department analyzed options for the use of the property; and

 WHEREAS, vacating the rights-of-way and incorporating the property into the greenbelt system will connect and consolidate City ownership of the greenbelt under one department which will allow for consistent management and the ability of the City to apply for available state grants for open space preservation; and

 WHEREAS, once completed the vacation will add approximately 32 acres of permanent open space to the West Duwamish Greenbelt, the City's largest greenspace at over 375 acres, and make whole an otherwise segmented West Duwamish Greenbelt; and

 WHEREAS, following a public hearing on the petition, held on August 4, 2009, the petition was conditionally granted; and

 WHEREAS, Ordinance 121661 provides that City Departments are exempt from the payment of vacation fees, therefore no fee was required; and

 WHEREAS, the Seattle City Council ("City Council") has conditionally approved the petition contingent upon resolving all utility issues, including but not limited to, the petitioner granting a no-cost permanent easement to the King County Wastewater Treatment Division with respect to its existing wastewater pipeline currently located within a portion of the Sound Way Property proposed for vacation and a Memorandum of Understanding between Parks and Seattle City Light to operate and maintain an existing electrical system within a portion of the vacated Sound Way Property; and

 WHEREAS, Parks has committed to working cooperatively with Seattle Public Utilities to address any future drainage system changes; and

 WHEREAS, the petitioner has now met all conditions imposed by City Council in connection with this vacation petition; and

 WHEREAS, vacating the Sound Way Property that currently runs through the middle of the West Duwamish Greenbelt will help preserve areas of natural landscape and habitat for wildlife and is therefore in the best interest of the public; NOW, THEREFORE,
