 AN ORDINANCE related to parking rates; amending Section 11.16.121 of the Seattle Municipal Code to set new limits on parking rates at parking payment devices and to establish new policy objectives for setting parking rates.

 WHEREAS, the City's Comprehensive Plan recognizes the importance of paid on-street parking to encourage parking turnover, customer access, and efficient allocation of parking among a diverse group of users; and

 WHEREAS, through managing demand and improving compliance, good parking management provides reliable customer access by ensuring parking is well utilized but that some spaces are available; and

 WHEREAS, moving on-street parking rates closer to off-street garage and lot rates reduces congestion and pollution from excessive circling; and

 WHEREAS, good parking management supports economic vitality, neighborhood livability, and encourages alternate travel modes for commuters, helping to reduce carbon emissions; and

 WHEREAS, in 2004, the Seattle Department of Transportation (SDOT) began to replace single-space parking meters with parking pay stations to provide improved parking management, revenue benefits, and customer service and streetscape enhancements; and

 WHEREAS, by the end of 2009, SDOT had installed more than 2,100 pay station kiosks and now controls about 13,500 paid parking spaces; and
