 AN ORDINANCE relating to land use and zoning; amending Sections 23.43.040, 23.50.012, and 23.84A.038 of the Seattle Municipal Code; and adding new Sections 23.42.054, 23.44.053, 23.45.595, and 23.47A.036; to permit transitional encampments for homeless individuals as a use accessory to religious facilities in all zones.

 WHEREAS, there is a well-documented history of homelessness in Seattle and a demonstrated need for additional facilities to address the issue; and

 WHEREAS, faith-based communities have proven effective in providing shelter and support for homeless persons, including providing space on their property for transitional encampments that do not include permanent structures; and

 WHEREAS, faith-based communities have made support of homeless persons an integral part of their religious mission, and their transitional encampment activity is incidental to their religious facilities; and

 WHEREAS, transitional encampments may currently be allowed as a temporary use, in any zone, without specific health and safety standards in the Seattle Land Use Code; and

 WHEREAS, this ordinance does not change the current code provision that allows entities, including secular entities, to continue to host transitional encampments after obtaining a temporary use permit according to existing procedures in the Seattle Land Use Code; and

 WHEREAS, RCW 35.21.915, permits cities regulating homeless encampments on property owned or controlled by a religious organization to impose conditions necessary to protect the health and safety of the public; and

 WHEREAS, adding specific transitional encampment health and safety standards to the Code, including limits to numbers of occupants and provisions for cooking and utilities, provides clear guidance to religious facilities and protects the health and safety of the public; and
