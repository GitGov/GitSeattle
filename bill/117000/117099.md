 AN ORDINANCE relating to the City's solid waste system; providing for the issuance of a temporary license and establishing a time frame for action on yellow pages phone book distributor license applications; removing the component of the recovery fee for yellow pages phone books associated with the cost of collecting and recycling yellow pages phone books; and amending Seattle Municipal Code Sections 6.202.280, 6.255.050 and 6.255.100.

 NOW, THEREFORE,

 BE IT ORDAINED BY THE CITY OF SEATTLE AS FOLLOWS:

 Section 1. Section 6.202.280 of the Seattle Municipal Code is amended to read as follows:

 6.202.280 Continuation of business while complaint hearing decision pending.

 A. Except in the case of summary suspension or revocation, whenever a timely request for hearing on a complaint is filed, a licensee or an applicant for license renewal may engage in the activity for which the license is required, pending decision by the Hearing Examiner. An applicant not licensed in the preceding license year may not engage in the activity for which the license is required pending decision by the Hearing Examiner.

 B. If the Department denies an adult entertainment license governed by SMC Chapter 6.270  or a yellow pages phone book distributor license governed by SMC Chapter 6.255 , and if the license applicant files a notice of appeal with the Hearing Examiner, the Director shall immediately issue the license applicant a temporary license. The temporary license shall authorize the license applicant to operate an adult entertainment establishment or perform as a manager or entertainer  or engage in the business of arranging for the distribution of yellow pages phone books , in the same manner as if the license had been granted, pending the Hearing Examiner's decision.

 1. If the Hearing Examiner affirms the Director's license denial, the temporary license shall remain in effect pending a motion for reconsideration before the Hearing Examiner and, in addition (a) if the license applicant does not timely file for judicial review, then only until the expiration of the time allowed to file an application for a writ of review under Chapter 7.16 RCW; or (b) if the license applicant does timely file an application for a writ of review, then only until the court either issues a writ or denies the writ application.

 2. If the Hearing Examiner dismisses the adult entertainment  or the yellow pages phone book distributor  license denial with prejudice, the Department shall immediately issue  the appropriate  ((~~an adult entertainment~~)) license.

 3. If the Hearing Examiner dismisses the adult entertainment  or the yellow pages phone book distributor license  denial without prejudice, the temporary license shall remain in effect for five (5) additional business days, at the end of which time the Department must either reissue a denial or issue  the appropriate  ((~~an adult entertainment~~)) license. If the Director reissues the denial, then the temporary license will continue in effect according to the procedures set forth in subsection B of this section.

 4. Notwithstanding SMC Section 6.202.210, if a license applicant is issued a temporary license, the license applicant shall pay the fee charged for an adult entertainment license under SMC Section 6.270.060  or the fee charged for a yellow pages phone book distributor license under SMC Section 6.255.060  at the time the applicant receives the temporary license. If the temporary license issued under this subsection is still in effect at the end of a calendar year, then the license applicant must pay the fee charged for an adult entertainment license under SMC Section 6.270.060  or the fee charged for a yellow pages phone book distributor license under SMC Section 6.255.060  for the next calendar year.

 Section 2. Section 6.255.050 of the Seattle Municipal Code is amended to read as follows:

 6.255.050 License -- Application.

 Application for the yellow pages phone book distributor license shall be on forms specified by the Director, and shall be accompanied by the license fee established by section 6.255.060, the annual report form required by section 6.255.080, and any recovery fees required by section 6.255.100.  Within 20 days of receipt by the Director of a complete application for a yellow pages phone book distributor license, the Director shall issue or deny the license. If the Director fails to issue or deny the license within the 20 day period, the license is deemed issued on the last day of the 20 day period.

 Section 3. Section 6.255.100 of the Seattle Municipal Code is amended to read as follows:

 6.255.100 Recovery Fee.

 A. A recovery fee is hereby imposed on the distribution of yellow pages phone books within the City to be calculated as follows: Fourteen Cents ($0.14) for each yellow pages phone book distributed within the City((~~plus One Hundred Forty-Eight Dollars ($148.00) per ton of yellow pages phone books distributed within the City~~)). The recovery fee is intended to reflect the cost to the City of administering the Opt-Out Registry((~~and collecting and recycling yellow pages phone books~~)). The Director of Seattle Public Utilities may recommend adjustments to the recovery fee as part of the development of adjustments to the solid waste rates.

 B. Annually and as otherwise may be required by the Director, based on the quantities reported under section 6.255.080, distributors shall report and remit payment of the recovery fees imposed under this section to the Director. Payments shall be reported on forms prescribed by the Director. The form shall be signed by a responsible officer or agent of the distributor. The individual signing the form shall swear or affirm that the information in the form is true and correct.

 C. City revenue generated from the recovery fee imposed under this section shall be deposited in the Solid Waste Fund.

 Section 4. This ordinance shall take effect and be in force 30 days from and after its approval by the Mayor, but if not approved and returned by the Mayor within ten days after presentation, it shall take effect as provided by Seattle Municipal Code Section 1.04.020.
