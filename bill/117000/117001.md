 WHEREAS, through Ordinance 122737, the Seattle City Council placed the question of whether to levy up to $73 million in additional property taxes over six years to pay for and finance basic infrastructure improvements at the Pike Place Market on the November 4, 2008, ballot as Proposition 1, and this proposition subsequently passed with more than 60 percent voter approval; and

 WHEREAS, as part of the 2011 - 2012 budget, the City has proposed borrowing up to $11 million of limited tax general obligation bonds in 2011 to meet the PDA's cash flow needs, and these funds will not be available until the City undertakes its annual borrowing in March or April 2011; and
