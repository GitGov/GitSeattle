 AN ORDINANCE relating to drainage and wastewater services of Seattle Public Utilities; adjusting wastewater and drainage rates to pass through increased treatment costs charged by King County; amending Sections 21.28.040 and 21.33.030 of the Seattle Municipal Code to reflect the adjusted rates; and amending Section 21.76.040 of the Seattle Municipal Code to adjust credits to low-income drainage and wastewater customers.

 WHEREAS, Seattle Public Utilities' wastewater and drainage rates are based on the sum of the treatment rate and system rate for each utility and are designed to pass through the wastewater and drainage shares of the rates King County charges for its wastewater treatment services as part of the treatment rate applicable to each utility; and

 WHEREAS, Ordinances introduced as Council Bill Nos. 116926 and 116928 and adopted November 2010, established the 2011-2012 Seattle Public Utilities' wastewater volume rate and drainage rates, respectively, based on the existing King County wastewater treatment charge of $31.90; and

 WHEREAS, King County adopted a new wastewater treatment rate of $36.10 per residential customer equivalent per month effective January 1, 2011, which is an increase of more than 10 percent over the existing treatment rate; and

 WHEREAS, Subsections 21.28.040 B.1 and 21.33.030 D.1 allow the treatment rates of each utility to be adjusted by ordinance at any time in response to changes in the King County wastewater rates; and

 WHEREAS, the recently adopted Seattle Public Utilities' 2011 and 2012 wastewater and drainage treatment rates will not provide sufficient revenues to pay the increased King County treatment costs; and

 WHEREAS, wastewater and drainage credits for qualified low- income customers, not billed directly by SPU, are based on typical residential bills, and credits for such customers need to be revised to reflect the changes in the wastewater and drainage rates; NOW, THEREFORE,

 BE IT ORDAINED BY THE CITY OF SEATTLE AS FOLLOWS:
