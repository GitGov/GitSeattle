 WHEREAS, state law strictly enhances the penalties for violations of the Controlled Substances Act for violations within 1,000 feet of a school; and

 WHEREAS, in 1998 the State of Washington approved the medical use of cannabis by patients with certain medical conditions and now several other states allow for the medical use of cannabis; and

 WHEREAS, Washington law also permits patients to grow medical cannabis for their own use or to designate a provider to grow medical cannabis for them; and

 WHEREAS, in 2011 the Washington State Legislature passed ESSSB5073 which permits collective gardens by qualified patients and/or their designated providers whereby they may, consistent with state law, collectively grow cannabis for their own medical use; and

 WHEREAS, the City of Seattle believes that the medical use of cannabis should be conducted in a safe and fair manner for the health, safety and welfare of the community; and
