 A.  Legal Description . Pier 56 is located on the property legally described as:

 Lots 1-8, except the south 10 feet of said Lot 8, all in Block 181 of Seattle Tide Lands, according to the map thereof filed in the Office of the Commissioner of Public Lands at Olympia, Washington; Situate in the City of Seattle, County of King, State of Washington.

The existing parking area at the west end of Pier 56 and the accessory docking facilities and associated building (known as Pier 55 1/2) on the north and west side of Pier 55 that lie within the site as described in Section 1.A. are excluded from the designation.

 C.  Basis of Designation . The designation was made because Pier 56 is more than 25 years old and has significant character, interest or value as a part of the development, heritage or cultural characteristics of the City, state or nation, it has integrity or the ability to convey its significance, and because it satisfies the following from SMC 25.12.350:

 2. It embodies the distinctive visible characteristics of an architectural style, period, or of a method of construction (SMC 25.12.350.D); and

 3. Because of its prominence of spatial location, contrast of siting, age, or scale, it is an easily identifiable visual feature of the neighborhood or the city and contributes to the distinctive quality or identity of such neighborhood or city (SMC 25.12.350.F).

 Section 2.  CONTROLS:  The following controls are hereby imposed on the features and characteristics of Pier 56 that were designated by the Board for preservation:

 A.  Certificate of Approval Process.

 1. Except as provided in Section 2.A.2 or Section 2.B of this ordinance, the owner must obtain a Certificate of Approval issued by the Board pursuant to SMC Chapter 25.12 and the Central Waterfront Piers Design Guidelines (LPB 176/08), or the time for denying a Certificate of Approval must have expired, before the owner may make alterations or significant changes to the following specific features or characteristics: the pier pilings from the west edge of the right-of-way of Alaskan Way (the seawall) to the outer harbor line, and from the north edge of the pier pilings to the south edge of the pilings; the exterior pier shed; and the exposed interior truss system as it existed at the time of designation. The existing parking area at the west end of Pier 56 and the accessory docking facilities and associated building (known as Pier 55 1/2) on the north and west side of Pier 55 that lie within the site as described in Section 1.A. are excluded from the designation.

 2. No Certificate of Approval or approval by the CHPO is required for the following:

 a. Any in-kind maintenance or repairs of the features listed in Section 2.A.1.

 b. The removal and/or addition of the following landscape elements: small trees under 6 inches in caliper, shrubs, perennials and annuals.

 c. The addition of safety and security lighting and cameras on the south, north, east, and west elevations of the pier.

 d. The addition of street furniture, umbrellas, vendor carts, tents for temporary events and bicycle racks that are not permanently affixed to the designated features.

 B.  CHPO Approval Process.

 1. The CHPO may review and approve the items listed in Section 2.B.3 of this ordinance according to the following procedure:

 a. The owner shall submit to the CHPO a written request for the alterations, including applicable drawings and/or specifications.

 b. If the CHPO, upon examination of submitted plans and specifications, determines that the alterations are consistent with the purposes of SMC Chapter 25.12 and the Central Waterfront Piers Design Guidelines the alterations shall be approved without further action by the Board.

 c. If the CHPO does not approve the alterations, the owner may submit revised materials to the CHPO, or apply to the Board for a Certificate of Approval under SMC Chapter 25.12, as provided in Section 2.A.

 2. The CHPO shall transmit a written decision on the owner's request to the owner within 14 business days of receipt of the request. Failure of the CHPO to approve or disapprove the request shall constitute approval of the request.

 3. CHPO approval for changes or alterations to the designated features or characteristics of the landmark described in Section 1.B of this ordinance, is available for the following:

 a. For the specified features and characteristics of the building, the addition or elimination of duct conduits, HVAC vents, grilles, fire escapes, pipes, and other similar wiring or mechanical elements necessary for the normal operation of the building; and changes that encourage energy efficiency and renewable energy efforts including but not limited to solar panels and sky lights.

 b. The replacement of deteriorated wood pier pilings and decking with other materials as necessary to meet requirements of applicable environmental regulations. The Board and the CHPO recognize the unique maintenance challenges of the saltwater environment, and that state and federal regulations make it no longer possible to replace existing wood pier pilings and wood decking in- kind, but that it is important that the replacement be sympathetic. Specifically, the DNR does not authorize the use of treated wood for pilings or decking replacement of deteriorated wood. Treated wood includes wood treated with creosote, AZCA (Ammoniacal Copper Arsenate), and CCA Type C (Chromated Copper Arsenate). Acceptable alternative wood replacement products for pier pilings and decking are steel, concrete, and recycled plastic, as well as other materials that allow for light penetration through decking.

 c. Alterations to the projecting glazed addition on the south elevation of Pier 56.

 d. New building signage where there is an approved signage plan in place.

 e. Replacement of existing awnings, if not in- kind.

 Section 3.  INCENTIVES. The following incentives are hereby granted on the features and characteristics of Pier 56 that were designated by the Board for preservation:

 A. Uses not otherwise permitted in a zone may be authorized in a designated Landmark by means of an administrative conditional use permit issued pursuant to Seattle Municipal Code Title 23.

 B. Exceptions to certain requirements of the Seattle Building Code, SMC Chapter 22.100, and the Energy Code of the City, SMC Chapter 22.700, may be authorized pursuant to the applicable provisions thereof.

 C. Special tax valuation for historic preservation may be available under Chapter 84.26 RCW upon application and compliance with the requirements of that statute.

 Section 4. Enforcement of this ordinance and penalties for its violation are as provided in SMC 25.12.910.

 Section 5. Pier 56 is hereby added alphabetically to Section II, Buildings, of the Table of Historical Landmarks contained in SMC Chapter 25.32.

 Section 6. The City Clerk is directed to record a certified copy of this ordinance with the King County Director of Records and Elections, deliver two certified copies to the CHPO, and deliver one copy to the Director of the Department of Planning and Development. The CHPO is directed to provide a certified copy of the ordinance to the owner of the landmark.
