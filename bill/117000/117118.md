 AN ORDINANCE vacating a portion of Wolcott Avenue between the east margin of Rainier Avenue South and the west margin of the alley in Block 17, C.D. Hillman's Atlantic City Addition to the City of Seattle Division No. 2, on the petition of Housing Resources Group and Chung Tai International Chan Buddhist Association; suspending the vacation compensation provision of Seattle Municipal Code subsection 15.62.090A to accept one-half the appraised value for the purposes of this ordinance only; and accepting a Property Use and Development Agreement as reflected in Clerk File 309627.

 WHEREAS, the Housing Resources Group and Chung Tai International Chan Buddhist Association ("Petitioners") filed a petition to vacate a portion of Wolcott Avenue between the east margin of Rainier Avenue South and the west margin of the alley in Block 17, C.D. Hillman's Atlantic City Addition to the City of Seattle Division No. 2; and

 WHEREAS, following a May 19, 2009 public hearing on the petition, the Seattle City Council ("City Council") conditionally granted the petition subject to conditions that have now been met; and

 WHEREAS, a Property Use and Development Agreement recorded with the King County Recorder's Office commits the Housing Resources Group and their successors to fulfill ongoing public-benefit obligations required as a result of the street vacation; and

 WHEREAS, the City Council finds there are unique circumstances associated with this vacation including: the unusual size and orientation of the right-of-way that impedes developing adjacent parcels, the property's location in an economically-depressed area, the fact that the property has been vacant and undeveloped for an extended period of time, the suitability of the development to support transit use given its location on an arterial at a major bus stop, the City Council's support for providing low-income housing, and the City's investment in developing low-income housing for this project; and

 WHEREAS, the City Council finds that the totality of the unique circumstances associated with the vacation support considering the vacation fee paid to the City; and for the purposes of this ordinance only, the vacation compensation provision of Seattle Municipal Code subsection 15.62.090A is suspended, and a fee of one-half of the appraised value, $232,800, is accepted for the vacated street; and

 WHEREAS, as provided for by Section 35.79.030 RCW, and Seattle Municipal Code Chapter 15.62 except subsection 15.62.090A which has been suspended for the purposes of this ordinance only; the Petitioners have paid the City a vacation fee of one-half the appraised value of the property; NOW, THEREFORE,
