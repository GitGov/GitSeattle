 EASEMENT FOR STORM REGULATOR

 THIS EASEMENT granted this _______ day of _____________________, 2011, by Central Puget Sound Regional Transit Authority, ("Sound Transit") a regional transit authority, of the State of Washington, hereinafter called "Grantor," to The City of Seattle, a municipal corporation of the State of Washington, acting by and through Seattle Public Utilities ("SPU"), hereinafter called "Grantee."

 WHEREAS; Grantor has acquired ownership of certain real property (King County Tax Parcel # 7666203076) commonly known as the southeast intersection of South Hanford Street and 8th Avenue South, under King County Recording No. ____________________, from Grantee, who reserved this easement for a storm regulator and necessary appurtenances ("Facilities"), which Grantee owns and operates as part of its municipal drainage utility system; and

 The Grantor, its heirs, successors and assigns, shall have the right to use said Easement Area in any way and for any purpose consistent with the rights herein granted.

 A. Grantee's Uses

 1. Access. The Grantee shall have the right without prior institution of any suit or proceeding at law, at such time as may be necessary, to enter upon said the Property and Easement Area for the Purposes herein described, without incurring any legal obligation or liability therefore.

 a. For any Purpose that does not involve excavation, boring, or tunneling, Grantee

 shall notify Grantor at least forty-eight (48) hours prior to entry, except as

 provided in Section A.1.c below.

 b. For any Purpose that involves excavation, boring, or tunneling, Grantee shall

 submit its work plan to Grantor for approval no less than ninety (90) days prior to

 the requested work commencement date, except as provided in section A.1.c below. Grantor shall provide said approval, including restrictions and conditions

 reasonably appropriate to protect Grantor's Facilities and operations and deemed

 by Grantee to be consistent with prudent management of the Facilities or a written objection specifying the grounds therefor, within thirty (30) days of submittal of Grantee's work plan. Grantor's approval shall not be unreasonably denied.

 c. Notwithstanding Section A.1.a or b above, in the event that Grantee determines that damage to or destruction of the Facilities has or will imminently occur requiring immediate action to protect the public health, safety and welfare and requiring immediate access across or over Grantor's Property ("Emergency"), Grantee shall notify the Grantor's Light Rail Control Center as soon as feasible under the circumstances. Grantor recognizes Grantee's need for immediate access in an Emergency and acknowledges the goal of Grantee access within one hour of notification.

 "X*" indicates that, in an Emergency, Grantee may perform the task assigned to Grantor in the matrix and Grantee will be reimbursed by Grantor for costs incurred.

 "X**" indicates that each party shall each bear its own cost for the task.

 b. When Grantor Facilities Work is performed, Grantee shall reimburse Grantor an amount representing the cost that Grantee would have incurred to restore nine (9) inch concrete paving, calculated as follows: The cost per square foot shall be based on the applicable annual rate used generally by the Seattle Department of Transportation for reimbursement of utility cut repairs on behalf of public and private utilities in the City.

 2.

The actual costs for any Grantee activity (including without limitation boring, tunneling, inspection, operation, maintenance, repair and work schedule adjustments to accommodate Grantor's request) that occurs from time to time in the Easement Area less Grantee's reasonable estimate of the cost of such activity if there were no surface, above-ground or below-ground Grantor's Facilities is referred to herein as "Incremental Costs." The calculation of Incremental Costs shall take into account both cost savings and cost increases, and the Incremental Costs may be offset against the Reimbursement Amount due from Grantee under this Section. In the work plan required under section A.1.b, Grantee will make reasonable efforts to identify and estimate any Incremental Costs, but such identification shall not be a condition of Grantor's obligation to reimburse Grantee for Incremental Costs that Grantee may incur from time to time.

 D. Indemnification

 1. To the extent permitted by law, the Grantor and Grantee each shall protect, defend, indemnify, and save harmless the other Party, and its officials, employees, and agents from any and all costs, claims, demands, judgments, damages, or liability of any kind, including injuries to persons or damages to property, to the extent caused by the negligent acts, omissions or willful misconduct of the indemnifying Party. Each Party agrees that its obligations under this section extend to any claim, demand, or cause of action brought by, or on behalf of, any of its employees or agents.For this purpose, each Party, by mutual negotiation, hereby waives, with respect to the other Party only, any immunity that would otherwise be available against such claims under the industrial insurance provisions of Title 51 RCW.

 In the event of any claims, demands, actions and lawsuits, the indemnifying Party upon prompt notice from the other Party shall assume all costs of defense thereof, including legal fees incurred by the other party, and of all resulting judgments that may be obtained against the other party. In the event that any Party incurs attorney fees, costs or other legal expenses to enforce the provisions of this section, all such fees, costs and expenses shall be recoverable by the prevailing Party.

 2. Notwithstanding any provision of this Easement Agreement to the contrary, however, the foregoing indemnities shall not apply to any claims, causes of action, regulatory demands, liabilities, fines, penalties, injuries to third persons, losses, and expenses including, without limitation, regulatory requirements for cleanup or other remedial costs (including reasonable attorneys' fees, costs and reasonable litigation expenses incurred in defense of actual litigation or in reasonable anticipation of litigation) that arise from an Environmental Condition. An "Environmental Condition" includes (1) the existence or discovery of any hazardous substance, pollution or contamination within, on or under the Easement Areas, or the migration of any hazardous substance, pollution or contamination from the Easement Areas into the surrounding property and (2) violation of any local, state or federal environmental law or regulation providing for the regulation of hazardous substances or contamination. Neither Grantor nor Grantee shall be precluded from seeking relief from any other party under the State Model Toxics Control Act ("MTCA"), the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act ("CERCLA"), other similar laws, or common law, for damages, contribution, cost recovery damages or other reimbursement relating to Environmental Conditions. Grantor and Grantee intend that this Easement Agreement not alter or affect whatever liability or responsibility either Party may have for hazardous substance releases or threatened releases under CERCLA, MTCA, or other similar laws or common law.

 H. Dispute Resolution

If the representatives of the Parties identified in section I cannot resolve a dispute, the dispute shall be referred to the Director of the Link Light Rail Division and the Director of Seattle Public Utilities for further negotiation. Only upon failure to resolve the dispute through such negotiations may either Party pursue legal action.
