 ORDINANCE _________________

 AN ORDINANCE related to the Board of Park Commissioners; authorizing a Get Engaged young adult position to the Board of Park Commissioners; changing the membership composition and terms of Park Commissioners; and amending Section 3.26.010 of the Seattle Municipal Code.

 WHEREAS, in 2002, Ordinance 120325 established a two-year pilot program entitled Get Engaged: City Boards and Commissions (Get Engaged). The program encouraged young adult participation on City boards and commissions; and

 WHEREAS, in 2004, Ordinance 121568 acknowledged the success of Get Engaged and made the Program permanent; and

 WHEREAS, the Board of Park Commissioners (Park Board) and the City seek to increase young adult participation on the Board of Park Commissioners, and recognize the success Get Engaged has had in placing young adults on other City boards and commissions; and

 WHEREAS, a nine-member Park Board will allow for increased young adult participation and avoid the potential for tie votes; and

 WHEREAS, pursuant to Ordinance 122332 (2007) all Park Commissioners' terms expire on December 31 of their final year of service; and

 WHEREAS, advertising, interviewing, and confirming Park Board appointees at the end of the year is inconvenient and problematic; NOW, THEREFORE,
