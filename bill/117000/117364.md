 Rebecca Salinas DPR Center for Wooden Boats Lease Amend 2011 ORD October 25, 2011 Version # 1

 AMENDMENT TO GROUND LEASE

 This Amendment to the September 7, 2011, Ground Lease by and between THE CITY OF SEATTLE ("City"), a Washington municipal corporation, and CENTER FOR WOODEN BOATS ("CWB"), a Washington not-for-profit corporation, is effective as of ____________, 2011 (the "Effective Date").

 Recitals

 1. On or about September 7, 2011, the parties executed a 25-year Ground Lease ("Lease") pursuant to which CWB was granted the right to use the leased area in Lake Union Park for developing an education center.

 2. Under the Lease, CWB is prevented from taking possession of the leased premises until execution of a use agreement between the City and the State of Washington, Department of Natural Resources, allowing the City to utilize a portion of State- owned property in the vicinity of Lake Union Park and formerly under CWB's control, for park purposes.

 3. For reasons beyond CWB's control, that use agreement has not yet been executed although the City has expanded Lake Union Park into the affected area and that area is now open for general public access.

 4. It is in the parties' mutual best interests to allow CWB to move forward with development of its education center although the SubArea B use agreement has not yet been executed inasmuch as the fundamental purposes of that agreement have been effectuated.

 1. Possession Date. Section 1.3 of the Agreement is amended to delete clause (ii).
