 AN ORDINANCE relating to the King Street Station Rehabilitation Phase 2B Project; ratifying and confirming Seattle Department of Transportation's execution of a grant agreement with the Washington State Department of Transportation for and on behalf of the City of Seattle, under which agreement the City will receive over 16 million dollars in funding for the restoration of King Street Station.

 WHEREAS, on October 28, 2010, the Federal Railroad Administration (FRA) announced the selection of the King Street Station Seismic Retrofit Project for seismic upgrades and other improvements for the Phase 2B restoration of King Street Station in Seattle, Washington, hereafter referred to as the "Project"; and

 WHEREAS, the City of Seattle took ownership of King Street Station from the Burlington Northern Santa Fe Railway in 2008; and

 WHEREAS, one of the purposes of the FRA grant for the Project is to improve inter-city passenger rail service for the traveling public; and

 WHEREAS, the FRA is providing $16,685,752 in federal funding for the Project through a separate agreement, FR-HSR- 0114-12-01-00, between the FRA and the Washington State Department of Transportation ("WSDOT") executed on Nov 18, 2011; and

 WHEREAS, WSDOT is providing $2,445,000 in funding to the Project; and

 WHEREAS, in June 2011 WSDOT and the Seattle Department of Transportation ("SDOT") began negotiating an agreement that would provide the federal and state funding to the Project; and

 WHEREAS, when the negotiations with SDOT began, WSDOT was still working out the terms and conditions of its agreement with the FRA with the result that many of the detailed terms between SDOT and WSDOT were negotiated on a short timeline; and

 WHEREAS, the City's current Adopted Capital Improvement Program includes the grant funding for the Project; and

 WHEREAS, the terms of funding required by the FRA require the City to maintain the Project for 20 years and make the Station available to Amtrak, or the State's inter-city passenger rail provider; and

 WHEREAS, the City has commenced making phased improvements to King Street Station using local, state, and federal funding sources; and

 WHEREAS, WSDOT and City funds will be expended on the Project to satisfy FRA matching fund requirements; and

 WHEREAS, the Project will include seismic upgrades to the station foundations, walls, and clock tower, as well as other interior and exterior improvements to the station; and

 WHEREAS, in order to avoid losing the federal funding, SDOT was required to execute an agreement prior to the time an ordinance could be submitted to Seattle City Council for authorization, and SDOT did so after briefing the Mayor and Seattle City Council Central staff; NOW, THEREFORE,

 BE IT ORDAINED BY THE CITY OF SEATTLE AS FOLLOWS:

 Section 1.
