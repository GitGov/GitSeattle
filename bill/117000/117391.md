 EXHIBIT C

 Option to Renew

 Tenant is granted the option to extend the term of this Lease beyond the expiration of the initial term for sixty (60) months (the "Extended Term") on the same terms and conditions contained in the Lease except for the Base Rent. The conditions which must be met for Tenant to exercise its right are as follows:

 (a) Tenant shall not be in default on the date of notice;

 (b) Tenant has fully and faithfully performed all of the covenants, conditions and terms of this Lease at all times;

 (c) Tenant shall deliver to Landlord written notice ("Election Notice") of Tenant's election to exercise the option to extend at least six (6) months but not more than nine (9) months before the Expiration Date.

 If Tenant fails to satisfy or comply with any or all of the above conditions, then the option to extend shall be void and of no force of effect. If Tenant satisfies and complies with all of such conditions and elects to exercise the option to extend, the minimum rent shall be adjusted to Fair Market Rent for comparable buildings in the Seattle-Belltown area. Upon the Tenant exercising its option to renew, the parties will use good faith efforts to reach an agreement on what constitutes Fair Market Rent for the Extended Term. In no case shall the Fair Market Rent for the Extended Term be less than minimum rent for the last year of the Lease Term. If the parties are unable to agree upon Fair Market Rent after a thirty (30) day period within which the parties shall attempt to negotiate such rent, the parties agree to submit the matter to binding arbitration with a single arbitrator in accordance with Washington law; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that the difference in Landlord's determination of Fair Market Rent and that of Tenant's determination of market rent must vary more than five percent (5%) for any arbitration to apply. (If the difference is five percent (5%) or less, then the difference shall be split in half.) The arbitrator shall be a licensed real estate broker who has been active over the previous five (5) year period in the leasing of office spaces. If Landlord and Tenant are unable to agree on the arbitrator within ten (10) days after the election of the parties to determine Fair Market Rent by arbitration, each shall select a broker who shall be qualified under the same criteria set forth above, and so notify the other party in writing within ten (10) days after the end of such ten (10) day period. The two brokers so chosen by the parties shall then appoint the arbitrator within ten (10) days after the date of the appointment of the last appointed broker. If the two brokers so chosen by the parties are unable to agree on the arbitrator within such ten (10) day period, the arbitrator will be appointed by the director (or the equivalent) of the Seattle Office of the American Arbitration Association upon the application of either party. If either party fails to timely select its broker and so notify the other party in writing within the foregoing ten (10) day period, and the other party timely selects its broker, then the broker selected by the other party shall be the arbitrator for determining Fair Market Rent. Within thirty (30) days after the selection of the arbitrator, the arbitrator shall determine Fair Market Rent by selecting either the Fair Market Rent stated in Landlord's submission to the arbitrator or the Fair Market Rent stated in Tenant's submission. The arbitrator shall have no power to average such amounts or to designate a Fair Market Rent other than that specified in either Landlord's submission or Tenant's submission. Both parties may submit any information to the arbitrator for his or her consideration, with copies to the other party. The arbitrator shall have the right to consult experts and competent authorities for factual information or evidence pertaining to the determination of Fair Market Rent. The arbitrator shall render his or her decision by written notice to each party. The determination of the arbitrator will be final and binding upon Landlord and Tenant.

 Notwithstanding anything in this Lease to the contrary, Landlord shall have the right to terminate this Lease only during the Extended Term and only in the event that Landlord elects to redevelop the Premises. As used in this Lease, "redevelopment" means the demolition of the Premises and construction of a new building at the same location, whether as a stand-alone development or as part of a larger project. Landlord's intent to redevelop the Premises must be evidenced by Landlord's application for a building permit that includes such demolition and construction. If Landlord elects to terminate this Lease as provided in this Exhibit C, then Landlord shall notify Tenant of its election at least 12 months prior to the date of Landlord's building permit or Master Use Permit application, in writing.

 In the event of termination due to redevelopment of the Premises and only during the Extended Term, Tenant shall have the right of first negotiation of a satisfactory lease or purchase agreement with Landlord for ground-floor space within the redevelopment of equal or greater size and utility to the leased Premises and at Fair Market Value. Tenant's right of first negotiation shall commence on the date Landlord provides Tenant with written notice of termination and expire 30 days after Landlord provides Tenant with written notice of receipt of building permit. If the parties are unable to agree on the Fair Market Value of the redeveloped premises, then the parties shall submit the matter to binding arbitration as described above. If the parties are unable to negotiate a satisfactory agreement during this period, then this Lease shall terminate in accordance with Landlord's notice and the parties shall thereafter have no further obligations with respect to one another under this Lease, with the exception of those obligations expressly stated to survive termination.
