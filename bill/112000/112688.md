 AN ORDINANCE relating to enforcement of the Land Use Code, amending the enforcement process for certain violations of Title 23 of the Seattle Municipal Code, amending Section 23.40.002, adding a new Chapter 23.91, and adding new definitions to Chapter 23.84.

 WHEREAS, the current enforcement system for processing Land Use Code violations recognizes that the majority of citizens will voluntarily comply with the code requirements once they are aware of a violation on their property; and

 WHEREAS, the current enforcement system can be changed to be more effective in dealing with the more difficult land use cases, particularly those involving repeat offenders and property owners who are unwilling to comply with the City's requirements; and

 WHEREAS, it is appropriate that the Land Use Code should discourage repeat violations by imposing increasing penalties; and

 WHEREAS, enforcement of the Land Use Code should efficiently use resources and focus the most resources on difficult cases; and

 WHEREAS, because violations of the Land Use Code have a serious impact on the community, it is sometimes appropriate to assess a penalty irrespective of how quickly the violation is cured in order to deter such violations; and

 WHEREAS, it is appropriate to utilize this new enforcement tool on Land Use Code violations that are readily and clearly identifiable from the public domain; that can be brought into compliance in a reasonably short length of time; that have a significant impact on the surrounding community; and that include a high percentage of the Land Use Code enforcement cases;

 NOW THEREFORE,

 BE IT ORDAINED BY THE CITY OF SEATTLE AS FOLLOWS:

 Section 1. Section 23.40.002 of the Seattle Municipal Code, which was last amended by Ordinance 118794, is amended as follows:

 23.40.002 Conformity with regulations required.

 The establishment or change of use of any structures, buildings or premises, or any part thereof, shall require approval according to the procedures set forth in Chapter 23.76, Procedures for Master Use Permits and Council Land Use Decisions. No use of any structure or premises shall hereafter be commenced, and no structure or part of a structure shall be erected, moved, reconstructed, extended, enlarged or altered, except in conformity with the regulations specified in this title for the zone and overlay district, if any, in which it is or will be located. Owners of such structures, buildings or premises or parts thereof are responsible for any failure of such structures, buildings or premises to conform to the regulations of this title and for compliance with the provisions of this title in or on such structures, buildings or premises. Any other person who created, caused or contributed to a condition in or on such structure, building or premises, either alone or with others, is also responsible under this title for any failure to conform to the regulations of this title. Building and use permits on file shall be prima facie evidence of the time a building was built or modified, or a use commenced, and the burden of demonstrating to the contrary shall be upon the owner. Changes to existing structures may be permitted which make the structures nonconforming if the changes are required by law for reasons of health and safety.

 Section 2. Section 23.84.028 of the Seattle Municipal Code, which was last amended by Ordinance 118472, is amended to add a definition to be put in alphabetical order as follows:

 23.84.028 "O"

 "Owner" means any person having a legal or equitable interest in, title to, responsibility for, or possession of a building or property, including, but not limited to, the interest of a lessee, guardian, receiver or trustee, and any duly authorized agent of the owner.

 Section 3. A new Section 23.91.002 is hereby added to the Seattle Municipal Code, to read as follows:

 23.91.002 Scope.

 A. Violations of the following provisions of Seattle Municipal Code Chapter 23 shall be enforced under the citation or criminal provisions set forth in this Chapter 23.91:

 2. Construction or maintenance of structures in required yards or setbacks in residential zones (Sections 23.44.014, 23.44.040, 23.45.005, 23.45.014, 23.45.056, and 23.45.072);

 B. Any enforcement action or proceeding pursuant to this chapter 23.91 shall not affect, limit or preclude any previous, pending or subsequent enforcement action or proceeding taken pursuant to chapter 23.90.

 Section 4. A new Section 23.91.004 is hereby added to the Seattle Municipal Code, to read as follows:

 23.91.004 Citation.

 A. Citation. If after investigation the Director determines that the standards or requirements of provisions referenced in Section 23.91.002 have been violated, the Director may issue a citation to the owner and/or other person or entity responsible for the violation. The citation shall include the following information: 1) the name and address of the person to which the citation is issued; 2) a reasonable description of the location of the property on which the violation occurred; 3) a separate statement of each standard or requirement violated; 4) the date of the violation; 5) a statement that the person cited must respond to the citation within fifteen (15) days after service; 6) a space for entry of the applicable penalty; 7) a statement that a response must be sent to the Hearing Examiner and postmarked not later than midnight on the day the response is due; 8) the name, address and phone number of the Hearing Examiner where the citation is filed; 9) a statement that the citation represents a determination that a violation has been committed by the person named in the citation and that the determination shall be final unless contested as provided in this chapter; and 10) a certified statement of the inspector issuing the citation, authorized by RCW 9A72.085, setting forth facts supporting issuance of the citation.

 B. Service. The citation may be served by personal service in the manner set forth in RCW 4.28.080 for service of a summons or sent by first class mail, addressed to the last known address of such person(s). Service shall be complete at the time of personal service, or if mailed, three (3) days after the date of mailing. If a citation sent by first class mail is returned as undeliverable, service may be made by posting the citation at a conspicuous place on the property.

 Section 5. A new Section 23.91.006 is hereby added to the Seattle Municipal Code, to read as follows:

 23.91.006 Response to citations.

 Within fifteen (15) days after the date the citation is served, a person must respond to a citation in one of the following ways:

 Paying the amount of the monetary penalty specified in the citation, in which case the record shall show a finding that the person cited has committed the violation; or

 Requesting in writing a mitigation hearing to explain the circumstances surrounding the commission of the violation and providing a mailing address to which notice of such hearing may be sent; or

 Requesting a contested hearing in writing specifying the reason why the cited violation did not occur or why the person cited is not responsible for the violation, and providing a mailing address to which notice of such hearing may be sent.

 Section 6. A new Section 23.91.008 is hereby added to the Seattle Municipal Code, to read as follows:

 23.91.008 Failure to respond.

 If a person fails to respond to a citation within fifteen (15) days of service, an order shall be entered by the Hearing Examiner finding that the person cited committed the violation stated in the citation, and assessing the penalty specified in the citation.

 Section 7. A new Section 23.91.010 is hereby added to the Seattle Municipal Code, to read as follows:

 23.91.010 Mitigation Hearings.

 Date and Notice. If a person requests a mitigation hearing, the mitigation hearing shall be held within thirty (30) days after written response to the citation requesting such hearing is received by the Hearing Examiner. Notice of the time, place, and date of the hearing will be sent by first class mail to the address provided in the request for hearing not less than ten (10) days prior to the date of the hearing.

 Procedure at Hearing. The Hearing Examiner shall hold an informal hearing which shall not be governed by the Rules of Evidence. The person cited may present witnesses, but witnesses may not be compelled to attend. A representative from DCLU may also be present and may present additional information, but attendance by a representative from DCLU is not required.

 Disposition. The Hearing Examiner shall determine whether the person's explanation justifies reduction of the monetary penalty; however, the monetary penalty may not be reduced unless the person provides at the hearing a certificate of compliance from DCLU that the violation has been corrected prior to the mitigation hearing. Factors that may be considered in whether to reduce the penalty include whether the violation was caused by the act, neglect, or abuse of another; or whether correction of the violation was commenced promptly prior to citation but that full compliance was prevented by a condition or circumstance beyond the control of the person cited.

 Entry of Order. After hearing the explanation of the person cited and any other information presented at the hearing, the Hearing Examiner shall enter an order finding that the person cited committed the violation and assessing a monetary penalty in an amount determined pursuant to this section. The Hearing Examiner's decision is the final decision of the City on the matter.

 Section 8. A new Section 23.91.012 is hereby added to the Seattle Municipal Code, to read as follows:

 23.91.012 Contested hearing.

 Date and Notice. If a person requests a contested hearing, the hearing shall be held within sixty (60) days after the written response to the citation requesting such hearing is received.

 Hearing. Contested hearings shall be conducted pursuant to the procedures for hearing contested cases contained in Section 3.02.090 and the rules adopted by the Hearing Examiner for hearing contested cases, except as modified by this section. The issues heard at the hearing shall be limited to those that are raised in writing in the response to the citation and that are within the jurisdiction of the Hearing Examiner. The Hearing Examiner may issue subpoenas for the attendance of witnesses and the production of documents.

 Sufficiency. No citation shall be deemed insufficient for failure to contain a detailed statement of the facts constituting the specific violation which the person cited is alleged to have committed or by reason of defects or imperfections, provided such lack of detail, or defects or imperfections do not prejudice substantial rights of the person cited.

 Amendment of Citation. A citation may be amended prior to the conclusion of the hearing to conform to the evidence presented if substantial rights of the person cited are not thereby prejudiced.

 Evidence at Hearing. The certified statement or declaration authorized by RCW 9A.72.085 submitted by an inspector shall be prima facie evidence that a violation occurred and that the person cited is responsible. The certified statement or declaration of the inspector authorized under RCW 9A.72.085 and any other evidence accompanying the report shall be admissible without further evidentiary foundation. Any certifications or declarations authorized under RCW 9A.72.085 shall also be admissible without further evidentiary foundation. The person cited may rebut the DCLU evidence and establish that the cited violation(s) did not occur or that the person contesting the citation is not responsible for the violation.

 Disposition. If the citation is sustained at the hearing, the Hearing Examiner shall enter an order finding that the person cited committed the violation. If the violation remains uncorrected, the Hearing Examiner shall impose the applicable penalty. The Hearing Examiner may reduce the monetary penalty in accordance with the mitigation provisions in 23.91.010 if the violation has been corrected. If the Hearing Examiner determines that the violation did not occur, the Hearing Examiner shall enter an order dismissing the citation.

 Appeal. The Hearing Examiner's decision shall be final unless one of the parties initiates review by writ of certiorari in King County Superior Court within fifteen (15) days after entry of the Hearing Examiner's decision.

 Section 9. A new Section 23.91.014 is hereby added to the Seattle Municipal Code, to read as follows:

 23.91.014 Failure to Appear for Hearing.

 Failure to appear for a requested hearing will result in an order being entered finding that the person cited committed the violation stated in the citation and assessing the penalty specified in the citation. For good cause shown and upon terms the Hearing Examiner deems just, the Hearing Examiner may set aside an order entered upon a failure to appear.

 Section 10. A new Section 23.91.016 is hereby added to the Seattle Municipal Code, to read as follows:

 23.91.016 Penalties.

 First Violation. The first time that a person or entity is found to have violated one of the provisions referenced in Section 23.91.002 after the effective date of this ordinance, the person or entity shall be subject to a penalty of One Hundred Fifty dollars ($150.00).

 Second and Subsequent Violations. Any subsequent time that a person or entity is found to have violated one of the provisions referenced in Section 23.91.002 within a five (5) year period after the first violation, the person or entity shall be subject to a penalty of Five hundred dollars ($500.00) for each such violation.

The Director may request the City Attorney to prosecute such violations criminally as an alternative to the citation procedure outlined in this Chapter.

 Section 12. A new Section 23.91.020 is hereby added to the Seattle Municipal Code, to read as follows:

 23.91.020. Abatement.

 23.91.022 Collection of penalties.

 If the person cited fails to pay a penalty imposed pursuant to this chapter, the penalty may be referred to a collection agency. The cost to the city for the collection services will be assessed as costs, at the rate agreed to between the City and the collection agency, and added to the penalty. Alternatively, the City may pursue collection in any other manner allowed by law.

 Section 14. A new Section 23.91.024 is hereby added to the Seattle Municipal Code, to read as follows:

 23.91.024 Each day a separate violation.

 Each day a person or entity violates or fails to comply with a provision referenced in Section 23.91.002 may be considered a separate violation for which a citation may be issued.

 Section 15. A new Section 23.91.026 is hereby added to the Seattle Municipal Code, to read as follows:

 23.91.026 Additional relief.

 The Director may seek legal or equitable relief at any time to enjoin any acts or practices that violate the provisions referenced in Section 23.91.002 or abate any condition that constitutes a nuisance.

 Section 16. The provisions of this ordinance are declared to be separate and severable and the invalidity of any clause, sentence, paragraph, subdivision, section, subsection, or portion of this ordinance, or the invalidity of the application thereof to any person or circumstance, shall not affect the validity of the remainder of this ordinance or the validity of its application to other persons or circumstances.

 Section 17. This ordinance shall take effect and be in force forty-five (45) days from and after its approval by the Mayor, but if not approved and returned by the Mayor within ten (10) days after presentation, it shall take effect as provided by Municipal Code
