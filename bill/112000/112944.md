 AN ORDINANCE relating to Seattle Transportation's Commuter Services Program; establishing and amending fees for carpool parking permits and for the Guaranteed Ride Home Benefit.

 WHEREAS, Seattle Municipal Code Section 11.16.310 authorizes the Director of Transportation to implement and collect carpool parking fees established from time to time by ordinance; and

 WHEREAS, Ordinance 118278 set quarterly carpool parking permit fees for the Fauntleroy and Queen Anne carpool parking areas, and directed that carpool parking permit fees be deposited into the Transportation Operating Fund to be used for administration, inspection and policing of the carpool program;

 WHEREAS, Ordinance 117107 set carpool parking permit fees for the Freeway Carpool Lot; and

 WHEREAS, the City wishes to encourage the use of highest occupancy and non-motorized modes of commuting; and

 WHEREAS, current carpool parking fees for the City's public carpool parking are lower than carpool parking fees in private facilities; and

 WHEREAS, the City wishes to structure its carpool parking fees so that they are not disincentives to the use of public transportation by commuters traveling between areas that are well-served by transit;

 NOW THEREFORE,

 BE IT ORDAINED BY THE CITY OF SEATTLE AS FOLLOWS:

 Section 1. For the purposes of this ordinance, the following phrase shall have the following meaning:

 "The Central Business District" means that area bounded by Denny Way to the north, Royal Brougham Way to the south, the waterfront to the west and Interstate 5 to the east.

 Section 2. The Director of the Transportation Department is authorized to continue the Parking Days for Eligible Commuters program as originally established by Ordinance 117298 to provide parking spaces in the Municipal Building Garage for registered participants in the City's Commute Trip Reduction Program's Guaranteed Ride Home Program on days they need their private vehicles at work. The Director is authorized to collect a fee and issue permits for parking spaces in the Municipal Building Garage from said participants of $7.00 per day per participant. Said participants may purchase a Municipal Building Garage parking permit no more than two times per month. No more than fifteen spaces shall be made available on a given day to participants.

 Section 3. As requested by the Director of Transportation and recommended by the Mayor, the Director of Transportation is authorized to issue and charge fees for any permit authorizing carpool parking during and after the period December 31, 1999 through December 31, 2000 in dedicated areas as follows:

 Location Carpool Occupancy Fee

 Central Business 3 or more $125.00 per District quarter

 Central Business 2 $250.00 per District quarter

 Fauntleroy Ferry 2 or more $ 75.00 per Dock quarter

 Yesler Street 2 or more $125.00 per Overpass

 quarter

 Queen Anne 2 or more $ 75.00 per quarter

 This fee schedule supersedes all prior fee schedules to the extent inconsistent therewith.

 Section 4. Carpool parking permit fees authorized in Section 3 and fees collected for the Guaranteed Ride Home Parking Benefit authorized in Section 2 shall be deposited into the Transportation Operating Fund. It is the intent of the Council to appropriate such funds to be used for the administration and enforcement of the Carpool Program, and for activities that promote trip reduction and the use of high- occupancy vehicles and discourage the use of single-occupant vehicles.

 Section 5. Any act consistent with the authority and prior to the effective date of this ordinance is hereby ratified and confirmed.

 Section 6. This ordinance shall take effect and be in force thirty (30) days from and after its approval by the Mayor, but if not approved and returned by the Mayor within ten (10) days after presentation, it shall take effect as provided by Municipal Code Section 1.04.020.
