 ORDINANCE __________________

 AN ORDINANCE relating to the 1999 adopted budget; increasing the expenditure allowances in the 1999 budgets of the Human Services Department and the Executive Services Department, and correspondingly reducing the 1999 budgets of the Legislative Department and the Executive Department.[These deletions aren't really needed, but I suggest them so you can consider whether you want to simplify life and keep it at the dept. level. In the future, this sort of simplification might avoid having to change the title and hold things a week when an item changes.]

 WHEREAS, the Legislative Department and the Executive Department, Strategic Planning Office, have budget authority in their 1999 budgets that was carried forward by ordinance from their 1998 unexpended budget authority; and

 WHEREAS, the expenditures for these purposes in 1999 will be made from different departments than the ones with the carried-over budget authority;

 NOW, THEREFORE,

 BE IT ORDAINED BY THE CITY OF SEATTLE AS FOLLOWS:

 Section 1. Expenditure authority in the 1999 budgets of the following departments for the following program categories is increased by the following amounts:

 Department Program Category Amount

 Executive Services,

 Policy and Administration Div. A11 $67,500

 City Budget Division A55 $38,000

 and for these purposes, (A) the 1999 budget of the Legislative Department, program category G11, is reduced by the sum of Twenty Thousand Dollars ($20,000), and (B) the 1999 budget of the Executive Department, Strategic Planning Office, program category X8M, is reduced by the sum of One Hundred Five Thousand Five Hundred Dollars ($105,500). Unencumbered and unexpended portions of these appropriations shall carry forward to the 2000 budget.

 Section 2. Any act consistent with the authority and prior to the effective date of this ordinance is hereby ratified and confirmed.

 Section 3. This ordinance shall take effect and be in force thirty (30) days from and after its approval by the Mayor, but if not approved and returned by the Mayor within ten (10) days after presentation, it shall take effect as provided by Municipal Code Section 1.04.020.
