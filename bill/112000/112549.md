 AN ORDINANCE modifying the Demonstration Program for Innovative Housing Design established by Ordinance 119241 by adding an additional type of cottage housing developments to be tested, clarifying the height departure for detached accessory dwelling units, and amending Section 23.40.050 of the Seattle Municipal Code.

 WHEREAS, the City Council adopted Ordinance 119241 on November 30, 1998 and the Mayor signed it on December 2, 1998; and

 WHEREAS, Ordinance 119241 included a recital stating that "the Department of Construction and Land Use will continue to review whether the Demonstration Program should include demonstration projects to test whether to allow further flexibility for cottage housing developments in an effort to encourage such developments and will propose possible amendments to the Demonstration Program by mid-January 1999;" and

 WHEREAS, the Department of Design, Construction and Land Use (DCLU) has performed the review required by Ordinance 119241 and on the basis of the DCLU recommendation the City Council now wishes to modify the Demonstration Program to include demonstration projects to test increased density in cottage housing developments under certain limited conditions and to test the concept of allowing increased height for accessory garage structures in cottage housing developments, up to the same height limit as the departures allowed for principal structures in cottage housing developments, when the additional dwelling units allowed by the test for increased density are contained in accessory garage structures; and

 WHEREAS, the DCLU has also learned that the standard for height departures for detached accessory dwelling units contained in Ordinance 119241 for demonstration projects is ambiguous and does not clearly reflect the intent of either DCLU or the Council:

 WHEREAS, the City Council desires to: 1) increase the number of demonstration projects allowed for the Cottage Housing, Tandem Housing or Small Lot Single Family Development category under the Demonstration Program adopted by Ordinance 119241 by four to a total of ten; 2) divide the Cottage Housing, Tandem Housing or Small Lot Single Family Development category into Type A and Type B projects, with Type A describing the category of projects previously adopted by Ordinance 119241, and Type B describing the type of demonstration projects that will be allowed pursuant to this ordinance; 3) set four as the maximum number of Type B projects that may be approved (two in an interim March, 1999 submittal period and two in the July, 1999 submittal period); and 4) clarify the standards for height departures for detached accessory dwelling units to be included in the demonstration program;

 NOW THEREFORE,

 BE IT ORDAINED BY THE CITY OF SEATTLE AS FOLLOWS:

 Section 1. Clarification of Height Departure for Detached Accessory Dwelling Units.

 Of the four categories of projects to be tested by the Demonstration Program adopted by Ordinance 119241, the first category, "Detached Accessory Dwelling Units," is revised to make it clear that the additional height that may be approved through the administrative Design Review process for these demonstration projects is to allow testing of detached accessory dwelling units of similar height as a detached accessory unit located in a single story above a garage, not just detached accessory dwelling units that are contained solely in a single story above a garage.

 Section 2. Cottage Housing, Tandem Housing or Small Lot Single Family Development.

 Of the four categories of projects to be tested by the Demonstration Program adopted by Ordinance 119241, the second category, "Cottage Housing, Tandem Housing or Small Lot Single Family Development," is modified to include a second variation on the type of cottage housing development allowed and the category is divided into two subcategories Type A and Type B projects. Type A projects include the cottage housing, tandem housing or small lot single family housing development demonstration projects described in Ordinance 119241.

 Type B projects will test cottage housing developments that have increased density beyond that currently allowed for cottage housing development and increased height in accessory garage structures above that currently allowed for either accessory or principle structures in cottage housing developments. As with all other demonstration projects, Design Review is required. A maximum of four Type B cottage housing development demonstration projects may be selected. No more than two may be selected in the interim submittal period provided by Section 4 of this Ordinance and no more than two may be selected in the July, 1999 submittal period for the Demonstration Program.

 Section 3. Type B Cottage Housing Development Projects.

 Type B demonstration projects are intended to test for increased density in cottage housing developments in certain circumscribed instances and must comply with the following:

 If the proposed demonstration project exceeds the maximum density allowed by SMC 23.43.012(B) for a cottage housing development, any housing units in excess of the maximum allowed by SMC 23.43.012 must be located above garages in accessory structures provided for the dwelling units in the cottage housing development;

 The maximum number of above-garage units is one for every two cottage houses;

 The accessory garage structures containing the additional units may be no higher than fifteen percent (15%) above the height limit set for principal structures in cottage housing developments;

 Parking must be provided as required by Title 23 for each housing unit (both cottage houses and above-garage units); no parking waivers are allowed; and

 The proposed project must otherwise comply with the development standards for cottage housing developments for Type A demonstration projects contained in Section 4(2) of Ordinance 119241 and SMC 23.40.050(B)(3) and all other provisions of Ordinance 119241 applicable to cottage housing development demonstration projects except as specifically modified by this Ordinance.

 Section 4. Submittal Deadlines.

 There shall be two submittal periods for Type B cottage housing development demonstration projects:

 For Type B cottage housing development applications submitted by March 15, 1999, selection decisions will be made by April 12, 1999.

 For Type B cottage housing development applications submitted by July 1, 1999, selection decisions will be made by August 1, 1999.

 Section 5. Density Limits

 Contrary to the provisions in Section 6 of Ordinance 119241, departures may be granted from the maximum density limits allowed for the types of housing being demonstrated for Type B cottage housing development, as provided in this ordinance.

 Section 6. Program Reporting and Evaluation.

 Detached Accessory Dwelling Units. Evaluation criteria (a.) for Detached Accessory Dwelling Units contained in Section 7 (1) of Ordinance 119241 is deleted and replaced by the following: a. What are the appropriate development standards for detached ADUs that "fit" on a single family lot and within a single family neighborhood, but still allow the development of a livable unit? Is there a minimum lot size that would be appropriate? Should additional height above that currently allowed for accessory structures be allowed, and if so, should there be a maximum limit for the additional height? If additional height is allowed, should it be allowed outright or through the administrative Design Review procedure? Does the process through which it is approved make any difference in the amount of additional height that may be allowed?

 Type B Cottage Housing Demonstration Projects. The evaluation of Type B projects will include the following questions, instead of those questions listed in Ordinance 119241 for the evaluation of cottage housing development demonstration projects:

 Do the development standards already in the code for cottage housing developments, other than density limits, work for Type B cottage housing development? What development standards, including height, are appropriate for accessory structures? Should some standards be modified and if so, how?

 What was the cost of construction? How did the additional density affect the per unit cost of construction? Does the additional density result in more affordable units? What are the factors that help or hinder the affordability of this type of development?

 c. What do the neighbors think of this type of development? Is the number of units an issue with neighbors? What is the reaction of the residents of the housing in terms of livability of the unit and how it could be improved?

 d. If Design Review is to be used for this type of development, are additional design guidelines needed to address more directly the issues relevant to this type of single family development?

 e. Did this project provide a design concept that would likely be applicable and acceptable in other neighborhoods?

 f. What were the positive results of this project? What were the negative results?

 g. Were there any unintended consequences that need to be resolved?

 h. Are there certain neighborhoods or types of neighborhoods that are more appropriate for this type of development than others?

 Section 7. Subsection B of Section 23.40.050, which was enacted by Ordinance 119241, is hereby amended as follows:

 23.40.050 Demonstration Program for Innovative Housing Design

 Scope of Authority to Modify Land Use Code Requirements

 Demonstration projects shall be selected and reviewed in accordance with the Demonstration Program for Innovative Housing Design adopted by Ordinance 119241. Each demonstration project shall comply with all of the requirements of the Land Use Code otherwise applicable to the project, except as specified below:

 Each demonstration project, including single family development and redevelopment of existing structures, shall be reviewed through the Design Review process contained in SMC chapter 23.41 and in SMC chapter 23.76. Detached accessory dwelling unit projects selected in category one of the Demonstration Program shall use the administrative Design Review process at SMC 23.41.016.

 A maximum of ten (10) detached accessory dwelling units may be allowed in Single Family zones contrary to the requirement in SMC 23.44.006(A). For purposes of this ordinance, a "detached accessory dwelling unit" means an additional room or set of rooms that are located within a structure accessory to an owner- occupied single family structure, that is not connected to the principal structure and is designed, arranged, occupied or intended to be occupied by not more than one household as living accommodations independent from any other household. Such units must be developed according to the development standards for accessory structures and accessory dwelling units in Single Family zones, Sections 23.44.040 and 23.44.041, except that:

 Contrary to SMC 23.44.041 (A)(4) the accessory dwelling unit may be located in a structure that is detached from the single family dwelling that is the principal use on the lot; and

 Additional modifications to the development standards contained in SMC 23.44.040 and SMC 23.44.041 may be allowed as departures through the Design Review process under SMC Chapter 23.41.012; and

 In addition to the development standard departures allowed in Section 23.41.012, a departure may be allowed for additional height ~~if the accessory dwelling unit is a single story unit and will be located~~ up to a maximum of two stories, in order to accommodate detached accessory dwelling units in a single story unit above a detached garage and other detached accessory dwelling units of a similar height, provided that, no height departure may be granted that would result in a structure that is higher than the maximum allowed for single family structures in single family zones other than lots zoned Residential Small Lot.

 3. A maximum of ~~six (6)~~ten (10) projects that include cottage housing, tandem housing ~~and~~or small lot single family development may be allowed in a Single Family zone, contrary to the minimum lot area requirements of SMC 23.44.010 and other development standards contained in SMC 23.44. Such development must comply with the Residential Small Lot development standards, SMC Chapter 23.43, except that modifications to the development standards contained in SMC 23.43 may be allowed as departures through the Design Review process as follows: .

a. A maximum of six (6) of these projects will be designated as Type A projects. For these Type A projects,~~I~~ in addition to the development standard departures allowed under SMC 23.41.012, departures may also be allowed for:

~~a.~~(1) Additional height up to a maximum of fifteen (15) percent over the maximum allowed by SMC 23.43.012 for cottage housing, by SMC 23.43.010 for tandem housing and by SMC 23.43.008 for small lot single family development, provided that, no height departure may be granted that would result in a structure that is higher than the maximum allowed for single family structures in single family zones other than lots zoned Residential Small Lot.

~~b.~~(2) The maximum total floor area of each cottage as required by SMC 23.43.012D, as long as the maximum amount of total floor area for the entire cottage housing development is not increased.

b. A maximum of four (4) of these projects will be designated as Type B projects. For Type B projects, all of which must be in cottage housing developments, in addition to the development standard departures allowed under SMC 23.41.012 and the departures allowed pursuant to SMC 23.40.050(B)(3)(a) for Type A projects, departures may also be allowed:  (1)

(( f))For increased density beyond that allowed by SMC 23.43.012(B)(1) when

 (((1) T))the additional dwelling units are located above garages in accessory structures ((provided for dwelling units)) in the cottage housing development;, and the maximum increase in dwelling unit density allowed by this demonstration project is fifty percent (50%) above that allowed by the current density limits contained in SMC 23.43.012(b)(1); and

 (((2) The maximum number of above-garage units is one (1) for every two (2) cottage houses.)) (2) For additional height for accessory structures beyond the twelve feet (12') allowed by SMC 23.43.040 A.3, when the accessory structure contains a garage with above-garage dwelling units, up to a maximum of fifteen percent (15%) over the maximum allowed by SMC 23.43.012 C for principal structures in cottage housing developments, provided that no height departure may be granted that would result in an accessory structure that is higher than the maximum allowed for single family structures in single family zones other than lots zoned Residential Small Lot.

A maximum of six (6) multifamily demonstration projects in a multifamily zone or as part of a mixed-use development project in a commercial zone outside of downtown, may be granted height departures through the Design Review process, contrary to SMC 23.41 which, with one exception, does not allow height departures. A height departure of up to fifteen (15) percent over the maximum height limit of the zone, may be allowed as long as:

 No additional floors are constructed as a result of this additional height;

 The overall scale of development as viewed from the street front has generally not increased; and

 the structure is compatible with the neighborhood, and with the scale of development allowed in the zone.

 A height exception under SMC 23.47.008C3 or C4 will not be requested as part of the project; and

 If private views protected by SMC 23.47.008C4c will be blocked by the demonstration project, no additional height greater than the additional height that could be granted by a height exception under SMC 23.47.008C4c may be granted by a height departure under the demonstration program.

 5. A maximum of six (6) residential projects in an existing structure in multifamily or commercial zones outside of downtown, including mixed-use development, may use the Design Review process. Development standard departures currently allowed only for new development under SMC 23.41.012 may be granted for the redevelopment of these existing structures.

 Section 8. The provisions of this ordinance are declared to be separate and severable. The invalidity of any particular provision shall not affect the validity of any other provision.

 Section 9. Any act pursuant to the authority and prior to the effective date of this ordinance is hereby ratified and confirmed.

 Section 10. This ordinance shall take effect and be in force thirty (30) days from and after its approval by the Mayor, but if not approved and returned by the Mayor within ten (10) days after presentation, it shall take effect as provided by Municipal Code Section 1.04.020.
