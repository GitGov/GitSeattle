 ORDINANCE __________________

 AN ORDINANCE relating to the Executive Services Department (ESD), Technology Division; appropriating cable franchise fee revenues; increasing the expenditure allowance in that department's 1998 budget for the development of the HistoryLink web site; authorizing ESD to contract with History Ink; all by three-fourths vote of the City Council.

 WHEREAS, the arrival of the Denny Party on Alki Beach on November 13, 1851, marked an escalation in the development of Seattle, followed by the creation of King County by the Oregon Territorial Legislature on December 22, 1852; and

 WHEREAS, the sesquicentennials of these events, which fall in the years 2001 and 2002, create unique opportunities for historical research, reflection, and education; and

 WHEREAS, better public understanding of Seattle and King County's past, particularly among the young, can lay the foundation for more effective citizenship and community participation in the future; and

 WHEREAS, a broad-based and active community outreach can complement and improve upon conventional historical accounts, some of which tend to understate the roles and contributions of minorities, working people, small businesses, community groups, and ordinary citizens in local social, economic and cultural development; and

 WHEREAS, public celebration of the new millennium and the sesquicentennials of Seattle and King County should create resources and legacies of lasting value to future generations; and

 WHEREAS, Ordinance 118196 established a Sub-Fund in the General Fund, entitled Cable Television Franchise Sub-Fund, into which revenues from the Cable Franchise Fee are deposited; and

 WHEREAS, the City of Seattle's Public Access Network (PAN), includes information developed and maintained by many non-profit and community organizations that contribute to furthering the City's goals; and

 WHEREAS, sufficient cable franchise fee revenues from 1996 are available to cover the cost of this project;

 NOW THEREFORE,

 BE IT ORDAINED BY THE CITY OF SEATTLE AS FOLLOWS:

 Section 1. The expenditure allowance in the 1998 budget of the Executive Services Department, Technology Division (SFMS Code A44) is increased by the amount of Twenty Five Thousand Dollars ($25,000) to establish and support "HistoryLink," an interactive historical Web site on the City of Seattle's Public Access Network (PAN). For this purpose, the sum of Twenty Five Thousand Dollars ($25,000) is appropriated from the Cable Television Franchise Sub-Fund of the General Fund.

 Section 2. The Executive Services Department is authorized to execute a contract with History Ink, a non-profit corporation, for development of HistoryLink and related community outreach and training services. This contract shall include services related to community participation in historical research, outreach to under-represented groups and communities, and involvement of public schools and institutions of higher learning. The contract shall include the requirement that History Ink raise one dollar of matching money from non-City sources for every dollar received from the City. Both the matching fund dollars and the City funds received are to be used exclusively for this project.

 Section 3. History Ink shall be responsible for developing and maintaining all content on the HistoryLink portion of PAN. PAN will host the site and provide reasonable technical assistance and support for the site's development and maintenance. All content developed for and presented on HistoryLink under this contract shall be available to the public at no charge, but the site may also include proprietary materials, e.g., copyrighted photographs, obtained without cost to the City of Seattle.

 Section 4. The City will consider providing an additional $25,000 to this project in the 1999 Budget, provided that History Ink raises matching funds for the contract authorized herein., and for any subsequent appropriations from the City.

 Section 3. Any act consistent with the authority and prior to the effective date of this ordinance is hereby ratified and confirmed.

 Section 4. The foregoing appropriation is made to meet actual necessary expenditures of the City for which insufficient appropriation has been made due to causes which could not reasonably have been foreseen at the time of the adoption of the 1998 budget;

 This ordinance shall take effect and be in force thirty (30) days from and after its approval by the Mayor, but if not approved and returned by the Mayor within ten (10) days after presentation, it shall take effect as provided by Municipal Code Section 1.04.020.
