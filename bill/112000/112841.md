 In consideration of the mutual promises of the parties hereto and other good and valuable consideration, the receipt of which is hereby acknowledged, the Grantor and Grantee agree on behalf of themselves and their successors and assigns as follows:

 A G R E E M E N T S:

 1. Grant of Water Easement. Grantor hereby makes, declares, conveys and grants and establishes, for the benefit of the Benefited Property, a non-exclusive easement (the " Water Easement") on, over, under, across and within that portion of the Burdened Property generally shown on the attached Exhibit 3 and more particularly described on the attached Exhibit 4 (the "Water Easement Area") for connecting to, operating and using on a joint basis with Grantor and the any other owners of upstream property that certain water line, and any replacements thereof, located within the Water Easement Area (the "Common Water Line") and for installing, maintaining, operating, using, repairing and replacing a water line connecting the Benefited Property to the Common Water Line (the "Connecting Water Line") .

 2. Maintenance of Water Line. Grantor shall maintain the Common Water Line in good condition, repair and working order. The cost of maintenance, repair or reconstruction of the Common Water Line shall be shared equally by the parties hereto. Grantee shall, at its sole cost and expense, maintain in good condition, repair and working order, the Connecting Water Line. When it becomes necessary to repair, clean or reconstruct the Connecting Water Line, Grantee shall have a right of entry on the Burdened Property for that purpose.

 3. Term of Easement. The term of this Easement Agreement and the Water Easement shall commence as of the date of this Agreement and shall remain in full force and effect up to and through the Termination Date, which is defined as the earlier of the following dates: (a) the date the Space Needle is no longer open for business on the Benefited Property (excluding temporary business interruptions); and (b) the date on which Grantor terminates the Easement Agreement due to Grantee's default in accordance with, and subject to the limitations, set forth in Paragraph 10 below. Grantee, if it determines it no longer requires the benefit of the Water Easement, shall have the right to terminate this Easement Agreement and the Water Easement, upon advance written notice to Grantor, which notice shall specify the date on which such termination shall take effect (which date of termination shall be no sooner than ninety (90) days after the date of such notice).

Any Relocation shall only occur if such Relocation provides mutually agreed upon adequate, alternative Water service for the Space Needle, consistent with its then current use. Grantee shall not unreasonably withhold, delay or condition its agreement to a Relocation proposed by Grantor. Grantor and Grantee, at Grantor's expense and at the request of either party, shall prepare, execute, acknowledge and record such documents and instruments as are necessary to amend this Easement Agreement to reflect any Relocation pursuant to this Paragraph 4.

The indemnities granted hereby shall not apply to any losses, liabilities, claims, costs, actions or damages caused by the sole negligence of Grantee. In the event that any action is brought against Grantee by any employee of Grantor, the indemnification obligation of Grantor set forth in this Paragraph shall not be limited by a limit on the amount or type of damages, compensation or benefits payable by or for Grantor under RCW Title 51, the Industrial Insurance Act, or any other employee benefit act.

 8. No Interference with Grantee's Use of Easement. Grantor shall not take any actions or permit acts by third parties which would unreasonably interfere with the purpose of this Easement Agreement or would otherwise unreasonably impair or interfere with Grantee's use and enjoyment of the Common Water Line or the Connecting Water Line.

 EASEMENT AGREEMENT

 FOR INGRESS AND EGRESS

 (Lot 1)

 THIS EASEMENT AGREEMENT is executed as of this _____ day of ___________, 1999, by and between THE CITY OF SEATTLE, a municipal corporation of the State of Washington ("Grantor"), which is the owner of that parcel of real estate located in King County, Washington, and legally described in Exhibit 1 (the "Burdened Property") and SPACE NEEDLE CORPORATION, a Washington corporation ("Grantee"), which is the owner of that parcel of real estate located in King County, Washington, and legally described in Exhibit 2 (the "Benefited Property").

 In consideration of the mutual promises of the parties hereto and other good and valuable consideration, the receipt of which is hereby acknowledged, the Grantor and Grantee agree on behalf of themselves and their successors and assigns as follows:

 A G R E E M E N T S:

 1. Grant of Lot 1 Access Easement. Grantor hereby makes, declares, conveys and grants and establishes, for the benefit of the Benefited Property, a non-exclusive easement (the "Lot 1 Access Easement") on, over, under, across and within that portion of the Burdened Property generally shown on the attached Exhibit 3 and more particularly described on the attached Exhibit 4 (the "Lot 1 Access Easement Area") for establishing, using and operating the Lot 1 Access Easement Area as open space for the use and enjoyment of the public and for ingress and egress of visitors to and from the Space Needle together with the right to install, maintain, operate, repair and replace the landscaping and other improvements associated with such open space (the "Lot 1 Open Space Improvements"). The terms and conditions of this Easement Agreement supersede and replace those terms and provisions of Resolution 18785 of the Seattle City Council relating to the grant of ingress and egress rights over the Lot 1 Access Easement Area to the Space Needle.

 2. Maintenance and Construction Requirements for Improvements. As part consideration for the grant of the Lot 1 Access Easement, Grantee covenants that the Lot 1 Open Space Improvements shall be installed and maintained in accordance with plans and specifications approved by Grantor, at Grantee's sole cost and expense in a manner consistent with the landscaping and maintenance standards generally applicable to all tenants of the Seattle Center. If Grantor in the exercise of reasonable judgment determines that it must have the Lot 1 Open Space Improvements maintained in whole or in part by Grantor's employees either because of a decree of a judicial or administrative tribunal or as a result of a negotiated settlement and/or agreement with Grantor's employees and/or their bargaining representative, then, thirty (30) days after Grantee's receipt of written notice of such determination from Grantor, Grantee shall be relieved of any further maintenance obligations for the applicable Lot 1 Open Space Improvements (except for contributing towards maintenance costs and expenses as further described below and for providing Grantor with specifications for the level and schedule of maintenance which Grantee has been performing) and Grantor shall assume and become solely responsible for such Lot 1 Open Space Improvements maintenance obligations under this Agreement. In such event Grantor shall perform all maintenance in accordance with all standards and specifications established pursuant to this Agreement, and shall carry out the same level and schedule of maintenance as previously carried out by Grantee, unless the parties agree otherwise. In the event Grantor assumes any maintenance obligations pursuant to this paragraph, Grantee shall, on an annual basis, contribute toward the documented cost and expense of such maintenance performed by Grantor in an amount equal to the lesser of: (a) the costs and expenses incurred for the applicable year by Grantor in performing the maintenance obligations, on an annualized basis or (b) the costs and expenses incurred by Grantee in performing the maintenance obligations in the last full calendar year prior to Grantor's assumption of the maintenance obligations, provided that amounts paid pursuant to clause (b), above, shall be adjusted annually, to reflect increases in the total percentage change in the Consumer Price Index for all Urban Consumers in the Seattle-Tacoma-Bremerton Metropolitan Area ("CPI"), published by the U.S. Department of Labor, Bureau of Labor Statistics. To the extent the parties agree in writing that it is necessary or appropriate for maintenance and repair work to be carried out that is in addition to the level and schedule of maintenance established in the maintenance specifications, Grantor (or Grantee, if the parties so agree) shall carry out such additional maintenance or repair work and the cost of such additional maintenance or repair work shall be shared by the parties in accordance with the written agreement reached by the parties with respect to performance of such additional maintenance and repair work. Upon completion of construction and without the necessity for any further action by Grantee, all of the Lot 1 Open Space Improvements shall become the property of the Grantor.

 3. Term of Easement. The term of this Easement Agreement and the Lot 1 Access Easement shall commence as of the date of this Agreement and shall remain in full force and effect in perpetuity, unless and until the date the Space Needle is permanently demolished or ceases to be a civic center attraction generally open and available to the public, subject to such fees, rules and regulations that the Space Needle may impose in connection with admission to and use of its facilities, in which case this Easement Agreement shall be deemed terminated as of the date such demolition is completed or the date upon which the Space Needle ceases to be generally open and available as a civic center attraction to members of the public, subject to such fees, rules and regulations that the Space Needle may impose in connection with admission to and use of its facilities. In addition, Grantee, if it determines it no longer requires the benefit of the Lot 1 Access Easement, shall have the right to terminate this Easement Agreement and the Lot 1 Access Easement, upon advance written notice to Grantor, which notice shall specify the date on which such termination shall take effect (which date of termination shall be no sooner than ninety (90) days after the date of such notice).

 4. Indemnity. Grantee does hereby release and shall indemnify and hold Grantor harmless for, from and against all losses, liabilities, claims (including mechanics' or materialmen's liens), costs (including attorneys' fees), actions or damages of any sort or nature whatsoever incurred as a result of or arising out of Grantee's use of the Lot 1 Access Easement Area to the extent attributable to the negligent acts or omissions, willful misconduct or breach of this Easement Agreement by Grantee, its servants, agents, employees and contractors. If a loss, liability, claim, cost, action or damage subject to this Paragraph 4 is caused by the joint or concurrent negligence of Grantee and Grantor, Grantee and Grantor shall each be responsible for such loss, liability, claim, cost action or damage in proportion to their respective negligence in the matter. The indemnities granted hereby shall not apply to any losses, liabilities, claims, costs, actions or damages caused by the sole negligence of Grantor. In the event that any action is brought against Grantor by any employee of Grantee, the indemnification obligation of Grantee set forth in this Paragraph shall not be limited by a limit on the amount or type of damages, compensation or benefits payable by or for Grantee under RCW Title 51, the Industrial Insurance Act, or any other employee benefit act. In addition, as to actions arising out of work performed pursuant to this Easement Agreement and solely for the purpose of giving full effect to the indemnities contained herein and not for the benefit of Grantee's employees or any third parties, Grantee waives its immunity under RCW Title 51. Grantee acknowledges that this indemnification has been negotiated by the parties.

 5. Insurance. Grantee shall, at its own cost and expense, obtain and maintain in effect during the term of this Easement Agreement and shall ensure that each of its contractors maintain throughout the course of any construction activities undertaken on the Easement Areas commercial general liability insurance, written on an insurance industry standard occurrence form (CG0001) or equivalent, including all the usual coverages known as Premises/Operations Liability, Products/Completed Operations, Personal/Advertising Injury, Contractual Liability, Independent Contractors' Liability, and Stop Gap, and providing property damage and bodily injury liability coverage with limits not less than $1,000,000 each occurrence and $2,000,000 in the aggregate, for any damage, loss or injury resulting from Grantee's use of the Easement Areas or the activities of its contractors thereon. Grantee's insurance policies shall be primary to all other insurance of the Grantor, shall be rated A-:VII or higher in the A.M. Best's Key Rating Guide, shall be issued by a company licensed to do business in the State of Washington, and shall be subject to approval by Grantor's Risk Manager as to company, form and coverage. All insurance policies required under this Section 6 shall not be reduced or canceled without forty-five (45) days prior written notice to Grantor. Grantor shall be named as an additional insured on all such policies and shall receive as evidence of insurance a copy of each of the policy's declaration pages, showing the insuring company, effective dates, limits of liability, schedule of forms and endorsements, and the additional insured endorsement (ISO CG2026, or equivalent). Such declaration pages shall be due on the date of execution of this Easement Agreement with respect to the policy required of Grantee, and prior to commencement of any construction activities with respect to those policies required of Grantee's contractors. Grantor shall receive a renewal certificate or a certificate for a new policy meeting the foregoing requirements within thirty (30) days after the policy expiration date identified in the then last insurance certificate provided to Grantor.

 6. Liens; Taxes. Grantee covenants and agrees promptly to pay all sums legally due and payable by it on account of any work performed upon the Easement Areas and to keep Grantor's interest in the Burdened Property free and clear of all liens arising out of such work.

 7. No Interference with Grantee's Use of Easement. Grantor shall not take any actions or permit acts by third parties which would unreasonably interfere with the purpose of this Easement Agreement or would otherwise unreasonably impair or interfere with Grantee's use and enjoyment of the Lot 1 Access Easement.

 8. Covenant With the Land. The Lot 1 Access Easement granted herein and the rights and restrictions contained herein shall be covenants running with the land and shall be binding upon the Burdened Property and inure to the benefit of the Benefited Property.

 9. Grantor's Remedies Upon Grantee Default. In no event shall Grantor be entitled to terminate this Easement Agreement or the Lot 1 Access Easement granted herein as a result of any default or breach by Grantee of any representation, warranty or covenant hereunder.

If a loss, liability, claim, cost, action or damage subject to this Paragraph 4 is caused by the joint or concurrent negligence of Grantee and Grantor, Grantee and Grantor shall each be responsible for such loss, liability, claim, cost action or damage in proportion to their respective negligence in the matter. The indemnities granted hereby shall not apply to any losses, liabilities, claims, costs, actions or damages caused by the sole negligence of Grantor.

In addition, as to actions arising out of work performed pursuant to this Easement Agreement and solely for the purpose of giving full effect to the indemnities contained herein and not for the benefit of Grantee's employees or any third parties, Grantee waives its immunity under RCW Title 51. Grantee acknowledges that this indemnification has been negotiated by the parties.

 5. Insurance. Grantee shall, at its own cost and expense, obtain and maintain in effect during the term of this Easement Agreement and shall ensure that each of its contractors maintain throughout the course of any construction activities undertaken on the Easement Areas commercial general liability insurance, written on an insurance industry standard occurrence form (CG0001) or equivalent, including all the usual coverages known as Premises/Operations Liability, Products/Completed Operations, Personal/Advertising Injury, Contractual Liability, Independent Contractors' Liability, and Stop Gap, and providing property damage and bodily injury liability coverage with limits not less than $1,000,000 each occurrence and $2,000,000 in the aggregate, for any damage, loss or injury resulting from Grantee's use of the Easement Areas or the activities of its contractors thereon.

 6. No Interference with Grantee's Use of Easement. Grantor shall not take any actions or permit acts by third parties, which would unreasonably interfere with the purpose of this Space Needle Overhangs Easement Agreement or would otherwise unreasonably impair or interfere with Grantee's use and enjoyment of the Space Needle Overhangs Easement.

 EASEMENT AGREEMENT

 FOR PEDESTRIAN RAMP

 THIS EASEMENT AGREEMENT is executed as of this ____ day of ___________, 1999, by and between THE CITY OF SEATTLE, a municipal corporation of the State of Washington ("Grantor"), which is the owner of that parcel of real estate located in King County, Washington, and legally described in the attached Exhibit 1 (the "Burdened Property") and SPACE NEEDLE CORPORATION, a Washington corporation ("Grantee"), which is the owner of that parcel of real estate located in King County, Washington, and legally described in the attached Exhibit 2 (the "Benefited Property").

 In consideration of the mutual promises of the parties hereto and other good and valuable consideration, the receipt of which is hereby acknowledged, the Grantor and Grantee agree on behalf of themselves and their successors and assigns as follows:

 A G R E E M E N T S:

 1. Grant of Pedestrian Ramp Easement. Grantor hereby makes, declares, conveys and grants and establishes, for the benefit of the Benefited Property, a nonexclusive easement (the "Pedestrian Ramp Easement") on, over, under, across and within that portion of the Burdened Property generally shown on the attached Exhibit 3 and more particularly described on the attached Exhibit 4 (the "Pedestrian Ramp Easement Area") for ingress, egress and the installation, construction, use, operation, maintenance, repair, removal and replacement of a pedestrian ramp and reasonable ancillary improvements serving the Space Needle (collectively, the "Pedestrian Ramp Improvements").

 2. Construction and Maintenance Requirements for Pedestrian Ramp Improvements. Grantee shall have the right to construct, at its sole cost and expense, the Pedestrian Ramp Improvements in the Pedestrian Ramp Easement Area in accordance with plans and specifications approved by the Grantor. Grantee covenants that the Pedestrian Ramp Improvements shall be maintained in good condition and that any construction, repair or replacement of the Pedestrian Ramp Improvements shall be performed in a good and workmanlike manner and in compliance with such approved designs and with all applicable laws, regulations and rules (including the Seattle Center Construction Guidelines generally applicable to all tenants).

 3. Annual Easement Fees.

 a. Commencing on October 1, 2009, and thereafter on each October 1 during the term of this Easement Agreement, an annual easement fee equal to 8% of the fair market value of the Pedestrian Ramp Easement Area shall be due and payable to Grantor by Grantee, in advance, for the right to use the Pedestrian Ramp Easement Area in accordance with the terms of this Easement Agreement (the "Pedestrian Ramp Easement Fee"). For purposes of all calculations of the Pedestrian Ramp Easement Fee, the parties agree that the Pedestrian Ramp Easement Area contains 2,286 square feet. For calendar year 1999, the parties agree that the fair market value is Fifty-five Dollars ($55.00) per square foot, resulting in the amount of $10,058.40, and such amount shall be subject to annual CPI adjustment in the manner described in Section 3(b) below for purposes of calculating the Pedestrian Ramp Easement Fee first due on October 1, 2009. The Pedestrian Ramp Easement Fee shall be paid by check payable to the City of Seattle and shall be sent to Grantor in care of Seattle Center Accounts Receivable, 305 Harrison Avenue, Seattle, WA 98109, or such other place as may be designated from time to time in writing by Grantor. Grantee shall pay interest on all overdue Pedestrian Ramp Easement Fees at the rate of twelve percent (12%) per annum from the date when said sum becomes due until the date it is paid in full.

 b. The Pedestrian Ramp Easement Fee shall be annually adjusted upward effective on October 1, 2010 and each October 1 thereafter (each, a "Fee Adjustment Date") to reflect increases in the total percentage change in the Consumer Price Index for all Urban Consumers in the Seattle-Tacoma-Bremerton Metropolitan Area ("CPI"), published by the U.S. Department of Labor, Bureau of Labor Statistics. Grantor shall notify Grantee in writing at least three (3) months prior to each Fee Adjustment Date of the new Pedestrian Ramp Easement Fees that will be due starting on such Fee Adjustment Date. By way of example only, if the CPI on October 1, 2009 is 100 and the CPI as of July 1, 2010 is 110 and the Pedestrian Ramp Easement Fee due under this Easement Agreement immediately prior to the Fee Adjustment Date is $5,000, then the CPI-based fee adjustment would be 10% and the Pedestrian Ramp Easement Fee would increase to $5,500 effective for the period from October 1, 2010 through September 30, 2011, and if, in that following year, the CPI as of July 2, 2011 is 115, then the next C PI-based fee adjustment would be 4.55% and the Pedestrian Ramp Easement Fee would increase to $5,750 effective for the period from October 1, 2011 through September 30, 2012. In the event the CPI is discontinued, the parties shall agree upon another similar index to be used to calculate the contemplated adjustments, and in the event of an inability to agree, the parties shall request the American Arbitration Association or its successor to appoint a qualified arbitrator to establish an appropriate adjustment standard.

 c. There shall be an option exercisable one time for each five (5) year period during the term of the Agreement, with the first five (5) year period commencing October 1, 2009 and ending September 30, 2014, to have the fair market value of the Pedestrian Ramp Easement Area reappraised and the Pedestrian Ramp Easement Fee adjusted to equal eight percent (8%) of the reappraised fair market value of the Pedestrian Ramp Easement Area (the "Reappraisal Option"). Either Grantor or Grantee may exercise the Reappraisal Option for any of the five (5) year periods specified above, subject to the following limitations: (a) the applicable Reappraisal Option for a five (5) year period may only be exercised during such five (5) year period and the one (1) year immediately prior to such five (5) year period, (b) once one party has exercised the applicable Reappraisal Option for a five (5) year period, neither party shall have any further right to exercise a Reappraisal Option during such five-year period, and (c) if one party sends the other party written notice inquiring as to whether the other party intends to exercise the Reappraisal Option for the then current five (5) year period, the party sending the inquiry notice is barred from exercising the applicable Reappraisal Option for such five (5) year period and the party receiving the inquiry notice is also barred from exercising the applicable Reappraisal Option for such five (5) year period unless the receiving party exercises the Reappraisal Option within thirty (30) days after receipt of the inquiry notice. Subject to the foregoing limitations, a party can exercise a Reappraisal Option by simply delivering written notice of its exercise of the Reappraisal Option to the other party. Upon delivery of the exercise notice, the parties shall proceed to determine the fair market value of the Pedestrian Ramp Easement Area in the manner described below. Any adjustment in the Pedestrian Ramp Easement Fee resulting from the exercise of the Reappraisal Option shall first take effect as of the first October 1 occurring after the date upon which the fair market value of the Pedestrian Ramp Easement Area is finally determined in accordance with the procedures outlined below. The term "fair market value" of the Pedestrian Ramp Easement Area shall mean the price that a commercially-reasonable purchaser, who is willing but not obligated to purchase the land comprising the Pedestrian Ramp Easement Area, would be willing to pay for such land in an unimproved state to an owner willing but not obligated to sell it, as determined jointly by Grantor and Grantee, taking into consideration all uses for which the land was suited and might be applied, and assuming the land was owned by a private seller. If the parties cannot agree upon the fair market value of the land by the date that is thirty (30) days after a party has given notice of its exercise of the Reappraisal Option, then the parties shall agree within fifteen (15) days thereafter on one real estate appraiser (who shall be a member of the American Institute of Real Estate Appraisers, or equivalent) who will determine the fair market value of the land. If the parties cannot mutually agree upon an appraiser, then one M.A.I. qualified appraiser shall be appointed by Grantor and one M.A.I. qualified appraiser shall be appointed by Grantee within thirty (30) days of notice by one party to the other of such disagreement. The two appraisers shall determine the fair market value of the land; provided, however, if either party fails to appoint an appraiser within such thirty (30) day period, then the conclusion of the appraiser first appointed shall be final, conclusive and binding upon both parties. The appraiser(s) appointed shall proceed to determine fair market value within sixty (60) days following such appointment. The conclusion shall be final, conclusive and binding upon both parties. If said appraisers should fail to agree, but the difference in their conclusions as to fair market value is ten percent (10%) or less of the lower of the two appraisals, the fair market value shall be deemed the average of the two.

 If the two appraisers should fail to agree on the fair market value, and the difference between the two appraisals exceeds ten percent (10%), then the two appraisers thus appointed shall appoint a third M.A.I. qualified appraiser, and in case of their failure to agree on a third appraiser within thirty (30) days after their individual determination of the fair market value, either party may apply to the Presiding Judge of the King County Superior Court, requesting said Judge to appoint the third M.A.I. qualified appraiser. The third appraiser so appointed shall determine the fair market value of the land and the average of the fair market values stated in the two closest appraisals shall be deemed the fair market value for the purpose of this subparagraph 3.c. The costs and expenses of said third appraiser or the one appraiser the parties agree upon, shall be borne equally by the parties. The parties shall pay the fees and expenses of their respective appraisers if the parties fail to agree on a single appraiser. All M.A.I. appraisers appointed or selected pursuant to this Section shall have at least ten- (10) years experience appraising properties in the Seattle, Washington, area.

 4. Term of Easement. The term of this Easement Agreement and the Pedestrian Ramp Easement shall commence as of the date of this Agreement and shall remain in full force and effect up to and through the Termination Date, which is defined as the earlier of the following dates: (a) the date the Space Needle is no longer open for business on the Benefited Property (excluding temporary business interruptions); and (b) the date on which Grantor terminates the Easement Agreement due to Grantee's default in accordance with, and subject to the limitations, set forth in Paragraph 11 below. In addition, Grantee, if it determines it no longer requires the benefit of the Pedestrian Ramp Easement, shall have the right to terminate this Easement Agreement. Upon termination of this Easement Agreement, Grantee shall, at its sole cost and expense, remove the Pedestrian Ramp Improvements and restore the site to open space conditions consistent with adjacent areas and Seattle Center site standards.

 5. Indemnity. Grantee does hereby release and shall indemnify and hold Grantor harmless for, from and against all losses, liabilities, claims (including mechanics' or materialmen's liens), costs (including attorneys' fees), actions or damages of any sort or nature whatsoever incurred as a result of or arising out of Grantee's use of the Pedestrian Ramp Easement Area to the extent attributable to the negligent acts or omissions, willful misconduct or breach of this Easement Agreement by Grantee, its servants, agents, employees and contractors. If a loss, liability, claim, cost, action or damage subject to this Paragraph 5 is caused by the joint or concurrent negligence of Grantee and Grantor, Grantee and Grantor shall each be responsible for such loss, liability, claim, cost action or damage in proportion to their respective negligence in the matter. The indemnities granted hereby shall not apply to any losses, liabilities, claims, costs, actions or damages caused by the sole negligence of Grantor. In the event that any action is brought against Grantor by any employee of Grantee, the indemnification obligation of Grantee set forth in this Paragraph shall not be limited by a limit on the amount or type of damages, compensation or benefits payable by or for Grantee under RCW Title 51, the Industrial Insurance Act, or any other employee benefit act. In addition, as to actions arising out of work performed pursuant to this Easement Agreement and solely for the purpose of giving full effect to the indemnities contained herein and not for the benefit of Grantee's employees or any third parties, Grantee waives its immunity under RCW Title 51. Grantee acknowledges that this indemnification has been negotiated by the parties.

 6. Insurance. Grantee shall, at its own cost and expense, obtain and maintain in effect during the term of this Easement Agreement and shall ensure that each of its contractors maintain throughout the course of any construction activities undertaken on the Pedestrian Ramp Easement Area commercial general liability insurance, written on an insurance industry standard occurrence form (CG0001) or equivalent, including all the usual coverages known as Premises/Operations Liability, Products/Completed Operations, Personal/Advertising Injury, Contractual Liability, Independent Contractors' Liability, and Stop Gap, and providing property damage and bodily injury liability coverage with limits not less than $1,000,000 each occurrence and $2,000,000 in the aggregate, for any damage, loss or injury resulting from Grantee's use of the Pedestrian Ramp Easement Area or the activities of its contractors thereon. If the construction activities involve significant excavation or digging, then the policies required of Grantee's contractors under this Section 6 shall include an explosion, collapse and underground endorsement. Grantee's insurance policies shall be primary to all other insurance of the Grantor, shall be rated A-:VII or higher in the A.M. Best's Key Rating Guide, shall be issued by a company licensed to do business in the State of Washington, and shall be subject to approval by Grantor's Risk Manager as to company, form and coverage. All insurance policies required under this Section 6 shall not be reduced or canceled without forty-five (45) days prior written notice to Grantor. Grantor shall be named as an additional insured on all such policies and shall receive as evidence of insurance a copy of each of the policy's declaration pages, showing the insuring company, effective dates, limits of liability, schedule of forms and endorsements, and the additional insured endorsement (ISO CG2026, or equivalent). Such declaration pages shall be due on the date of execution of this Easement Agreement with respect to the policy required of Grantee, and prior to commencement of any construction activities with respect to those policies required of Grantee's contractors. Grantor shall receive a renewal certificate or a certificate for a new policy meeting the foregoing requirements within thirty (30) days after the policy expiration date identified in the then last insurance certificate provided to Grantor.

 7. No Interference with Grantee's Use of Easement. Grantor shall not take any actions or permit acts by third parties, which would unreasonably interfere with the purpose of this Easement Agreement or would otherwise unreasonably impair or interfere with Grantee's use and enjoyment of the Pedestrian Ramp Easement.

 8. Liens; Taxes. Grantee covenants and agrees promptly to pay all sums legally due and payable by it on account of any work performed upon the Pedestrian Ramp Easement Area and to keep Grantor's interest in the Burdened Property free and clear of all liens arising out of such work.

 9. As-Built Location. The parties acknowledge that in the course of construction despite Grantee's reasonable efforts or as a result of design changes approved by Grantor, the precise location of the Pedestrian Ramp Improvements, once constructed, may not perfectly coincide with the legal description of the Pedestrian Ramp Easement Area established by Exhibit 4. To the extent such discrepancies are non-material or were a result of design changes approved by Grantor, at the request of either party made after construction of the Pedestrian Ramp Improvements is completed, an amendment to this Easement Agreement shall be prepared, executed, acknowledged and recorded by the parties to amend the legal description of the Pedestrian Ramp Easement Area to reflect the actual as-built location of the applicable Pedestrian Ramp Improvements. To the extent the determination of the as-built location of the Pedestrian Ramp Improvements for the Pedestrian Ramp Easement reveals that the actual area occupied by the Pedestrian Ramp Improvements for the Pedestrian Ramp Area contains more or less square feet than the number specified in Section 3.a., the same amendment to this Easement Agreement, which amends the legal description of the Pedestrian Ramp Easement Area, shall also amend the number specified in Section 3.a. and proportionately adjust the Pedestrian Ramp Easement Fee. Grantee shall provide a survey or other documentation establishing the actual as-built location of the Pedestrian Ramp Improvements upon completion.

 10. Covenant With the Land. The Easement granted herein and the rights and restrictions contained herein shall be a covenant running with the land and shall be binding upon the Burdened Property and inure to the benefit of the Benefited Property.

 11. Grantor's Remedies Upon Grantee Default. Grantor shall only be entitled to terminate this Easement Agreement as a result of any default or breach by Grantee of any representation, warranty or covenant hereunder if (a) Grantor has given written notice of such default to Grantee and (b) Grantee has failed to cure such default within sixty (60) days of receipt of such written notice of default (or if the cure is not reasonably susceptible to cure within such sixty (60) day period, Grantee has commenced the cure within such sixty (60) day period and thereafter diligently pursues the cure to completion). Subject to the foregoing limitation, Grantor shall be entitled to pursue any and all other any right or remedy available at law or in equity for such default or breach by Grantee, including without limitation an action for specific performance, injunctive relief or actual damages.

 12. Notices. All notices required to be given hereunder shall be given in writing and shall be deemed delivered on the date of hand delivery of the notice or the date that is three days after mailing of the notice by certified or registered mail, return receipt, postage prepaid, to the parties at the addresses set forth below:

 EASEMENT AGREEMENT FOR SEWER LINE

 THIS EASEMENT AGREEMENT is executed as of this _____ day of ___________, 1999, by and between THE CITY OF SEATTLE, a municipal corporation of the State of Washington ("Grantor"), which is the owner of that parcel of real estate located in King County, Washington, and legally described in the attached Exhibit 1 (the "Burdened Property") and SPACE NEEDLE CORPORATION, a Washington corporation ("Grantee"), which is the owner of that parcel of real estate located in King County, Washington, and legally described in the attached Exhibit 2 (the "Benefited Property").

 In consideration of the mutual promises of the parties hereto and other good and valuable consideration, the receipt of which is hereby acknowledged, the Grantor and Grantee agree on behalf of themselves and their successors and assigns as follows:

 A G R E E M E N T S:

 1. Grant of Sewer Easement. Grantor hereby makes, declares, conveys and grants and establishes, for the benefit of the Benefited Property, a non-exclusive easement (the " Sewer Easement") on, over, under, across and within that portion of the Burdened Property generally shown on the attached Exhibit 3 and more particularly described on the attached Exhibit 4 (the "Sewer Easement Area") for connecting to, operating and using on a joint basis with Grantor and the any other owners of upstream property that certain combined (sanitary/storm) sewer line, and any replacements thereof, located within the Sewer Easement Area (the "Common Sewer Line") and for installing, maintaining, operating, using, repairing and replacing a sewer line connecting the Benefited Property to the Common Sewer Line (the "Connecting Sewer Line") .

 2. Maintenance of Sewer Line. Grantor shall maintain the Common Sewer Line in good condition, repair and working order. The cost of maintenance, repair or reconstruction of the Common Sewer Line shall be shared equally by the parties hereto. Grantee shall, at its sole cost and expense, maintain in good condition, repair and working order, the Connecting Sewer Line. When it becomes necessary to repair, clean or reconstruct the Connecting Sewer Line, Grantee shall have a right of entry on the Burdened Property for that purpose.

 3. Term of Easement. The term of this Easement Agreement and the Sewer Easement shall commence as of the date of this Agreement and shall remain in full force and effect up to and through the Termination Date, which is defined as the earlier of the following dates: (a) the date the Space Needle is no longer open for business on the Benefited Property (excluding temporary business interruptions); and (b) the date on which Grantor terminates the Easement Agreement due to Grantee's default in accordance with, and subject to the limitations, set forth in Paragraph 10 below. Grantee, if it determines it no longer requires the benefit of the Sewer Easement, shall have the right to terminate this Easement Agreement and the Sewer Easement, upon advance written notice to Grantor, which notice shall specify the date on which such termination shall take effect (which date of termination shall be no sooner than ninety (90) days after the date of such notice).

 4. Relocation of Easement. Subject to the conditions set forth in this Paragraph 4, Grantor shall have the right, at its sole cost and expense, to relocate the Common Sewer Line, the Connecting Sewer Line and/or the Sewer Easement Area or to modify its size and/or dimensions (hereinafter, a "Relocation"). Any Relocation shall only occur if such Relocation provides mutually agreed upon adequate, alternative sewer service for the Space Needle, consistent with its then current use. Grantee shall not unreasonably withhold, delay or condition its agreement to a Relocation proposed by Grantor. Grantor and Grantee, at Grantor's expense and at the request of either party, shall prepare, execute, acknowledge and record such documents and instruments as are necessary to amend this Easement Agreement to reflect any Relocation pursuant to this Paragraph 4.

 5. Indemnity.

 a.

 EASEMENT AGREEMENT FOR INGRESS AND EGRESS

 (Portion of Vacated Thomas Street)

 THIS EASEMENT AGREEMENT is executed as of this _____ day of ___________, 1999, by and between THE CITY OF SEATTLE, a municipal corporation of the State of Washington ("Grantor"), which is the owner of that parcel of real estate located in King County, Washington, and legally described in the attached Exhibit 1 (the "Burdened Property") and SPACE NEEDLE CORPORATION, a Washington corporation ("Grantee"), which is the owner of that parcel of real estate located in King County, Washington, and legally described in the attached Exhibit 2 (the "Benefited Property").

 In consideration of the mutual promises of the parties hereto and other good and valuable consideration, the receipt of which is hereby acknowledged, the Grantor and Grantee agree on behalf of themselves and their successors and assigns as follows:

 A G R E E M E N T S:

 1. Grant of Thomas Street Access Easement. Grantor hereby makes, declares, conveys and grants and establishes, for the benefit of the Benefited Property, a non-exclusive easement (the "Thomas Street Access Easement") on, over, under, across and within that portion of the Burdened Property generally shown on the attached Exhibit 3 and more particularly described on the attached Exhibit 4 (the "Thomas Street Access Easement Area") for constructing, establishing, using and operating the Thomas Street Access Easement Area as open space for the use and enjoyment of the public and for ingress and egress of visitors to and from the Space Needle together with the right to install, maintain, operate, repair and replace the landscaping and other improvements associated with such open space (the "Thomas Street Open Space Improvements").

 2. Maintenance and Construction Requirements for Improvements. As part consideration for the grant of the Thomas Street Access Easement, Grantee covenants that the Thomas Street Open Space Improvements shall be installed and maintained in accordance with plans and specifications approved by Grantor, at Grantee's sole cost and expense in a manner consistent with the landscaping and maintenance standards generally applicable to all tenants of the Seattle Center. If Grantor in the exercise of reasonable judgment determines that it must have the Thomas Street Open Space Improvements maintained in whole or in part by Grantor's employees either because of a decree of a judicial or administrative tribunal or as a result of a negotiated settlement and/or agreement with Grantor's employees and/or their bargaining representative, then, thirty (30) days after Grantee's receipt of written notice of such determination from Grantor, Grantee shall be relieved of any further maintenance obligations for the applicable Thomas Street Open Space Improvements (except for contributing towards maintenance costs and expenses as further described below and for providing Grantor with specifications for the level and schedule of maintenance which Grantee has been performing) and Grantor shall assume and become solely responsible for such Thomas Street Open Space Improvements maintenance obligations under this Agreement. In such event Grantor shall perform all maintenance in accordance with all standards and specifications established pursuant to this Agreement, and shall carry out the same level and schedule of maintenance as previously carried out by Grantee, unless the parties agree otherwise. In the event Grantor assumes any maintenance obligations pursuant to this paragraph, Grantee shall, on an annual basis, contribute toward the documented cost and expense of such maintenance performed by Grantor in an amount equal to the lesser of: (a) the costs and expenses incurred for the applicable year by Grantor in performing the maintenance obligations, on an annualized basis or (b) the costs and expenses incurred by Grantee in performing the maintenance obligations in the last full calendar year prior to Grantor's assumption of the maintenance obligations, provided that amounts paid pursuant to clause (b), above, shall be adjusted annually, to reflect increases in the total percentage change in the Consumer Price Index for all Urban Consumers in the Seattle-Tacoma-Bremerton Metropolitan Area ("CPI"), published by the U.S. Department of Labor, Bureau of Labor Statistics. To the extent the parties agree in writing that it is necessary or appropriate for maintenance and repair work to be carried out that is in addition to the level and schedule of maintenance established in the maintenance specifications, Grantor (or Grantee, if the parties so agree) shall carry out such additional maintenance or repair work and the cost of such additional maintenance or repair work shall be shared by the parties in accordance with the written agreement reached by the parties with respect to performance of such additional maintenance and repair work. Grantee further covenants that any construction, repair or replacement of the Thomas Street Open Space Improvements shall be performed in a good and workmanlike manner and in compliance with all applicable laws, regulations and rules (including the Seattle Center Construction Guidelines generally applicable to all tenants). Upon completion of construction and without the necessity for any further action by Grantee, all of the Thomas Street Open Space Improvements shall become the property of the Grantor.

 3. Term of Easement. The term of this Easement Agreement and the Thomas Street Access Easement shall commence as of the date of this Agreement and shall remain in full force and effect up to and through the Termination Date, which is defined as the earlier of the following dates: (a) the date the Space Needle is no longer open for business on the Benefited Property (excluding temporary business interruptions); and (b) the date on which Grantor terminates the Easement Agreement due to Grantee's default in accordance with, and subject to the limitations, set forth in Paragraph 10 below. Grantee, if it determines it no longer requires the benefit of the Thomas Street Access Easement, shall have the right to terminate this Easement Agreement and the Thomas Street Access Easement, upon advance written notice to Grantor, which notice shall specify the date on which such termination shall take effect (which date of termination shall be no sooner than ninety (90) days after the date of such notice).

 4. Relocation of Easement. No sooner than ten (10) years after the date of this Easement Agreement, and subject to the conditions set forth in this Paragraph 4, Grantor shall have the right to relocate the Thomas Street Access Easement Area or to modify its size and/or dimensions. Any relocation of the Thomas Street Access Easement Area shall only occur if such relocation or changed Thomas Street Access Easement Area provides mutually agreed upon adequate, alternative ingress and egress for the Space Needle visitors, consistent with its then current use. Grantee shall not unreasonably withhold, delay or condition its agreement to alternative ingress and egress proposed by Grantor. Grantor and Grantee, at Grantor's expense and at the request of either party, shall prepare, execute, acknowledge and record such documents and instruments as are necessary to amend this Easement Agreement to reflect any relocation or change to the Thomas Street Access Easement Area pursuant to this Paragraph 4.

 5. Indemnity. Grantee does hereby release and shall indemnify and hold Grantor harmless for, from and against all losses, liabilities, claims (including mechanics' or materialmen's liens), costs (including attorneys' fees), actions or damages of any sort or nature whatsoever incurred as a result of or arising out of Grantee's use of the Thomas Street Access Easement Area to the extent attributable to the negligent acts or omissions, willful misconduct or breach of this Easement Agreement by Grantee, its servants, agents, employees and contractors. If a loss, liability, claim, cost, action or damage subject to this Paragraph 5 is caused by the joint or concurrent negligence of Grantee and Grantor, Grantee and Grantor shall each be responsible for such loss, liability, claim, cost action or damage in proportion to their respective negligence in the matter. The indemnities granted hereby shall not apply to any losses, liabilities, claims, costs, actions or damages caused by the sole negligence of Grantor. In the event that any action is brought against Grantor by any employee of Grantee, the indemnification obligation of Grantee set forth in this Paragraph shall not be limited by a limit on the amount or type of damages, compensation or benefits payable by or for Grantee under RCW Title 51, the Industrial Insurance Act, or any other employee benefit act. In addition, as to actions arising out of work performed pursuant to this Easement Agreement and solely for the purpose of giving full effect to the indemnities contained herein and not for the benefit of Grantee's employees or any third parties, Grantee waives its immunity under RCW Title 51. Grantee acknowledges that this indemnification has been negotiated by the parties.

 6. Insurance. Grantee shall, at its own cost and expense, obtain and maintain in effect during the term of this Easement Agreement and shall ensure that each of its contractors maintain throughout the course of any construction activities undertaken on the Easement Areas commercial general liability insurance, written on an insurance industry standard occurrence form (CG0001) or equivalent, including all the usual coverages known as Premises/Operations Liability, Products/Completed Operations, Personal/Advertising Injury, Contractual Liability, Independent Contractors' Liability, and Stop Gap, and providing property damage and bodily injury liability coverage with limits not less than $1,000,000 each occurrence and $2,000,000 in the aggregate, for any damage, loss or injury resulting from Grantee's use of the Easement Areas or the activities of its contractors thereon. Grantee's insurance policies shall be primary to all other insurance of the Grantor, shall be rated A-:VII or higher in the A.M. Best's Key Rating Guide, shall be issued by a company licensed to do business in the State of Washington, and shall be subject to approval by Grantor's Risk Manager as to company, form and coverage. All insurance policies required under this Section 6 shall not be reduced or canceled without forty-five (45) days prior written notice to Grantor. Grantor shall be named as an additional insured on all such policies and shall receive as evidence of insurance a copy of each of the policy's declaration pages, showing the insuring company, effective dates, limits of liability, schedule of forms and endorsements, and the additional insured endorsement (ISO CG2026, or equivalent). Such declaration pages shall be due on the date of execution of this Easement Agreement with respect to the policy required of Grantee, and prior to commencement of any construction activities with respect to those policies required of Grantee's contractors. Grantor shall receive a renewal certificate or a certificate for a new policy meeting the foregoing requirements within thirty (30) days after the policy expiration date identified in the then last insurance certificate provided to Grantor.

 7. Liens; Taxes. Grantee covenants and agrees promptly to pay all sums legally due and payable by it on account of any work performed upon the Thomas Street Access Easement Area and to keep Grantor's interest in the Burdened Property free and clear of all liens arising out of such work.

 8. No Interference with Grantee's Use of Easement. Grantor shall not take any actions or permit acts by third parties, which would unreasonably interfere with the purpose of this Easement Agreement or would otherwise unreasonably impair or interfere with Grantee's use and enjoyment of the Thomas Street Access Easement.

 9. Covenant With the Land. The Thomas Street Access Easement granted herein and the rights and restrictions contained herein shall be covenants running with the land and shall be binding upon the Burdened Property and inure to the benefit of the Benefited Property.

 10. Grantor's Remedies Upon Grantee Default. Grantor shall only be entitled to terminate this Easement Agreement as a result of any default or breach by Grantee of any representation, warranty or covenant hereunder if (a) Grantor has given written notice of such default to Grantee and (b) Grantee has failed to cure such default within sixty (60) days of receipt of such written notice of default (or if the cure is not reasonably susceptible to cure within such sixty (60) day period, Grantee has commenced the cure within such sixty (60) day period and thereafter diligently pursues the cure to completion). Subject to the foregoing limitation, Grantor shall be entitled to pursue any and all other any right or remedy available at law or in equity for such default or breach by Grantee, including without limitation an action for specific performance, injunctive relief or actual damages.

 11. Notices. All notices required to be given hereunder shall be given in writing and shall be deemed delivered on the date of hand delivery of the notice or the date that is three days after mailing of the notice by certified or registered mail, return receipt, postage prepaid, to the parties at the addresses set forth below:

 EASEMENT AGREEMENT

 FOR TRUCK LOADING

 THIS EASEMENT AGREEMENT is executed as of this ____ day of ___________, 1999, by and between THE CITY OF SEATTLE, a municipal corporation of the State of Washington ("Grantor"), which is the owner of that parcel of real estate located in King County, Washington, and legally described in the attached Exhibit 1 (the "Burdened Property") and SPACE NEEDLE CORPORATION, a Washington corporation ("Grantee"), which is the owner of that parcel of real estate located in King County, Washington, and legally described in the attached Exhibit 2 (the "Benefited Property").

 In consideration of the mutual promises of the parties hereto and other good and valuable consideration, the receipt of which is hereby acknowledged, the Grantor and Grantee agree on behalf of themselves and their successors and assigns as follows:

 A G R E E M E N T S:

 1. Grant of Truck Loading Easement. Grantor hereby makes, declares, conveys and grants and establishes, for the benefit of the Benefited Property, (a) an exclusive easement (the "Exclusive Truck Loading Easement") on, over, under, across and within that portion of the Burdened Property generally shown on the attached Exhibit 3 and more particularly described on the attached Exhibit 4 (the "Exclusive Truck Loading Easement Area") and (b) a non-exclusive easement (the "Non-Exclusive Truck Loading Easement") on, over, under, across and within that portion of the Burdened Property generally shown on the attached Exhibit 3 and more particularly described on Exhibit 5 (the "Non-Exclusive Truck Loading Easement Area"). Both the Exclusive Truck Loading Easement and the Non-Exclusive Truck Loading Easement are being granted to the Grantee for the loading, unloading and temporary parking of trucks and, with respect to the Exclusive Truck Loading Easement Area only, for the siting and operation of power generation equipment and facilities serving the Space Needle (the "Truck Loading Activities") and for the constructing, establishing, using, operating, maintaining, repairing, removing and replacing of any improvements reasonably related to the Truck Loading Activities (the "Truck Loading Improvements"). The Exclusive Truck Loading Easement and the Non-Exclusive Truck Loading Easement are sometimes hereinafter referred to collectively as the "Easements." The Exclusive Truck Loading Easement Area and the Non- Exclusive Truck Loading Easement Area are sometimes hereinafter referred to collectively as the "Easement Areas." In addition to the Easements, upon vacation of Thomas Street, which public right-of-way abuts the Benefited Property, Grantor shall make available to the Benefited Property the same non-exclusive truck access and utility rights that Grantor makes available to tenants of the Seattle Center and which are necessary for Grantee to conduct its business operations.

 2. Construction and Maintenance Requirements for Truck Loading Improvements on Easement Areas. Grantee shall have the right to construct, at its sole cost and expense, as part of the Truck Loading Improvements, loading dock facilities in the Exclusive Truck Loading Easement Area and a driveway in the Non-Exclusive Truck Loading Easement Area and such other improvements reasonably related to the Truck Loading Activities, all in accordance with plans and specifications approved by the Grantor. In addition, Grantee shall have the right to install, as part of the Truck Loading Improvements, fences, gates and/or other security measures to secure the Exclusive Truck Loading Easement Area from members of the general public, provided, however, the design and location of such security measures shall be subject to Grantor's prior written consent, which shall not be unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned. Grantee covenants that the Truck Loading Improvements shall be maintained in good condition and that any construction, repair or replacement of the Truck Loading Improvements shall be performed in a good and workmanlike manner and in compliance with such approved designs and with all applicable laws, regulations and rules (including the Seattle Center Construction Guidelines generally applicable to all tenants). As part consideration for the grant of the Easements, Grantee agrees to install at its expense the landscaping for the area abutting the Easement Areas. Grantor shall thereafter be responsible for maintaining that portion of such landscaping located on Grantor's property, except that Grantee, during the term of this Agreement, shall maintain the landscaping located within the Exclusive Truck Loading Easement Area.

 3. Annual Easement Fees.

 a. Commencing on October 1, 1999, and thereafter on each October 1 during the term of this Easement Agreement, an annual easement fee equal to 8% of the fair market value of the Exclusive Truck Loading Easement Area shall be due and payable to Grantor by Grantee, in advance, for the right to use the Exclusive Truck Loading Easement Area in accordance with the terms of this Easement Agreement (the "Exclusive Truck Loading Easement Fee"). For purposes of all calculations of the Exclusive Truck Loading Easement Fee, the parties agree that the Exclusive Truck Loading Easement Area contains 4427 square feet. For calendar year 1999, the parties agree that the fair market value is Fifty-five Dollars ($55.00) per square foot, resulting in an initial payment of $19,478.80. The Exclusive Truck Loading Easement Fee shall be paid by check payable to the City of Seattle and shall be sent to Grantor in care of Seattle Center Accounts Receivable, 305 Harrison Avenue, Seattle, WA 98109, or such other place as may be designated from time to time in writing by Grantor. Grantee shall pay interest on all overdue Exclusive Truck Loading Easement Fees at the rate of twelve percent (12%) per annum from the date when said sum becomes due until the date it is paid in full.

 b. The Exclusive Truck Loading Easement Fee shall be annually adjusted upward effective on October 1, 2000, and each October 1 thereafter (each, a "Fee Adjustment Date") to reflect increases in the total percentage change in the Consumer Price Index for all Urban Consumers in the Seattle-Tacoma-Bremerton Metropolitan Area ("CPI"), published by the U.S. Department of Labor, Bureau of Labor Statistics. Grantor shall notify Grantee in writing at least three (3) months prior to each Fee Adjustment Date of the new Exclusive Truck Loading Easement Fees that will be due starting on such Fee Adjustment Date. By way of example only, if the CPI as of July 1, 1999 is 100 and the CPI as of July 1, 2000 is 110 and the Exclusive Truck Loading Easement Fee due under this Easement Agreement immediately prior to the Fee Adjustment Date is $19,500, then the CPI-based fee adjustment would be 10% and the Exclusive Truck Loading Easement Fee would increase to $21,450 effective for the period from October 1, 2000 through September 30, 2001, and if, in that following year, the CPI as of July 1, 2001 is 115, then the next CPI-based fee adjustment would be 4.55% and the Exclusive Truck Loading Easement Fee would increase to $44,426 effective for the period from October 1, 2001 through September 30, 2002. In the event the CPI is discontinued, the parties shall agree upon another similar index to be used to calculate the contemplated adjustments, and in the event of an inability to agree, the parties shall request the American Arbitration Association or its successor to appoint a qualified arbitrator to establish an appropriate adjustment standard.

 c. There shall be an option exercisable one time for each five (5) year period during the term of the Agreement, with the first five (5) year period commencing October 1, 2004 and ending September 30, 2009, to have the fair market value of the Exclusive Truck Loading Easement Area reappraised and the Exclusive Truck Loading Easement Fee adjusted to equal eight percent (8%) of the reappraised fair market value of the Exclusive Truck Loading Easement Area (the "Reappraisal Option"). Either Grantor or Grantee may exercise the Reappraisal Option for any of the five (5) year periods specified above, subject to the following limitations: (a) the applicable Reappraisal Option for a five (5) year period may only be exercised during such five (5) year period and the one (1) year immediately prior to such five (5) year period, (b) once one party has exercised the applicable Reappraisal Option for a five (5) year period, neither party shall have any further right to exercise a Reappraisal Option during such five-year period, and (c) if one party sends the other party written notice inquiring as to whether the other party intends to exercise the Reappraisal Option for the then current five (5) year period, the party sending the inquiry notice is barred from exercising the applicable Reappraisal Option for such five (5) year period and the party receiving the inquiry notice is also barred from exercising the applicable Reappraisal Option for such five (5) year period unless the receiving party exercises the Reappraisal Option within thirty (30) days after receipt of the inquiry notice. Subject to the foregoing limitations, a party can exercise a Reappraisal Option by simply delivering written notice of its exercise of the Reappraisal Option to the other party. Upon delivery of the exercise notice, the parties shall proceed to determine the fair market value of the Exclusive Truck Loading Easement Area in the manner described below. Any adjustment in the Exclusive Truck Loading Easement Fee resulting from the exercise of the Reappraisal Option shall first take effect as of the first October 1 occurring after the date upon which the fair market value of the Exclusive Truck Loading Easement Area is finally determined in accordance with the procedures outlined below. The term "fair market value" of the Exclusive Truck Loading Easement Area shall mean the price that a commercially-reasonable purchaser, who is willing but not obligated to purchase the land comprising the Exclusive Truck Loading Easement Area, would be willing to pay for such land in an unimproved state to an owner willing but not obligated to sell it, as determined jointly by Grantor and Grantee, taking into consideration all uses for which the land was suited and might be applied, and assuming the land was owned by a private seller. If the parties cannot agree upon the fair market value of the land by the date that is thirty (30) days after a party has given notice of its exercise of the Reappraisal Option, then the parties shall agree within fifteen (15) days thereafter on one real estate appraiser (who shall be a member of the American Institute of Real Estate Appraisers, or equivalent) who will determine the fair market value of the land. If the parties cannot mutually agree upon an appraiser, then one M.A.I. qualified appraiser shall be appointed by Grantor and one M.A.I. qualified appraiser shall be appointed by Grantee within thirty (30) days of notice by one party to the other of such disagreement. The two appraisers shall determine the fair market value of the land; provided, however, if either party fails to appoint an appraiser within such thirty (30) day period, then the conclusion of the appraiser first appointed shall be final, conclusive and binding upon both parties. The appraiser(s) appointed shall proceed to determine fair market value within sixty (60) days following such appointment. The conclusion shall be final, conclusive and binding upon both parties. If said appraisers should fail to agree, but the difference in their conclusions as to fair market value is ten percent (5%) or less of the lower of the two appraisals, the fair market value shall be deemed the average of the two. If the two appraisers should fail to agree on the fair market value, and the difference between the two appraisals exceeds ten percent (5%), then the two appraisers thus appointed shall appoint a third M.A.I. qualified appraiser, and in case of their failure to agree on a third appraiser within thirty (30) days after their individual determination of the fair market value, either party may apply to the Presiding Judge of the King County Superior Court, requesting said Judge to appoint the third M.A.I. qualified appraiser. The third appraiser so appointed shall determine the fair market value of the land and the average of the fair market values stated in the two closest appraisals shall be deemed the fair market value for the purpose of this subparagraph 3.c. The costs and expenses of said third appraiser or the one appraiser the parties agree upon, shall be borne equally by the parties. The parties shall pay the fees and expenses of their respective appraisers if the parties fail to agree on a single appraiser. All M.A.I. appraisers appointed or selected pursuant to this Section shall have at least ten- (10) years experience appraising properties in the Seattle, Washington, area.

 4. Term of Easements. The term of this Easement Agreement and the Easements shall commence as of the date of this Agreement and shall remain in full force and effect up to and through the Termination Date, which is defined as the earlier of the following dates: (a) the date the Space Needle is no longer open for business on the Benefited Property (excluding temporary business interruptions); and (b) the date on which Grantor terminates the Easement Agreement due to Grantee's default in accordance with, and subject to the limitations, set forth in Paragraph 11 below. In addition, Grantee, if it determines it no longer requires the benefit of one or both of the Easements, shall have the right to terminate either one or both of the Easements, upon advance written notice to Grantor, which notice shall specify which of the Easements shall be terminated and the date on which such termination shall take effect (which date of termination shall be no sooner than ninety (90) days after the date of such notice). In the event only one of the Easements is being terminated by Grantee, all provisions of this Agreement insofar as it relates to the Easement being terminated shall no longer be deemed applicable as of the termination date for such Easement. Upon termination of this Easement Agreement, Grantee shall, at its sole cost and expense, remove the Truck Loading Improvements and restore the site to open space conditions consistent with adjacent areas and Seattle Center site standards.

 5. Indemnity. Grantee does hereby release and shall indemnify and hold Grantor harmless for, from and against all losses, liabilities, claims (including mechanics' or materialmen's liens), costs (including attorneys' fees), actions or damages of any sort or nature whatsoever incurred as a result of or arising out of Grantee's use of the Easement Areas to the extent attributable to the negligent acts or omissions, willful misconduct or breach of this Easement Agreement by Grantee, its servants, agents, employees and contractors. If a loss, liability, claim, cost, action or damage subject to this Paragraph 5 is caused by the joint or concurrent negligence of Grantee and Grantor, Grantee and Grantor shall each be responsible for such loss, liability, claim, cost action or damage in proportion to their respective negligence in the matter. The indemnities granted hereby shall not apply to any losses, liabilities, claims, costs, actions or damages caused by the sole negligence of Grantor. In the event that any action is brought against Grantor by any employee of Grantee, the indemnification obligation of Grantee set forth in this Paragraph shall not be limited by a limit on the amount or type of damages, compensation or benefits payable by or for Grantee under RCW Title 51, the Industrial Insurance Act, or any other employee benefit act. In addition, as to actions arising out of work performed pursuant to this Easement Agreement and solely for the purpose of giving full effect to the indemnities contained herein and not for the benefit of Grantee's employees or any third parties, Grantee waives its immunity under RCW Title 51. Grantee acknowledges that this indemnification has been negotiated by the parties.

 6. Insurance. Grantee shall, at its own cost and expense, obtain and maintain in effect during the term of this Easement Agreement and shall ensure that each of its contractors maintain throughout the course of any construction activities undertaken on the Easement Areas commercial general liability insurance, written on an insurance industry standard occurrence form (CG0001) or equivalent, including all the usual coverages known as Premises/Operations Liability, Products/Completed Operations, Personal/Advertising Injury, Contractual Liability, Independent Contractors' Liability, and Stop Gap, and providing property damage and bodily injury liability coverage with limits not less than $1,000,000 each occurrence and $2,000,000 in the aggregate, for any damage, loss or injury resulting from Grantee's use of the Easement Areas or the activities of its contractors thereon. If the construction activities involve significant excavation or digging, then the policies required of Grantee's contractors under this Section 6 shall include an explosion, collapse and underground endorsement. Grantee's insurance policies shall be primary to all other insurance of the Grantor, shall be rated A-:VII or higher in the A.M. Best's Key Rating Guide, shall be issued by a company licensed to do business in the State of Washington, and shall be subject to approval by Grantor's Risk Manager as to company, form and coverage. All insurance policies required under this Section 6 shall not be reduced or canceled without forty-five (45) days prior written notice to Grantor. Grantor shall be named as an additional insured on all such policies and shall receive as evidence of insurance a copy of each of the policy's declaration pages, showing the insuring company, effective dates, limits of liability, schedule of forms and endorsements, and the additional insured endorsement (ISO CG2026, or equivalent). Such declaration pages shall be due on the date of execution of this Easement Agreement with respect to the policy required of Grantee, and prior to commencement of any construction activities with respect to those policies required of Grantee's contractors. Grantor shall receive a renewal certificate or a certificate for a new policy meeting the foregoing requirements within thirty (30) days after the policy expiration date identified in the then last insurance certificate provided to Grantor.

 7. No Interference with Grantee's Use of Easement. Grantor shall not take any actions or permit acts by third parties, which would unreasonably interfere with the purpose of this Easement Agreement or would otherwise unreasonably impair or interfere with Grantee's use and enjoyment of the Easements.

 8. Liens; Taxes. Grantee covenants and agrees promptly to pay all sums legally due and payable by it on account of any work performed upon the Easement Areas and to keep Grantor's interest in the Burdened Property free and clear of all liens arising out of such work.

 9. As-Built Location. The parties acknowledge that in the course of construction despite Grantee's reasonable efforts or as a result of design changes approved by Grantor, the precise location of the Truck Loading Improvements, once constructed, may not perfectly coincide with the legal description of the Easement Areas established by Exhibit 4 and Exhibit 5. To the extent such discrepancies are non-material or were a result of design changes approved by Grantor, at the request of either party made after construction of the Truck Loading Improvements is completed, an amendment to this Easement Agreement shall be prepared, executed, acknowledged and recorded by the parties to amend the legal description of the applicable Easement Areas to reflect the actual as- built location of the applicable Truck Loading Improvements. To the extent the determination of the as-built location of the Truck Loading Improvements for the Exclusive Truck Loading Easement reveals that the actual area occupied by the Truck Loading Improvements for the Exclusive Truck Loading Area contains more or less square feet than the number specified in Section 3.a., the same amendment to this Easement Agreement, which amends the legal description of the Easement Areas, shall also amend the number specified in Section 3.a. and proportionately adjust the Exclusive Truck Loading Easement Fee. Grantee shall provide a survey or other documentation establishing the actual as-built location of the Truck Loading Improvements upon completion.

 10. Covenant With the Land. The Easements granted herein and the rights and restrictions contained herein shall be a covenant running with the land and shall be binding upon the Burdened Property and inure to the benefit of the Benefited Property.

 11. Grantor's Remedies Upon Grantee Default. Grantor shall only be entitled to terminate this Easement Agreement as a result of any default or breach by Grantee of any representation, warranty or covenant hereunder if (a) Grantor has given written notice of such default to Grantee and (b) Grantee has failed to cure such default within sixty (60) days of receipt of such written notice of default (or if the cure is not reasonably susceptible to cure within such sixty (60) day period, Grantee has commenced the cure within such sixty (60) day period and thereafter diligently pursues the cure to completion). Subject to the foregoing limitation, Grantor shall be entitled to pursue any and all other any right or remedy available at law or in equity for such default or breach by Grantee, including without limitation an action for specific performance, injunctive relief or actual damages.

 12. Notices. All notices required to be given hereunder shall be given in writing and shall be deemed delivered on the date of hand delivery of the notice or the date that is three days after mailing of the notice by certified or registered mail, return receipt, postage prepaid, to the parties at the addresses set forth below:

 EASEMENT AGREEMENT

 FOR INGRESS, EGRESS AND ANCILLARY IMPROVEMENTS

 (John and Broad Street Turn-Around, Pedestrian and Overhead Weather Protection Areas, and Signage)

 THIS EASEMENT AGREEMENT is executed as of this _____ day of ___________, 1999, by and between THE CITY OF SEATTLE, a municipal corporation of the State of Washington ("Grantor"), which is the owner of that parcel of real estate located in King County, Washington, and legally described in the attached Exhibit 1 (the "Burdened Property") and SPACE NEEDLE CORPORATION, a Washington corporation ("Grantee"), which is the owner of that parcel of real estate located in King County, Washington, and legally described in the attached Exhibit 2 (the "Benefited Property").

 In consideration of the mutual promises of the parties hereto and other good and valuable consideration, the receipt of which is hereby acknowledged, the Grantor and Grantee agree on behalf of themselves and their successors and assigns as follows:

 A G R E E M E N T S:

 1. Grant of Turn-Around Access Easement. Grantor hereby makes, declares, conveys and grants and establishes, for the benefit of the Benefited Property, a non-exclusive easement (the "Turn-Around Easement") on, over, under, across and within that portion of the Burdened Property generally shown on the attached Exhibit 3 and more particularly described on the attached Exhibit 4 (the "Turn-Around Easement Area") for constructing, establishing, using and operating a new publicly-accessible drop off, curb cut and turn-around (the "Turn-Around") for the use and enjoyment of the public and for ingress and egress of visitors to and from the Space Needle together with the right to install, maintain, operate, repair and replace the landscaping and other improvements constituting or associated with the Turn-Around (the "Turn-Around Improvements"), all in accordance with plans and specifications approved by Grantor.

 2. Grant of Pedestrian Access Easement. Grantor hereby makes, declares, conveys and grants and establishes, for the benefit of the Benefited Property, a non-exclusive easement (the "Pedestrian Access Easement") on, over, under, across and within that portion of the Burdened Property generally shown on the attached Exhibit 3 and more particularly described on the attached Exhibit 5 (the "Pedestrian Access Easement Area") for ingress and egress of visitors to and from the Space Needle and for constructing, establishing, using, operating, maintaining, repairing, removing and replacing the pedestrian thoroughfare and overhead weather protection improvements now or hereafter located on the Pedestrian Access Easement Area (the "Pedestrian Access Improvements"), all in accordance with plans and specifications approved by Grantor.

 3. Grant of Signage Easement. Grantor hereby makes, declares, conveys and grants and establishes, for the benefit of the Benefited Property, a non-exclusive easement (the "Signage Easement") on, over, under, across and within that portion of the Burdened Property generally shown on the attached Exhibit 3 and more particularly described on the attached Exhibit 6 (the "Signage Easement Area") for constructing, establishing, using, operating, maintaining, repairing, removing and replacing an illuminated monument sign identifying the Space Needle (the "Signage Improvements"), together with an underground electrical conduit from the Signage Improvements to an electrical panel serving either the Turnaround Improvements or the Space Needle (collectively, the "Signage Improvements"). The Signage Improvements and any successor sign shall be subject to the review and approval of Grantor, which shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed or conditioned. Grantee shall be responsible for obtaining all necessary governmental permits and approvals for the Signage Improvements. Upon termination of the Signage Easement or this Easement Agreement, Grantee shall, at its sole cost and expense, remove the Signage Improvements and restore the site to open space conditions consistent with adjacent areas and Seattle Center site standards. The Pedestrian Access Easement the Turn-Around Easement and the Signage Easement are sometimes hereinafter referred to collectively as the "Easements." The Pedestrian Access Easement Area, the Turn-Around Easement Area and the Signage Easement Area are sometimes hereinafter referred to collectively as the "Easement Areas." The Pedestrian Access Improvements, the Turn-Around Improvements, and the Signage Improvements are sometimes hereinafter referred to collectively as the "Improvements."

 4. Maintenance and Construction Requirements for Turn-Around Improvements. As part consideration for the grant of the Easements, Grantee covenants that the Improvements shall be installed and maintained at Grantee's sole cost and expense in a manner consistent with the landscaping and maintenance standards generally applicable to all tenants of the Seattle Center, and in accordance with plans and specifications approved by Grantor. Without limiting the foregoing covenant, Grantee specifically agrees to maintain, at its sole expense, all elements of the turn around, including all vehicular and pedestrian elements, all bollard light fixtures, fountain elements, canopies and other built surfaces. Grantee further covenants that any repair or replacement of the Improvements shall be performed in accordance with plans and specifications approved by the Grantor, in a good and workmanlike manner and in compliance with all applicable laws, regulations and rules (including the Seattle Center Construction Guidelines generally applicable to all tenants). All open spaces, pathways and landscape areas outside the Turn-Around Easement Area and not on the Benefited Property shall be maintained by Grantor. If Grantor in the exercise of reasonable judgment determines that it must have the Turn-Around Improvements maintained in whole or in part by Grantor's employees either because of a decree of a judicial or administrative tribunal or as a result of a negotiated settlement and/or agreement with Grantor's employees and/or their bargaining representative, then, thirty (30) days after Grantee's receipt of written notice of such determination from Grantor, Grantee shall be relieved of any further maintenance obligations for the applicable Turn-Around Improvements (except for contributing towards maintenance costs and expenses as further described below and for providing Grantor with specifications for the level and schedule of maintenance which Grantee has been performing) and Grantor shall assume and become solely responsible for such Turn-Around Improvement maintenance obligations under this Agreement. In such event Grantor shall perform all maintenance in accordance with all standards and specifications established pursuant to this Agreement, and shall carry out the same level and schedule of maintenance as previously carried out by Grantee, unless the parties agree otherwise. In the event Grantor assumes any maintenance obligations pursuant to this paragraph, Grantee shall, on an annual basis, contribute toward the documented cost and expense of such maintenance performed by Grantor in an amount equal to the lesser of: (a) the costs and expenses incurred for the applicable year by Grantor in performing the maintenance obligations, or (b) the costs and expenses incurred by Grantee in performing the maintenance obligations in the last full calendar year prior to Grantor's assumption of the maintenance obligations, provided that amounts paid pursuant to clause (b), above, shall be adjusted annually, to reflect increases in the total percentage change in the Consumer Price Index for all Urban Consumers in the Seattle-Tacoma-Bremerton Metropolitan Area ("CPI"), published by the U.S. Department of Labor, Bureau of Labor Statistics. To the extent the parties agree in writing that it is necessary or appropriate for maintenance and repair work to be carried out that is in addition to the level and schedule of maintenance established in the maintenance specifications, Grantor (or Grantee, if the parties so agree) shall carry out such additional maintenance or repair work and the cost of such additional maintenance or repair work shall be shared by the parties in accordance with the written agreement reached by the parties with respect to performance of such additional maintenance and repair work. Upon completion and without the necessity for any further action by Grantee, all of the Improvements located on Grantor's property shall become the property of the Grantor.

 5. Grantor's Right To Close Turn-Around. The parties acknowledge that part consideration for Grantor's grant of the Pedestrian Access Easement to Grantee is Grantee's agreement that Grantor shall have the right to close the Turn-Around for up to eight (8) days per calendar year in connection with major festivals or other events at the Seattle Center, provided the following conditions are met:

 (a) Grantor shall have provided at least sixty (60) days advance written notice to Grantee of any closure of the Turn-Around pursuant to this Paragraph 5;

 (b) Grantor shall work in good faith with Grantee to minimize business disruption to the Space Needle operations caused by such closures;

 (c) Other suitable pedestrian access to the Space Needle with temporary signage is provided by Grantor during the period of closure; and

 (d) Grantor shall not interfere with Grantee's use of the bus lay- by area now existing or hereafter constructed by Grantee alongside Broad Street to conduct its valet parking operations; however, the parties recognize and agree that such operations shall not interfere with the use of the lay-by area by members of the general public for passenger loading and unloading. Grantee shall be solely responsible for obtaining any and all permits necessary for the use of the bus lay-by for the above-described purpose. Grantor shall have no liability to Grantee for any costs, lost revenues or other damages incurred by Grantee as a result of any closures of the Turn-Around occurring pursuant to and in accordance with this Paragraph 5.

 6. Relocation of Easements. At the request of Grantor and subject to the prior written consent of Grantee, which shall not be unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned and subject to the additional conditions set forth in this Paragraph 6, the Easement Areas may be relocated or their sizes and/or dimensions modified. Any relocation of the Easement Areas or any change in the size or dimensions of the Easement Areas shall only occur if it is consistent with the-then use of the Benefited Property. Grantor shall bear any and all costs associated with any relocation of the Easement Areas or any change in the size or dimensions of the Easement Areas, including without limitation the cost of removing the original improvements in the original Easement Areas and constructing comparable new improvements consistent with the then-current use of the Space Needle in the relocated or changed Easement Areas. Grantor and Grantee, at Grantor's expense and at the request of either party, shall prepare, execute, acknowledge and record such documents and instruments as are necessary to amend this Easement Agreement to reflect any relocation or changes to the Easement Areas pursuant to this Paragraph 6.

 7. Term of Easements. The term of this Easement Agreement and the Easements shall commence as of the date of this Easement Agreement and shall remain in full force and effect in perpetuity, with the exception of the Signage Easement, which shall terminate at such time as the Space Needle ceases to be a civic center attraction generally open and available to the public, subject to such fees, rules and regulations that the Space Needle may impose in connection with admission to and use of its facilities. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Grantee, if it determines it no longer requires the benefit of one or more of the Easements, shall have the right to terminate one or more of the Easements, upon advance written notice to Grantor, which notice shall specify which of the Easements shall be terminated and the date on which such termination shall take effect (which date of termination shall be no sooner than ninety (90) days after the date of such notice. With respect to any of the Easements being terminated by Grantee, all provisions of this Easement Agreement insofar as it relates to the Easement being terminated shall no longer be deemed applicable as of the termination date of the Easement. Upon all Easements being terminated, this Easement Agreement shall be deemed terminated and thereafter shall have no further force or effect.

 8. Indemnity. Grantee does hereby release and shall indemnify and hold Grantor harmless for, from and against all losses, liabilities, claims (including mechanics' or materialmen's liens), costs (including attorneys' fees), actions or damages of any sort or nature whatsoever incurred as a result of or arising out of Grantee's use of the Easement Areas to the extent attributable to the negligent acts or omissions, willful misconduct or breach of this Easement Agreement by Grantee, its servants, agents, employees and contractors. If a loss, liability, claim, cost, action or damage subject to this Paragraph 8 is caused by the joint or concurrent negligence of Grantee and Grantor, Grantee and Grantor shall each be responsible for such loss, liability, claim, cost action or damage in proportion to their respective negligence in the matter. The indemnities granted hereby shall not apply to any losses, liabilities, claims, costs, actions or damages caused by the sole negligence of Grantor. In the event that any action is brought against Grantor by any employee of Grantee, the indemnification obligation of Grantee set forth in this Paragraph shall not be limited by a limit on the amount or type of damages, compensation or benefits payable by or for Grantee under RCW Title 51, the Industrial Insurance Act, or any other employee benefit act. In addition, as to actions arising out of work performed pursuant to this Easement Agreement and solely for the purpose of giving full effect to the indemnities contained herein and not for the benefit of Grantee's employees or any third parties, Grantee waives its immunity under RCW Title 51. Grantee acknowledges that this indemnification has been negotiated by the parties.

 9. Insurance. Grantee shall, at its own cost and expense, obtain and maintain in effect during the term of this Easement Agreement and shall ensure that each of its contractors maintain throughout the course of any construction activities undertaken on the Easement Areas commercial general liability insurance, written on an insurance industry standard occurrence form (CG0001) or equivalent, including all the usual coverages known as Premises/Operations Liability, Products/Completed Operations, Personal/Advertising Injury, Contractual Liability, Independent Contractors' Liability, and Stop Gap, and providing property damage and bodily injury liability coverage with limits not less than $1,000,000 each occurrence and $2,000,000 in the aggregate, for any damage, loss or injury resulting from Grantee's use of the Easement Areas or the activities of its contractors thereon. Grantee's insurance policies shall be primary to all other insurance of the Grantor, shall be rated A-:VII or higher in the A.M. Best's Key Rating Guide, shall be issued by a company licensed to do business in the State of Washington, and shall be subject to approval by Grantor's Risk Manager as to company, form and coverage. All insurance policies required under this Section 6 shall not be reduced or canceled without forty-five (45) days prior written notice to Grantor. Grantor shall be named as an additional insured on all such policies and shall receive as evidence of insurance a copy of each of the policy's declaration pages, showing the insuring company, effective dates, limits of liability, schedule of forms and endorsements, and the additional insured endorsement (ISO CG2026, or equivalent). Such declaration pages shall be due on the date of execution of this Easement Agreement with respect to the policy required of Grantee, and prior to commencement of any construction activities with respect to those policies required of Grantee's contractors. Grantor shall receive a renewal certificate or a certificate for a new policy meeting the foregoing requirements within thirty (30) days after the policy expiration date identified in the then last insurance certificate provided to Grantor.

 10. No Interference with Grantee's Use of Easement. Grantor shall not take any actions or permit acts by third parties, which would unreasonably interfere with the purpose of this Easement Agreement or would otherwise unreasonably impair or interfere with Grantee's use and enjoyment of the Easements. Grantor's exercise of its right to close the Turn-Around for up to eight (8) days per calendar year, in accordance with paragraph 5 of this Easement Agreement shall not be construed to be an interference with Grantee's use and enjoyment of the Easement.

 11. Liens; Taxes. Grantee covenants and agrees promptly to pay all sums legally due and payable by it on account of any work performed upon the Easement Areas and to keep Grantor's interest in the Burdened Property free and clear of all liens arising out of such work.

 12. As-Built Location. The parties acknowledge that in the course of construction despite Grantee's reasonable efforts or as a result of design changes requested by Grantor and approved by Grantor, the precise location of the Improvements, once constructed, may not perfectly coincide with the legal description of the Easement Areas established by Exhibit 4, Exhibit 5, and Exhibit 6. To the extent such discrepancies are non-material or were a result of design changes approved by Grantor, at the request of either party made after construction of the Improvements is completed, an amendment to this Easement Agreement shall be prepared, executed, acknowledged and recorded by the parties to amend the legal description of the applicable Easement Areas to reflect the actual as-built location of the applicable Improvements. Grantee shall provide a survey or other documentation establishing the actual as-built location of the Improvements upon completion.

 13. Covenant With the Land. The Easements granted herein and the rights and restrictions contained herein shall be a covenant running with the land and shall be binding upon the Burdened Property and inure to the benefit of the Benefited Property.

 14. Grantor's Remedies Upon Grantee Default. Grantor shall only be entitled to terminate this Easement Agreement as a result of any default or breach by Grantee of any representation, warranty or covenant hereunder if (a) Grantor has given written notice of such default to Grantee and (b) Grantee has failed to cure such default within sixty (60) days of receipt of such written notice of default (or if the cure is not reasonably susceptible to cure within such sixty (60) day period, Grantee has commenced the cure within such sixty (60) day period and thereafter diligently pursues the cure to completion). Subject to the foregoing limitation, Grantor shall be entitled to pursue any and all other any right or remedy available at law or in equity for such default or breach by Grantee, including without limitation an action for specific performance, injunctive relief or actual damages.

 15. Notices. All notices required to be given hereunder shall be given in writing and shall be deemed delivered on the date of hand delivery of the notice or the date that is three days after mailing of the notice by certified or registered mail, return receipt, postage prepaid, to the parties at the addresses set forth below:
