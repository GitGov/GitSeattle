 AN ORDINANCE relating to land use and zoning, amending Section 23.34.010, Designation of single-family zones, to permit rezone of single-family zoned land meeting single-family zone locational criteria, outside of urban village boundaries, to zones more intense than SF 5000, when certain conditions exist, and implementing a portion of the Delridge Neighborhood Plan.

 Whereas, the City Council finds that the rezoning established by this ordinance will protect and promote the health, safety and welfare of the general public, and implement the Delridge Neighborhood Plan; and

 Whereas, the City Council has approved and amendment to Comprehensive Plan Policy L74, permitting rezones of single-family zoned land meeting single-family zone locational criteria, outside of urban village boundaries, to zones more intense than SF 5000, when certain conditions exist; and

 Whereas, Whereas, the Delridge Neighborhood Plan recommends rezoning areas currently zoned single-family residential to Lowrise Duplex Triplex, and Seattle Municipal Code section 23.34.010 currently prohibits such rezones; and

 Whereas, the rezones are in close proximity to an underdeveloped neighborhood anchor where the majority of the commercially zoned properties in the vicinity are undeveloped for commercial use or are vacant; and

 Whereas, the rezones potentially increase the residential density of the area that is within easy walking distance of the neighborhood anchor in a location where physical barriers exist that limit pedestrian access; and

 Whereas, the neighborhood plan covers an area that has been included in a City sponsored neighborhood planning program because of the presence of economically distressed areas and support for the rezones has been demonstrated through the neighborhood planning process; and

 Whereas, the Council finds that the land use and zoning recommendations contained in the Delridge Neighborhood Plan are in the public interest and should be approved, and that amendment of the Comprehensive Plan and SMC 23.34.010 are therefore warranted;

 NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT ORDAINED BY THE CITY OF SEATTLE AS FOLLOWS:
