Within fourteen days of receiving the additional information, the building official shall notify the applicant in writing whether the application is now complete or what additional information is necessary. An application shall be deemed to be complete if the building official does not notify the applicant in writing by the deadlines in this section that the application is incomplete. The Director shall approve, condition or deny the application within 120 days as that time period is calculated pursuant to RCW 36.70B.090. If the building official finds that the work as described in an application for permit and the plans, specifications and other data filed therewith substantially conforms to the requirements of this code and other pertinent laws and ordinances and that the fees specified in the Fee Subtitle have been paid, he/she shall issue a permit therefor to the applicant who becomes the permit holder or authorized agent.

 EXCEPTIONS: 1. The building official may issue a permit for the construction of part of a building or structure before complete plans for the whole building or structure have been submitted or approved, provided that the proposed project complies with the State Environmental Policy Act as adopted by the City (Chapter 25.05 Seattle Municipal Code) and as amended and the Land Use Code, as amended; and provided further that adequate information and plans have been filed and checked to assure compliance with all pertinent requirements of this and other pertinent codes. The holder of such a permit shall proceed at his/her own risk without the assurance that the permit for the entire building or structure will be granted.

 2. After approval of a Master Use Permit as required by the Land Use Code, a permit for excavation may be issued.

 The building official may condition a permit where he/she determines that risks associated with development, construction, ownership and occupation in areas of the city, including, but not limited to potential slide areas, can be reduced to an acceptable level. The building official may deny such permit where he/she determines that the risks cannot be reduced to an acceptable level.

 106.6.2 Compliance with Approved Plans and Permit. When the building official issues a permit, he/she shall endorse the permit in writing and endorse in writing or stamp the plans APPROVED. Such approved plans and permit shall not be changed, modified or altered without authorization from the building official, and all work shall be done in accordance with the approved plans and permit except as the building official may require during field inspection to correct errors or omissions.

 106.6.3 Amendments to the Permit. When substitutions or changes are made during construction, approval shall be secured prior to execution, however, the building inspector may approve minor modifications to the plans for work not reducing the structural strength or fire and life safety of the structure.

Substitutions or changes made during construction subject to special inspection required by Section 1701 shall be approved by the building official. Substitutions, changes and clarifications shall be shown on two sets of plans which shall be submitted to and approved by the building official, accompanied by fees specified in the Fee Subtitle prior to occupancy. These substitutions and changes shall conform to the requirements of this code and other pertinent laws and ordinances.

 106.6.4. Cancellation of Permit Application. An application shall be deemed abandoned and void if a permit is not issued after a period of sixty days from the date of written notice of approval for issuance or if complete corrections are not received after a period of sixty days from the date of written notification of required corrections for compliance with this code. The building official may extend the period for issuance or submission of corrections if the building official determines that there are satisfactory reasons for the delay, or if a different schedule is agreed upon in writing before the end of the sixty day period. The building official may require the applicant to submit a written request for the extension with rationale before the end of the sixty day period. If the permit application is canceled, the site may be inspected to verify that no work has taken place. The application and any accompanying plans and specifications may be destroyed. If the application is being reviewed concurrently with a Master Use Permit application, and it is for a project vested to prior Land Use Code or Zoning Ordinance provisions, and the project does not conform with the codes in effect while it is being reviewed for Master Use Permit approval, cancellation of the building permit application under the provisions of this section shall cause the concurrent cancellation of the Master Use Permit application.

 106.7 Retention of Plans. One set of approved plans, which may be on microfilm, shall be retained by the building official. One set of approved plans shall be returned to the applicant and shall be kept at the site of the building or work at all times during which the work authorized is in progress for use by the inspection personnel.

 106.8 Validity of Permit. The issuance or granting of a permit or approval of plans shall not be construed to be a permit for, or an approval of, any violation of any of the provisions of this code or other pertinent laws and ordinances. No permit presuming to give authority to violate or cancel the provisions of this code shall be valid, except insofar as the work or use which it authorizes is lawful.

 The issuance of a permit based upon plans shall not prevent the building official from thereafter requiring the correction of errors in said plans or from preventing building operations being carried on thereunder when in violation of this code or of other pertinent laws and ordinances of the City.

 The issuance of a building permit shall not prevent the building official from requiring correction of conditions found to be in violation of this code or other pertinent laws and ordinances of the City, nor shall the period of time for which any such permit is issued be construed to extend or otherwise affect any period of time for compliance specified in any notice or order issued by the building official or other administrative authority requiring the correction of any such conditions.

 Section 79. Section 509.1 of the 1997 Uniform Building Code is amended as follows:

 509.1 Where Required. Unenclosed floor and roof openings, open and glazed sides of stairways, aisles, landings and ramps, balconies or porches, which are more than 30 inches (762 mm) above the adjacent  grade or floor below, and roofs used for other than service of the building shall be protected by a guardrail. Guardrails shall be provided at the ends of aisles where they terminate at a fascia of boxes, balconies and galleries.

 EXCEPTION: Guardrails need not be provided at the following locations:

 1. On the loading side of loading docks.

 2. On the auditorium side of a stage, raised platforms and other raised floor areas such as runways, ramps and side stages used for entertainment or presentation. Along the side of an elevated walking surface when used for the normal functioning of special lighting or for access and use of other special equipment. At vertical openings in the performance area of stages.

 3. Along vehicle service pits not accessible to the public.

 Section 80. Section 509.3 of the 1997 Uniform Building Code is amended as follows:

 509.3 Openings. Open guardrails shall have intermediate rails or an ornamental pattern such that a sphere 4 inches (102 mm) in diameter cannot pass through.

 EXCEPTIONS: 1. The open space between the intermediate rails or ornamental pattern of guardrails in areas of commercial and industrial-type occupancies which are not accessible to the public may be such that a sphere 12 inches (305 mm) in diameter cannot pass through.

 2. The triangular openings formed by the riser, tread and bottom element of a guardrail at the open side of a stairway may be of such size that a sphere 6 inches (152 mm) in diameter cannot pass through.

Code Alternate CA509: Intermediate rails need not be provided at the glazed sides of stairs, ramps and landings provided the glazing complies with Section 2406.6.

 For guardrail requirements at grandstands, bleachers or other elevated seating facilities, see Section 1008.5.7.

 Section 81. The 1997 Uniform Building Code is amended by adding Section 510 to read as follows:

 Section 510 - METHANE REDUCTION MEASURES

 510.1 Applicability. This section applies to all construction activities on or within 1,000 feet (305 m) of an active, closed or abandoned landfill that has been identified by the building official to be generating levels of methane gas on-site at the lower explosive limits or greater levels. The distance shall be calculated from the location of the proposed structure to the nearest property line of the active or former landfill site. The building official may waive these requirements if technical studies demonstrate that dangerous amounts of methane are not present on the site.

 510.2 Protection of Structures. All enclosed structures to be built within the 1,000 foot (305 m) landfill zone must be protected from potential methane migration. The method for insuring a structure's protection from methane shall be addressed in a report prepared by a licensed civil engineer and submitted by the applicant to the department for approval. The report shall contain a description of the investigation and recommendations for preventing the accumulation of explosive concentrations of methane gas within or under enclosed portions of the building or structure. At the time of final inspection, the civil engineer shall furnish a signed statement attesting that, to the best of the engineer's knowledge, the building or structure has been constructed in accordance with the recommendations for addressing methane gas migration.

 Section 82. The 1997 Uniform Building Code is amended by adding Section 511 to read as follows:

 Section 511 - RESTRICTIONS IN THE FIRE DISTRICT

 511.1 General. The provisions of this chapter apply only to the Fire District. All areas of the city lying outside the boundaries described here shall be considered to be outside of the Fire District for the purpose of applying this code.

 511.2 Fire District - Boundaries. The Fire District shall consist of that part of the city within the boundary described as follows:

 Beginning at the intersection of the center line of Alaskan Way and Clay Street; thence northeasterly along the center line of Clay Street to an intersection with the center line of Denny Way; thence easterly along the center line of Denny Way to an intersection with the center line of Yale Avenue; thence southeasterly along the center line of Yale Avenue to an intersection with the center line of Interstate Highway 5; thence southerly and south-easterly along the centerline of Interstate 5 to an intersection with the center line of 7th Avenue South; thence southerly along the center line of 7th Avenue South to an intersection with the center line of Dearborn Street; thence westerly along the center line of Dearborn Street to an intersection with the center line of Airport Way; thence northwesterly along the center line of Airport Way to an intersection with the center line of 4th Avenue South; thence southerly along the center line of 4th Avenue South to an intersection with the center line of South Royal Brougham Way; thence westerly along said center line of South Royal Brougham Way to an intersection with the center line of South Alaskan Way; thence southerly along the center line of South Alaskan Way to an intersection with the center line of South Massachusetts Street, thence westerly along the center line of South Massachusetts Street to the Outer Harbor Line in Elliott Bay, thence northerly and northwesterly along said Outer Harbor Line to an intersection with the center line of West Harrison Street, thence easterly along the center line of West Harrison Street to an intersection with the center line of Alaskan Way, then southeasterly along the center line of Alaskan Way to the point of beginning.

 511.3 Buildings Located Partially in the Fire District. A building or structure which is located partially within and partially outside of the Fire District, is considered to be located in the Fire District.

 511.4 Occupancies Prohibited in the Fire District. No Group H, Divisions 1 or 5 Occupancy is permitted in the Fire District. No Group H, Division 2 Occupancy having a floor area in excess of 500 square feet (46 m2) is permitted in the Fire District. No Group H, Division 3 Occupancy having a floor area in excess of 1,500 square feet (139 m2) is permitted in the Fire District.

 Section 83. The 1997 Uniform Building Code is amended by adding Section 512 to read as follows:

 Section 512 - RECYCLABLE MATERIALS.

 512.1 Definition. Recyclable materials are those solid wastes that are separated for recycling or reuse, such as papers, metals and glass.

 512.2 Storage Space for Recyclable Materials. All occupancies shall be provided with space for the storage of recyclable materials and solid waste.

 EXCEPTION: Group R, Division 3 and Group U Occupancies.

 The storage area shall be designed to meet the needs of the occupancy, efficiency of pick-up, and shall be available to occupants and haulers.

 Section 84. Table 5-A of the 1997 Uniform Building Code is amended as follows:

 SECTION 1003 - GENERAL

 1003.1 Means of Egress. All portions of the means of egress shall comply with the applicable requirements of Section 1003.

 1003.2 System Design Requirements. The general design requirements specified in this section shall apply to all three elements of the means of egress system, in addition to those specific design requirements for the exit access, the exit and the exit discharge detailed elsewhere in this chapter.

 1003.2.1 Use.

 1003.2.1.1 General. The building official shall assign a use category as set forth in Table 10-A to all portions of a building. When an intended use is not listed in Table 10-A, the building official shall establish a use based on a listed use that most nearly resembles the intended use.

 1003.2.1.2 Change in use. No change in use or occupancy shall be made to any existing building or structure unless the means of egress system is made to comply with the requirements of this chapter for the new use or occupancy. See Section 3405.

 1003.2.2 Occupant load.

 1003.2.2.1 General. The basis for the design of the means of egress system is the occupant load served by the various components of such system.

 1003.2.2.2 Determination of occupant load. Occupant loads shall be determined in accordance with the requirements of this section.

 1003.2.2.2.1 Areas to be included. In determining the occupant load, all portions of a building shall be presumed to be occupied at the same time.

 EXCEPTION: Accessory use areas that ordinarily are used only by persons who occupy the main areas of an occupancy shall be provided with means of egress as though they are completely occupied, but their occupant load need not be included when computing the total occupant load of the building.

Interpretation I1003.2a: Accessory use areas may include foyers, corridors, halls, toilet facilities, file rooms, storage rooms, closets, stairways, elevator enclosures and other service facilities.  Interpretation I1003.2b: In places of worship containing social halls, occupant load for the purpose of determining occupancy group may be computed as the sum of the areas reasonably expected to be occupied at one time, including principal worship area and classrooms or instructional areas, and principal worship area and social hall, and social hall and classrooms or instructional areas. Exits shall be computed on total capacity.

1003.2.2.2.2 Areas without fixed seats. For areas without fixed seats, the occupant load shall not be less than the number determined by dividing the floor area under consideration by the occupant load factor assigned to the use for such area as set forth in Table 10-A.

 The occupant load for buildings or areas containing two or more uses or occupancies shall be determined by adding the occupant loads of the various use areas as computed in accordance with the applicable requirements of Section 1003.2.2.2.

 Where an individual area has more than one proposed use, the occupant load for such area shall be determined based on that use that yields the largest occupant load.

 1003.2.2.2.3 Areas with fixed seats. For areas having fixed seats, the occupant load for such areas shall be determined by the number of fixed seats installed therein.

 For areas having fixed benches or pews, the occupant load shall not be less than the number of seats based on one person for each 18 inches (457 mm) of length of pew or bench. Where fixed booths are used in dining areas, the occupant load shall be based on one person for each 24 inches (610 mm) of booth length. Where fixed benches, pews or booths are curved, the larger radius shall determine the booth length.

 1003.2.2.2.4 Outdoor areas. The occupant load of yards, patios, courts and similar outdoor areas shall be assigned by the building official in accordance with their anticipated use. Such outdoor areas accessible to and usable by the building occupants shall be provided with a means of egress as required by this chapter. Where an outdoor area exits only through a building, the occupant load of such outdoor area shall be considered in the design of the means of egress system of that building.

 1003.2.2.2.5 Reviewing stands, grandstands and bleachers. The occupant load for reviewing stands, grandstands and bleachers shall be calculated in accordance with Section 1003.2.2.2 and the specific requirements contained in Section 1008.

 1003.2.2.3 Maximum occupant load.

 1003.2.2.3.1 Assembly occupancies. The maximum occupant load for an assembly occupancy shall not exceed the occupant load determined in accordance with Section 1003.2.2.2.

 EXCEPTION: When approved by the building official, the occupant load for an assembly occupancy may be increased, provided the maximum occupant load served does not exceed the capacity of the means of egress system for such increased number of occupants.

 For temporary increases of occupant loads in places of assembly, see the Fire Code.

 1003.2.2.3.2 Other occupancies. For other than assembly occupancies, an occupant load greater than that determined in accordance with Section 1003.2.2.2 is permitted; however, the means of egress system shall comply with the requirements of this chapter for such increased occupant load.

 1003.2.2.4 Minimum occupant load. An occupant load less than that determined in accordance with Section 1003.2.2.2 shall not be used.

 1003.2.2.5 Revised occupant load. No increase in occupant load shall be made to any existing building or structure unless the means of egress system is made to comply with the requirements of this chapter for such increased occupant load. See Section 3405.

 1003.2.3 Width.

 1003.2.3.1 General. The width of the means of egress system or any portion thereof shall be based on the occupant load served.

 1003.2.3.2 Minimum width. The width, in inches (mm), of any component in the means of egress system shall not be less than the product determined by multiplying the total occupant load served by such component by the applicable factor set forth in Table 10-B. In no case shall the width of an individual means of egress component be less than the minimum required for such component as specified elsewhere in this chapter.

 Where more than one exit or exit-access doorway serves a building or portion thereof, such calculated width ~~may~~shall be divided approximately equally among the means of egress components serving as exits or exit-access doorways for that area.

 1003.2.3.3 Maintaining width. If the minimum required width of the means of egress system increases along the path of exit travel based on cumulative occupant loads served, such width shall not be reduced or otherwise diminished to less than the largest minimum width required to that point along the path of exit travel.

 EXCEPTION: In other than Group H, Divisions 1, 2, 3 and 7 Occupancies, the width of ~~exterior exit~~ doors from an exit enclosure may be based on the largest occupant load of ~~all~~any level~~s~~ served by such exit enclosure multiplied by a factor of 0.2 (5.08).

 1003.2.3.4 Exiting from adjacent levels. No cumulative or contributing occupant loads from adjacent building levels need be considered when determining the required width of means of egress components from a given level.

 Where an exit enclosure from an upper floor and a lower floor converge at an intermediate floor, the width of the exit from the intermediate floor shall be based on the sum of the occupant loads of such upper and lower floors.

 1003.2.3.5 Two-way exits. Where exit or exit-access doorways serve paths of exit travel from opposite directions, the width of such exit or exit-access doorways shall be based on the largest occupant load served. Where such exit or exit-access doorways are required to swing in the direction of exit travel by Section 1003.3.1.5, separate exit width for each path of exit travel shall be provided based on the occupant load of the area that is served.

 1003.2.4 Height. Except as ~~specified~~allowed elsewhere in this ~~chapter~~code, the means of egress system shall have a clear height of not less than 7 feet (2134 mm) measured vertically from the walking surface to the lowest projection from the ceiling or overhead structure.

~~EXCEPTION: Sloped ceilings permitted by Section 310.6.1.~~

 1003.2.5 Exit continuity. The path of exit travel along a means of egress shall not be interrupted by any building element other than a means of egress component as specified in this chapter. Obstructions shall not be placed in the required width of a means of egress except projections permitted by this chapter. The required capacity of a means of egress system shall not be diminished along the path of exit travel.

 1003.2.6 Changes in elevation. All exterior elevation changes and  any interior elevation changes of 12 inches (305 mm) or more along the path of exit travel shall be made by steps, stairs or stairways conforming with the requirements of Section 1003.3.3.3 or ramps conforming with the requirements of Section 1003.3.4.

Sieve characteristics shall conform to those acceptable under ASTM Standard No. C-33.

 EXCEPTION: Aggregate shall not be required if a substitute material or system, with sufficient load bearing characteristics, and having approved capability to provide equal or superior air flow, is installed.

 3. Soil-gas Retarder Membrane. A soil-gas retarder membrane, consisting of at least one layer of virgin polyethylene with a thickness of at least 6 mil, or equivalent flexible sheet material, shall be placed directly under the concrete slab so that the slab is in direct contact with the membrane. The flexible sheet shall extend to the foundation wall or to the outside edge of the monolithic slab. Seams shall overlap at least 12 inches.

 EXCEPTION: If the membrane is not in direct contact with the bottom of the concrete slab, all overlapping seams shall be sealed with an approved tape or sealant, and the material shall be sealed to the foundation wall in a permanent manner. The membrane shall also be fitted tightly to all pipes, wire, and other penetrations of the membrane and sealed with an approved sealant or tape. All punctures or tears shall be repaired with the same or approved material and similarly lapped and sealed. In no case shall the membrane be installed below the aggregate.

 4. Sealing of Penetrations and Joints. All penetrations and joints in concrete slabs or other floor systems and walls below grade shall be sealed by an approved sealant to create an air barrier to limit the movement of soil gas into the indoor air.

 Sealants shall be approved by the manufacturer for the intended purpose. Sealant joints shall conform to manufacturer's specifications. There shall be no gaps or voids after the sealant has cured.

 Concrete block walls connected to below grade areas shall be considered unsealed surfaces. All openings in concrete block walls that will not remain accessible upon completion of the building shall be sealed at both vertical and horizontal surfaces, in order to create a continuous air barrier to limit the transport of soil gas into the indoor air.

 5. Radon Vent. One continuous sealed pipe shall run from a point within the aggregate under each concrete slab to a point outside the building. Joints and connections shall be permanently gas tight.

 The continuous sealed pipe shall interface with the aggregate in the following manner, or by other approved equal method: The pipe shall be permanently connected to a "T" lie within the aggregate area. A minimum of five feet of perforated drain pipe of three inches minimum diameter shall join to and extend from the "T". The perforated pipe shall remain in the aggregate area and shall not be capped at the ends. The "T" and its perforated pipe extensions shall be located at least five feet horizontally from the exterior perimeter of the aggregate area.

 The continuous sealed pipe shall terminate no less than 12 inches above the eave, and more than 10 horizontal feet from a woodstove or fireplace chimney, or operable window. The continuous sealed pipe shall be labeled "Radon Vent". The label shall be placed so as to remain visible to an occupant.

 The minimum pipe diameter shall be 3 inches unless otherwise approved. Acceptable sealed plastic pipe shall be smooth walled, and may include either PVC schedule 40 or ABS schedule of equivalent wall thickness.

 The entire sealed pipe system shall be sloped to drain to the sub-slab aggregate.

 The sealed pipe system may pass through an unconditioned attic before exiting the building; but to the extent practicable, the sealed pipe shall be located inside the thermal envelope of the building in order to enhance passive stack venting.

 EXCEPTION: A radon vent shall not be required if a fan-forced sub- slab depressurization system is installed. A fan-forced sub-slab depressurization system includes:

 1. Soil-gas retarder membrane as specified in Paragraph (c)3;

 2. Sealing of penetrations and joints as specified in Paragraph (c)4 above;

 3. A 3-inch continuous sealed radon pipe which shall run from a point within the aggregate under each concrete slab to a point outside the building;

 4. Joints and connections may be gas tight, and may be of either PVC schedule 40 or ABS schedule of equivalent wall thickness;

 5. A label of "Radon Vent" shall be placed on the pipe so as to remain visible to the occupant; and

 6. Fan circuit and wiring as specified in Paragraph (c) 6 below and a fan.

 If the sub-slab depressurization system is exhausted through the concrete foundation wall or rim joist, the exhaust terminus shall be a minimum of six feet from operable widows and outdoor air intake vents and shall be directed away from operable windows and outdoor air intake vents to prevent radon re-entrainment.

 6. Fan Circuit and Wiring and Location. An area for location of an in-line fan shall be provided. The location shall be as close as practicable to the radon vent pipe's point of exit from the building, or shall be outside the building shell. It shall be located so that the fan and all downstream piping is isolated from the indoor air.

 Provisions shall be made to allow future activation of an in-line fan on the radon vent pipe without the need to place new wiring. A 110 volt power supply shall be provided at a junction box near the fan location.

 7. Separate Aggregate Areas. If the 4 inch aggregate area underneath the concrete slab is not continuous, but is separated into distinct isolated aggregate areas by a footing or other barrier, a minimum of one radon vent pipe shall be installed into each separate aggregate area.

 EXCEPTION: Separate aggregate areas may be considered a single area if a minimum 3 inch diameter connection joining the separate areas is provided for every 30 feet of barrier separating those areas.

 Section 147. Section 1602 of the 1997 Uniform Building Code is amended as follows:

 SECTION 1602 - DEFINITIONS

 The following terms are defined for use in this code:

 ALLOWABLE STRESS DESIGN is a method of proportioning structural elements such that computed stresses produced in the elements by the allowable stress load combinations do not exceed specified allowable stress (also called working stress design).

 BALCONY, EXTERIOR, is an exterior floor system projecting from a structure and supported by that structure, with no additional independent supports.

 DEAD LOADS consist of the weight of all materials and fixed equipment incorporated into the building or other structure.

 DECK is an exterior floor system supported on at least two opposing sides by an adjoining structure and/or posts, piers, or other independent supports.

 FACTORED LOAD is the product of a load specified in Sections 1601 through 1611 and a load factor. See Section 1612.2 for combinations of factored loads.

LATERAL EARTH PRESSURE is the lateral pressure the retained earth exerts against foundation walls, basement walls, retaining walls and other earth retention structures.

 LIMIT STATE is a condition in which a structure or component is judged either to be no longer useful for its intended function (serviceability limit state) or to be unsafe (strength limit state).

 LIVE LOADS are those loads produced by the use and occupancy of the building or other structure and do not include dead load, construction load, lateral earth pressure or environmental loads such as wind load, snow load, rain load, earthquake load or flood load. See Section 1607.3.5 for posting of live loads.

 LOAD AND RESISTANCE FACTOR DESIGN (LRFD) is a method of proportioning structural elements using load and resistance factors such that no applicable limit state is reached when the structure is subjected to all appropriate load combinations. The term "LRFD" is used in the design of steel and wood structures.

 STRENGTH DESIGN is a method of proportioning structural elements such that the computed forces produced in the elements by the factored load combinations do not exceed the factored element strength. The term "strength design" is used in the design of concrete and masonry structures.

 Section 148. Section 1607.3 of the 1997 Uniform Building Code is amended as follows:

 1607.3 Floor Live Loads.

 1607.3.1 General. Floors shall be designed for the unit live loads as set forth in Table 16-A. These loads shall be taken as the minimum live loads in pounds per square foot of horizontal projection to be used in the design of buildings for the occupancies listed, and loads at least equal shall be assumed for uses not listed in this section but that create or accommodate similar loadings.

 Where it can be determined in designing floors that the actual live load will be greater than the value shown in Table 16-A, the actual live load shall be used in the design of such buildings or portions thereof. Special provisions shall be made for machine and apparatus loads.

 1607.3.2 Distribution of uniform floor loads. Where uniform floor loads are involved, consideration may be limited to full dead load on all spans in combination with full live load on adjacent spans and alternate spans.

 1607.3.3 Concentrated loads. Provision shall be made in designing floors for a concentrated load, L, as set forth in Table 16-A placed upon any space 21/2 feet (762 mm) square, wherever this load upon an otherwise unloaded floor would produce stresses greater than those caused by the uniform load required therefor.

 Provision shall be made in areas where vehicles are used or stored for concentrated loads, L, consisting of two or more loads spaced 5 feet (1524 mm) nominally on center without uniform live loads. Each load shall be 40 percent of the gross weight of the maximum-size vehicle to be accommodated. Parking garages for the storage of private or pleasure-type motor vehicles with no repair or refueling shall have a floor system designed for a concentrated load of not less than 2,000 pounds (8.9 kN) acting on an area of 20 square inches (12 903 mm2) without uniform live loads. The condition of concentrated or uniform live load, combined in accordance with Section 1612.2 or as appropriate, producing the greatest stresses shall govern.

 1607.3.4 Special loads. Provision shall be made for the special vertical and lateral loads as set forth in Table 16-B.

 1607.3.5 Live loads posted. ~~The live loads for which e~~E ach floor or portion thereof of a commercial or industrial building ~~is or has been designed~~with a design live load of more than 125 psf, and for warehouse and storage areas for any established live load, shall have such design live loads conspicuously posted by the owner in that part of each story in which they apply, using durable metal signs, and it shall be unlawful to remove or deface such notices. The occupant of the building shall be responsible for keeping the actual load below the allowable limits.

 Section 149. Section 1607.4 of the 1997 Uniform Building Code is amended as follows:

 1607.4 Roof Live Loads.

 1607.4.1 General. Roofs shall be designed for ~~the unit live loads, Ly set forth in Table 16-C~~a minimum 25 pounds per square foot snow load. The ~~live~~snow loads shall be assumed to act vertically upon the area projected on a horizontal plane. For greenhouses and lathhouses, see Interpretation I1607.4.

 1607.4.2 Distribution of loads. Where uniform roof loads are involved in the design of structural members arranged to create continuity, consideration may be limited to full dead loads on all spans in combination with full roof live loads on adjacent spans and on alternate spans.

 EXCEPTION: Alternate span loading need not be considered where the uniform roof live load is 20 psf (0.96 kN/m2) or more or where load combinations, including snow load, result in larger members or connections.

 For those conditions where light-gage metal preformed structural sheets serve as the support and finish of roofs, roof structural members arranged to create continuity shall be considered adequate if designed for full dead loads on all spans in combination with the most critical one of the following superimposed loads:

 1. Snow load in accordance with Section 1614.

~~2. The uniform roof live load, Lr, set forth in Table 16-C on all spans.~~~~3~~2. A concentrated gravity load, Lr, of 2,000 pounds (8.9 kN) placed on any span supporting a tributary area greater than 200 square feet (18.58 m2) to create maximum stresses in the member, whenever this loading creates greater stresses than those caused by the uniform live load. The concentrated load shall be placed on the member over a length of 21/2 feet (762 mm) along the span. The concentrated load need not be applied to more than one span simultaneously.

~~4~~3. Water accumulation as prescribed in Section 1611.7

 1607.4.3 Unbalanced loading. Unbalanced loads shall be used where such loading will result in larger members or connections. Trusses and arches shall be designed to resist the stresses caused by unit ~~live~~snow loads on one half of the span in combination with wind loads as specified in Section 1612 if such loading results in reverse stresses, or stresses greater in any portion than the stresses produced by the required unit ~~live~~snow load on the entire span. ~~For roofs whose structures are composed of a stressed shell, framed or solid, wherein stresses caused by any point loading are distributed throughout the area of the shell, the requirements for unbalanced unit live load design may be reduced 50 percent.~~

The following additional load combinations shall be considered:  1. One half of the snow load on one half of the span shall be substituted for S/2 in Formula (12-14).

 2. One half of the snow load on one half of the span plus full snow load on the other half shall be substituted for snow in Formula (12- 15).

 1607.4.4 Special roof loads. Roofs to be used for special purposes shall be designed for appropriate loads as approved by the building official.

 Greenhouse roof bars, purlins and rafters shall be designed to carry a 100-pound-minimum (444.8 N) concentrated load, Lr, in addition to the ~~uniform live~~snow load.

Interpretation I1607.4: Greenhouses and lathhouses not used as a place of human habitation may be designed for a 10 pound per square foot snow load.

 Section 150. Section 1607.6 of the 1997 Uniform Building Code is hereby repealed.

 Section 151. Section 1614 of the 1997 Uniform Building Code is amended as follows:

 SECTION 1614 - SNOW LOADS

 Buildings and other structures and all portions thereof that are subject to snow loading shall be designed to resist the snow loads, as determined by the building official, in accordance with the load combinations set forth in Section 1612.2 or 1612.3.

 Potential unbalanced accumulation of snow at valleys, parapets, roof structures and offsets in roofs of uneven configuration shall be considered.

 Snow loads in excess of 20 psf (0.96 kN/m2) may be reduced for each degree of pitch over 20 degrees by Rs as determined by the formula:

 Rs = S/40 - through

 For SI: Rs = S/40 - 0.024

 WHERE:

 Rs = snow load reduction in pounds per square foot (kN/m2) per degree of pitch over 20 degrees.

 S = total snow load in pounds per square foot (kN/m2).

~~For alternate design procedure, where specifically adopted, see Appendix Chapter 16, Division I.~~

Code Alternate CA1614.a: The engineer may consider drifting and sliding snow loading using the ground snow load per the latest Structural Engineers Association of Washington "Snow Load Recommendations for Washington". However, the results shall be no less than the minimum requirement calculated according to Section 1614.

 Section 152. Section 1618 of the 1997 Uniform Building Code is amended as follows:

 SECTION 1618 - BASIC WIND SPEED

 The minimum basic wind speed at any site shall ~~not be less than that shown in Figure 16-1. For those areas designated in Figure 16-1 as special wind regions and other areas where local records or terrain indicate higher 50-year (mean recurrence interval) fastest-mile wind speeds, these higher values shall be the minimum basic wind speeds~~be 80 miles per hour.

 Section 153. Section 1619 of the 1997 Uniform Building Code is amended as follows:

 SECTION 1619 - EXPOSURE

 An exposure shall be assigned at each site for which a building or structure is to be designed.

Interpretation I1619: An exposure B may be assigned to any site within the City regardless of individual site characteristics.

 Section 154. Section 1629.1 of the 1997 Uniform Building Code is amended as follows:

 SECTION 1629 - CRITERIA SELECTION

 1629.1.1 Basis for Design. The procedures and the limitations for the design of structures shall be determined considering seismic zoning, site characteristics, occupancy, configuration, structural system and height in accordance with this section. Structures shall be designed with adequate strength to withstand the lateral displacements induced by the Design Basis Ground Motion, considering the inelastic response of the structure and the inherent redundancy, overstrength and ductility of the lateral-force-resisting system. The minimum design strength shall be based on the Design Seismic Forces determined in accordance with the static lateral force procedure of Section 1630, except as modified by Section 1631.5.4. Where strength design is used, the load combinations of Section 1612.2 shall apply. Where Allowable Stress Design is used, the load combinations of Section 1612.3 shall apply. Allowable Stress Design my be used to evaluate sliding or overturning at the soil-structure interface regardless of the design approach used in the design of the structure, provided load combinations of Section 1612.3 are utilized. One- and two-family dwellings in Seismic Zone 1 need not conform to the provisions of this section.

1629.1.2 Predesign Conference. At least 60 days prior to application, the applicant shall arrange a predesign conference with the structural engineer of record and the building official to review the proposed building structural system when it is undefined as described in Section 1629.6 or when an alternate procedure is used as allowed in Section 1629.10. It is the purpose of the meeting to obtain conceptual approval from the building official of the proposed structural system and to allow for design based upon the latest state of the art.  The building official may require sufficient documentation, based upon appropriate analyses, that the proposal meets the intent of nationally recognized good practices. The building permit shall not be issued until the building official has approved, in writing, the earthquake design concept for the building. The documentation of the predesign meeting shall be reflected on the plans for the building and become a permanent part of the Department of Construction and Land Use records.

 Section 155. Section 1635 of the 1997 Uniform Building Code is hereby repealed.

Reject rate is defined as the number of welds containing rejectable defects divided by the number of welds completed. For evaluating the reject rate of continuous welds over 3 feet (914 mm) in length where the effective throat thickness is 1 inch (25 mm) or less, each 12-inch increment (305 mm) or fraction thereof shall be considered as one weld. For evaluating the reject rate on continuous welds over 3 feet (914 mm) in length where the effective throat thickness is greater than 1 inch (25 mm), each 6 inches (152 mm) of length or fraction thereof shall be considered one weld.~~~~2~~1. For complete penetration groove welds on materials less than 5/16 inch (7.9 mm) thick, nondestructive testing is not required; for this welding, continuous inspection is required.

~~3~~2. When approved by the building official and outlined in the project plans and specifications, this nondestructive ultrasonic testing may be performed in the shop of an approved fabricator utilizing qualified test techniques in the employment of the fabricator.

 2. Partial penetration groove welds when used in column splices shall be tested either by ultrasonic testing or radiography when required by the plans and specifications. For partial penetration groove welds when used in column splices, with an effective throat less than 3/4 inch (19.1 mm) thick, nondestructive testing is not required; for this welding, continuous special inspection is required.

 3. Base metal thicker than 11/2 inches (38 mm), when subjected to through- thickness weld shrinkage strains, shall be ultrasonically inspected for discontinuities directly behind such welds after joint completion.

 Any material discontinuities shall be accepted or rejected on the basis of the defect rating in accordance with the (larger reflector) criteria of approved national standards.

 Section 206. The 1997 Uniform Building Code is amended by adding a new Chapter 34 to read as follows:

 Chapter 34

 EXISTING STRUCTURES

 Note: This chapter is entirely Seattle amendments to the Uniform Building Code and is not underlined.

 SECTION 3401--GENERAL

 Buildings in existence at the time of the passage of this building code which were legally constructed and occupied in accordance with the provisions of a prior code may have their existing occupancy continued, provided such occupancy is not hazardous.

 Any change in the occupancy or character of occupancy of any existing building, structure or portion thereof shall comply with the provisions of Section 109 and Section 3405.

 In order to legalize an existing occupancy for the record, it is required that the building comply with the fire and life safety requirements of this building code or the effective code at the time the building was constructed. If the existing occupancy or character of occupancy is other than that for which the building was constructed, the building shall comply with this building code or the effective code at the time the existing occupancy was legally established.

 SECTION 3402 -- MAINTENANCE

 3402.1 General. All buildings or structures, both existing and new, and all parts thereof shall be maintained in a safe and sanitary condition. All devices or safeguards which are or were required by a code in effect when the building or structure was erected, altered, or repaired shall be maintained in good working order. The owner or a designated agent shall be responsible for such maintenance of buildings and structures. It shall be unlawful to fail to so maintain these parts of the building or equipment or to fail to immediately comply with any lawful notice or order of the fire chief or the building official.

 EXCEPTIONS: 1. The building official may modify the requirements of this subsection where all or a portion of a building is unoccupied, closed off and reasonably secure from unlawful entry.

 2. Occupants of Group R, Division 1 apartments, and Group R, Division 3 dwellings shall be responsible for the maintenance of smoke detectors required by Section 310.9.

 3402.2 Unsafe Building Appendages. Parapet walls, cornices, spires, towers, tanks, statuary and other appendages or structural members which are supported by, attached to, or a part of a building and which are in a deteriorated condition or are otherwise unable to sustain the design loads which are specified in this building code, are hereby designated as unsafe building appendages. All such unsafe building appendages are public nuisances and shall be abated in accordance with Section 102 of this building code.

 3402.3 Central Waterfront Piers. All piers located between West Harrison Street and South Massachusetts Street, both existing and new, and all portions thereof shall be maintained in a safe condition capable of supporting the design loads as specified in this code. See also Section 413.

 SECTION 3403--ADDITIONS, ALTERATIONS OR REPAIRS

 3403.1 General. Buildings and structures to which additions, alterations or repairs are made shall comply with all the requirements of this code for new facilities except as specifically provided in this section. See Section 310.9 for provisions requiring installation of smoke detectors in existing Group R, Division 3 Occupancies. See also applicable provisions of the Seattle Energy Code.

 3403.2 When Allowed. Additions, alterations or repairs may be made to any building or structure without requiring the existing building or structure to comply with all the requirements of this code, provided the addition, alteration or repair conforms to that required for a new building or structure.

 EXCEPTIONS: 1. Alterations of existing structural elements, or additions of new structural elements, which are not required by Section 3403.11 and which are initiated for the purpose of increasing the lateral-force- resisting strength or stiffness of an existing structure need not be designed for forces conforming to these regulations provided that an engineering analysis is submitted to show that:

 1.1. The capacity of existing structural elements required to resist forces is not reduced, and

 1.2. The lateral loading to required existing structural elements is not increased beyond their capacity, and

 1.3. New structural elements are detailed and connected to the existing structural elements as required by this code, and

 1.4. New or relocated nonstructural elements are detailed and connected to existing or new structural elements as required by this code, and

 1.5. An unsafe condition as defined in Section 102 is not created.

 2. Where changes to offices, outpatient clinics or medical offices occur on a multi-tenant floor which contains non-conforming corridors, new tenant walls associated with the tenant change need not meet the standards for one-hour corridor construction, unless the project is considered a substantial alteration as defined in this chapter.

Any building plus new additions shall not exceed the height, number of stories and area specified for new buildings.

 EXCEPTION: An addition to an existing nonconforming building may exceed the limitations of the preceding paragraph if an area separation wall is provided, the existing building is not made more nonconforming, and the addition conforms to this code.

 3403.3 Impracticality. In cases where total compliance with all the requirements of this code is impractical, the applicant may arrange a pre- design conference with the design team and the building official. The applicant shall identify design solutions and modifications that conform to Section 104.14. The building official may waive specific requirements in this code which he/she has determined to be impractical.

 3403.4 Compliance with Retroactive Ordinances. Alterations and repairs to existing buildings which are being made in response to a notice or order requiring compliance with the Housing and Building Maintenance Code, Subtitle II, Title 22 of the Seattle Municipal Code, Fire Code or other ordinances applicable to existing buildings, shall be permitted to be made in accordance with the standards contained in those ordinances, rather than the standards for new buildings contained in this building code. Where standards are not specified in those ordinances, such alterations or repairs must conform to the requirements of this chapter of the building code.

 3403.5 Damaged Buildings. When repairs are made to a building that was damaged by fire or other means, and the repairs exceed 60 percent of the building's value, the entire building shall conform to the requirements of this code. The value of the building shall be determined by the building official, or by the assessed value per King County records or by an appraisal made by a recognized appraisal agency approved by the building official.

3403.6 Non-structural Alterations or Repairs. Alterations or repairs which are non-structural and do not affect any member or part of the building or structure having required fire-resistance may be made with the same materials of which the building or structure is constructed, provided that no change shall be permitted which increases its hazard.

 3403.7 Maintenance of Structural Stability. When approved by the building official, minor structural alterations or repairs necessary to maintain the structural stability of the building may be made with the same material of which the building or structure is constructed.

 3403.8 Historic Buildings and Structures. The building official may modify the specific requirements of this building code as it applies to buildings and structures designated as landmarks of historical or cultural importance and require in lieu thereof alternate requirements which, in the opinion of the building official, will result in a reasonable degree of safety to the public and the occupants of those buildings.

 A historic building or structure is one which has been designated for preservation by the City Landmarks Preservations Board or the State of Washington, has been listed, or has been determined eligible to be listed, in the National Register of Historic Places, has been officially nominated for such status, or is a structure contributing to the character of a landmark or special review district.

 3403.9 Radon-resistive Construction Requirements. The radon-resistive construction requirements found in Chapter 12 shall apply to all Group R buildings to which either an addition or substantial alteration is made where the basement, foundation or crawl space is altered or expanded.

 3403.10. Unreinforced Masonry Chimneys. Existing exterior unreinforced masonry chimneys shall not be extended except with approved metal chimneys in accordance with Section 814 of the Mechanical Code.

 Whenever an unreinforced masonry chimney is altered or when the building in which such a chimney is located undergoes substantial alteration, the chimney shall be tied at each floor or ceiling and the portion of the chimney above the roof shall be braced.

 3403.11 Substantial Alterations or Repairs.

 3403.11.1 General. Any building or structure to which additions, or substantial alterations or repairs are made shall conform with the requirements of this Section and Sections 403 (high rise buildings, when applicable), 511 (special requirements for the Fire District, when applicable), Sections 713.10 (smoke dampers), 713.11 (fire dampers), 801 through 805, 808 (interior finishes), 904 (fire-extinguishing systems), and Chapter 10 (means of egress). Fire alarms shall be provided as required by Chapter 3. See also Article 10 of the Fire Code.

 See Section 3403.10 for specific requirements for unreinforced masonry chimneys.

 3403.11.2 Definition. For the purpose of this section, substantial alterations or repairs may mean any one of the following and as determined by the building official:

 1. Extensive structural repair.

 2. Remodeling or additions which substantially extend the useful physical and/or economic life of the building or significant portion of the building, other than typical tenant remodeling.

 3. A change of a significant portion of a building to an occupancy that is more hazardous than the existing occupancy, based on the combined life and fire risk as determined by the building official. Table 34-A may be used by the building official as a guideline. A change of tenant does not necessarily constitute a change of occupancy.

 4. Reoccupancy of a building that has been substantially vacant for more than 24 months in occupancies other than Group R, Division 3.

 5. A significant increase in the occupant load of an unreinforced masonry building.

 3403.11.3 Seismic Regulations. The provisions of Division IV of Chapter 16, Earthquake Regulations, shall apply to all buildings or structures to which substantial alterations or repairs are made. In addition, the building official may require testing of existing materials when there is insufficient evidence of structural strength or integrity.

 Exceptions: 1. If an alteration is substantial only because it is a change to a more hazardous occupancy, compliance with this subsection is only required if the life hazard risk increases, as determined by the building official.

 2. The building official may accept a proposal in lieu of compliance with Chapter 16. The proposal shall be based on a comprehensive report prepared by a licensed structural engineer according to rules promulgated by the Director. The report shall include an investigation and structural analysis of the building based on an approved standard. The report shall specify the building's seismic deficiencies, and propose measures that will provide an acceptable degree of seismic safety considering the nature, size and scope of the project. This requirement shall also apply to Section 102 as conditions may require.

 3. In lieu of compliance with the seismic provisions of Chapter 16 for Group R, Division 3 Occupancies, when approved by the building official, the applicant may evaluate and strengthen portions of the building lateral support structure, such as foundations and cripple walls.

 3403.11.4 Other Structural Work. All other structural work shall comply with the requirements of Chapters 15 through 23 and Sections 1403 and 2604.

 SECTION 3404 -- MOVED BUILDINGS

 Buildings or structures moved into or within the city shall comply with standards adopted by the building official. No building shall be moved into or within the city unless, prior to moving, the building official has inspected the building for compliance with this building code and the permit holder has agreed to correct all deficiencies found and has been issued a building permit for the work. A bond or cash deposit in an amount sufficient to abate or demolish the building shall be posted prior to issuance of a permit. See Section 106 for information required on plans. Any moved building that is not in complete compliance with standards for moved buildings within eighteen months from the date of permit issuance and is found to be a public nuisance may be abated.

 SECTION 3405 -- CHANGE OF OCCUPANCY

 No change shall be made in the character of occupancies or use of any building which would place the building in a different division or subdivision of the same group of occupancy or in a different group of occupancies, unless such building is made to comply with the requirements of this chapter and the requirements of Chapter 3 for such division or group of occupancy. Change of tenants will be permitted so long as the character of the occupancy is not changed.

 EXCEPTION: The character of the occupancy of existing buildings may be changed subject to the approval of the building official, as set forth in Section 3403. The building may be occupied for purposes in other groups without conforming to all the requirements of this code for those groups, provided the new or proposed use is not more hazardous, based on life and fire risk, than the existing use.

 No change in the character of occupancy of a building shall be made without a certificate of occupancy, as required in Section 109 of this code. The building official may issue a certificate of occupancy pursuant to the intent of the above exception without certifying that the building complies with all provisions of this code.

 In addition to the requirements of Sections 310, 1203 and 2903, upon conversion of an existing building to residential occupancy, the elements of the dwelling unit envelope which are altered shall comply with the sound transmission control requirements of Section 1206.

 See Section 3403.11 for additional requirements for substantial alterations.

 Section 207. The 1997 Uniform Building Code is amended by adding a new Appendix Chapter 4 to read as follows:

 APPENDIX CHAPTER 4

 Division II -- UTILITY TRANSFORMER VAULTS

 This chapter is entirely Seattle amendments to the Uniform Building Code and is not underlined.

 436.1 General

 436.1.1 Scope. Vaults containing utility transformers or equipment will be required to comply with this appendix chapter and requirements of Seattle City Light.

 436.1.2 Definition. Utility transformer vaults are those which contain transformer equipment owned by Seattle City Light or other electric power utility.

 436.2 When Required. Transformer vaults shall be required for all utility transformers located inside a building. Seattle City Light shall approve the size, location, and layout of all utility vaults.

 436.3 Access

 436.3.1 General. At least one accessible opening, which may be a door or hatch, shall be provided to every vault. The opening shall be adequate in size to permit the installation and removal of the equipment located in the vault, and shall be kept unobstructed at all times. An unobstructed level area shall be provided at the entrance to all vaults. The level area shall be large enough to allow for removal of the transformer.

 436.3.2 Access. Vaults shall be accessible to Seattle City Light personnel at all times. If it is necessary to pass through locked doors to reach a vault, keys to those doors shall be kept in a key box which can be opened with the key to the transformer vault. Persons other than Seattle City Light personnel shall not have access to utility transformer vaults.

 436.4 Location. Vaults shall be located so that there is an equipment access path between the vault and the building exterior. The floor along the path shall be designed to support the weight of the transformer and other equipment. If a path is not provided, the building owner shall agree to remove the equipment to the right of way whenever the Superintendent of Seattle City Light determines it is necessary, and the owner shall pay all costs for removal and replacement. All doors between the vault and the building exterior shall be large enough for removal of transformers. See Section 414.7.3 for doorway requirements.

 436.5 Size. The size of vaults shall be as determined by the Superintendent of Seattle City Light.

 436.6 Construction. Floors, walls and ceilings of vaults shall have at least a three-hour fire-resistive rating and shall be constructed of solid concrete or concrete-filled concrete masonry units at least 6 inches (152 mm) thick. Vault floors shall be smooth with no pads and shall slope toward the vault sump. Seismic anchor inserts shall be embedded in the floor when required by the Superintendent of Seattle City Light.

 436.7 Openings into Transformer Vaults

 436.7.1 Protection of Openings. All doorways opening into a transformer vault from the building interior shall be protected by a fire assembly having a fire-protection rating equal to the fire-resistive rating required for the vault. Exterior openings, other than doors and ventilation openings, shall be protected by fire assemblies having a three-fourths-hour fire-protection rating when located below openings in another story or when located less than 10 feet (3048 mm) from other doors or windows of the same building.

 436.7.2 Locks. All doors shall be equipped with locks and shall be kept locked. Doors to vaults shall be equipped with locks provided by the utility. Personnel doors shall be equipped with panic bars, pressure plates, or other devices that are normally latched but open under simple pressure.

 436.7.3 Doorways. A removable curb 4 inches (102 mm) high, or as high as necessary to contain oil, shall be installed below each door. All doors shall be made of steel and shall swing out of the vault 180 degrees. Equipment access doorways to vaults containing single-phase transformers shall have clear openings at least 42 inches (1067 mm) wide and 6 feet 8 inches (2032 mm) high. Equipment access doorways for all other transformers shall be as specified by Seattle City Light. Doorways for personnel access shall have clear openings of at least 36 inches (914 mm) wide and 6 feet 8 inches (2032 mm) high.

 436.8 Ventilation Systems

 436.8.1 General. Ventilation systems shall be provided to dispose of heat from transformer total losses without creating a temperature rise which is in excess of the transformer rating.

 436.8.2 Method of Ventilation. Ventilation for transformer vaults shall be provided by either natural circulation or mechanical circulation.

 1. Natural circulation. All vaults containing up to three transformers of no more than 75 kVA each may be ventilated by natural circulation. The combined minimum net intake and exhaust area, exclusive of area occupied by screen, grating or louvers, shall not be less than 3 square inches (1935 mm2) per kVA of transformer capacity. The total required area shall be divided roughly equally between intake and exhaust. In no case shall either intake or exhaust be less than 72 square inches (46 452 mm2).

 Roughly one-half the total area of required ventilation openings shall be in one or more openings in the lower one-half of the vault walls and roughly one-half shall be in one or more openings in the upper one-half of the exterior sidewalls or roof of the vault. Intake openings shall be located on the opposite side of the vault from exhaust openings. Intake openings shall not be located in the ceiling of the vault.

 2. Mechanical circulation. Positive or negative pressure ventilation systems shall supply a minimum of 1.6 cfm (.76 L/s) of air per kVA of transformer capacity. The fans shall be installed outside of the vault and shall be controlled by a thermostat located inside the vault. The intake shall be located in the lower one-half of an exterior wall of the vault and the exhaust shall be in the roof or ceiling or in the upper one-half of the sidewalls of the vault. The ventilation system shall cause air to flow longitudinally across the transformers.

 Forced air ventilation systems shall be designed by the applicant. The capacity and location of the ventilation system shall be approved by the Superintendent of Seattle City Light.

 Power for the ventilation system shall be provided by the building owner.

 436.8.3 Ventilation Openings and Duct Terminations. Ventilation openings and duct terminations shall comply with the following:

 1. Location of exhaust ventilation openings and exhaust duct terminations. Unless otherwise approved by the building official, exhaust ventilation openings and duct terminations shall be located not less than 10 feet (3048 mm) from fire escapes, required exits, combustible materials and unprotected openings. Exhaust outlets shall be located on the exterior of the building.

 2. Covering. Ventilation openings shall be covered with durable metal gratings, screens or louvers.

 3. Opening protection. Intake ventilation openings in the vault walls on the interior of the building shall be protected by automatic closing fire dampers having a fire-resistance rating at least equal to that required for the vault. The actuating device on the fire damper should be made to function at a temperature of 165 degrees F.

 4. Ventilation ducts. Exhaust ventilation ducts, if used, shall be enclosed in construction having a fire-resistance rating at least equal to that required for the vault. Exhaust ducts shall extend from the vault to the outside of the building. An exhaust duct for a mechanically ventilated vault shall be used exclusively for ventilating the vault.

 436.8.4 Mechanical Circulation Temperature Control. A remote temperature controller shall be installed in the vault. The controller shall activate the fan when the temperature in the vault exceeds 70 degrees F., and shall turn the fan off when the temperature reaches 140 degrees F.

 A visible or audible alarm shall be installed outside each vault that will be activated if the fan does not operate when the temperature controller calls for ventilation, or if the fan becomes inoperable. A sign shall be mounted near the alarm stating CALL SEATTLE CITY LIGHT WHEN ALARM SOUNDS or CALL SEATTLE CITY LIGHT WHEN LIGHT IS ON.

 436.9 Drainage

 436.9.1 General. Drains shall be prohibited in all transformer vaults.

 436.9.2 Sumps. All transformer vaults shall have a dry sump. All sumps shall have an opening of at least 12 inches (304.8 mm) diameter with a removable metal grate that is flush with the floor. The sump shall be located near the personnel door, out of the entry path. The vault floor shall slope at least one inch in ten feet (25 mm in 305 mm) toward the sump.

 Sumps shall have a capacity of at least 8 cubic feet (.23 m3) or as specified by the utility. Sumps shall have minimum dimensions of 12 inches (305 mm) diameter and 12 inches (305 mm) depth. The sump shall have a grouted bottom. It shall be located within reach of the personnel door and shall not be located in the path for moving transformers in and out of the vault.

 436.10 Pipes and Ducts. No pipes or ducts foreign to the electrical installation shall enter or pass through any transformer vault. Piping or other facilities provided for fire protection inside the vault or for transformer cooling are deemed not to be foreign to the electrical installation.

 436.11 Storage In Transformer Vaults. No material may be stored in any transformer vault.
