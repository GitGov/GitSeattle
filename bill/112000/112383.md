 ORDINANCE ____________________

 AN ORDINANCE related to cable television; authorizing the Mayor to enter into amendments to the cable television franchise with TCI of Washington, Inc. (TCI).

 WHEREAS, Consistent with the terms of the franchise, TCI is rebuilding its cable television system to 750 MHz to bring increased channel capacity, Internet cable services, and other benefits to Seattle cable subscribers; and

 WHEREAS, TCI and the City had agreed under the franchise that TCI would make available, at the City's request and at incremental cost, certain fiber for the City's exclusive ownership and use; and

 WHEREAS, City of Seattle and TCI managers have met to review TCI's proposed engineering schedule to determine whether fiber could be made available under the foregoing franchise provision; and

 WHEREAS, the City has identified certain fiber requirements that necessitate increasing the maximum fiber run authorized under the franchise, and TCI agrees to that increase; and

 WHEREAS, TCI seeks to amend the provisions of Section 7.7 of the Franchise regarding standby power to incorporate the design successfully used in the former Viacom territory; and

 WHEREAS, the proposed redesign will make greater use of existing locations, reduce construction activity, and speed up project completion time; and

 WHEREAS, the City has reviewed the proposed redesign, and finds it acceptable; Now, Therefore,

 BE IT ORDAINED BY THE CITY OF SEATTLE AS FOLLOWS:

 Section 1. The Mayor is authorized to enter into amendments with TCI of the franchise governing the TCI and Viacom Cable Districts as set forth in Exhibit A to Ordinance 117956 consistent with the terms and conditions set forth below:

 a. Section 13.14(C) is deleted in its entirety.

 b. A new Section 13.14(C), is added as follows:

 "The Grantee agrees to provide to the City 48 fibers from 8900 Roosevelt to the 32nd Floor of the Westin Building, 2001 6th Avenue, Seattle (approximately 66,000 fiber feet), using existing fiber paths that Grantee has in place. Grantee agrees to provide these fibers at incremental cost, which Grantee currently estimates to be $1.061 per foot (assuming Alcatel armored loose tube EX prep fiber cable is used). Grantee estimates the unit cost of splicing to be between $30 to $40 per splice, and will charge such costs only to the extent that excess splicing is required by the additional 48 fibers. Other incremental costs that Grantee may charge include those resulting from splice cases, additional project supervision, ground cases or any other hardware/labor affected exclusively by the City's 48 fibers, but only to the extent that new or additional costs arise directly from the installation of the City's 48 fibers."

 Section 7.7 is amended to strike in its entirety the following sentence:

 "The Grantee's cable system will be backed up with an average of 4 hours standby power at each node and at such cable plant that is contiguous to such node."

 A new subsection a is added to Section 7.7 as follows:

 "The Grantee's system must have back-up power supplies capable of providing power to the system and related facilities continuously at all headends and hubs and for at least three hours at all optical transfer nodes and nodes in the event of an electrical outage. In addition, the design and construction of the system shall include modulators, antennae, amplifiers and other electronics that permit and are capable of passing through the signals received at the headend without substantial alteration or deterioration. (Thus, for example, the system shall include components so that a signal received at the headend in color may be received by the subscriber in color, and a stereo signal in stereo.)"

 Section 2. Any acts consistent with and prior to the effective date of this Ordinance are hereby ratified and confirmed.

 Section 3. This ordinance shall take effect and be in force thirty (30) days from and after its approval by the Mayor, but if not approved and returned by the Mayor within ten (10) days after presentation, it shall take effect as provided by Municipal Code Section 1.04.020.

 Passed by the City Council the _______ day of _________________________, 199____, and signed by me in open session in authentication of its passage this _______ day of _________________________, 199____.
