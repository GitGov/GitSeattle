 Section 1. Levy of Additional Regular Property Taxes - Submittal. The City hereby submits to the qualified electors of the City a proposition as authorized by RCW 84.55.050 to exceed the levy limitation on regular property taxes contained in RCW 84.55.010 for property taxes levied in 1999 through 2006 for collection in 2000 through 2007, respectively, for the sole purpose of raising Seventy- Two Million Dollars ($72,000,000) in aggregate over a period of up to eight (8) years, to provide for improvements to the Opera House at Seattle Center, replacement of the Seattle Center Flag Pavilion with a new Festivals Pavilion and open space, construction or remodeling of community centers, extension of operating hours at community centers, development of neighborhood civic centers, funding of neighborhood gathering places, and establishment of an "Opportunity Fund" for future projects. The proposition shall be limited so that the City shall not levy in any year more than Eighteen Million Dollars ($18,000,000) in addition to the maximum amount of regular property taxes it could have levied consistent with chapter 84.55 RCW in the absence of this ordinance. Pursuant to RCW 84.55.050(4), the maximum regular property taxes that may be levied in 2007 for collection in 2008 and in later years shall be computed as if the limit on regular property taxes had not been increased under this ordinance.

 Section 2. Use of Proceeds. Up to Thirty-Six Million Dollars ($36,000,000) of the proceeds of the additional taxes authorized under this ordinance shall be used for the combined purposes of redeveloping the Opera House at Seattle Center and replacing the Seattle Center Flag Pavilion with a new Festivals Pavilion and open space (together, the "Seattle Center component"). Up to Thirty-Six Million Dollars ($36,000,000) of the proceeds of the additional taxes authorized under this ordinance shall be used for the combined purposes of construction or remodeling of community centers, extension of operating hours at community centers, development of neighborhood civic centers, funding of neighborhood gathering places, and establishment of an "Opportunity Fund" for future projects (together, the "Community Centers component"). In the annual City budget or by separate ordinance, the City Council shall from year-to-year determine the budget and allocations between the two components; establish, add, or delete projects within a component; choose projects or programs to be funded through the Opportunity Fund; or change the scope of activities within a component. However, in no case shall funds authorized for the Seattle Center component be shifted to the Community Centers component, nor shall funds authorized for the Community Centers component be shifted to the Seattle Center component. Funds and appropriations unexpended at the end of any budget year shall automatically be carried over to the next budget year.

 Section 3. Application of Proceeds. The proceeds of the additional taxes authorized under this ordinance shall be deposited into the 1999 Seattle Center/Community Centers Fund, which is hereby created in the City Treasury. Money in that Fund may be temporarily deposited or invested in such manner as may be lawful for the investment of City money and interest and other earnings shall be deposited in the Fund. The principal proceeds and any interest or other earnings from their deposit or investment shall be applied solely for the purposes authorized in this ordinance. The portion of taxes allotted to the Seattle Center component shall be deposited into a Seattle Center Subfund within the Fund, and the portion of taxes allotted to the Community Centers component shall be deposited into a Community Centers Subfund within the Fund. The Finance Director is authorized to create other funds, subfunds, or accounts as may be needed to implement the purposes of this ordinance.

 Section 4. Bond and Notes. To the extent permitted by applicable law the City may issue bonds, notes, or other evidences of indebtedness payable wholly or in part from the proceeds of the additional taxes authorized under this Ordinance, and apply such tax proceeds to the payment of principal of, interest on, and premium (if any) on such bonds, notes, or other evidences of indebtedness and to the payment of costs associated with them.

 Section 5. Election - Ballot Title. The King County Director of Records and Elections, as ex officio supervisor of elections, is hereby directed to submit to the qualified electors of the City the proposition set forth below at the City general election on November 2, 1999.
