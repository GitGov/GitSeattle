 AN ORDINANCE enacting into law the provisions of Initiative Measure 45, providing that any provisions found to be outside the scope of the power of initiative shall be null and void.

 WHEREAS, for more than six years leading up to March 1998, and especially in the four months before that date, neighborhood groups, library users, and other interested individuals and groups throughout Seattle shared with The City Librarian, the Seattle Library Board of Trustees, the City Council, and the Mayor their ideas for a comprehensive plan to redevelop and revitalize the Seattle Public Library system. The construction and financing plan that emerged from those thousands of hours of community involvement, the Libraries for All plan, was the subject of numerous subsequent public meetings, including the first-ever joint meetings of the Seattle City Council, the Library Board of Trustees, and the Mayor.

 WHEREAS, in November 1998, sixty-nine percent (69%) of Seattle's voters overwhelmingly approved Proposition 1 to authorize the City to carry out the Libraries for All capital program.

 WHEREAS, also in November 1998, the Mayor and City Council endorsed funding for increasing library hours of operation during the 2000 budget year. Beginning in January 2000, the Library Board of Trustees expects that all full-sized libraries will operate 60 hours per week and all smaller libraries will operate a minimum of 48 hours per week.

 WHEREAS, since November 1998, the City, through its Library Board of Trustees, has moved forward on the timeline developed in the Libraries for All plan towards rebuilding or modernizing all 22 branch libraries in the Seattle Public Library System and constructing a new downtown library and three new neighborhood libraries. One hundred million dollars in voter-approved bonds have been sold, and the first new library facility, at Holly Park, is expected to open in October 1999. Work on the Wallingford-Wilmot branch is on track for it to open in December 1999. Siting decisions are expected to be made by the Library Trustees this year on the Beacon Hill, Capitol Hill (Henry), High Point, Delridge and Ballard branch libraries. Also in 1999, preliminary siting and architect selection work is expected to begin in other neighborhoods.

 WHEREAS, Initiative Measure 45 was originally filed at a time when it could have qualified for placement on the November 1998 ballot as an alternative to Proposition 1, but it did not gather sufficient signatures in a timely manner to qualify for that ballot.

 WHEREAS, now that Proposition 1 has been approved by the voters, Initiative Measure 45 proposes, in sections 1 through 6, authority for an additional, different, capital construction and financing plan for library facilities. It is not presently the intention of the Mayor and City Council to utilize this authority, but rather it is the intention to continue expeditiously to implement Libraries for All with the voted debt authorized in Proposition 1 and by the Council in Ordinance 119185, and the councilmanic debt authorized in Ordinance 119020.

 WHEREAS, several of the later sections of Initiative Measure 45 propose operating policies, such as extended operating hours, or budgeting matters that are in keeping with goals of the Library Trustees and City Council, respectively. The Library Trustees have already enacted a new policy of not naming any library building for an individual or corporation, a policy proposed in Section 11 of Initiative Measure 45.

 WHEREAS, substantial portions of Initiative Measure 45, both in sections 1 through 6 and in later sections, appear to be outside the scope of initiative authority permitted to municipal voters under the State Constitution and State law. Washington courts have interpreted the Constitution to mean that the power of initiative granted by local charters does not extend to certain areas, such as administrative (as opposed to legislative) matters and subjects that have been delegated by the state legislature to a specific body such as the city legislative authority (here the City Council) or the Library Board. Many of the provisions of Initiative Measure 45 are directed to administrative matters, and others attempt to usurp authority (such as to establish operating hours and library fees) the state legislature has vested exclusively in the Library Trustees, or (as in the case of appropriating funds for libraries) in the City Council.

 WHEREAS, Washington courts have also ruled that if a measure contains provisions that are not subject to initiative, the remaining provisions that are directed to and necessary for carrying out that same purpose are also not subject to initiative.

 WHEREAS, Washington courts have ruled that proposed initiatives that are outside the permitted scope of local initiative power are appropriately not placed on the ballot, regardless of local charter provisions.

 WHEREAS, therefore, with serious doubts about whether Initiative Measure 45 is a legally proper initiative, the City faces the choice to (1) place Initiative Measure 45 on the ballot this fall, or (2) enact it into law as requested by the petitioners, or (3) do neither and immediately defend a legal challenge about the constitutional limitations of the initiative power.

 WHEREAS, the Council and Mayor share common goals with the proponents of Initiative Measure 45, with the 69% of Seattle voters who endorsed Libraries for All, and with the Library Trustees. The City is committed to completing all the capital facilities planned in Libraries for All as quickly and as well as we can.

 WHEREAS, litigating the legal doubts about Initiative Measure 45 or placing it on the ballot could complicate the planning and construction of the library facilities in the Libraries for All plan. A ballot measure with provisions not subject to initiative could seriously hinder citizen participation in the community planning, site selection, and architect selection processes that are underway in neighborhoods throughout the City.

 WHEREAS, following this enactment of Initiative Measure 45, the City will attempt to incorporate it with the voter-approved Libraries for All capital construction and funding plan that is already being implemented.

 WHEREAS, it is not in the public interest to spend public resources fighting in the courts about the legality and application of Initiative Measure 45 unless and until that action becomes necessary. When and if legal questions are raised, it may be necessary to resolve in court whether all or any part of Initiative Measure 45 is subject to initiative. Should that time come, the same legal questions will be presented for resolution regardless of whether Initiative Measure 45 were approved by vote of the people or enacted by the Council and Mayor.

 NOW THEREFORE, BE IT ORDAINED BY THE CITY OF SEATTLE AS FOLLOWS:

 Section 1 The City of Seattle (the "City") shall acquire, design, construct, renovate, relocate, replace, improve, and equip library facilities comprising three majors components: (1) Branch libraries located at Ballard, Beacon Hill, Broadview, Columbia, Douglass-Truth, Fremont, Green Lake, Greenwood, Henry, High Point, Holly Park, Lake City, Madrona, Magnolia, Montlake, Northeast, Queen Anne, Rainier Beach, Southwest, University, Wallingford, and West Seattle, proposed branches to be located at Delridge, International District, and Northgate and other possible locations, and satellite branches with a combined expected allocation of Eighty-Seven Million Dollars ($87,000,000) of bond proceeds; (2) a downtown library branch, with an expected allocation of Forty-Seven Million Dollars ($47,000,000) of bond proceeds; (3) an initial book and material collection for expanded and new branch libraries, with an expected allocation of Four Million Dollars ($4,000,000) of bond proceeds; and (4) a system-wide computer and audio-visual technology upgrade for all facilities with links to schools for a combined expected allocation of Nineteen Million Dollars ($19,000,000) of bond proceeds (collectively, the "Project"). the estimated cost of the Project, including the costs of issuing and selling the bonds authorized by this ordinance, is declared to be, as nearly as may be, One Hundred Sixty Million Dollars ($160,000,000). The economic life of the facilities comprising the Project is expected to be at least thirty (30) years.

 Section 2 The City shall provide property tax relief, incur indebtedness and borrow not to exceed One Hundred Sixty Million Dollars ($160,000,00) on the credit of the City and issue and sell its tax limited general obligation bonds not to exceed that principal amount for strictly municipal capital purposes, other than the replacement of equipment, to provide all or part of the funds for the Project. Costs of engineering, architectural, planning, project management, financial, legal and other services lawfully incurred incident to the Project, costs of issuance of the bonds, and an apportionment equal to not more than one percent (1%) of construction expenditures on the Project upon public works for art pursuant to Seattle Municipal Code Section 20.32.030, shall be appropriate capital costs to be paid from the proceeds of the bonds authorized by this ordinance.

 Section 3 The City may not transfer bond proceeds from one Project component described in Section 1 to another. The expected allocation for each Project component may not increase.

 Section 4 The City's total public contribution to Project component 2 (downtown branch library) described in Section 1 is limited to (1) the maximum allocation of Forty-Seven Million Dollars ($47,000,000) of bond proceeds; plus (2) an amount less than or equal to the difference between Seventy-Three Million Dollars ($73,000,000) and the actual amount to be paid by the City for the Pacific Place Parking Garage as described in the Umbrella Agreement by and among the City of Seattle, Pine Street Development, and Community Development Properties. This additional City contribution is permitted in a separate tax limited obligation bond issue by ordinance. Contributions from other public or private entities or individuals are permitted for each Project component.

 Section 5 The bonds described in this ordinance shall be issued as a single issue, as a part of a combined issue with other authorized bonds, or in more than one series and shall be issued within ten (10) years of the effective date of this ordinance. The bonds shall be fully registered; shall bear interest payable as permitted by law; may mature serially or as term bonds with the longest maturities being within thirty (30) years from their date or within any shorter period fixed by the City Council; shall be paid from any money legally available sufficient in amount to pay both principal and interest when due; and shall be issued and sold in the manner, at the times and in the amounts as required for the Project. The exact date, form, terms, option of prior redemption, price, interest rate or rates and maturities of the bonds shall be fixed hereafter pursuant to ordinance. Pending the issuance of the bonds and receipt of their proceeds, the City Council may authorize issuance of short-term obligations pursuant to 39.50 RCW, and the costs of those short-term obligations shall be included in the cost of the Project for which the bonds are issued. If the City, prior to the date bonds or other short-term obligations are issued to finance the Project, shall make capital expenditures for the Project from funds that are not (and are not reasonably expected to be) reserved, allocated on a long-term basis or otherwise set aside by the City under its existing and reasonably foreseeable budgetary and financial circumstances to finance the Project, those capital expenditures are intended to be reimbursed out of proceeds of the bonds or other short-term obligations issued in an amount not to exceed the principal amount provided by this ordinance.

 Section 6 The City shall not begin construction of the downtown branch until construction of each neighborhood branch library has begun. Branch construction must be completed within five (5) years.

 Section 7 The City shall provide financing to maintain and repair all library facilities to acceptable standards. Deferral of maintenance at any library facility is prohibited.

 Section 8 Each library branch, including the downtown branch, shall be open to the public at least fifty-seven (57) hours a week or its present 1998 hour per week allotment, whichever is greater. No branch library can be permanently closed without relocation to a nearby facility of equal or better capacity and quality. The minimal operating-hour requirement in this Section goes into effect at each branch whether construction has commenced or not.

 Section 9 The City shall provide a minimum of an additional Five Million Dollars ($5,000,000) annually in excess of the 1998 budget to the library for its operating expenses.

 Section 10 The City shall not increase any library fees or levy additional property taxes to finance funding requirements described in Sections 7 through 9.

 Section 11 The City is prohibited in the future from allowing new or existing library facilities to be named for individuals or corporations. The intent of this section is to preserve the integrity of the Seattle Public Library system.

 Section 12 The City Council shall pass by Resolution an explanation to the State Legislature as to why it lobbied for an increase in its tax limited obligation bond capacity for a stated purpose of financing libraries, but had not done so.

 Section 13 The sections of this ordinance shall be severable so that a judgment of invalidity of any section shall not invalidate the entire ordinance.

 Section 14 This ordinance shall take effect at the time it shall become a law under the provisions of the Seattle City Charter.

 Section 15 Each provision or group of related provisions of law enacted in this ordinance shall be null and void if and when a court finally determines that the provision or group of provisions was not within the scope of the power of initiative of the voters of The City of Seattle.

 Section 16 This ordinance shall take effect and be in force thirty (30) days from and after its approval by the Mayor, but if not approved and returned by the Mayor within ten (10) days after presentation, it shall take effect as provided by Municipal Code Section 1.04.020.
