 AN ORDINANCE relating to landslide damage sustained by City facilities during the 1995-96, 1996-1997, and 1997-98 winters; making supplemental and partially reimbursable appropriations from the Emergency Subfund; and increasing the 1998 expenditure allowances of Seattle Transportation and the Department of Parks and Recreation; all by a three-fourths vote of the City Council.

 WHEREAS, Ordinance 118609 and Ordinance 118316 provided funds for projects to repair damage caused to City facilities by severe weather conditions and storms during the 1995-96 and 1996-1997 winters, to protect public safety; and

 WHEREAS, as work has progressed on these repair projects, it has become apparent that some projects will cost less than initially estimated, while others will cost more, and that the total cost of the projects will be greater than initially estimated; and

 WHEREAS, the weather conditions and storms of the 1997-98 winter resulted in a landslide along Southwest Admiral Way, causing damage to City facilities that the City has determined are in need of repair to protect public safety, and

 WHEREAS, the damage to City facilities along Southwest Admiral Way has reduced public access on Southwest Admiral Way, which is an important City arterial street;

 WHEREAS, some of the expenses relating to these various landslide repair projects and other storm costs are eligible for reimbursement from the Federal Emergency Management Agency, the Federal Highway Administration, and the State of Washington; Now, Therefore;
