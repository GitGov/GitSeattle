 AN ORDINANCE relating to land use and zoning, extending the moratorium on the acceptance of applications for use permits or construction permits for seaplane operations or facilities in the "Downtown Harborfront 1" and "Downtown Harborfront 2" zones, and adopting an amended workplan.

 BE IT ORDAINED BY THE CITY OF SEATTLE AS FOLLOWS:

 Section 1. The City Council hereby declares and adopts the following findings of fact:

 a. On January 6, 1999 the City Council passed and the Mayor signed Ordinance 119328 establishing a moratorium through November 1, 1999, or the effective date of new land use regulations governing the location of "water-based airports," whichever is sooner, on the acceptance of any applications for a use or construction permit for any "airport, water-based," as defined in SMC 23.84.038, proposed to be located within the "Downtown Harborfront 1" or Downtown Harborfront 2" zones.

 b. Within sixty (60) days after adoption of Ordinance 119328 the City Council held a public hearing on the ordinance pursuant to the requirements of RCW 36.70A.390.

 c. Because a MUP application for a water-based airport was pending at the time of the adoption of Ordinance 119328 and because the information that could be gleaned from evaluating the actual impacts of a seaplane operation was considered to be useful in evaluating whether such uses are appropriate on the central waterfront, Ordinance 119328 did not prohibit processing and issuance of a temporary permit for any Master Use Permit application submitted prior to January 1, 1999. In order to evaluate the actual impacts of a seaplane operation on the central waterfront and to avoid possible permanent adverse impacts that could result from operations of a water-based airport on the downtown waterfront, Ordinance 119328 placed a time limit on the authority to operate a water-based airport for any Master Use permit application that was pending on January 1, 1999. Ordinance 119328 provided that, for any Master Use permit application for an "airport, water-based," that was pending on January 1, 1999 and that was later approved, the authority to operate a water-based airport pursuant to the permit was limited to a maximum of 1 year and five months. Under Ordinance 119328 the exact period of time that seaplane operations will be allowed pursuant to any permit that is granted for an application that was pending on January 1, 1999, is based on the effective date of the permit (i.e., the date of any final appellate decision authorizing the granting of the permit). Pursuant to Ordinance 119328 any final appellate decision granting the permit that is issued prior to June 1 of a particular year results in a permit with authority to operate through October 31st of that same year. Any final appellate decision issued on or after June 1 of a particular year results in a permit with authority to operate through October 31st of the next year.

 d. By Ordinance 119328 the City Council also approved a "Work Program for Central Waterfront Seaplane Analysis" that, among other items, provided that the Department of Design, Construction and Land Use (DCLU) is to analyze the impacts of "temporarily allowing seaplane operations on Elliott Bay" and is to gather and analyze data on other cities' experiences with seaplane operations.

 e. Since adoption of Ordinance 119328, the Master Use Permit application for a water-based airport that was pending at the time of the adoption of Ordinance 119328 was approved by a decision of the Department of Design, Construction and Land Use dated May 27, 1999. That decision has been appealed by three different parties to the Shoreline Hearings Board. The Shorelines Hearings Board has now scheduled a hearing in April of 2000. Pursuant to the State Shoreline Management Act, a permit for a use on the shoreline is not considered issued or "in effect" until all appeal proceedings have been completed. It is not possible for all appeal proceedings in this case to be completed before November 1, 1999, the date the moratorium imposed by Ordinance 119328 is due to expire. Therefore, there can be no "temporary actual operations" of seaplanes on Elliott Bay prior to the expiration of the current moratorium.

 f. If the moratorium is not extended for twelve months, the City Council will not have an opportunity to evaluate the actual impacts of a temporary seaplane operation during tourist season in making its decision whether the central waterfront is an appropriate location for seaplane operations.

 g. There is insufficient time between now and the expiration of the current moratorium on November 1, 1999 for all of the following to be completed: 1) the Department of Design, Construction and Land Use to complete all of the work program that was adopted by Ordinance 119328 and the additional work included in the amended work program; 2) the City Council to prepare, have hearings on and adopt any amendments they may deem appropriate to regulate seaplanes on the central waterfront; and 3) the Department of Ecology to review and approve any such amendments in order for them to take effect.

 h. The City Council believes that it will take at least twelve (12) additional months for all of the work referenced in subsection (g) to be completed.

 i. If proposals to establish permanent seaplane operations or facilities are allowed to become legally vested before the work of the City and the Department of Ecology have been completed, all of the work and the ultimate legislative decision may be rendered meaningless, and uses may become permanently established that are inimical to the public health, safety and welfare.

 j. In order for the City Council to continue to fulfill its fundamental responsibility to address constituent concerns and to protect and promote the public health, safety and welfare, it is necessary to continue to temporarily prohibit the general acquisition of vested rights to establish seaplane operations or facilities along Seattle's central waterfront.

 k. The City has legal authority to establish a temporary permit moratorium pursuant to the authority granted by Article 11, Section 11 of the Washington Constitution, the Growth Management Act, RCW 36.70A.390, and Matson v. Clark County, 79 Wn. App. 641 (1995).

 l. The City has completed SEPA review of the proposed extension of the moratorium pursuant to SMC chapter 25.05.

 Section 2. Through November 1, 2000 or until new regulations governing the location of "water-based airports" adopted by the City Council take effect, whichever is sooner, no use permit application or construction permit application may be accepted for any "airport, water-based", as defined in SMC 23.84.038, proposed to be located within the "Downtown Harborfront 1" or "Downtown Harborfront 2" zones.

 Section 3. The amended workplan attached as Attachment 1 to this ordinance is hereby approved and adopted.

 Section 4. This ordinance shall take effect and be in force thirty (30) days from and after its approval by the Mayor, but if not approved and returned by the Mayor within ten (10) days after presentation, it shall take effect as provided by Municipal Code Section 1.04.020.
