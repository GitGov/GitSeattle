 AN ORDINANCE relating to community and economic development; authorizing modification of security for a Section 108 loan and Urban Development Action Grant loan in order to facilitate refinancing of the Promenade 23 Shopping Center; and authorizing related agreements, amendments, and actions.

 WHEREAS, the Central Area Action Plan, adopted by the Seattle City Council through Resolution No. 28815 on January 3, 1994, recognized the Promenade 23 Shopping Center ("Center") as a critical neighborhood revitalization project; and

 WHEREAS, Ordinance 117877 authorized The City of Seattle to issue $2.4 million in non-recourse notes guaranteed by the Secretary of the Department of Housing and Urban Development ("HUD") under the Section 108 program to finance a loan ("Section 108 Loan") for expansion of the Center on the north side of Jackson St. in order to assist community and economic development in the Central Area;

 WHEREAS, the Section 108 Loan is secured by a first lien deed of trust on the property developed with that loan ("Section 108 Tract"), as specified by Section 4 of Ordinance 117877;

 WHEREAS, the City also holds a loan made from federal Urban Development Action Grant ("UDAG") funds for the development of the Center on the South side of Jackson St. (the "UDAG Loan");

 WHEREAS, under the terms of the UDAG loan as modified pursuant to Ordinance 115904, the City receives payments based on the net cash flow from the South portion of the Center after payment of debt service on a first mortgage from a private lender;

 WHEREAS, the UDAG loan modification agreement approved by Ordinance 115904 provided that the City would receive a deed of trust on the property North of Jackson Street as additional security until the Developer proceeded with development of the entire North side property, at which time such deed of trust would be released;

 WHEREAS, the owner of the Center ("Developer") has successfully completed the development financed by the Section 108 Loan under the federal Section 108 program;

 WHEREAS, the Developer has proposed a plan to refinance the private debt on the Center in order to reduce total debt service, improve cash flow and obtain a long-term fixed rate;

 WHEREAS, the Developer also intends to develop the remaining portion of the Center on the North side of Jackson St. ("Tract 2") with private financing;

 WHEREAS, the Director of the Office of Economic Development ("OED Director") has advised that refinancing as contemplated by the Developer's proposal will be in the best interests of the City, subject to certain conditions imposed by the Director, to negotiation of final terms, to review of appraisals and to necessary HUD approvals; NOW, THEREFORE,

 BE IT ORDAINED BY THE CITY OF SEATTLE AS FOLLOWS:

 Section 1. The Mayor or OED Director, or his or her designee, is authorized, for and on behalf of The City of Seattle, to negotiate, complete and implement a plan of refinancing of the Promenade 23 Shopping Center ("Plan"). The Plan may include the subordination of the deed of trust (and assignment of leases) securing the Section 108 Loan to a new first deed of trust, provided that the City shall obtain a second lien deed of trust on the portion of the Center South of Jackson Street as additional security for the Section 108 Loan. The Plan may also include subordination of the UDAG Deed of Trust to a third lien position, provided that the City's security for the UDAG Loan also shall include a third lien on the Section 108 Tract until such time as a sale or refinancing occurs on terms that will satisfy all obligations to the City or that are otherwise acceptable to the OED Director.

 Section 2. The authority to implement the Plan authorized in Section 1 is subject to the OED Director's satisfaction with new appraisals on the security property and the terms of final documents, and to the receipt of any necessary approvals from HUD.

In connection with any future sale or refinancing of any of the property held as security for the UDAG Loan and the Section 108 Loan, the Mayor or OED Director is authorized, for and on behalf of the City, and subject to receipt of any necessary HUD approvals, to release security in return for such payments and/or substitute security as he or she shall deem to be in the best interests of the City.

 Section 4. The Mayor, OED Director and Director of Housing and Human Services are authorized, for and on behalf of the City, to make such submissions to HUD and to execute, deliver, record, modify and administer such additional documents as may be necessary or appropriate to implement the authority granted by this Ordinance.

 Section 5. The Mayor or OED Director is authorized, for and on behalf of the City, to release Tract 2 from the lien of a deed of trust securing the UDAG Loan, and is further authorized to grant a partial release of the Section 108 Deed of Trust to conform the description of the Section 108 Tract to a lot boundary adjustment that has slightly reduced its size.

 Section 6. The authority granted herein is in addition to, and not in substitution for, authority previously granted in Ordinance 117887 and other ordinances.

 Section 7. Any actions pursuant to the authority granted by this Ordinance and prior to the effective date hereof are hereby ratified and confirmed.

 Section 8. This ordinance shall take effect and be in force thirty (30) days from and after its approval by the Mayor; but if not approved and returned by the Mayor within ten (10) days after presentation, it shall take effect as provided by Municipal Code Section 1.04.020.
