 AN ORDINANCE relating to Seattle Public Utilities; authorizing the execution of a purchase and sale agreement with The Trust for Public Land for sale of certain City property located in Ferry County, Washington; ratifying and confirming authority granted by Ordinance 116839 and Resolution 29657 with respect to sale of said property; and authorizing the conveyance of said property, execution of closing documents, and acceptance and deposit of funds in connection with the sale.

 WHEREAS, by 1983, the City acquired more than 17,500 acres of land ("City Lands") within the boundaries of four National Forests to exchange with the United States Forest Service for its lands within the Cedar River Watershed; and

 WHEREAS, in 1992, Congress passed and the President signed the Cedar River Watershed Land Exchange Act (Public Law 102-453) directing the Forest Service, upon agreement of the City, to complete the exchange under appraisal methods, deed restrictions, and other requirements set forth in the legislation; and

 WHEREAS, in 1993, in preparation for the exchange, Ordinance 116839 found and declared all of the City Lands to be surplus to the City's needs and not required for water utility service; and

 WHEREAS, Ordinance 116839 also granted authority for competitive or negotiated sale of any City Lands in excess of those required to complete the exchange, provided that the City Council adopts a resolution endorsing a list of properties eligible for disposition; and

 WHEREAS, in 1996, the City and the Forest Service closed the planned land exchange under terms of Public Law 102-453 with the City retaining more than 3,200 acres of its City Lands; and

 WHEREAS, in 1997, Resolution 29657 declared a list of all City Lands in excess of those required to complete the exchange, including the City Lands in Ferry County, Washington, to be eligible for disposition for purposes of activating the sale authority granted by Ordinance 116839, provided, however, that the final terms of any competitive or negotiated sale and the dedication of net proceeds are subject to approval by resolution of the City Council; and

 WHEREAS, representatives of Seattle Public Utilities and The Trust for Public Land have negotiated terms of sale of the excess City Lands in Ferry County, Washington, in the form of a purchase and sale agreement, for approval by the City Council as required by Resolution 29657; NOW, THEREFORE,
