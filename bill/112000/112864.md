 Section 2. Payment of Purchase Price.

 Purchaser agrees to pay to the City the sum of Six Hundred Thirteen Thousand Four Hundred Dollars ($613,400), payable in cash or cashier's check at the time of closing. The Earnest Money deposit paid by Purchaser may be credited to the purchase price at closing in accordance with the conditions described in Section 6 below.

 Section 3. Conveyance

 Upon the payment of the sum provided in Section 2 and all other amounts required to be paid by Purchaser hereunder, and upon the satisfaction of the conditions set forth in Section 5 below, the City shall convey title to the Property by special warranty deed in the form attached hereto as Attachment B (the "Deed"), which is hereby approved as to form by Purchaser.

 Section 4. Condition of Title; Title Insurance

 The City shall provide the Purchaser with an owner's policy of title insurance in standard form, at the City's expense. A preliminary title commitment shall be provided by the City for the Purchaser's inspection within thirty (30) days of execution of this Agreement. Purchaser shall review the preliminary title report, and in the event such examination discloses any liens, encumbrances or defects (collectively "exceptions") not acceptable to Purchaser, other than nondelinquent taxes and assessments and any easements, covenants and restrictions not inconsistent with the use contemplated herein, the Purchaser shall notify the City thereof in writing on or before fifteen (15) days after receipt of the preliminary title report. If Purchaser does not notify the City of any objections within such period then any objections to exceptions shown on the preliminary title report shall be deemed waived.

If Purchaser does not give written notice to the City, within fifteen (15) days after notice from the City to Purchaser that the City will not clear title of any exceptions objected to by Purchaser, that Purchaser elects to accept title subject to such exceptions, then at any time thereafter the City may return the Earnest Money and terminate this Agreement without any further obligation on either party.

 If Purchaser becomes aware of any change in the physical condition of the Property after the date hereof that would materially impair the development thereof as contemplated hereunder, or would substantially increase the cost of such development, Purchaser shall notify the City of such change. If any such change is caused by the acts of Purchaser or its agents, employees or contractors the Purchaser shall restore the Property to its prior condition. If Purchaser is not responsible under the preceding sentence then (1) if the City gives notice to Purchaser within ten (10) days after receiving notice of such change in condition that the City elects to remedy such changed condition, then this Agreement shall remain in effect and the City shall remedy such changed condition prior to closing, and (2) if the City does not give notice of such election, then Purchaser shall have the option, by notice to the City no later than twenty (20) days after giving notice to the City of such changed condition, to cancel this Agreement and receive a full refund of all Earnest Money, in which case neither party shall have any further obligation or liability to the other hereunder except for the express indemnities herein, which survive termination of this Agreement. Any notice from Purchaser to City hereunder that Purchaser is prepared to close the purchase shall constitute Purchaser's representation that it has reinspected the Property and agrees to accept it in its condition on the date of such notice, whether or not such condition has changed from the date hereof.

 Section 203. Possession

 Purchaser shall be entitled to exclusive possession of the Property (subject to the rights of the City contained herein) upon recording of the Deed.

 Subpart C: PLANS, APPROVALS, FINANCING AND CONSTRUCTION

 Section 301. Design and Schematic Plans

 Prior to conveyance of the Property, the Purchaser shall submit to City schematic designs and plans (herein "Schematic Plans") in sufficient detail with respect to development of the Property to clearly describe the site plan, architectural character, circulation, landscaping features and relationship to the surrounding environment of the Improvements.

 The Schematic Plans shall be in conformity with the Proposal, with Section 101 above, and with all applicable state and local laws and regulations, and shall be consistent with the design guidelines contained in the RFP. The Schematic Plans shall be submitted within thirty (30) days of execution of this Agreement. If Schematic Plans conforming to this Agreement are not submitted within such period, then after notice as set forth in Section 703 below the City shall have the right, by notice to Purchaser, to terminate this Agreement in which case the Earnest Money shall be retained by the City as liquidated damages, as the City's sole and exclusive remedy.

 The Schematic Plans shall be subject to review and approval by the Director as to conformity with this Agreement. The Director shall complete the Schematic Plans review within fifteen (15) working days of receipt of the Schematic Plans. If within such period, the City gives notice to Purchaser of changes reasonably required by the City, the Purchaser shall submit revised Schematic Plans reflecting such changes within fifteen (15) days after receipt of such notice. If the City does not give notice of any required changes within such period, and if the transmittal of such plans contained conspicuous notice on the first page thereof of the time limit for review hereunder, then the plans shall be deemed approved for purposes hereof unless they are manifestly inconsistent in material respects with the Proposal, Attachment C, or the Design Guidelines in the RFP.

 With the written consent of the Director or her designee, the Purchaser may elect to proceed directly to prepare and submit Construction Plans in lieu of Schematic Plans, provided that the Construction Plans shall contain all information required for Schematic Plans and shall be subject to review and revision as provided in this Section, which requirements and reviews shall be in addition to those provided in Section 302. As a condition of the Director's consent, Purchaser may be required to consent to a period for review of plans and notification of required changes longer than otherwise provided herein.

 Section 302. Construction Plans and Specifications

 Purchaser shall prepare plans and specifications with respect to the construction of Improvements ("Construction Plans") in conformity with the previously approved Schematic Plans, this Agreement and all applicable state and local laws and regulations.

Purchaser shall submit the Construction Plans, together with construction or progress schedule, to the Director, prior to the submission of the Construction Plans to the Department of Construction and Land Use ("DCLU").

 Purchaser shall submit Construction Plans to the Director within thirty (30) days of the City's approval of Schematic Plans and in any event within four (4) months of execution of this Agreement. If Construction Plans conforming to this Agreement are not submitted within such period, the City shall have the right, after notice as set forth in Section 703 below, to terminate this Agreement by notice to Purchaser, in which case the Earnest Money shall be retained by the City as liquidated damages, as the City's sole and exclusive remedy. If the City does not give notice of any required changes in Construction Plans within ten (10) working days of receipt thereof, and if the transmittal of such plans contained conspicuous notice on the first page thereof of the time limit for review hereunder, then the plans shall be deemed approved for purposes hereof unless they are manifestly inconsistent in material respects with the Schematic Plans. Final approval of the Construction Plans will be subject to acceptance by DCLU as evidenced by the issuance of the necessary permits for development and construction of the Improvements. As a condition precedent to the City's obligations hereunder, a building permit for construction must obtained within four (4) months of execution of this Agreement.

 Section 303. Changes in Construction Plans or Schematic Plans

 If Purchaser desires to make any material changes in the size, character, design, or exterior surface of structures or in the site plan, exterior elevation or materials as set forth in the Construction Plans and Schematic Plans or either of them after approval by the City, the Purchaser shall submit the proposed change to the Director for approval. If the Director finds that the Construction Plans and/or Schematic Plans as modified by the proposed change conform to the requirements of this Agreement, the Director shall approve the proposed change evidencing such approval by endorsement of the same on the revised plan sheets and by notifying the Purchaser and the DCLU Director in writing of the approval. Such changes in the Construction Plans and Schematic Plans or either of them shall in any event be approved or rejected in whole or in part, by written notice from the City to the Purchaser within ten (10) working days of submittal by the Purchaser.

 Section 304. Evidence for Financing

 Unless the Director shall have approved alternative financing arrangement proposed by the Purchaser, the Purchase shall, as a condition to City's obligations hereunder, provide the City, no later than December 31, 1999, evidence that firm financing commitments have been secured satisfactory to the Director and consistent with Section 5 of Part 1. If Purchaser fails to meet the deadline in the foregoing sentence, then the City may, by notice to Purchaser, terminate this Agreement, in which case the Earnest Money shall be returned to Purchaser and neither party shall have any liability hereunder except for any liability under indemnity or hold harmless provisions, which survive this Agreement. If the City does not give notice to Purchaser within fifteen (15) days after receipt of a copy of the financing commitment(s) that any terms thereof are not acceptable to City, then City shall be deemed to have approved the terms thereof except to the extent that any such terms are contrary to the provisions hereof.

 Section 305. Environmental Review

 Purchaser shall have the right, within three (3) months of the execution of this Agreement, to commission its own environmental investigation of the Property, at Purchaser's sole risk and expense. Purchaser shall defend, indemnify and hold harmless the City from any liability, loss, or damage resulting from the acts or omissions of Purchaser or its contractors or agents in connection with any such review. If Purchaser does commission such an investigation then Purchaser shall provide a copy of any reports generated thereby to the City.

 Section 306. Time for Construction

 Purchaser agrees that it shall commence the Improvements within ninety (90) days after Closing and diligently proceed to complete construction of the Improvements. Completion of construction shall be no later than thirteen (13) months after Closing. The work shall at all times be subject to inspection by the City.

 Subsequent to the conveyance of the Property to the Purchaser and until construction of the Improvements is complete, the Purchaser shall, within ten (10) days of any request by the City, forward to the Director a report in writing as to the actual construction progress.

 Section 308. Purpose of Review of Plans and Inspection of Work

 Review of plans and specifications and inspection of construction improvements, provided for in this contract, is for the sole purpose of evaluating compliance with the terms of this Agreement. Such inspection shall not be construed as a representation or warranty to Purchaser or any third party that the plans and specifications are adequate for any purpose, that there has been or will be compliance on the part of any contractor or subcontractor with the plans and specifications, that construction has been or will be free from faulty material or workmanship, or as to any other matter. Purchaser shall cause this Section 308 to be included in any contract for work into which Purchaser shall enter under this Agreement.

 Section 309. Certificate of Completion of Improvements

 A Certificate of Completion may be obtained only for the entire Property. Promptly after completion of the Improvements on the Property in accordance with the provisions of this Agreement and the approved Construction Plans, as confirmed by an inspection by the City, the City shall furnish the Purchaser with a Certificate of Completion ("Certificate" herein) substantially in the form attached hereto as Attachment D. A Certificate shall be issued when the Purchaser has completed the Improvements pursuant to the Construction Plans and has cured any deficiencies noted by the City in its inspections. Delivery of a Certificate and recording thereof by the Purchaser shall be conclusive evidence of satisfaction of obligations of the Purchaser to construct the Improvements and of the termination of the condition subsequent in the deed. Upon delivery of a Certificate, unless the City has already exercised its right to retain the Security Deposit for a breach or default on the part of Purchaser, the Security Deposit shall be returned to Purchaser.

 If the Director shall refuse or fail to provide a Certificate in accordance with the provisions of this Section 309, the Director shall, within seven (7) days after written request by the Purchaser made prior to the last date for completion of the Improvements hereunder, provide the Purchaser with a written statement indicating in adequate detail in what respects the Purchaser has failed to complete the Improvements in accordance with the provisions of this Agreement, or is otherwise in default, and what measures or acts will be necessary, in the opinion of the Director, for the Purchaser to take or to cause to be taken to obtain such Certificate. When such acts or measures have been completed and the City has reinspected the Property to confirm such completion the Certificate shall be issued.

 Section 310. Entry; Sign

 From the date of execution of this Agreement by both parties through Closing or the date of termination of this Agreement, as the case may be, Purchaser and Purchaser's agents shall have the ongoing right, upon no less than twenty-four hours advance notice to the Director, to enter on the Property for the purpose of inspections, to conduct studies, clear underbrush and for all other purposes that Purchaser deems reasonably necessary for the planning or design of the Improvements, and to commission Purchaser's own environmental investigation of the Property, and Purchaser's own engineering and other studies, all at Purchaser's sole risk and expense. No excavations or other activities that require a permit under applicable City Codes or regulations shall be conducted unless Purchaser obtains such a permit at its sole expense and complies with all conditions thereof. Purchaser agrees that the City and its officers, employees and agents shall not be liable to Purchaser for any injury to persons or property on or about the Property in connection with activities pursuant to this subsection, whether or not due to any condition of the Property or due to any negligence of the City or its officers, employees or agents. Unless otherwise expressly authorized by the Director, Purchaser shall promptly restore the Property to the condition it was in prior to any activities undertaken pursuant to this subsection. Purchaser shall defend, indemnify and hold harmless the City from any liability, loss, or damage (including costs and attorneys fees) resulting from the acts or omissions of Purchaser or its contractors or agents in connection with any such inspection, investigation, studies or related activities on or about the Property. Any contract entered into by Purchaser for any consultants' services shall expressly provide that the City shall have no obligation thereunder and that the charges for such services shall not be a lien on the Property unless and until Purchaser shall have completed the purchase thereof from the City. If Purchaser does commission any such investigations or studies then Purchaser shall provide copies of any reports generated thereby to the City.

 Purchaser shall have the right to install a sign on the Property, at its own risk and expense to give public notice of its permit application as required by City ordinance. Purchaser shall install and maintain such sign in conformity with all applicable City ordinances and rules and shall remove it promptly upon the request of the City if this Agreement shall be terminated.

 Subpart D: SPECIAL CONDITIONS

 Section 401. Local Business Enterprise Participation

 A. Purchaser shall comply with the Purchaser's commitment ("LBE Commitment") as stated in the Sworn Statement for Commitment to Local Business Enterprise Participation (Attached hereto as Attachment E), which is hereby incorporated by reference, for all construction of the Improvements. Failure to comply with the LBE Commitment shall be a material breach of this Agreement.

 B. In connection with the construction of the Improvements, Purchaser shall:

 (1) Fulfill the LBE Commitment;

 (2) Report in writing to the City on a monthly basis during construction as to the total dollar amount of construction contracts signed for the Improvements, and the total amount signed with Local Business Enterprises ("LBEs") as defined in the RFP;

 (3) Maintain records reasonably necessary for monitoring compliance with the LBE Commitment, including original contracts and payment records, and permit inspection of such records by the City for up to one year after completion of the Improvements.

 C. The parties agree that Purchaser's LBE Commitment is a significant inducement to the City to sign this Agreement and that the City would be seriously damaged by a failure to meet this commitment, in view of the strong public interest in promoting business opportunities in economically depressed areas of the City, but that the amount of damage will be difficult to measure in dollar terms. The parties therefore agree that if Purchaser fails to meet its LBE Commitment, Purchaser shall pay to the City on demand, as liquidated damages and not as a penalty, the dollar amount by which Purchaser's LBE Commitment exceeded the actual amount of work on the Improvements awarded to LBEs.

 The parties agree that such amount will be a reasonable approximation of the damage to the City from failure to satisfy the LBE Commitment. The City may, but shall not be required to, apply the Security Deposit to payment of such liquidated damages. If liquidated damages are paid under this Section, Purchaser shall have no other liability for failure to meet the commitment for which liquidated damages are paid, provided that Purchaser may be subject to non-monetary administrative sanctions relating to further contracting opportunities with the City. If Purchaser fails to pay liquidated damages within 30 days after a demand by the City, Purchaser shall be subject to all remedies for breach hereunder, including without limitation those referred to in Section 704.

 Subpart E: PROHIBITIONS AGAINST ASSIGNMENT AND TRANSFER

 Section 501. Intent of Purchaser.

 Purchaser represents and agrees that the purchase of the Property is for the purpose of immediate development of the Improvements and not for speculation in land holding.

 Section 502. Prohibition Against Transfer of Property and Assignment of Agreement.

 Purchaser represents and agrees that:

 A. Purchaser has not made or created or suffered to be made or created any assignment, conveyance, mortgage, lease, trust, power or transfer, of any sort, of this agreement or any interest herein, or any interest in or relating to the Property, or entered into any agreement or contract to do any of the foregoing and (except as authorized by Sections 601-605 herein) Purchaser shall not do any of the foregoing prior to issuance of a Certificate of Completion of the Improvements without the prior written approval of the City, which may be withheld in the City's sole discretion.

 B. In order to request City approval for any transaction of the type referenced in Subsection A above, Purchaser shall submit to the City all documents relating to the proposed transactions and such information concerning the proposed transferee as the City shall request. If the City approves the transaction, as a condition of such approval, the transferee shall assume all obligations of Purchaser hereunder and shall agree to comply with such other conditions the City may find desirable in order to achieve and safeguard the purposes of this Agreement. This Subsection B shall not apply to mortgages or deeds of trust as authorized in Section 601 below.

 C. In the absence of specific written agreement by the City to the contrary, no transfer or approval thereof by the City shall be deemed to relieve Purchaser, or any other party bound in any way by this Agreement or otherwise with respect to the construction of the Improvements, from any of its obligations with respect thereto.

 Subpart F: MORTGAGE FINANCING; RIGHTS OF MORTGAGEES

 Section 601. Limitation Upon Encumbrance of Property

 Prior to the issuance of a Certificate of Completion for the Improvements, the Purchaser shall not engage in any financing or any other transaction creating any mortgage or other encumbrance or lien upon the Property without the express written consent of the City, except for financing documents substantially as contemplated in a financing commitment approved or deemed approved by the City hereunder, for acquisition of the Property and construction of the Improvements. The Purchaser shall notify the City in advance of any financing secured by mortgage or other similar lien instrument, that Purchaser proposes to enter into with respect to the Property, or any part thereof, and in any event Purchaser shall promptly notify the City of any encumbrance or lien that has been created on or attached to the Property or any parcel thereof, whether by voluntary act of the Purchaser or otherwise.

 Section 602. Mortgagee Not Obligated to Construct

 Notwithstanding any of the provisions of this Agreement, the holder of any mortgage authorized by this Agreement (including any such holder who obtains title to the Property or any part thereof as a result of foreclosure proceedings, or action in lieu thereof) shall in no case be obligated by the provisions of this Agreement to construct or complete the Improvements or to guarantee such construction or completion; nor shall any covenant or any other provision in the Deed be construed to so obligate such holder: Provided, That nothing in this Section or any other Section or provision of this Agreement shall be deemed or construed to permit or authorize any such holder to devote the Property or any part thereof to any uses, or to construct any improvements thereon, other than those uses or improvements described in the Development Plan.

 Section 603. Copy of Notice of Default to Mortgagee

 Whenever the City shall deliver any notice or demand to the Purchaser with respect to any breach or default by the Purchaser in its obligations or covenants under the Agreement, the City shall at the same time forward a copy of such notice or demand to each holder of any mortgage authorized by the Agreement which holder has been identified to the City in writing by Purchaser, at the last address of such holder shown in the records of the City.

 Section 604. Mortgagee's Option To Cure Defaults

 After any breach or default referred to in Section 603 hereof, each such holder shall (insofar as the rights of the City are concerned) have the right, at its option, to cure or remedy such breach or default and to add the reasonable cost thereof to the mortgage debt and the lien of its mortgage: Provided, That if the breach or default is with respect to construction of the Improvements, nothing contained in the Agreement shall be deemed to permit or authorize such holder to undertake or continue the construction or completion of improvements on the Property (beyond the extent necessary to conserve or protect Improvements or construction already made) except for completion of the Improvements substantially as provided pursuant to this Agreement. In the case of any breach or default occurring after Purchaser shall have acquired the Property and shall have granted a mortgage or deed of trust in favor of an institutional lender, then such lender shall have an additional 30 days to cure such breach or default after the expiration of any cure period allowed to Purchaser, and if the breach or default cannot reasonably be cured within such 30-day period then the additional period of cure allowed to the lender shall be extended for such time as is reasonably required to cure such breach or default, provided that the lender shall give notice of its intent to cure and commence cure within such 30-day period and continue diligently to pursue such cure.

 Section 605. Mortgage and Holder

 For the purposes of the Agreement the term "mortgage" shall include a deed of trust or other instrument creating an encumbrance or lien upon the Property, or any part thereof, as security for a loan. The term "holder" in reference to a mortgage shall include any insurer or guarantor (other than a partner, shareholder or principal of Purchaser) of any obligation or condition secured by such mortgage or deed of trust.

 Subpart G: DEFAULT AND REMEDIES

 Section 701. In General

 Except as otherwise provided in this Agreement, in the event of any default in or breach of this Agreement, or any of its terms or conditions, by any party hereto, or any successor to a party, such party (or successor) shall, upon written notice from the other, proceed immediately to cure or remedy such default or breach, and, in any event, shall complete such cure within sixty (60) days after receipt of such notice or such shorter period as may be provided herein. In case such action is not taken or not diligently pursued, or the default or breach shall not be cured or remedied within the time permitted hereunder, the aggrieved party may pursue any remedies available at law or in equity, subject to the specific limitations herein.

 Section 702. Termination By Fault of City Prior to Conveyance of Property

 In the event that any of the following occurs prior to conveyance of the Property:

 A. The City fails to tender conveyance of the Property in the manner required herein after satisfaction of the conditions provided in this Agreement and notice to close from Purchaser as specified herein, and any such failure shall not be cured within sixty (60) days after notice from the Purchaser; or

 B. The City fails or refuses to approve Purchaser's Schematic Plans or Construction Plans pursuant to the terms of this contract without a statement of reasons for such refusal; or

 C. The City otherwise fails or refuses, after thirty (30) days' notice and opportunity to cure, to carry out the terms and conditions of this Agreement prior to Closing;

 then at the option of Purchaser this Agreement shall be terminated by written notice thereof to the City, Purchaser shall receive a full refund of the Earnest Money and Purchaser shall have the right, as its sole remedy, to proceed against the City for actual damages limited to an additional amount equal to the Earnest Money.

 Section 703. Termination by Fault of Purchaser Prior to Conveyance of Property

 In the event that prior to the conveyance of the Property to Purchaser:

 A. Purchaser (or any successor in interest) assigns or attempts to assign this Agreement or any rights therein or in the Property without the express consent of the City; or

 B. Purchaser does not submit Schematic Plans, or does not submit Construction Plans, as required by this Agreement, or does not obtain a building permit for construction of the Improvements, in each case in the manner and by the dates respectively provided in this Agreement, and such failure shall not be cured within fifteen (15) days after the date of written demand by the City; or

 C. Purchaser, without legal excuse, gives notice that it will be unable or unwilling to close the Purchase as provided herein; or

 D. Purchaser, without legal excuse, does not tender the full consideration for and take title to the Property, and perform all other obligations of Purchaser at Closing upon tender of conveyance by the City pursuant to this Agreement; or

 E. Purchaser, without legal excuse, fails to give written notice of intent to close pursuant to Section 7.A of Part I hereof at least ten (10) days in advance of the last date for closing specified in such Section, notwithstanding the satisfaction of all conditions to Purchaser's obligation to close except those to be satisfied at Closing; or

 F. Purchaser, without legal excuse, otherwise fails to comply with the terms of this Agreement prior to Closing;

 then at the option of the City this Agreement and any rights of Purchaser in this Agreement or arising therefrom with respect to the City or the Property shall be terminated, in which event the Earnest Money shall be retained by the City as liquidated damages, as the sole and exclusive remedy available to the City, and neither Purchaser nor the City shall have any further rights against or liability to the other under this Agreement (except pursuant to indemnity provisions, which survive termination of this Agreement).

 Section 704. Reversion of Title to City Upon Failure to Complete Improvements or Certain Other Events Subsequent to Conveyance to Purchaser

 A. The City is selling the Property for the purpose of the prompt construction of the Improvements and in reliance on the covenants of Purchaser that such Improvements will be constructed. Therefore, as set forth in the Deed, the conveyance of the Property to Purchaser shall be subject to a condition subsequent to the effect that in the event of failure to complete the Improvements in a timely manner or upon the occurrence of other events described therein prior to completion of the Improvements, and after failure on the part of Purchaser to cure or remedy such failure or other event within the period (if any) and in the manner stated in the Deed, the City at its option may declare a termination of all the rights and interests in and to the Property conveyed by the Deed to Purchaser, and that such title and interests to and in the Property shall vest in the City, upon which all rights of Purchaser (and all persons claiming through Purchaser) in and to the Property and possession thereof shall cease;

 Provided, that such condition subsequent and any reverting of title as a result thereof in the City (1) shall always be subordinate to and limited by, and shall not defeat, render invalid, or limit in any way, (i) the lien of any mortgage authorized by the City pursuant to this Agreement, and (ii) any rights or interests provided in this Agreement for the protection of the holders of such mortgages; and (2) shall not apply to the Property once the Improvements to be constructed have been completed in accordance with this Agreement and a Certificate has been issued for the Property as provided in Section 309 hereof.

 B. If the City exercises its right to revest title to the City pursuant to this section, the City shall return to Purchaser, without interest, all funds paid by Purchaser to the City for the Property, after deducting (1) any amounts used to pay off liens incurred or permitted by Purchaser; (2) the City's expenses related to this transaction; and (3) any amount by which the appraised value of the Property at the time of reversion to the City is exceeded by the price paid by Purchaser.

 C. In addition to, and not in the alternative to, the City's power of termination as provided for above, the City shall have the right, at any time when the City would have the right to declare a termination of Purchaser's interest under the terms of the Deed, by notice to Purchaser and Escrow Agent, to elect to retain the Security Deposit or obtain payment on any bond provided in lieu thereof, in either case without any deduction, offset or recoupment whatsoever, as liquidated damages in the event of default, violation or failure of the Purchaser as specified in this section. If the City makes such election to retain the Security Deposit or realize on the bond, then Purchaser shall have an additional (thirty (30)) days beyond the time specified in the Deed to remedy the failure or event giving rise to the City's right to terminate Purchaser's interest, prior to exercise of the City's power of termination.

 Section 705. Other Rights and Remedies; No Waiver of Delay

 Either party shall have the right to institute such actions or proceedings as it may deem desirable for effectuating its remedies. Any delay by either party in instituting or prosecuting any such actions or proceedings or otherwise asserting its rights under this Agreement shall not operate as a waiver of any rights or remedies or to deprive it of or limit such rights or remedies in any way; nor shall any waiver in fact made with respect to any specific default be considered or treated as a waiver of the rights or remedies of either party with respect to any other defaults or with respect to the particular default except to the extent specifically waived in writing.

 which real property is hereinafter referred to collectively as "the Property."

 The Grantor covenants that it will forever warrant and defend title to the above-described real property against all persons lawfully claiming or to claim by, through or under Grantor. Grantee's title shall not be subject to the restrictions imposed under the Urban Renewal Plan adopted by Grantor and recorded September 22, 1970 under King County Auditor's file no. 6696014, or any amendments thereto. Grantor hereby expressly limits the covenants and warranties of this deed to those herein expressed, and does hereby exclude all covenants and warranties arising or to arise by statutory or other implication.

 Condition Subsequent. This deed and all rights of Grantee hereunder are subject to a condition subsequent upon the occurrence of which Grantor or its governmental successors or assigns shall have the absolute right, subject only to the express limitations set forth herein, to terminate, by notice to Grantee or by reentering and taking possession of the Property (or one or more Parcels thereof, if the legal description designates separate Parcels or if the Contract provides for the division of the Property into Parcels), the estate conveyed under this deed and all rights of all persons claiming by or through Grantee, whereupon fee simple title to the Property (or to one or more Parcels thereof, if the condition subsequent shall have terminated as to the other Parcel or Parcels) shall revest entirely in Grantor or its governmental successors or assigns.

 Notwithstanding the foregoing, the condition subsequent and any revesting of title as a result thereof in the Grantor (1) shall always be subject to and limited by, and shall not defeat, render invalid or limit in any way (a) the lien of any mortgage or deed of trust permitted by the Contract, and (b) any rights or interest provided in the Contract for the protection of the holders of such mortgages or deeds of trust; and (2) shall not apply to the Property once a Certificate of Completion has been issued as provided below.

 DEVELOPMENT PLAN YESLER_ATLANTIC PARCEL 23-23A

 John C. Cannon Assisted and Retirement Living Facility 23rd Avenue and East Yesler Way

 PROJECT DESCRIPTION:

 The John C. Cannon project is a new construction project, which will be located on the City-owned Yesler-Atlantic Parcel 23-23A. The project will contain 96 studio units providing assisted living for the elderly. The ground floor will contain a "wellness center" to serve the residents of the housing units and, if any necessary rezone is obtained, to serve the greater community.

 Based on preliminary plans, and subject to the City permitting and design review processes:

 The facility will consist of 57,000 square feet modulated to appear like two buildings divided with an open breezeway separating the spaces at grade with a glass and metal clad enclosed hallway at the second and third levels. The facility will have 3 and 4 stories with 1 story below grade at 23 Avenue S. The main famayade will be oriented to 23 Avenue S and will present a multi-family residence appearance with minimal vehicular access, primarily limited to resident pick-up and drop-off. Parking will be underground, accessed on 22nd Avenue S. A limited number of surface parking stalls will be provided on 23rd Avenue S. A courtyard will open to 22nd Avenue S. and landscaping and street trees are included in the development.

 The Purchaser, the nonprofit African-American Community Health Network, will own the facility and contract its management to Emeritus Assisted Living, which operates 138 properties in 28 states.

 The Cannon project is proposed to be financed by the State Housing Assistance Program; a private lender; cash from Columbia Pacific Management Corporation, a corporation related to Emeritus Assisted Living; and City housing funds. No City funds have yet been approved, and the Purchaser's obligations under the Contract for Sale are not conditioned upon availability of such funds.

 SERVICES PROVIDED:

 Basic services provided to residents will include 3 nutritious meals per day, snacks, security, weekly housekeeping, bed and bath linen changes, scheduled transportation, and social and recreational activities. Individualized higher levels of care will be offered in packages ranging from medication management and assistance with special diets, to 24-hour hands-on assistance with personal care needs.
