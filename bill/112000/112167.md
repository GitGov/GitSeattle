 AN ORDINANCE relating to the Community Development Block Grant Float Loan Program; authorizing a short-term loan of up to One Million Dollars ($1,000,000) in Block Grant funds to On The Boards, a Washington nonprofit corporation, for an economic development project involving the refinance and rehabilitation of the Queen Anne Hall; and authorizing an amendment to the City of Seattle's 1998 Consolidated Plan.

 WHEREAS, the City Council, by Ordinance 116402, adopted policies for short-term loans of Community Development Block Grant ("CDBG") funds, known as "CD Float Loans"; and

 WHEREAS, the City's Director of the Office of Economic Development has identified an economic development project in which the City would provide a short term loan (the "Loan") to On The Boards to refinance and rehabilitate the Queen Anne Hall building which it will use to create performance and retail space, thereby creating employment within the City primarily for low- and moderate-income persons, which job creation will satisfy the CD Float Loan policies, and the City's Loan Committee has approved the proposed loan in accordance with those policies; and

 WHEREAS, as part of this economic development project, On The Boards will agree to direct certain of its performance and/or instructional activities to continue and strengthen existing relationships with theater organizations benefiting the Central and Southeast areas of Seattle; and

 WHEREAS, the City's Comprehensive Plan (G17) states that the City should preserve developments of historic, architectural or social significance that contribute to the identity of an area; and

 WHEREAS, the preservation of the Queen Anne Hall as a performance facility meets the intent of the City's Comprehensive Plan; and

 WHEREAS, the making of the proposed Loan will not impair the implementation of other projects or programs of the City using CDBG funds; and

 WHEREAS, the expansion of the performance arts and its linkage to the Central and Southeast areas of Seattle are important policies of the City; NOW, THEREFORE,

The Director of the Office of Economic Development ("OED Director") is authorized, for and on behalf of The City of Seattle, to lend up to ONE MILLION DOLLARS ($1,000,000) of CDBG funds, subject to receipt of sufficient funds from HUD (together with any available program income), to On The Boards, a Washington nonprofit corporation, for refinancing and rehabilitating the Queen Anne Hall located at 100 West Roy Street, subject to the terms and conditions stated in this ordinance. The amount of up to ONE MILLION DOLLARS ($ 1,000,000) is hereby appropriated from the Housing and Community Development Revenue Sharing Fund for such purpose. The City Council determines that such financing is necessary and appropriate to achieve the City's community development objectives.

 Section 2. The Loan shall be payable upon the earlier of two years or demand by the City. The Loan shall bear interest at an appropriate rate to be determined by the OED Director, not to exceed four percent (4%) per annum payable monthly. The OED Director may require a loan fee, payable to the City, not to exceed 1.0 % of the maximum Loan amount, which fee shall be deposited in the Housing and Community Development Revenue Sharing Fund. The OED Director is authorized to cause all or a portion of such fee to be (a) paid to the National Development Council ("NDC") in accordance with an existing contract under which NDC develops and facilitates eligible CD Float Loan projects; (b) applied to legal and other costs related to the administration of the transaction authorized by this ordinance; and/or (c) applied to payment of expenses incurred in the administration of any federally funded economic development loan projects or programs administered by the OED Director. The amount of up to TEN THOUSAND DOLLARS ($ 10,000) is hereby appropriated for such purposes from the Housing and Community Development Revenue Sharing Fund, subject to receipt of such funds in payment of the loan fee.

 Section 3. The Loan shall be secured by an irrevocable letter of credit that shall have an outstanding balance, at all times, at least equal to the outstanding principal amount and accrued interest, plus all additional interest that will accrue for the next 30 days. The letter of credit shall be issued by a commercial bank satisfactory to the OED Director and shall be in form and content satisfactory to the OED Director.

 Section 4. Disbursement of the Loan shall be conditioned upon satisfactory environmental review in accordance with HUD requirements; execution and delivery by On The Boards of a job creation agreement and upon other conditions required by law or deemed appropriate by the OED Director.

 Section 6. The OED Director is hereby authorized to take such other actions and execute and deliver such other documents as shall be reasonably necessary or appropriate to carry out the intent of this ordinance.

 Section 7. Payments of principal and interest on the Loan shall be deposited in the Housing and Community Development Revenue Sharing Fund, and may be expended pursuant to any past or future appropriations of CDBG funds, whether in the annual budget or otherwise, unless such other appropriations are limited by their express terms to CDBG program income from other programs.

 Section 8. The Director of the Department of Housing and Human Services is authorized to amend the City of Seattle's 1998 Consolidated Plan and to take such other actions as are appropriate to implement the intent of this ordinance under HUD regulations, and to provide necessary assurances to the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development.
