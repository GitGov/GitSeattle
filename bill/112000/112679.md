 AN ORDINANCE amending Seattle's SEPA ordinance, SMC 25.05.675, to provide for additional environmental review of proposed development within Seattle's shoreline zones, and declaring an emergency requiring a vote of the Seattle City Council so that the Ordinance may take effect immediately.

 BE IT ORDAINED BY THE CITY OF SEATTLE AS FOLLOWS:

 Section 1. The City Council hereby makes the following legislative findings of fact and declarations:

 1. Seattle's existing SEPA ordinance applies the City's "Overview Policy" to proposed development within the City's shoreline zones, thereby limiting the extent to which the City's SEPA policies for the protection of "Plants and Animals" may be applied to proposed development within the shoreline.

 2. In 1999 the National Marine Fisheries Service listed chinook salmon as a threatened species pursuant to the requirements of the Endangered Species Act.

 3. In light of that listing, and in order to enhance the protection of plant and animal life within the City's shorelines, the Council intends to provide for full application of the City's SEPA policies within the shorelines, unrestricted by the limitations contained in the Overview Policy.

 4. If the repeal of the Overview Policy as it pertains to the City's SEPA policies for "Plants and Animals" does not become effective for several months, due to the standard procedures applicable to ordinance adoption, development projects may become vested, thereby thwarting the Council's intent to fully apply the City's authority to protect threatened species and other important animals and plants.

 5. If development projects become vested, uses may be permanently established which are inimical to the public health, safety, and welfare. Because the acquisition of vested rights may be imminent, an emergency exists which requires the adoption of this interim ordinance.

 10. The City has legal authority to adopt this interim ordinance pursuant to the authority granted by Article 11, Section 11 of the Washington Constitution, the Growth Management Act, RCW 36.70A.390, and Matson v. Clark County, 79 Wn. App. 641 (1995).

 Section 2. SMC 25.05.675 (N) is hereby amended to read as follows:

 N. Plants and Animals.

 1. Policy Background.

 a. Many species of birds, mammals, fish, and other classes of animals and plants living in the urban environments are of aesthetic, educational, ecological and in some cases economic value.

 b. Local wildlife populations are threatened by habitat loss through destruction and fragmentation of living and breeding areas and travelways, and by the reduction of habitat diversity.

 c. Substantial protection of wildlife habitats and travel corridors within the City is provided by the Seattle Shoreline Master Program.

 2. Policies.

 a. It is the City's policy to minimize or prevent the loss of wildlife habitat and other vegetation which have substantial aesthetic, educational, ecological, and/or economic value. A high priority shall be given to the preservation and protection of special habitat types. Special habitat types include, but are not limited to, wetlands and associated areas (such as upland nesting areas), and spawning, feeding, or nesting sites. A high priority shall also be given to meeting the needs of state and federal threatened, endangered, and sensitive species of both plants and animals.

 b. For projects which are proposed within an identified plant or wildlife habitat or travelway, the decisionmaker shall assess the extent of adverse impacts and the need for mitigation.

 c. When the decisionmaker finds that a proposed project would reduce or damage rare, uncommon, unique or exceptional plant or wildlife habitat, wildlife travelways, or habitat diversity for species (plants or animals) of substantial aesthetic, educational, ecological or economic value, the decisionmaker may condition or deny the project to mitigate its adverse impacts. Such conditioning or denial is permitted whether or not the project meets the criteria of the Overview Policy set forth in SMC Section 25.05.665~~.~~~~~~

 d. Mitigating measures may include but are not limited to:

 i. Relocation of the project on the site;

 ii. Reducing the size or scale of the project;

 iii. Preservation of specific on-site habitats, such as trees or vegetated areas;

 iv. Limitations on the uses allowed on the site;

 v. Limitations on times of operation during periods significant to the affected species (i.e., spawning season, mating season, etc.); and

 vi. Landscaping and/or retention of existing vegetation.

 Section 3. This ordinance shall become effective immediately upon the approval or signing of the ordinance by the Mayor or passage over his veto, as provided by the Charter of the City.
