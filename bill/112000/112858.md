In such event, Purchaser may submit a revised MUP Application to the Director for the purpose set forth above. If the revised MUP Application fails to substantially conform to the Schematic Design, the Director shall so notify Purchaser in writing, providing a statement of exactly what changes the Director believes are required to bring the MUP Application into substantial conformance with the Schematic Design. The Purchaser may within sixty (60) days thereafter submit a second revised MUP Application. If Purchaser fails to submit such a second revised MUP Application or the second revised MUP Application does not substantially conform to the Schematic Design, then the City may terminate this Agreement by written notice to Purchaser and the Escrow Agent, such written notice of termination to be provided within fifteen (15) business days of receipt of the second revised MUP Application, in which case the Earnest Money be retained by the City as liquidated damages and as the City's sole and exclusive remedy (provided that this Agreement shall remain in full force and effect as to those Lots for which Closing has occurred), and neither party shall have any further liability or obligation, of any kind whatsoever, to the other under this Agreement.

The MUP Application shall be superceded by the MUP when issued by DCLU, provided that the Director has approved the changes required by DCLU, as described in Section 305.

 Section 303. Phased Construction

 The parties acknowledge and understand that the Improvements will be constructed in four (4) phases corresponding to the phased purchase of the Lots as described in Exhibit VI (Lot Price and Closing Schedule) provided for hereunder and that such phased purchase of the Lots and phased construction of the Improvements is anticipated to occur over the period of four (4) years from the date of this Agreement. The Office of Housing wishes to support the successful development of the Property, and encourages the Purchaser to consolidate the construction of the Improvements into fewer phases, and over a shorter period of time, if the market demand for the commercial and residential space is strong, and the financing is available to support expedited construction of the Improvements.

 PART III - GENERAL

 SUBPART 400 - REGULATORY CONDITIONS

 Section 401. Non-Discrimination

 The Purchaser shall not create barriers to open and fair opportunities for women and minority-owned businesses ("WMBEs ") to participate in contracts and to obtain or compete for contracts and subcontracts as sources of supplies, equipment, construction and services related to the development of the Property. In considering offers from and doing business with contractors and suppliers, the Purchaser shall not discriminate on the basis of race, color, creed, religion, sex, age, nationality, marital status, sexual orientation or the presence of any mental or physical disability in an otherwise qualified disabled person.

 SUBPART 500 - PROHIBITIONS AGAINST ASSIGNMENT AND TRANSFER

 Section 501. Use of Improvements

 Purchaser represents and agrees that the purchase of the Property is for the purpose of phased development (as shown on the Master Development Schedule Exhibit IX) of mixed-use buildings which include approximately one hundred twenty six (126) residential live/work loft units above approximately thirty thousand (30,000) square feet of commercial space, and not for speculation in land holding.

 Purchaser's goal is to provide residential live/work lofts for homebuyers, including but not limited to artists, in a range of prices including, low, moderate and market-rate. Artist's incomes are generally in the low to moderate range, and as such, a subsidy is required to close the gap between the cost of producing a residential unit and the ability of an artist to afford it. The Property is located in a City designated Special Objectives Area and Purchaser intends to apply for City's Multifamily Property Tax Exemption Program as an additional method for increasing affordability. To qualify, the Project will require approval from DCLU and City Council. As a condition of approval for the Multifamily Property Tax Exemption Program, twenty five percent (25%) of the residential units in the redevelopment project must serve those at 80% or less of median income.

 Purchaser will actively seek public and private sources of downpayment assistance funds as a way to help close the gap in affordability for the residential portion of the redevelopment project. If such downpayment assistance funds are not available or the amounts available are reduced, then the number of low and moderate income residential units may decrease as a result.

 Should special financing become available for rentals, such as the Low Income Tax credit program, for example, Purchaser may elect to operate a portion of the residential units as rentals for a period of time.

 Purchaser's goal for the commercial portion is to provide a portion of the commercial uses, such as a cafint/deli, that will be an asset to the residents of the redevelopment project and the Jackson Place Neighborhood. Purchaser will actively pursue other retail, arts- oriented and professional uses.

 Should the Purchaser determine it is necessary to revise the use of the improvements described above, in order to improve the economic feasibility of the development project, so that the development does not provide a portion of the live/work lofts for artists, is not a mixed-income housing project, does not include homeownership, or the use of the commercial space will not include services that would benefit the neighborhood, the Purchaser shall submit an explanation and proposal for a revised use of Improvements to the Director, and secure the approval of the Director for such revised use of Improvements, which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld.

 Nothing contained herein shall prohibit Purchaser from operating all or a portion of the redevelopment project as rentals, upon written approval from the Director, which shall not be unreasonably withheld.

 Section 502. Transfer of Property and Assignment of Agreement

 Purchaser represents and agrees that:

 Purchaser has not made or created or suffered to be made or created any assignment, conveyance, mortgage, lease, trust, power or transfer, of any sort, of this Agreement or any interest herein, or any interest in or relating to the Property, or entered into any agreement or contract to do any of the foregoing and, except as otherwise provided in this Section or as authorized by Sections 601-605 or Section 704 herein, Purchaser shall not do any of the foregoing prior to issuance of a Certificate of Completion without the prior written approval of the City, which may be withheld in the City's sole discretion; provided that this Subsection A does not apply to leases of space within the Improvements to tenants.

 Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, the City consents to the assignment and transfer all of the rights, duties and obligations of Purchaser under this Agreement and in the Property, or any Lot or Lots thereof to entities formed by Icon Architecture, Ltd or its shareholders for the purpose of development of the Property.

 In order to request City approval for any transaction of the type referenced in Subsection A above requiring such approval, Purchaser shall submit to the City all documents relating to the proposed transaction and such information concerning the proposed transferee as the City shall request. If the City approves the transaction, as a condition of such approval, the transferee shall assume all obligations of Purchaser hereunder and shall agree to comply with such other conditions the City may find desirable in order to achieve and safeguard the purposes of this Agreement. This Subsection C shall not apply to mortgages or deeds of trust granted to Bank as authorized in Section 601 below.

 Except as otherwise provided in Subsection B above, in the absence of a specific written agreement by the City to the contrary, no transfer or approval thereof by the City shall be deemed to relieve Purchaser, or any other party bound in any way by this Agreement or otherwise with respect to the construction of the Improvements, from any of its obligations with respect thereto.

 SUBPART 600 - MORTGAGE FINANCING; RIGHTS OF MORTGAGEES

 Section 601. Limitation Upon Encumbrance of Property

 Prior to the issuance of a Certificate of Completion for the Improvements, Purchaser shall not engage in any financing or any other transaction creating any mortgage or other encumbrance or lien upon the Property without the express written consent of the Director, except for Mortgages contemplated under Section 605 and other financing documents substantially as contemplated in a Financing Commitment from the Lender(s), approved or deemed approved by the City pursuant to Section 309 hereof, for acquisition of the Property and construction of the Improvements (the "Approved Financing").

 Purchaser shall notify Office of Housing in advance of any proposed financing other than the Approved Financing, secured by mortgage or other similar lien instrument, that Purchaser proposes to enter into with respect to the Lots or any part thereof (the "Proposed Financing"), and shall promptly notify the Director of any encumbrance or lien that has been created on or attached to the Property, whether by voluntary act of Purchaser or otherwise.

 Section 604. Mortgagee's Option To Cure Defaults

In the case of any breach or default occurring after Purchaser shall have acquired the Property and shall have granted a mortgage or deed of trust in favor of Holder, Holder shall have an additional thirty (30) days to cure such breach or default after the expiration of any cure period allowed to Purchaser, and if the breach or default cannot reasonably be cured within such thirty (30) day period then the additional period of cure allowed to Holder shall be extended for such time by the City as is reasonably required to cure such breach or default, provided that Holder shall give notice of its intent to cure and commence cure within such thirty (30) day period and continue diligently to pursue such cure.

 Section 605. Mortgage and Holder

 For the purposes of the Agreement, the term "Mortgage" shall include a deed of trust or other instrument creating an encumbrance or lien upon the Property, or any part thereof, as security for a loan.

 Purchaser, without legal excuse, otherwise fails to comply with the terms of or is in default or breach of this Agreement prior to Closing; or;

 There are multiple failures by Purchaser to comply in material respects with the terms and conditions of this Agreement and such failures are not promptly corrected to the satisfaction of the City,

 then at the option of the City this Agreement and any rights of Purchaser or of any assignee or transferee in this Agreement or arising therefrom with respect to the City or the Property shall be terminated upon receipt by Purchaser of written notice of such termination, the Earnest Money shall retained by the City as liquidated damages, as the sole and exclusive remedy available to the City, and neither Purchaser (or assignee or transferee) nor the City shall have any further rights against or liability to the other under this Agreement.

 Section 704. Reversion of Title to City Upon Failure to Commence Construction or Complete Improvements or Certain Other Events Subsequent to Conveyance to Purchaser

 The City is selling the Property for the purpose of the timely construction of Improvements as outlined in the Schematic Design and as revised in the MUP and Construction Documents, in reliance on the representation of Purchaser that such Improvements will be constructed. Therefore, as set forth in the Special Warranty Deed, the conveyance of the Property to Purchaser shall be subject to a condition subsequent to the effect that in the event of failure to commence construction of or to complete the Improvements in a timely manner, or failure to perform any obligation under Sections 301, 302, 303, 304, or upon the occurrence of other events described therein prior to completion of the Improvements, and after failure on the part of Purchaser to cure or remedy such failure or other event within the period (if any) and in the manner stated in the Special Warranty Deed, the City at its option may declare a termination of all the rights and interests in and to the Property conveyed by the Special Warranty Deed to Purchaser, and that such title and interests to and in the Property shall vest in the City, upon which all rights of Purchaser (and all persons claiming through Purchaser) in and to the Property and possession thereof shall cease;

 Provided, that such condition subsequent and any reverting of title as a result thereof in the City (1) shall always be subordinate to and limited by, and shall not defeat, render invalid, or limit in any way; (i) the lien of any mortgage authorized by the City pursuant to this Agreement, and (ii) any rights or interests provided in this Agreement for the protection of the holders of such mortgages; and (2) shall not apply to the Property once the Improvements to be constructed have been completed in accordance with this Agreement and the Certificate of Completion has been issued as provided in Section 315 hereof; and

 If the City exercises its right to revest title to the City pursuant to this Section, the City shall return to Purchaser, without interest, all funds paid by Purchaser to the City for the Property, after deducting (1) any amounts used to pay off liens incurred or permitted by Purchaser, and (2) City expenses related to this transaction, including expenses, if any, of restoring the Property to a safe and marketable condition; and (3) any amount by which the appraised value of the Property (or the portion thereof revested in the City) at the time of revesting in the City is exceeded by the price paid by Purchaser (or portion thereof allocable to the portion of the Property revested in the City, determined as stated below).

 C. In addition to, and not in the alternative to, the City's power of termination and possibility of reverter as provided for above, the City shall have the right, at any time when the City would have the right to declare a termination of Purchaser's interest under the terms of the Special Warranty Deed, by notice to Purchaser and Escrow Agent, to elect to retain the Completion Deposit without any deduction, offset or recoupment whatsoever, as liquidated damages in the event of default, violation or failure of the Purchaser as specified in this Section. If the City makes such election to collect the Completion Deposit, then Purchaser shall have an additional ninety (90) days beyond the deadline otherwise applicable to remedy the failure or event giving rise to the City's right to terminate Purchaser's interest, prior to effectiveness of any termination.

 Section 705. Other Rights and Remedies of City; No Waiver of Delay

 Either party shall have the right to institute such actions or proceedings as it may deem desirable for effectuating its remedies. Any delay by either party in instituting or prosecuting any such actions or proceedings or otherwise asserting its rights under this Agreement shall not operate as a waiver of any rights or remedies or to deprive it of or limit such rights or remedies in any way; nor shall any waiver in fact made with respect to any specific default be considered or treated as a waiver of the rights or remedies of either party with respect to any other defaults or with respect to the particular default except to the extent specifically waived in writing.
