 AN ORDINANCE concerning residential rental agreements, requiring that residential rental agreements for residential rental properties in the City of Seattle provide sixty (60) days prior written notice of any increase in housing charges that results in housing costs that are ten percent (10%) greater than that charged the same tenant for the same housing unit and services during the preceding twelve (12) months, and amending SMC 7.24.020, SMC 7.24.030, SMC 7.24.050., and SMC 7.24.060.

 WHEREAS, many renters in The City have sustained large increases in monthly housing charges recently, some as high as fifty percent (50%) in a one-month period; and

 WHEREAS, rental property owners often increase the monthly housing charges with only the minimum thirty (30) days prior written notice required by state law; and

 WHEREAS, state law requires a tenant who decides to vacate a unit to give the owner written notice twenty (20) days prior to the end of a monthly rental term; and

 WHEREAS, the state law requiring notice to vacate gives renters who received the minimum thirty (30) day notice of an increase in housing costs only ten days to make a life-changing decision; and

 WHEREAS, in that ten days a renter must decide whether they can afford to pay the increase in housing costs or whether they should risk trying to find more affordable housing in Seattle's tight rental housing market; and

 WHEREAS, a tenant who received the minimum thirty (30) day notice of a housing cost increase must, within the thirty (30) days, either find a way to pay the increased monthly housing cost for the current unit or locate and move to a new rental unit as well as find the money to pay the usual first and last months' rent and security deposit required upfront; and

 WHEREAS, the vacancy rate for rental housing in Seattle is currently 2.3%, making it extremely difficult to secure other rental housing at all; and,

 WHEREAS, a sixty (60) day notice of a proposed increase in housing costs will greatly aid renters by giving them forty (40) days, instead of the current ten (10), to make the decision whether to stay or try to move; and

 WHEREAS, a sixty (60) day notice of a proposed increase in housing costs will also greatly aid renters by giving them sixty (60) days to secure a means to pay the increased housing costs or to secure and pay for alternative rental housing; and,

 WHEREAS, a sixty (60) day notice of a proposed increase in housing costs will give renters greater stability and predictability in budgeting for housing costs. NOW THEREFORE,

 BE IT ORDAINED BY THE CITY OF SEATTLE AS FOLLOWS:
