 A. A vehicle may be impounded with or without citation and without giving prior notice to its owner as required in Section 11.30.060 hereof only under the following circumstances:

 1. When the vehicle is impeding or is likely to impede the normal flow of vehicular or pedestrian traffic; or

 2. When the vehicle is illegally occupying a truck, commercial load zone, restricted parking zone, bus, loading, hooded-meter, taxi, or other similar zone where, by order of the Director of Transportation or Chiefs of Police or Fire, parking is limited to designated classes of vehicles or is prohibited during certain hours, on designated days or at all times, and where such vehicle is interfering with the proper and intended use of such zones; or

 3. When a vehicle without a special license plate, card, or decal indicating that the vehicle is being used to transport a disabled person as defined under Chapter 46.16 RCW, as now or hereafter amended, is parked in a stall or space clearly and conspicuously marked as provided in Section 11.72.065 A, as now or hereafter amended, whether the space is provided on private property without charge or on public property; or

 4. When the vehicle poses an immediate danger to the public safety; or

 5. When a police officer has probable cause to believe that the vehicle is stolen; or

 6. When a police officer has probable cause to believe that the vehicle constitutes evidence of a crime or contains evidence of a crime, if impoundment is reasonably necessary in such instance to obtain or preserve such evidence; or

 7. When a vehicle is parked in a public right-of-way or on other publicly owned or controlled property in violation of any law, ordinance, or regulation and there are four (4) or more parking infractions issued against the vehicle for each of which a person has failed to respond, failed to appear at a requested hearing, or failed to pay an adjudicated parking infraction for at least forty-five (45) days from the date of the filing of the notice of infraction.

 B. Nothing in this section shall be construed to authorize seizure of a vehicle without a warrant where a warrant would otherwise be required.

 Section 2. This ordinance shall take effect and be in force thirty (30) days from and after its approval by the Mayor, but if not approved and returned by the Mayor within ten (10) days after presentation, it shall take effect as provided by Municipal Code Section 1.04.020.
