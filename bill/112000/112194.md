 AN ORDINANCE relating to the City Light Department, authorizing an easement agreement with Clarence A. Reuwsaat and Douglas Reuwsaat, each as his separate estate, for use of a portion of the Skagit Transmission Line Right of Way for ingress, egress and underground utilities (P.M. #320908-4-301).

 WHEREAS, by Warranty Deed dated April 30, 1927, and recorded under Snohomish County Auditor's File No. 452593, I.C. Major conveyed title to the south half of the northeast quarter of the southeast quarter of Section 8, Township 32 North, Range 9 East, W.M. to Eva M. Crill, et al.; and,

 WHEREAS, under said April 30, 1927 conveyance, I.C. Major neglected to reserve an easement over and across the land conveyed for the benefit of the north half of the northeast quarter of the southeast quarter of said Section 8, thereby leaving said north half landlocked, with no permanent legal access to a public road; and,

 WHEREAS, Clarence A. Reuwsaat and Douglas Reuwsaat are the current owners of portions of the landlocked north half of the northeast quarter of the southeast quarter of said Section 8; and,

 WHEREAS, the City is the current owner of a portion of the south half of the northeast quarter of the southeast quarter of said Section 8; and,

 WHEREAS, Messrs. Reuwsaat have requested that the City grant them easements across the City's property for ingress, egress and underground utilities in order to restore permanent legal access from their property to the County road, as required to meet Snohomish County conditions for development of their property; and,

 WHEREAS, the City Light Department has reviewed the easement request and has determined that, because an improved road already exists at the requested easement location, an easement for ingress, egress and underground utilities over and across the City's property will not present a hazard to or interfere with the construction, operation, maintenance, patrol and repair of the Skagit transmission system; and,

 WHEREAS, under common law, an implied easement arose at the time of the original conveyance from I.C. Major to Eva M. Crill, et al. as a necessary appurtenance to full enjoyment of the landlocked property, and the current owners of said property could obtain the requested easement through legal action;
