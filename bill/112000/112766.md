 AN ORDINANCE relating to Chapter 22, the Seattle Building Code, and extension of temporary permits issued under Section 106.10 with respect to the temporary structures at Mercer Street and Third Avenue North, and declaring an emergency requiring a 3/4 vote of the Seattle City Council so that the Ordinance may take effect immediately.

 NOW THEREFORE,

 BE IT ORDAINED BY THE CITY OF SEATTLE AS FOLLOWS:

 Section 1. The City Council hereby makes the following legislative findings of fact and declarations:

 1. The City of Seattle regulates the construction and occupancy of structures to protect life or limb, health, property, and public welfare through the Seattle Building Code, Seattle Municipal Code Chapter 22.

 2. The model Uniform Building Code, Section 3103, allows temporary structures to be erected under a special permit for "a limited period of time" and subject to appropriate conditions, as determined by the Building Official, without requiring compliance with the standards for a permanent structure. City of Seattle, in Section 106.10 of the Seattle Building Code, has modified this provision to allow temporary structures to be erected for no longer than six (6) months, regardless of type of construction or scope of use.

 3. During some periods of time the risk created by noncompliance with certain provisions of the Building Code may be small, depending on the code sections at issue, the type of construction and the use of the structure. As a result, the risk created by extending a temporary permit beyond six months in such circumstances can be lessened , provided appropriate conditions are imposed.

 4. A study of the circumstances in which temporary development permits may be issued for longer than six months and any resulting legislation is in process, but would not be effective for several months.

 5. The structures on Lots 1-4, Block 24 Mercer's 2nd addition to No. Seattle as recorded in Volume 2 of Plats at Page 7, records of King County, Washington, (the "Property") are temporary structures for which the City of Seattle issued a temporary building permit. Due to the type of construction used, their continued occupancy beyond six months may create an increased risk, which can be lessened if appropriate conditions are imposed. The public benefits from application of the energy conservation requirements of the code for permanent construction will not be achieved due to the temporary nature of the use.

 6. An emergency exists because the conditions needed to protect the public during the extension period should be implemented immediately or the structures should be closed.

 Section 2. The Department of Design, Construction and Land Use (DCLU) is authorized to extend the temporary development permit for the structures currently located on the Property for a period up to January 31, 2000, with the following conditions:

 A. The facility shall not be in operation when:

 1. Wind speeds are forecast to be or are greater than 50 miles per hour; or

 2. Snow is falling or has previously fallen and has collected on the roof.

 B. An independent, professional fire watch service shall be provided during all public and private gatherings that include consumption of alcoholic beverages.

 C. In addition, prior to extension of the permit, DCLU shall conduct an inspection to verify conformance with all the conditions of the original permit. If the Building Official determines that additional life safety risks from noncompliance with Seattle Building Code can be appropriately addressed through imposing conditions, additional conditions may be imposed.

 Section 3. The Department of Design, Construction and Land Use shall prepare a study and report to Council no later than the end of the first quarter of 2000 on the circumstances, if any, under which the six month period for temporary building permits might be extended as an amendment to the Seattle Building Code.

 Section 4. By reason of the findings set out in Section 1 an emergency is hereby declared to exist, this ordinance shall become effective immediately upon its approval by the Mayor or passage over his veto, as provided by the Charter of the City.

 PASSED by a three-fourths vote of all the members of the City Council the ______ day of ______________, 1999, and signed by me in open session in authentication of its passage this ______ day of ______________, 1999.
