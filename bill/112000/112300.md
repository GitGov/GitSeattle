 AN ORDINANCE relating to the development of multi-family housing; creating a new Chapter 5.72 of the Seattle Municipal Code in Title 5 - Taxation and Revenue, Subtitle II - Taxes, implementing RCW Chapter 84.14 to provide for exemption from ad valorem property taxation for qualifying multi-family housing in designated residential target areas within the City and designating certain areas as residential targeted areas; and amending Seattle Municipal Code Section 3.02.125 relating to Hearing Examiner fees.

 WHEREAS, Washington state law, RCW Chapter 84.14, adopted by the legislature in 1995, provides for the exemption from ad valorem property taxation for the value of eligible improvements associated with qualifying multi-unit housing located in residential target areas and authorizes the City to adopt necessary procedures to implement the State law; and

 WHEREAS, the stated purpose of RCW Chapter 84.14 is to increase residential opportunities by stimulating the construction of new multi-family housing and the rehabilitation of existing vacant and underutilized buildings for multi-family housing in areas where the City finds there are insufficient residential opportunities; and

 WHEREAS, the City Council finds that those areas within the City designated as urban center villages, hub urban villages or residential urban villages in the Land Use Element of the City's Comprehensive Plan satisfy the requirements of an "urban center" as defined under RCW 84.14.010(1); and

 WHEREAS, the Comprehensive Plan anticipates certain levels of new housing production within designated urban village neighborhoods, and certain neighborhoods have experienced minimal housing development, particularly relative to the Comprehensive Plan growth estimates; and

 WHEREAS, the City finds that the areas designated as residential targeted areas in this Ordinance are each located within an urban village as defined in this ordinance, that each area lacks sufficient available, desirable and convenient residential housing to meet the needs of the public who would be likely to live in such area if desirable, attractive and livable residences were available; and that the property tax exemption program implemented by this Ordinance will encourage increased residential opportunities within the City and stimulate the construction of new multifamily housing and the rehabilitation of existing vacant and underutilized buildings for multifamily housing; and

 WHEREAS, certain areas within the City lack sufficient housing opportunities to meet the needs of low and moderate income households who would be likely to live in such areas if affordable residences were available, and

 WHEREAS, it is the City's intent to preserve and protect buildings, objects, sites, and neighborhoods with historic, cultural, architectural, engineering or geographic significance located within the City, as provided in those chapters of the Seattle Municipal Code relating to landmarks preservation, landmark districts, historical districts and special review districts; and the property tax exemption program established by this ordinance shall support and further the goals and purposes expressed in those provisions of the Code; and

 WHEREAS, it is the City's goal to preserve, when appropriate, existing multifamily low-income housing in neighborhoods where such housing now exists, and to use the property tax exemption program to support and not hinder this goal;

 NOW, THEREFORE; BE IT ORDAINED BY THE CITY OF SEATTLE AS FOLLOWS:

 Section 1: A new chapter, Chapter 5.72, to be titled "Multifamily Housing Property Tax Exemption Ordinance" is hereby added to the Seattle Municipal Code, Title 5, Subtitle II, Taxes, as follows:

 Section 5.72.010 Purpose

 A. The purposes of this chapter are:

 1. To encourage more multifamily housing opportunities within the City;

 2. To stimulate the construction of new multifamily housing and the rehabilitation of existing vacant and underutilized buildings for multifamily housing;

 3. To increase the supply of multifamily housing opportunities within the City for low and moderate income households;

 4. To accomplish the planning goals required under the Growth Management Act, RCW chapter 36.70A, as implemented by the City's Comprehensive Plan;

 5. To promote community development, affordable housing, and neighborhood revitalization;

 6. To preserve and protect buildings, objects, sites, and neighborhoods with historic, cultural, architectural, engineering or geographic significance located within the City; and

 7. To encourage additional housing in areas that are consistent with planning for LINK Light Rail by Sound Transit.

 B. Any one or a combination of these purposes may be furthered by the designation of a residential targeted area under this chapter.

 Section 5.72.020 Definitions

 A. "Affordable" means: (1) for rental housing, that the units shall be rented to person(s) with household annual income, at the time of each tenant's initial occupancy, no greater than the percentage of median income designated in this chapter for the tenant's household size; and (2) for owner-occupied housing, that each owner of the property who occupies the unit after issuance of the final certificate of tax exemption under this chapter shall have a household annual income, at the time of each such owner's initial occupancy of the unit, no greater than the percentage of median income designated in this chapter for the owner's household size adjusted for the presumed family size of the unit as set forth above. A unit shall not cease to be affordable solely because the household annual income of the owner of owner-occupied housing, or tenant of rental housing, exceeds the annual income limit set forth in this subsection A after the date of initial occupancy.

 B. "Assessor" means the King County Assessor.

 C. "Director" means the Director of the City's Office of Housing, or any other City office, department or agency that shall succeed to its functions with respect to this chapter, or his or her authorized designee.

 D. "Household annual income" means the aggregate annual income of all persons over eighteen (18) years of age residing within the same household for a period of at least one month.

 E. "Median income" means annual median income for the metropolitan statistical area that includes Seattle, as most recently estimated by the United States Department of Housing and Urban Development, as adjusted for household size.

 F. "Multi-family housing" means a building or townhouse having four or more dwelling units designed for permanent residential occupancy resulting from new construction or rehabilitation or conversion of vacant, underutilized, or substandard buildings.

 G. "Owner" means the property owner of record.

 H. "Permanent residential occupancy" means multi-family housing that provides either rental or owner occupancy for a period of at least one month. This excludes hotels and motels that predominately offer rental accommodation on a daily or weekly basis.

 I. "Rehabilitation improvements" means (1) modifications to an existing structure the residential portion of which has been vacant for at least 12 months prior to application for exemption under this chapter, that are made to achieve a condition of substantial compliance with the applicable building and construction codes contained in SMC Title 22; or (2) modifications to an existing occupied residential structure or mixed use structure that contains occupied residential units, that add at least four multi-family housing units.

 J. "Residential targeted area" means an area within an urban village that has been so designated by the City Council pursuant to this chapter.

 K. "Substantial Compliance" means compliance with the applicable building and construction codes contained in SMC Title 22 that is typically required for rehabilitation as opposed to new construction.

 L. "Urban village" as used in this chapter means a neighborhood that: (1) is within an area designated as either an urban center village, a hub urban village or a residential urban village in the Land Use Element of the City's Comprehensive Plan; and (2) meets the definition of an "urban center" as defined in RCW Section 84.14.010.

 Section 5.72.030 Residential Targeted Areas -- Criteria -- Designation

 A. Following notice and public hearing as prescribed in RCW 84.14.040, the Council may designate one or more residential targeted areas, upon a finding by the Council in its sole discretion that the residential targeted area meets the following criteria:

 1. The residential targeted area is within an urban village;

 2. The residential targeted area lacks sufficient available, desirable and convenient residential housing to meet the needs of the public who would be likely to live in the urban village if desirable, attractive and livable residences were available; and

 3. Providing additional housing opportunity in the residential targeted area will assist in achieving one or more of the following purposes:

 (a) encourage increased residential opportunities within the City; or

 (b) stimulate the construction of new affordable multifamily housing; and

 (c) encourage the rehabilitation of existing vacant and underutilized buildings for multifamily housing.

 B. In designating a residential targeted area, the Council may also consider other factors, including:

 1. Whether additional housing in the residential targeted area will attract and maintain an increase in the number of permanent residents;

 2. Whether providing additional housing opportunities for low and moderate income households would meet the needs of citizens likely to live in the area if affordable residences were available;

 3. Whether an increased permanent residential population in the residential targeted area will help to achieve the planning goals mandated by the Growth Management Act under RCW 36.70A, as implemented through the City's Comprehensive Plan;

 4. Whether encouraging additional housing in the residential targeted area is consistent with plans for LINK Light Rail by Sound Transit; or

 5. Whether additional housing may contribute to revitalization of a distressed neighborhood or area within the City.

 C. At any time the Council may, by ordinance, in its sole discretion, amend or rescind the designation of a residential targeted area pursuant to the same procedural requirements as set forth in this chapter for original designation.

 D. The following areas, as shown in the attached Attachments 1 through 9, are designated as residential targeted areas under this chapter:

 A. The property must be located in a residential targeted area.

 B. The project must be multi-family housing consisting of at least four dwelling units within a residential structure or as part of a mixed use development in which at least fifty percent of the space within such residential structure or mixed use development is intended for permanent residential occupancy.

 C. For new construction, a minimum of four new dwelling units must be created; for rehabilitation or conversion of existing occupied structures, a minimum of four additional dwelling units must be added.

 D. For rehabilitation or conversion of an existing vacant building, the residential portion of the building shall have been vacant for at least twelve (12) months before application for a conditional exemption, and the rehabilitation improvements shall achieve a condition of substantial compliance with the applicable building and construction codes contained in SMC Title 22.

 E. For rehabilitation or conversion of existing occupied structures, there shall be no "displacement" of existing residential tenants, as such term is defined in Section 22.210.030(E) of the Seattle Municipal Code;

 F. For new construction projects where an existing rental housing structure that contained four or more occupied dwelling units was demolished on the site of the new project within 12 months prior to application for exemption under this chapter, the owner shall agree, on terms and conditions satisfactory to the Director, to replace any units within such structure that were rented to tenants who receive a tenant relocation assistance payment under SMC Ch. 22.210, subject to the following requirements:

 (1) For the first ten calendar years of operation of the replacement units, the replacement units shall be affordable at or below 50% of median income.

 (2) Replacement may be accomplished either as part of the new construction for which application for exemption is made under this chapter, or through the new construction of additional multiple-unit housing at another location, or through the substantial rehabilitation of vacant multiple-unit housing, or through the preservation of housing that is rented at the time of application to tenants with household annual income at or below 50% of median income, and that the Director determines would otherwise be converted to a use other than rental to tenants with such income.

 (3) The replacement housing shall be completed, and a temporary or permanent certificate of occupancy shall be issued, within three years from the date of approval of the application, provided that the Director may extend the time for completion if the Director finds that: (i) the failure to complete the replacement housing is due to circumstances beyond the owner's control; (ii) the owner has been acting and may reasonably be expected to continue to act in good faith and with due diligence; and (iii) the replacement housing will be completed within a reasonable time.

Such certificate of approval, permit or other approval shall satisfy the requirement under subsection J of this section that the applicant complete design review under SMC Chapter 23.41.

 M. The project must comply with all applicable zoning requirements, land use regulations, and building and housing code requirements contained in SMC Title 22 and Title 23 at the time of new construction, rehabilitation or conversion.

 N.

The owner shall verify the application by oath or affirmation. The application shall contain such information as the Director may deem necessary or useful, and shall include:

 1. A brief written description of the project and preliminary schematic site and floor plans of the multifamily units and the structure(s) in which they are proposed to be located;

 2. A statement from the owner acknowledging the potential tax liability when the property ceases to be eligible for exemption under this chapter; and

 C. The Director shall notify the applicant within twenty-eight (28) days of the application being filed if the Director determines that an application is not complete and shall identify what additional information is required before the application will be complete. Within twenty-eight (28) days of receiving additional information, the Director shall notify the applicant in writing if the Director determines that the application is still not complete, and what additional information is necessary. An application shall be deemed to be complete if the Director does not notify the applicant in writing by the deadlines in this section that the application is incomplete; however, a determination of completeness does not preclude the Director from requiring additional information during the review process if more information is needed to evaluate the application according to the criteria in this chapter.

 D. Except as otherwise provided in subsection E of this section, the application shall be submitted any time before the earlier of (i) an application for a master use permit or other land use permit under SMC Title 23, and (ii) an application for a building or other construction permit under SMC Title 22.

 E. If, on the effective date of this Chapter 5.72, the applicant has applied for a permit identified in subsection D of this section, then application for exemption under this section may be submitted any time prior to issuance of a building permit; provided that, for new construction, the applicant shall have completed, or be in the process of completing, design review or administrative design review as required under Section 5.72.040(K), or shall have obtained a certificate of approval, permit, or other approval as provided under Section 5.72.040(L).

 Section 5.72.060 Application Review -- Issuance of Conditional Certificate -- Denial -- Appeal

 A. The Director shall approve or deny an application under this chapter. If the application is approved, the applicant shall enter into a contract with the City, subject to approval by resolution of the City Council, regarding the terms and conditions of the project and eligibility for exemption under this chapter. The City Council's resolution to approve the applicant's contract with the City shall take place within 90 days of the Director's receipt of the completed application. Upon Council approval of the contract, the Director shall execute the contract as approved by the City Council, and the Director shall issue a conditional certificate of acceptance of tax exemption. The conditional certificate shall expire three (3) years from the date of approval unless an extension is granted as provided in this chapter.

 C. If the application is denied, the Director shall state in writing the reasons for the denial and send notice of denial to the applicant's last known address within ten days of the denial.

 D. An applicant may appeal the Director's denial of the application to the City Council within thirty (30) days of receipt of the denial. The appeal before the City Council will be based upon the record before the Director, and the Director's decision will be upheld unless the applicant can show that there is no substantial evidence on the record to support the Director's decision. The City Council's decision on appeal is final.

 Section 5.72.070 Extension of Conditional Certificate

 The Conditional Certificate may be extended by the Director for a period not to exceed 24 consecutive months. The applicant shall submit a written request stating the grounds for the extension together with a fee of $150.00 for the City's administrative cost to process the request. The Director may grant an extension if the Director determines that:

 A. The anticipated failure to complete construction or rehabilitation within the required time period is due to circumstances beyond the control of the owner; and

 B. The owner has been acting and could reasonably be expected to continue to act in good faith and with due diligence; and

 C. All the conditions of the original contract between the applicant and the City will be satisfied upon completion of the project.

 Section 5.72.080 Final Certificate -- Application -- Issuance -- Denial and Appeal

 A. Upon completion of the rehabilitation improvements or new construction as provided in the contract between the applicant and the City, and upon issuance of a temporary certificate of occupancy, or a permanent certificate of occupancy if no temporary certificate is issued, the applicant may request a Final Certificate of Tax Exemption. The applicant shall file with the Director such information as the Director may deem necessary or useful to evaluate eligibility for the Final Certificate, and shall include:

 1. A statement of expenditures made with respect to each multi- family housing unit and the total expenditures made with respect to the entire property;

 2. A description of the completed work and a statement of qualification for the exemption;

 3. A statement that the work was completed within the required three-year period or any approved extension; and

If the Director approves the application, the City will forward the fee for the Assessor's administrative costs to the Assessor. If the Director denies the application, the City will refund the fee for the Assessor's administrative costs to the applicant.

 C. Within 30 days of receipt of all materials required for a Final Certificate, the Director shall determine whether the completed work is consistent with the contract between the City and owner and is qualified for exemption under this chapter, and which specific improvements satisfy the requirements of this chapter.

 D. If the Director determines that the project has been completed in accordance with the contract between the applicant and the City and the requirements of this chapter, the City shall file a Final Certificate of Tax Exemption with the Assessor within 10 days of the expiration of the thirty-day period provided under subsection C of this section.

 E. The Director is authorized to cause to be recorded, or to require the applicant or owner to record, in the real property records of the King County Department of Records and Elections, the contract with the City required under subsection 5.72.060(A) of this chapter, or such other document(s) as will identify such terms and conditions of eligibility for exemption under this chapter as the Director deems appropriate for recording, including requirements under this chapter relating to affordability of units.

 F. The Director shall notify the applicant in writing that the City will not file a Final Certificate if the Director determines that the project was not completed within the required three-year period or any approved extension, or was not completed in accordance with the contract between the applicant and the City and the requirements of this chapter.

 G. The applicant may file an appeal of the Director's decision that a Final Certificate will not be issued to the King County Superior Court within thirty (30) days of receiving notice of that decision.

 Section 5.72.090 Exemption -- Duration -- Limits

 A. The value of new housing construction and rehabilitation improvements qualifying under this chapter will be exempt from ad valorem property taxation for ten (10) successive years as provided in RCW 84.14.020(1).

 B. The exemption does not apply to the value of land or to the value of improvements not qualifying under this chapter, nor does the exemption apply to increases in assessed valuation of land and non- qualifying improvements, or to increases made by lawful order of the King County Board of Equalization, the Washington State Department of Revenue, State Board of Tax Appeals, or King County, to a class of property throughout the county or a specific area of the county to achieve uniformity of assessment or appraisal as required by law. In the case of rehabilitation of existing buildings, the exemption does not include the value of improvements constructed prior to submission of the completed application required under this chapter.

 A. Within 30 days after the first anniversary of the date the City filed the Final Certificate of Tax Exemption and each year thereafter, for a period of 10 years, the property owner shall file a certification with the Director, verified upon oath or affirmation, which shall contain such information as the Director may deem necessary or useful, and shall include the following information:

 1. A statement of occupancy and vacancy of the multi-family units during the previous year;

 2. A certification that the property has not changed use since the date of filing of the Final Certificate of Tax Exemption, and continues to be in compliance with the contract with the City and the requirements of this chapter;

 3. A description of any improvements or changes to the property made after the filing of the Final Certificate or last declaration, as applicable; and

 4. Information demonstrating the owner's compliance with the affordability requirements of Subsections 5.72.040(G) and (H).

 B. Failure to submit the annual declaration may result in cancellation of the tax exemption.

 Section 5.72.110 Cancellation of Tax Exemption -- Appeal

 A. If at any time the Director determines that the property no longer complies with the terms of the contract or with the requirements of this chapter, or for any reason no longer qualifies for the tax exemption, the tax exemption shall be canceled and additional taxes, interest and penalty imposed pursuant to State law.

 B. If the owner intends to convert the multi-family housing to another use, the owner must notify the Director and the King County Assessor within 60 days of the change in use. Upon such change in use, the tax exemption shall be canceled and additional taxes, interest and penalty imposed pursuant to State law.

 C. Upon determining that a tax exemption shall be canceled, the Director, on behalf of the City Council, shall notify the property owner by certified mail, return receipt requested. The property owner may appeal the determination by filing a notice of appeal with the City Clerk within 30 days, specifying the factual and legal basis for the appeal. The Hearing Examiner will conduct a hearing pursuant to SMC 3.02.090 at which all affected parties may be heard and all competent evidence received. The Hearing Examiner will affirm, modify, or repeal the decision to cancel the exemption based on the evidence received. The Hearing Examiner shall give substantial weight to the Director's decision and the burden of overcoming that weight shall be upon the appellant.

These reports may include recommendations on whether any neighborhoods should be added or removed, whether affordability limits should be changed in certain areas, and will analyze any issues related to the use of the program for homeownership units. In 2002, the committee shall review and report to the City Council regarding the effectiveness of the program during its first three years of operation. Such review shall include costs and benefits of the program, an assessment of the affordability limits, and may include recommended program modifications.
