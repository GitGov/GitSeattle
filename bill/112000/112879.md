 EXCEPT THE FOLLOWING DESCRIBED PARCEL:

 That portion of the northeast quarter (NE44) of the southwest quarter (SW44), the southwest quarter (SW44) of the northwest quarter (NW44) and Government Lot 2 in Section 2, TWP 25N, RNG 04E, as acquired by the U. S. Navy on behalf of the United States of America by deed recorded in the records of King Co., Washington in Vol. 1306 at pg. 455, described as follows:

 Commencing at the southwest corner of said Lot 2, accepted as being the same as the intersection of the centerline of Sand Point Way NE with the production east of the north margin of NE 75th Street, thence S 00 48' 49" E on said centerline a distance of 212.12 feet, thence N 89 11' 11" E a distance of 40.00 feet to the east margin of Sand Point Way NE, thence S 00 48' 49" E on said east margin a distance of 55.12 feet, thence N8942'47"E a distance of 423.52 feet, thence N0 01'33"W a distance of 945.00 feet to the True Point of Beginning, thence continuing N0 01'33"W a distance of 455.06 feet, thence S89 54'15"Wa distance of 382.55 feet, thence S 78 17' 54" W a distance of 116.65 feet to a point of curvature the radial center of which bears S 11 42' 06" E at a distance of 118.61 feet, thence on said curve concave to the southeast through a central angle of 39 41'40" an arc distance of 82.17 feet to a non-tangent cusp, thence leaving said curve S 28 13' 40" E, a distance of 411.42 feet to a point of curvature the radial center of which bears N 61 46' 20" E at a distance of 50.00 feet, thence on said curve concave to the northeast through a central angle of 61 48'42" an arc distance of 53.94 feet, thence N8957'38"Ea distance of 326.93 feet to the True Point of Beginning.

 Section 2. Streets and roads as laid off in Section 1 hereof are hereby placed under the jurisdiction of Seattle Transportation Department except for that portion of NE 74th Street lying easterly of the production southerly of the east margin of 63rd Avenue NE, which shall remain under the jurisdiction of the Superintendent of Parks and Recreation as a park road.

 Section 3. Any act consistent with the authority and prior to the effective date of this ordinance is hereby ratified and confirmed.

 Section 4. The streets laid off by this ordinance provide necessary access to a portion of the City's property at Sand Point that has been leased to Sand Point Community Housing Association ("SPCHA") to provide housing for the homeless. In order to complete the financing of rehabilitation of buildings on that leased property, SPCHA, as general partner of Sand Point Housing Associates I Limited Partnership ("Partnership"), must obtain a bank letter of credit to securefor the $3,520,000 Community Development Block Grant ("CDBG") Float Loan previously approved by the City Council. The bank requires a deed of trust on SPCHA's and Partnership's interests in these buildings and a title insurance endorsement insuring access. SPCHA and City staff previously believed that the bank's requirements could be satisfied by an informal assurance of access from the Department of Parks and Recreation; however, the City has now been informed that such assurance is not sufficient. Until the ordinance is effective, the letter of credit cannot be secured and, consistent with the conditions of the CDBG Float Loan as approved by City Council pursuant to federal regulations, the City cannot disburse loan proceeds to the Partnership. This could result in the inability of the Partnership to pay contractors' invoices that are due by September 15, 1999, which could put the Partnership in default on construction contracts and impair its ability to complete renovations in order to make decent, affordable housing units available to the homeless. Failure to complete this low- income housing development would exacerbate the shortage of housing for the homeless and would result in more individuals and families without shelter in Seattle. Therefore, the City Council finds and declares that an emergency exists in which it is necessary for the immediate preservation of public health and safety that this ordinance become effective without delay. By reason of the facts stated above and the emergency that

 has been declared to exist, this ordinance shall take effect immediately upon approval of the same by the Mayor.
