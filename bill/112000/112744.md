 WHEREAS, members of the Broadview/Haller Lake Organizing Committee focused during 1997 and early 1998 on the surface water drainage and sewage systems including both urgent short-term problems and long- range policy and system development which culminated in a special workshop in May 1998 with Seattle Public Utilities staff; and

 WHEREAS, the Vision 2020: Broadview-Bitter Lake-Haller Lake Neighborhood Planning Committee was funded in May 1998 by the Neighborhood Planning Office for phase II; and

 WHEREAS the committee selected consultants and established sub- committees focused on transportation and land use, and a steering committee to study issues and generate proposals for monthly planning committee review, and recommendations were formed on the community's priorities and responses to the City's proposal for a hub urban village; and
