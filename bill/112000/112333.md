 AN ORDINANCE relating to Seattle Center and real property at Mercer Street and 3rd Avenue No.; authorizing execution of a Lease of the property from the Kreielsheimer Foundation and Sublease of the same property to One Reel, a nonprofit organization; and declaring an emergency.

 WHEREAS, the Master Plan for the Seattle Center identifies the need for redevelopment along the Mercer Street corridor to enhance the existing performing arts activities, pedestrian access, and connections with the surrounding neighborhoods, and Seattle Center is acquiring property on the north side of Mercer Street to as part of this redevelopment; and

 WHEREAS, One Reel, a Washington nonprofit organization, has contracted to present a dinner cabaret/circus event unique to this area using a European Speigeltent and performers from around the world, which is an event that is complementary to Seattle Center's mission to provide world class entertainment; and

 WHEREAS, the Kreielsheimer Foundation owns undeveloped property that has been partially excavated and fenced and has become an eyesore, on the north side of Mercer Street at 3rd Avenue No., adjacent to the Seattle Center and abutting property the Seattle Center is acquiring pursuant to its Master Plan for redevelopment (the "Property"); and

 WHEREAS, locating the One Reel event on the Property will promote the redevelopment goals of the Seattle Center on a permanent basis by filling the excavation and ameliorating the eyesore, and on a temporary basis by providing landscaping and pedestrian lighting along property abutting the Center, as well as by bringing to the area activities that draw attention to the performing arts activities in the Seattle Center Theater District along Mercer Street; and

 WHEREAS, the Kreielsheimer Foundation wishes to put the property to a temporary use that furthers the Foundation's purpose of supporting the arts, but is unfamiliar with the logistics of the entertainment industry and so is willing to lease the property at no cost to Seattle Center; and

 WHEREAS the Seattle Center has experience in leasing property for performing arts purposes and intends to sublease the property to One Reel; NOW, THEREFORE,

 BE IT ORDAINED BY THE CITY OF SEATTLE AS FOLLOWS:

 Section As requested by the Seattle Center Director and recommended by the Mayor, the Seattle Center Director is authorized to execute for and on behalf of The City of Seattle, a lease agreement with the Kreielsheimer Foundation substantially in the form of the agreement attached hereto and identified as "LEASE AGREEMENT BETWEEN THE KREIELSHEIMER FOUNDATION AND THE CITY OF SEATTLE, with such changes to the insurance provisions as may be approved pursuant to the risk management procedures set out in the Memorandum issued by the Mayor dated May 23,1995, as updated from time to time.

 Section As requested by the Seattle Center Director and recommended by the Mayor, the Seattle Center Director is authorized to execute for and on behalf of The City of Seattle, a lease agreement with One Reel substantially in the form of the agreement attached hereto and identified as "SUBLEASE AGREEMENT BETWEEN THE CITY OF SEATTLE AND ONE REEL, with such changes to the insurance provisions as may be approved pursuant to the risk management procedures set out in the Memorandum issued by the Mayor dated May 23,1995, as updated from time to time.

 Section 3. The Council finds that the leases entered into under this ordinance must be effective immediately for the following reasons. As set out in the letter accompanying this legislation, an integral part of One Reel's production is the use of a European "Speigeltent" which must be erected under the direction of a Belgian expert who will be in Seattle September 14-17, after which he returns to Europe and will not be available for two years. If these leases are not approved immediately, the site preparation and erection of the tent cannot occur by September 14 -17, and the project must be canceled. One Reel planned the production over the past two years for a different site, and was compelled to seek this new location only very recently when a conflict with environmental laws was discovered at the original site. Cancellation of the project means the loss of the permanent benefits to the Seattle Center from eliminating the current undesirable conditions on the Property, as well as loss of the temporary benefits from the improvement of pedestrian, landscaping and other conditions that advance the goals of Seattle Center's Master Plan for redeveloping and strengthening the Theater District. The Council finds that an emergency exists necessitating approval of these leases, and therefore this ordinance shall become effective immediately upon the approval of the same by the Mayor or passage over his veto, as provided by the Charter of the City.

 PASSED by three-quarters vote of all the members of the City Council the _____ day of ________________, 1998, and signed by me in open session in authentication of its passage this ____ day of _________________, 1998.
