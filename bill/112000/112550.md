 AN ORDINANCE relating to the Seattle City Employees' Retirement System; changing the payment schedule of the annual bonus dividend for current retirees; and amending Chapter 4.36 of the Seattle Municipal Code.

 BE IT ORDAINED BY THE CITY OF SEATTLE AS FOLLOWS:

 Section Dividend to be paid in monthly installments. Section 4.36.155 of the Seattle Municipal Code is amended as follows:

 4.36.155 Annual bonus dividend for current and future retirees.

Each January, the Board of Administration shall declare a supplemental monthly dividend payable to all members and beneficiaries who will receive a current benefit during that year as described in subsection I. Each December, the Board of Administration shall declare and pay to all retired members and beneficiaries receiving a current benefit the base annual bonus dividend described in subsections A through H, inclusive, plus the supplemental dividend adjustment described in subsection I, if applicable. Such ~~bonus~~dividends will be calculated and paid in accordance with the following formula:

 A. One percent (1%) of the current benefit, payable on behalf of members who retired in the current and immediately preceding year;

 B. Three percent (3%) of the current benefit, payable on behalf of members who have been retired from two (2) to five (5) years, inclusive;

 C. Six percent (6%) of the current benefit, payable on behalf of members who have been retired from six (6) to nine (9) years, inclusive;

 D. Nine percent (9%) of the current benefit, payable on behalf of members who have been retired from ten (10) to thirteen (13) years, inclusive;

 E. Twelve percent (12%) of the current benefit, payable on behalf of members who have been retired from fourteen (14) to eighteen (18) years, inclusive;

 F. Fifteen percent (15%) of the current benefit, payable on behalf of members who have been retired from nineteen (19) to twenty-three (23) years, inclusive;

 G. Eighteen percent (18%) of the current benefit, payable on behalf of members who have been retired from twenty-four (24) to twenty-eight (28) years, inclusive;

 H. Twenty-one percent (21%) of the current benefit, payable on behalf of members who have been retired for twenty-nine (29) or more years.

 I. This subsection applies to members, or~~For~~ beneficiaries receiving payments on behalf of any such member, who retired before January 1, 1998.~~,~~~~i~~I f the sum of that beneficiary's current benefit plus the base annual bonus dividend as established in subsections A through H above is less than sixty percent (60%) of the beneficiary's indexed benefit, then the beneficiary's total annual bonus dividend shall be ~~increased to~~ equal to the difference between the current benefit and sixty percent (60%) of the beneficiary's indexed benefit. However, in no year may the amount of the total annual bonus dividend be less than the amount of the total annual bonus dividend paid in the previous calendar year. The total annual bonus dividend is paid as the base annual bonus dividend plus supplemental monthly dividends and a supplemental dividend adjustment to the base annual bonus dividend. Each year in January the Retirement Board shall compute the supplemental monthly dividend based upon the total supplemental dividends paid during the previous calendar year divided by 12. In December of each year, a supplemental dividend adjustment shall be computed equal to the difference between the sum of the supplemental monthly dividends paid in January through November of that calendar year and the total supplemental dividend payable for that calendar year.

 Section Section 4.36.215 of the Seattle Municipal Code is amended as follows:
