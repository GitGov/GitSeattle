 "6.2 Public Access Facility Location and Funding

 "(A) The Grantee shall maintain, operate, and provide existing Public Access facilities and levels of service provided as of December 1, 1995 pursuant to its prior City franchise obligations. Replacement equipment and additional Public Access facilities and services shall be provided pursuant to Section 6.2(B) as determined by the City in consultation with the Grantee, the Designated Access Manager for Public Access, and other area franchising authorities. Grantee shall be responsible for maintenance of replacement equipment.

 "(B) Funding for Public Access facilities and services other than existing facilities and levels of service described in Subsection (A) above shall be provided by the City from its franchise fees and general funds, with contributions from other area franchising authorities as appropriate under their respective franchises and permitted by applicable law. Funding shall not be financed by additional charges to City resident Subscribers except as provided in Section 11.5. Nothing in this section shall prevent the Designated Access Manager for Public Access from engaging in general public fundraising activities to provide additional support for public access.

 "... ;" and

 WHEREAS, Ordinance 118196 established a Cable Television Franchise Sub-Fund in the General Fund, into which subfund revenues from the Cable Franchise Fee are to be deposited; and

 WHEREAS, Ordinance 118196 also called for a review of the current equipment utilized for public access production, including preparation of specific recommendations for equipment replacement; and

 WHEREAS, the City and King County jointly engaged the River Oaks Communications Corporation to undertake a comprehensive study of this area's public access television resource, which study included an assessment of equipment and recommendations for equipment replacement; and

 WHEREAS, the City has already appropriated a portion of the funding needed for new public access equipment; and

 WHEREAS, it is anticipated that future cable franchise fee revenues will be sufficient to cover the full cost of the equipment that will be purchased through the appropriation made by this ordinance; Now, Therefore,

 Section 1. In order to implement the provisions of the franchise agreement with TCI of Seattle, Inc. ("TCI"), the Executive Services Department is authorized to purchase public access video equipment, or to reimburse TCI for TCI's purchase, for and on behalf of the City, of such equipment; provided, that if TCI is requested to purchase such equipment for and on the City's behalf, such purchasing activity shall be exempt from the provisions of Subchapter VIII of Chapter 3.18 of the Seattle Municipal Code.

 Section 2. To pay for the acquisition of public access video equipment and other costs associated with the purchase contemplated in Section 1 hereof, the expenditure allowance in the 1998 Budget of the Executive Services Department, Technology Division (SFMS Code A44) is increased by the amount of Five Hundred Fifty Thousand Dollars ($550,000.00), by the appropriation, hereby made and authorized, of the sum of Five Hundred Fifty Thousand Dollars ($550,000.00) from the Executive Services Fund.
