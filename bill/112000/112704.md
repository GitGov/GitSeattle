 Section 2. Programs. Special Assessment revenues shall be used for the following component programs.

 A. Public Safety.

 The public safety program will identify, report, and act as problem-solvers on public safety issues, in coordination with the Police Department, mental health and substance abuse programs, and human service agencies.

 B. Maintenance. The maintenance program will provide sidewalk sweeping and graffiti removal, special projects to clean up problem areas, monitoring and problem solving for alley maintenance and trash removal problems, and possible routine maintenance of automated public restrooms.

 C. Marketing and Public Relations.

 The marketing and public relations program will promote a positive image of the assessment area. The program will also track shifts in Downtown's economy, research new opportunities and provide information on impacts of economic changes.

 D. Reserve Fund

 This budget plan shows proposed expenditures based upon assessments collected from ratepayers.

 Section 3. Levy of Special Assessments. To finance the programs authorized in Section 2, there is levied upon and shall be collected from the businesses, multifamily residential properties (buildings containing more than four residential units), and mixed-use properties (buildings with both multi-family residential and commercial units) (collectively, "Ratepayers") in the Downtown Business Improvement Area described in Section 1, a Five-Year special assessment in an amount not to exceed Fourteen Million, Eight Hundred Seventy Five Thousand, Six Hundred Sixty- Eight Dollars ($14,875,668.00), which amount shall be collected semiannually. The total Assessment is measured by the type of use and rate of assessment in the following table, subject to the calculations and limitations in this Section:

 Five-Year Assessment = (Land Square Footage x $1.5379) + (Total 1997 Assessed Value of Site (Property + Improvements)/$1,000 x $1.5927). Records for the assessment calculation and the Ratepayer are based on information provided by the King County Assessor's office for the year 1997, its database, and by on-site surveys. Modifications or limitations to these assessments are described below. No five-year assessment for any individual parcel shall exceed a total amount equal to 9.2909 x (Total Assessed Value/$1,000). This rate is called the "Benefit Ceiling Rate". For the following special classifications of Ratepayers a Special Benefit Ceiling Rate shall be applied as set forth below to determine the rate most reflective of benefit for that particular class of Ratepayer:

 1. Commercial Mixed-Use $ 9.29/$ 1,000 of total assessed value

 2. Surface Parking $ 5.31/$ 1,000 of total assessed value

 3. Multi-Family Residential $ 3.45/$ 1,000 of total assessed value or

 Apartments: the lesser of: $ 345.09 per unit

 4. Multi-Family Residential $ 1.43/$ 1,000 of total assessed value or Condominiums: the lesser of: $ 345.09 per unit

 5. Industrial Warehouse $ 1.8581/$ 1,000 of total assessed value

 6. Multi-Family Residential Apartments $ .93/$ 1,000 of total assessed value or possessing a rent restriction covenant: the lesser of $ 39.82 per unit

 7. Hotel: the lesser of: $ 7.95/$ 1,000 of total assessed value or $ 292.00 a room

 8. Non Residential (Owned by a Non-Profit) $ 1.86/$ 1,000 of total assessed value

 9. Piers $ .32 per square foot of pier area.

 Ratepayers shall pay the lesser of the Benefit Ceiling Rate or the Special Benefit Ceiling Rate, as the case may be, with the exception of piers, which shall pay the Special Benefit Ceiling Rate. Property owned by governmental entities or public utilities, and land that is vacant, shall not be assessed. All businesses, multifamily residential or multi-use projects within the area shall be subject to the provisions of this special assessment as authorized by RCW 35.87A.010.

 Section 4. Rate Changes. Changes in the assessment rate shall only be made by ordinance and as authorized in RCW 35.87A.140.

 (b) All income to the City from public events financed with special assessments;

 (c) Gifts and donations for the Account;

 (d) Interest and all other income from the investment of Account deposits;

 (e) Restitution moneys for expenditures made from the Account and reimbursements due to the Account.

 Section 6. Collection Schedule. Special assessments shall be collected on a semi-annual basis. The Director, Executive Services Department, or the Director's designee ("Director") may change the billing frequency by directive. A copy of the directive shall be mailed to all Ratepayers not less than 90 days before the new billing cycle is to take effect.

 Section 7. Delinquent Payments. If an assessment has not been paid within thirty (30) days after its due date, the Director shall send a reminder notice and add a Five Dollar ($5.00) processing fee. If the assessment is not paid within sixty (60) days after its due date, a delinquency charge shall be added in the amount of ten percent (10%) of the assessment in addition to an additional Five Dollar ($5.00) processing fee. All assessments that are not paid within sixty (60) days of the due date shall also bear interest from the due date at twelve percent (12%) per annum. The Director is authorized to bring an action to collect any unpaid assessments in any court of competent jurisdiction in King County.

 Section 8. Notices. Notices of assessment, installment payments, or delinquency, and all other notices contemplated by this ordinance may be sent by ordinary mail or delivered by the City to the address shown on the records of the Director, and, if no address is shown there, to the address shown on the records of the County Assessor. Failure of the Ratepayer to receive any mailed notice shall not release the Ratepayer from the duty to pay the assessment and any interest and delinquency charges on the due date.

 Section 9. Disputes. Any Ratepayer aggrieved by the amount of an assessment or delinquency charge may on request obtain a meeting with the Director or the Director's designee. If not satisfied, the Ratepayer may appeal the matter to the City's Hearing Examiner in the manner provided for a contested case under Chapter 3.02 of the Seattle Municipal Code. The Ratepayer has the burden of proof to show that the assessment or delinquency fee is incorrect.

 Section 11. Ratepayers Advisory Board. The Director shall appoint an interim Ratepayers Advisory Board comprised of Ratepayers from the Area within thirty days of the effective date of this ordinance.

The interim Ratepayers Advisory Board will recommend a permanent Ratepayers Advisory Board (the "Board") within ninety days of the effective date of this ordinance. The composition of the Board shall be representative of both the entire geographic area of the District and representative of the special classifications in Section 2.

 The Director may appoint additional members to the Ratepayers Advisory Board to ensure that a broad representation of Ratepayers is provided. The additional members so appointed shall not exceed one-third (1/3) of the entire membership of the Board.

 The Ratepayers Advisory Board shall be responsible for adopting bylaws and policy guidelines, providing advice and consultation to the Department initially, and to any individual or agency hired to manage the day-to-day operations of the Business Improvement Area program, on all matters related to the operation of the program.

 The Ratepayers Advisory Board shall: meet at least once quarterly; recommend an annual work program and budget; address and discuss Ratepayer concerns and questions regarding the DBIA district and program; review all reports submitted to the Department by the program manager; and sponsor an annual Ratepayers' meeting.

 At the annual Ratepayers' meeting, the Board shall submit for approval its proposed work plan and budget for the next year, and its recommendation regarding whether to continue with the current program manger. The work plan, budget, and recommendation regarding whether to continue with the current program manager must be approved by a majority vote of the Ratepayers attending the meeting.

 (a) Classify Ratepayers within the types of use under Section 3 and resolve ambiguities in the application of rates;

 (b) Collect the special assessments; refund special assessments when overpaid or otherwise improperly collected; extend the deadline for payment and waive delinquency charges and interest whenever the delinquency results from extenuating circumstances beyond the Ratepayer's control, such as a casualty loss causing premature closure of the business or bankruptcy or the total payment due to the City (exclusive of penalty and interest) is Ten Dollars ($10.00) or less; and exempt homes for which the King County Assessor has granted an exemption from property taxes under RCW 84.36.381 - .389 on account of the low income status of the owner - resident.

 Section 13. Contract for Program Management.

It is the intent of the City Council that the Director contract with the Downtown Seattle Association to administer the program during the initial year, and for each year thereafter for as long as the Ratepayers concur in its continuation as the Program Manager. The selection of a Program Manager upon the recommendation of the Ratepayers shall obviate compliance with the consultant selection procedures of Seattle Municipal Code Chapter 3.114 and Section 20.46A.170. The Seattle Police Department shall review any proposed contract for private security.

 Section 14. Commencement of Assessments. Assessments shall commence as of the effective date of this ordinance.
