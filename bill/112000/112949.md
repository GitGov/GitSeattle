 AN ORDINANCE relating to the Cumulative Reserve Subfund; creating an account within that subfund to hold reserves for revenue stabilization for future operations and establishing standards for the accumulation of those reserves; transferring funds within the accounts of the Cumulative Reserve Subfund and eliminating the Major Maintenance Reserve Account; and amending Sections 5.06.030, 5.80.020, and 5.80.030 of the Seattle Municipal Code in connection therewith.

 WHEREAS, RCW 35.21.070 and Seattle Municipal Code 5.80.010 include among the permissible uses of the Cumulative Reserve Subfund the provision of reserves for revenue stabilization for future operations; and

 WHEREAS, the City's revenue sources are susceptible to sudden unanticipated shortfalls due to: (1) economic downturns, (2) changes in State law governing City revenue, or (3) legal judgements; and

 WHEREAS, sudden downward adjustments to City spending plans mid-way through a fiscal year in response to unanticipated revenue shortfalls result in unacceptable disruptions to essential City services and operations; and

 WHEREAS, it is the intent of the Mayor and City Council to avoid mid- year reductions to City spending plans by establishing a reserve that would be used to offset revenue shortfalls, and would be funded by (1) direct appropriations and (2) tax revenues that are greater than anticipated; and

 WHEREAS, since Ordinance 116497 was passed in 1992, Seattle Municipal Code 5.80.030D has authorized investment earnings attributable to the entire Capital Projects Account in the Cumulative Reserve Subfund to be deposited into the Unrestricted Subaccount of the Capital Projects Account, but that practice is not clearly reflected in Seattle Municipal Code 5.06.030B; and

 WHEREAS, when the structure of the Cumulative Reserve Subfund was changed by Ordinance 117977, passed in 1995, the cross-references in Section 5.80.030 of the Seattle Municipal Code were not updated to be consistent with the new names of the accounts and sub-accounts; Now therefore,
