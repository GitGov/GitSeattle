 AN ORDINANCE related to public works, concentration banking services, and the purchase of goods and services governed by SMC 3.18.800 and provided by firms which have significant direct investments in Burma.

 WHEREAS, the military regime of Burma (also known as Myanmer, but hereinafter referred to as Burma) has institutionalized torture and rape as political instruments and embarked upon campaigns of forcible relocation, forced labor and slavery, and persecution of ethnic minorities, and other human rights violations, thereby denying the majority of the population the right to participate in the political process, to benefit from the system of justice, or to exercise economic rights; and

 WHEREAS, the people of Burma voted overwhelmingly for the National League for Democracy (NLD), headed by Nobel Peace Laureate Aung San Suu Kyi, and the NLD calls for sanctions and consumer boycotts; and

 WHEREAS, President Clinton announced a ban on new U.S. investment in Burma in April, 1997; and

 WHEREAS, the United States Supreme Court has upheld the power of a municipality to make legitimate economic decisions without being subject to the restraints of the Interstate Commerce Clause when it participates in the market place as a corporation or citizen as opposed to exerting its regulatory powers; and

 WHEREAS, the state of Massachusetts and a total of eighteen U.S. cities, including the cities of Oakland, San Francisco and New York City have passed selective purchasing ordinances and more are considering such measures; and

 WHEREAS, Burma is an economically undeveloped country where economic boycotts may have a significant impact; and

 WHEREAS, in 1995, the Seattle City Council passed and the Mayor signed Resolution 29077 supporting the establishment of democracy and a free and open society in Burma, and appropriate action by the U.S. government to achieve these goals; and

 WHEREAS, this ordinance would not be in violation of the World Trade Organization rules as confirmed by the US Trade Representative's Office; and

 WHEREAS, this ordinance is not establishing trade or foreign policy but rather allows the city to determine purchasing criteria with similar latitude to any other consumer in the market under the market participant doctrine which was applied to similar sanctions against South Africa in the past; and

 WHEREAS, this ordinance is not in violation of Initiative 30 for Responsible Immigration, since the City passed the anti-apartheid resolution after the Initiative was passed and the City Law Department has issued a ruling that Initiative 30 is non-binding; and

 WHEREAS, this ordinance would not be financially or administratively burdensome since no current city contracts are currently affected and to enforce the ordinance the City can subscribe to the Investor Responsibility Research Center (IRRC), a quarterly report identifying all companies doing business in Burma; and

 WHEREAS, the Investor Responsibility Research Center (IRRC) is the recognized source of Burma investment data used by municipalities and institutions implementing selective purchase programs; NOW THEREFORE,
