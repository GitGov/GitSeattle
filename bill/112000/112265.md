 WHEREAS, said station area planning and development effort requires technical expertise in market analysis, economic development, and urban design and logistical support for work with diverse stakeholders interested in such matters, for which the City has entered into an agreement with a team of consultants led by Dyett & Bhatia, Urban and Regional Planners; NOW, THEREFORE,
