 AN ORDINANCE relating to the Seattle Design Commission; changing the method by which the Design Commission charges City departments for Commission review of City capital improvement projects for projects for which billing commences after December 31, 1998; clarifying the basis for the Commission's fees for reviewing projects other than City capital improvement projects; and amending sections 22.900D.170 and 3.58.090 of the Seattle Municipal Code.

 Whereas, the Seattle Design Commission was established to provide design guidance to City departments so that capital improvement projects are constructed according to the best possible design principles; and

 Whereas, the City is about to embark on significant capital improvement projects such as the libraries to be built under the recently passed Library Capital Facilities ballot measure; and,

 Whereas the upcoming completion of 37 neighborhood plans and the increasing funding available through the Neighborhood Matching Fund will result in significant new investments in large and small capital improvement projects in Seattle's neighborhoods; and

 Whereas the existing funding mechanism for the Design Commission has proved to be administratively cumbersome and often inadequate to cover the costs of the Commission; and

 Whereas the Mayor desires to provide the Commission with a predictable and adequate funding mechanism so that it may fulfill its role in public development activities;

 Whereas the provisions for the Commission's fees charged for other than City capital improvement projects have been somewhat unclear; NOW, THEREFORE,

 BE IT ORDAINED BY THE CITY OF SEATTLE AS FOLLOWS:

 Section 1. Section 22.900D.170 of the Seattle Municipal Code is amended as follows:[SLC1]

 22.900D.170. Design Commission fees.

 A. City Capital Improvement Projects, as Defined in SMC Section 3.58.020. Design Commission fees shall be assessed at a rate of three-tenths of one (0.3) percent of the construction cost ~~of~~for City capital improvement projects for which billing will commence on or before December 31, 1998 , except as specified in subsections B and D of this section. Billing will occur at the time of contract award by the Executive Services Department, who will forward the bills to the Department for distribution to appropriate City departments. Payment will be made through a fund transfer to the Department Operating Fund.

 B. Major City Capital Improvement Projects. Except as specified in subsection D of this section, Design Commission fees shall be assessed at a rate of up to three-tenths of one (0.3) percent of the construction cost ~~of~~for major City capital improvement projects (greater than Ten Million Dollars ($10,000,000) construction budget) for which billing will commence on or before December 31, 1998. The fee shall be set through negotiations with the Budget Director and the Design Commission. Billing shall occur in accordance with a schedule agreed upon by the Budget Director and the Design Commission.

C. 1. For City capital improvement projects, as defined in section 3.58.020, for which no billing commenced under subsections A or B on or before December 31, 1998, and that do not fall within an exception in subsection D of this section, the Budget Director, the Design Commission, and each affected City department will attempt to agree on that department's projects, that are expected to be assessed by the Design Commission in the following year. If no agreement is reached by a date established by the Budget Director, the Budget Director will establish the list of such projects. The Budget Director may establish the assessable appropriation of a City capital improvement below the actual appropriation in order that the project not be assessed an unduly high fee relative to the cost of the anticipated Design Commission review.

2. The Budget Director will assess a uniform fee of up to one percent (1%) of the total of all departments' capital improvement project appropriations for those projects assessable for Design Commission fees. Such fee shall be set so as to be sufficient, when combined with other funding sources, to support the anticipated costs of the Design Commission for the following year, but in no case shall the fee exceed one percent (1%)

3. The Director of Design, Construction and Land Use shall bill each department in the amount determined by the Budget Director, and that amount shall be paid by fund transfer to the Department Operating Fund.

4. If a capital improvement project's appropriation has been included in a fee assessed under this section, but Design Commission review of that project is delayed into a future year, that appropriation amount shall not be counted again in the calculation of the fee for any future year. If review of a project on which a fee has been assessed under this subsection C is canceled, or if review commences on a project that, but for timeliness, would have been included but was not included in the calculation of a fee under this subsection C, the Budget Director shall adjust the department's total assessable appropriation downwards or upwards, respectively, when establishing the subsequent year's fee.

~~C.~~D. Special Exceptions.~~Rather than assessing fees as a percentage of the construction cost as described in subsections A and B of this section~~, ~~low income and special needs housing projects subject to Design Commission review and~~~~projects with total construction budgets of Fifty Thousand Dollars ($50,000) or less will be billed at the hourly rate of One Hundred Dollars ($100) per hour per Commissioner for subcommittee review, or Seven Hundred Dollars ($700) per hour for full Commission review. Fees for review of these projects may be waived at the discretion of the Commission.~~ )) The Commission will bill the following projects at the hourly rate of One Hundred Dollars ($100) per hour per Commissioner for subcommittee review, or Seven Hundred Dollars ($700) per hour for full Commission review, except that fees may be waived, in whole or in part, at the discretion of the Commission with the concurrence of the Budget Director in the following circumstances:  Whenever Commission fees, if charged, would be disproportionate to the sums available and could cause abandonment of the project for the following types of projects: artworks, projects funded by grants and donations, neighborhood self-help projects undertaken by volunteers and nonprofit organizations, and small capital improvements.

 For low-income and special needs housing projects subject to Design Commission review.

~~D.~~ E. Street Use Permit Reviews.

Billing will be sent ~~directly to the applicant)~~to Seattle Transportation for inclusion into the plan review costs charged to the applicant, or be billed directly by the Department.  For those projects billed through Seattle Transportation, payment will be made by a fund transfer from the Seattle Transportation Operating Fund to the Department Operating Fund from funds paid by the applicant.

~~E.~~F. Early Master Use Permit Stage or Projects Outside City Contract Process. For design review at an early Master Use Permit stage or for projects outside The City of Seattle contract award process, Design Commission fees will be billed by the Department at an hourly rate of One Hundred Dollars ($100) per hour per Commissioner for subcommittee review, or Seven Hundred Dollars ($700) per hour for full Commission review.
