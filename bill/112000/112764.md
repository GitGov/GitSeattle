 AN ORDINANCE relating to emergency repairs due to landslides during the 1999 winter, making a supplemental and partially reimbursable appropriation from the Emergency Subfund for identified projects of Seattle Transportation, authorizing the Director of Seattle Transportation to enter into agreements with the Washington State Department of Transportation, and increasing the 1999 expenditure allowances of Seattle Transportation, authorizing work to proceed and declaring an emergency therefor; all by a three fourths vote of the City Council.

 WHEREAS, the severe weather conditions and storms of the 1999 winter resulted in damage to City facilities that the City has determined are in need of repair to protect public safety; and

 WHEREAS, the Mayor, on June 15, 1999 signed a Proclamation of Civil Emergency related to the winter storms of 1999, authorizing City departments to proceed with necessary repair work; and

 WHEREAS, the winter storms saturated the ground resulting in landslides that continued to occur into March of 1999; and

 WHEREAS, some of the expenses relating to these repair projects and other storm costs are eligible for reimbursement from the Federal Highway Administration; Now Therefore,

 BE IT ORDAINED BY THE CITY OF SEATTLE AS FOLLOWS:

 Section 1. The Director of Seattle Transportation is hereby authorized to proceed with clean up, landslide damage repairs, facility repairs, engineering studies, and other costs for the projects listed in Attachment A, which projects were made necessary as a result of storms occurring during the months of January, February and March 1999. Within budget authority, the Director of Seattle Transportation is authorized to enter into such agreements, easements, and property acquisitions with other City departments, governments, private organizations, firms, and individuals as are necessary to carry out and complete said activities. To pay for these activities, the expenditure allowances in the 1999 Budget of Seattle Transportation are increased in the amount of Five Million Five Hundred Thousand Dollars ($5,500,000). For these purposes , the sum of Five Million Five Hundred Thousand Dollars ($5,500,000), or so much thereof as may be necessary, is hereby appropriated from the General Fund, Emergency Subfund, Emergency Account, to be partially reimbursed by, the Federal Highway Administration, and the State of Washington

 Section 2. The Director of Seattle Transportation is hereby authorized to enter into agreements with the Washington State Department of Transportation to accept funds from that agency's allocation of Surface Transportation Program funds to immediately reimburse all eligible costs incurred on the events listed in Attachment A since January 27,1999 and to effect such repairs and take other such actions as therein described. All such costs will be reimbursed to the maximum extent allowable by law.

 Section 3. These appropriations from the Emergency Subfund shall be reimbursed to the maximum extent possible from the proceeds of grants received from the Federal Highway Administration, and the State of Washington. Such funds when received are hereby accepted for such purposes and shall be deposited into the Emergency Subfund.

 Section 5. Unexpended and unencumbered portions of the foregoing appropriations shall carry forward automatically to Fiscal Year 2000.

 Section 6. The unusually heavy rains during the months of January , February and March of 1999 caused landslides which damaged City transportation facilities as itemized in Attachment A and the cover letter in this ordinance file. City forces, emergency contractors and technical consultants worked diligently to determine the best approach to remedying problems at each site once conditions permitted; however ground conditions were such that solutions and estimates were not finalized until mid-June 1999. If the planned work is not done immediately, the City risks further exacerbation of existing problems and risk of harm to the public safety and to City facilities due to the loss of favorable construction conditions. Therefore the City Council finds that an emergency exists in which it is necessary for the preservation of the public safety and convenience that this ordinance become effective without delay.

 Section 7. The foregoing appropriations are made for expenses and obligations caused by a storm that could not have been anticipated at the time of the adoption of the 1999 Budget, Now, Therefore, in accordance with RCW 35.32A.060(1) by reason of the facts stated above, this ordinance shall take effect immediately upon approval or signing of the same by the Mayor or passage over his veto, as provided by the Charter of the City.

 Section 8. Any acts made consistent with the authority and prior to the effective date of this ordinance are hereby ratified and confirmed.
