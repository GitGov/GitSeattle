Public use and necessity require that the Property be condemned, appropriated, taken, and damaged for the construction of the Project as provided by this ordinance if negotiations fail to produce an agreement.

 Section 2. Declaration of Necessity. After reviewing the written and oral reports of Project staff and the planned improvements for the Project and, after considering the planned uses and need for the Property, the Seattle City Council hereby declares that the Property is necessary for the City's public use (i.e., for the construction of the Project, and for the City's use for parking and safety reasons following the construction and completion of the Project).

 Section 3. Condemnation. The Property shall be, and the same is hereby condemned, appropriated, taken, and damaged in fee simple. The Property shall be so appropriated and taken only after just compensation has been made or paid into court for the owner thereof in the manner provided by law.

 Section 4. Authority. The Director of the Executive Services Department, or his or her designee, is authorized, on behalf of the City of Seattle, to appraise and to negotiate for agreements to acquire in fee simple at fair market value, the real property described in Exhibit A.

 Section 5. Authority of City Attorney. The City Attorney, or his or her designated representative, is hereby authorized and directed to begin and prosecute the proceedings provided by law to condemn, take, damage, and appropriate the Property to carry out the provisions of this ordinance. The City Attorney is authorized in conducting said condemnation proceedings, for the purpose of minimizing damages, to stipulate as to the use of the Property hereby authorized to be condemned and appropriated.

 Section 6. Severability. If any section, sentence, clause or phrase of this ordinance should be held to be invalid or unconstitutional by a court of competent jurisdiction, such invalidity or unconstitutionality shall not affect the validity or constitutionality of any other section, sentence, clause, or phrase of this ordinance.

 Section 7. Costs. The cost of the acquisition including, but not limited to, the purchase price, appraisals, environmental site assessments, closing costs, real estate professional services and title insurance, shall be paid from the Parking Garage subfund of the Civic Center Fund.
