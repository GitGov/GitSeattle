 Background

 Leonard E. and Laurie Ann Rose formed Rose & Associates, L.L.C. in July of 1996 and purchased the leasehold interest in the Promenade Red Apple Market ("Market"), located at 2701 Beacon Avenue South (in the Promenade 23 shopping area), along with inventory and fixtures on September 14, 1997 for $1,735,000. Associated Grocers (AG), Inc. financed $1,323,000 of the purchase price on a seven year note, while the remaining $412,000 was financed by AG for five years.

 The Roses have made management improvements and involved the community that contributed to an increase in weekly sales from $108,000 under the old management, to $150,000 under the Roses. However, due to increased competition, the Market has yet to reach its anticipated sales levels.

 Project Description

 The float loan will allow the Roses to make some improvements benefiting the community while accelerating their principal pay- down over the loan term, positioning the Market to continue with less debt when Associated Grocers reinstates its loan following the thirty month term of the Float Loan. The Market improvements will enhance the range of goods and services in the low-and moderate income area its serves including: greater availability of dairy products for W.I.C. program recipients, an expanded customer service center (bill payment services, UPS center, Postal and Metro Bus Pass purchase center), and increased ethnic products lines catering to the specific cultural needs of the community. The new and expanded services and facilities to be provided are described more fully below:

 xpenditure Currently, with limited dairy cases, the Market cannot carry adequate dairy products. This is especially critical under the W.I.C. program (Women, Infant and Children). Approximately 15% to 20% of the Market's customer base is eligible for W.I.C. program benefits and the Market is the area's primary Market for W.I.C. purchasers. The added dairy cases will significantly increase the Market's ability to carry approved W.I.C. products.

 xpenditure The new Customer Service Center will provide Moneygram, Travelers Express Money Orders, METRO Bus Passes and U.S. Postal Stamps. The expansion will also allow the center to add utility payment drop-off services, a mail center with UPS service and a phone payment service. These services will be of special benefit to the area's elderly and low income residents who have limited access to transportation.

 xpenditure The expanded deli and bakery will provide a greater variety of good quality ethnic fast food. Currently there is no availability of these product categories in the neighborhood. Current customers have requested a greater emphases in these product lines.

 xpenditure The new Market design will increase safety. Currently customers enter and exit through a central doorway directly into the traffic lanes. The new layout will provide for greater customer safety by channeling customers to side entrances away from vehicular traffic. In addition to increased safety, the new design will give the Market a more modern, brighter and more appealing front.

 xpenditure The new meat counters will allow the Market to carry increased lines of meat and seafood. These cases will also allow for better handling and greater energy efficiency in compliance with Health Department rules.

 The Float Loan will assist a financially improving community- based store to remain competitive and to preserve 40 jobs, 80% of which are minority.

Section 85.36(e)(2), and shall maintain records of those steps.

 (e) Benefit to Low- and Moderate Income People. Borrower's installation of leasehold improvements and use of the Property shall benefit low- and moderate-income persons (as defined by HUD) to the maximum extent feasible.

 (f) Conflict of Interest; Consultants. Borrower shall ensure compliance with the provisions of 24 C.F.R. Section 570.611, which provide generally that no officer, agent, employee, consultant or elected or appointed official of The City of Seattle or of any subrecipient or designated public agency receiving CDBG funds who exercises or has exercised any functions or responsibilities with respect to activities assisted by CDBG funds or who is in a position to participate in a decisionmaking process or gain inside information with respect to these activities, shall obtain any financial interest or benefit from or have and financial interest in, for himself or herself or those with whom he or she has business or immediate family ties, any activity funded under this Agreement or any contract or subcontract or agreement with respect thereto or the proceeds thereof; nor shall (s)he, for one year after completion of his or her tenure with the City or such subrecipient or designated public agency, obtain or have any such financial interest or benefit. Borrower represents and warrants that to the best of its knowledge no such person has any financial interest in or benefit from any such existing contract or subcontract or the proceeds thereof, and Borrower shall incorporate in all such contracts or subcontracts to be entered into for the Project after the date of this Agreement a provision prohibiting any such interest or benefit.

Part 24. Borrower shall obtain, and shall require contractors and subcontractors to obtain, the certification required by appendix B of 24 CFR part 24 from each prospective contractor or subcontractor on the Project.

Borrower agrees that the City may, at its option, provide relocation assistance directly to any person in connection with the Project and that any payment by the City for such person, at the City's sole option, may be charged against any funds remaining to be disbursed hereunder without any requirement for a draw request by, or consent of, Borrower.

 5.2 Certain City Requirements: Non-discrimination; Fair Employment; WMBE

 (a) Discrimination Prohibited

 During the performance of this Agreement, neither Borrower nor any party contracting with Borrower who would be paid with Loan funds under this Agreement shall discriminate on the basis of race, color, sex, religion, national origin, creed, marital status, sexual orientation, age or the presence of any sensory, mental or physical handicap in employment or application for employment or in the administration or delivery of services or any other benefits under this Agreement.

 The Borrower shall comply and shall require all contractors and subcontractors to comply fully with all applicable federal, state and local laws, ordinances, executive orders and regulations which prohibit such discrimination. These laws include, but are not limited to, Chapter 49.60 of the Revised Code of Washington, Titles VI and VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and Chapters 14.04 and 20.44 of the Seattle Municipal Code.

 (b) Fair Employment Practices

 Borrower acknowledges notice of the following excerpted from Seattle Municipal Code Chapter 14.04.020, as amended:

 It is declared to be the policy of the City, in the exercise of its police powers for the protection of the public health, safety, and general welfare, and for the maintenance of peace and good government, to assure equal opportunity to all persons, free from restrictions because of race, color, sex, marital status, sexual orientation, political ideology, age, creed, religion, ancestry, national origin, or the presence of any sensory, mental or physical handicap.

 (c) Women's and Minority Business Enterprise Utilization Ordinance

 (1) This contract hereby incorporates by reference Seattle Municipal Code (SMC) Ch. 20.46A (the "Women's & Minority Business Utilization Ordinance" or "WMBE Ordinance"). The purpose of Seattle's Women and Minority Business Enterprises ("WMBE") Program is to provide a prompt remedy for the effects of past discrimination. The failure of the contractor or any subcontractor to comply with any of the requirements of SMC Ch. 20.46A shall be a material breach of contract. The City in general, and its WMBE Program in particular, are damaged when a contract, or portion of a contract, to be performed by a WBE or MBE is not actually performed by a WBE or MBE in compliance with SMC Ch. 20.46A. Because the actual amount of such damage is not reasonably calculable, the parties agree and stipulate that liquidated damages equal to the unmet dollar amount of any WBE or MBE set-aside will fairly compensate the City for resulting delays in carrying out the purpose of the Program, the costs of meeting utilization targets through additional contracts, the administrative costs of investigation and enforcement, and other damages and costs caused by the violation.

 (2) Borrower understands and agrees that Borrower must comply as a "contract awarding authority" with the WMBE Ordinance, except to the extent that an exemption may be granted by the City's Department of Executive Services. During the term of this Agreement, and through the completion of the Project, Borrower shall:

 a. Ensure that each contractor meets the set-asides for Women's Business Enterprises ("WBEs") and Minority Business Enterprises ("MBEs") established for the contract, if any;

 b. Make affirmative efforts to utilize WMBEs in performing the contract, whether as contractors, subcontractors, suppliers, or in any other capacity;

 c. Require that all contractors and subcontractors make affirmative efforts to utilize WMBEs in performance of the contract;

 d. Maintain records reasonably necessary for monitoring compliance with the provisions of SMC Ch. 20.46A, and submit such information as may be requested by the City's Executive Services Director in order to monitor and enforce compliance;

 e. Require that contractors and subcontractors maintain records reasonably necessary for monitoring the contractors' and subcontractors' compliance with the provisions of SMC Ch. 20.46A, and that the contractors and subcontractors submit such information as may be requested by the City's Executive Services Director in order to monitor and enforce compliance; and

 f. Include in all contracts for the Project (whether entered into directly by Borrower or by a tenant of Borrower or other third party) the provisions required by the WMBE Ordinance, including without limitation the provisions of subsection (1) of this Section, above, with the following language added thereto:

 "The City is an intended third-party beneficiary of this provision and shall have the right to enforce it directly against the contractor. No waiver or modification by the parties of any provision of this contract regarding WMBE requirements shall be binding upon the City."

 5.3 Political Activity.

 No portion of the Loan shall be used for any partisan political activity or to further the election or defeat of any candidate for public office or to influence the approval or defeat of any ballot issue or legislation.

 ARTICLE VI -- DEFAULT AND REMEDIES

 6.1 Event of Default. Occurrence of any of the following events shall constitute an Event of Default hereunder:

 (a) Any failure by Borrower to pay when due any principal, interest or other amounts owing to City under any of the Loan Documents;

 (c) Any breach by Borrower of any of the other non-monetary covenants and conditions of this Agreement which breach is not cured to City's satisfaction within ten (10) working days from the occurrence thereof, provided, that in the event of a nonmonetary breach or default by Borrower which is outside of the control of Borrower and which cannot be cured within said ten (10) working days, Borrower shall have commenced to cure its breach or default within said ten (10) working days and thereafter diligently proceeds to cure its breach or default.

 (d) Any representation, warranty or disclosure made to City by Borrower related to this Loan or the Project proves to be materially false or misleading as of the date when made, whether or not such representation, warranty or disclosure appears in this Agreement.

 (e) A petition in bankruptcy or for reorganization or for an arrangement under any bankruptcy or insolvency law or for a receiver or trustee for any of Borrower's property, is filed by Borrower, or is filed against Borrower and is not dismissed within forty-five (45) days, or if Borrower makes an assignment for the benefit of creditors or becomes insolvent or unable to pay its debts as they mature or any attachment or execution is levied against a substantial portion of the property of Borrower and is not discharged within forty-five (45) days.

 (f) There occurs any event which in City's reasonable judgment adversely affects (i) the ability of Borrower to perform any of its obligations hereunder or under any of the Loan Documents (ii) the business or financial condition of Borrower; or (iii) compliance with the Act.

 ARTICLE VII -- MISCELLANEOUS

 7.1 No Waiver. No waiver of any default or breach by Borrower hereunder shall be implied from any failure by City to take action on account of such default if such default persists or is repeated, and no express waiver shall affect any default other than the default specified in the waiver and shall be operative only for the time and to the extent therein stated. Waivers of any covenants, term or condition contained herein shall not be construed as a waiver of any subsequent breach of the same covenant, term or condition. The consent or approval by City to, or approval of, any act by Borrower requiring consent or approval shall not be deemed to waive or render unnecessary the consent or approval to, or of, any subsequent similar act.

 7.2 Successors and Assigns; Assignment. This Agreement is made and entered into for the sole protection and benefit of the City, Borrower, and their successors and assigns, and no other person or persons shall have any right of action hereunder, except to the extent that specific provisions grant rights to the State or federal governments.

 PROMISSORY NOTE

 PROMENADE RED APPLE MARKET PROJECT CDBG FLOAT LOAN

 $2,075,000.00 ______________, 1998

 Seattle, Washington

 FOR VALUE RECEIVED, the undersigned, Rose & Associates, L.L.C., a Washington limited liability company ("Borrower"), promises to pay to the order of The City of Seattle, a Washington municipal corporation ("City"), at its Office of Economic Development, 600 Fourth Avenue, Seattle, Washington 98104, or such other place as the holder of this Note may from time to time designate, the principal sum of TWO MILLION SEVENTY-FIVE THOUSAND DOLLARS ($2,075,000.00) or so much thereof as may be advanced hereunder (the "Loan"), plus interest as provided below. This Note is made pursuant to the terms of the Community Development Block Grant Float Loan Agreement between the Borrower and City dated on or about the date hereof (the "Loan Agreement"). Capitalized terms not defined herein shall have the meanings set forth in the Loan Agreement unless the context otherwise clearly requires. Disbursement of the Loan evidenced by this Note is to be made subject to the terms and conditions of the Loan Agreement.

 Interest. Borrower agrees to pay interest from the date funds are advanced at a rate of ___ percent (___%) per annum, computed on the outstanding principal balance as it exists from time to time.

 3. Principal and Interest Payments. Borrower shall make monthly installment payments of principal and interest owing hereunder in the amount of TWENTY-SIX THOUSAND NINE HUNDRED FIFTY-TWO AND 51/100 DOLLARS ($26,952.51) on or before the seventh day of each calendar month, commencing with the month after the month in which the first Loan disbursement is made and continuing until the Maturity Date set forth below or until the Loan is repaid in full, if earlier. Any prepayment of principal or partial payment of principal pursuant to demand under Section 6 below shall not reduce the required monthly payment amount unless expressly agreed in writing by the holder of this Note.

 Maturity; Demand Feature. The principal balance outstanding hereon, together with all accrued and unpaid interest and any other sums due hereunder, shall be due and payable in full on the earliest of (i) ten (10) calendar days after demand by the holder hereof for full repayment under Section 5 below, or (ii) the date ("Maturity Date") thirty (30) months after the date of this Note, or (iii) thirty (30) days prior to the expiration date of the Letter of Credit (as defined below). Borrower acknowledges that demands for payment may be made by the holder of this Note at any time for any reason.

 Letter of Credit. This Note shall be secured by an unconditional, irrevocable letter of credit (the "Letter of Credit"), payable upon demand, issued by a banking institution mutually agreeable to Borrower and the holder of this Note, all as more fully set forth in the Loan Agreement.

 Demands for Full or Partial Payment. The holder of this Note has the absolute right to make demand for full or partial payment of principal and accrued interest at any time for any reason regardless of Borrower's full compliance with all terms of the Loan Documents. The holder shall make such demand in writing, by hand delivery, mailing or facsimile transmission in the manner set forth in the Loan Agreement. Payments pursuant to a demand under this section shall be due and payable on or before ten (10) calendar days from the date the demand is effective under the notice provisions of the Loan Agreement. If the holder of this Note so specifies in the demand or other written communication, payment shall be made by a draw against the Letter of Credit, and the holder shall have the right to submit such draw at any time on or after on the tenth calendar day after such demand is effective. The requirements for demand and the notice period under this Section shall not apply in case of acceleration pursuant to any other provision of this Note or the Loan Agreement.

 Application of Payments. Payments under this Note shall be applied first to any costs or fees owing hereunder or under the Loan Agreement, next to accrued interest, and finally to the reduction of the principal of this Note. Any payment made at any time when any amount is due or past due from Borrower to the holder of this Note on the Hilltop Loan (as defined in the Loan Agreement) may, in the discretion of such holder, be applied in payment of all or part of such amount prior to any application to amounts owing under this Note.

 Prepayment. Provided that Borrower shall first give the holder of this Note thirty (30) calendar days' prior notice, the indebtedness evidenced hereby may be prepaid in whole or in part from time to time without premium or penalty. If so elected by the holder of this Note, any prepayment shall be made by draw against the Letter of Credit.

 Default and Acceleration. Should default be made in any payment when due or in the performance or observance of any of the covenants and agreements of this Note, or if there shall be an Event of Default under the Loan Agreement, the whole sum of principal and interest shall become immediately due and payable at the option of the holder without notice, and the holder shall have the right immediately to draw on the Letter of Credit. Failure to exercise the option to accelerate shall not constitute a waiver of the right to exercise it in the event of a continuing or subsequent default.

 Interest on Past Due Amounts. Whether or not the entire balance is accelerated, all amounts of principal and interest past due shall bear interest at the rate of twelve percent (12%) per annum from and after the due date.

 Sale of Property. Upon the sale, transfer or assignment, whether voluntary, involuntary or by operation of law, of all or substantially all of Borrower's interest in the Property (as such term is defined in the Loan Agreement), at its sole option the holder hereof may, by written notice to Borrower, declare all sums then outstanding hereunder to be immediately due and payable.

 Unconditional Obligations. The obligations of the Borrower under this Note are absolute, unconditional and irrevocable. All payments required hereunder shall be made without any setoff, counterclaim, deduction or withholding whatsoever.

 Waivers. Except for the demands described in Section 6 above, Borrower hereby waives diligence, demand, presentment for payment, and notice of whatever kind or nature. Without discharging or in any way affecting the liability of Borrower or any other person who may become liable on this Note, Borrower hereby consents to any and all extensions of this Note as the holder hereof may in its sole discretion grant from time to time, to the release of all or any part of the security for the payment hereof and to the release of any party liable for repayment of the obligations hereunder.

 Manner of Payment. All payments due on this Note shall be payable in lawful money of the United States of America at the time of payment. Unless otherwise provided in the Loan Agreement or requested by the holder of this Note, Borrower shall make all scheduled monthly payments hereunder to the holder hereof by check or wire transfer. All payments of principal other than as part of scheduled monthly payments shall be by drawing on the Letter of Credit unless otherwise approved in writing by the holder of this Note. At any time and in its discretion the holder hereof may require that any payment(s) shall be made by draws against the Letter of Credit,, or by cashier's check, or by cashier's check or wire transfer, as the holder shall elect. If the issuer of the Letter of Credit fails to honor any draw by the holder of this Note in full or in part, or if the amount remaining on the Letter of Credit is insufficient to pay the amount due on the Note, or in the event that the holder of this Note is required by any law or court order to refund or otherwise relinquish any portion of any amount received from any draw on the Letter of Credit, then Borrower shall pay the full balance due immediately on demand. Any such payment shall be in immediately available funds, and shall be made to the holder at the address first hereinabove indicated, or such other address as the holder may hereafter designate.

 Governing Law. This Note shall be governed by the laws of the State of Washington, except to the extent that Federal laws or regulations may preempt the laws of the State of Washington.

 Costs and Attorney's Fees. In the event that this Note is placed in the hands of an attorney at law for collection after maturity or upon default or in the event that proceedings at law or in equity are instituted in connection herewith, Borrower shall pay all costs of collecting or attempting to collect this Note and all costs incurred by the holder in any such proceedings, without limitation, reasonable attorney's fees (including costs and fees incurred in any bankruptcy, appellate, or arbitration proceeding); and all such amounts shall be secured by the Letter of Credit. "Reasonable attorney's fees" shall include the reasonable value of services of in-house counsel.

 No Usury. This Note and the Loan Agreement are subject to the limitation that in no event shall interest or any other amount paid or agreed to be paid for the use, forbearance or detention of money to be advanced hereunder or pursuant to the Loan Agreement exceed the highest lawful rate permissible under applicable usury laws, if any. If fulfillment of any provision hereof or of the Loan Agreement shall be deemed by a court of competent and final jurisdiction to violate any applicable usury restrictions, then ipso facto, the obligation to be fulfilled shall be reduced to the limit of such validity, and any amount received in excess of such limit shall be applied to reduce the unpaid principal balance hereof and not to the payment of interest.

 Time. Time is of the essence of this Note and of each and every provision hereof.

 Purpose. Borrower represents and warrants that this Note is made, and the proceeds hereof are to be used, solely for business and commercial purposes, and not for personal, consumer, household or family purposes.

 NOTICE: ORAL AGREEMENTS OR ORAL COMMITMENTS TO LOAN MONEY, EXTEND CREDIT, TO FORBEAR FROM ENFORCING REPAYMENT OF A DEBT, ARE NOT ENFORCEABLE UNDER WASHINGTON LAW.

 IN WITNESS WHEREOF, Borrower has executed this Promissory Note as of the date first above written.
