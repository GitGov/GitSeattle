 ORDINANCE _________________

 WHEREAS, a Lot Boundary Adjustment is sought which will eliminate an encroachment onto property held for park purposes; and

 WHEREAS, equivalent property has been identified that is acceptable as in kind replacement property for the park land to be transferred to accomplish the Lot Boundary Adjustment; and

 WHEREAS, the parcels proposed for exchange have been appraised and the fair market value of the parcel to be deeded to the City equals the fair market value of the parcel to be deeded by the City; and
