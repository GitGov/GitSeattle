 WHEREAS, the Husky Stadium Advisory Group has considered public and expert comment and information regarding the parking impacts of current and potentially future Husky Stadium Events and recommends that a separate offense for parking in a Husky Stadium Event Restricted Parking Zone be enacted for the peace, health, safety and welfare of the people of the City of Seattle; and

 WHEREAS, the neighborhoods surrounding Husky Stadium continue to suffer adverse parking impacts from Husky Stadium Events; and

 WHEREAS, the responsibility of administering the City's Restricted Parking Zones now rests with the Seattle Transportation Department;

 NOW THEREFORE,

 BE IT ORDAINED BY THE CITY OF SEATTLE AS FOLLOWS:

 Section 1. A new Section 11.72.352 is hereby added to the Seattle Municipal Code, to read as follows:

 11.72.352 Husky Stadium Event Restricted Parking Zone.

 No person shall stop, stand or park a vehicle in violation of a posted or marked Husky Stadium Event Restricted Parking Zone unless a permit or other authorization issued by the city or card or decal issued pursuant to RCW 46.16.381 or recognized under RCW 46.16.390 is displayed in a prominent place on the vehicle.

 Section 2. Section 11.73.060 of the Seattle Municipal Code, which was enacted by Ordinance 112988 Section 2, is amended as follows:

 11.73.060 Husky Stadium Event Restricted Parking Zone-Applicable provisions.

 The Husky Stadium Event Restricted Parking Zone shall be considered a "restricted parking zone" for purposes of the following Seattle Municipal Code Sections:

 11.14.515, Restricted parking zone - Definition;

 11.28.010, Abuse of privileges in restricted parking zones; ~~and~~

~~11.72.351, Restricted parking zone~~.)) 11.72.352, Husky Stadium Event Restricted Parking Zone; and  11.30.040, When a vehicle may be impounded without prior notice.

 The provisions of each of these sections, insofar as consistent with Section 11.73.050, shall apply to the Husky Stadium Event Restricted Parking Zone.

 Section 3. Section 11.73.050 of the Seattle Municipal Code, which was last amended by Ordinance 115995 Section 18, is amended as follows:

 11.73.050 Husky Stadium Event Restricted Parking Zone.

 A. There is established a Husky Stadium Event Restricted Parking Zone ("the zone") in the ~~Montlake~~~~neighborhood~~areas within the outer boundary of the secondary impact area as delineated in the City-University Agreement and shown on the map contained in ~~Attachment~~Exhibit "A" ~~and including the street segments identified in Attachment "B."~~

 B. On dates with events likely to attract twenty-four thousand (24,000) or more people to Husky Stadium, and after following procedures set forth in SMC 11.16.317 , the Director of~~City Engineer~~Transportation is authorized to restrict public parking on eligible streets within the zone to vehicles of: 1. Residents of the zone; 2. Owners of businesses in the zone and used for business purposes; 3. Service vehicles of persons having business in the street or used for law enforcement purposes; 4. Nonresidents

 with a handicapped card, decal or special license plate issued pursuant to RCW 46.61.580; and 5. Subject to such restrictions as may be established by the Director of ~~Engineering~~ Transportation, guests of residents of the zone.

 C. The restrictions on public parking shall be designed to exclude or restrict public parking only to the extent reasonably needed to preserve the capacity of the streets for travel and transportation during the event, to maintain for the residents only the parking needed, and to alleviate hazards of too closely packed parking, such as impairing sightlines or turning at driveways and intersections, blocking in residential vehicles and other unsafe practices. Restrictions on public parking may be placed on certain streets or block segments while others remain open, the restricted streets may be relocated from year to year, and restrictions may be changed from time to time.

 D. The restrictions upon or exclusion of public parking shall only be in effect on the dates with events likely to attract twenty-four thousand (24,000) or more people to Husky Stadium. The dates shall be stated on traffic-control devices in the zone. The restriction shall commence at times set by the Director of ~~Engineer~~ Transportation, which shall not be more than three (3) hours before the event is scheduled to begin nor continue more than two hours after the event is over. A restriction shall be given effect although the traffic-control device(s) in the immediate block or street segment may have been removed, damaged or obscured by theft, vandalism, weathering or other cause, if other traffic-control devices in the vicinity or a parking control or peace officer gives general notice to the public of the restriction.

 Section 4. This ordinance shall take effect and be in force thirty (30) days from and after its approval by the Mayor, but if not approved and returned by the Mayor within ten (10) days after presentation, it shall take effect as provided by Municipal Code Section 1.04.020.
