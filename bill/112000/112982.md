 This first amendatory agreement is entered into by and between THE CITY OF SEATTLE (hereinafter referred to as "CITY"), a municipal corporation of the State of Washington, acting by and through its Seattle Center Department and the Director thereof (hereinafter referred to as "Department" and "Director", respectively), and SEATTLE THUNDERBIRDS HOCKEY CLUB, INC. (hereinafter referred to as "LICENSEE"), a for-profit corporation organized and existing under the laws of the State of Washington.

 On or about October 1, 1997, pursuant to Ordinance 118733, CITY entered into an Agreement with LICENSEE regarding the use and occupancy of Seattle Center facilities in connection with the playing of ice hockey games (hereinafter referred to as the "Agreement");

 The CITY and the LICENSEE desire to amend the terms of the Agreement to extend the term for two additional years, to increase the License Fees for the extended term, and to make other miscellaneous changes;

 NOW THEREFORE, in consideration of the mutual covenants hereinafter contained, the parties agree to amend the Agreement as follows:

 I. AMENDMENT OF SECTION II: Section II of the Agreement is amended to read as follows:

 TERM OF AGREEMENT; ONE-YEAR NOTICE REQUIREMENT; OPTION TO EXTEND

 A. Term:

 The Term of this Agreement shall commence July 1, 1997, and expire June 30, 2002, unless terminated earlier pursuant to the provisions hereof, or extended for one additional year as provided below.

 B. One-year Notice Requirement if Either CITY or LICENSEE Does Not Intend to Continue a License Agreement.

 If either party does not intend to continue a License Agreement between CITY and LICENSEE beyond June 30, 2002, said party is required to provide notice to the other party by June 30, 2001. If no such notice is provided, the parties shall commence to negotiate a License Agreement for the period beginning July 1, 2002 for such terms and conditions as are mutually agreed to and authorized by CITY and LICENSEE. If the parties do not reach agreement on such terms and conditions, this Agreement shall extend for one additional year, until June 30, 2003, under the existing terms and conditions, provided that for the period July 1, 2002 to June 30, 2003 the Minimum License Fee for thirty-six (36) regular season Home Games and the first two (2) play-off Home Games shall increase by the CPI in accordance with Section IX. C. of this Agreement, and further provided that LICENSEE has cured any breach that has occurred before June 30, 2002.

 II. AMENDMENT OF SECTION III: Section III of the Agreement is amended to read as follows:

 A. Selection of Pre- & Regular Season KeyArena Use Dates:

 1. Each year by February 15, the Director shall provide LICENSEE with a list of each potential date, the total number of such dates to be not less than Fifty-One (51), occurring between September 24th and the next succeeding March 31st on which a regular season Home Game could be presented in the KeyArena. At least one-third of these dates (not less than 17) shall be either a Friday or a Saturday, including Saturdays shared with the SuperSonics, and not less than eight of these Fridays and Saturdays shall fall during the months of January, February and March. The Director shall also provide LICENSEE with a calendar showing all potential game dates offered to the SuperSonics, and showing which other dates between September 24th and the next succeeding March 31 are either contractually committed or tentatively held for other events.

 2. All dates during the WHL regular season offered to, but not used by, the SuperSonics as game dates shall become available to LICENSEE for scheduling of Home Games.

 3. At the earliest possible date, and no later than seven (7) days after the official release of the SuperSonics schedule, LICENSEE shall provide written notice to the Director regarding each potential regular season Home Game date listed by the Director pursuant to Subsection III.A.1 hereof, or subsequently made available to LICENSEE, that has been selected by the WHL as a Home Game date.

 4. Upon receipt of such notice, the Director shall confirm each such WHL-selected date by written endorsement notice to LICENSEE, and all dates not selected by the WHL for regular season Home Games shall become available for use by other parties.

 B. Scheduling of Playoff and Championship Games in KeyArena:

 From the date that Director confirms the regular season Home Game dates for the upcoming season pursuant to Subsection III.A.4 hereof, the Director shall hold dates in KeyArena for potential play-off Home Games for that season, as follows:

 1. For dates between the end of the WHL regular season and the end of the NBA regular season, Director shall hold dates for potential play- off Home Games unless such dates are: (a) scheduled for a SuperSonics regular season home game, or (b) contractually committed, or tentatively held for another event, provided that:

 * for the first three weekends (weekends here meaning Friday, Saturday, and Sunday) after the conclusion of the WHL regular season, Director shall hold the Friday and Saturday of each weekend for potential play-off Home Games, unless such dates are not available due to the scheduling of a SuperSonics regular season game or games; and if in any weekend the Friday and/or Saturday is not available, the Director shall hold the Sunday, unless such date is not available due to the scheduling of a SuperSonics regular season game.

 * within any consecutive seven-day time period, no fewer than four (4) days will be made available for play-off Home Games, unless the SuperSonics are scheduled to play four (4) regular season games in one week.

 2. For dates after the conclusion of the NBA regular season, LICENSEE shall have the first right, for the purpose of scheduling a play-off Home Game, for any play-off date being held for the SuperSonics and subsequently not used for a SuperSonics home play-off game. The Director shall make available to LICENSEE a copy of the official NBA playoff scheduling memorandum.

 3. The Director shall schedule and reserve the KeyArena for a play- off Home Game and confirm such date by written endorsement notice to LICENSE if, and only if, the WHL schedules the Seattle Team for such a play-off Home Game and LICENSEE gives notice to Director of the dates of such play-off Home Games.

 C. Scheduling Use of KeyArena for Other than a Home Game:

 LICENSEE may request the Director to schedule and reserve use of the KeyArena each hockey season for one (1) Seattle Team-related event other than a Home Game (such as a season ticket holder's reception or other promotional event) to occur on a day between September 24, and the next succeeding March 31. No admission fee shall be charged for such an event without the prior approval of the Director. The Director shall schedule and reserve the KeyArena for such use and confirm such LICENSEE-selected day by written endorsement notice to LICENSEE if and only if:

 1. The KeyArena is not being tentatively held, and has not been scheduled and reserved or contractually committed, for use on such day by a third party; and

 2. CITY has not planned to use the KeyArena, itself, or to perform maintenance, repair or improvement work therein, and the Director is willing and able to reschedule such CITY use, maintenance, repair or improvement work to a different date; and

 3. In the opinion of the Director, the KeyArena not only can be converted from the use configuration required by the immediately preceding user into the configuration and by the time desired by LICENSEE, but also can be reconverted from LICENSEE's desired configuration into the next succeeding user's desired configuration by such succeeding user's time deadline for such action.
