 AN ORDINANCE relating to Seattle Transportation, amending the Street Use Fee Schedule to add a new category of street use permits for shoreline street ends and to provide a fee therefor; amending the Street Use Ordinance (Ordinance 90047, as amended) and Sections 15.02.046, 15.04.35, 15.04.074 of the Seattle Municipal Code; setting forth a priority for use of the fees, and directing Seattle Transportation to draft and implement a plan for enforcement of the requirement for use and occupation permit on shoreline street ends, notification of owners of property abutting shoreline street ends of the increased fee, public education as to fee calculation methodology and of means to reduce the amount of the fee.

 WHEREAS, by Resolution 29370, in 1996 the Council adopted policies to guide the development of public access improvements to shoreline street ends, requiring their preservation as public right-of way, setting forth criteria to be employed in evaluating the suitability of a street end for public use improvements, and providing that new private use permits will be granted only when there is no active proposal for a public street improvement; and

 WHEREAS, the City Council now wishes to strengthen and clarify these policies, by adopting legislation intended to a) keep adjacent property owners from encroaching on the public's shoreline street- ends; b) encourage people with permitted encroachments to remove them; c) require unpermitted encroachments to be permitted and removed; and d) discourage private use permit applications; and

 WHEREAS, the City Council finds that it is in the public interest to classify shoreline street end permits as a separate category of street use permits, and that it is appropriate to add to the Street Use Permit Fee Schedule a new fee to be collected from private shoreline street end permittees, and to direct the proceeds of said fees to Seattle Transportation for administration and management of shoreline street ends; NOW, THEREFORE,

 BE IT ORDAINED BY THE CITY OF SEATTLE AS FOLLOWS:

 Section 1. The Street Use Fee Permit Schedule attached to Ordinance 119260 and made a part thereof is hereby amended to clarify the description of Category 7, to add a new category 11 for use of shoreline street ends, to prescribe a fee for such use based on appropriate appraisal methodology, and to add public street end uses to Category 54, as follows:

Fees for use of shoreline street ends may take into consideration City policy of discouraging encroachments inconsistent with the public right of access to shorelines and may be included in the schedule of fees for use of public places under the jurisdiction of Seattle Transportation.  Fees for use of park drives and boulevards may take into consideration City policy of discouraging encroachments inconsistent with their park-like character and may be included in the schedule of fees for use of facilities of the Department of Parks and Recreation.

 b) Administration and inspection of shoreline street end use;

 c) Verification of property boundaries and square feet of area of usage;

 d) Matching funds for neighborhood improvements of shoreline street ends for public use;

 e) Signage, demarcation and maintenance of shoreline street ends;

 f) City-funded street and sidewalk improvements within a half-block radius of any of the 149 shoreline street ends identified in this legislation that directly contribute to public access to the shoreline street end.

 Section 6. Seattle Transportation is further directed to draft and implement a plan for enforcing the requirement of SMC 15.04.010 for use and occupation permit on shoreline street ends; providing notification to owners of property abutting shoreline street ends of the increased fee and the fee calculation methodology; and providing public education as to the policy preferences for public access uses of shoreline street ends, as set forth in Resolution 29370, and of means whereby a permittee can reduce the amount of the fee by reducing the amount of private encroachment onto the street end and/or contributing to the maintenance of public access improvements on the street end. Any permits granted shall clearly establish the dates, or circumstances (i.e., property sale) for the removal of encroachments. The Director shall also establish policies requiring liens to be filed against the property owners, should the City be forced to remove any encroachments. During the third quarter of 2000, Seattle Transportation shall report back to the Transportation Committee on its progress implementing the new fee schedule and providing public education or relief to permit applicants seeking to reduce their fees.

 This report shall include a comprehensive review of both the costs and revenues of the program and itemize the improvements made to shoreline streetends.

 Section 7. This ordinance shall take effect and be in force thirty (30) days from and after its approval by the Mayor, but if not approved and returned by the Mayor within ten (10) days after presentation, it shall take effect as provided by Municipal Code Section 1.04.020.
