 WHEREAS, increases in the City's drainage and wastewater rates are necessary to cover inflationary costs, an increase in debt service costs resulting from the 1998 drainage and wastewater revenue bond issue, continued capital improvement needs, programmatic initiatives; and

 WHEREAS, The City may approve an additional rate increase for the year 2000 to cover any King County treatment charge increases and associated taxes; and
