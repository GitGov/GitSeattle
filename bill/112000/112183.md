 25.02.010 Title.

 This chapter shall be known and may be cited as the "Seattle Commute Trip Reduction Ordinance." (Ord. 116657 1(part), 1993.)

 25.02.020 Purpose.

 The purpose of this chapter is to implement the Washington State Clean Air Act, RCW 70.94.521 through 70.94.551. (Ord. 116657 1(part), 1993.)

 25.02.030 Definitions.

 For the purposes of this chapter the following works or phrases are defined as described below.

 A. "Affected Employee" means a full-time employee who begins his or her regular work day at a single worksite between six a.m. (6:00 a.m.) and nine a.m. (9:00 a.m.) (inclusive) on two (2) or more weekdays.

 B. "Affected employer" means a private or public employer that for twelve (12) continuous months employs one hundred (100) or more full-time employees at a single worksite who are scheduled to begin their regular workday between six a.m. (6:00 a.m.) and nine a.m. (9:00 a.m.) (inclusive) on two (2) or more weekdays, even if the identity of the employees varies over time. This is equivalent to the term "major employer" used in RCW 70.94.521 through 70.94.551.

 C. "Alternative mode" means a method of commuting to work other than a single-occupant motor vehicle being the dominant mode, and may include telecommuting and compressed workweeks if those methods result in fewer commute trips.

 D. "Base year" means the calendar year from January 1, 1992 through December 31, 1992. Goals for vehicle miles traveled (VMT) per employee and proportion of single-occupant vehicle trips (SOV) are based upon VMT and SOVs established in that year for the CTR zone.

 E. "Commute trips" means trips made from an employee's residence to a worksite for a regularly scheduled workday beginning between six a.m. (6:00 a.m.) and nine a.m. (9:00 a.m.) (inclusive).

 F. "CTR plan" means Seattle's commute trip reduction plan as set forth in this chapter.

 G. "CTR program" means an employer's strategy to reduce affected employee's SOV use and VMT per employee.

 H. "CTR zone" means an area, such as a census tract or combination of census tracts within Seattle, characterized by similar employment density, population density, level of transit service, parking availability, access to high-occupancy vehicle facilities, and other factors that affect the level of SOV commuting. One of the six (6) areas shown on Attachment A.1

 I. "Director" means the Director of Transportation.

 J. "Dominant mode" means the mode of travel used for the greatest distance of a commute trip.

 K. "Employee" means any person who works for an employer in return for financial or other compensation, and whose workload and schedule is subject to the control of the employer. Employee does not include independent contractors.

 L. "Equivalent survey information" means information that substitutes for the Washington State Department of Transportation goal measurement survey, as determined by the City.

 M. "Full-time employee" means an employee, scheduled to be employed on a continuous basis for fifty-two (52) weeks for an average of at least thirty-five (35) hours per week.

 N. "Mode" means the type of transportation used by employees, such as single-occupant vehicle, rideshare, bicycle, walk, ferry, and transit.

 O. "Proportion of SOV trips" or "SOV rate" means the number of commute trips in the survey week made by affected employees in SOVs, minus any adjustments for telecommuting, bicycling, walking or compressed work schedules, divided by the total number of affected employee workdays during the survey week. An "affected employee workday" includes any day that an employee does not work due to a compressed work schedule.

 P. "Single-occupant vehicle (SOV)" means a motor vehicle occupied by one (1) employee for commute purposes, excluding motorcycles.

 Q. "Vehicle miles traveled (VMT) per employee" means the average commute trip length, in miles, made by affected employees over a set period, multiplied by the number of vehicle commute trips per affected employee during that period.

 R. "Worksite" means a building or group of buildings on physically contiguous parcels of land or on parcels separated solely by private or public roadways or rights-of-way. Construction worksites, when the expected duration of the construction project is less than two (2) years, are excluded.

 S. "Writing," "written" or "in writing" means original signed and dated documents. Facsimile (fax) transmissions are a temporary notice of action that must be followed by the original signed and dated document via mail or delivery.

 T. "Good Faith Effort" means that an employer has met the minimum requirements identified in RCW 70.94.531 and this chapter, and is working collaboratively with the City to continue its existing CTR program or is developing and implementing program modifications likely to result in improvements to its CTR program over an agreed upon length of time.

 1. Editor's Note: Attachment A is on file with Ordinance 116657 in the City Clerk's office.

 25.02.040 Employer's commute trip reduction program.

 A. Program Submittal and Implementation.

 1. Application: a. This chapter applies to any affected employer at any worksite within The City of Seattle. An affected employer must submit a CTR program to the Director within one hundred eighty (180) days of June 4, 1993, the effective date of the ordinance codified in this chapter, regardless of whether the employer has received notice from the City that this chapter applies to the employer. The purpose of an employer CTR program is to help achieve the goals set forth in Section 25.02.060. b. An employer that becomes an "affected employer" after adoption of the ordinance codified in this chapter shall develop and submit its initial CTR program to the Director within one hundred eighty (180) days of the first Washington State Department of Employment Security's Employer's Quarterly Report of Employee's Wages published after becoming an affected employer. c. An affected employer is required to make a good faith effort, as defined in RCW 70.94.534(2) and this chapter, to develop and implement a CTR program that will encourage its employees to reduce VMT per employee and SOV commute trips. d. An affected employer shall implement its approved CTR program within one hundred eighty (180) days after the initial program is submitted to the Director. Implementation is accomplished by carrying out all of the program measures contained in an employer's CTR program.

 2. Transportation Management Associations. a. In lieu of submitting an initial CTR program and annual report as described in Section 25.02.050, an affected employer may join a transportation management association ("TMA") or other organization that submits a single program or annual report on behalf of its members. In addition to describing program measures which are common to its members, the TMAs CTR program and annual report shall describe specific program measures which are unique to individual members' worksites. The TMA, as an agent for its members, shall provide performance data for each worksite, as well as data aggregated from all TMA members, to the Director. A TMA is subject to the same time-period requirements as any single employer. b. Each employer is responsible for meeting the requirements of this chapter regardless of the employer's participation in a TMA. Program modifications shall be specific to an employer. If an employer elects to satisfy its CTR program requirements through a TMA program or annual report, the employer shall notify the Director in writing, designating the TMA as its agent.

 B. Program Content. Each employer CTR program shall include the following elements:

 1. Designation of Employee Transportation Coordinator. The employer shall designate a transportation coordinator to administer CTR program and act as liaison with the Director. An affected employer with multiple worksites may have one (1) transportation coordinator for all sites. The coordinator's and/or designee's name, location and telephone number must be displayed prominently at each affected work site2. Distribution of Information. The employer shall provide a complete description of its CTR program to employees at least twice a year and to each new employee when he or she begins his or her employment. Each employer's program description and annual report must report the information to be regularly distributed and the method and frequency of distribution;

 3. CTR Program Measures. An employer's initial CTR program shall include at least two (2) of the following measures: a. Provide bicycle parking facilities and/or lockers, changing areas, and showers for employees who walk or bicycle to work, b. Provide commuter ride-matching services to facilitate employee ride-sharing for commute trips, c. Provide subsidies for transit fares, d. Provide employer vans or third-party vans for vanpooling, e. Provide subsidy for carpool and vanpool participation, f. Permit the use of the employer's vehicles for carpool and/or vanpool commute trips, g. Permit alternative work schedules such as a compressed work week that reduce commute trips by affected employees between six a.m. (6:00 a.m.) and nine a.m. (9:00 a.m.). A compressed workweek regularly allows a full-time employee to eliminate at least one workday every two (2) weeks, by working longer hours during the remaining days, resulting in fewer commute trips by the employee, h. Permit Alternative work schedules such as flex-time that reduce commute trips by affected employees between six a.m. (6:00 a.m.) and nine a.m. (9:00 a.m.). Flex-time allows individual employees some flexibility in choosing the time, but not the number, of their working hours, i. Provide preferential parking for high-occupancy vehicles, j. Provide reduced parking charges for high-occupancy vehicles, k. Cooperate with transportation providers to provide additional regular or express service to the work site (e.g., a custom bus service arranged specifically to transport employees to work), l. Construct special loading and unloading facilities for transit, carpool and/or vanpool users, m. Provide and fund a program of parking incentives such as a cash payment for employees who do not use the parking facilities, n. Institute or increase parking charges for SOVs, o. Establish a program to permit employees to telecommute either part- or full-time, where telecommuting is an arrangement that permits an employee to work from home, eliminating a commute trip, or to work from a work center closer to home, reducing the distance traveled in a commute trip by at least half, p. Provide a shuttle between the employer's worksite and the closest park-and-ride lot, transit center, or principal transit street, q. Implement other measures designed and demonstrated to facilitate the use of non-SOV commute modes, which are agreed upon between the Director and the employer;

 4. A description of any additional program measures included in the employer's CTR program;

 5. Assignment of responsibilities for implementing the CTR program, evidence of commitment to provide appropriate resources to carry out the CTR program, and a schedule of implementation; and

 6. Description of employer's CTR worksite characteristics. The employer program must include: a. A general description of the affected employer worksite, b. A general description of the availability of transportation to the worksite, c. The total number of employees and affected employees at the worksite, d. Site or operational conditions which may affect an employee's choice of commute mode;

 7. Record-keeping. The CTR program shall include a list of the records to be maintained by the employer in implementing the program. Employers will maintain all records listed in their CTR program for twenty-four (24) months.

 C. Program Review and Approval.

 1. a. The Director shall review each employer's initial CTR program to determine if it has met the minimum requirements of this CTR chapter. b. The Director shall complete review of each employer's initial CTR program and annual reports within ninety (90) days of the date the employer submits the program or report to the Director, and notify the employer in writing whether or not the program or report has been approved, and the reasons for approval or disapproval.

 2. No later than thirty (30) days before the initial CTR program description or annual report is to be submitted, an employer may request a thirty (30) day extension to submit that document. An extension shall be granted and shall not exceed thirty (30) days.

 3. Beginning in 1995, the Director shall review each employer's annual report to determine the employer's progress toward achieving its SOV and VMT goals.

 a. If an employer makes a good faith effort as defined in RCW 70.94.534(2) and this chapter and meets either or both goals for SOV and VMT, the employer has satisfied the objectives of the CTR plan and will not be required to modify the CTR program. The Director shall issue a decision approving an employer's CTR program.

 Section 2. This ordinance shall take effect and be in force thirty (30) days from and after its approval by the Mayor, but if not approved and returned by the Mayor within ten (10) days after presentation, it shall take effect as provided by Municipal Code Section 1.04.020.
