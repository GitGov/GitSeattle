 WHEREAS, by Ordinance 114029, as amended, the City has established a "TDR Bank" and authorized the Director of Housing and Human Services ("DHHS Director") to negotiate the purchase of transferable development rights ("TDRs") from such low-income housing and certain landmark performing arts theaters to aid in the preservation of low- income housing and landmark performing arts theaters; and

 WHEREAS, by Ordinance 117342 the City established a Development Rights Fund (redesignated as a subfund in Ordinance 117977) for the purchase of development rights from landmark performing arts theaters, in order to aid in their preservation; and

 WHEREAS, the developer of a proposed low-income housing project has offered to sell TDRs in accordance with the City's Land Use Code and another low-income housing project has applied for TDR Bank funding; and

 WHEREAS, funds are available in the Development Rights Subfund as a result of selling TDRs to the developer of the Starwood Hotel; and

 WHEREAS, there is an immediate need for additional funds for downtown low-income housing beyond the amounts appropriated in the 1998 Adopted Budget; Now, Therefore,

 BE IT ORDAINED BY THE CITY OF SEATTLE AS FOLLOWS:

 Section 1. The DHHS Director is authorized, for and on behalf of The City of Seattle, to execute, deliver, perform, administer and enforce an agreement (the "Agreement") for the purchase of up to Thirty-Three Thousand Five Hundred and Eight square feet (33,508 s.f.) of TDRs for a price not to exceed $13.02 per square foot (a total purchase price not to exceed Four Hundred Thirty-Six Thousand Two Hundred and Seventy-Four Dollars ($436,274)), with such additional terms and conditions as the DHHS Director shall deem necessary or appropriate to carry out the intent of this Ordinance. The TDRs shall be acquired from the property known as the Fleming Apartments located at 2321 Fourth Avenue in Seattle (the "Project"), legally described as follows:

 Lot 9, Block 36, Second Addition to that part of the City of Seattle, as laid off by A. A. Denny and W. N. Bell (commonly known a Bell and Denny's 2nd addition to the City of Seattle), according to the plat thereof recorded in Volume 1 of Plats, page 77, Records of King County, Washington; Except the Northeasterly 12 feet thereof condemned for widening 4th Avenue in King County Superior Court Cause No. 52280 under Ordinance No. 13776, of the City of Seattle.

 Section 2. Purchase of any amount of the TDRs from the Project is conditioned upon the Agreement including a commitment approved by the DHHS Director to provide low-income housing for a minimum of twenty (20) years, consistent with the City's Land Use Code and Director's Rule 20-93 published by the Seattle Department of Construction and Land Use. The Project will provide 36 low-income rental housing units affordable to households at or below fifty percent (50%) of median area income.

 Section 3. The DHHS Director is further authorized, for and on behalf of the City, to accept and record a statutory warranty deed to the TDRs to be purchased and to execute, deliver, modify, administer

 and enforce such other agreements and documents as may be reasonably necessary to carry out the intent of this Ordinance.

 Section 4. In order to pay for TDRs from the Project and any future authorized projects, the expenditure authority in the 1998 Budget of DHHS is hereby increased by the amount of Five Hundred Eighteen Thousand One Hundred Thirty-Five Dollars ($518,135), by the appropriation and transfer, hereby made and authorized, of Five Hundred Eighteen Thousand One Hundred and Thirty-Five Dollars ($518,135) from the Development Rights Subfund to the TDR/Mitigation Subfund of the Low-Income Housing Fund. Funds for the purchase of the TDRs from the Project as authorized in Section 1 shall be paid from amounts appropriated in the TDR/Mitigation Subfund of the Low-Income Housing Fund in the 1998 Adopted Budget as revised by this ordinance.

 Section 5. In order to facilitate the redevelopment of the Project, the DHHS Director is authorized, consistent with the Agreement, to cause the disbursement of funds in payment of the purchase price of the TDRs from the Fleming Apartments prior to the time that the Project meets all of the conditions to the transfer of TDRs under the Land Use Code, provided that there is reasonable assurance that such requirements will be satisfied. Such disbursement may be made in the form of an advance payment or as an interest-free bridge loan to be discharged by delivery of the deed to the TDRs when all conditions are satisfied, as the DHHS Director shall determine.

 Section 6. Any actions pursuant to the authority of this Ordinance and prior to its effective date are hereby ratified and confirmed.

 Section 7. The foregoing appropriation is made to meet actual necessary expenditures of the City for which insufficient appropriations have been made due to causes which could not reasonably
