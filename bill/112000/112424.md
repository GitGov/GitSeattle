 WHEREAS, $15.00 is the approximate cost of serving a typical passenger car disposing of refuse at City Recycling and Disposal Stations; and

 WHEREAS, there is not a sufficient number of scales at City Recycling and Disposal Stations to weigh all vehicles in and out to determine the exact weight of each load without significantly increasing queues;
