The Plan Committee which has the power to administer the Plan under the Plan and Trust Document is authorized to adopt future amendments to the Plan and Trust Document as may be in the best interests of the Participants, so long as such amendments do not require or increase City contributions to the Plan and are within the Committee's powers as set forth in the Plan and Trust Document.

 Section 2. The City hereby establishes a Trust effective January 1, 1999 with the Trustees pursuant to the Plan and Trust Document, which shall be comprised of all assets under the Plan, including all sums of money, all deferred amounts, all property and rights purchased with deferred amounts, and all means attributed to such amounts, property or rights currently held by the City as follows: all assets invested through the Recordkeeping and Administrative Services Agreement executed between the City and Fidelity Investments Public Sector Services Company on December 20, 1996, all assets invested with the Seattle Metropolitan Credit Union, all assets invested with Nationwide Life Insurance Company, all assets invested with Great-West Life and Annuity Insurance Company, and the contractual rights associated with these assets, all other assets of the Plan owned by the City as of the effective date of the trust, and such amounts as shall from time to time be paid or delivered to the Plan's Trustees by the City and the earnings and profits thereon. All such money and property, all investments and proceeds thereof and earnings and appreciations thereon are referred to herein as the "Trust Fund".
