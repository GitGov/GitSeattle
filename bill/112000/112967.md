 PRELIMINARY REPORT

 EVALUATION OF REUSE & DISPOSAL OPTIONS FOR

 PM# 230325-1-301 GREGORY HEIGHTS SUBSTATION

 Resolution 29799 directs the Executive to make its recommendations on the reuse or disposal of excess property on a case by case basis, using the Procedures for Evaluation of the Reuse and Disposal of the City's Real Property adopted by that resolution. Additionally, the Resolution identifies guidelines, which are to be considered in making a recommendation. This report addresses each of the guidelines outlined in Resolution 29799 in support of the recommendation.

 Property Management Area: PM # 230325-1-301 GREGORY HEIGHTS SUBSTATION

 BACKGROUND INFORMATION

 Legal Description: The East 100 feet of the West 130 feet of the North 45 feet of the South 1/2 of the West 1/2 of the South 1/2 of the Southeast 1/4 of the Northeast 1/4 of the Northeast 1/4 of Section 25, Township 23 North, Range 3 East of W.M., in King County, Washington

 Physical Description and Related Factors: The site is essentially level and rectangular in shape. The lot area is 4,500 square feet. The property is located directly off 19th Ave. S.W., north of S.W. 164th St. There is no known critical areas at the site.

 GUIDELINE A: CONSISTENCY

 The analysis should consider the purpose for which the property was originally acquired, funding sources used to acquire the property, terms and conditions of original acquisition, the title or deed conveying the property, or any other contract or instrument by which the City is bound or to which the property is subject, and City, state or federal ordinances, statues and regulations.

 The property was acquired with Light Fund monies under three transactions in March 1953, for use as a network distribution station. Washington State Law requires that utility funds receive fair market value for disposals of surplus real property.

 Guideline B: Compatibility and Suitability

 The recommendation should reflect an assessment of the potential for use of the property in support of adopted Neighborhood Plans, as or in support of low-income housing, in support of economic development, in support of affordable housing, for park or open space; in support of Sound Transit Link Light Rail station area development; as or in support of child care facilities, and in support of other priorities reflected in adopted City policies.

 Context. The property is located within the City of Burien. As such, it is not particularly suited to meet specific City of Seattle needs. The City of Burien, the Highline School District and King County did not express any interest in the property. The property is not located near the Sound Transit alignment.

 Range of Options. Options include sale by public bid, negotiated sale, long-term ground lease, or retention by the City. Given that no City department has identified any current or future use for the property, and given the location of the property outside the limits of the City of Seattle, neither the long-term ground lease or retention of the property are in the best interests of the City. There are no parties of record interested in acquiring the property, and no particular benefit to the City from offering the property only to an abutting owner; therefore, sale by public bid is in the best interest of the City.

 Guideline C: Other Factors

 The recommendation should consider the highest and best use of the property, compatibility of the proposed use with the physical characteristics of the property and with surrounding uses,

 timing and term of the proposed use, appropriateness of the consideration to be received, unique attributes that make the property hard to replace, potential for consolidation with adjacent public property to accomplish future goals and objectives, conditions in the real estate market, and known environmental factors that make affect the value of the property.

 Highest and Best Use: An appraisal report has been received and reviewed for the property. The highest and best use is as single- family housing, based on the zoning and the lot size. The site square footage is 4,500 square feet. While zoning is RS-7200, it is possible to develop this site with one single-family residence. The appraised value of the property has been determined to be $64,000.

 Compatibility with surrounding uses: The most likely use of the property is for single-family housing, which will be compatible with the surrounding neighborhood.

 Potential for Consolidation with adjacent public property: There is no other City of Seattle property located in this vicinity. The property is located within the same block as Gregory Heights Elementary School; however, the Highline School District did not have an interest in acquiring the property.

 Timing and Term of Proposed Use: No specific use is proposed. The property will be offered for sale by public bid, with the likely purchaser constructing single-family housing.

 Appropriateness of the consideration: The property would be offered for sale by public bid to the highest bidder. The legislation would authorize SCL to accept a minimum bid within 10% of the appraised fair market value.

 Known environmental factors: SCL hired a consultant to perform environmental assessments at this and eleven other substations. The consultant's report for this property has not been made available to the City. There is no known clean-up or other remedial treatment indicated for the Gregory Heights Substation as of September 21, 1999.

 Guideline D Sale

 The recommendation should evaluate the potential for selling the property to non-City public entities and to members of the general public.

 Neither SCL nor ESD have file records of any interest in obtaining this property from any party. Sale by public bid will provide a fair and equitable process for identifying a purchaser for the site. Notice of the public bid process will be sent to owners and occupants in the immediate neighborhood.

 RECOMMENDATION

 The Real Estate Oversight Committee recommends that the property be offered for sale by public bid in a manner to be selected by the City Light Superintendent.
