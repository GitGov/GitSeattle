 AN ORDINANCE relating to low-income housing, approving the 1999-2000 Administrative and Financial Plan for 1995 Housing Levy Programs established under Ordinance 117711 and for the Operating and Maintenance Trust Fund established under the 1986 Housing Levy.

 WHEREAS, pursuant to Ordinance 117711, as amended, the voters of The City of Seattle approved the levy of property taxes for the purpose of financing low-income housing, including housing for very low-income households under RCW 84.52.105; and

 WHEREAS, Ordinance 117711 and the Affordable Housing Financing Plan provide for periodic submission to the City Council of an Administrative and Financial Plan for programs funded by the 1995 Housing Levy ("Levy Programs"); and

 WHEREAS, the Department of Housing and Human Services, in conjunction with the Housing Levy Oversight Committee, has developed the Administrative and Financial Plan for 1999-2000; and

 WHEREAS, pursuant to Ordinance 112904, the voters of Seattle approved the 1986 Housing Levy, which included an Operating and Maintenance Trust Fund program ("1986 Trust Fund") to provide for long-term affordability of extremely low-income housing developed under with 1986 Housing Levy funds; and

 WHEREAS, by Ordinance 119060 the City Council authorized an amendment to the Cooperation Agreement between The City of Seattle and the Housing Authority of the City of Seattle ("SHA") by which the administration of the 1986 Trust Fund has been consolidated, in the City Department of Housing and Human Services ("DHHS"), with the administration of the Operating and Maintenance Trust Fund funded by the 1995 Housing Levy ("1995 Trust Fund"), and the City Council directed that the next Administrative and Financial Plan for the 1995 Housing Levy include the Administrative and Financial Plan for the 1986 Trust Fund; and

 WHEREAS, DHHS has consulted with affected project sponsors and has recommended that policies governing the 1986 Trust Fund be merged with policies governing the 1995 Trust Fund, with certain exceptions; and

 WHEREAS, the Housing Levy Oversight Committee voted at its meeting on August 4, 1998, to recommend approval of the Administrative and Financial Plan for 1999-2000; NOW, THEREFORE,

 BE IT ORDAINED BY THE CITY OF SEATTLE AS FOLLOWS:

 Section 1. The City Council hereby approves the 1995 Seattle Housing Levy Administrative and Financial Plan for Program Years 1999-2000 attached to this Ordinance as Exhibit A (the "Plan"). The policies contained in Section III of the part of the Plan entitled "Operating and Maintenance Trust Fund Program" also shall serve as policies for the 1986 Trust Fund, except (a) as otherwise provided in that Section; and (b) to the extent any such policies may be contrary to the terms of the Cooperation Agreement with SHA authorized by Ordinance 113562, as amended pursuant to Ordinance 119060, or to the terms of any agreement between the City and SHA hereafter executed pursuant to the Cooperation Agreement to govern 1986 Trust Fund subsidies to SHA projects.

 Section 2. The City Council hereby finds that in order to promote the efficient, cost-effective and responsible administration, approximately five percent (5%) of total levy funding should be authorized for administration of the 1995 Housing Levy programs. Ordinance 117711 and Resolution 21965 automatically allow the Department of Housing and Human Services sixty percent (60%) of the amount allocated for administration (or approximately three percent (3%) of the five percent (5%)), but require express authority to authorize the remaining forty percent (40%) (or approximately (2%) of the five percent (5%)). The Council finds that it is appropriate to authorize the expenditure through December 31, 2000, of the remaining forty percent (40%) of funds allocated in Ordinance 117711 for the administration of Housing Levy Programs. Therefore, the City Council authorizes the expenditure through December 31, 2000, of the full amount allocated to administration of Housing Levy programs in Ordinance 117711, subject to appropriation of such funds.

 Section 3. The DHHS Director is authorized, in her discretion, and with the agreement of the affected project sponsor, to apply Rental Housing Production Program policies set forth in the attached Plan to any housing project to which 1995 Housing Levy funds have previously been allocated, or to which such funds shall be allocated prior to 1999.

 Section 4. This Ordinance shall take effect and be in force thirty (30) days from and after its approval by the Mayor, but if not approved and returned by the Mayor within ten (10) days after presentation, it shall take effect as provided by Municipal Code Section 1.04.020.
