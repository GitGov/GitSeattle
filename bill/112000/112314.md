 ORDINANCE _________________

 WHEREAS, on February 12, 1996, the City Council passed Ordinance 118011, authorizing the City to lease or otherwise acquire a parking garage (the "Garage") located on property bounded by Sixth and Seventh Avenues and Pine and Olive Streets (commonly known as the "Systems Block") and located beneath the retail and entertainment complex commonly known as "Pacific Place", and authorizing the Mayor to sign an "Umbrella Agreement" and a "Parking Agreement" substantially in the forms attached thereto; and

 WHEREAS, the City has entered into the Umbrella Agreement and Parking Agreement authorized by Ordinance 118011; and

 WHEREAS, on October 21, 1996, the City Council passed Ordinance 118348, authorizing the Mayor to sign an amendment to the Umbrella Agreement, and the City has entered into that amendment; and

 WHEREAS, on May 26, 1998, the City Council passed Ordinance 119013 authorizing the Mayor to sign an amendment to the Parking Agreement, and the City has entered into that amendment; and

 WHEREAS, on October 21, 1996, the City Council passed Ordinance 118349, authorizing a Condominium Declaration to divide the property on the Systems Block, now known as Pacific Place, into a "Garage Unit" and a "Retail Unit"; and

 WHEREAS, the Umbrella Agreement, as amended, requires the City to lease or otherwise acquire the Garage when certain conditions are met, including having the Garage open to the public for parking for six months, having a major national retailer open in the former Frederick & Nelson Building for at least two months, having all of the public spaces and at least 150,000 square feet of gross leasable area in the Retail Unit of Pacific Place open for business, and certifying that the marketing and training program for the "pay on foot" aspect of Garage operations has been completed for at least one month; and

 WHEREAS, the Garage opened to the public on May 23, 1998; and

 WHEREAS, Nordstrom opened its new flagship store in the former Frederick & Nelson Building on August 21, 1998; and

 WHEREAS, it appears that Pine Street Development will open all public spaces and at least 150,000 square feet of gross leasable area in the Retail Unit of Pacific Place during October 1998, and will complete the marketing and training program for the "pay on foot" Garage by mid-October 1998; and

 WHEREAS, it therefore appears likely that the City will be required to lease or otherwise acquire the Garage in November 1998, Now Therefore,

 Section 1. To pay the costs associated with operation of the parking garage located between Sixth and Seventh Avenues and Pine and Olive Streets beneath the Pacific Place retail complex in downtown Seattle (the "Garage") in 1998, the sum of Five Hundred Thousand Dollars ($500,000), or as much thereof as may be necessary, is hereby appropriated from the Parking Garage Operations Fund.

 Section 2. Any acts consistent with the authority but prior to the effective date of this ordinance are hereby ratified and confirmed.

 Section 3. The foregoing appropriation is made to meet actual necessary expenditures of the City for which insufficient appropriations have been made due to causes that could not reasonably have been foreseen at the time of the adoption of the 1998 Budget; Now, Therefore, in accordance with RCW 35.32A.060, by reason of the facts above stated, this ordinance shall take effect and be in force thirty (30) days from and after its approval by the Mayor, but if not approved and returned by the Mayor within ten (10) days after presentation, it shall take effect as provided by Municipal Code Section 1.04.020.
