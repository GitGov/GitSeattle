The six hundred nominal fee and discount memberships or non-membership access privileges will be made available by the YMCA each year for twenty (20) years. Eligible beneficiaries will be individuals with individual or family incomes at or less than fifty per cent (50%) of the median income for the Seattle-Bellevue-Everett area, adjusted for household size.
