 AN ORDINANCE making an appropriation from the Emergency Subfund for the Elevated Transportation Company to provide funds for basic administrative costs for its first year of operation; and increasing the 1998 expenditure allowance in the City budget; all by a three-fourths vote of the City Council.

 WHEREAS, the voters of the City of Seattle, Washington ("City"), approved Initiative No. 41 (the Monorail Initiative) on November 4, 1997, creating the Elevated Transportation Company (ETC) whose purpose is "to cause a transportation system to be built that will be principally an elevated mass transportation system which will be electrically powered, with rubber tires"; and

 WHEREAS, the ETC, according to the initiative, will be a separate public corporation that will oversee and operate the system, and all other facilities directly related to the elevated transportation system; and

 WHEREAS, the ETC will be a public corporation with a governing council comprised of 12 members, and will be vested with the corporate powers of a public corporation to exercise, conduct, and control its affairs consistent with city, state, and federal law, with the ETC's charter, and with its organizational mission; and

 WHEREAS, the initiative creating the ETC did not provide funding for the ETC's estimated basic administrative costs; and

 WHEREAS, the Interim Committee for the Monorail Initiative has recommended to the City Council that, although the primary source of funding for the ETC should be private funds, the City should provide basic administrative funding for the ETC for the first year in order to assist in the ETC's initial development; and

 WHEREAS state law provides, in RCW 35.21.730(1), that a city may transfer funds, property, and services to a public corporation such as the ETC, with or without consideration; and

 WHEREAS, the City Council has determined that making funding available for a portion of the ETC's estimated basic administrative costs will facilitate the ETC's ability to fulfill its purpose, which is declared to be a public purpose of the City; NOW, THEREFORE,

 BE IT ORDAINED BY THE CITY OF SEATTLE AS FOLLOWS:

 Section 1. To make available funding for a portion of the estimated basic administrative costs of the Elevated Transportation Company (ETC) for the first year of its operation, for one year beginning February 17, 1998, the sum of Two Hundred Thousand Dollars ($200,000) or so much thereof as may be necessary is hereby appropriated from the Supplemental Appropriation Account of the Emergency Subfund. The 1998 budget of Seattle Transportation is increased by a like amount, which the Director of said department shall transfer to the ETC in accordance with an agreement which the Director is hereby directed and authorized to enter into with the ETC. The agreement shall specify the level of funding to be provided to the ETC by the City of Seattle ("City") to pay for the estimated basic administrative costs, and products related thereto, of the ETC for the first year of its operation, and this level shall be determined by the Director based upon his or her review of the quarterly operating budget which the ETC's governing council is required to adopt under the provisions of Initiative 41. The agreement shall limit the use of funds to those basic administrative costs proposed in advance by the ETC and approved by the Director of Seattle Transportation. If under the agreement moneys are transferred to the ETC prior to their use, the agreement shall call for the return to the City of amounts not used for such basic administrative costs by February 17, 1999. The agreement shall also require an accounting to the City by the ETC of the ETC's expenditure of these funds.

 Section 2. The foregoing appropriation is made to meet actual necessary expenditures of the City for which insufficient appropriations have been made due to causes that could not reasonably have been foreseen at the time of the adoption of the 1998 budget.

 Section 3. Now, therefore, in accordance with RCW 35.32A.060, by reason of the facts above stated, this ordinance shall take effect and be in force thirty (30) days from and after its approval by the Mayor, but if not approved and returned by the Mayor within ten (10) days after presentation, it shall take effect as provided by Municipal Code Section 1.04.020.
