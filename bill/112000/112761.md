 Tshh ORDINANCE ______

 AN ORDINANCE relating to Seattle Public Utilities; authorizing the execution of a purchase and sale agreement with The Trust for Public Land for sale of certain City property located in Chelan County, Washington; ratifying and confirming certain authority granted by Ordinance 116839 and Resolution 29657 with respect to sale of said property; and authorizing the conveyance of said property, execution of closing documents, and acceptance and deposit of funds in connection with the sale.

 WHEREAS, in 1970, the City acquired approximately 556 acres of pastureland and timberland known as the Eagle Creek Ranch in Chelan County, Washington, for purposes of exchange with the United States Forest Service for its lands within the Cedar River Watershed; and

 WHEREAS, the City's inventory of properties acquired for this purpose eventually grew to more than 17,500 acres within the boundaries of four National Forests in eleven counties of the state; and

 WHEREAS, in 1992, Congress passed and the President signed the Cedar River Watershed Land Exchange Act (Public Law 102-453) directing the Forest Service, upon agreement of the City, to complete the exchange under appraisal methods, deed restrictions, and other requirements set forth in the legislation; and

 WHEREAS, in 1993, in preparation for the exchange, Ordinance 116839, Section 3, found and declared all of the City's exchange properties (collectively referred to as "City Lands" in P.L. 102-453), including the Eagle Creek Ranch, to be surplus to the City's needs and not required for water utility service; and

 WHEREAS, Ordinance 116839, Section 5, also granted authority for competitive or negotiated sale of any City Lands in excess of those required to complete the exchange, provided that the City Council adopts a resolution endorsing a list of properties eligible for disposition; and

 WHEREAS, in 1996, the City and the Forest Service closed the planned land exchange under terms of Public Law 102-453 with the City retaining more than 3,200 acres of its City Lands; and

 WHEREAS, in 1997, Resolution 29657 declared a list of all City Lands in excess of those required to complete the exchange, including the Eagle Creek Ranch, to be eligible for disposition for purposes of activating the sale authority granted by Ordinance 116839, provided, however, that the final terms of any competitive or negotiated sale and the dedication of net proceeds are subject to approval by the City Council; and

 WHEREAS, in 1998, Ordinance 118972 authorized the sale of the Eagle Creek Ranch to The Trust for Public Land (for reconveyance to the Forest Service) under terms set forth in a purchase and sale agreement, including a financing contingency provision; and

 WHEREAS, The Trust for Public Land was unable to secure financing prior to the end of specified financing contingency period and the purchase and sale agreement expired; and

 WHEREAS, representatives of Seattle Public Utilities and The Trust for Public Land have negotiated changes in the sale terms in order to increase the likelihood of obtaining financing and have prepared a new purchase and sale agreement for approval by the City Council as required by Resolution 29657; NOW, THEREFORE,

 BE IT ORDAINED BY THE CITY OF SEATTLE AS FOLLOWS:
