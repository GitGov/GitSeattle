 C. Hazardous Material Related Permits. Fees for hazardous material related permits are established in Schedule C (See Table 22.602.040 C). In some cases these fees are based on the quantity of hazardous material stored and/or handled at the site and the relative risk posed by each material.

 1. Definitions:

 a. "Quantity Range Number" as established in the Quantity Range Table below, is a number between 1 and 2 which is assigned to a hazard category based upon the amount of hazardous material located at the site.

 QUANTITY RANGE TABLE

 QUANTITY SOLIDS LIQUIDS GASES RANGE (Pounds) (Gallons) (Cu. Ft.) NUMBER

 1 0-550 0-55 0-1,000 1.25 >550 - 5,500 >55 - 550 >1,000 - 5,000 1.5 >5,500 - 27,500 >550 - 2,750 >5,000 - 50,000 1.75 >27,500 - 55,000 >2,750 - 5,500 >50,000 - 100,000 2 >55,000 >5,500 >100,000

 b. "Assigned Risk Factor" as established below, is a number assigned to each hazard class and category of hazardous material indicating the relative hazard posed by materials in that hazard category.

 Hazard Category Assigned Hazard Assigned Risk Category Risk Factor Factor

 Aerosol products 1.3 Liquid petroleum gas 1.4 Cellulose nitrate 1.3 Magnesium 1.3 Combustible fiber 1.2 Organic peroxides Combustible liquids Unclassified 1.5 Class II 1.2 Class I 1.4 Class III-A 1.1 Class II 1.3 Class III-B 1.1 Class III 1.2 Compressed gases Class IV 1.1 Highly toxic 1.5 Oxidizers Pyrophoric 1.4 Class 4 1.5 Flammable 1.4 Class 3 1.4 Unstable 1.4  Class 2 1.3 Oxidizing 1.4 Class 1 1.2 Toxic 1.3 Pyrophoric liquids 1.3 Cryogenic 1.3 Radioactives 1.4 Corrosive 1.3 Toxic liquids/solids 1.2 Corrosives 1.1 Unstable (reactive) liquids/solids Explosives/Blasting agents 1.5 Class 4 1.5 Flammable liquids Class 3 1.4 Class I-A 1.5 Class 2 1.3 Class I-B 1.4 Class 1 1.2 Class I-C 1.3 Water-reactive materials Flammable solids  1.3 Class 3 1.5 Highly toxic liquids/solids 1.5 Class 2 1.3 Class 1 1.1

 c. "Fixed permit cost" Ninety-eight Dollars ($98.00) is the minimum cost for the Seattle Fire Department to issue a hazardous material permit.

 d. "Base permit fee" is determined by multiplying the sum of the products of the quantity range number and assigned risk factor for each hazard class by the fixed permit cost divided by 1.1 and is represented by the following equation:

 Base permit fee = [((Q)(R)][F/1.1]

 Where: Q = The quantity range number.

 R = The assigned risk factor.

 F = The fixed permit cost ($98.00).

 Example:

 XYZ Company stores five hundred (500) gallons of gasoline and two hundred (200) pounds of nitric acid. Gasoline is classified as a Class I-B flammable liquid which has an assigned risk factor of 1.4. Nitric acid is classified as a corrosive liquid and a Class 1 oxidizer, both of which have an assigned risk factor of 1.1.

 Base permit fee = [(1.25)(1.4)flammable + (1)(1.1)Class 1 oxidizer][$98./1.1]

 Base permit fee = $253.91

 When a material has multiple hazards, only the hazard presented by the material that has been assigned the highest risk factor shall be considered.

~~The base permit fee incorporates the cost of the initial site inspection plus one (1) re-inspection of the facility. Any subsequent inspections will result in an additional fee based on the time charge which shall be calculated on actual costs for labor and other services.~~

~~The annual permit renewal fee will be one-half (through) of the original base permit fee, if the facility is found to be in compliance with the original permit conditions.~~

~~Effective January 1, 1993, those facilities which have existing hazardous materials-related permits authorized under Ordinance 116258 shall have their permits renewed at the rate of Seventy-Five Dollars ($75.00) until the Fire Department Article 80 program inspection and inventory analysis for the facility has been performed.~~

~~In special circumstances, hazardous material permit fees may be adjusted, modified or combined. Authority to adjust, modify or combine such permit fees is limited to the Fire Chief, the Fire Marshal and the Assistant Fire Marshal.~~

 *Biannual Renewal Fee

 D. All permits listed under subsection A and C of this section have a base fee which incorporates the cost of an initial site inspection and one (1) site reinspection to determine compliance with the Seattle Fire Code. Any subsequent inspections will result in a fee based on a time charge which shall be calculated on actual costs for labor and other services. Such fees shall include overtime costs only when the work performed outside normal business hours (eight a.m. (8:00 a.m.) to four-thirty p.m. (4:30 p.m.) Monday through Friday) is required by the Seattle Fire Code or is performed at the request of the owner or responsible person or permit holder.

 E. Temporary permits listed under Schedule A and C will not be renewed on an annual basis.

 F.

 SMC 22.602.050 Fees for subsequent inspections.

 Prior to requesting the Fire Department to witness acceptance tests of fire protection systems or devices, it shall be the responsibility of the owner or the owner's representative to ensure that such systems have been pre-tested and are ready for inspection. Whenever such systems or devices fail the first inspection by the Fire Department, the Chief shall collect, and the responsible party shall pay, a fee for any subsequent inspection until the fire protection systems or devices pass.

 Fees for subsequent inspections shall be as follows:

 $45.00 PER HOUR OF FIELD INSPECTOR TIME WITH A ONE (1) HOUR MINIMUM, FOR EACH OF THE FOLLOWING INSPECTION CATEGORIES:

 Fire Alarm Systems

 Pressure Regulating Valves

 Fire Sprinkler and Standpipe Systems

 Fire Escape Load Tests

 Exit Door Unlock Operations

 Shaft Pressurization

 Sequence Tests

 Elevator Operations

 Fire Dampers

 Flow Tests

 Tempered Window Placement

 Fire Protection Systems for Commercial Food Heat-Processing Equipment

 Other acceptance tests required by the Seattle Fire Code and other applicable standards.

 All subsequent inspections will result in an invoice to the responsible party for each hour of field inspection per field inspector required to correct the deficiency. The invoice shall reflect time spent per inspector, to include preparation and travel time to the site with any time spent past an hour billed to the next quarter hour. EXAMPLE: If two (2) inspectors took one (1) hour and twenty (20) minutes to complete a standpipe system test, the invoice would total One Hundred Thirty-five Dollars ($135.00) (two (2) inspectors ' 1.5 hours).

 Whenever the Fire Prevention Division is requested or required by the Fire Code to perform inspections or plan reviews outside normal business hours (eight a.m. (8:00 a.m.) -- four-thirty p.m. (4:30 p.m.) Monday through Friday) the Chief shall collect and the responsible party shall pay a fee for such an inspection or plan review. Such fees shall be based on actual labor costs including any overtime actually paid as determined by the then-current collective bargaining agreement adopted by ordinance.

 Whenever the Fire Prevention Division is requested to perform an inspection as required by the Fire Code and the responsible party fails to appear within twenty (20) minutes from the original appointment time, the Chief shall collect and the responsible party shall pay a fee for such staff time and preparation required to meet the inspection appointment. Such fees shall be based on actual labor

 costs including any overtime actually paid as determined by the then- current collective bargaining agreement adopted by ordinance.

 Whenever the Fire Prevention Division is required to perform an inspection after three (3) inspections have been performed to gain compliance with Seattle Fire Code requirements, the Chief shall collect and the responsible party shall pay a fee in the amount of One Hundred Dollars ($100.00). Such fee shall be due upon each inspection performed by the Fire Prevention Division until compliance with Seattle Fire Code requirements has been accomplished. The chief shall waive the inspection fee if the original order or notice is determined to be invalid or when mitigating circumstances beyond the responsible party's control exist such as conflicting enforcement by other jurisdictions, conditions caused by third parties or where alternate materials, methods or designs are under review to meet the intent of the Seattle Fire Code.

All permits listed under SMC 22.602.040, Fees have a base fee which incorporates the cost of an initial site inspection and one (1) site re-inspection to determine compliance with the Seattle Fire Code. Any subsequent inspections will result in a fee based on a time charge which shall be calculated on actual costs for labor and other services. Such fees shall include overtime costs only when the work performed outside normal business hours (eight a.m. (8:00 a.m.) to four-thirty p.m. (4:30 p.m.) Monday through Friday) is required by the Seattle Fire Code or is performed at the request of the owner or responsible person or permit holder.
