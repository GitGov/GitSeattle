 AN ORDINANCE relating to the Business and Occupation Tax Code; clarifying the City's intent that the definition of the term "to manufacture" is not limited to business activities involving tangible materials, and amending Chapter 5.44 of the Seattle Municipal Code in accordance therewith.

 WHEREAS Seattle Municipal Code Section 5.44.028(4) defines the term "to manufacture" so that term "embraces all activities of a commercial nature wherein labor or skill is applied, by hand or machinery, to materials so that as a result thereof a new, different or useful article of tangible personal property or substance of trade or commerce is produced;" and,

 WHEREAS the City has always considered that the term "to manufacture" as used in Seattle Municipal Code Section 5.44.028(4) applies not only to tangible personal property, but that it is properly applied to other substances of trade or commerce such as prototypes, working copies, and detailed designs from which a person subject to the code duplicates, or contracts with others to duplicate, copies which that person then sells on that person's own behalf; and,

 WHEREAS this intent is evidenced by the plain language of SMC 5.44.024(2) that includes within the definition of the term "manufacturer" the manufacturing of "articles, substance or commodities," and SMC 5.44.028(4), which does not limit the definition of the term "to manufacture" to tangible materials, but includes in the definition activities that produce a "new, different, or usefulsubstance of trade or commerce," the "production or fabrication of special made or custom articles," "producing articles for sale," and by giving materials or ingredients "new forms, properties, or combinations;" and,

 WHEREAS this intent is further evidenced by the promulgation of Director's Rule Implementing Seattle Business Tax Ordinance ("Tax Rule") 5-44-155(5)(a), which has, since at least 1985, and without legislative disapproval, stated that "[p]ersons who produce prewritten software, and materials in this state and who sell, lease, license, or otherwise transfer such things to buyers outside this state and deliver such things outside this state are not subject to either retailing or wholesaling business tax. Such persons are subject to the Manufacturing classification of business and occupation tax;" and,

 WHEREAS in a recent decision, the King County Superior Court in Walker, Richer, Quinn, Inc. v. City of Seattle, 98-2-16267-8 SEA, interpreted the term "materials" as used in Seattle Municipal Code Section 5.44.028(4) to have included only tangible personal property, and

 WHEREAS given that decision, and without this clarification, certain taxpayers that are currently classified as "manufacturers" would instead be classified and taxed under the "other" classification of SMC 5.44.400(F), at a tax rate almost double the manufacturing rate. The City has never intended to tax those taxpayers at this higher rate,

 NOW, THEREFORE,

 BE IT ORDAINED BY THE CITY OF SEATTLE AS FOLLOWS:

 Section 1. Subsection 5.44.028 (4) of the Seattle Municipal Code is amended as follows:

 SMC 5.44.028 Definitions, S-Z.
