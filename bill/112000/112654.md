 AN ORDINANCE relating to land use and zoning, establishing a moratorium on the acceptance of applications for use permits or construction permits for new single-family dwellings over water along portions of Seaview Avenue Northwest, and declaring an emergency requiring a three-fourths vote of the Seattle City Council so that the Ordinance may take effect immediately.

 BE IT ORDAINED BY THE CITY OF SEATTLE AS FOLLOWS:

 Section 1. The City Council hereby makes the following legislative findings of fact and declarations:

 1. In 1986 the Seattle Shoreline Master Program (SMC 23.60.604) was amended to provide that new single-family dwellings may be permitted as a shoreline conditional use over water along portions of Seaview Avenue Northwest between 34th Avenue Northwest and Northwest 57th Street.

 2. In 1999 the National Marine Fisheries Service listed chinook salmon as a threatened species pursuant to the requirements of the Endangered Species Act.

 3. Chinook salmon are found in the waters of the City of Seattle, including "Salmon Bay".

 4. The City Council intends to take appropriate actions to protect and enhance the environment for fish and other wildlife including, in particular, the threatened chinook salmon.

 5. The shorelines of the City are a unique and scarce resource which should generally be reserved for water-dependent or water- related uses, and single-family residences may be located elsewhere in the City without the need to preclude more appropriate water uses from the shoreline.

 6. Proposed legislation has been introduced to the Seattle City Council which would repeal the authorization for the construction of residences in and over the waters of Salmon Bay provided by SMC 23.60.604 (A) (2).

 7. The proposed legislation, if adopted, may not be effective for several months, thereby allowing development to vest which would be contrary to the intent of the proposed legislation.

 8. The City has received and may receive applications to develop single-family residences in and over the waters of Salmon Bay pursuant to SMC 23.60.604 (A) (2).

 9. If proposals to establish residences in and over the waters of Salmon Bay become legally vested before the City Council has reviewed and acted upon the proposed legislation, the Council's ultimate legislative decision may be frustrated, and uses may be permanently established which are inimical to the public health, safety, and welfare. Because the acquisition of vested rights may be imminent, an emergency exists which requires the adoption of this moratorium ordinance.

 10. The City has legal authority to establish a temporary, permit moratorium pursuant to the authority granted by article 11, Section 11 of the Washington Constitution, the Growth management act, RCW 36.70A.390, and Matson v. Clark County, 79 Wn. App. 641 (1995).

 Section 2. Until August 1, 1999, no use permit application or construction permit application may be accepted or use permit issued for any single-family residence proposed to be located in or over water pursuant to SMC 23.60.604 (A) (2).

 Section 3. This ordinance shall become effective immediately upon the approval or signing of the ordinance by the Mayor or passage over his veto, as provided by the Charter of the City.
