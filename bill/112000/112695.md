 An Ordinance relating to land use and zoning, directing the Executive to study and develop standards relating to signs displaying animation or rapidly changing images or messages, establishing a moratorium and interim regulations with respect to such signs and declaring an emergency requiring a 3/4 vote of the Seattle City Council so that the Ordinance may take effect immediately.

 BE IT ORDAINED BY THE CITY OF SEATTLE AS FOLLOWS:

 Section 1. The City Council hereby makes the following legislative findings of fact and declarations:

 The City of Seattle regulates signs and displays on signs in order to reduce potential traffic safety hazards and visual blight, among other reasons set out in SMC 23.55.001.

 For these reasons the City prohibits or otherwise regulates signs that flash, or which rotate or have moving parts that rotate too rapidly. Prohibited signs are set forth in SMC 23.55.003.

 A major study on electronic signs prepared by the Federal Highway Administration found that "motion or the illusion of motion of lights or other display features," including animation, has "the greatest potential for motorist distraction as well as a dominant visual impact on the aesthetic environment." FHA Report, Part VI, Section L. The FHA study also found that control of the message interval and message cycle as well as appearance of flashing must be regulated to prevent contributing to traffic hazards. FHA report Part VI, sections G-J. Signs, including changing image signs, that display graphics that are animated, or portray motion, or display rapidly moving messages may contribute to traffic safety hazards and/or have adverse aesthetic impacts on the visual environment.

 Signs with the capability of displaying messages in this manner have been constructed in the City of Seattle, in neighboring jurisdictions, and in the City of Portland, and are currently being considered for development by sign owners and potential sign owners in Seattle.

 The City of Seattle must study the circumstances, if any, under which such methods of display would be consistent with the City's purposes for regulating signs and displays on signs.

 The study and resulting legislation, if any, would not be effective for several months, thereby allowing construction of signs or use of existing signs for displaying messages in a manner that could be contrary to the findings of the study and the intent of the legislation.

 The City has legal authority to establish a temporary moratorium on permits for signs and on the methods for displaying messages on existing signs pursuant to authority granted by Article 22, Section 11 of the Washington Constitution, the Growth Management Act, RCW 36.70A.390 and Matson v, Clark County, 79 Wn.App. 641 (1995) and may by ordinance supersede notice provisions contained in prior ordinances.

 A moratorium on the use of these methods for displaying messages on signs does not change the number of signs allowed in the city, nor does it restrict content on signs because messages can be displayed using all methods currently allowed by the Sign Code.

 The foregoing reasons support the finding that an emergency exists.

 Section 2. Through December 1, 1999, or until new land use regulations relating to the methods of display on signs enumerated in Section 3 take effect, whichever is sooner, no permit shall be issued, nor shall any master use permit application or sign permit application be accepted, for the methods of display described in Section 3, nor shall the display of messages using the methods enumerated in Section 3(a) be lawful on any existing sign, unless allowed by subsection B or C.

 Section 3. The following methods of displaying messages on signs visible from the street including permitted or vested signs, are prohibited under the moratorium in this Ordinance except as provided in subsections B and C. Nothing in this ordinance shall affect other requirements of the Land Use or Building Codes.

 A. Methods of displaying messages activated by any means, including electrical, wireless transmission, telephone line, or modem, containing an image or images of words, letters, numbers or graphics that are

 1. Animated or portray motion, or

 2. Where a single message or segment of a message is displayed such that the display time is less than two (2) seconds (including the time required for the message to move onto the sign face), or

 3. Where all segments of the total message take more than ten (10) seconds to be displayed (including the time required for the message to move onto the sign face).

 B. The methods of displaying messages prohibited in subsection A are exempt from this moratorium if the method is used on a sign that meets all of the following development standards:

 1. The sign is an on-premises sign;

 2. The sign is not located in a residential zone, Special Review District, Historical District, Preservation District, or shoreline environment;

 3. The sign area, as measured in square inches, is less than or equal to 1000 square inches;

 4. No single dimension of the sign exceeds three (3) feet; and

 5. The sign is at least thirty (30) linear feet in any direction from any other sign that uses a method of display described in this subsection A.

 C. Special Exception:

 For signs that meet standards set out in B1, B2 and B5 but do not meet standards set out either in B3 or B4, the Director of DCLU may grant a special exception to allow such signs based on the applicant meeting all of the following standards to prevent the signs from contributing to traffic and pedestrian hazards and aesthetic blight.

 1. In addition to the requirements of B2, the sign shall be within the special exception area shown on the map attached as Exhibit A. In certain areas within these boundaries, including Special Review Districts, Historic Districts, Preservation Districts, residential zones and shoreline environments, as shown on the map attached as Exhibit A, the methods of display described in Section 3A are more likely to conflict with the intended character of those areas and are prohibited.

 2. Distance: The sign shall be a minimum distance of fifteen feet (15') from the street edge;

 3. Height: Pole signs shall be at least ten feet (10') above the ground;

 4. Screening: The method of displaying the message, including the motion displayed on the sign, the speed at which the message changes, and the light from the sign shall not distract motorists so as to contribute to traffic hazards.

 5. Hours of operation: The methods of display described in subsection A shall be limited to daylight hours; except that when used on an on-premises sign at a place of public assembly, such methods may be used after daylight, only during the event and within two hours before and one hour after the event.

 6. Sound: Audio speakers on the sign shall only broadcast information directly related to the image displayed on the sign. Hours of audio operation shall be the same as hours of operation of the sign. The volume of the audio shall be no greater than necessary to hear the message within ten feet (10').

 Section 4. Pursuant to SMC 25.05.880, the City Council finds that an exemption under SEPA for this action is necessary to prevent development that is inconsistent with the City's Sign Code and to prevent a possible contribution to traffic safety hazards and adverse aesthetic impacts to the visual environment, while the City conducts a study determining the circumstances, if any, under which such methods of display would be consistent with the City's purposes for regulating signs and displays on signs.

 Section 5. City Council staff shall schedule a public hearing on this ordinance as required by RCW 36.70A.390, and the Department of Design, Construction and Land Use shall prepare a work plan to study the appropriate regulations.

 Section 6. This Ordinance expires December 1, 1999.

 Section 7. By reason of the findings set out in Section 1, and the emergency that is hereby declared to exist, this ordinance shall become effective immediately upon its approval by the Mayor or passage over his veto, as provided by the Charter of the City.

 Section 8. The provisions of this ordinance are declared to be separate and severable. If a court of competent jurisdiction, all appeals having been exhausted or all appeal periods having run, finds any provision of this ordinance to be invalid or unenforceable as to any person or circumstance, such offending provision shall, if feasible, be deemed to be modified to be with the limits of enforceability or validity. However, if the offending provision cannot be so modified, it shall be null and void with respect to the particular person or circumstance, and all other provisions of this ordinance in all other respects, and the offending provision with respect to all other persons and all other circumstances, shall remain valid and enforceable.
