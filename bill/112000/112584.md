 b. Properties in areas already developed predominantly to the permitted L3 density and where L3 scale is well established; or

 c.

 a. Development Characteristics of the Area.

 (1) Either:

 (a) Areas that are already developed predominantly to the permitted L3 density and where L3 scale is well established, or

 (b) Areas that are within an urban center or urban village, except as provided in this subsection below, where less emphasis shall be placed on density and scale compatibility with existing development, when the designation will be consistent with the densities required for the center or village category as established in Section B of the Land Use Element of the Comprehensive Plan, unless otherwise indicated by a neighborhood plan adopted or amended by the City Council after January 1, 1995.

 b. Relationship to the Surrounding Areas.

 (1) Properties in areas that are well served by public transit and have direct access to arterials, so that vehicular traffic is not required to use streets that pass through less intensive residential zones;

 (2) Properties in areas with significant topographic breaks, major arterials or open space that provide sufficient transition to LDT or L1 multifamily development;

 (3) Properties in areas with existing multifamily zoning with close proximity and pedestrian connections to neighborhood services, public open spaces, schools and other residential amenities;

 (4) Properties that are adjacent to business and commercial areas with comparable height and bulk, or where a transition in scale between areas of larger multifamily and/or commercial structures and smaller multifamily development is desirable.

 (a) Areas that are already developed predominantly to the permitted L4 density and where L4 scale is well established, or

 (b) Areas that are within an urban center or urban village, except as provided in this subsection below, where less emphasis shall be placed on density and scale compatibility with existing development, when the designation will be consistent with the densities required for the center or village category as established in Section B of the Land Use Element of the Comprehensive Plan, unless otherwise indicated by a neighborhood plan adopted or amended by the City Council after January 1, 1995.

 (2) Areas of sufficient size to promote a high quality, higher density residential environment where there is good pedestrian access to amenities;

 (3) Areas generally platted with alleys that can provide access to parking, allowing the street frontage to remain uninterrupted by driveways, thereby promoting a street environment better suited to the level of pedestrian activity associated with higher density residential environments;

 (4) Areas with good internal vehicular circulation, and good access to sites, preferably from alleys. Generally, the width of principal streets in the area should be sufficient to allow for two (2) way traffic and parking along at least one (1) curbside.

 (3) Properties with close proximity and with good pedestrian connections to services in neighborhood commercial areas, public open spaces and other residential amenities;

 (4) Properties with well-defined edges providing sufficient separation from adjacent areas of small scale residential development, or where such areas are separated by zones providing a transition in the height, scale and density of development.
