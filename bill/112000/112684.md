 AN ORDINANCE related to the 1999 Annual Budget; authorizing additional expenditures by the Executive Services Department from the Cumulative Reserve Subfund for emerging potential capital projects; all by a three-fourths vote of the City Council.

 WHEREAS, emerging potential capital projects often have costs related to preliminary studies and engineering and control of potential sites before those projects the City plans to undertake are incorporated into the City's six year Capital Improvement Program and budgets can be appropriated through the annual budget process; and

 WHEREAS, in the past, departments have absorbed these preliminary costs in their existing budgets, have used the Emergency Subfund or have forgone opportunities; and

 WHEREAS, there are sufficient unexpended and unencumbered fund balances in the Unrestricted Subaccount in the Cumulative Reserve Subfund to make this appropriation; and

 WHEREAS, it is intended that these funds be used to cover costs that do not exceed $100,000 on any given project and the Cumulative Reserve Subfund be reimbursed from other funding sources when available; and

 WHEREAS, specific projects for this source calling for this funding will be identified by resolution over the course of the year; and

 WHEREAS, the City Council, through the Finance and Budget Committee or another Council committee it may designate, desires to be briefed on the uses of these funds so that the Council may approve such uses by resolution prior to any such expenditure; NOW, THEREFORE,

 BE IT ORDAINED BY THE CITY OF SEATTLE AS FOLLOWS:

 SECTION 1. In order to provide funding for preliminary studies and engineering and control of potential sites for emergent potential capital projects, the Executive Services Department is authorized to expend for such purposes, including for work done by other departments, the following amount from the Cumulative Reserve Subfund:

 Department Project Number Fund Amount

 Executive A17071 11650-Unrestricted $500,000 Services Department

 and the sum of Five Hundred Thousand Dollars ($500,000) is appropriated for those purposes from unexpended and unencumbered balances in the Unrestricted Subaccount of the Cumulative Reserve Subfund. Prior to spending funds available from this source or using such funds to reimburse other funding sources for any specific project, the Executive Services Director or his/her designee must brief the Finance and Budget Committee or another Council committee it may designate and obtain a resolution authorizing the proposed use of these funds. Whenever feasible, the Executive and City Council reimburse the Cumulative Reserve Subfund from other funding sources that become available.

 SECTION 2. The appropriations made in Section 1 in this ordinance shall carry forward from year to year unless expressly abandoned by ordinance.

 SECTION 3. The Executive Services Director or his/her designee shall provide an annual report to the Finance and Budget Committee on actual expenditures from this appropriation.

 SECTION 4. The foregoing appropriation is made to meet actual necessary expenditures of the City for which insufficient or no appropriations have been made due to causes which could not reasonably have been foreseen at the time of the adoption of the 1999 Budget.

 SECTION 5. This ordinance shall take effect and be in force thirty (30) days from and after its approval by the Mayor, but if not approved and returned by the Mayor within ten (10) days after presentation, it shall take effect as provided by Municipal Code

 Section 1.04.020.
