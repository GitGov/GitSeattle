 AN ORDINANCE relating to low-income housing, amending the 1999-2000 Administrative and Financial Plan adopted in Ordinance 119168 for the 1995 Housing Levy; reallocating funding from the Home Buyer Assistance program to the Homeowner Rehabilitation program; reducing prior appropriations for the Home Buyer Assistance program and amending the 1999 Adopted Budget to appropriate funds for the Homeowner Rehabilitation Program; all by a three-fourths vote of all of the members of the City Council.

 WHEREAS, pursuant to Ordinance 117711, as amended, the voters of The City of Seattle approved the levy of property taxes for the purpose of financing low-income housing, including housing for very low-income households under RCW 84.52.105, and established allocations of revenues to certain programs; and

 WHEREAS, Section 8 of Ordinance 117711 provides that the City Council, on recommendation of the Oversight Committee, or on recommendation of the Mayor, or on its own motion, may make changes in the funds allocated to programs, consistent with the basic purposes of Ordinance 117711 and applicable law; and

 WHEREAS, a portion of the funding allocated by Ordinance 117711 to home buyer assistance is subject to reallocation under said Section 8, and is not expected to be needed for home buyer assistance; and

 WHEREAS, Ordinance 117711 and the Affordable Housing Financing Plan attached thereto provide for periodic submission to the City Council of an Administrative and Financial Plan for programs funded by the 1995 Housing Levy ("Levy Programs"); and

 WHEREAS, in Ordinance 119168 the City Council approved the 1999-2000 Administrative and Financial Plan for the 1995 Housing Levy (the "A and F Plan"); and

 WHEREAS, on August 17, 1999 the Housing Levy Oversight Committee voted to recommend that the City Council approve the amendments to the 1999- 2000 A and F Plan as proposed by the Office of Housing and further amended by the Housing Levy Oversight Committee, which changes include a reallocation of funding from the Home Buyer assistance program to the Homeowner Rehabilitation (home repair) program; and

 WHEREAS, in addition to such reallocations, the Homeowner Rehabilitation program requires appropriations for 1999, and unappropriated 1995 Housing Levy revenues are available; Now, therefore,

 BE IT ORDAINED BY THE CITY OF SEATTLE AS FOLLOWS:

 Section 1. The 1995 Seattle Housing Levy Administrative and Financial Plan for Program Years 1999-2000 is hereby amended as set forth in Exhibit A to this ordinance. The Director of the Office of Housing is authorized to make any technical and conforming amendments that may be necessary to implement the intent of the changes shown on Exhibit A.

 Section 2.

 A. The following amounts of 1995 Housing Levy revenues collected or to be collected in the following years are hereby reallocated from the Home Buyer Assistance program to the Homeowner Rehabilitation program:

 1997: $ 94,973.00

 1998: $106,394.00

 1999: $118,157.00

 B. The appropriations in the 1997, 1998 and 1999 Adopted Budgets in the 1995 Home Buyer Assistance Subfund are hereby reduced by the above respective amounts, and the same amounts shall be transferred to the 1995 Low-Income Housing Levy Subfund and are hereby appropriated for the Homeowner Rehabilitation program, as an amendment to the 1999 Adopted Budget. The 1999 Adopted Budget is further amended by the appropriation of an additional FOUR HUNDRED FIFTEENSIXTEEN THOUSAND NINESEVEN HUNDRED EIGHTY-SEVENFOURTEEN DOLLARS ($4156,987714.00) from the 1995 Low-Income Housing Levy Subfund for Homeowner Rehabilitation, such amount to be supported by revenues from the 1995 Housing Levy received through 1999 and not yet appropriated. Therefore, the total appropriation in the 1999 Adopted Budget for the Homeowner Rehabilitation Program, as amended hereby, is SEVEN HUNDRED THIRTY- FIVE THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED ELEVEN AND NO/100 DOLLARS ($735,511.00). Unexpended and unobligated balances of all appropriations in this ordinance shall carry forward from year to year until expressly abandoned by ordinance.

 C. Nothing in this section shall authorize the transfer of revenues deposited or required to be deposited in the Home Purchase Revolving Loan Account under Section 6.B of Ordinance 117711, or the use of such revenues for any purposes except as stated in that Section. Subject to the foregoing sentence, all transfers from the 1995 Levy Home Buyer Assistance Subfund (as established in Section 6.A of Ordinance 117711) that are necessary to implement the intent of this ordinance are hereby authorized.

 Section 3. Any actions pursuant to the authority granted by this ordinance and prior to the effective date hereof are hereby ratified and confirmed.

 Section 4. The foregoing appropriations are made to meet actual necessary expenditures of the City for which insufficient appropriation has been made due to causes which could not reasonably have been foreseen at the time of the making of the 1999 budget; therefore, in accordance with RCW 35.32A, by reason of the facts above stated, this ordinance shall take effect and be in force thirty (30) days from and after its approval by the Mayor, but if not approved and returned by the Mayor within ten (10) days after presentation, it shall take effect as provided by Municipal Code Section 1.04.020.
