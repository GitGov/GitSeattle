 AN ORDINANCE relating to the Department of Housing and Human Services (DHHS); modifying allocations of federal funds under the HOME Program for 1996 and 1998; appropriating additional 1998 HOME funds; superseding Exhibit A to Ordinance 118604; authorizing amendments to the City's Consolidated Plans; amending the 1998 Budget of DHHS; and ratifying and confirming prior acts.

 WHEREAS, the City's 1998 update to its 1997-1998 Consolidated Plan approved by Resolution 29652 provided for the allocation of anticipated 1998 grant funds under the federal HOME Investments Partnerships ("HOME") Program, and the amount of anticipated 1998 HOME funds was appropriated in the 1998 Adopted Budget; and

 WHEREAS, the actual 1998 HOME allocation to the City of Seattle is more than anticipated; and

 WHEREAS, the 1998 allocation to the Rehabilitation and Energy Assistance for City Homeowners ("REACH") Program is no longer needed because the program income of REACH has been greater than anticipated; and

 WHEREAS, $40,000 in HOME funds allocated in 1996 for Community Land Trust (CLT) projects has not yet been committed, and moving these funds to the 1998 allocation list will permit more flexibility to continue to be set aside for a CLT project; Now, Therefore,

 BE IT ORDAINED BY THE CITY OF SEATTLE AS FOLLOWS:

 Section 1. In order to enable DHHS to use underexpended HOME funds from the 1996 CLT allocation, to move 1998 REACH funds to the Home Buyer Program because the funds are no longer needed, and to provide for the use of additional 1998 HOME funds appropriated under Section 2 of this ordinance, the 1996 and 1998 HOME Program Allocations set forth in Ordinance 118604, Exhibit A, and in the 1998 update to the 1997-1998 Consolidated Plan (Table 1.13), are hereby revised and superseded by the allocations set forth in Exhibit A to this Ordinance.

 Section 2. In order to expend unanticipated 1998 revenues from HUD under the HOME Program, the appropriation in the 1998 Budget of the Department of Housing and Human Services from the Low Income Housing Fund (164), HOME Program Subfund 90 is hereby increased by Two Hundred Fifty-Two Thousand Dollars ($252,000), for the purposes set forth on Exhibit A to this ordinance. The acceptance of such additional funds and their deposit in such Subfund are hereby authorized. The Mayor or Director of DHHS is authorized to execute, for and on behalf of The City of Seattle, a grant agreement and such other documents and assurances as HUD may require for such purpose.

 Section 3. In order to pay for necessary administrative expenses, the expenditure allowance in the 1998 Budget of DHHS, Program Category H13, is hereby increased by Twenty-Five Thousand Two Hundred Dollars ($25,200). The increased appropriation of HOME funds set forth in Section 2 above shall support this increased expenditure allowance.

 Section 4. To the extent that the reallocation of $40,000 of 1996 HOME funds as shown on Exhibit A may be considered to require abandonment of such amount of 1996 appropriations and re-appropriation of such amount in the 1998 Budget, such abandonment and re- appropriation are hereby made and authorized. The unexpended balances of appropriations of 1996 and 1998 HOME funds for the purposes reflected in Exhibit A shall continue to carry forward from year to year unless expressly abandoned by ordinance.

 Section 5. The Director of the Department of Housing and Human Services is authorized to amend the City's Consolidated Plans to implement the provisions of this ordinance.

 Section 6. Any action pursuant to the authority and prior to the effective date of this ordinance is hereby ratified and confirmed.

 Section 7. This ordinance shall take effect and be in force thirty (30) days from and after its approval by the Mayor, but if not approved and returned by the Mayor within ten (10) days after presentation, it shall take effect as provided by Seattle Municipal Code Section 1.04.020.
