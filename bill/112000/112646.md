 AN ORDINANCE establishing licensing requirements and procedures for holders of retailer's liquor licenses who permit or allow added entertainment and establishing penalties for violations.

 BE IT ORDAINED BY THE CITY OF SEATTLE AS FOLLOWS:

 Section 1. A new chapter 6.295 is added to the Seattle Municipal Code as follows:

 6.295.010 Legislative Findings.

 RCW 66.28.080 authorizes the City to establish an Added Entertainment licensing program. This license permits restaurants, taverns, clubs or other establishments holding a retailer's liquor license to offer entertainment, such as dancing, singing, music, or theatrical performances at the licensed establishment. This ordinance is intended to establish a formal, fair process for the granting, denying, or suspending of an Added Entertainment license without imposing excessive regulation on business owners in the City. As such, the City will, to the greatest extent possible, coordinate the development and implementation of this licensing program with the State Liquor Control Board's liquor license process. This ordinance is also intended to promote and protect the public health, safety and welfare of those patronizing and employed at establishments operating added entertainment.

 6.295.020 Definitions.

 For the purpose of this ordinance:

 A. "Added Entertainment" means any dancing, singing, music or other entertainment such as exhibitions, theatrical performances, shows or similar amusements conducted or participated in by patrons, members, entertainers, employees or other persons upon the premises of an establishment which has a retailer's liquor license.

 B. "Board" means the Washington State Liquor Control Board.

 C. "Chief" means the Chief of the Seattle Police Department or the Chief's designee.

 D. "City" means the City of Seattle.

 E. "Director" means the Director of the Executive Services Department or the Director's designee.

 F. "Liquor" has the same meaning as in Title 66 Revised Code of Washington.

 G. "Person" means any individual, sole proprietorship, partnership, corporation, association, or other public or private organization of any character.

 H. "Premises" means the location where a liquor licensee does business and shall include any room, place, space, or portion thereof, including hallways, bathrooms, parking lots and all other adjoining areas under the licensee's control and accessible to the patrons, employees or members of such establishment.

 6.295.030 Added Entertainment Permit or License Required.

 A. It is unlawful for any person holding a retailer's liquor license to permit or allow upon the premises of any licensed liquor establishment any added entertainment without first having obtained an "Added Entertainment Permit" or "Added Entertainment License" for that premises as required by this Chapter. An Added Entertainment Permit is required when an event involving added entertainment is operated on no more than one occasion per year lasting no more than three (3) consecutive twenty-four (24)-hour periods. An Added Entertainment License is required for all other added entertainment upon the premises of a licensed liquor establishment.

 B. Grandfather clause. A person who has permission from the City to allow added entertainment as of the effective date of this ordinance shall be presumed to be entitled to receive an Added Entertainment license without completion of the initial application or payment of the initial application fee pursuant to Section 6.295.040, unless grounds for denial under Section 6.295.080 or suspension under Sections 6.295.100 or 6.295.120 are determined by the Director to exist. A person eligible for a license under this subsection shall pay the annual license fee to obtain the license.
