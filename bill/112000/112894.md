 AN ORDINANCE relating to the Seattle Arts Commission; creating a position in support of the Libraries for All Capital Program and the Municipal Arts Plan, increasing an expenditure allowance and making an appropriation in connection therewith, all by a three-fourths vote of the City Council.

 WHEREAS, the Seattle Arts Commission and the Library Board of Trustees have signed a Memorandum of Understanding related to the 1% for Art component of the Libraries for All Capital Program stating the Library's intention to integrate art into the design of the new Central Library and new branch libraries, and to contract with the Arts Commission to manage these projects; and

 WHEREAS, the Memorandum of Understanding further states that in 1999, the Arts Commission shall assign a half-time project manager to develop and manage the Libraries for All public art program; the funding for which shall come from the transfer of funds from the arts budget established for the Libraries for All Capital Project to the Municipal Arts Fund (Fund 626); and

 WHEREAS, in April 1999, the Mayor approved the 1999-2000 Municipal Art Plan ("MAP"), the largest such plan in the history of the Seattle Arts Commission, which includes 27 new projects (including the Municipal Civic Campus Project), most of which are scheduled to begin in 1999; and

 WHEREAS, the Arts Commission has determined that the number of project management staff currently authorized is insufficient to support the increased work program associated with the MAP and has further determined that projected revenues to Fund 626 from the City's Percent for Art Program are sufficient to support the addition of a full-time public art project manager but that only 0.5 FTE should be requested at this time for such purpose; and

 WHEREAS, the Executive Director of the Arts Commission has presented a staffing proposal that would implement the staffing requirements of the Libraries for All Program and would provide minimum project management support for the expanded MAP; and, further, the Arts Commission anticipates that the new staffing position will sunset after 2003;

 NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT ORDAINED BY THE CITY OF SEATTLE AS FOLLOWS:

 Section 1. The following position is created in the Seattle Arts Commission to provide project management support resources for the Libraries for All Program and the Municipal Arts Plan:

 The Executive Director of the Arts Commission is authorized to fill the same subject to personnel laws and rules.

 Section 2. If the position authorized in Section 1 hereof exists in 2003, the Executive, with the cooperation of the Executive Director of the Arts Commission, shall conduct a sunset review for the position in the second quarter of 2003, to determine if this level of staffing is still needed to support the Libraries for All Capital Program and/or the Municipal Arts Plan.

 Section 3. To provide for the compensation and benefits associated with the position created in Section 1 hereof, Program Category V5A, "Public Art" in the 1999 Budget of the Seattle Arts Commission is increased in the sum of Eleven Thousand Nine Hundred Forty Dollars ($11,940) by the appropriation, hereby made and authorized, of a like sum from the Supplemental Appropriations Account of the Emergency Subfund for the purposes outlined above. The Supplemental Appropriations Account of the Emergency Subfund shall be reimbursed from funds to be received from the Municipal Arts Fund (Fund 626).

 Section 4. Any act consistent with the authority but prior to the effective date of this ordinance, including the filling of the employment position created by Section 1 hereof, is hereby ratified and confirmed.

 Section 5.
