 AN ORDINANCE relating to utility cuts and other openings in City streets, alleys, and other public places for construction or other activities, imposing a new charge to recover costs resulting from the loss in useful street pavement life caused by utility cuts and other openings in certain types of City streets.

 BE IT ORDAINED BY THE CITY OF SEATTLE AS FOLLOWS:

 WHEREAS, the City of Seattle, Washington (the "City"), possesses a transportation system that is vital to the economic vitality of the City and the enhancement of the City's quality of life and is an important public function; and millions of dollars in public funds have been invested to construct, maintain and repair streets within the city limits and the City holds these streets as a valuable public asset for its citizens; and

 WHEREAS, the City Council, with the Mayor concurring, adopted Resolution 29587 stating the City's intent to review permit fees and rates paid by public and private utilities and other entities that obtain permits to cut City streets to determine if such fees and rates cover the full cost of restoring the street to its original condition and reflect compensation for any loss of, or reduction in, the useful life of the street; and

 WHEREAS, the City Council, with the Mayor concurring, enacted Ordinance 118751 to preserve the City's investment in its transportation system and ensure that the street area around utility cuts and other permitted cuts is restored to its original condition as quickly and efficiently as possible; and

 WHEREAS, the aforementioned Ordinance directs that permittees shall pay to the Director of Transportation or, as to park drives and boulevards, the Superintendent of Parks and Recreation, a standard charge from a schedule adopted by ordinance reflecting the Director of Transportation's estimate of the loss in useful life of the street, alley, or other public place as a result of the construction or other activity; and

 WHEREAS, City has the power to regulate encroachments, cuts and excavations in the public right of way to protect the health, safety and welfare of its citizens; and

 WHEREAS, utility cuts and other cuts and excavations in city streets can significantly disrupt and interfere with public use of the streets, and obstruction of the streets during the openings can result in a loss of parking and in a loss of business to merchants; and

 WHEREAS, engineering studies performed on streets in the Cities of Burlington, Austin, Cincinnati, Kansas City, Los Angeles, Sacramento, San Francisco, and Union City have all concluded that no matter how well the excavation is restored, excavations in paved streets degrade and shorten life of the streets by weakening pavement support surrounding the patches and resulting in deterioration at an accelerated rate; and

 WHEREAS, in order to determine the extent of the pavement damage due to utility cuts and other street openings in the City of Seattle, Seattle Transportation (SEATRAN) retained Nichols

 WHEREAS, the engineering study performed by NV&A, dated October 1999, and on file in the office of Director of Street Maintenance Division, SEATRAN, concludes that, for flexible and rigid base asphalt-surfaced street pavements, street damage occurs no matter how well the excavation is restored, and the excavation accelerates the deterioration and reduces the useful life of the streets; and

 WHEREAS, it is in the public interest to impose a loss in useful street life fee to be paid by makers of utility cuts and other openings in order to recover the increased street repaving and reconstruction costs attributable to these cuts but currently borne by tax-payers, with revenues paid to the City as a result of this fee not to exceed the repaving and reconstruction costs incurred by the City that are attributable to the impact of cuts in City streets;

 NOW, THEREFORE,

 BE IT ORDAINED BY THE CITY OF SEATTLE AS FOLLOWS:

 SECTION 1. As recommended by the Director of Transportation and as authorized by SMC 15.32.160 (F), the schedule entitled "Schedule of Charges for the Loss in Useful Street Life Caused by Utility Cuts" adopted to govern the fees charged for loss in street life caused by utility cuts and other openings permitted pursuant to Seattle Municipal Code Chapter 15.32, shall be as follows:

 Calculation of fee. In addition to any other applicable fees and charges, each applicant for a permit for construction or other activity under SMC Chapter 15.32 shall pay to the Director of Transportation, or as to parks drives and boulevards, the Superintendent of Parks and Recreation, a Loss in Useful Street Life Fee, to recover the increased street repaving and reconstruction costs incurred by the City as a result of utility cuts and other openings authorized under that permit. The amount of the fee shall be $17.70 per square foot of pavement area to be cut. The fee will apply to all flexible and rigid base asphalt-surfaced street pavements. The fee will not be applied to other types of pavement including portland cement concrete (PCC) and bituminous (chipseal) street pavements. The fee shall be paid regardless of whether permanent restoration of the cut or opening is completed by the permittee or by the Director of Transportation.

 Fee waived for excavation that includes repaving. The Loss in Useful Street Life Fee shall be waived for an applicant who proposes to repave or reconstruct the entire street section affected by the cut from curb to curb where such repaving or reconstruction is performed consistent with all the standards set forth in rules, plans, and specifications of Seattle Transportation.

 Fee waived for excavation coordination. To improve and encourage coordination of street improvement and utility work in order to minimize traffic disruption and untimely pavement deterioration, the Loss in Useful Street Life Fee shall be waived for cuts in a street that the City has scheduled for repaving during the year when the excavation permit is issued or during the immediately following year.

 (d) Fee waived for excavation in poor pavement quality streets. To discourage cuts in newer resurfaced streets, the Loss in Useful Street Life Fee shall be waived for cuts in a street where the existing pavement quality is very poor to failed, as defined by the City's Pavement Management System, or is less than Overall Condition Index (OCI) 25 on the date the excavation permit is issued.

 (e) Fee waived for public transportation purposes. The Director of Transportation may waive the Loss in Useful Street Life Fee if the Director determines that the utility cut or other opening is made necessary as a result of a surface or subsurface public transportation project being implemented by a public agency and that the waiver is in the public interest.

 SECTION 2. As required by SMC 15.32.160 (F), all proceeds collected from the Loss in Useful Street Life Fee shall be deposited in the Transportation Fund, or as to park drives and boulevards, the Parks and Recreation Fund, and used only for pavement replacement, repair, and maintenance, and not for any other purpose.

 SECTION 3. Eighteen (18) months after passage of this legislation, the Director of Transportation shall meet with public and private utilities and other affected parties to review the results of this legislation's implementation. The Director may recommend appropriate modifications to the legislation based upon such review.

 SECTION 4. In all cases of dispute regarding fees, permits or other matters relating to this ordinance, the decision of the Director of Transportation shall be final and conclusive.

 SECTION 5. To implement the provisions of this ordinance, the Director of Transportation shall adopt such rules and regulations as he or she deems necessary.

 SECTION 6. This ordinance shall take effect and be in force thirty (30) days from and after its approval by the Mayor, but if not approved and returned by the Mayor within ten (10) days after presentation, it shall take effect as provided by Municipal Code

 Section 1.04.020.
