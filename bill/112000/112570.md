 AN ORDINANCE relating to library capital facilities; authorizing the Seattle Public Library Board of Trustees to carry out the Project authorized in Ordinance 119019; appropriating bond proceeds in the 1999 budget for the Library Board to spend on the Project; authorizing contracts to carry out the Project and agreements with the Seattle Arts Commission and the Seattle Design Commission; establishing the status of assets funded with bond proceeds; providing for the disposition of proceeds from any sale or exchange of bond-funded library assets; and committing to expenditures for public art located at or within the central library and neighborhood branch libraries.

 WHEREAS, in May 1998 the Seattle Public Library Board of Trustees (the "Board") approved, and the City Council in Resolution 29761 expressed its support of, a Seattle Public Libraries Capital Plan referred to as "Libraries for All;" and

 WHEREAS, in November 1998 the voters of The City of Seattle approved the proposition submitted to them by Ordinance 119019 to acquire, design, construct, renovate, improve, and equip library capital facilities (the "Project") throughout the City; and

 WHEREAS, Section 1 of Ordinance 119019 states that the City shall authorize the Board to carry out the Project for the City; and

 WHEREAS, Ordinance 119019 provides for a Libraries for All Oversight Committee (the "Oversight Committee") and a November 24, 1998, resolution of the Board provides for a Citizen Implementation Review Panel, each of which will have a unique role in enabling public oversight of and input to the Board as it carries out the Project; and

 WHEREAS, Chapter 27.12 RCW makes the Library unique among City departments in that the Board has exclusive control over the finances of the Library consistent with the annual appropriation of money by the City Council; and

 WHEREAS, the Project is unique due to the multiplicity of capital facilities involved, the oversight mechanisms established by previous legislation, and the independence and fiscal responsibility granted to the Board by state law; and

 WHEREAS, Section 4 of Ordinance 119019 provides that "For the longer of (a) the time the series of bonds that funded each improvement is outstanding or (b) the useful life of that improvement, each improvement made with proceeds of the bonds may only be transferred, sold, leased, exchanged, or devoted for a substantial period of time to another purpose if the proceeds attributable to the improvement are devoted to library capital purposes;" and

 WHEREAS, Resolution 29847 of The City of Seattle states the City's legislative intent that "If any assets, which are purchased with bond proceeds (including materials in collections that may become surplus), are later sold or transferred, any funds or property received in exchange shall be devoted for library purposes or repayment of the outstanding bonds;" and

 WHEREAS, the foregoing protections for assets acquired with library bond proceeds are appropriate; and

 WHEREAS, the Project includes improving existing library capital facilities, some of which are held by the City for general municipal purposes and some of which are held in trust for library purposes; and

 WHEREAS, Resolution 29847 of The City of Seattle states the City's legislative intent that art purchased under the "One Percent for Art" program with library bond proceeds be located at or within the central library or a neighborhood branch library; and

 WHEREAS, the City Council wishes to recognize the unique nature of the Project and the special situation of the Board while imposing, to a limited but appropriate extent, constraints upon the appropriation of City bond proceeds to be used by the Board for the Project;

 Now, therefore, BE IT ORDAINED BY THE CITY OF SEATTLE AS FOLLOWS:

 Section 1. Authority to carry out Project elements and enter into contracts. The City authorizes the Board to acquire, design, construct, renovate, improve, and equip the elements of the Project for the City, within budgetary constraints and consistent with Ordinance 119019, Ordinance 119185, this ordinance, and state law. To do so, the Board, or such of its officers and staff as the Board designates, shall, without need for further City Council action and notwithstanding subsection 3.24.040C of the Seattle Municipal Code, have the power to enter into all contracts the Board deems appropriate. In contracting for public works design and construction services, the Board shall comply with all applicable state laws. In procuring goods and services for which procedures are not mandated by state law, the Board may use procedures different from those spelled out in the Seattle Municipal Code only after it identifies the planned different procedures to the Oversight Committee and the Oversight Committee has reported the same to the City Council. The City's Executive Services Director is directed to assist the Board as requested in developing contracting and procurement practices suitable for the Project. The Board may use any or all City procurement resources on such terms as it and the Executive Services Director deem appropriate.

 Section 2. Reduction of appropriation and reappropriation of bond proceeds. The sum of Ten Million Three Hundred Eighty-Nine Thousand Dollars ($10,389,000), or so much thereof as has not yet been expended or encumbered by the Budget Director for Project purposes, is hereby reduced from the 1999 budget of the Department of Finance General in the 1998 Libraries for All Fund. That same amount is hereby reappropriated for expenditure by the Seattle Public Library Board of Trustees consistent with Ordinance 119019, Ordinance 119185, this ordinance, and state law. Future years' capital funding for the Project will be appropriated through the regular annual budget process.

 Section 3. Involvement of Arts and Design Commissions. By May 15, 1999, the Board shall sign appropriate agreements with the Seattle Arts Commission and the Seattle Design Commission concerning these commissions' involvement in the Project. These commissions are authorized to enter into and carry out such agreements with the Board in connection with the Project as the commissioners deem appropriate.

 Section 4. Status of bond-financed acquisitions and improvements. Assets acquired and improvements made with bond proceeds as part of the Project shall be held as general municipal purpose property and used for library purposes consistent with Ordinance 119019, except that improvements to existing library facilities that are presently held in trust for libraries shall become part of the trust property.

 Section 5. Subsequent use of proceeds. In addition to the limitations contained in Section 4 of Ordinance 119019 recited above, if any assets purchased with proceeds of the bonds authorized by Ordinance 119185 (including materials in collections that may become surplus) are later sold or transferred, any funds or property received in exchange shall be devoted for library purposes or repayment of the outstanding bonds.

 Section 6. "One Percent for Art" commitment. At least one percent (1%) of budgeted costs for the construction phase of the Project shall be used for public works of art. Funding for public art may come from bond proceeds consistent with the limitations of Section 2 of Ordinance 119019, and from other eligible sources available to the Board. The Library Board of Trustees will work to increase the art presence in Libraries for All facilities. Art purchased with bond proceeds shall be located at or within the central library or a neighborhood branch library.

 Section 7. Reporting requirements. The City Council reaffirms the importance of the reporting requirements in Section 6 of Ordinance 119019 and requests that the Library Board inform and consult with both the Libraries for All Oversight Committee and the Citizen Implementation Review Panel prior to significantly altering the floor space or total dollar commitments for each individual library facility from those shown in Attachment A to Resolution 29846. The City Council requests that the Board report to the Culture, Arts and Parks Committee or its functional successor once a month on Project progress. Library Board reports to the City Council should address, among other items, progress toward achievement of key Project milestones, which should be identified in annual resolutions of the Board.

 Section 8. Effective date. This ordinance shall take effect and be in force thirty (30) days from and after its approval by the Mayor, but if not approved and returned by the Mayor within ten (10) days after presentation, it shall take effect as provided by Municipal Code Section 1.04.020.
