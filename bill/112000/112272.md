Classrooms and assembly rooms in such buildings need not be so equipped.

 Section 173. The Uniform Fire Code is amended by adding thereto a new Article, Article 193, to read as follows: ARTICLE 193 MINIMUM STANDARD FOR HIGH-RISE BUILDINGS SECTION 19301 -- GENERAL

 19301.1 Purpose. The main purpose of this article is to improve the fire and life safety of existing high-rise buildings that do not conform to current City codes so that the health, safety and welfare of the general public is provided for and promoted. It is recognized that the application of present day fire protection techniques to some existing high-rise buildings is difficult. For this reason, this article may permit the use of alternative methods and innovative approaches and techniques to achieve its purpose, when approved by the chief and the Building Official.

 19301.2 Scope. This article shall apply to all high-rise buildings in existence at the time of its adoption, as well as to all high-rise buildings coming into existence after the adoption thereof.

 19301.2.1 Hazards and design features. Whenever the chief shall find a condition in a high-rise building not specifically addressed in this Article, which in his opinion makes fire escape or fire fighting unusually difficult, he shall declare it to be a hazard, notify the owner of such condition and order its correction in a manner consistent with these minimum safeguards.

 19301.2.2 Exempt Buildings. The chief and the Director of the Department of Construction and Land Use may exempt high-rise buildings that meet the requirements of Section 403 of the Building Code from complying with provisions of this Article.

 19301.2.3 Conflicts. Where there is a conflict between an ordinance or code and the provisions of this article, this article shall govern unless the ordinance or code establishes more stringent fire and life safety requirements.

 19301.3 Definitions. For the purpose of this Article, certain words shall be construed as specified in this section.

 CENTRAL STATION: A fire alarm reporting service listed by the Underwriters Laboratories or authorized by the chief to report alarms to the Seattle Fire Department Alarm Center. In lieu of connection to a central station listed by Underwriters Laboratories, the chief may approve building staff monitoring of a fire alarm annunciator panel where: 1. Such staff are properly trained to monitor the annunciator panel and report alarm signals to the fire department alarm center via the 9-1-1 system. 2. One or more building staff is on duty 24 hours a day and, remains in the direct vicinity of the annunciator panel, e.g., a hotel desk clerk where the panel is behind the registration desk. 3. Staff persons in low income high-rise buildings whose primary duty requires them to be at the front desk are available.

 DEAD-END CORRIDOR: A corridor which permits only one direction of travel from a unit or normally occupied room door to an exit, or which intersects an exit corridor on one end and does not provide an exit path on the other end. A corridor which has fire escapes directly accessible from it is not a dead-end corridor.

 FLOOR USED FOR HUMAN OCCUPANCY: A floor designed and intended for occupancy by one or more persons for any part of a day, including a roof garden and an active storage area. An area that is permanently unoccupied or is occupied for the service of building equipment only is not included in this definition.

 HIGH-RISE BUILDING: Buildings having floors used for human occupancy located more than 75 feet above the lowest level of fire department vehicle access.

 LOW INCOME RESIDENTIAL BUILDINGS: Are defined for this Article as those buildings that meet the following requirements: 1. At least fifty percent (50%) of the dwelling or housing units as defined in the Housing Code (Seattle Municipal Code Ch. 22.204) are rented to non- transient persons at a rent at or below .9% of the current median income for all families in the Seattle area as determined by the United States Department of Housing and Urban Development; and 2. The average monthly rent for all dwelling or housing units in the building does not exceed 1.4% of the Median Income Limit.

 For purposes of calculating the average monthly rent, a room which is rented on a hostel-style basis to three (3) or more non-related persons shall be considered as one room rented for $200 per month.

 Monthly rent shall include all charges for shelter and provision of items normally associated with such use, but shall not include board, health care, telephone charges and other such items.

 SECTION 19302 -- EXITS

 19302.1 General. All exits in high-rise buildings shall be illuminated as required in Section 1211 of this Code and enclosed with a minimum of one- hour fire resistive construction. Every high-rise building shall have at least one such exit. Where existing exterior fire escapes are used for additional exits, they shall be tested and identified as required in Section 19302.3.

 19302.2 Smokeproof enclosure. Where a high-rise building has a single, enclosed exit, the enclosure shall be continued to the exterior of the building and the exit shall be smoke-proof by mechanical ventilation in accordance with Section 3310 of the 1982 Seattle Building Code, or shall be mechanically pressurized with fresh air to 0.15 inches water column and shall have a concurrent 2500 cubic feet per minute (CFM) exhaust to atmosphere in an emergency, in accordance with the provisions of the Building Code.EXCEPTIONS: 1. Pressurization may be omitted when the building has an approved automatic sprinkler system, all corridor openings are self-closing, all occupied areas have access to a second means of egress or a fire escape and the omission is approved by the chief. 2.

 19302.3 Fire Escapes. Exterior fire escapes shall be accessible and structurally safe at all times. Owners of high-rise buildings shall load test fire escapes at least once every five (5) years with a weight of not less than 100 lb/sq. foot. The results of such a load test shall be submitted in writing to the chief. In lieu of such a test, the chief may accept the opinion of a structural engineer licensed by the State of Washington describing his inspection and/or tests and stating that the fire escape is structurally safe and will support a load of 100 lb/sq. foot. There shall be signs approved by the chief clearly identifying the route of access to the fire escape from every public corridor. Fire escapes which are not maintained structurally safe and not otherwise required by provisions of the Fire Code shall be removed.

 Locked doors or windows are prohibited between public corridors and fire escapes. EXCEPTIONS: Where all of the following criteria are met and approved by the chief: 1.
