 WHEREAS, the Project will benefit low- and moderate-income persons, which will satisfy the CD Float Loan policies, and the City's Loan Committee has approved the proposed Loan in accordance with those policies; and

 WHEREAS, the Project is expected to create approximately 41 new jobs, at least 51 percent of which will be made available to low and moderate-income persons; and

The amount of up to ONE MILLION FOUR HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS ($1,400,000) is hereby appropriated from the Housing and Community Development Revenue Sharing Fund for such purpose.

 Section 2. The Loan shall be payable upon the earlier of (i) thirty (30) months or (ii) ten (10) days after demand by the City. The Loan shall bear interest at an appropriate rate to be determined by the OED Director, not to exceed four percent (4%) per annum. Interest shall be payable monthly, or on such schedule as the OED Director determines is appropriate. The OED Director may require a loan fee from Central Coop, payable to the City, not to exceed 1.0 % of the maximum Loan amount, which fee shall be deposited in the Housing and Community Development Revenue Sharing Fund. The OED Director is authorized to cause all or a portion of such fee to be (a) paid to the National Development Council ("NDC") in accordance with an existing contract under which NDC develops and facilitates eligible CD Float Loan projects; (b) applied to legal and other costs related to the administration of the transaction authorized by this ordinance; and/or (c) applied to payment of expenses incurred in the administration of any federally funded economic development projects or programs administered by the OED Director. The amount of up to FOURTEEN THOUSAND DOLLARS ($14,000) is hereby appropriated for such purposes from the Housing and Community Development Revenue Sharing Fund, subject to receipt of such funds in payment of the loan fee.

 Section 3. The Loan shall be secured by one or more irrevocable letters of credit that shall have a total amount available for drawing, at all times, at least equal to the outstanding principal amount and accrued interest, plus all additional interest that will accrue for the next 30 days. The letter(s) of credit shall be issued or confirmed by a commercial bank satisfactory to the OED Director and shall be in form and content satisfactory to the OED Director.

 Section 4. Disbursement of the Loan shall be conditioned upon satisfactory environmental review in accordance with CDBG requirements, and upon other conditions required by law or deemed appropriate by the OED Director.

 Section 6. The OED Director is hereby authorized to take such other actions and execute and deliver such other documents as shall be reasonably necessary or appropriate to carry out the intent of this Ordinance.

 Section 7. Payments of interest on the Loan and principal repayments shall be deposited in the Housing and Community Development Revenue Sharing Fund, and may be expended pursuant to any past or future appropriations of CDBG funds, whether in the annual budget or otherwise, unless such other appropriations are limited by their express terms to CDBG program income from other programs.

The Director of the Department of Housing and Human Services is authorized to amend the City of Seattle's Consolidated Plan and to take such other actions as are appropriate to implement the intent of this ordinance under applicable laws and regulations, and to provide necessary assurances to the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development.
