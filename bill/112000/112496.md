 AN ORDINANCE relating to the City Light Department; approving a fifteen-year franchise for the operation of an electric light and power system by Seattle City Light in the City of Shoreline.

 WHEREAS, Seattle City Light has long provided electric service in the previously unincorporated area of King County which has been incorporated as the City of Shoreline; and

 WHEREAS, Seattle City Light has continued to provide electric service in the City of Shoreline under a series of short-term franchises, the last one of which expired on May 31, 1998; and

 WHEREAS, representatives of Seattle City Light and the City of Shoreline have been meeting on a regular basis since that time to come to agreement on the terms of a long-term franchise which could be implemented at the first of the new year; and

 WHEREAS, with the assistance of the Association of Washington Cities, comprehensive terms of such a long-term franchise have been agreed upon which are acceptable to both the City of Seattle and the City of Shoreline; NOW THEREFORE,

 BE IT ORDAINED BY THE CITY OF SEATTLE AS FOLLOWS:

 Section 1. The City of Seattle hereby approves a franchise for the operation of an electric light and power system by Seattle City Light in the City of Shoreline substantially in the form of Ordinance No. 187 of the City of Shoreline, a copy of which is attached to this ordinance. The Superintendent of the City Light Department is authorized to accept the franchise on Seattle's behalf.

 The franchise with the City of Shoreline has a term of fifteen years beginning on January 1, 1999. Shoreline has agreed that during the term of this franchise it will refrain from exercising its right to create its own municipal electric utility. In consideration for this agreement, Seattle has agreed to pay the City of Shoreline six percent of the power portion of the electric service in Shoreline, and up to six percent of the distribution portion of the electric service upon one year's notice. In addition, Seattle City Light will provide street light service in the City of Shoreline as a component of its electric service to customers in Shoreline.

 Seattle further agrees that the six percent payment on the power portion of the electric service in Shoreline will not be a factor in any rate differential between rates in Shoreline and rates in Seattle, and that any rate differential on the power portion of the rates will not exceed eight percent. Any rate differentials, including differentials based on different operational requirements of the distribution service, will be implemented only as a result of a rate review process conducted by the Seattle City Council. Seattle agrees to appoint a member of its Citizens' Rate Advisory Committee nominated by Shoreline and other suburban cities to represent the interests of suburban cities served in whole or in part by Seattle City Light.

 The franchise provides that the City of Seattle will continue to collect its utility tax on the gross revenues generated by Seattle City Light from providing electric service in the City of Shoreline.

 Section 2. Any acts taken to accomplish the purposes of this ordinance prior to its effective date are hereby ratified and confirmed.

 Section 3. This ordinance shall take effect and be in force thirty (30) days from and after its approval by the Mayor, but if not approved and returned by the Mayor within ten (10) days after presentation, it shall take effect as provided by Municipal Code Section 1.04.020.

 Passed by the City Council the _____ day of ____________, 1998, and signed by me in open session in authentication of its passage this _____ day of _________________, 1998.
