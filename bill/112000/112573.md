 WHEREAS, TCI has entered into a merger agreement, with AT&T Corporation (AT&T), whereby AT&T will assume ownership and control of TCI and its subsidiaries, including the Franchisees; and

 WHEREAS, under the Franchise Agreement, any change in control makes the Franchise subject to the City's revocation unless TCI first obtains the City's consent to the transfer of control; and

 WHEREAS, TCI and AT&T have filed with the City an FCC Form 394, requesting the City's consent to transfer control of TCI and the Franchisees to AT&T; and

 WHEREAS, the City, through its Office of Cable Communications, pursuant to its authority under SMC Ch. 21.60 (the Cable Communications Ordinance), the Franchise Agreement and federal law has requested information from AT&T necessary to evaluate that request; and

 WHEREAS, the City has received from TCI and AT&T information sufficient to make a determination on regarding the transfer of control; and

 WHEREAS, AT&T and TCI state that they are not seeking any modification of the terms and conditions of the Franchise Agreement, as amended, in connection with this transfer; and

 WHEREAS, AT&T and TCI state their intent to cause the Franchisees to comply fully with all franchise provisions and to meet or exceed all applicable and lawful federal, state and local requirements, including but not limited to those relating to rebuild and buildout requirements, customer service standards, Internet access, franchise fees, PEG obligations, and the system's technical standards; and

 WHEREAS, the City has declared its objective, as set forth in the cable franchise and elsewhere, to promote the rapid, full scale, and ubiquitous deployment of broadband cable technologies, so that subscribers may have a wide array of choices for high speed access to the Internet, through both telephone and cable television infrastructure; and

 WHEREAS, the City has sought and received input on the development of policies to achieve that objective, and has received comments from the on-line and Internet service providers, AT&T and TCI representatives, commercial and non- commercial consumers, and the general public; and

 WHEREAS, it is the City of Seattle's goal to ensure its citizens have high speed, open and non-discriminatory access to television signals, the Internet, and other telecommunications services to the extent legally possible; and

 WHEREAS, AT&T and TCI have declared their intent to facilitate the rapid deployment of new technologies and services in the Seattle area; and

 WHEREAS, TCI has agreed, with AT&T's concurrence, to dismiss its appeal of the judgement against it in its litigation against the City's pole attachment ordinance, and will fully satisfy the judgement within 30 days; and

 Section 1. The Mayor is authorized to approve the transfer of control of the franchise, and any amendments and modifications thereto, to operate a cable system in the TCI-1, TCI-II and TCI- III franchise areas, to AT&T Corporation, subject to the following conditions.

 a. AT&T shall cause the Franchisees to comply with all requirements of Seattle Municipal Code 21.60, Franchise Ordinance No. 117956 as amended by Ordinance No. 119183,and all related applicable and lawful orders, contracts, agreements, commitments, side letters, franchise amendments and regulatory actions.

AT&T shall ensure a continued local management presence within King County by maintaining management level positions in network administration, customer service and support, construction engineering, and high speed data services, and support staff sufficient to fulfill all franchise responsibilities.

 c. AT&T and TCI shall cause the Franchisees to comply with all commitments regarding high-speed Internet access as set forth in the Franchise Agreement. In furtherance of these franchise commitments and the City's declared interest in encouraging connectivity, interoperability, and openness among Internet resources, AT&T and TCI shall cause the Franchisees to ensure that the high-speed Internet access services provided over the Franchisees' cable system in Seattle will conform substantially with the following standards:

 (1) The high speed Internet access platform will maintain currency with standards for interoperability with Internet protocol applications.

 (2) Subscribers to the high speed Internet access service affiliated with the Franchisees will be able to reach any and all information on the Internet and will be able to choose to reach information from other sources and through other Internet service providers and on line access providers without viewing content provided by the affiliated high speed Internet access service provider.

 (3) A data network backbone connection will be made to an in- region network access point (commonly referred to as a "carrier hotel,") and interconnection arrangements will be made with local educational and governmental information sources through a coordinated non-profit interconnection point, currently located in the Westin Building if available. Similar interconnection relationships with other Internet service providers and on-line service providers will be established at a suitable interconnection point or points under reasonable terms and conditions acceptable to both parties. Additional backbone connectivity to other national data network backbone providers will be established through interconnection at other backbone connection points within the region, under reasonable terms and conditions acceptable to all parties, including without limitation, requirements that the connecting entity provide its own transport and other necessary equipment.

 d. AT&T and TCI agree that the obligations set forth in Section 1.c may be reopened for resolution under the same procedures for reopening and resolving franchise issues under Sections 20.2 and 20.3 of the Franchise Agreement upon any of the following occurrences:

 (1) If the high speed Internet access service fails to substantially conform with the stated standards;

 (2) If federal law relating to cable-based Internet services is modified by actions of Congress or the Federal Communications Commission, imposing substantially different standards on or affecting the authority of franchising authorities;

 (3) If the Franchisees' high speed Internet access services capture more than two-thirds of the customers served by high- speed Internet access via cable modem and Digital Subscriber Line (DSL) technology in Seattle and the combined market penetration of such services exceeds 35,000 customers in Seattle;

 (4) If any other comparable cable system owned by AT&T/TCI offers direct access to broadband cable modem technology by unaffiliated Internet service providers or on-line service providers on other than a temporary test basis;

 (5) Upon request of AT&T/TCI or the City, to address changes in the law, technology, or the market for high-speed Internet access, that affect the goals of connectivity, interoperability, and openness;

 (6) Upon mutual agreement of the City and AT&T/TCI
