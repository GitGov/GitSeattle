 AN ORDINANCE relating to the Community Development Block Grant Float Loan Program; authorizing a short-term loan of up to One Million Four Hundred Forty Thousand Dollars ($ 1,440,000) in Block Grant funds to Homesight, a Washington nonprofit corporation, for costs of the acquisition of three lots for the Columbia Greenhouse Homeownership Project and certain preconstruction costs.

 WHEREAS, the City Council, by Ordinance 116402, adopted policies for short-term loans of Community Development Block Grant ("CDBG") funds, known as "CD Float Loans"; and

 WHEREAS, the City's Director of the Office of Economic Development has identified a project in which the City would provide a short term loan (the "Loan") to Homesight for costs of acquisition of three lots to develop housing for homeownership, of which at least 51% of the homes will be sold to low- and moderate-income households, and for certain preconstruction costs of such housing; and

 WHEREAS, the development will benefit low- and moderate-income persons, which will satisfy the CD Float Loan policies, and the City's Loan Committee has approved the proposed Loan in accordance with those policies; and

 WHEREAS, Homesight is a Community Based Development Organization and is developing a project within a Neighborhood Revitalization Area; and

 WHEREAS, the project is a neighborhood revitalization project that will have an impact on the decline of an area within Southeast Seattle designated by the City as a Homeownership Zone, which satisfies the CDBG eligibility requirement; and

 WHEREAS, the City Council, by Resolution 29629, adopted policies to promote homeownership programs within HUD-authorized Homeownership Zones; and

 WHEREAS, the making of the proposed Loan will not impair the implementation of other projects or programs of the City using CDBG funds; NOW, THEREFORE,

The Director of the Office of Economic Development ("OED Director") is authorized, for and on behalf of The City of Seattle, to lend up to ONE MILLION FOUR HUNDRED FORTY THOUSAND DOLLARS ($1,440,000) of CDBG funds (which may include available CDBG program income), subject to receipt of sufficient funds from HUD (together with any available program income), to Homesight, a Washington nonprofit corporation, for costs of acquisition of three lots for the Columbia Greenhouse Homeownership Project located between 32nd Avenue South and 35th Avenue South in Southeast Seattle, and CDBG-eligible preconstruction costs, subject to the terms and conditions stated in this ordinance. The amount of up to ONE MILLION FOUR HUNDRED FORTY THOUSAND DOLLARS ($1,440,000) is hereby appropriated from the Housing and Community Development Revenue Sharing Fund for such purpose.

 Section 2. The Loan shall be payable upon the earlier of (i) twenty-four (24) months or (ii) demand by the City. The Loan shall bear interest at an appropriate rate to be determined by the OED Director, not to exceed four percent (4%) per annum. Interest shall be payable monthly, or on such schedule as the OED Director determines is appropriate. The OED Director may require a loan fee from Homesight, payable to the City, not to exceed 1.0 % of the maximum Loan amount, which fee shall be deposited in the Housing and Community Development Revenue Sharing Fund. The OED Director is authorized to cause all or a portion of such fee to be (a) paid to the National Development Council ("NDC") in accordance with an existing contract under which NDC develops and facilitates eligible CD Float Loan projects; (b) applied to legal and other costs related to the administration of the transaction authorized by this ordinance; and/or (c) applied to payment of expenses incurred in the administration of any federally funded economic development loan projects or programs administered by the OED Director. The amount of up to FOURTEEN THOUSAND FOUR HUNDRED DOLLARS ($14,400) is hereby appropriated for such purposes from the Housing and Community Development Revenue Sharing Fund, subject to receipt of such funds in payment of the loan fee.

 Section 3. The Loan shall be secured by an irrevocable letter of credit that shall have an outstanding balance, at all times, at least equal to the outstanding principal amount and accrued interest, plus all additional interest that will accrue for the next 30 days. The letter of credit shall be issued by a commercial bank satisfactory to the OED Director and shall be in form and content satisfactory to the OED Director.

 Section 4. Disbursement of the Loan shall be conditioned upon satisfactory environmental review in accordance with HUD requirements, and upon other conditions required by law or deemed appropriate by the OED Director.

 Section 5. The OED Director is hereby authorized to execute, deliver, accept, administer, modify and enforce, as appropriate, for and on behalf of the City, a Loan Agreement and Promissory Note, evidencing the CD Float Loan authorized hereby, based upon the forms attached hereto as Exhibits A and B with such insertions, additions and revisions as she shall deem appropriate to implement the intent of this ordinance.

 Section 6. The OED Director is hereby authorized to take such other actions and execute and deliver such other documents as shall be reasonably necessary or appropriate to carry out the intent of this Ordinance.

 Section 7. Payments of interest on the Loan and principal repayments shall be deposited in the Housing and Community Development Revenue Sharing Fund, and may be expended pursuant to any past or future appropriations of CDBG funds, whether in the annual budget or otherwise, unless such other appropriations are limited by their express terms to CDBG program income from other programs.

 Section 8. The Director of the Department of Housing and Human Services is authorized to amend the City of Seattle's Consolidated Plan and to take such other actions as are appropriate to implement the intent of this ordinance under HUD regulations,

 and to provide necessary assurances to the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development.

 Section 9. Any act pursuant to the authority and prior to the effective date of this ordinance is hereby ratified and confirmed.
