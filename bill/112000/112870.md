 Legislation Title:

 AN ORDINANCE relating to the Office of Economic Development, appropriating interest earned on an Enterprise Community grant accepted under Ordinance 117944 for Enterprise Community programs.

 Summary of the Legislation:

 In 1995, the City of Seattle was designated as a federal

 Community (EC) and awarded a $2.847 million grant to implement community development

 activities identified in an application. Grant funds were deposited into an interest-bearing

 General Fund account. Interest income was also intended to support EC activity.

 OED has received ordinance authority appropriating up to $100,000 of interest income

 for EC activities. Actual interest earnings have exceeded this amount and another ordinance

 Is needed to appropriate the balance of interest earnings to EC activities.

 Background (Include justification for the legislation and funding history, if applicable):

 Previous ordinances authorized the acceptance of the initial EC grant award and work program. A

 second ordinance appropriated up to $100,000 of interest earnings from the grant to continued EC

 activities. Interest earnings have exceeded the $100,000 appropriation so this ordinance

 appropriates the balance of interest earnings for EC-eligible activities.

 Sustainability Issues (related to grant awards):

 No staff increases are projected. City commitments have not been made to continue EC-funded

 activity once the grant award is exhausted. Some activities may seek continued funding through

 other community development fund sources, such as CDBG.
