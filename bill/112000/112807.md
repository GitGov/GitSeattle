 AN ORDINANCE amending the Fair Housing Practices Ordinance to provide for a private cause of action for claims of discrimination in relation to places of public accommodation.

 WHEREAS, it has been the policy of the City of Seattle, since 1973, to prohibit discrimination with respect to public accommodations on the grounds of race, color, sex, marital status, sexual orientation, political ideology, age, creed, religion, ancestry, national origin, or the presence of any sensory, mental or physical disability. The City Council finds that discrimination on these grounds has continued to occur and that the provision of a private right of action will likely deter such discrimination. Chapter 14.08 of the Seattle Municipal Code is accordingly amended to provide for the filing of private actions in a court of competent jurisdiction as set forth in the following provisions,

 NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT ORDAINED BY THE CITY OF SEATTLE AS FOLLOWS:

 Section autonum 1. SMC 14.08.095 is hereby amended as follows: SMC 14.08.095 Enforcement by private persons. A. Any person who claims to have been injured by an unfair ((real estate)) practice under this chapter, or who believes that he or she will be injured by such an unfair ((real estate)) practice that is about to occur, may commence a civil action in a court of competent jurisdiction((King County Superior Court)) not later than ((one (1))) three (3) years after the occurrence or the termination of an alleged unfair ((real estate)) practice or ninety (90) days after a determination of reasonable cause by the Director, whichever occurs last, to obtain appropriate relief with respect to such unfair ((real estate)) practice.

 ((B. The computation of such one-year period shall not include any time during which an administrative proceeding under this chapter was pending with respect to a complaint or charge under this chapter alleging an unfair ((real estate)) practice based on the same facts or occurrences.))

 ((C.))B. A complaint may be filed under this section whether or not an administrative charge has been filed under SMC Section 14.08.100, and without regard to the status of such charge, but if the Department or the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development has obtained a pre-finding or post-finding settlement or conciliation agreement with the consent of the charging party, no action may be filed under this section with respect to the alleged unfair practice which forms the basis for such complaint except for the purpose of enforcing the terms of such agreement.

 ((D. No civil action may be commenced under this section with respect to an alleged unfair real estate practice which forms the basis of a complaint if a hearing on the record has been commenced by the City of Seattle Office of the Hearing Examiner.))

 C. Any aggrieved person may intervene as of right in the civil action. For purposes of this subsection, "aggrieved person" means a person who claims to have been injured by, or believes that he or she will be injured by, an unfair practice that is the subject matter of the civil action.

 D. (1) Subject to the provisions of subsection D(2), upon the filing of a civil action involving the same claim or arising from the same facts and circumstances, whether under this subchapter or similar law, a charge of an unfair practice may be administratively closed by the Director.

 (2) In the event that a court dismisses a private cause of action on grounds that would not preclude pursuit of a charge under this subchapter, the charging party may request, within 90 days of the entry of the Court's order of dismissal, that the Department reopen a previously filed charge. Upon such request, the Director may reopen a case that was administratively closed upon the filing of a civil action. If the Department closes a case based on a "no reasonable cause" finding, the case shall not be reopened except as provided through appeal pursuant to SMC 14.08.150.

 (3) No complainant or aggrieved person may secure relief from more than one governmental agency, instrumentality or tribunal for the same harm or injury.

 (4) Where the complainant or aggrieved person elects to pursue simultaneous claims in more than one forum, the factual and legal determinations issued by the first tribunal to rule on the claims may, under the doctrines of "res judicata" or "collateral estoppel," be binding on all or portions of the claims pending before other tribunals.

 (5) No civil action may be commenced under this section with respect to an alleged unfair practice which forms the basis of a complaint if a hearing on the record has been commenced by the City of Seattle Office of the Hearing Examiner. To preclude such filing, a charging party must be provided with written notice at least 30 days prior to the commencement of a hearing before the City of Seattle Office of the Hearing Examiner that the commencement of such a hearing will terminate the charging party's right to file a civil action.

 E. In a civil action under this section, if the court finds that an unfair ((real estate)) practice has occurred or is about to occur, the court may grant as relief, as it deems appropriate, any permanent or temporary injunction, temporary restraining order, or other order, including an order enjoining the defendant from engaging in such practice or ordering such affirmative action as may be appropriate. The court may also award actual damages, including damages for humiliation and mental suffering, and any other appropriate remedy set forth in the Federal Fair Housing Amendments Act (P.L. 100-430). The court may also allow reasonable attorney's fees and costs to the prevailing party. Damages awarded under this section for humiliation and mental suffering are only subject to the limitation of SMC Section 14.08.160(A) or SMC 14.04.180(C) if the charges upon which the court awarded such damages allege an unfair practice with respect to public accommodations.

 F. If monetary relief is sought for the benefit of a person who could have intervened under subsection C of this section, but who did not intervene in the civil action, the court shall not award such relief if that person has not complied with discovery orders entered by the court. Attorney fees and costs may be assessed against a person who intervenes by filing a notice of independent appearance in the civil action only to the extent that the intervening participation was frivolous or vexatious, or was for the purpose of harassment.

 ((F.))G. Relief granted under this section shall not affect any contract, sale, encumbrance, or lease consummated before the granting of such relief and involving a bona fide purchaser, encumbrancer, or tenant, without actual notice of the filing of a charge or civil action under this chapter.

 ((G.))H. Upon timely application, the City Attorney may intervene in such civil action, if the City Attorney certifies that the case is of general public importance, and may obtain such relief as would be available in an action brought under SMC Section 14.08.((165))095.

 I. It is the intent of the City of Seattle, in enacting this section, to provide private judicial remedies for violations of this chapter that are as expansive as possible consistent with the powers granted by the Constitution and Laws of the State of Washington. In the event that any provision or aspect of this section is adjudicated to be invalid or unenforceable under applicable law, the validity or enforceability of the remaining provisions shall be unaffected.

 Section autonum 2. SMC 14.08.165 is hereby amended as follows: SMC 14.08.165 Election of civil action after unsuccessful conciliation(( in cases of unfair real estate practices)). A. Following the issuance of a finding of unsuccessful conciliation, any charging party on whose behalf the reasonable cause finding was made, or a respondent, may, with respect to an unfair ((real estate)) practice under this chapter, elect to have the claims on which reasonable cause was found decided in a civil action under ((this section)) SMC section 14.08.095 in lieu of an administrative hearing under SMC Sections 14.08.170 and 14.08.180. This election must be made not later than ((twenty (20))) ninety (90) days after issuance of the finding of unsuccessful conciliation. The person making such election shall give notice of doing so to the Department and to all other charging parties and respondents to whom the charge relates.

 B. If an election is made under subsection A of this section, the City Attorney shall commence, within thirty (30) days after the election is made, a civil action in the King County Superior Court to decide on the claim.

 ((C. Any aggrieved person may intervene as of right in the civil action. For purposes of this subsection, "aggrieved person" means a person who claims to have been injured by, or believes that he or she will be injured by, an unfair real estate practice that is the subject matter of the civil action.

 D. In a civil action under this section, if the court finds that an unfair real estate practice has occurred or is about to occur, the court may grant any relief including but not limited to actual damages, injunctive or equitable relief, and any other appropriate remedy set forth in the Federal Fair Housing Amendments Act (P.L. 100- 430). The court may also assess a civil penalty as set forth in SMC Section 14.08.185. If monetary relief is sought for the benefit of a person who could have intervened under subsection C of this section, but who did not intervene in the civil action, the court shall not award such relief if that person has not complied with discovery orders entered by the court.

 E. In any proceeding under this section, the court may award attorney fees and costs to the prevailing party. Attorney fees and costs may be assessed against a person who intervenes by filing a notice of independent appearance in the civil action only to the extent that the intervening participation was frivolous or vexatious, or was for the purpose of harassment.))

 Section autonum 3. SMC 14.08.185 is hereby amended as follows:

 SMC 14.08.185 Civil penalty in cases alleging unfair ((real estate)) practices.

 A. In cases alleging unfair ((real estate)) practices filed under this chapter, in addition to any other award of damages or grant of injunctive relief, a civil penalty may be assessed against the respondent. Payment of the civil penalty may be required as a term of a conciliation agreement entered into under SMC Section 14.08.160A, or may be ordered by the Hearing Examiner (or panel majority) in a decision rendered under SMC Section 14.08.180 or by a court of competent jurisdiction in a proceeding filed under SMC Section 14.08.165 or 14.08.095.

 B. The civil penalty assessed against a respondent shall not exceed the following amount:

 1. Ten Thousand Dollars ($10,000.00) if the respondent has not been determined to have committed any prior unfair ((real estate)) practice;

 2. Twenty-five Thousand Dollars ($25,000.00) if the respondent has been determined to have committed one (1) other unfair ((real estate)) practice during the five (5) year period ending on the date of the filing of this charge; or

 3. Fifty Thousand Dollars ($50,000.00) if the respondent has been determined to have committed two (2) or more unfair ((real estate)) practices during the seven (7) year period ending on the date of the filing of this charge; except that if acts constituting the unfair ((real estate)) practice that is the subject of the charge are committed by the same natural person who has been previously determined to have committed acts constituting an unfair ((real estate)) practice, then the civil penalties set forth in subparagraphs 2 and 3 of subsection B of this section may be imposed without regard to the period of time within which those prior acts occurred. For purposes of this section, "unfair ((real estate)) practice" shall include, without limitation, any violation of SMC Sections 14.08.040(A) or (B) or (D); 14.08.050;

 14.08.060; ((14.08.170)) 14.08.070(A) or (B); or ((14.08.180)) 14.08.080; as in effect at the time of the violation, whether or not the violation was then deemed an "unfair ((real estate)) practice" under such section.

 Section autonum 3. This ordinance shall take effect and be in force thirty (30) days from and after its approval by the Mayor, but if not approved and returned by the Mayor within ten (10) days after presentation, it shall take effect as provided by Municipal Code Section 1.04.020.
