That Section 12 of Ordinance 96719 is hereby amended to read as follows: Section 12. ~~So long as the permittee, shall exercise any privilege or authority granted by this ordinance, it shall provide and maintain in full force and effect, public liability insurance in connection with the construction, operation, maintenance and use of the steam mains and appurtenances herein authorized, with the City as an additional insured, providing for a limit of not less than One Hundred Thousand Dollars ($100,000), for all damages arising out of bodily injuries to or death of one person, subject to that limit for each person, a total limit of not less than Three Hundred Thousand Dollars ($300,000),for all damages arising out of bodily injuries to or death of two or more persons in any one accident; and property damage liability insurance providing for a limit of less than Fifty Thousand Dollars ($50.0000, for all damages arising out injury to or destruction of property in any one accident; Provided, however, that whenever in the judgment of the Mayor of the City of Seattle, such public liability insurance filed pursuant to the provisions hereof shall be deemed insufficient to fully protect The City of Seattle, the permittee, its successors or assigns, shall upon demand by the Mayor, furnish additional insurance in such amount as mey be~~specified by said Mayor. A copy of such policy or certificate evidencing the same shall be filed in the office of the City Comptroller prior to construction pursuant to this ordinance or other use of

 said streets and shall provide for ten (10) days notice to the City of any change, cancellation

~~or lapse thereof.~~

For as long as the Permittee, its successors and assigns, shall exercise any permission granted by this ordinance and until the steam mains and appurtenances are entirely removed from their location as described in Section 1 or until discharged by order of the Director of Seattle Transportation, the Permittee shall obtain and maintain in full force and effect, at its own expense, insurance policies which protect the City from any and all claims and risks in conjunction with:

Evidence of current coverage shall be submitted to the City in the form of a copy of the full insurance policy with all endorsements attached thereto, and is a condition to the validity of this permit.

 Whenever in the judgment of the Risk Manager of The City of Seattle, such insurance filed pursuant to the provisions hereof shall be deemed insufficient to fully protect The City of Seattle,
