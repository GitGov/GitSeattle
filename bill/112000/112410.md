 ORDINANCE __________________

 AN ORDINANCE relating to the Seattle Center Department; authorizing the Seattle Center Director to enter into co-promotion agreements under specified circumstances for spectator events in KeyArena[HH1].

 WHEREAS, the vision of Seattle Center is to be the nation's best gathering place and to be financially successful through entrepreneurial spirit and public stewardship; and

 WHEREAS, the vision for KeyArena is to be the best sports and entertainment arena in the country, offering a broad, exciting mix of sports, concerts, family shows and special events to regional audiences; and

 WHEREAS, three of the goals for KeyArena are to 1) exceed the guarantee of 125 events offered to certain suiteholders, 2) maintain a diverse event mix to satisfy the largest possible audiences of the Pacific Northwest, and 3) to improve its competitive position in the market; and

 WHEREAS, new incentives are needed to attract new business to the facility; and

 WHEREAS, co-promotion is desired by many promoters in the touring spectator event industry;

 NOW THEREFORE,

 BE IT ORDAINED BY THE CITY OF SEATTLE AS FOLLOWS:

 Section 1. The Director of Seattle Center is authorized to enter into co-promotion agreements for spectator events in KeyArena for which admission is charged. In lieu of licensing fees, actual expenses and revenues shall be used to determine the allocation of gross proceeds between the City and the co-promoter. Such co- promotion agreements may include provisions under which the Seattle Center agrees to share in the profits and losses associated with the event provided the following criteria are met:

 The KeyArena suiteholders to whom the City has a contractual obligation to provide a minimum number of events per year are allowed access to the event.

 The profit-sharing arrangement shall be in accord with sound management practices and shall fulfill a declared objective furthering a departmental purpose such as but not limited to acquainting the public with the facility, thereby establishing or increasing public usage; reaching out to people who would not otherwise make use of the facility; or broadening the variety of events offered to the public.

 There is a reasonable expectation that the Seattle Center will recover all direct costs associated with the event, taking into account anticipated ticket prices and sales, the history of the costs and revenues associated with the event or a like event and the experience and qualifications of co-promoters; provided that this expectation may be balanced against the cost of reimbursing suiteholders for holding an insufficient number of events, and against other goals for KeyArena or other City goals.

 The co-promotion must avoid the use of public facilities for electoral purposes prohibited by RCW 42.17.130 and must comply with all other applicable laws.

 The opportunity to co-promote an event shall be made available to individuals, associations, and businesses, similarly situated, on an equal basis, in accord with and subject to the aforesaid conditions and the Director's rules.

 Section 2. The Director of Seattle Center, without further legislative action, shall establish through rules adopted pursuant to SMC Ch. 3.02, a co-promotion policy that includes booking priorities and types of spectator events that will be considered for co-promotion agreements.

 Section 3. The Director of Seattle Center shall have the authority to prepare co-promotion agreements with the guidance of the Law Department and Risk Manager and in accordance with all applicable City of Seattle ordinances, in any format considered appropriate by said Director.

 Section 4. The Director of Seattle Center shall prepare and submit semi-annual reports to the City Council identifying all co- promotional events which have occurred during the preceding six months and associated revenues and expenses.

 Section 5. Any act consistent with the authority, but prior to the effective date of this ordinance is hereby ratified and confirmed.

 Section 6. This ordinance shall take effect and be in force thirty (30) days from and after its approval by the Mayor, but if not approved and returned by the Mayor within ten (10) days after presentation, it shall take effect as provided by Municipal Code Section 1.04.020.

 Passed by the City Council the _____ day of _______________, 1998, and signed by me in open session in authentication of its passage this _____ day of _______________, 1998. ___________________________________ President of the City Council
