 AN ORDINANCE relating to land use and zoning; amending Chapter 23.34 of the Seattle Municipal Code to correct inadvertent text omissions in Ordinance 119403 that would have amended Lowrise 3 and 4 rezone evaluation criteria as proposed by the Queen Anne Neighborhood Plan.

 WHEREAS, after substantial public review the City Council adopted Ordinance 119403 that incorporated portions of the Queen Anne Neighborhood Plan into the Comprehensive Plan, and sought to amend SMC Chapter 23.34 to exempt the Upper Queen Anne Residential Urban Village from certain rezone evaluation criteria regarding rezones of land to the Lowrise 3 and Lowrise 4 designations; and

 WHEREAS, notice as required by the Land Use Code, Chapter 23.76 was given concerning the proposed amendments to Chapter 23.34, and a public hearing was held on October 7, 1998; and

 WHEREAS, the City Council by Ordinance 119403 adopted a Comprehensive Plan policy calling for the exemption the Upper Queen Anne Residential Urban Village from certain rezone evaluation criteria regarding rezones of land to the Lowrise 3 and Lowrise 4 designations; and

 WHEREAS, text that was intended to amend the Land Use Code was inadvertently omitted from the ordinance;

 NOW THEREFORE,

 BE IT ORDAINED BY THE CITY OF SEATTLE AS FOLLOWS:

 Section 1. Subsection B of Section 23.34.020 of the Seattle Municipal Code, as last amended by Ordinance 119403, is further amended as follows:

 B. Locational Criteria.

 1. Threshold Conditions. Subject to subsection B2 of this section, properties that may be considered for an L3 designation are limited to the following:

 a. Properties already zoned L3;

 b. Properties in areas already developed predominantly to the permitted L3 density and where L3 scale is well established; or

 c. Properties within an urban center or village, except as provided in this subsection below, where less emphasis shall be placed on density and scale compatibility with existing development, when the designation will be consistent with the densities required for the center or village category as established in Section B of the Land Use Element of the Comprehensive Plan, unless otherwise indicated by a neighborhood plan adopted or amended by the City Council after January 1, 1995. This subsection ~~B(1)~~ )) c. shall not apply in the Wallingford Residential Urban Village, ~~or~~ in the Eastlake Residential Urban Village, or in the Upper Queen Anne Residential Urban Village.

 2. Properties designated as environmentally critical may not be rezoned to an L3 designation, and may remain L3 only in areas predominantly developed to the intensity of the L3 zone.

 3. Other Criteria. The Lowrise 3 zone designation is most appropriate in areas generally characterized by the following:

 a. Development Characteristics of the Area.

 (1) Either:

 (a) Areas that are already developed predominantly to the permitted L3 density and where L3 scale is well established, or

 (b) Areas that are within an urban center or urban village, except as provided in this subsection below, where less emphasis shall be placed on density and scale compatibility with existing development, when the designation will be consistent with the densities required for the center or village category as established in Section B of the Land Use Element of the Comprehensive Plan, unless otherwise indicated by a neighborhood plan adopted or amended by the City Council after January 1, 1995. This subsection (( ~~B3a(1)~~ ))(b) shall not apply in the Wallingford Residential Urban Village, ~~or~~ in the Eastlake Residential Urban Village, or in the Upper Queen Anne Residential Urban Village.

 (2) Areas where the street pattern provides for adequate vehicular circulation and access to sites. Locations with alleys are preferred. Street widths should be sufficient for two (2) way traffic and parking along at least one (1) curbside.

 b. Relationship to the Surrounding Areas.

 (1) Properties in areas that are well served by public transit and have direct access to arterials, so that vehicular traffic is not required to use streets that pass through less intensive residential zones;

 (2) Properties in areas with significant topographic breaks, major arterials or open space that provide sufficient transition to LDT or L1 multifamily development;

 (3) Properties in areas with existing multifamily zoning with close proximity and pedestrian connections to neighborhood services, public open spaces, schools and other residential amenities;

 (4) Properties that are adjacent to business and commercial areas with comparable height and bulk, or where a transition in scale between areas of larger multifamily and/or commercial structures and smaller multifamily development is desirable.

 Section 2. Subsection B of Section 23.34.022 of the Seattle Municipal Code, as last amended by Ordinance 119403, is further amended as follows:

 B. Locational Criteria.

 1. Threshold Conditions. Subject to subsection B2 of this section, properties that may be considered for an L4 designation are limited to the following:

 a. Properties already zoned L4;

 b. Properties in areas already developed predominantly to the permitted L4 density and where L4 scale is well established; or

 c. Properties within an urban center or urban village, except as provided in this subsection below, where less emphasis shall be placed on density and scale compatibility with existing development, when the designation will be consistent with the densities required for the center or village category as established in Section B of the Land Use Element of the Comprehensive Plan, unless otherwise indicated by a neighborhood plan adopted or amended by the City Council after January 1, 1995. This subsection ~~B1~~c. shall not apply in the Wallingford Residential Urban Village, ~~or~~ in the Eastlake Residential Urban Village, or in the Upper Queen Anne Residential Urban Village.

 2. Properties designated as environmentally critical may not be rezoned to an L4 designation, and may remain L4 only in areas predominantly developed to the intensity of the L4 zone.

 3. Other Criteria. The Lowrise 4 zone designation is most appropriate in areas generally characterized by the following:

 a. Development Characteristics of the Area.

 (1) Either:

 (a) Areas that are already developed predominantly to the permitted L4 density and where L4 scale is well established, or

 (b) Areas that are within an urban center or urban village, except as provided in this subsection below, where less emphasis shall be placed on density and scale compatibility with existing development, when the designation will be consistent with the densities required for the center or village category as established in Section B of the Land Use Element of the Comprehensive Plan, unless otherwise indicated by a neighborhood plan adopted or amended by the City Council after January 1, 1995. This subsection ~~B3a(1)~~ ))(b) shall not apply in the Wallingford Residential Urban Village, ~~or~~ in the Eastlake Residential Urban Village, or in the Upper Queen Anne Residential Urban Village.

 (2) Areas of sufficient size to promote a high quality, higher density residential environment where there is good pedestrian access to amenities;

 (3) Areas generally platted with alleys that can provide access to parking, allowing the street frontage to remain uninterrupted by driveways, thereby promoting a street environment better suited to the level of pedestrian activity associated with higher density residential environments;

 (4) Areas with good internal vehicular circulation, and good access to sites, preferably from alleys. Generally, the width of principal streets in the area should be sufficient to allow for two (2) way traffic and parking along at least one (1) curbside.

 b. Relationship to the Surrounding Areas.

 (1) Properties in areas adjacent to concentrations of employment;

 (2) Properties in areas that are directly accessible to regional transportation facilities, especially transit, providing connections to major employment centers, including arterials where transit service is good to excellent and street capacity is sufficient to accommodate traffic generated by higher density development. Vehicular access to the area should not require use of streets passing through less intensive residential areas;

 (3) Properties with close proximity and with good pedestrian connections to services in neighborhood commercial areas, public open spaces and other residential amenities;

 (4) Properties with well-defined edges providing sufficient separation from adjacent areas of small scale residential development, or where such areas are separated by zones providing a transition in the height, scale and density of development.

 Section 3. This ordinance shall take effect and be in force thirty (30) days from and after its approval by the Mayor, but if not approved and returned by the Mayor within ten (10) days after presentation, it shall take effect as provided by Municipal Code Section 1.04.020.
