 AN ORDINANCE relating to the Delridge Neighborhood Plan; amending the Seattle Comprehensive Plan to incorporate portions of the Delridge Neighborhood Plan; and repealing previous neighborhood plans.

 WHEREAS, on July 25, 1994, by Ordinance 117221, the City Council adopted the Seattle Comprehensive Plan, which includes a neighborhood planning element; and

 WHEREAS, City Council Resolution 28966, adopted August 1, 1994, established a Neighborhood Planning Program for the City of Seattle; and

 WHEREAS, the Neighborhood Planning program provided that distressed areas, as well as designated Urban Centers, Urban Villages and Manufacturing/Industrial Centers, were eligible for funding and support through this program; and

 WHEREAS, the Delridge Community was found to meet the Neighborhood Planning Office's program criteria for participation in the planning process because it was a distressed area and therefore declared eligible for funding and support through this program; and

 WHEREAS, a coalition of Delridge neighborhood citizens came together to form the Delridge Planning Committee in 1996 for the purpose of preparing a neighborhood plan as provided for in the City of Seattle Comprehensive Plan; and

 WHEREAS, the Delridge Planning Committee convened regular meetings open to everyone and regularly attended by community citizens throughout the next three years; and

 WHEREAS, the Delridge Planning Committee conducted an extensive phase I outreach process featuring community meetings and workshops to develop a vision for the community of Delridge, identify key issues and establish planning boundaries; and

 WHEREAS, this outreach process also led to public involvement that was representative of the diverse community and a list of priority planning topics which led to selection of members for a planning committee to lead phase II planning; and

 WHEREAS, consultants were hired to study and prepare analyses and recommendations on integrating the community with nature, creating concentrated nodes of activity, improving transportation, housing, community and culture, economic development, and West Seattle wide issues; and

 WHEREAS, a final plan incorporating key strategies and additional activities for implementation was completed, reviewed and approved by the planning committee and validated by the community in response to a community-wide mailer and validation meeting; and

 WHEREAS, the neighborhood planning areas of West Seattle collaborated on a joint effort to develop a human development proposal and a comprehensive "action plan" of transportation system improvements and actions; and

 WHEREAS, the Delridge Neighborhood Plan is consistent with the goals and policies of Seattle's Comprehensive Plan; and

 WHEREAS, a SEPA checklist has been prepared and a Determination of Non-Significance issued on June 3, 1999; and

 WHEREAS, the Council finds that the proposed amendments are consistent with the Growth Management Act, and will protect and promote the health, safety and welfare of the general public;
