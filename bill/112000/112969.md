 WHEREAS, Ordinance 118821, passed by the Council in 1997, incorporated goals and policies relating to tree preservation and enhancement into the City's Comprehensive Plan, including the policy to "encourage the preservation and maintenance of existing healthy tree cover in areas undergoing development, and consider tree replacement if removal is unavoidable" (Comprehensive Plan Policy L206); and

 1. Trees shall be required when single-family dwelling units are constructed. The minimum number of caliper inches of tree required per lot may be met through using either the tree preservation option or tree planting option set forth below, or through a combination of preservation and planting. This requirement may be met by planting or preserving street trees in the public right-of-way.

 a. Tree preservation option. For lots over three thousand (3000) square feet, at least two (2) caliper inches of existing tree per one thousand (1000) square feet of lot area must be preserved. On lots that are three thousand (3000) square feet or smaller, at least three (3) caliper inches of existing tree must be preserved per lot. When this option is used, a tree preservation plan is required.

 b. Tree planting option. For lots over three thousand (3000) square feet, at least two (2) caliper inches of tree per one thousand (1000) square feet of lot area must be planted. On lots that are three thousand (3000) square feet or smaller, at least three (3) caliper inches of tree must be planted per lot.

 2. Tree measurements. Trees planted to meet the requirements in 1) above shall be at least one and one-half (1.5) inches in diameter. The diameter of new trees shall be measured (in caliper inches) six (6)-inches above the ground. Existing trees shall be measured four and one-half (4.5) feet above the ground. When an existing tree is three (3) to ten (10) inches in diameter, each one (1)-inch counts as one (1) inch toward meeting the tree requirements in 1) above. When an existing tree is more than ten (10) inches in diameter, each one (1)-inch of the tree that is over ten (10) inches shall count as three (3) inches toward meeting the tree requirement.

 3. Tree preservation plans. If the tree preservation option is chosen, a tree preservation plan must be submitted and approved. Tree preservation plans shall provide for protection of trees during construction according to standards promulgated by the Department of Design, Construction and Land Use.
