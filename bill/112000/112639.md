 AN ORDINANCE relating to land use and zoning of adult cabarets, extending the moratorium on the issuance of use permits, and on the acceptance of applications for use permits or building permits, for adult entertainment premises as defined in SMC 6.270.

 BE IT ORDAINED BY THE CITY OF SEATTLE AS FOLLOWS:

 Section 1. The City Council hereby adopts the following findings of fact:

 a. There are a number of adult cabarets located near residential areas throughout the City;

 b. There is growing evidence that such uses constitute a threat to the public health, safety, and welfare;

 c. In May 1998 the City Council passed and the Mayor signed Ordinance 119001 establishing a moratorium through June 30, 1999 on new adult cabarets within the City pending additional City analysis and evaluation;

 d. The City has been following, and will continue to monitor, activities in Cincinnati, Ohio and surrounding municipalities regarding zoning and other regulations governing adult entertainment establishments with an eye toward learning from their experience;

 e. The City Council has developed a work plan for developing and evaluating land use code amendments for adult entertainment uses; and

 f. This Council therefore finds that the protection of the public health, safety, and welfare requires extending the moratorium on new adult cabarets.

 Section 2. Through June 30, 2000 or until new land use regulations governing the location of adult cabarets take effect, whichever is sooner, no use permit shall be issued, nor shall any use permit application or building permit application be accepted, for any new adult entertainment premises as defined in SMC 6.270.

 Section 3. Pursuant to SMC 25.05.880, the City Council finds that an exemption under SEPA for this action is necessary to prevent an imminent threat to public health and safety and to prevent an imminent threat of serious environmental degradation through continued development under the existing regulations. SEPA review of any permanent regulations proposed for replacement of the existing zoning shall be conducted.

 Section 4. This Ordinance shall take effect and be in force thirty days from and after its passage and approval, if approved by the Mayor; otherwise it shall take effect at the time it shall become a law under the provisions of the city charter.

 PASSED by the City Council the ______ day of ______________, 1999, and signed by me in open session in authentication of its passage this ______ day of ______________, 1999. ________________________________________ President ...................... of the City Council

 Approved by me this ________ day of ______________, 1999. ________________________________________ Mayor

 Filed by me this ________ day of ______________, 1999. ________________________________________ City Clerk 4/5/99 v.1
