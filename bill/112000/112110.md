 AN ORDINANCE relating to land use and zoning, amending Sections 23.12.120, 23.69.006, and 23.69.032 of the Seattle Municipal Code to implement the 1998 Agreement Between the City of Seattle and the University of Washington.

 BE IT ORDAINED BY THE CITY OF SEATTLE AS FOLLOWS:

 Section 1. Policy 6 of Section 23.12.120 of the Seattle Municipal Code (SMC), which Section was last amended by Ordinance 118362, is further amended as follows:

 23.12.120 Major institution policies.

 Policy 6: Transition Provisions

 Major Institution Master Plans and other Major Institution development agreements adopted prior to these policies shall remain in effect under the conditions of adoption or until such time as they are amended or superseded under the provisions of these policies.

 For master plans subject to the regulations in effect before the effective date of the regulations adopted as part of the 1996 Major Institutions Ordinance, development program components of adopted master plans shall expire.

 Where a specific expiration date is not established in a master plan, the expiration date shall be ten years from May 2, 1990, the effective date of the Land Use Code regulations implementing these policies.

 Non-contiguous areas of Major Institutions with adopted master plans shall be included in the MIO designation until any major amendment or new master plan. A provision shall be included in the master plan major amendment or new master plan to delete the non-contiguous areas from the overlay designation, unless the non-contiguous areas were once separate Major Institutions. This deletion of non-contiguous areas shall not be subject to Policy 5: Rezones. It shall be processed as a City-initiated amendment to the Official Land Use Map to implement new land use policies adopted by resolution, which is a Type V Council land use decision.

 Applications may be made and permits issued for any individual development project which would not require an adopted master plan under these policies.

~~University of Washington~~

~~The Joint Statement of Goals and Policies of the City of Seattle and the University of Washington, as adopted by the Seattle City Council on May 23, 1977, and the University of Washington Board of Regents on May 13, 1977, and subsequently amended, shall continue to serve as an applicable policy and implementation guideline for the University of Washington until amended.~~

~~The Joint Statement was amended by the Agreement Between the City of Seattle and the University of Washington, May 2, 1983, which includes the requirement for a master plan. The master plan provisions and procedures for the University of Washington shall be in accordance with Section II, Master Plan and Cumulative Impacts, of the City- University Agreement.~~

 Section 2. A new Policy 7 is added to Section 23.12.120 of the SMC, which Section was last amended by Ordinance 118362, as follows:

Policy 7: University of Washington.

 Beginning in 1983, the City of Seattle and the University of Washington have entered into sequential agreements which, along with other applicable legislation, have governed development on the University's campus and in an area surrounding the campus called the Primary and Secondary Impact Zones. The 1998 Agreement Between the City of Seattle and University of Washington authorized by Ordinance _________ (Council Bill _________) describes the master plan process (formulation, approval and amendment), off-campus land acquisition and leasing, membership and responsibilities of the City-University- Community Advisory Committee, transportation policies, coordinated traffic planning for special events, permit acquisition and conditioning, relationship of the current and future master plans to the Agreement, zoning and environmental review authority, resolution of disputes, and amendment or termination of the Agreement itself. The 1998 Agreement or its successor shall govern relations between the City and the University of Washington.

Within the Major Institution Overlay (MIO) boundaries for the University of Washington, development standards of the underlying zoning may be modified by an adopted master plan or by the Agreement Between the City of Seattle and the University of Washington. Development of a new major institution master plan shall be guided by the Agreement.

 Outside the boundaries of the MIO, restrictions may apply to the acquisition and leasing of property, as described in the Agreement.

 Section 3. Section 23.69.006 of the SMC, which was adopted by Ordinance 115002, is amended as follows:

 23.69.006 Application of regulations.

A.

B. For the University of Washington, notwithstanding Section A above, the following are governed by the Agreement Between the City of Seattle and the University of Washington: uses on campus; development standards; uses outside the campus boundaries; advisory committee responsibilities; and master plan formulation, approval and amendment.

 Section 4. Subsection I of Section 23.69.032 of the SMC, which Section was last amended by Ordinance 118409, is amended as follows:
