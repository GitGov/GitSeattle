 ORDINANCE __________________

 AN ORDINANCE relating to the Seattle Public Utilities; authorizing an acceptance of funds from the Washington State Major League Baseball Stadium Public Facilities District, increasing appropriation authority, and authorizing a transfer of $356,000 from Finance General to Seattle Public Utilities;

 WHEREAS, the Washington State Major League Baseball Stadium Public Facilities District (the "PFD") is responsible for developing a new retractable roof stadium suitable for major league baseball and associated facilities, including parking (the "Ballpark"); and

 WHEREAS, the PFD plans to construct certain improvements designed to improve pedestrian access to and from the Ballpark; and

 WHEREAS, the City wishes to conduct utility work underneath Occidental Avenue South and First Avenue South prior to the PFD's planned construction of the pedestrian improvements; and

 WHEREAS, Seattle Public Utilities and the PFD (the "Parties") wish to coordinate their efforts to avoid duplication of work, to ensure that the pedestrian improvements are completed before the opening of the Ballpark, and to reduce public impact to the greatest extent possible; and

 WHEREAS, the Parties agree that the most efficient means for the Parties to coordinate their efforts is for the PFD to pay the City to construct the improvements described in the contract executed between the City and the PFD; and

 WHEREAS, in a November 1997 supplemental ordinance the City appropriated $356,000 in the Finance General budget to fund the City's share for these improvements.

In the event that the cost to the PFD exceeds $954,800, the PFD and the City will work together to reduce the scope of the improvements. In addition or in the alternative, the PFD, at its sole option may agree to provide the City with additional funds to pay for the improvements' increased costs.

 These funds are to be deposited in the Water Fund and will be used to implement this project. In order to pay for necessary costs and expenses to be incurred for the construction of these improvements, the expenditure allowance for the 1999 Budget of the Seattle Public Utilities is increased as follows:
