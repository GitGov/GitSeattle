 BE IT ORDAINED BY THE CITY OF SEATTLE AS FOLLOWS:

 Section 1. The City Council makes the following findings:

 Current residential solid waste collection contracts end on March 31, 2000. In order to have new contracts in place by April 1, 2000, the City issued a solid waste collection Request for Proposals (RFP) on October 30, 1998.

 On February 12, 1999 the City received RFP responses from General Disposal Corp., Green Team of San Jose, U.S. Disposal II, and Washington Waste Hauling & Recycling, Inc. After RFP evaluation, which included a "service revision" request phase, and a "final and best" phase, the City selected U.S. Disposal II and Washington Waste Hauling & Recycling, Inc. for contract negotiations.

 The contracts are for a seven-year period beginning April 1, 2000 and ending on March 31, 2007. The City, at its option, may extend the contracts for two successive one-year periods. If the City should extend the contracts, the same terms, conditions and methods of payment will apply during the extended period.

 The contract with U.S. Disposal II is for collection of residential garbage, yard waste and recyclables south of the Ship Canal, and for processing of all recyclables collected throughout the City. The contract with Washington Waste Hauling & Recycling Inc. is for collection of residential garbage, yard waste and recyclables north of the Ship Canal. The City also retains an option with both collection firms for separate collection of food waste beginning April 1, 2001, April 1, 2002 or April 1, 2003.

 Section 2. The Director of Seattle Public Utilities is hereby authorized to execute, on behalf of The City of Seattle, contracts for the collection of residential solid waste, recyclables and yard waste, substantially in the form of the contracts with Washington Waste Hauling & Recycling, Inc. and U.S. Disposal II attached to this ordinance.

 Section 3. Any act consistent with the authority and prior to the effective date of this ordinance is hereby ratified and confirmed.
