 AN ORDINANCE relating to a hygiene center; authorizing the acceptance and disbursement of funds for the construction of a hygiene center to be located at the Julie Apartments, a low- income housing and human services project located at 1922 Ninth Avenue; authorizing related agreements; and ratifying and confirming prior acts.

 WHEREAS, in connection with the adoption of the 1998 Budget the City Council passed a Statement of Legislative Intent with respect to the funding of a hygiene center at the Julie Apartments;

 WHEREAS, consistent with the Statement of Legislative Intent, funding for construction of the hygiene center includes $250,000 in private contributions pledged to the project by the Downtown Seattle Association ("DSA"), and pursuant to that pledge the DSA and certain private parties have provided or are willing to provide funds to the City, acting as a conduit for funds to be disbursed to the Low-Income Housing Institute (LIHI), the present owner of the Julie Apartments, for costs of the hygiene center;

 WHEREAS, the DHHS Director and LIHI executed a Housing Loan Agreement dated February 23, 1998 and a Community Facilities Loan Agreement dated February 23, 1998 (collectively, the "Loan Agreements") providing in part for the construction of a hygiene center as part of the scope of work for the Julie Apartments project, and LIHI has committed to operate the hygiene center for the benefit of low-income persons; and

 WHEREAS, the Loan Agreements provide for contributions from private sources to be obtained by LIHI for the construction of the hygiene center; NOW, THEREFORE,

 BE IT ORDAINED BY THE CITY OF SEATTLE AS FOLLOWS:

 Section 1. The DHHS Director is authorized, for and on behalf of The City of Seattle, to administer and enforce the Loan Agreements, including the provisions for construction of a hygiene center on the property known as the Julie Apartments located at 1922 Ninth Avenue in Seattle.

 Section 2. The DHHS Director and Finance Director are hereby authorized, for and on behalf of the City, to accept, in trust, funds provided to the City by the DSA and private parties in the amount of up to TWO HUNDRED FIFTY THOUSAND DOLLARS ($250,000) for costs of the Julie Apartments hygiene center. Such funds shall be deposited in a special account of the General Gifts and Donations Trust Fund ("Hygiene Center Account"). Interest on such funds from the date first deposited in any City account shall accrue to the Hygiene Center Account. The funds in the Hygiene Center Account shall be held in trust for LIHI for the purposes of the Julie Apartments hygiene center project. Disbursement of such funds to LIHI shall be subject to such conditions as the DHHS Director shall require, which may include full compliance by LIHI with the terms and conditions of the Loan Agreements. The City Finance Director is authorized, at the request of the DHHS Director or her designee, to disburse to LIHI or at LIHI's direction, from the Hygiene Center Account, up to the entire amount therein, or such lesser amount as may be disbursed consistent with any terms on which funds are received from the DSA and private parties, in order to pay a portion of the costs of construction of the Julie Apartments hygiene center, and any related costs consistent with any terms upon which the funds are provided to the City. The Finance Director is further authorized, at the request of the DHHS Director, to disburse any remaining balance of the funds in the Hygiene Center Account, after all authorized disbursements have been made to LIHI, to the DSA or at the direction of the DSA. In case of any uncertainty as to who may be entitled to any funds in the Hygiene Center Account, the Finance Director is authorized to deposit such funds with the registry of the King County Superior Court and to file an appropriate interpleader action.

 Section 3. The DHHS Director is further authorized, for and on behalf of the City, to deliver to LIHI any checks from private parties made payable to LIHI and delivered to the City, on such terms and conditions as the DHHS Director shall deem necessary or appropriate to carry out the intent of this ordinance and the Loan Agreements. If any such check is made payable jointly to the City and LIHI, the DHHS Director is authorized, for and on behalf of the City, to indorse such check, without recourse. In the alternative, the DHHS Director may obtain LIHI's indorsement and deposit any such check(s) in the Hygiene Center Account, or may exchange such checks for checks payable to the City for deposit in the Hygiene Center Account pursuant to Section 2 of this ordinance.

 Section 4. Any actions pursuant to the authority of this ordinance and prior to its effective date are hereby ratified and confirmed.

 Section 5. This ordinance shall take effect and be in force thirty (30 ) days from and after its approval by the Mayor, but if not approved and returned by the Mayor within ten (10) days after presentation, it shall take effect as provided by Municipal Code Section 1.04.020.
