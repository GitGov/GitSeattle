 VIEW TREE PRUNING PERMIT

 Private citizens may apply for a permit if they wish to hire a qualified, bonded tree service firm to perform view tree pruning which is not normally done as part of the Department tree maintenance program along its designated viewpoints and scenic drives. The request for this permit must be submitted in writing to the Manager of our City Wide Horticulture Unit. Three site inspections by a Department Landscape Supervisor will be performed. The first inspection to review the request and make a determination of allowed pruning, the second (if the request is approved) during the proposed work to ensure compliance with the permit, and a final inspection for satisfaction of all permit specifications. A non-refundable application fee of $30.00 must be submitted with the written request for a View Pruning Permit. A $100.00 permit fee is due upon issuance of the View Pruning Permit. The tree service firm must submit a $100.00 bond and proof of insurance in a minimum amount of $1,000,000 bodily injury liability and $5,000 property damage.

 EXAMPLES OF PROMOTIONAL AND MARKETING FEE WAIVERS AND REDUCTIONS

 The Superintendent of Parks and Recreation is authorized to waive or reduce entry or use fees from those contained in an approved fee schedule in conjunction with the promotion and marketing of park programs.

 Authorized activities include, but are not limited to, the following arrangements:

 (1) Sponsored days: A sponsored day or activity under which a sponsor pays the department a fixed fee, a matching amount, or supplies advertising, service or other benefit and the department provides free public entry use of the facility or the department provides free or reduced entry for a segment of the public (e.g. children under 12, senior citizens, anyone donating clothing or a can of food for a drive for those in need) or for a special group of the public (e.g., military personnel, Boy or Girl Scouts, participants in a community parade) or to the first entrants up to a specified number.

 (2) Bonus and prizes: The department may distribute to users or entrants a item supplied by the sponsor, e.g., a button, a balloon, literature, or an item of apparel, or a donated prize for an achievement.

 (3) Combination Tickets: A combination ticket for use of the City's facility or participation in a City event in conjunction with entry to another facility or event in which the combined prices are less than the amount that would be paid for each entry or event singly; the combined ticket shall expire within a proximate time after its sale or first usage; and the City and the other participant shall apportion the revenue from the combined sale by a ratio or formula. A combination may also take the form of a reciprocal discount or credit. For example, presentation of ticket stub or coupon from a Zoo in another City may entitle the holder to a credit on admission to the Woodland Park Zoo or the Seattle Aquarium when a receipt for paid entry to Seattle's Zoo or Aquarium entitles the holder to like privileges in the facility of the other City.

 (4) Discount Coupons: A coupon allowing two people to enter for the price one person, or the coupon holder to enter at a reduced rate. Coupons may be offered through a sponsor who makes a payment to the City or who provides special advertising in return. For example, the coupon may accompany an advertisement in a widely distributed publication for tourists, which contains similar coupons for other attractions. The department may also use coupons as a way of reaching out to a group or segment of the citizenry who would not attend or use the facility at the established fee.

 (5) Prepaid Passes: During special hours or otherwise, admission may be sold to a tour company, the organizer of a convention, or an association at an aggregate fee for all members and the participants may be granted entry, either as a group or individually, at the hours or on the days authorized by presenting a ticket or other indication of pre-payment.

 (6) Departmental Free or Half-Price Days: "Senior citizen's days" may be offered during which people over a minimum age are admitted free; a free day may be provided for the public to see and enjoy an exhibit financed through a bond issue or by a public fund-raising drive; or, on a "kid's day"/Neighborhood Day," admission may be free for children and low income adults; a free golf lesson day for kids; or free swimming day at our pools.

 (7) Promotional Purposes: The Department may offer extended evening hours or special discounts during specific periods in the year to encourage high attendance to our park facilities. Some examples include but are not limited to, the following:

 a) Extended Aquarium hours and special discounts during the summer. b) Extended special discount for swimming fees during the summer.
