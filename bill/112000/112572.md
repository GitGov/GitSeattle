 WHEREAS, TCI of Washington, Inc. (TCI) holds a cable television franchise which includes the obligation to rebuild parts of its system in the City of Seattle pursuant to Ordinance No. 117956 as amended by Ordinance No. 119183, and

 WHEREAS, the franchise provides that TCI will rebuild its cable system to 750 MHz capability within three years from the date the franchise took effect, and to provide at least 70 analog channels over the new system within six months after that date, and

 WHEREAS, the effective date for rebuild completion was January 20, 1999, and

 WHEREAS, TCI has advised the City that it could not complete the rebuild by the effective date, and has requested a nine month extension to complete construction of the rebuilt system, and

 WHEREAS, the City has sought subscriber input to consider TCI's request, and has received subscriber input via public hearings held on January 24, 1999 and February 4, 1999, telephone calls, and written and electronic correspondence, and

 WHEREAS, the Council has determined that an extension is only appropriate upon assurance that TCI will meet standards and agree to conditions that assure provision of high quality, responsive cable television services, as set forth below, and

 WHEREAS, these standards and conditions are commercially practicable, and consistent with the community's needs and interests.

 BE IT ORDAINED BY THE CITY OF SEATTLE AS FOLLOWS:

 Section 1. The Mayor is authorized to execute an amendment to TCI's franchise agreement authorized by and set forth in Exhibit A to Ordinance 117956, as amended by Ordinance No. 119183, consistent with the terms and conditions set forth in this Ordinance.

 Section 2

 Extensions

 a. TCI is granted a nine month extension to the rebuild deadline set forth in Section 8.2 of the franchise. TCI's new deadline for completing the rebuild of its cable system to 70 channel, 750 MHz capability is October 21, 1999.

 b. TCI is granted an extension to the deadline for providing expanded programming and channel capacity set forth in Section 5.3 of the franchise. For purposes of this ordinance, and in addition to the existing franchise requirements and provisions, "expanded programming" is defined to mean the mix, level and quality of cable services available to West Seattle subscribers over the rebuilt system on January 20, 1999, and includes cable modem services. TCI's new deadline for providing expanded programming and channel capacity throughout its Seattle franchise areas is December 21, 1999.

 Section 3. Customer Rebates

 a. TCI will provide a five dollar credit to all subscribers not receiving expanded programming and channel capacity on January 21, 1999. The credit will offset basic tier service rates, and will appear on subscriber statements within thirty days of the effective date of this ordinance. TCI will not require subscribers to redeem coupons or submit evidence of eligibility for the credit. At the City's request, TCI will make available customer records sufficient to permit the City to audit compliance with this section.

 b. On the twenty first day of each month following January, 1999, TCI will identify all remaining subscribers who cannot receive expanded programming and channel capacity due to TCI's failure to complete the rebuild. Those subscribers will receive a credit against their basic tier service rates, within the following thirty days, in the same manner as in subsection a above. TCI will increase the credit amount by $.50 on the twenty first day of each month following January, 1999, so that the credit effective February 21, 1999 will be $5.50, the credit effective March 21, 1999 will be $6.00, and so on, to a maximum $10.00 credit effective November 21, 1999 to any subscribers not receiving expanded programming and channel capacity due to TCI's failure to complete the rebuild.

 c. Effective December 21, 1999, TCI will provide any subscriber who cannot receive expanded programming and channel capacity due to TCI's failure to complete the rebuild with free basic and non premium services until expanded programming and channel capacity becomes available.

 d. TCI will provide all current subscribers not receiving expanded programming and channel capacity on January 21, 1999 with a coupon or coupons worth at least $8.00 toward pay-per- view, pay per channel, digital or other enhanced services. Beginning February 21, 1999, and continuing monthly thereafter, TCI will provide a coupon redeemable for a pay-per-view movie to all subscribers not receiving expanded programming and channel capacity due to TCI's failure to complete the rebuild.

 e. Nothing in this ordinance shall compel TCI to provide services and or service credits to residents of multi-unit buildings where TCI is unable to secure a right of entry agreement consistent with the provisions governing those agreements established in the Franchise. TCI shall maintain evidence that it has attempted to secure a right of entry agreement, and provide such evidence to the City at the City's request. In the case of multiple dwelling unit (MDU) accounts served under non-commercial bulk rate agreements where the residents do not receive a separate billing from TCI, the required rebates will be made to the person or entity responsible for payment.

 Section 4. Construction and Activation Schedule

 a. No later than February 17, 1999, TCI will provide the City with (1) a detailed system design map that includes at a minimum the location of all remaining proposed optical transfer nodes and the area to be served by each node, (2) a construction schedule that establishes the activation of at least six new nodes per month, and (3) the specific number of remaining subscribers to be served with expanded programming and channel capacity as of January 21, 1999 (the January Remaining Subscribers). Effective February 21, 1999, and on the twenty first of each following month, TCI shall certify and provide evidence, including a written status report and as-built drawings, that the company has completed sufficient rebuild construction to ensure expanded programming and channel capacity to an additional eleven percent of the January Remaining Subscribers within sixty days. TCI's obligation is cumulative, and is intended to ensure that construction proceeds regularly every month until it is complete by October 21, 1999.

 b. In the event that TCI fails to meet its monthly cumulative construction requirement, TCI will pay to the City liquidated damages in the amount of (a) $100,000 per month; or (b) $100 multiplied by the number of remaining subscribers necessary to meet TCI's cumulative monthly construction requirement, calculated for each day following TCI's failure to meet its cumulative monthly construction requirement, whichever is less. Payment will begin to accrue on the first day immediately following TCI's failure to meet its cumulative monthly construction requirement. There will be no cap on liquidated damages paid to the City under this section for construction delays extending beyond October 21, 1999.

 c. Effective April 21, 1999, and on the twenty first day of each following month, TCI shall certify, and provide evidence that it has activated at least six new nodes and made available expanded programming and channel capacity to an additional eleven percent of its January Remaining Subscribers over the previous thirty days. TCI's obligation is cumulative, and is intended to ensure that subscribers are activated regularly every month until all remaining subscribers are activated by December 21, 1999.

 d. In the event that TCI fails to meet its cumulative monthly activation requirement, TCI will pay to the City liquidated damages in the amount of (a) $100,000 per month; or (b) $100 multiplied by the number of remaining subscribers necessary to meet TCI's cumulative monthly activation requirement, calculated for each day following TCI's failure to meet its cumulative monthly activation requirement. Payment shall begin to accrue on the first day immediately following TCI's failure to meet its cumulative monthly activation requirement. There will be no cap on liquidated damages paid to the City under this section for activation delays extending beyond December 21, 1999.

 e. In addition to the foregoing, TCI will continue to pay to the City $10,000 per month liquidated damages for the rebuild delay established under Section 8.2 of the franchise. In the event that TCI does not complete rebuild construction by October 21, 1999, liquidated damages will increase to $50,000 per month until rebuild construction is complete. In the event that TCI does not make expanded programming and channel capacity available to all of its customers in the franchise area by December 21, 1999, liquidated damages will increase to $50,000 per month until expanded programming and channel capacity becomes available.

 f. The complete construction and activation schedule established in the preceding sections is set forth, for illustrative purposes, only as Exhibit A to this ordinance, and will be modified by specific information on remaining customers that TCI provides pursuant to subsection a above.

 Section 5. Audit

 The City will conduct at least three audits of TCI's compliance with the construction, activation and certification requirements set forth above, during 1999. TCI will make available records and personnel that the City requests in order to complete the audit, within fifteen (15) days of the City's request TCI will compensate the City for the reasonable actual costs associated with these audits in an amount not to exceed fifteen thousand dollars, and such compensation shall not reduce or offset other amounts owed the City under this agreement or under the franchise, and shall not be considered franchise fees.

 Section 6. Rate Freeze. Beginning January 21, 1999, TCI will freeze, and not increase basic and non-premium cable programming service tier rates for those subscribers who cannot receive expanded programming and channel capacity due to TCI's failure to complete the rebuild, notwithstanding any other rights TCI may have to increase rates regulated under FCC rules and procedures or to increase unregulated rates. The rate freeze will not impair subscriber discounts that are otherwise available, or credits available under this ordinance, or refunds or rebates that may be ordered by the City Hearing Examiner in a rate proceeding. Rebates and other credits established in this ordinance will not be offset or reduced by actual or deferred rate increases. TCI may not include any costs incurred pursuant to this ordinance as external costs in any rate proceeding before the City Hearing Examiner.

 TCI further agrees that, consistent with its franchise agreement, it will not incorporate costs of the system rebuild and upgrade in any current or future filing for any increases in City of Seattle basic service tier rates, unless such filing is a full cost of service filing (i.e., an FCC Form 1220 filing or any equivalent full cost of service filing established by the FCC). Rebuild costs will not be included as external costs in any benchmark system rate filing (Form 1240 or 1210 filings), nor will TCI file any special upgrade rate filing (Form 1235 filing) to support higher maximum permitted basic service tier rates than provided for in a normal benchmark system rate filing.

 Section 7. Security

 TCI will provide a standard commercial letter of credit, in the amount of two million dollars to ensure payment of liquidated damages established in the franchise and in this ordinance.

 Section 8. Public, Educational and Government Access

 a. TCI will work with the City toward shifting management of the current public access channel to a new, non-profit entity by January 1, 2000. Additionally, TCI will establish, in an amount not less than $525,000, to be negotiated with the City, an annual grant to support continuing operation of the channel, in lieu of TCI's ongoing management. By December 31, 1999, TCI will make code and other repairs necessary to make the public access facility at 98th and Aurora functional, fulfilling the recommendations of a mutually agreed upon independent consultant.

 b. TCI will agree to provide at least four month's notice before changing the placement of any public, educational or government access channel in the channel lineup, and will provide at least $5,000 in cash and in-kind promotional services, to be determined in consultation with designated government, educational and public access managers, to assist in the transition.

 Section 9. Community Involvement

 a. For the purpose of non-commercial community access, TCI will provide within 45 days of the City's request, up to five hundred free cable modem installations, cable modems, and services over the modems to local government and community center sites to be identified by the City in consultation with TCI. For purposes of this section, each interior customer interface installed by TCI will be considered a separate site.

 b. TCI agrees that any disclosure of customer information to third parties for non-cable related purposes that is otherwise consistent with federal law and the franchise agreement will not directly or indirectly reference any subscriber viewing preference for, or the extent of the subscriber's viewing of, particular services. This section shall not be construed to prohibit references to programming tiers, such as basic, expanded basic, pay programming, including the number of pay channels selected, digital services, aggregate monthly revenues collected, and other general descriptions of cable services that do not directly or indirectly disclose subscriber viewing preferences for, or the extent of the subscriber's viewing of, particular services. Further, this section may not be construed to prohibit other disclosures made pursuant to a valid court order authorizing such disclosure consistent with federal law.

 c. TCI will design, plan and implement the remainder of its construction activities to minimize damage to the City's urban forest.

 Section 10. Nothing in this ordinance shall be construed to preclude the City's initiation of termination proceedings or any other remedy under the franchise agreement should TCI fail to complete, in a timely fashion, any term, condition, or requirement of this ordinance.

 Section 11. This franchise extension and associated terms and conditions shall not become effective for any purpose unless and until TCI accepts the conditions of this ordinance and such acceptance is filed with the City Clerk and the Office of Cable Communications. Such acceptance shall be in writing, shall be in a form and substance approved by the City Attorney, and shall be and operate as an acceptance of each and every term and condition and limitation contained in this ordinance, SMC Ch. 21.60, and the Franchise Agreements. All other terms, conditions, and limitations of the Franchise Agreement not specifically amended by this Ordinance shall remain in full force and effect and shall apply to the obligations created by this Ordinance. Any acts consistent with and prior to the effective date of this Ordinance are hereby ratified and confirmed.

 Section 12. This ordinance shall take effect and be in force thirty (30) days from and after its approval by the Mayor, but if not approved and returned by the Mayor within ten (10) days after presentation, it shall take effect as provided by Municipal Code Section 1.04.020.
