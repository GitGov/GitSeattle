 WHEREAS, the Seattle Design Commission conducted a review of the City's design review program in 1997; and

 WHEREAS, in response to the recommendations of the Commission the Department of Construction and Land Use has recommended amendments to the design review program; and

 WHEREAS, the City Council's Business, Economic, and Community Development Committee held a public hearing on the proposal on March 18, 1998 and recommends adoption of the program changes as amended; and

 WHEREAS, significant permit and development activity has occurred in the North District (Lake City) planning area between 1994 and 1998, including approximately 120 development permits, including 23 in multifamily and 7 in commercial zones; and

 WHEREAS, there are currently at least three significant projects under permit review in C1 or C2 zones in the Lake City Area, including over 350 housing units and one six story project; and

 WHEREAS, participants in the North District neighborhood planning process have indicated that they are currently considering the southern boundary of the Lake City urban village and in what area it would be appropriate to require design review and the aspects it promotes, such as greater site planning, compatibility of new development with surroundings, pedestrian orientation and appropriate landscaping; and

 WHEREAS, the North District neighborhood plan is not expected to be acted upon by the City Council until the first quarter of 1999; and

 WHEREAS, if significant development projects are proposed in C1 or C2 zones in the planning area prior to completion of the plan, the effectiveness of the planning process may be reduced; and

 WHEREAS, major projects that would be subject to design review under this ordinance, may vest in C1 or C2 zones within urban villages prior to 30 days from the passage of this ordinance without being subject to design review, potentially detracting from City Comprehensive Plan goals and policies for the character of development within urban villages;
