 AN ORDINANCE relating to the City Light Department; authorizing execution of an assignment agreement between Seattle and BC Hydro for the transmission of Skagit Treaty power.

 WHEREAS, Seattle and the Province of British Columbia entered into an agreement dated March 30, 1984 providing for British Columbia to supply Seattle with power equivalent to that which would have been produced by the construction of the High Ross Dam for the period January 1, 1986 through January 1, 2066; and

 WHEREAS, the Skagit Agreement provides that British Columbia will pay for the costs of transmission from the Province to Seattle; and

 WHEREAS, the Province has delegated its responsibilities for power supply under the Skagit Agreement to its Crown corporation, British Columbia Hydro and Power Authority ("BC Hydro"); and

 WHEREAS, the Skagit Agreement provides that the Province and Seattle will work in concert to achieve mutually beneficial wheeling arrangements which allow for the Province to use transmission capacity when it is not needed for transmission of Skagit Treaty power to Seattle; and

 WHEREAS, the Bonneville Power Administration ("BPA") first provided transmission for the Skagit Treaty power under an IR (Integrated Resources) contract dated November 10, 1987, which did not allow for any other use of the reserved capacity; and

 WHEREAS, since October 1, 1996, BPA has provided transmission for the Skagit Treaty power under a series of temporary point-to-point transmission contracts which do provide for use of the excess capacity; and

 WHEREAS, BPA is now prepared to enter into a longer term point-to- point transmission agreement for the transmission of Skagit Treaty power; and

 WHEREAS, the point-to-point transmission agreement with BPA will allow BC Hydro to use transmission capacity when it is not needed for transmission of Skagit Treaty power to Seattle; and

 WHEREAS, BC Hydro and Seattle have negotiated over the last two years to agree upon an assignment agreement which will allow BC Hydro to utilize excess capacity from BPA while at the same time protecting the firm delivery of Skagit Treaty power to Seattle; NOW THEREFORE,

 BE IT ORDAINED BY THE CITY OF SEATTLE AS FOLLOWS:

 Section 1. The Superintendent of the City Light Department, or his designee, is hereby authorized to enter into an agreement with British Columbia Hydro and Power Authority substantially in the form of the agreement attached to this ordinance entitled, "Agreement for the Transmission of Skagit Treaty Power Between British Columbia Hydro and Power Authority and The City of Seattle."

 The agreement assigns responsibility for transmission and scheduling under Seattle's point-to-point agreement with BPA to BC Hydro in order to facilitate both the delivery of Skagit Treaty power to Seattle and to allow BC Hydro to use the remaining capacity under the point-to- point agreement when it is not needed for deliveries of Skagit Treaty power to Seattle. The term of the agreement between BC Hydro and Seattle is the same as the underlying agreement between Seattle and BPA, becoming effective February 1, 1999 and extending through December 31, 2005.

 Section 2. Any acts taken to accomplish the purpose of this ordinance prior to its effective date are hereby ratified and confirmed.

 Section 3. This ordinance shall take effect and be in force thirty (30) days from and after its approval by the Mayor, but if not approved and returned by the Mayor within ten (10) days after presentation, it shall take effect as provided by Municipal Code Section 1.04.020.
