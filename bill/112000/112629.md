 WHEREAS, there will be sufficient cash in the Cumulative Reserve Subfund to support a loan, as contemplated in subsection 5.06.030C of the Seattle Municipal Code, to the project fund to support further design activities; Now, Therefore,

 BE IT ORDAINED BY THE CITY OF SEATTLE AS FOLLOWS

 Section 1. A new fund, the "South Police Stations Fund," is hereby established into which shall be deposited the monies to be used for the new Southwest Precinct Police Station and modifications to the existing South Precinct Police Station (hereinafter together referred to as "the Project"), and from which all Project expenditures shall be made. Interest earnings on balances in this fund shall be credited to the Fund. The Finance Director may create subfunds and accounts as needed to facilitate accounting for activities in connection with the Project.

 Section 2. The Executive Services Director is authorized to proceed with design activities for the Project.

 Section 3. In order to pay for the cost of the design of the Project, ONE MILLION, ONE HUNDRED NINETY TWO THOUSAND DOLLARS ($1,192,000) is hereby appropriated from the South Police Stations Fund. To reimburse the Supplemental Appropriations Account of the Emergency Subfund for site selection expenses as called for in Ordinance 119055, the sum of FIFTY THOUSAND DOLLARS ($50,000) is hereby appropriated from the South Police Stations Fund.

 Section 4. To support the appropriations made in Section 3, an interfund loan from the Cumulative Reserve Subfund to the South Police Stations Fund is authorized in the maximum amount of ONE MILLION TWO HUNDRED FORTY TWO THOUSAND DOLLARS ($1,242,000). This loan shall be used only for purposes authorized by this ordinance. This loan will begin with the effective date of this ordinance and shall last not longer than two (2) years hereafter, or until long-term project financing is obtained, whichever occurs first. The South Police Stations Fund shall pay interest to the Cumulative Reserve Subfund on the borrowed funds at a rate that reflects the rate of return on the City's cash pool common investment portfolio. The principal amount of the loan from the Cumulative Reserve Subfund together with interest shall be repaid from the South Police Stations Fund with proceeds from longer term project funding expected to be obtained by the sale of general obligation bonds prior to construction of the Project or from other sources. The Finance Director is hereby authorized to make the fund transfers and to take all other appropriate actions to administer the loan.

 Section 5. If the design of the Project authorized in this ordinance has not been completed by the end of 1999, the appropriations in this ordinance shall carry forward from year to year until expended or abandoned by ordinance.

 Section 6. All acts consistent with the authority and prior to the effective date of this ordinance are hereby ratified and confirmed.

 Section 7. This ordinance shall take effect and be in force thirty (30) days from and after its approval by the Mayor, but if not approved and returned by the Mayor within ten (10) days after presentation, it shall take effect as provided by Municipal Code Section 1.04.020.
