 AN ORDINANCE relating to low-income elderly and handicapped housing, authorizing an amendment to the Housing Cooperation Agreement between the City and the Seattle Housing Authority approved by Ordinance 110433; establishing conditions for a lease and related agreements by the Seattle Housing Authority for the use of low-income housing tax credits to fund rehabilitation of housing at the former Ravenna School; and appropriating for capital purposes remaining proceeds of the City's Low-income Elderly and Handicapped Housing Bonds and earnings thereon, all by a three-fourths vote of the City Council.

 WHEREAS, pursuant to Ordinance 110124 there was presented to the voters of The City of Seattle in November 1981, and the voters approved, issuance of general obligation bonds of the City in the amount of $48,170,000 ("Bonds") to finance low-income elderly and handicapped housing to be acquired and developed by the Housing Authority of the City of Seattle ("SHA"); and

 WHEREAS, one of the projects financed with the Bonds was the former Ravenna School, which was acquired and renovated by SHA, and is operated as housing for low-income senior citizens; and

 WHEREAS, at the time of the initial renovation of the Ravenna School building SHA did not replace the roof, which then still had some remaining useful life, but the roof now requires replacement; and

 WHEREAS, SHA, in order to obtain private capital for the needed renovations of the Ravenna School while preserving its use as housing for low-income senior citizens, has applied for low- income housing tax credits, which have been awarded for the project by the Washington State Housing Finance Commission; and

 WHEREAS, in order to comply with Internal Revenue Code provisions regarding low-income housing tax credits, SHA has organized a limited partnership, with SHA as its general partner, to lease the Ravenna School from SHA; and

 WHEREAS, the Cooperation Agreement between the City and SHA authorized by Ordinance 110433 and dated March 26, 1982 ("Cooperation Agreement"), provided for the use of the proceeds of the Bonds and the ownership and operation of the housing acquired and developed with those proceeds, but did not address the type of leasing arrangements now required for low-income housing tax credits; and

 WHEREAS, there remains in the fund established for proceeds of the Bonds, and earnings thereon, a small amount that SHA proposes to use for capital improvements to other low-income elderly and handicapped housing projects; and

 WHEREAS, the City and SHA desire to amend the Cooperation Agreement to expressly authorize the lease of the Ravenna School on terms and conditions designed to ensure the long-term use of the property as low-income elderly and handicapped housing, and to authorize the use of remaining proceeds of the Bonds and earnings thereon for capital purposes consistent with the intent of the original bond ordinance; NOW, THEREFORE,

 BE IT ORDAINED BY THE CITY OF SEATTLE AS FOLLOWS:

 Section 1. The Mayor or Director of Housing is authorized to execute, deliver, and perform, for and on behalf of The City of Seattle, an amendment to the Cooperation Agreement in the form attached to this ordinance as Exhibit A, with any modifications and additions that the Mayor or such Director shall determine are necessary or appropriate to implement the intent of this Ordinance. The Mayor or Director of Housing is further authorized, for and on behalf of The City of Seattle, to negotiate, accept, record, administer, modify and enforce a regulatory agreement on the Ravenna School property on terms substantially consistent with the description thereof in Exhibit A to this ordinance; to approve a form of lease for such property and any modifications to such lease; to approve the terms of an amended limited partnership agreement, or portions thereof, for the partnership leasing such property; and to execute, deliver and accept such other documents and take such other actions as he or she shall deem necessary or appropriate to implement the intent of this Ordinance.

 Section 2. There is hereby appropriated from the Low-Income Elderly and Handicapped Housing Development Fund established by Section 5 of Ordinance 110124, from any remaining proceeds of the Bonds and earnings on Bond proceeds through December 31, 2001 (or such earlier date when all amounts in such Fund shall have been fully disbursed), the amount of TWO HUNDRED FORTY THOUSAND DOLLARS ($240,000), or such lesser amount as shall be available in such Fund, for the purposes described in Section 6 of Exhibit A to this ordinance. After execution and delivery by the City and SHA of the Amendment to Cooperation Agreement authorized by Section 1 above, the Director of Housing is authorized to approve disbursements of such funds upon application of SHA. Resolution 27336 is hereby abrogated.

 Section 3. Any action pursuant to the authority of this ordinance and prior to its effective date is hereby ratified and confirmed.

 Section 4. The foregoing appropriation is made to meet actual necessary expenditures of the City for which insufficient appropriation has been made due to causes which could not reasonably have been foreseen at the time of the adoption of the 1999 budget; therefore, in accordance with RCW 35.32A, by reason of the facts above stated, this Ordinance shall take effect and be in force thirty (30) days from and after its approval by the Mayor, but if not approved and returned by the Mayor within ten (10) days after presentation, it shall take effect as provided by Municipal Code Section 1.04.020.
