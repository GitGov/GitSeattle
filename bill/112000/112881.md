 MEMORANDUM OF AGREEMENT by and between

 THE CITY OF SEATTLE/SEATTLE TRANSPORTATION DEPARTMENT

 and

 INTERNATIONAL BROTHERHOOD OF ELECTRICAL WORKERS, LOCAL 77

 On March 31, 1999, the Wage Review Committee convened and heard the Union's case for a wage adjustment for both the Signal Electrician and Crew Chief. The Committee has reviewed all of the information presented and has come up with the following recommendations:

Signal Electrician: The body of work performed by the Signal Electrician has changed over time and has become more difficult, complex, and responsible. We have revised the Classification Specification to reflect these changes; and, in consideration, we recommend that effective January 23, 1999, the classification of Signal Electrician receive a 6% increase.

 As a result of the increase to the classification of Signal Electrician, the wage rates for the title Signal Electrician - assigned in charge of a three-member crew will also be adjusted to reflect a 6.7% increase effective January 23, 1999.

Signal Electrician Crew Chief: The Traffic Control Supervisor position was abrogated; and, as a result, the Signal Electrician Crew Chiefs have taken on additional, higher-level duties. To compensate for this increase in duties, we recommend that effective January 23, 1999, the wage rates for the classification of Signal Electrician Crew Chief receive a 5.9% increase.

 Signed this __________ day of ________________, 1999.
