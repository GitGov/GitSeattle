PRELIMINARY REPORT

EVALUATION OF REUSE AND DISPOSAL OPTIONS FOR 14.87 ACRES OF CITY LIGHT PROPERTY

Resolution 29799 directs the Executive to make its recommendations on the reuse or disposal of excess property on a case by case basis, using the Procedures for Evaluation of the Reuse and Disposal of the City's Real Property adopted by that resolution. Additionally, the Resolution identifies guidelines which are to be considered in making a recommendation. This report addresses each of the guidelines outlined in Resolution 29799 in support of the recommendation.

Property Management Area: (PMA#9052) City Light Property, known as 'Duck Pond I'

 BACKGROUND INFORMATION

Legal Description: Government Lot 1, Section 18, Township 38 North,

 Range 43 East, W.M., Pend Oreille County, Wa.

 EXCEPT THEREFROM that portion thereof described in

 a deed to the State of Washington, recorded

 October 31, 1927, under Auditor's Recording

 No. 30374 in Book 14 of Deed Records, page 618,

 and correction recorded March 13, 1928, under

 Auditor's Recording No. 30922 in Book 15 of Deed Records, page 104.

Physical Description and Related Factors: The property consists of an irregular, triangle-shaped parcel of 14.87 acres, bisected by State Highway 31 and bordering the west shore of the Pend Oreille River. At the time City Light purchased the property, the property was determined to consist of one building site and flood land river frontage on the east side of the highway; on the west side of the highway, the balance of approximately 11 acres is timber.

 The property was purchased for the installation of Generating Units 55 and 56 at the Boundary Powerhouse. The site was intended to be used, together with the adjacent State-owned shorelands of the Pend Oreille River, to create an artificial slough for a waterfowl nesting site under the Boundary Project Wildlife Program, as mitigation for environmental impacts attributable to the installation of Units 55 and 56.

 A 155 acre site on the opposite side of the river (Duck Pond II) was purchased in 1986 and submitted to the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) as the mitigation site for Units 55 and 56, and the subject site was not developed.

GUIDELINE A: CONSISTENCY

The analysis should consider the purpose for which the property was originally acquired, funding sources used to acquire the property, terms and conditions of original acquisition, the title or deed conveying the property, or any other contract or instrument by which the City is bound or to which the property is subject, and City, state or federal ordinances, statues and regulations.

 The property was purchased on October 14, 1985 under CIP Work Order No. 93095 for $36,000 using the City Light Fund. The purchase price was determined by an appraisal report submitted by a local area Broker/Appraiser. There is no reservation of timber or mineral rights.

Guideline B: Compatibility and Suitability

The recommendation should reflect an assessment of the potential for use of the property in support of adopted Neighborhood Plans, as or in support of low-income housing, in support of economic development, in support of affordable housing, for park or open space; in support of Sound Transit Link Light Rail station area development; as or in support of child care facilities, and in support of other priorities reflected in adopted City policies.

 The property has been circulated to other City departments and to outside government agencies. None of the agencies have indicated an interest in acquiring the property. The fair market value of the property, as determined be an independent appraiser on October 26, 1998, was found and declared to be $95,000.00. The Property Review Process Determination Form (Attachment "A") has been completed in accordance with Disposition Policies and Procedures. This proposed Disposition meets the criteria for a "Simple" transaction.

Guideline C: Other Factors

The recommendation should consider the highest and best use of the property, compatibility of the proposed use with the physical characteristics of the property and with surrounding uses,

 timing and term of the proposed use, appropriateness of the consideration to be received, unique attributes that make the property hard to replace, potential for consolidation with adjacent public property to accomplish future goals and objectives, conditions in the real estate market, and known environmental factors that make affect the value of the property.

Known environmental factors:

 There are no known environmental factors.

Guideline D Sale

The recommendation should evaluate the potential for selling the property to non-City public entities and to members of the general public.

 The following actions were considered in the evaluation:

 List the property for sale, based on appraised value, with a local real estate professional for a specified period, or sign an agreement with a real estate professional to offer the property for sale at public bid.

 Advertise a sale by public bid directly in local newspapers.

 Negotiate a sales agreement with an abutting property owner (interest has been expressed).

 Retain the property.

 A sale to an abutter is the most cost effective and expeditious method of sale, a public bid process will provide more certainty on the market value of the property; however, a public bid process will provide a better opportunity to achieve market value for the property.

RECOMMENDATION

The Real Estate Oversight Committee recommends that the property be offered for sale by public bid in a manner to be selected by the City Light Superintendent.
