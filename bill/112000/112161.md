 AN ORDINANCE relating to land use and zoning amending Section 23.44.041 of the Seattle Municipal Code (Title 23, Land Use Code) to correct a clerical error in the adoption of Ordinance 118794 related to the parking waiver process for accessory dwelling units.

 NOW THEREFORE, BE IT ORDAINED BY THE CITY OF SEATTLE AS FOLLOWS:

 Section 1. Subsection A of Section 23.44.041 of the Seattle Municipal Code, which Section was last amended by Ordinance 118794, is amended as follows:

 23.44.041 Accessory dwelling units.

 Accessory dwelling units may be permitted subject to the standards in subsection A of this section until two thousand five hundred (2,500) applications for new (not for legalization of existing) accessory dwelling units are filed. If, prior to the occurrence of the foregoing condition, applications are filed for accessory dwelling units which would cause the concentration of single-family structures with new accessory dwelling units to exceed twenty (20) percent of all single- family structures in single-family zones in any one (1) census tract or in an area formed by a circle with a radius of one thousand (1,000) feet from the point at which three (3) or more census tracts meet, no further applications may be accepted for accessory dwelling units in such census tract or area. The Master Use Permit process set forth in Chapter 23.76 shall be followed to authorize these uses.

 A. The Director may authorize an accessory dwelling unit if the Director finds that the unit meets the following development and use standards:

 1. A single-family dwelling may have no more than one (1) accessory dwelling unit, and only one (1) accessory dwelling unit shall be allowed per lot.

 2. One (1) of the dwelling units in the structure shall be occupied by one (1) or more owners of the property as the owner's(s') permanent and principal residence; provided that the Director may waive this requirement for temporary absences of less than one (1) year, where the accessory unit has been a permitted use for at least two (2) years and the owner submits proof of absence from the Puget Sound region.

 3. Any number of related persons may occupy each unit in a single- family residence with an accessory dwelling unit provided that if unrelated persons occupy either unit, the total number of persons occupying both units together may not exceed eight (8).

 4. Accessory dwelling units may not be located in any structure detached from the single-family dwelling.

 5. The floor area of the accessory dwelling unit may exceed one thousand (1,000) square feet only if a permit was filed to construct the portion of the structure in which the accessory dwelling unit is located before May 31, 1996, and if the entire accessory dwelling unit is located on one level.

 6. Only one (1) entrance may be located on each front or street side of the residence except where two (2) entrances on the front or street side existed on January 1, 1993.

 7. A minimum of two (2) off-street parking spaces shall be provided, which spaces may be in tandem. The Director may waive the requirement for one (1) or both of the spaces if the accessory dwelling unit is not located in a residential parking zone (RPZ) or in the University District Parking Overlay Area or Alki Area, pursuant to Maps A and B, Section 23.54.015, and if topography or location of existing principal or accessory structures makes provision of one (1) or both of the parking spaces unduly burdensome ~~and if adequate parking capacity exists~~. The applicant need not apply for a variance in order for the Director to waive this requirement. If the accessory dwelling unit is located in an RPZ and if topography or location of existing structures makes provision of one or both of the parking spaces unduly burdensome, the Director may waive the parking requirement if a parking study is completed and if adequate parking capacity exists. On-street parking shall be considered at capacity when the utilization rate is seventy-five (75) percent or greater within a four hundred (400) foot walking distance of the subject property. ~~The Council shall reconsider the definition of on-street parking capacity within one (1) year of the effective date of the ordinance codified in this section.1~~ The parking waiver process cannot be used to eliminate existing parking spaces in order to create an accessory dwelling unit.

 8. If the portion of the single-family dwelling in which the accessory dwelling unit is located was in existence prior to October 17, 1979, the minimum ceiling height shall be six (6) feet eight (8) inches measured per Sections 310.6.1 and 3403 of the Seattle Building Code. The minimum ceiling height shall be six (6) feet four (4) inches if a hard-wired smoke detector is located in the dwelling unit. If the portion of the single-family dwelling in which the accessory dwelling unit is located was constructed on or subsequent to October 17, 1979, the minimum ceiling height shall be seven (7) feet six (6) inches measured per Sections 310.6.1 and 3403 of the Seattle Building Code.

 Section 2. This ordinance shall take effect and be in force thirty (30) days from and after its approval by the Mayor, but if not approved and returned by the Mayor within ten (10) days after presentation, it shall take effect as provided by Municipal Code Section 1.04.020.
