 BE IT ORDAINED BY THE CITY OF SEATTLE AS FOLLOWS:

 Section 1. Section 5.44.120 of the Seattle Municipal Code is amended as follows:

 5.44.120 Appeals and judicial review.

 A person aggrieved by the amount of the tax, fee, interest, or penalty assessed by the Finance Director under the provisions of this chapter may appeal the Director's decision only as provided in this section. A person aggrieved by the denial of a refund by the Finance Director under provisions of this chapter may appeal the Director's decision only if and as provided in this section. The denial of a refund may be appealed only if the taxes for which a refund is sought were not the subject of any assessment by the Finance Director. An appeal to the Hearing Examiner of either an assessment or a denial of a request for a refund is an administrative remedy that must be exhausted before judicial review of an assessment or denial of a refund may be sought.

 A. In order to appeal, a person aggrieved shall file a written appeal ("petition") with the Office of the Hearing Examiner within twenty (20) days from the date that the assessment or denial notice was mailed to the taxpayer, or within the period covered by any extension of said due date granted in writing by the Finance Director.

 The Finance Director may grant an extension of the appeal period only if the taxpayer, within the twenty (20) day period to appeal, makes written application showing good cause why an extension is necessary. A copy of the petition must be provided by the person filing it to the Finance Director and the City Attorney on or before the date the petition is filed with the Hearing Examiner. If no such petition is filed with the Hearing Examiner and provided to the Finance Director and City Attorney within the twenty (20) day period, the assessment covered by the notice shall become final and no refund request may be made for the audit period covered in that assessment.

 B. The petition shall set forth the reasons why the assessment should be reversed or modified. The petition shall also include the amount of the tax, fee, interest, or penalties which the taxpayer believes to be due. If the appeal is from the denial of a refund, the petition shall set forth the amount of refund or credit the taxpayer believes to be due. The Hearing Examiner shall fix the time and place of the hearing and notify the taxpayer thereof by mail. The hearing shall be conducted in accordance with the procedures for hearing contested cases in the Seattle Administrative Code (Chapter 3.02 of the Seattle Municipal Code).

 C. In all appeals, the Finance Director's assessment or refund denial shall be regarded as prima facie correct. The Hearing Examiner may, by subpoena, require the attendance of any person at the hearing, and may also require him or her to produce pertinent books and records. Any person served with such a subpoena shall appear at the time and place therein stated and produce the books and records required, if any, and shall testify truthfully under oath administered by the Hearing Examiner as to any matter required of him or her pertinent to the appeal; and it shall be unlawful for him or her to fail or refuse to do so. The City Attorney shall seek enforcement of a Hearing Examiner subpoena in an appropriate court.

 D. The Hearing Examiner may reverse or modify an action of the Director and ascertain the correct amount of the tax, fee, interest, or penalty due if the Director's assessment or refund denial violates the terms of this chapter. The decision of the Hearing Examiner shall be final and conclusive unless the decision is reversed or remanded on judicial appeal. The taxpayer, any other person beneficially interested, ~~and/~~ or the Finance Director ~~may~~ )) shall only~~seek~~ )) obtain judicial review of the decision of the Hearing Examiner by applying for a Writ of Review  in the Superior Court of Washington in and for King County in accordance with the procedure set forth in Chapter 7.16 RCW and other applicable law and local court rules within fourteen (14) days from the date of the decision.

 Section 2. This ordinance shall take effect and be in force thirty (30) days from and after its approval by the Mayor, but if not approved and returned by the Mayor within ten (10) days after presentation, it shall take effect as provided by Municipal Code Section 1.04.020.
