 AN ORDINANCE relating to land use and zoning, rezoning property by amending the Official Land Use map, SMC Chapter 23.32, and Chapter 23.47, in response to the Central Area Neighborhood Plan.

 Whereas, the City Council finds that the rezoning established by this ordinance will protect and promote the health, safety and welfare of the general public, and implement the Central Area Action Plan II, and

 Whereas, the Council has 1) considered proposed rezone J3, 2) determined that significant conditioning is necessary to ensure any new development's compatibility with the surrounding area if the property is rezoned from L2 and LDT to Lowrise 3, and that the appropriate means for such conditioning is through a property use and development agreement (PUDA), 3) decided to table further consideration of this rezone pending a proposal to include conditioning, and 4) will continue its consideration of this legislative rezone proposal as part of the neighborhood planning process at a later time,
