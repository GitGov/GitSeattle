 WHEREAS, the Authority, Market merchants, farmers, craftspersons, performers, other vendors, and Market residents, as well as the public generally will benefit from a clarification of Market operations; now, therefore, the parties agree as follows:

 Section 1. Purpose. The purpose of this agreement is to preserve the historic qualities of the Pike Place Market, assure its economic viability, and promote good management and harmonious relationships among Market users. This objective is to be accomplished by encouraging to the extent possible: (1) the sale of fresh produce by farmers; (2) the traditional use of the Market as an incubator for small businesses of all kinds but especially those that involve the sale of items personally crafted by the seller; (3) the sale of goods affordable to low and moderate-income people; (4) a variety of social services and housing opportunities for City residents, especially those with low incomes; (5) a mix of businesses which will provide a variety of goods and services particularly to Seattle residents but also to visitors; and (6) performances by a variety of musicians, entertainers and artists.

 Section 2. Definitions. Unless the context requires a different interpretation, the following words and phrases shall be given the meanings specified below.

 "Artists and Craftspersons" means those individuals, as defined in the rules and regulations of the Authority, who sell permitted merchandise from the day stalls.

 "Authority" means the Pike Place Market Preservation and Development Authority.

 "Day Stall" means any space, booth, stand, table, box, shelf, or other device rented by the day from the Authority for the purpose of selling or offering for sale any article or service in the Market. Two daystalls assigned to a farmer shall constitute a standard Farm Table; one daystall assigned to an artist or craftsperson shall constitute a standard Craft Table.

 "Farmer" means those persons, as defined in the rules and regulations of the Authority, who grow or produce and sell permitted farm products from the day stalls.

 Fresh Produce means permitted farm products that are edible, freshly harvested, perishable in a short time period once offered for sale, and sold in raw not processed form-- especially fruits and/or vegetables.

 "Grandfathered Vendors" means those persons not qualifying as "farmers" or "artists and craftspersons" who have been selling the same merchandise in continuous operation in the Market since the day their stall areas were acquired by the City in 1974. A list of those persons found to qualify under this definition, and the merchandise they have been selling continuously since 1974, is attached hereto as Appendix A.

 "Historic Commission" means the Pike Place Market Historical Commission as defined in Section 3 of Ordinance 100475 (section 25.24.030 of the Seattle Municipal Code), now or as hereafter amended.

 "Historic District" means the Pike Place Market Historic District as defined in Section 2 of Ordinance 100475 (Section 25.24.020 of the Seattle Municipal Code), now or as hereafter amended.

 Seniority means the number of years a farmer or craftsperson has maintained a permit to sell in the Market and the frequency of attendance of the permitholder, as further defined in the Daystall Rules and Regulations. Seniority is an administrative tool used in the assignment of daystall space and the calculation of seniority may differ by priority group. Seniority shall not confer a guarantee of space or specific daystall location to the permitholder. Seniority shall rest with the permitholder based on compliance with rules and regulations, and as such, may not be assigned, shared or transferred other than as permitted in the Daystall Rules and Regulations.

 Section 3. Use of Market Space. The distribution of day stall space in the Market shall be as follows:

 A. All daystall space in the Market other than on the Desimone Bridge, the west side of the Market arcade north of the Desimone Bridge and the slabs between the arcade and Virginia Street shall be farm priority tables where farmers selling permitted farm products have first priority. Farmers may also sell supplemental farm products subject to restrictions on the time and the amount established by the rules and regulations of the Authority. In establishing such restrictions, the Authority shall take into consideration traditional practices and the traditional distinction between the growing season and the off-season.

 B. All daystall space in the Market on the Desimone Bridge, on the west side of the arcade north of the Desimone Bridge and outside slabs between the arcade and Virginia Street shall be craft priority tables where Artists and craftspersons selling permitted merchandise and grandfathered vendors selling the merchandise set forth in Appendix A shall be given first priority for space.

 Artists, craftspersons and grandfathered vendors shall have second priority for selection of space on farm priority tables, farmers shall have second priority for selection of space on craft priority tables.

 C. Day stalls shall be of approximately uniform frontage (taking account of architectural features) of not less than four feet which shall be established by the Authority by regulation. The Authority shall establish a rental schedule for rental of day stalls; Individual farmers, artists, grandfathered vendors, craftspersons may rent one or more adjoining stalls as permitted by the rules and regulations of the Authority. When a user rents more than one day stall, the rental rate for the additional day stall or stalls may be different from the rental rate for the initial day stall; provided, however, that the rental schedule shall not discriminate between individual farmers, artists, craftspersons, or grandfathered vendors.

 D. All farmers shall be assigned a standard space of two adjoining daystalls. Farmers selling a diversity of fresh produce may be assigned three adjoining daystalls, if surplus daystalls for which farmers have first priority are available with all farmers assigned two daystalls. During the Holiday season, farmers may be limited to one table if, in the estimations of the Market Master doing so would benefit the seller community and consumers without undue hardship on the farmer.

 E. The Authority shall adopt rules and regulations governing day stall use, consistent with the requirements of the this Agreement, to determine: (1) the application and qualification requirements for day stall use, which shall include proof and periodic verification that the seller is a farmer, artist, or craftsperson, if the seller so contends; (2) the method by which day stall space will be assigned to individual farmers, artists, craftspersons, grandfathered vendors and other vendors, including the application of seniority in the assignment of daystall space and procedures for suspension or revocation of day stall use privileges for violations of the terms of this Agreement or the rules and regulations promulgated by the Authority; (3) the methods for distribution of unassigned daystall space in the off- season after assignment of the standard farmtables and crafttables; (4) the terms and procedures under which day stall users may use employees or agents to represent them; and (5) consistent with the requirements of the Commission, the time and manner in which goods will be displayed. At the time that the Authority gives notice to the public of such proposed rules and regulations and rules and regulations proposed for adoption pursuant to Section 3 and 6 of this Agreement, the Authority shall submit to the Historic Commission a copy of such proposed rules and regulations. At or before the final public hearing on the proposed rules and regulations, the Historic Commission may transmit proposed modifications, deletions, or alternative regulations ("changes") to the Authority.

 The Authority must, prior to adoption, secure the Commission's approval of any rule or regulation defining or altering the definition of any term as provided in Section 2 of this Agreement. In taking action to approve or disapprove any proposed changes to these definitions, the Commission shall refer to its enabling ordinance, guidelines and administrative procedures.

A reasonable permit fee may be charged.

 C. Permits when issued shall be evidenced by a badge that shall be worn or displayed by the performer in plain view at all times during a performance.

 D. Permits shall be valid for the calendar year in which the permit is issued unless revoked by the Market Master as provided below. A performer shall be entitled to only one permit, which shall not be transferable.

If the hearing is conducted by a committee, the findings of the committee shall be transmitted to the Council, which shall make the final decision.

 Section 9. Grievances.
