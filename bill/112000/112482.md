 WHEREAS, the North West Power Pool has authorized the incorporation of a non-profit corporation, the Pacific Northwest Security Coordinator, to effect such coordination by entering into contracts with the individual control area operators in the Pacific Northwest; and

 WHEREAS, Seattle operates a control area in the region which depends on the reliability of the interconnected Pacific Northwest transmission network; NOW, THEREFORE

Seattle's potential economic exposure under this Agreement is limited by two provisions. First, The Agreement provides for an annual cap on the costs Seattle would have to bear as a result of complying with any directives from the Security Coordinator, after which Seattle would be able to refuse any further directives for the remainder of the year. Second, the Agreement provides that Seattle may terminate the Agreement at any time on thirty days' notice.
