If the building official finds that the work as described in an application for a permit and the plans, specifications and other data filed therewith substantially conforms to the requirements of this code and other pertinent laws and ordinances and that the fees specified in the Fee Subtitle have been paid, the building official shall issue a permit therefor to the applicant who becomes the permit holder or authorized agent.

 EXCEPTION: The building official may issue a permit for the construction of part of a building or structure before complete plans for the whole building or structure have been submitted or approved, provided that the proposed project complies with the State Environmental Policy Act as adopted by the City (Chapter 25.05 Seattle Municipal Code) and as amended and the Land Use Code as amended; and provided further that adequate information and plans have been filed and checked to assure compliance with all pertinent requirements of this and other pertinent codes. The holder of such a permit shall proceed at his/her own risk without assurance that the permit for the entire building or structure will be granted.

 117.1.2 Compliance with Approved Plans and Permit. When the building official issues a permit, the building official shall endorse the permit in writing and endorse in writing or stamp the plans "APPROVED." Such approved plans and permit shall not be changed, modified or altered without authorization from the building official, and all work shall be done in accordance with the approved plans and permit except as the building official may require during field inspection to correct errors or omissions.

 117.1.3 Amendments to the Permit. When substitutions or changes are made during construction, approval shall be secured prior to execution, however, the building inspector may approve minor modifications for work not reducing the structural strength and fire and life safety of the structure. The building inspector shall determine if it is necessary to revise the approved plans. These substitutions and changes shall conform to the requirements of this code and other pertinent laws and ordinances. Minor substitutions or changes shall be documented, but shall not incur additional fees if these substitutions and/or changes do not (1) add to the general scope of work; (2) change the basic design concept; (3) involve major relocation of equipment, ducts, or pipes; (4) substantially alter approved equipment size; (5) require extensive re-review of the plans and specifications.

 All other changes, substitutions, or clarifications shall be shown on two sets of plans which shall be submitted to and approved by the building official prior to execution or occupancy. These submittals shall be accompanied by appropriate fees as specified in the Fee Subtitle prior to issuance of the Certificate of Occupancy.

 117.1.4 Cancellation of Permit Application. An application shall be deemed abandoned and void if a permit is not issued after a period of sixty days from the date of notice of approval for issuance or if corrections are not received after a period of sixty days from the date of notification of required corrections; provided that the building official may extend the period for issuance or submission of corrections if it is determined that there are good reasons for the delay, such as litigation or appeals or if a different schedule is agreed upon in writing before the end of the sixty day period. If the permit application is canceled, the site may be inspected to verify that no work has taken place. The application and any accompanying plans and specifications shall be destroyed. If the application is being reviewed concurrently with a master use permit application, and is for a project vested to a prior Land Use Code, and the project does not conform with the codes in effect while it is being reviewed, cancellation of the building permit application under the provisions of this section shall cause the concurrent cancellation of the Master Use Permit application.

 117.2 Retention of Plans. One set of approved plans, which may be on microfilm, shall be retained by the building official. One set of approved plans shall be returned to the applicant, and shall be kept at the site of the building or work at all times during which the work authorized is in progress for use by the inspection personnel.

 117.3 Validity of permit. The issuance or granting of a permit or approval of plans shall not be construed to be a permit for, or an approval of, any violation of any of the provisions of this code or other pertinent laws and ordinances. No permit presuming to give authority to violate or cancel the provisions of this code shall be valid, except insofar as the work or use which it authorizes is lawful.
