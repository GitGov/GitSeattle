 ORDINANCE ______

 AN ORDINANCE relating to land use and zoning, repealing SMC 23.60.604 (A) (2) to prohibit new single-family dwelling units over water along portions of Seaview Avenue Northwest.

 Whereas, in 1986 the Seattle Shoreline Master Program was amended to provide that new single-family dwellings may be permitted as a shoreline conditional use over water along portions of Seaview Avenue Northwest between 34th Avenue Northwest and Northwest 57th Street, and

 Whereas, in 1999 the National Marine Fisheries Service listed chinook salmon as a threatened species pursuant to the requirements of the Endangered Species Act, and

 Whereas, chinook salmon are found in the waters of the City of Seattle, including "Salmon Bay", and

 Whereas, the City Council intends to take appropriate actions to protect and enhance the environment for fish and other wildlife, including in particular, the threatened chinook salmon, and

 Whereas, the construction of residences in and over the waters of Salmon Bay may be harmful to fish and fish habitat, and should not be allowed, and

 Whereas, the shorelines of the City are a unique and scare resource which should generally be reserved for water-dependent or water- related uses, and that single-family residences may be located elsewhere in the City without the need to preclude more appropriate, water uses from the shoreline,

 NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT ORDAINED BY THE CITY OF SEATTLE AS FOLLOWS:

 Section 1. SMC 23.60.604 (A) (2) is hereby repealed.

 Section 2. This ordinance shall take effect and be in force thirty (30) days from and after its approval by the Mayor, but if not approved and returned by the Mayor within ten (10) days after presentation, it shall take effect as provided by Municipal Code Section 1.04.020.

 Passed by the City Council the _____ day of ____________, 1999, and signed by me in open session in authentication of its passage this _____ day of _________________, 1999.
