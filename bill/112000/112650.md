 WHEREAS, on December 15, 1997, the City and the Port entered into a Memorandum of Understanding regarding the Port's operations at the Bell Street Pier that addressed various issues between the City and the Port but left outstanding the issues of foam fire suppression capabilities of the City Fire Department and cruise ship fueling operations at the Bell Street Pier; NOW, THEREFORE,
