 AN ORDINANCE adding a new section 4.20.440 to the Seattle Municipal Code, adopting a Power Marketing Compensation Program and creating 8 new positions and reallocating 5 existing positions.

 BE IT ORDAINED BY THE CITY OF SEATTLE AS FOLLOWS:

 Section 1. There is added to Seattle Municipal Code Chapter 4.20 a new Section 4.20.440, as follows:

 4.20.440 Power Marketing Compensation ProgramDescription

 There is established a Power Marketing Compensation Program to which positions identified as "Power Marketer" will be assigned. The Personnel Director is authorized to implement the Power Marketing Compensation Program substantially in accord with the "Power Marketer Classification, Compensation and Sales Revenue Reward Plan Summary," which is incorporated by this reference. Revisions to titles and compensation components must be approved by the City Council. The title and pay zone established for the Power Marketer Compensation Program are:

 TITLE PAY ZONE

 Power Marketer $24.90 - $43.20

 B. The Personnel Director shall recommend to the City Council for approval a market adjustment to the pay zone based on a labor market analysis to be conducted at least biennially.

 C. The Personnel Director will recommend to the City Council the assignment of each position within the Power Marketer category to this pay zone, and will establish criteria for subsequent allocation of positions to and withdrawal of positions from the Power Marketing Compensation Program.

 D. Each employee appointed to a position within the Power Marketing Compensation Program will be assigned a base rate of pay within the pay zone by the appointing authority. If the rate of pay received by an incumbent immediately prior to assignment to the Power Marketing Compensation Program is higher than the upper limit of the pay zone recommended by the Personnel Director, or is higher than the rate established for the position by the appointing authority upon program implementation, the employee will retain an incumbency rate of pay until any market adjustments to the pay zone equal or exceed the incumbency rate; provided, the incumbency rating shall be maintained only as long as the duties assigned to the position are commensurate with the rate of pay.

 E. Establishing Sales Revenue Reward Plan. Up to 10% of individual base pay may be awarded as a Power Marketing Team Reward in accordance with the "Sales Revenue Reward Plan", which is incorporated by this reference. The specific provisions of awarding performance pay are outlined in the Sales Revenue Reward Plan. Any lump sum payment made pursuant to this section shall be considered a part of regular compensation, prorated annually for purposes of withholding retirement contributions and determining retirement benefits for affected employees who are members of the City Employees Retirement System.

 Section 2. Reallocating of positions. As recommended by the Personnel Director in Classification Determinations specified and attached hereto, positions in certain City employing units are hereby reallocated, effective as noted in respective Classification Determinations as shown below:

 City Light 1 position (#012706) of Power Dispatcher, Sr. reallocated to Power Marketer (Report #98-2203).

 1 position (#014205) of Power Dispatcher, Asst. reallocated to Power Marketer (Report #98-2203).

 1 position (#015293) of Economist, Sr. reallocated to Power Marketer (Report #98-2203).

 1 position (#018505) of Power Analyst, Sr. reallocated to Power Marketer (Report #98-2203).

 1 position (#019573) of Power Analyst, Sr. reallocated to Power Marketer (Report #98-2203).

 Section 3. Establishing New Positions. As requested by the City Light Superintendent and recommended by the Personnel Director, there are hereby created eight (8) positions (#026169, 026170, 026171, 026172, 026173, 026174, 026175 and 026176) in the City Light Department with the job title of Power Marketer, effective as noted in respective Classification Determination report #98-2191, Exhibit A.

 Section 4. City Light will conduct a comprehensive review and assessment of the Power Marketing Compensation Program 18 months following implementation. The results of this review review will be reported to the Council Committee responsible for oversight of the City's utilities.

 Section 5. It is the express intent of the City Council that, in the event another ordinance has heretofore been enacted that amended any section or subsection of the Seattle Municipal Code amended or recodified herein, that earlier amendment should be effectuated with equal dignity to this ordinance if at all possible in the codification of the Seattle Municipal Code and by the courts, notwithstanding the use in this ordinance of an obsolete version of that part of the Seattle Municipal Code on which to show intended amendments.

 Section 6. It is the express intent of the City Council that, in the event a subsequent ordinance refers to or amends a section or subsection of the Seattle Municipal Code amended or codified herein, but the later ordinance fails to account for the change made by this ordinance, the two sets of amendments should be given effect together if at all possible.

 Section 7. It is the express intent of the City Council that this ordinance makes only those changes to the Seattle Municipal Code shown by striking out, inside double parentheses, text to be deleted, and underlining text to be added. To this end, errors in showing the pre-existing Seattle Municipal Code are to be disregarded, and no change in the Seattle Municipal Code is intended thereby.

 Section 8. The several provisions of this ordinance are declared to be separate and severable and the invalidity of any clause, sentence, paragraph, subdivision, section, or portion of this ordinance, or the invalidity of the application thereof to any person or circumstance, shall not affect the validity of the remainder of this ordinance or the validity of its application to other persons and circumstances.

 Section 9. This ordinance shall take effect and be in force thirty (30) days from and after its approval by the Mayor, but if not approved and returned by the Mayor within ten (10) days after presentation, it shall take effect as provided by Municipal Code Section 1.04.020.
