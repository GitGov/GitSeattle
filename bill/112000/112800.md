 AN ORDINANCE relating to the 1999 Adopted Budget of the Office of Housing; increasing expenditure authority for multifamily programs by reducing expenditure authority for the REACH home loan program and making new appropriations; extending a revolving fund and carrying forward certain appropriations for the REACH program; and authorizing changes to the Consolidated Plan, all by a three-fourths vote of the City Council.

 WHEREAS, the City holds balances in certain funds maintained for the REACH home loan program in excess of needs anticipated in the near future; and

 WHEREAS, there is a pressing need for additional funds for development of affordable multifamily housing for low-income families; and

 WHEREAS, the Mayor and Director of the Office of Housing have proposed that certain balances be reprogrammed and made available for multifamily housing projects; NOW, THEREFORE,

 BE IT ORDAINED BY THE CITY OF SEATTLE AS FOLLOWS:

 Section 1. The expenditure authority of the Office of Housing for multifamily rental housing programs in the 1999 Adopted Budget is hereby increased by the amount of THREE MILLION DOLLARS ($3,000,000), by the following reductions, reappropriations and new appropriations, hereby made and authorized:

Reductions in 1999 Appropriations for REACH Program:

 REACH General Subfund: $1,200,000

 Housing and Community Development Revenue Sharing Fund: $908,000

 Total $2,108,000

 Appropriations for multifamily housing:

REACH General Subfund:

Reappropriation of reduction in REACH program appropriation: $1,200,000

 New appropriation: 800,000

 Subfund Total: $2,000,000

Housing and Community Development Revenue Sharing Fund

 Reappropriation of reduction in REACH program appropriation: $908,000

 New appropriation out of REACH program income: $92,000

 Subfund Total $1,000,000

 Total Added Appropriation for Multifamily Housing $3,000,000

 The funds appropriated under this Section shall be used for loans to projects selected by the Director of the Office of Housing that provide family housing as defined in the Administrative and Financial Plan for the 1995 Housing Levy ("A&F Plan"). Projects proposed in response to a previous Notice of Funding Availability and projects proposed in accordance with other processes outlined in the A&F Plan shall be eligible for these funds.

 Section 2. The intent of the appropriation in the Housing and Community Development Revenue Sharing Fund authorized in section 1 of this ordinance is to reduce the size of the revolving fund established in Section 6 of Ordinance 117472 for Community Development Block Grant ("CDBG") program income generated by the REACH program, but not to terminate such revolving fund. Unexpended and unencumbered balances of the appropriations of CDBG program income under Section 6 of Ordinance 117472, and of appropriations in the 1999 Adopted Budget for the REACH program, shall carry forward from year to year until expressly abandoned by ordinance. All CDBG program income received from the REACH program after December 31, 1999 shall continue to be credited to the revolving fund for the REACH program and is hereby appropriated for the purposes set forth in Section 6 of Ordinance 117472 and in this section, up to a cumulative dollar limit (including all funds expended under that Section, but not including funds appropriated in annual budgets) of $2 million. The Director of the Office of Housing is authorized to cause the payment to the United States of interest earned on deposit balances in the revolving fund, consistent with federal laws and regulations.

 Section 3. Unexpended and unencumbered balances of the appropriations in this ordinance shall carry forward from year to year unless expressly abandoned by ordinance.

 Section 4. The Director of the Human Services Department is authorized and directed, in consultation with the Director of the Office of Housing, to make the changes in the City's Consolidated Plan that are necessary or appropriate to give effect to the intent of this ordinance. Such changes shall include changes in the dollar amounts allocated to the REACH program and to multifamily housing in the City's Action Plan and a revision to the allocation guidelines to reflect the changes in dollar allocations. The Director of the Office of Housing is authorized, for and on behalf of the City, to approve projects for the use of funds appropriated under this ordinance and to enter into, perform, modify, enforce, and administer agreements for loans or grants of such funds to public and private owners and developers of low-income housing.

 Section 5. The foregoing appropriations are made to meet actual necessary expenditures of the City for which insufficient appropriation has been made due to causes which could not reasonably have been foreseen at the time of the making of the 1999 budget; therefore, in accordance with RCW 35.32A, by reason of the facts above stated, this ordinance shall take effect and be in force thirty (30) days from and after its approval by the Mayor, but if not approved and returned by the Mayor within ten (10) days after presentation, it shall take effect as provided by Municipal Code Section 1.04.020.
