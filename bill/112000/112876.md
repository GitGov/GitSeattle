 Section 2. To implement the contract modification authorized in Section 1 hereof, and contingent upon the full execution of such agreement, the expenditure allowance for Program Category "F30 Fire Operations" in the 1999 Budget of the Seattle Fire Department is increased in the sum of Two Hundred Thousand Dollars ($200,000) by the appropriation, hereby made and authorized, of a like sum from the Supplemental Appropriation Account of the Emergency Subfund of the General Fund to the appropriate expenditure allowance in the Fire Department budget.
