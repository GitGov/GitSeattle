 CAPITAL FACILITIES ELEMENT

 C. FORECAST OF FUTURE NEEDS FOR CAPITAL FACILITIES

 This section does not apply to transportation capital facilities; please see that element of the Plan for pertinent discussion.

 Seattle is a highly urbanized area with a fully developed citywide network of the types of capital facilities necessary to accommodate growth. New households that are projected to locate in Seattle could occupy existing dwellings or new buildings. New buildings can be constructed in Seattle, and be served by the existing network of streets, water and sewer lines, drainage facilities and electrical grid. In addition, new residents can be served by existing and funded police, fire and school facilities. Forecasted future needs for police and fire protection and schools both for the six and twenty year timeframes are listed in Appendix A to this element of the Plan. Forecasted future needs for water, drainage and wastewater, City Light and solid waste facilities are discussed in Appendix A of the Utilities Element. The capital programs to meet these forecasted six year needs are included in the City of Seattle Adopted ~~1999~~ 2000-2005~~4~~ Capital Improvement Program (CIP).

 The City currently provides a good citywide system of libraries, parks and recreation facilities which are available and accessible for use by all the City's residents. An inventory of these facilities is also contained in Appendix B to this element. While additions to these facilities would enhance the City's quality of life, such additions are not necessary to accommodate new households. It is expected that during the neighborhood planning process, additions or expansions of these facilities may be identified. The City's ability to add to or expand these facilities will depend on neighborhood prioritization, funding availability and the willingness of residents to approve financing.

 The City also provides other facilities, such as general government buildings, Seattle Center and Public Health facilities that are of a citywide or regional benefit. While upgrading or replacement of some of these facilities may be funded over the next six years, such improvements are not necessitated by projected growth.

 Source materials for the capital facilities and utilities analysis may be found in documents from the Fire, Police, ~~Water, Engineering, Administrative Services~~, ~~Solid Waste Utility~~, Seattle City Light, Seattle Public Utilities, Seattle Transportation, Executive Services, and Parks and Recreation Departments and the School District, as updated by the Neighborhood Designation Package for each urban village. A compilation of these documents is available at the City's Office of Management and Planning and the downtown Seattle library. (Section amended 11/94, 7/95, 11/95, 11/96, 9/97, 11/97, 11/98, 11/99

 D. PROPOSED NEW OR EXPANDED CAPITAL FACILITIES

 Projects or programs identifying the proposed locations and capacities of the new or expanded capital facilities the City contemplates funding in the next six years, are listed in Appendix C of the ~~1999-2004~~ 2000-2005 CIP. Project and program descriptions are contained in the departmental sections in the body of the CIP. These descriptions are incorporated herein. Consistent with the overall plan, emergencies, other unanticipated events or opportunities, and voter approvals of ballot measures, may result in some departure from the adopted CIP. Other potential capital improvements that the City may fund over the next six years are found in Appendix D to this element. Additional information for transportation is found in that element. (Section amended 11/94, 7/95, 11/95, 11/96, 11/97,11/98, 11/99

 E. SIX-YEAR FINANCE PLAN

 Six year financing plans for new or expanded facilities are contained in the departmental sections in the body of the CIP. These plans are incorporated herein. These capital allocations may change over time. Emergencies and unanticipated circumstances may result in allocating resources to projects not listed. The CIP contains substantial funding for major maintenance and some funding for other improvements that will both maintain and enhance the City's existing facilities. Additional information for transportation is found in that element. (Section amended 11/94, 7/95, 11/95, 11/96, 11/97, 11/98, 11/99

 F. CONSISTENCY AND COORDINATION

 Current projections show that probable funding will be sufficient to meet all the currently identified needs for new or expanded city capital facilities through the year 2005~~4~~ to accommodate planned growth. Should anticipated funding not materialize, or should new needs be identified for which no funding is determined to be probable, the City will reassess the land use element of this Plan to ensure that it is coordinated with and consistent with this element, and in particular with the six-year finance plan. A review for coordination and consistency between this Element and the Land Use Element will be part of the City's annual budget review and Comprehensive Plan amendment processes.
