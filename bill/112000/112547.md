 ORDINANCE ______

 AN ORDINANCE relating to the Elevated Transportation Company, directing Seattle Transportation to provide funds in 1999 for basic administrative costs of the Elevated Transportation Company; passed by a three-fourths vote of all the members of the City Council.

 WHEREAS, the voters of the City of Seattle, Washington ("City"), approved Initiative No. 41 (the Monorail Initiative) on November 4, 1997, creating the Elevated Transportation Company (ETC); and

 WHEREAS, the City Council by Ordinance 118902 authorized the appropriation of the sum of $200,000 for the ETC to pay for some basic administrative costs during the ETC's first year of operation, until February 17, 1999, and increased the 1998 budget of Seattle Transportation by this amount; and

 WHEREAS, Seattle Transportation and the ETC have entered into "Agreement No. A-01: Elevated Transportation Company Agreement", effective October 12, 1998, which outlines the terms and conditions under which the City is providing funds to the ETC; and

 WHEREAS, the 1999 Budget for Seattle Transportation includes $50,000 for basic administrative costs of the ETC; and

 WHEREAS, Seattle Transportation has unexpended 1998 budget authority remaining from this appropriation which the Council has determined should carry forward into the 1999 budget of Seattle Transportation and continue to be made available to the ETC for basic administrative costs, in addition to the funds already provided for this purpose in the 1999 Budget; and

 WHEREAS, state law provides, in RCW 35.21.730(1), that a city may transfer funds, property, and services to a public corporation such as the ETC, with or without consideration; and

 WHEREAS, the City Council has determined that making additional funds available in 1999 for a portion of the ETC's estimated basic administrative costs will facilitate the ETC's ability to fulfill its purpose, which is declared to be a public purpose of the City;

 NOW, THEREFORE,

 Section 1. In cooperation with the ETC, the Director of Seattle Transportation is authorized to extend the termination date of the agreement between the City and the ETC entitled "Agreement No. A-01: Elevated Transportation Company Agreement" until no later than December 31, 1999. In cooperation with the ETC, the Director shall amend that agreement as necessary to cover the conditions of use for any city funds to be used for basic administrative costs of the ETC in 1999. If under the agreement moneys are transferred to the ETC prior to their use, the agreement shall call for the return to the City of amounts not used for such basic administrative costs by December 31, 1999. The agreement shall require an accounting to the City by the ETC of the ETC's expenditure funds provided by the City.

 Section 2. There shall be available to the Director of Seattle Transportation, from within the 1999 budget of Seattle Transportation and in addition to the funds already provided in the 1999 budget for Seattle Transportation for this purpose, additional funding for a portion of the basic administrative costs of the ETC in 1999. The amount of the additional funding available to the Director shall be the sum of Two Hundred Thousand Dollars ($200,000), or so much thereof as may be necessary, less the sum of the amount transferred by Seattle Transportation in 1998 to the ETC and the amount equal to the cost of services provided by Seattle Transportation to the ETC prior to January 1, 1999. The Director shall use these additional available funds to transfer funds to the ETC and to pay the costs of services provided by Seattle Transportation to the ETC, in accordance with Agreement No. A-01: Elevated Transportation Company Agreement between the City and the ETC, as amended by the Director and the ETC.
