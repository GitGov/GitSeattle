 AN ORDINANCE relating to transferable development rights; authorizing the sale by the City of development rights acquired from low-income housing including the Fleming Apartments Project and the Dorothy Day Apartments Project and available for sale from the Benaroya Hall Music Center, a Major Performing Arts Facility; appropriating sales proceeds and related payments; authorizing related agreements and deeds; and ratifying and confirming prior acts, all by a vote of three-fourths of all the members of the City Council.

 WHEREAS, under the City's Downtown Land Use Code certain properties, including those developed with low-income housing and with Major Performing Arts Facilities, are eligible to transfer unused development rights; and

 WHEREAS, by Ordinance 114029, as amended, the City has established a "TDR Bank" and authorized the Director of the Office of Housing ("Housing Director") as the successor to the housing functions of the former Department of Housing and Human Services to negotiate the sale of transferable development rights ("TDRs") from such low-income housing; and

 WHEREAS, by Ordinance 119051 the City Council authorized certain agreements with respect to the sale of up to 423,000 s.f. of TDRs from the Benaroya Hall Major Performing Arts Facility site ("MPAF TDRs") and the proceeds thereof; and

 WHEREAS, pursuant to Ordinances 119023 and 119097 the City acquired 58,468 s.f. of TDRs from low-income housing sites, the Fleming Apartments and the Dorothy Day Apartments, respectively; and within the twelve months following the adoption of this ordinance, the City expects to acquire further housing TDRs up to a total of 100,000 s.f. of TDRs;

 WHEREAS, the developer of a proposed office project ("Buyer") has offered to purchase 380,000 s.f. of TDRs for use in accordance with the City's Land Use Code; the Housing Director in consultation with the Director of the Executive Services Department has negotiated the terms of sale; and the Housing Director has recommended that the negotiated terms be accepted; Now, Therefore,

 BE IT ORDAINED BY THE CITY OF SEATTLE AS FOLLOWS:

 Section 1. The Housing Director is authorized, for and on behalf of The City of Seattle, to execute, deliver, perform, administer, and enforce an agreement for the sale of up to Three Hundred Eighty Thousand (380,000) square feet of TDRs ("Agreement") on substantially the terms set forth in Exhibit A to this Ordinance, with such additional terms and conditions as the Housing Director shall find to be appropriate to effect the intent of this ordinance. The TDRs to be sold derive from the properties described on Exhibits B-1 through B-3 to this Ordinance and may derive from such other properties as may be approved by the City Council. Upon performance by the purchaser in accordance with the terms of the Agreement, the Housing Director is further authorized to execute and deliver deeds to the TDRs sold, substantially in the forms of Exhibits B-1 through B-3 to this Ordinance; provided, that if consistent with the Agreement the purchaser elects to acquire fewer than the full amount of TDRs authorized, then the Housing Director is authorized to deliver a deed or deeds for the lesser amount, and the order in which TDRs from the respective properties are sold shall be consistent with the agreement authorized pursuant to Ordinance 119051, taking into account any other City sales of TDRs. The intent of this ordinance is that 280,000 s.f. of MPAF TDRs shall be sold if the purchaser buys the maximum amount authorized; however, the Director may sell additional MPAF TDRs if there are less than 100,000 s.f. of housing TDRs available for sale thirty days in advance of the anticipated closing date. The proceeds of sale of the MPAF TDRs (Exhibit B-1) shall be deposited in the Development Rights Subfund of the General Fund. The proceeds of sale of the remaining TDRs (Exhibits B-2, B-3, and any other housing property pursuant to further Council authorization) shall be deposited in Fund 164, Subfund 30, which is the TDR/Mitigation Subfund. Earnest money shall be deposited in the Finance Director's Clearing Account, and interest earned thereon shall accrue to such account, until such time as earnest money is applied to the purchase price or the City becomes entitled to retain earnest money as liquidated damages. Any earnest money and interest earned thereon that the City becomes entitled to retain (other than as part of the purchase price), shall be transferred to the two subfunds identified above pro rata in proportion to the number of square feet of TDRs intended to be sold from each type of property (280,000 sq. ft. from the MPAF and 100,000 sq. ft. from housing); provided, that if the purchaser shall have acquired a portion of the TDRs, then the proration of earnest money shall be adjusted to reflect only the unsold TDRs of each type.

 Section 2. The Housing Director or her designee is hereby authorized, for and on behalf of the City, to negotiate, execute, deliver, record, accept, modify, perform, and administer, as appropriate, any additional documents contemplated by the Agreement or that may be necessary or appropriate to implement the intent of the Agreement or this Ordinance.

 Section 3. Funds deposited into Fund 164, Subfund 30 pursuant to this Ordinance, up to the amount of $1,340,000, are hereby appropriated for the development and preservation of low-income housing in downtown Seattle.

 Section 4. Funds deposited into the General Fund, Development Rights Subfund, and interest earned thereon, in an amount up to $3,752,000, are hereby appropriated from the Development Rights Subfund to the General Bond Interest and Redemption Fund for the purposes of retiring, at such times and in such manner as the Finance Director shall deem appropriate, all or portions of the City's 1998 Series D bonds issued pursuant to Ordinance 119042 and any other any debt incurred by the City for the purpose of refunding such bonds, provided that to the extent the amounts deposited in such Subfund, together with proceeds of MPAF TDRs sold under other ordinances and appropriated for the same purposes, shall exceed the amounts owing on the 1998 Series D bonds and any debt incurred to refund such bonds, such excess funds are hereby appropriated for the purpose of satisfying the obligations assumed by the City under Ordinance 119051.

 Section 5. The City Council finds that the non-financial consideration described in Exhibit A in the form of goals for contracting with women and minority-owned businesses and employment opportunities for low income workers in connection with the Project is in the public interest. Buyer shall require its general contractor to establish goals for the award of contracts to Women and/or Minority Business Enterprises and to establish goals for apprenticeship opportunities. Buyer will require the general contractor to include anti-discrimination clauses in the subcontracts for construction of the Project.

 Section 6. Any actions pursuant to the authority of this Ordinance and prior to its effective date are hereby ratified and confirmed.

 Section 7. Unexpended and unencumbered balances of appropriations in this ordinance

 carry forward from year to year until expressly abandoned by ordinance.

 Section 8. The foregoing appropriations are made to meet actual necessary expenditures of the City for which no appropriation has been made due to causes which could not reasonably have been foreseen at the time of the making of the 1999 budget; therefore, in accordance with RCW 35.32A, by reason of the facts above stated, this ordinance shall take effect and be in force thirty (30) days from and after its approval by the Mayor, but if not approved and returned by the Mayor within ten (10) days after presentation, it shall take effect as provided by Municipal Code Section 1.04.020.
