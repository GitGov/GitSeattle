 a. Millennium and LP shall comply with all requirements of Seattle Municipal Code 21.60, Franchise Ordinances Nos. 118361 and 117955, and all related applicable orders, contracts, agreements, commitments, side letters and regulatory actions.

 b. Millennium and LP shall take steps to ensure a continued local management presence within King County by maintaining management level positions in network administration, customer service and support, construction engineering, and high speed data services, and support staff sufficient to fulfill all franchise responsibilities.

 c. Millennium acknowledges that the issue of open access to its high speed cable modem services by Internet and On-Line service providers is currently being assessed at the national and local levels. To protect the City's role in that assessment, Millennium agrees that restrictions on open access to the cable system may, at the City's discretion, constitute an occurrence that shall be grounds for the City to reopen the franchise agreements under Section 20 of the Franchise Agreements, but only to the extent permitted under federal law.

 d. Millennium agrees to assume responsibility for any and all non-compliance under the Franchise Agreements that may now exist or may later be discovered to have existed during the terms of the Franchise Agreements, even if prior to the closing of this transaction.

 e. Millennium agrees to comply fully with all franchise provisions and to meet or exceed all applicable federal, state and local requirements, including but not limited to those relating to franchise fees and taxes, rebuild and buildout requirements, customer service standards, Internet access, PEG obligations, and the system technical standards.

 f. Millennium agrees that within thirty days of the completion of this transfer, it will submit an updated corporate organization chart identifying the roles of the current Summit managers in the new Millennium organization.

 Section 2. This consent to transfer granted under this ordinance shall not become effective for any purpose unless and until Millennium accepts the conditions of this ordinance and such acceptance is filed with the City Clerk and Office of Cable Communications. Such acceptance shall be in writing, shall be in a form and substance approved by the City Attorney, and shall be and operate as an acceptance of each and every term and condition and limitation contained in this ordinance, SMC Ch. 21.60, or in the Franchise Agreements, or otherwise specified as provided in this section.

 Section 3. In the event that the transaction or transactions which are the subjects of this ordinance do not close for any reason, or in the event that such transaction or transactions close on terms substantially and materially different from the terms described in the FCC Form 394 and subsequent information provided to the City by Summit and Millennium and relied upon by the City, then the consent provided for in Section 2 shall be null and void.

 Section 4. Any acts consistent with and prior to the effective date of this Ordinance are hereby ratified and confirmed.

 Section 5. This ordinance shall take effect and be in force thirty (30) days from and after its approval by the Mayor, but if not approved and returned by the Mayor within ten (10) days after presentation, it shall take effect as provided by Municipal Code Section 1.04.020.
