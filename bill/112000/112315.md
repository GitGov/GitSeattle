 AN ORDINANCE relating to the parking garage located between Sixth and Seventh Avenues and Pine and Olive Streets in downtown Seattle; establishing the Parking Garage Operations Fund with regard to that garage; assigning responsibility for operation of that garage to the Executive Services Department; authorizing an amendment to the Condominium Declaration relating to that garage; and authorizing waiver of certain terms in the Umbrella and Parking Agreements relating to that garage.

 WHEREAS, on February 12, 1996, the City Council passed Ordinance 118011, authorizing the City to lease or otherwise acquire a parking garage (the "Garage") located on property bounded by Sixth and Seventh Avenues and Pine and Olive Streets (commonly known as the "Systems Block") and located beneath the retail and entertainment complex commonly known as "Pacific Place", and authorizing the Mayor to sign an "Umbrella Agreement" and a "Parking Agreement" substantially in the forms attached thereto; and

 WHEREAS, the City has entered into the Umbrella Agreement and Parking Agreement authorized by Ordinance 118011; and

 WHEREAS, on October 21, 1996, the City Council passed Ordinance 118348, authorizing the Mayor to sign an amendment to the Umbrella Agreement, and the City has entered into that amendment; and

 WHEREAS, on May 26, 1998, the City Council passed Ordinance 119013 authorizing the Mayor to sign an amendment to the Parking Agreement, and the City has entered into that amendment; and

 WHEREAS, on October 21, 1996, the City Council passed Ordinance 118349, authorizing a Condominium Declaration to divide the property on the Systems Block, now known as Pacific Place, into a "Garage Unit" and a "Retail Unit"; and

 WHEREAS, the Umbrella Agreement, as amended, requires the City to lease or otherwise acquire the Garage when certain conditions are met, including having the Garage open to the public for parking for six months, having a major national retailer open in the former Frederick & Nelson Building for at least two months, having all of the public spaces and at least 150,000 square feet of gross leasable area in the Retail Unit of Pacific Place open for business, and certifying that the marketing and training program for the "pay on foot" aspect of Garage operations has been completed for at least one month; and

 WHEREAS, the Garage opened to the public on May 23, 1998; and

 WHEREAS, Nordstrom opened its new flagship store in the former Frederick & Nelson Building on August 21, 1998; and

 WHEREAS, it appears that Pine Street Development will open all public spaces and at least 150,000 square feet of gross leasable area in the Retail Unit of Pacific Place during October 1998, and will complete the marketing and training program for the "pay on foot" Garage by mid-October 1998; and

 WHEREAS, it therefore appears likely that the City will be required to lease or otherwise acquire the Garage in November 1998; and

 WHEREAS, it may not be optimal for the City to take responsibility for Garage operations in the fourth week of November, so close to the onset of the peak holiday shopping season; Now, Therefore,

 BE IT ORDAINED BY THE CITY OF SEATTLE AS FOLLOWS:

 Section 1. The Parking Garage Operations Fund is hereby established. The Fund shall receive all revenue from the parking garage located between Sixth and Seventh Avenues and Pine and Olive Streets beneath the Pacific Place retail complex in downtown Seattle (the "Garage"). The Fund may receive other monies as authorized by ordinance. All operating expenses of the Garage shall be paid from the Fund. Moneys shall be transferred from the Fund to the General Bond Interest and Redemption Fund to make periodic debt service payments. The Fund shall receive earnings and pay interest on its positive and negative balances. The Executive Services Director shall have responsibility for administering the Fund.

 Section 2. The Executive Services Department is hereby assigned responsibility for operations of the Garage in accordance with the terms of the Umbrella Agreement and Parking Agreement authorized by Ordinance 118011, as those agreements may be amended or supplemented from time to time.

 Section 3. The Executive Services Director is hereby authorized to approve minor changes to the Condominium Declaration authorized by Ordinance 118349. Such changes may include, but are not limited to, transfer of small areas such as stairwells between the units and the establishment of new common areas. No change that would substantially affect the value of the Garage Unit may be made unless approved by ordinance.

 Section 4. In order to facilitate a smooth transfer of operational responsibility for the Garage to the City prior to the onset of the peak winter holiday shopping season, the Mayor is authorized to waive the condition contained in the Amendment of the Umbrella Agreement dated as of December 2, 1996, (as authorized by Ordinance 118348) that at least six months elapse between the date the Garage is first open to the general public for parking and the date the Garage is leased or otherwise transferred to the City. Any such waiver will be limited so that the date of transfer to the City shall be on or after November 16, 1998, and not later than November 25, 1998. The Mayor is also authorized to waive other minor terms, requirements, or conditions related to the transfer of the Garage to the City that are contained in the Umbrella Agreement, Parking Agreement, or amendments thereto, if such waivers do not materially affect the amounts paid or the benefits received by the City. The Mayor will consult with the President of the City Council and the Chair of the Council Finance and Budget Committee prior to authorizing any such waivers.

 Section 5. Any acts consistent with the authority but prior to the effective date of this ordinance are hereby ratified and confirmed.

 Section 6. This ordinance shall take effect and be in force thirty (30) days from and after its approval by the Mayor, but if not approved and returned by the Mayor within ten (10) days after presentation, it shall take effect as provided by Municipal Code Section 1.04.020.
