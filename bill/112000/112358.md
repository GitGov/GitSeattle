 BE IT ORDAINED BY THE CITY OF SEATTLE AS FOLLOWS:

 Section 1. General Municipal and Firefighters' Pension.

 A. (i) There is hereby levied a tax on all taxable property, both real and personal, within the City of Seattle and subject to taxation under the laws of the State of Washington, in the amount (subject to the limits stated in subsection 1.B) of One Hundred Seventy-five Million, Three Hundred Ninety-five Thousand, Five Hundred Seven Dollars ($175,395,507), which has been calculated at the rate of Three Dollars and Sixty Cents ($3.60) per thousand dollars of the estimated assessed value of such property. This tax is levied for the purpose of raising revenue to finance the various departments and activities of the municipal government of the City of Seattle for the fiscal (calendar) year 1999. This levy has been calculated at the following dollar rates per thousand dollars of assessed value: Three Dollars and Fifteen Cents ($3.15) for general municipal purposes as allowed by RCW 84.52.043; Twenty-two and One-half Cents ($0.225) for the Firemen's Pension Fund as allowed by RCW 41.16.060; and Twenty- two and One-half Cents ($0.225) for general municipal purposes as allowed by RCW 41.16.060. This levy includes an amount of Eight Hundred Twenty-eight Thousand Dollars ($828,000) for low-income housing that is not restricted to serving very low-income households, in accordance with Ordinance 117711; an amount of Six Million, Two Hundred Forty-six Thousand Dollars ($6,246,000) to renovate and develop facilities at the Seattle Center and to develop five Parks Department community recreation centers in accordance with Ordinance 115593; and an amount of Fifteen Million Dollars ($15,000,000) for educational and developmental services in accordance with Ordinance 118557.

 (ii) In addition, there is also hereby levied a tax on all taxable property, both real and personal, within the City of Seattle and subject to taxation under the laws of the State of Washington, in the amount of Seven Million, Six Hundred Thirty Thousand, Seven Hundred Sixteen Dollars ($7,630,716), such tax being levied for the purpose of financing affordable housing for very low-income households pursuant to RCW 84.52.105, pursuant to Ordinance 117711, which tax levy shall be outside of and in addition to the limitations in RCW 84.52.043.

 B. If the total of the amounts of taxes stated in subsections 1.A(i) and (ii) or the tax rate necessary to generate that amount of taxes would be in excess of any maximum allowed by law or by vote of the people of the City of Seattle pursuant to RCW 84.55.050, then such taxes shall be reduced to the maximum amount allowed or the amount computed by applying the maximum rate to the value of the taxable property. The maximum amount of regular property taxes allowed by vote of the people shall be determined for purposes of this subsection as follows: There shall be determined the amount of regular City property taxes that could have been levied for collection in 1998 had the voters approved none of the levy lid lift measures submitted pursuant to RCW 84.55.050 and Ordinances 115593, 117711, and 118557. Then, to that amount shall be added the three (3) dollar amounts set forth in the last sentence of subsection 1.A(i) as authorized for 1999 collection by the voters of the City pursuant to RCW 84.55.050 and those enumerated ordinances, plus the dollar amount set forth in subsection 1.A(ii).

 Section 2. Pursuant to Chapter 3, Laws of 1997, as approved by the voters of the state on November 4, 1997, and pursuant to Resolution 29719 adopting the City Council's and Mayor's top budget priorities for the 1999-2000 budgets and in order to carry out those budget priorities and the 1999-2004 Capital Improvement Program, the City Council finds that there is a substantial need to use one hundred and six percent (106%) as the regular property tax limit factor, formerly known as the "106% lid", for regular property taxes to be collected in 1999.

 Section 3. Voter-approved excess taxes for bonds. In addition, a further tax is hereby levied to raise revenue to provide for the interest on and redemption of voter-approved general obligation bonds for the fiscal year 1999 in the amount of Eleven Million, Seven Hundred and Eighty-two Thousand, Seven Hundred and Forty Dollars ($11,782,740). This tax is applicable to all taxable property within the City of Seattle.

 Section 4. Severability. The several provisions of this ordinance are declared to be separate and severable and the invalidity of any clause, sentence, paragraph, subdivision, section, subsection, or portion of this ordinance, or the invalidity of the application thereof to any person, property, or circumstance, shall not affect the validity of the remainder of this ordinance or the validity of its application to other persons, property, or circumstances.

 Section 5. Ratification and confirmation of prior acts. Any act consistent with the authority and prior to the effective date of this ordinance is hereby ratified and confirmed.

 Section 6. Effective date. This ordinance shall take effect and be in force thirty (30) days from and after its approval by the Mayor, but if not approved and returned by the Mayor within ten (10) days after presentation, it shall take effect as provided by Municipal Code Section 1.04.020.
