 BE IT ORDAINED BY THE CITY OF SEATTLE AS FOLLOWS:

 Section 1. The Seattle Municipal Code section 21.04.280 is hereby amended to read as follows:

 A. As used in this section, the following words shall have the following meanings:

 "Eligible project" means any housing development or redevelopment project in The City of Seattle that receives a HUD utility allowance, in which at least fifty (50) percent of the dwelling units will be affordable to and will be occupied by households with aggregate annual incomes no higher than fifty (50) percent of median income.

 "Median income" means annual median income for the Seattle-Everett Metropolitan Statistical Area, adjusted for household size, as provided from time to time by the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD). If HUD ceases to provide such estimates no less frequently than annually, then "median income" shall mean such comparable figure for the Seattle area or an area including Seattle, published or reported by a federal, state, or local agency, as the City shall select in its sole discretion.

 "Public infrastructure" means the water, wastewater and/or drainage infrastructure that is required to be (a) constructed or installed under SMC Section 21.04.060 B, SMC Section 21.16.270 B and/or SMC Chapter 23.53, respectively, and any rules or policies that may be promulgated thereunder; and (b) transferred to the City upon completion of construction.

 B. For housing development or redevelopment projects certified by the Office of Housing as eligible projects and that are required to construct public infrastructure, Seattle Public Utilities shall, prior to December 31, 2003, fund the actual cost of the public infrastructure prorated according to the percentage of dwelling units that will serve households with aggregate annual incomes no higher than fifty (50) percent of median income; provided that the property owner installs water and electric meters (or submeters, as applicable) in the eligible project and that all public infrastructure and all meter work is performed in a manner acceptable to Seattle Public Utilities. An amount equal to such funding shall be recovered through increased water, wastewater and drainage charges established by ordinance. The Office of Housing shall certify only those projects that meet the criteria of eligible projects and that also demonstrate to the satisfaction of the Office that the property owner will comply with all applicable state law, including without limitation public bidding and prevailing wage laws, and with all applicable City law, including without limitation laws pertaining to the prevention of discrimination and women and minority business enterprises. The Office of Housing, in agreement with Seattle Public Utilities, is hereby authorized to develop rules and procedures for certification of, and follow-up reporting by eligible projects to ensure that they satisfy the intent of the ordinance codified in this section.

 Section 2. The Seattle Municipal Code subsection 21.04.060.B is hereby amended to read as follows:

 B. In case of application for water service to supply premises not abutting upon a street in which there is a standard City water main, the Director will require construction of a standard water main abutting the property before a connection is made: provided; that under certain conditions, a temporary connection may be provided for the property, or a service to the property of the applicant may be placed along and beneath any public street or avenue; and provided further, that in the case of certain housing development or redevelopment projects for households with aggregate annual incomes no higher than fifty (50) percent of median income, the Director shall, prior to December 31, ~~1999~~2003, in accordance with SMC 21.04.280 fund a portion of the costs of construction of a standard water main. The Director, pursuant to the Administrative Code (Chapter 3.02), shall establish criteria and procedures for making the aforementioned exceptions.

Unless authorized by the Director of Seattle Public Utilities, an owner or occupant who is required, or wishes, to connect to a public sewer shall be required to build a main sewer line extension if a public sewer is not accessible within an abutting public area, or if the building, habitable structure, plumbing outlet or source of polluted water is more than two hundred feet (200') from the public sewer. In the case of certain housing development or redevelopment projects for households with aggregate annual incomes no higher than fifty (50) percent of median income, the Director shall, prior to December 31, ~~1999~~2003, in accordance with SMC 21.04.280 fund a portion of the costs of construction of a main sewer line extension.
