 AN ORDINANCE relating to the proposed Municipal Civic Center; authorizing the Executive Services Department to move forward with programming for the various City facilities that will comprise the Civic Center; authorizing schematic design of a new City Hall and continued design of a new Municipal Courthouse that will include a Police Headquarters; creating a new fund in the City Treasury and closing an existing fund; making an appropriation for funding such programming and design; and authorizing an internal loan to support that appropriation; all upon a three-fourths vote of the City Council.

 WHEREAS Ordinance 118757, passed in October 1997, authorized design of a new Municipal Court building and analysis of other associated development on the same site for municipal and other purposes, created a new fund to track expenditures on the project, made an appropriation for funding such design and analysis, and authorized an interfund loan to support that appropriation; and

 WHEREAS Ordinance 118757 established in the City Treasury the "Municipal Courthouse Fund" to track expenditures related to design and feasibility studies in connection with the new Municipal Courthouse; and

 WHEREAS Resolution 29789, adopted in July 1998, provided City Council guidance on planning for a Municipal Civic Center to include a new City Hall to house the Mayor, the Council, and key customer service functions and directed that the new Municipal Courthouse should include space for Police administration and King County District Court; and

 WHEREAS locating the King County District Court in the same facility with the Seattle Municipal Court has been determined to be infeasible at this time; and

 WHEREAS housing the Seattle City Attorney's Criminal Division in the Municipal Courthouse has been determined to be advantageous because of the Division's need for close proximity to the Court; and

 WHEREAS inclusion of space for police administration in the new Municipal Courthouse has resulted in that facility being commonly referred to as the Municipal Courthouse and Police Headquarters; and

 WHEREAS Ordinance 118757 adopted a preliminary schedule that anticipates occupancy of the Municipal Courthouse and Police Headquarters in the first quarter of 2002, with demolition of the Public Safety Building in the second quarter of 2002; and the City Council has subsequently expressed its interest in exploring the possibility of constructing the new City Hall in tandem with the courthouse; and

 WHEREAS in order to meet the desired schedule for the buildings, it is necessary immediately to begin programming and design for the new City Hall and to continue design for the new Municipal Courthouse and Police Headquarters, thereby making it necessary to provide interim financing for the various programming and design components, to be reimbursed from longer-term financing which is anticipated by the middle of 1999; and

 WHEREAS selling municipal bonds now is not the most cost effective or timely way to finance the programming and design components; and

 WHEREAS there will be sufficient cash in the City's consolidated cash pool to support a loan, as contemplated in subsection 5.06.030E of the Seattle Municipal Code, to the project fund to support further programming and design; and

 WHEREAS the consolidated cash pool will earn market rate interest on the loan until such time as longer term financing is secured and the project fund is no longer in a negative cash position;

 NOW THEREFORE:

 BE IT ORDAINED BY THE CITY OF SEATTLE AS FOLLOWS:

 Section 1. As recommended by the Mayor, the Executive Services Director is authorized to move forward with programming for the Municipal Civic Center, including the new City Hall. The Executive Services Director is further authorized to proceed with the schematic design of a new City Hall on the east half of the Municipal Building site, and to continue with the design of a new Municipal Courthouse and Police Headquarters that will also include space for the City Attorney's Criminal Division, but not for the King County District Court, on the "Cordes site."

 Section 2.

 A. There is hereby established in the City Treasury a "Municipal Civic Center Fund" for all capital activities in connection with the Municipal Civic Center. The fund will include at least the following three subfunds:

 The "Municipal Courthouse Subfund," into which will be deposited the moneys to be used for the planning, design, and construction of the new Municipal Courthouse and Police Headquarters, and from which all expenditures for those purposes shall be made; and

 The "City Hall Subfund," into which will be deposited the moneys to be used for the planning, design, and construction of the new City Hall, and from which all expenditures for those purposes shall be made; and

 The "Master Plan Subfund," into which will be deposited the moneys to be used for the planning, design, and construction of all other capital improvements that will be implemented as a result of the Municipal Civic Center master plan. Such improvements may include but are not limited to programming and design for occupying Key Tower or renovating and occupying the historic buildings, and programming and design for renovating and occupying facilities for the units of the Police Department that will not move to the new Municipal Courthouse and Police Headquarters.

 Investment earnings on balances in this fund will be retained by the fund. The Finance Director may rename and reorganize these subfunds and may create additional subfunds and accounts as needed to facilitate accounting for activities in connection with the Municipal Civic Center.

 B. The Municipal Courthouse Fund created by Ordinance 118757 shall be closed and all its appropriations, assets, and liabilities are hereby transferred to the Municipal Courthouse Subfund created in this section.

 Section 3. To pay for the costs of programming and design authorized in Section 1, the sum of Eight Million Three Hundred Fifty Thousand Dollars ($8,350,000) is appropriated from the Municipal Civic Center Fund.

 Section 4. To support the appropriation made in Section 3, a loan from the City's consolidated cash pool to the Municipal Civic Center Fund is authorized in the maximum amount of Eight Million Three Hundred Fifty Thousand Dollars ($8,350,000). This loan shall be effectuated by allowing the Municipal Civic Center Fund to be in a negative cash position pending receipt of proceeds from longer term project funding expected to be obtained by the sale of general obligation debt prior to construction of a new Municipal Courthouse and Police Headquarters and a new City Hall, or obtained from other sources. The loan shall last no longer than December 31, 2001, unless extended by subsequent ordinance. The Municipal Civic Center Fund shall pay interest on the borrowed funds at a rate that reflects the earnings of the consolidated cash pool on its other investments. The Finance Director is hereby authorized to execute any necessary loan documents and make fund transfers as necessary.

 Section 5. All acts consistent with the authority and prior to the effective date of this ordinance are hereby ratified and confirmed.

 Section 6. The foregoing appropriation is made to meet actual necessary expenditures of the City for which insufficient appropriations have been made due to causes which could not reasonably have been foreseen at the time of the adoption of the 1998 Budget; Now, Therefore, in accordance with RCW 35.32A.060, by reason of the facts above stated this ordinance shall take effect and be in force thirty (30) days from and after its passage and approval, if approved by the Mayor, but if not approved and returned by the Mayor within ten (10) days after presentation, it shall take effect as provided by Municipal Code Section 1.04.020.
