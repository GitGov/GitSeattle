 AN ORDINANCE relating to the impoundment of vehicles, amending Sections 11.30.040, 11.30.120, 11.30.160, 11.30.290, and 11.30.320 and adding a section to Chapter 11.30 of the Seattle Municipal Code.

 BE IT ORDAINED BY THE CITY OF SEATTLE AS FOLLOWS:

 Section 1. The City adopts the legislative findings of Washington Laws of 1998, chapter 203, section 1.

 Section 2. The City Council finds that parking on the public right- of- way is regulated to promote traffic safety, enhance the smooth flow of traffic and, in certain areas of high demand for parking such as business districts, to fairly allocate parking spaces among the public by limiting parking time. Parking is also metered or limited in business districts to facilitate commerce by promoting frequent turnover for shopping rather than commuter or long-term parking, as well as to generate revenue from the use of the public right-of-way. Although the great majority of those receiving parking tickets respond appropriately, some vehicles are repeatedly ticketed for uncontested parking violations which are then not paid. Not only do such repeated violations defeat the purposes of the parking regulations, but they also deprive the City of significant revenue. In 1997, vehicles with three or more delinquent parking tickets owed the City more than $19 million in unpaid fines and penalties, including $7.5 million accrued by vehicles with 13 or more delinquent parking tickets each. Further revenue is lost insofar as many of these violations reflect parking at meters that were thus unavailable to drivers who would have paid for their parking had the space been available. The magnitude and intractability of this parking scofflaw problem has made it a local situation calling for a solution that will remove these vehicles from the public right-of-way to allow others to make lawful use of available parking spaces. Because a substantial number of parking violations are accrued by chronic offenders whose violations remain delinquent despite efforts by the Municipal Court to collect unpaid fines it is necessary to authorize impoundment of illegally parked vehicles with multiple outstanding delinquent tickets in order to effectively enforce the City's parking regulations.

 Section 3. Section 11.30.040 of the Seattle Municipal Code (Ordinance 108200 Section 2 (11.30.040), as last amended by Ordinance 117306 Section 3) is further amended to read as follows:

 11.30.040 When a vehicle may be impounded without prior notice.

 A. A vehicle may be impounded with or without citation and without giving prior notice to its owner as required in Section 11.30.060 hereof only under the following circumstances:

 1. When the vehicle is impeding or is likely to impede the normal flow of vehicular or pedestrian traffic; or

 2. When the vehicle is illegally occupying a truck, commercial load zone, bus, loading, hooded-meter, taxi, or other similar zone where, by order of the Director of Engineering or Chiefs of Police or Fire, parking is limited to designated classes of vehicles or is prohibited during certain hours, on designated days or at all times, and where such vehicle is interfering with the proper and intended use of such zones; or

 3. When a vehicle without a special license plate, card, or decal indicating that the vehicle is being used to transport a disabled person as defined under Chapter 46.16 RCW, as now or hereafter amended, is parked in a stall or space clearly and conspicuously marked as provided in Section 11.72.065 A, as now or hereafter amended, whether the space is provided on private property without charge or on public property; or

 4. When the vehicle poses an immediate danger to the public safety; or

 5. When a police officer has probable cause to believe that the vehicle is stolen; or

 6. When a police officer has probable cause to believe that the vehicle constitutes evidence of a crime or contains evidence of a crime, if impoundment is reasonably necessary in such instance to obtain or preserve such evidence; or

7. When a vehicle is parked in a public right-of-way or on other publicly owned or controlled property in violation of any law, ordinance, or regulation and there are ~~three (3)~~four (4) or more parking infractions issued against the vehicle for each of which a person has failed to respond, failed to appear at a requested hearing, or failed to pay an adjudicated parking infraction for at least forty-five (45) days from the date of the filing of the notice of infraction.

 B. Nothing in this section shall be construed to authorize seizure of a vehicle without a warrant where a warrant would otherwise be required.

 Section 4. Chapter 11.30 of the Seattle Municipal Code (Ordinance 108200, as amended) is further amended by adding the following section:

 11.30.105 Impoundment of vehicle where driver is arrested for a violation of Section 11.56.320 or 11.56.340 -- Period of impoundment.

 A. Whenever the driver of a vehicle is arrested for a violation of Section 11.56.320 or 11.56.340, the vehicle is subject to impoundment at the direction of a police officer.

 C. If a vehicle is impounded because the driver is arrested for a violation of Section 11.56.320 D and the Washington Department of Licensing's records show that the driver has been convicted two (2) or more times of a violation of RCW 46.20.342 or similar local ordinance within the past five (5) years, the vehicle shall be impounded for thirty (30) days.

 D. If a vehicle is impounded because the driver is arrested for a violation of Section 11.56.320 B or C and the Washington Department of Licensing's records show that the driver has not been convicted of a violation of RCW 46.20.342(1)(a) or (b) or similar local ordinance within the past five (5) years, the vehicle shall be impounded for thirty (30) days.

 F. If a vehicle is impounded because the driver is arrested for a violation of Section 11.56.320 B or C and the Washington Department of Licensing's records show that the driver has been convicted of a violation of RCW 46.20.342(1)(a) or (b) or similar local ordinance two (2) or more times within the past five (5) years, the vehicle shall be impounded for ninety (90) days.

 Section 5. Section 11.30.120 of the Seattle Municipal Code (Ordinance 108200 Section 2 (11.30.120), as last amended by Ordinance 117306 Section 7) is further amended to read as follows:

 11.30.120 Redemption of impounded vehicles.

C. The Chief of Police is authorized to release a vehicle impounded pursuant to Section 11.30.105 prior to the expiration of any period of impoundment upon petition of the spouse of the driver, or the person registered pursuant to Ordinance 117244 as the domestic partner of the driver, based on economic or personal hardship to such spouse or domestic partner resulting from the unavailability of the vehicle and after consideration of the threat to public safety that may result from release of the vehicle, including, but not limited to, the driver's criminal history, driving record, license status, and access to the vehicle. If such release is authorized, the person redeeming the vehicle still must satisfy the requirements of Section 11.30.120 A and B.

D.~~C.~~ Any person seeking to redeem a vehicle impounded as a result of a parking or traffic citation has a right to a ~~Municipal Court~~ hearing before an administrative hearings officer to contest the validity of an impoundment or the amount of removal, towing, and storage charges or administrative fee if such request for hearing is in writing, in a form approved by the Chief of Police~~Municipal Court~~ and signed by such person, and is received by the Chief of Police within ten (10) days (including Saturdays, Sundays, and holidays) of the latter of the date the notice was mailed to such person pursuant to Section 11.30.100 A or B, or the date the notice was given to such person by the registered tow truck operator pursuant to RCW 46.55.120(2)(a)~~Municipal Court within the time period specified in SMC Section 11.31.050 A, as now or hereafter amended~~.

Such person shall have the right to a hearing~~ within two (2) business days (excluding Saturdays, Sundays and holidays)~~Monday through Friday)~~ of the written request ~~to the court~~ for hearing.

 3.
