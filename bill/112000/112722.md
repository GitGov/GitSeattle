 AN ORDINANCE relating to the Community Development Block Grant Float Loan Program; authorizing a short-term loan of up to Three Million Five Hundred Twenty Thousand Dollars ($3,520,000) in Block Grant funds to a partnership formed by Sand Point Community Housing Association, for a low-income housing project involving the rehabilitation of officer and enlisted quarters at the decommissioned Sand Point Naval Base; authorizing related agreements; and authorizing amendment of the City's Consolidated Plan.

 WHEREAS, the City Council, by Ordinance 116402, adopted policies for short-term loans of Community Development Block Grant ("CDBG") funds, known as "CD Float Loans"; and

 WHEREAS, in order to provide low-income housing for the homeless, and pursuant to Ordinance 118770, The City of Seattle has leased to the Sand Point Community Housing Association ("SPCHA"), a Washington non-profit corporation, certain land acquired from the United States Navy at the former Naval Station Puget Sound at Sand Point under a lease for fifty-one years ("Lease"), and has conveyed certain former buildings thereon to SPCHA for the life of the Lease;

 WHEREAS, SPCHA has subleased portions of the land and deeded the buildings known as Buildings 26 North, 26 South and 224 ("Buildings") to Sand Point Housing Associates I Limited Partnership, a Washington limited partnership organized by SPCHA ("Partnership") in order to raise equity funds from tax-credit investors to finance part of the cost of rehabilitation in order to provide 26 units of family housing and 41 units of single room occupancy housing; and

 WHEREAS, the Partnership will rehabilitate the Buildings, with loans and grants from the City of Seattle Office of Housing, State of Washington Housing Trust Fund, HUD McKinney Act Supportive Housing Program, and Federal Home Loan Bank, and will receive additional permanent funding for rehabilitation expenses from tax credit investors and a bank loan, but requires a low- interest construction loan in order to complete the financing for this project; and

 WHEREAS, the City's Director of the Office of Economic Development has proposed that the City provide a short term loan from CDBG funds to the Partnership (the "Loan"); and

 WHEREAS, the housing rehabilitation will satisfy the CD Float Loan policies, and the City's Loan Committee has approved the proposed Loan in accordance with those policies; and

The amount of up to THREE MILLION FIVE HUNDRED TWENTY THOUSAND DOLLARS ($3,520,000) is hereby appropriated from the Housing and Community Development Revenue Sharing Fund for such purpose.

 Section 2. The Loan shall be payable upon the earliest of (i) twenty-four months; (ii) demand by the City (which may be for partial payments), or (iii) the dates on which sufficient funds are available from tax credit equity investment and/or permanent debt financing to make payment, in accordance with terms to be negotiated by the OED Director and included in the final Loan Agreement.

Payments of interest on the Loan and principal repayments shall be deposited in the Housing and Community Development Revenue Sharing Fund, and may be expended pursuant to any past or future appropriations of CDBG funds, whether in the annual budget or otherwise, unless such other appropriations are limited by their express terms to CDBG program income from other programs.

 Section 9. The Director of the Human Services Department is authorized to amend the City of Seattle's 1999 Consolidated Plan and to take such other actions as are appropriate to implement the intent of this ordinance under HUD regulations, and to provide necessary assurances to HUD.

The Housing Director is further authorized, for and on behalf of the City, to execute, deliver, record, and modify such other documents as shall be reasonably required in order clearly to establish the subleased parcels as separate legal lots under State law and City ordinances.
