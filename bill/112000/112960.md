 Early Implementation Fund

 Evaluation using Criteria established in Resolution 29783

 Applicant: Rainier Beach

 Criterion 1: The project must be a high priority element of a proposed neighborhood plan that has been through the community validation process or a neighborhood plan for which the Council has taken final action on the approval and adoption package. The project must be discrete and have a defined product or outcome that is likely to be completed within two years. Funds may be used as seed money for conceptual or detailed engineering design, or for a phase of a project

 Mapes Walk Concept Design and Partial Build - This project corresponds to recommendation

 C-2.3.3 in the matrix. The project proposes to contract with a landscape architect for a refined conceptual design for Mapes Walk ($5,000). The expected completion date for this project is spring 2000. The balance of the funding ($15,000) will be held aside for construction of an initial phase of walkway redevelopment. That portion should be completed by the end of 2000. DON's budget authority will be increased by $20,000 and the funds will be disbursed to the Friends of Lake Washington Apartments for project implementation pursuant to the scope of work and contract negotiated with DON and as consistent with this ordinance.

 Education Goals Analysis & Community Education Summit - This project is an element of Key Strategy C-3 in the matrix. The project proposes three activities related to education support for Rainier Beach youth and adults: 1) A review of the Neighborhood Plan's education goals for consistency and action steps; 2) A community summit on education to be held in spring 2000 focusing on the Neighborhood Plan actions steps, Washington State Education Reform, and resources for area students; 3) Grant writing to support a future Learning Center proposed in the plan for Rainier Beach. The expected completion date for these projects is summer 2000. DON's budget authority will be increased by $25,000 and the funds will be disbursed to the Rainier Beach Complex Advisory Council for project implementation pursuant to the scope of work and contract negotiated with DON and as consistent with this ordinance.

 Implementation Newsletter and Outreach Support In support of Plan implementation and to solidify the community building that took place during planning, the Rainier Beach Stewardship Committee will produce a regular publication highlighting implementation activities and opportunities for involvement in activities as well as in stewardship. In addition, the group will continue stewardship-related mailings (agendas, minutes, meeting notices, etc.). DON's budget authority will be increased by $5,000 and the funds will be disbursed to the Rainier Beach 2014 Stewardship Committee for project implementation pursuant to the scope of work and contract negotiated with DON and as consistent with this ordinance.

 Criterion 2: The project must be consistent with the Comprehensive Plan. The project must also be consistent with other adopted City plans, such as the Seattle Comprehensive Transportation Program and the Parks COMPLAN. If the project is subject to City regulatory standards, the project must meet or appear capable of meeting those standards.

 These projects are consistent with the Comprehensive Plan.

 Criterion 3: The project requires no or minimal increases in City staff or City contribution for ongoing operation and maintenance. The project must not duplicate an existing or planned project already included in a departmental CIP or operating budget.

 These projects can be accommodated with current staffing already dedicated to neighborhood plan implementation.

 Criterion 4: If the project is to be implemented by an entity other than the City, the entity must demonstrate that it has the capacity to implement the project in a timely manner, and propose measures the City can use to hold the entity accountable.

 The Rainier Beach Complex Advisory Council, the Rainier Beach 2014 Stewardship Committee and the Friends of Lake Washington Apartments have the capacity to implement these projects in a timely manner.
