 AN ORDINANCE relating to land use and zoning, amending Ordinance 119487 by clarifying the process for applying for a special exception and extending the moratorium on signs displaying animation or rapidly changing images or messages until December 1, 2000.

 BE IT ORDAINED BY THE CITY OF SEATTLE AS FOLLOWS:

 Section 1. The City Council hereby makes the following legislative findings of fact:

 a) On June 1, 1999 the City Council passed and on June 4, 1999 the Mayor signed Ordinance 119487 establishing a moratorium governing signs displaying animation or rapidly changing images or messages. The moratorium is scheduled to expire on December 1, 1999 or the effective date of new regulations relating to signs displaying animation or rapidly changing images or messages, whichever is sooner.

 b) Within sixty (60) days after adoption of Ordinance 119487 the City Council held a public hearing on the ordinance pursuant to the requirements of RCW 36.70A.390.

 c) By Ordinance 119487 the City Council authorized the Department of Design, Construction and Land Use to prepare a work plan to study appropriate regulations.

 d) Signs with the capability of displaying messages in this manner have been constructed in the City of Seattle, in neighboring jurisdictions, and in the City of Portland, and are currently being considered for development by sign owners and potential sign owners in Seattle.

 e) Additional time is needed for continuing study of these sign display methods and to develop legislation based on the study. Extending the moratorium period will prevent construction of this type of signs in a manner that could be contrary to the findings of the study and the intent of the eventual legislation.

 f) The City Council believes that it will take approximately twelve (12) additional months for DCLU to complete its work and for the Council to prepare, have hearings on and adopt any amendments they may deem appropriate to regulate these display methods.

 g) Continuing a moratorium on the use of these methods for displaying messages on signs does not change the number of signs allowed in the city, nor does it restrict content on signs because messages can be displayed using all methods currently allowed by the Sign Code.

 h) This Council therefore finds that the protection of the public health, safety, and welfare requires extending the moratorium on signs displaying animation or rapidly changing images or messages.

 Section 2. Section 2 of Ordinance 119487 is hereby amended to read: Through December 1, 2000 or until new regulations relating to the methods of display on signs enumerated in Section 3 of Ordinance 119487 take effect, whichever is sooner, no permit shall be issued, nor shall any master use permit application or sign permit application be accepted, for the methods of display described in Section 3, nor shall the display of messages using the methods enumerated in Section 3(a) be lawful on any existing sign, unless allowed by subsection B or C of Ordinance 119487.

 Section 3: Subsection C of Section 3 of Ordinance 119487 is hereby amended to read:

 C. Special Exception:

 For signs that meet standards set out in B1, B2 and B5 but do not meet standards set out either in B3 or B4, the Director of DCLU may grant a special exception pursuant to Chapter 23.76 of the Seattle Municipal Code for permit applications accepted after June 30, 1999 to allow such signs based on the applicant meeting all of the following standards to prevent the signs from contributing to traffic and pedestrian hazards and aesthetic blight.

 1. In addition to the requirements of B2, the sign shall be within the special exception area shown on the map attached as Exhibit A. In certain areas within these boundaries, including Special Review Districts, Historic Districts, Preservation Districts, residential zones and shoreline environments, as shown on the map attached as Exhibit A, the methods of display described in Section 3A are more likely to conflict with the intended character of those areas and are prohibited.

 2. Distance: The sign shall be a minimum distance of fifteen feet (15') from the street edge;

 3. Height: Pole signs shall be at least ten feet (10') above the ground;

 4. Screening: The method of displaying the message, including the motion displayed on the sign, the speed at which the message changes, and the light from the sign shall not distract motorists so as to contribute to traffic hazards.

 5. Hours of operation: The methods of display described in subsection A shall be limited to daylight hours; except that when used on an on-premises sign at a place of public assembly, such methods may be used after daylight, only during the event and within two hours before and one hour after the event.

 6. Sound: Audio speakers on the sign shall only broadcast information directly related to the image displayed on the sign. Hours of audio operation shall be the same as hours of operation of the sign. The volume of the audio shall be no greater than necessary to hear the message within ten feet (10').

 Section 4: Section 6 of Ordinance 119487 is hereby amended to read: This Ordinance expires December 1, 2000.

 Section 5. The workplan attached as Attachment 1 to this ordinance is hereby approved and adopted.

 Section 6. This ordinance shall take effect and be in force thirty (30) days from and after its approval by the Mayor, but if not approved and returned by the Mayor within ten (10) days after presentation, it shall take effect as provided by Municipal Code Section 1.04.020.
