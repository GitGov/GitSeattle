 AN ORDINANCE relating to the City Light Department; transferring jurisdiction over arterial streetlights from the General Fund to the Light Fund; providing for payment from the Light Fund to the General Fund for the physical assets transferred; and providing that following the transfer of assets, charges to the General Fund for these streetlights will be based on SMC 21.49.060(A) Schedule 48, Option II -- Utility-owned Fixtures.

 WHEREAS, the City Light Department has jurisdiction over approximately seventy-eight percent of the streetlights in the City, located primarily on residential streets; and

 WHEREAS, the General Fund has jurisdiction over most of the remaining twenty-two percent of the streetlights in the City, located primarily on arterial streets and managed by Seattle Transportation; and

 WHEREAS, City Light's experience in operating and maintaining the bulk of the streetlights in the City makes it better equipped than SEATRAN to upgrade and maintain arterial streetlighting at acceptable standards; NOW, THEREFORE,

 BE IT ORDAINED BY THE CITY OF SEATTLE AS FOLLOWS:

 Section 1. Effective December 31, 1999, jurisdiction over the approximately 18,600 streetlights currently under the jurisdiction of the General Fund, and located primarily on arterial streets in the City, shall be transferred from the General Fund to the Light Fund. The streetlight assets to be transferred include lights, fixtures, arms, poles, standards, bases, wire, and associated vaults, conduit and other appurtenances.

 Section 2. Upon transfer of these streetlight assets to the Light Fund, payment of $3,600,000.00 (three million, six hundred thousand dollars) shall be made from the Light Fund to the General Fund to compensate the General Fund for the transfer of assets. This payment reflects the current market value of the streetlight assets being transferred, based on City Light's calculation of depreciated replacement value, which calculation is concurred with by SEATRAN and hereby approved.

 Section 3. Following transfer of the streetlight assets to the Light Fund, billings for these streetlights shall be made under Seattle Municipal Code Section 21.49.060(A), Schedule 48, Option II -- Utility-owned Fixtures, and as may be amended or superseded, reflecting the fact that responsibility for maintenance and replacement of these transferred streetlight assets will have then shifted to the Light Fund.

 Section 4. This ordinance shall take effect and be in force thirty (30) days from and after its approval by the Mayor, but if not approved and returned by the Mayor within ten (10) days after presentation, it shall take effect as provided by Municipal Code Section 1.04.020.
