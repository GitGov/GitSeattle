 AN ORDINANCE relating to community and economic development; authorizing modification of security for a Section 108 loan and Urban Development Action Grant loan in order to facilitate refinancing of the Promenade 23 Shopping Center; accepting a deed for street purposes, and authorizing related agreements, amendments, and actions.

 WHEREAS, the Central Area Action Plan, adopted by the Seattle City Council through Resolution No. 28815 on January 3, 1994, recognized the Promenade 23 Shopping Center ("Center") as a critical neighborhood revitalization project; and

 WHEREAS, Ordinance 117877 authorized The City of Seattle to issue $2.4 million in non-recourse notes guaranteed by the Secretary of the Department of Housing and Urban Development ("HUD") under the Section 108 program to finance a loan ("Section 108 Loan") for expansion of the Center on the north side of Jackson St. in order to assist community and economic development in the Central Area;

 WHEREAS, the Section 108 Loan is secured by a first lien deed of trust on the property developed with that loan ("North Tract 1"), as specified by Section 4 of Ordinance 117877;

 WHEREAS, the City also holds a loan made from federal Urban Development Action Grant ("UDAG") funds for the development of the Center on the south side of Jackson St. (the "UDAG Loan");

 WHEREAS, under the terms of the UDAG loan as modified pursuant to Ordinance 115904, the City receives payments based on the net cash flow from the south portion of the Center after payment of debt service on a first mortgage from a private lender;

 WHEREAS, the owner of the Center ("Developer") has successfully completed the development financed by the Section 108 Loan;

 WHEREAS, the Developer has proposed a plan to refinance the private debt on the Center in order to reduce total debt service, improve cash flow and obtain a long-term fixed rate;

 WHEREAS, the Developer also intends to develop the remaining portion of the Center on the north side of Jackson St. ("North Tract 2") with private financing;

 WHEREAS, the UDAG loan modification agreement approved by Ordinance 115904 provided that the deed of trust to the City as beneficiary on the property north of Jackson Street would be released when the Developer proceeded with development of the entire north side property, and Developer has now agreed that such deed of trust shall not now be released;

 WHEREAS, the Director of the Office of Economic Development ("OED Director") has determined that refinancing as contemplated by the Developer's proposal will be in the best interests of the City, subject to certain conditions imposed by the Director, to negotiation of final terms, to review of appraisals and to necessary HUD approvals; NOW, THEREFORE,

The Plan may also include subordination of the UDAG deeds of trust on the North Tract 1, and the South Tract to a third lien position and of the UDAG deed of trust on the North Tract 2 to a second lien position, provided that the City's security for the UDAG Loan on North Tract 1 and North Tract 2 shall not be released until such time as a sale or refinancing of North Tract 2 occurs on terms that will satisfy all obligations to the City or that are otherwise acceptable to the OED Director.
