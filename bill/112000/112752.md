 AN ORDINANCE authorizing a Pilot Program for low-income households that are not billed by Seattle City Light for electricity.

 WHEREAS, the City of Seattle supports affordable housing efforts and providing assistance to low-income residents; and

 WHEREAS, SMC 20.76.010 authorizes a program of credits to partially offset billings for water, wastewater, drainage, and solid waste services for qualified low-income households by providing: (1) a credit on the Combined Utility Bill of 50% of the actual billings for these utilities to households that are directly billed by Seattle Public Utilities (SPU); and (2) providing a credit on the Seattle City Light (SCL) electric bill equal to an amount specified in SMC 20.76.040 for these utilities to households that are not directly billed by SPU; and

 WHEREAS, SMC 20.76.050 authorizes Seattle Public Utilities to provide a rent credit voucher equal to 50% of the aggregate average residential billing for water, wastewater, drainage and solid waste services to qualified low-income households that are not directly billed for any utility service; and

 WHEREAS, Seattle Public Utilities provides very few rent credit vouchers due to low utilization of the program; and

 WHEREAS, SMC 21.49.040 authorizes Seattle City Light to assist low- income households in paying for the cost of electricity by providing a credit on electric bills, but provides no assistance to otherwise eligible households that are not directly billed for any utility service; and

 WHEREAS, with regard to low-income households that are not directly billed for any utility service, the current City programs are not designed to, or in practice do not, adequately provide utility low- income rate assistance; and

 WHEREAS, the City Council adopted a statement of legislative intent that directed Seattle City Light and Seattle Public Utilities to assess implementation alternatives for a pilot program of rate assistance, with savings passed on to the tenants, for buildings owned by not-for-profit corporations serving low-income households; and

 WHEREAS, Seattle City Light and Seattle Public Utilities have recommended a pilot program to provide low-income rate assistance to households that are not directly billed for any utility service and that reside in buildings owned and operated by not-for-profit corporations;

 NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT ORDAINED BY THE CITY OF SEATTLE AS FOLLOWS:

 Section 1. Low-Income Rate Assistance Pilot Program. The City Council hereby authorizes a Low-Income Rate Assistance Pilot Program (as described in Attachment A, the "Pilot Program") that will deliver credits, on behalf of Income Eligible Households (as defined in Section 2) for electricity, water, drainage, wastewater, and solid waste utility services. Such credits shall be given in the form of utility credit vouchers to not-for-profit corporations that own residential buildings served under general service electric rates in which households are not directly billed for any utility services; provided, that upon entry into the Pilot Program such owners agree to reduce the rental payment due from Income Eligible Households in an amount equal to the credit voucher. The Director of the Human Services Department (HSD) is authorized and directed to administer the Pilot Program in cooperation with SCL, SPU, Executive Services Department (ESD), and building owners. Based on this ordinance and the requirements developed by the Director of HSD, participating building owners will determine the eligibility of households for the Pilot Program on an annual basis.

 For purposes of the Pilot Program, households will be eligible for electricity rate assistance if they meet the income qualifications under SMC 21.76.030.A1 - A4. The Superintendent of Seattle City Light is authorized to determine a credit for each such Income Eligible Household which shall be 50% of the estimated average per unit charge based on the actual historical electric usage for that building (excluding common areas) and current general service electric rates. The utility credit voucher for a building shall equal the amount so determined times the number of Income Eligible Households in that building. SCL shall provide such a voucher to each not-for-profit corporation that owns a residential building and agrees to comply with the requirements of this ordinance and the Pilot Program. For purposes of the Pilot Program, SPU shall provide a voucher in accordance with SMC 21.76.050.B to each not-for-profit corporation that owns a residential building and agrees to comply with the requirements of this ordinance and the Pilot Program.

 The utility credit vouchers: (1) shall be issued to such not-for- profit building owners that agree to make the rent reduction required by this ordinance; (2) shall not be redeemed in cash; and (3) shall be honored by the City only when applied to the City utility account through which the building owner pays for utility services provided to Income Eligible Households.

 Section 2. Definitions. For purposes of the Pilot Program, an Income Eligible Household means a household in which a member of the household: a) leases a dwelling unit in a building that is owned by a not-for-profit corporation and b) meets the income qualifications under SMC 21.76.030.A1 - A4. The dwelling unit may have its own bathroom and/or cooking facility or share bathrooms and/or cooking facilities with other units.

 Section 3. Reporting Requirements. HSD, SCL and SPU shall report to the Utilities and Environmental Management Committee of the City Council by no later than October 31, 2000 regarding the feasibility, program and administrative costs, efficiencies, and limitations of the Pilot Program described herein and in Attachment A.

 The building owners participating in the Pilot Program shall report to HSD at the end of twelve months with the information requested by HSD.

 Section 4. Term of Pilot Program. The Pilot Program authorized by this ordinance shall expire December 31, 2000.

 Section 5. Ratification of Prior Acts. All acts taken pursuant to the authority of this ordinance but prior to its effective date are ratified, approved and confirmed.

 Attachment A

 UTILITY RATE ASSISTANCE PROGRAM FOR LOW-INCOME HOUSEHOLDS

 The Pilot Program described here will provide utility rate assistance available from Seattle Public Utilities (SPU) and Seattle City Light (SCL) to eligible low-income households who are not billed directly for any utility service.

 Pilot Program Objectives

 1) Provide equal access by all eligible utility customers to utility rate assistance

 2) Provide assistance that is household-based in buildings where the household is not billed directly for any City utility service

 3) Maintain program design consistency with current utility rate assistance programs

 4) Expand the use of SPU utility credit vouchers to reach more eligible customers

 5) Authorize SCL to provide a utility credit voucher for income eligible households

 6) Create administrative efficiencies by working with not-for-profit corporations who own rental housing which serves income eligible households

 Program Description

 Duration of Pilot Program

 The pilot program will be in place for 17 months, August 1, 1999 through December 31, 2000.

 Eligibility Requirements For Households

 Households must reside in a building where they are not billed directly for any City utility service. Households may reside in a unit which has it own bathroom and/or cooking facility or shares a bathroom and/or cooking facilities with other units.

 In order to be eligible for utility rate assistance, households cannot: 1) be receiving any form of assistance which is intended to specifically offset the household's cost of utilities (i.e. Section 8 rent subsidies), or 2) reside in a building receiving any form of government assistance intended to offset the operating costs of the building (i.e. utility costs).

 Households must be income eligible. Income eligibility will be based on the requirements of SMC 21.49.040, A1 - A3 and SMC 21.76.030, A1- A4. (Elderly/disabled households must have incomes of less than 70% of State median income and non-elderly/non-disabled households must have incomes of less than 125% of the federal poverty level.)

 Households must reside in a building owned by a not-for-profit corporation served under general service electric rates who is willing to enter into an agreement with the City to provide household income information and receive a utility credit voucher on behalf of income eligible households. Income eligibility of households will be determined and documented by the not-for-profit building owners and approved by the Human Services Department (HSD).

 Utility Credit Amount

 The amount of utility credit for drainage, water, sewer, and garbage service for each eligible household will be consistent with credit amounts established by SPU in SMC 21.76.040.

 An estimated monthly per unit charge for electricity will be determined by SCL based on an analysis of the historical use of electricity for the building (excluding common areas) in which the income eligible household resides. The utility credit will be 50% of the estimated average per unit charge for that building based on current general service electric rates.

 Method of Receiving Credit and Recordkeeping

 Utility credit will be provided in the form of a utility credit voucher issued to the building owner on behalf of all income eligible households residing in the building. The amount of the voucher will be calculated as follows:

 1) The monthly per unit credit for drainage, water, sewer, and garbage, plus the monthly per unit credit for electricity

 2) Multiplied by the number of income eligible households in the building

 The building owner will provide each income eligible household with a monthly rent credit based on receipt of the utility credit voucher. The rent credit will be equal to the total monthly per unit utility credit for all utilities. The building owner must be able to document that households received the utility assistance as a rent credit in the appropriate amount.

 The income eligibility of households will be determined at the beginning of the pilot program, and again at the end of 12 months. The number of households found to be eligible at the beginning of the pilot program will be used to determine the amount of the utility credit voucher for the following 12 months. The amount of the utility credit voucher will be the same each month. If an income eligible household moves from a unit, the building owner will continue to receive the utility credit for that unit, based on the assumption that the owner will likely rent the unit to another income eligible household.

 The number of households found to be eligible at the end of the first 12 months of the pilot program will be used to determine the amount of the utility credit voucher from that point in time through December 31, 2000.

 The utility credit voucher will be issued in the name of the building owner and can be used only for payment of the building's utilities. The amount of the monthly utility credit voucher cannot exceed the total monthly public utility charges for the building.

 The building owner will be required to maintain documentation of household incomes and rent credits and complete a report at the end of 12 months. Program reports will include, but are not limited to, the following information:

 1) demographics of income eligible households

 2) changes in household incomes

 3) household turnover

 4) income information for households that rent units upon turnover.

 Measured Outcomes of Pilot Program

 The outcomes to be measured by the pilot program include, but at not limited to the following:

 The annual cost of such a program (programmatic and administrative costs) in sufficient detail to determine the cost/benefit of providing utility assistance in this way

 Evaluation of the utility credit voucher issued to not-for-profit corporations on behalf of income eligible households as a mechanism for providing utility rate assistance

 The net benefit of the assistance to the eligible households

 Potential administrative efficiency of using income eligibility information already collected by not-for-profit building owners to qualify households for utility rate assistance

 Whether turnover affects the number of households eligible for rate assistance

 The systems, processes, and procedures required by the HSD, SPU, SCL, and the Executive Services Department (ESD) to qualify households, calculate and issue utility credit vouchers, and utilize the vouchers as payment of a building's utility costs

 Potential demand for the program

 Reporting on Pilot Program Outcomes

 HSD, SPU, SCL, and ESD will:

 Evaluate the pilot program at the end of 12 months (est. August 2000). The program will be evaluated at the end of 12 months (est. August 2000), but continued through the end of 2000 to allow the Executive time to report to the Utilities and Environmental Management Committee on the program outcomes and to develop a recommendation related to a permanent program.

 Report to the Utilities and Environmental Management Committee on the program outcomes by October 31, 2000

 Recommend whether the program should become permanent

 If a permanent program is recommended, propose final program guidelines
