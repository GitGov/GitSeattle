 ORDINANCE __________

 AN ORDINANCE authorizing the development and implementation of a process for the non-cash transfer of computer equipment, which has become surplus to the needs of City departments, to the Seattle Public School District or not-for-profit community service agencies who will serve the City's needs; and amending Seattle Municipal Code 3.18.824 in connection therewith.

 WHEREAS, the City periodically upgrades and replaces its computer equipment, thereby making existing computer equipment available for other City purposes; and

 WHEREAS, the cash value of such equipment is typically not substantial and in many cases computers have a negative net value after considering the costs of disposition; and

 WHEREAS, the City believes there are public schools and community service agencies, both public and private, that would be able to use such computer equipment to accomplish important City purposes and provide valuable public services; and

 WHEREAS, the City believes that the Seattle Public Schools serves as an important partner in meeting our community's educational goals and would better serve those goals through the use of surplus City computer equipment; and

 WHEREAS, the City's Department Housing and Human Services and the Department of Neighborhoods have expertise and processes for identifying not-for-profit community service agencies that will reliably serve the City's needs; and

 WHEREAS, by developing a process designed to make computer equipment available to the Seattle Public Schools and community service agencies selected on the basis of specified criteria, the City can, with the expenditure of minimal resources, obtain substantial public benefits and accomplish important City purposes; NOW THEREFORE,

 BE IT ORDAINED BY THE CITY OF SEATTLE AS FOLLOWS:

 Section 1. The Executive Services Department is hereby authorized to develop and implement a program whereby computer equipment no longer needed by City departments may, after being declared surplus to the City as a whole, be made available to the Seattle School District No. 1 (the "School District") and to not-for-profit private or public community service agencies who will use that equipment to accomplish City goals. Equipment acquired with funding from restricted sources shall be disposed of only in ways permitted by the source of funding; in the case of Seattle Public Utilities and Seattle City Light, surplus computer equipment may be disposed of under this ordinance only after the utility has received from a non-utility source compensation for any true and full value that equipment may have.

 Section 2. The Executive Services Director is authorized to enter into an agreement with the School District to transfer to the School District, with or without stated consideration, from time to time, whatever surplus City computer equipment the Executive Services Director determines will support the educational mission of the School District.

 Section 3. The Department of Housing and Human Services and The Department of Neighborhoods shall adopt program guidelines and evaluation criteria to be used to select the most appropriate public and private not-for-profit community service agencies, in addition to the Seattle School District, to utilize the City's surplus computer equipment. The Director of the Department of Housing and Human Services and the Director of the Department of Neighborhoods are authorized to enter into agreements with those agencies under which the recipient commits to use that equipment in specified ways that will provide a benefit to the City at least equal to the value (if any) of the equipment.

 Section 4. The City Council declares that, to the extent the Seattle School District No. 1 benefits financially from receiving surplus City computers, the appropriations the City makes and has made to support the acquisition and maintenance of computer equipment by non-utility departments are also made to support the educational mission of the Seattle School District No. 1.

 Section 5. It is the intent of the City Council that City departments other than Seattle City Light and Seattle Public Utilities bear the costs, if any, associated with development and implementation of this program in the departments' existing budget appropriations.

 Section 6. Section 3.18.824 of the Seattle Municipal Code is amended as follows:

 3.18.824 Reports of supplies on hand -- Sale or transfer of surplus.

A. All using agencies shall submit to the Executive Services Director, at such times and in such form as he or she shall prescribe, reports showing stocks of supplies, materials and equipment on hand awaiting use. When any stock is surplus or no longer of use to any using agency, the Executive Services Director may transfer it to another or other agencies which have need for it, subject to adjustment between the agencies concerned. The Executive Services Director may sell all supplies, materials, and equipment not needed for public use or that may have become unsuitable for public use; provided, that, except for computer equipment disposed of under subsection B, any such sale shall be based on competitive bids in the same manner required for purchases unless the Executive Services Director shall determine competitive bidding to be impracticable.

B. Notwithstanding any other provision of this code, the Executive Services Director, the Director of the Department of Housing and Human Services, and the Director of the Department of Neighborhoods may dispose of surplus computer equipment in accordance with Ordinance ________ as it now exists or as it may hereafter be amended.

Section 7. Any acts consistent with and prior to the effective date of this ordinance are hereby ratified and confirmed.

 Section 8. This ordinance shall take effect and be in force thirty (30) days from and after its approval by the Mayor, but if not approved and returned by the Mayor within ten (10) days after presentation, it shall take effect as provided by Municipal Code Section 1.04.020.
