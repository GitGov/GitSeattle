 WHEREAS, the City is implementing an electronic commerce strategy, whose recent examples include the SUMMIT and Copernicus projects; and

 WHEREAS the City has entered into an Agreement for Concentration Banking and Securities Safekeeping Services with the Bank of America NT&SA as successor to Bank of America N W, N. A. d/b/a Seafirst Bank (the "Bank") pursuant to which the Bank has offered credit card services to the City; and

 WHEREAS, making purchases by credit card through the compatible technology utilized pursuant to a credit card agreement with the Bank will further the City's electronic commerce strategy; and

 WHEREAS, credit cards are expected to reduce purchasing processing costs and produce improved reporting on purchases; and

 WHEREAS, credit cards are expected to facilitate convenient and ready access to commodities which will be particularly helpful to field crews; and

 WHEREAS, the City wishes to institute a pilot program allowing departments to make small purchases by credit card; and

 WHEREAS, the Executive Services Director has recommended that the pilot program start with the Department of Parks and Recreation, Seattle City Light, and the Executive Services Department, which are geographically diverse in the location of their staffs who frequently need to procure small amounts of commodities in order to complete their assignments; and

 WHEREAS, the Executive Services Director is the appropriate person to determine after a trial period whether the program should be expanded to other City departments;

 NOW THEREFORE,

 Section 1. The Executive Services Director (the "Director") is hereby authorized to enter into a credit card agreement (the "Agreement") with the Bank of America NT&SA in substantially the form attached, with such modifications as the Director shall deem appropriate at the inception of the Agreement or from time to time, with a aggregate charge limit never to exceed Two Million Dollars ($2,000,000) principal amount outstanding and unpaid at any time. It is the intention of the City to make payments under the Agreement in full by the payment due date (presently expected to be fifteen (15) days after the billing date, but which may be adjusted by agreement between the Bank and the Director from time to time), thereby avoiding any finance charges. Section 2. The Director shall administer the City's use of credit cards and the payment of the City's obligation to the Bank, and is authorized to direct and restrict and enforce the use of credit cards by all City departments and City officers and employees. The Director may begin with a pilot program in parts or all of the Department of Parks and Recreation, Seattle City Light, and the Executive Services Department to implement the use of credit cards issued pursuant to the Agreement. A presentation on the pilot will be presented to Council no later than March 1,1999 at which time a determination, and may determine may be made concerning whether, when, and under what limitations to continue the pilot program or to expand the use of credit cards to other parts of the City.

 Section 3. The Director shall promulgate policies and procedures for the City's use of credit cards issued under the Agreement, and those policies and procedures shall, along with this ordinance, constitute the City's system for the use of credit cards under RCW 43.09.2855. At a minimum, those policies and procedures shall require that:

 A. All uses of the purchasing cards be only for purchases or acquisitions the card user would be authorized to make with City cash or a City purchase order or voucher;

 B. All expenditures be within the budgeted expenditure authority of the department or office making the purchase;

 C. No cash advances may be obtained through the credit cards;

 D. Each card must be issued bearing the individual name of a single authorized individual user, and each person shall use only the card issued in his or her individual name;

 E. The head of each department or office (the "responsible official") shall designate in writing the individuals in whose name cards shall be issued or renewed, and shall update that designation at least annually;

 F. No credit card may be valid for more than thirty-six (36) months, and the Executive Services Director may cancel or reduce the features available on any card at any time;

 G. All credit cards must be immediately returned to the City when the individual named thereon leaves City employment or changes jobs within the City, even within the same department;

 H. The responsible official shall establish the credit limit available on each card., which shall not exceed Fifteen Thousand Dollars ($15,000) per card except by approval of the Executive Services Director. which in no event shall exceed Fifteen Thousand Dollars ($15,000) per card;

 I. If a City credit card is used to hold a reservation for travel or training, make advance deposits, or pay travel or training expenses in advance, the charge shall be treated as a travel or training advance to the City employee. until the travel or training service has been provided to the City, and the advance is subject to repayment by the employee just as would be the case with a cash or check advance for travel or training; and

 J. All use of City credit cards be consistent with applicable federal, state, and City laws.

 Section 4. The use of a City credit card for other than an authorized City purpose or in a manner inconsistent with this ordinance or the policies and procedures adopted by the Director is a use of City equipment or facilities for a non-City purpose, and may constitute theft.

 Section 5. Any acts consistent with the authority and prior to the effective date of this ordinance are hereby ratified and confirmed.

 Section 6. This ordinance shall take effect and be in force thirty (30) days from and after its approval by the Mayor, but if not approved and returned by the Mayor within ten (10) days after presentation, it shall take effect as provided by Municipal Code Section 1.04.020.
