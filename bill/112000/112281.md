 Now, Therefore, the parties hereto, for and in consideration of the promises and mutual obligations herein undertaken, do hereby agree as follows:

 PART I

 Section 1. Agreement to Convey Property

 The specific details concerning all of which may be found on Sheet 2 of that certain plan entitled SR 90, Jct. SR5 to W. Shore Mercer Island Sec. 2, Bradner Place S. to W. Shore Mercer Island, now of record and on file in the Office of the Secretary of Transportation at Olympia, Washington, bearing date of approval July 6, 1979.

 which real property is hereinafter referred to as "the Property." Any portions of the Property now or hereafter constituting separate lots under the City's Land Use Code are referred to herein as "Lots."

 Section 2. Payment of Purchase Price.

 A. Base Price. Purchaser agrees to pay a purchase price of TWO HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS AND NO CENTS ($200,000.00), payable in cash or cashier's check at the time of closing, subject to increase as provided in subsection B below. Of such purchase price, the amount of $199,000 shall be paid directly by Purchaser through escrow to the State of Washington Department of Transportation to discharge the unpaid deferred purchase price of the Property under the terms of the City's purchase from the State.

 B. Price Increase in the Event of Delayed Closing. For each month or portion thereof between ___________, 1998, and the date of closing, Purchaser agrees that the purchase price shall be increased by ONE HUNDRED DOLLARS AND NO CENTS ($100.00).

 Section 3. Conveyance

 Upon the payment of the sum provided in Section 2 and all other amounts required to be paid by Purchaser hereunder, and upon the satisfaction of the conditions set forth in Section 5 below, the City shall convey title to the Property by Special Warranty Deed in the form attached hereto as Attachment B (the "Deed"), which is hereby approved as to form by Purchaser.

 Section 4. Title Insurance

 The City shall provide the Purchaser with an owner's policy of title insurance in standard form, at Purchaser's expense. A preliminary title commitment has been provided for the Purchaser's inspection and Purchaser has reviewed the preliminary title report. In the event such examination disclosed any liens, encumbrances or defects (collectively "exceptions") not acceptable to Purchaser, other than nondelinquent taxes and assessments, all such items not acceptable to the Purchaser are set forth on Attachment E to this Agreement and the City shall have a reasonable time after the date hereof in which to remove the exception(s), but in no event more than ninety (90) days from the date hereof. If no exceptions are identified on Attachment E, then Purchaser agrees to accept title subject to all exceptions shown in the preliminary title report. In the event that the City is unable to remove such exceptions or to convey good and marketable title to the Property this Agreement shall be terminated without liability of the City, and the Good Faith Deposit shall be returned to Purchaser, unless Purchaser elects to waive Purchaser's objections to such exceptions. If Purchaser, after receipt of notice from the City that one or more exceptions to title objected to by Purchaser will not be cleared, gives written notice to the City that Purchaser will not accept title subject to such exceptions, then this Agreement shall be terminated, the Good Faith Deposit shall be returned to Purchaser, and neither party shall have any further obligations hereunder except for any indemnity obligations of Purchaser under Section 202A hereof. If Purchaser does not give written notice to the City, within fifteen (15) days after notice from the City to Purchaser that the City will not clear title of any exceptions objected to by Purchaser, that Purchaser elects to accept title subject to such exceptions, then at any time thereafter the City may return the Good Faith Deposit and terminate this Agreement without any further obligation on either party.

 Section 5. Conditions Precedent

 The following shall be conditions precedent to the City's obligation to convey the Property:

 (a) Purchaser shall have inspected the Property and executed the Disclaimer of Warranties and Release attached hereto as Attachment D ("Disclaimer").

 (b) Purchaser shall have deposited with Pacific Northwest Title Company of Washington, Inc. (the "Escrow Agent") for disbursement in accordance with this Contract the sum of money required to pay the purchase price stated under Section 2 of this Agreement and all other amounts payable by Purchaser hereunder, in cash or cashier's check.

 (c) Purchaser shall otherwise be in compliance with all of the terms hereof.

 Section 6. Good Faith Deposit

 Purchaser shall deposit with the City a good faith deposit in the amount of TEN THOUSAND DOLLARS AND NO CENTS ($10,000.00) (the "Good Faith Deposit") immediately upon execution of this Agreement. This Good Faith Deposit shall be held in the City Finance Department's Clearing Account until such time as the Purchaser becomes entitled to return of such deposit under the terms hereof, or until the City becomes entitled to retain such deposit under the provisions of this agreement. The Good Faith Deposit shall serve as earnest money to secure Purchaser's obligation to close the purchase of the Property and, after Closing, shall secure Purchaser's obligations to submit plans, obtain financing and complete the Improvements in a timely manner and in accordance with this Agreement. At the Purchaser's option a performance bond in an amount of $10,000.00, in form satisfactory to the City, conditioned to be paid to the City in full if a Certificate of Completion covering the entire Property is not issued prior to October 1, 2000, may be submitted in lieu of the Good Faith Deposit at the time the Deed is recorded. In the event the Purchaser exercises this option the Good Faith Deposit may be credited to the purchase price. Purchaser shall not be entitled to interest on the Good Faith Deposit.

 Section 7. Closing

 A. Closing shall take place on such date as the Purchaser shall specify by notice to the City at least ten (10) days in advance of the closing date, which notice may be given at any time within thirty (30) days after all conditions herein, other than deposit of funds and instructions in escrow, have been satisfied, provided that closing shall occur no later than October 1, 1999. "Closing" shall mean the execution, delivery and recording (as appropriate) of all documents and payment of all funds into escrow as provided herein.

 B. At Closing, the Escrow Agent shall be instructed to record the Deed and to instruct in turn the King County Office of Records and Elections (County Recorder) to mail the original of the Deed following recording, to the Purchaser as grantee. The escrow fee charged in connection with this closing shall be paid by Purchaser. Any taxes, assessments or public charges that are payable with respect to the Property during the City's ownership thereof shall be prorated as of Closing; the City's allocable share thereof shall be paid from funds deposited in escrow by Purchaser and credited against the purchase price. Purchaser shall pay the cost of recording the Deed and any documents required by Purchaser's financing. Each party shall sign and deliver such escrow instructions and other documents as are reasonably necessary to effect Closing as contemplated herein.

 C. If the sale fails to close due to fault of one of the parties, as described in Sections 702 and 703 of Part II of this agreement, then such party shall be solely responsible for all escrow and title insurance cancellation charges. If the sale fails to close by the date set forth in subsection A. above for reasons other than those set forth in Sections 702 or 703, then the Good Faith Deposit shall be returned to Purchaser less one half of any escrow or title insurance cancellation charges and the City shall pay such charges one-half from the Good Faith Deposit and one-half from the City's own funds; provided that if the sale does not close due to the City's failure to clear defects in title objected to by Purchaser as permitted by Section 4 hereof, the City shall return the full Good Faith Deposit and pay all cancellation charges from its own funds.

 PART II

 DEVELOPMENT OF PROPERTY

 Section 101. Intent to Develop; Purpose of Development.

 Purchaser represents and agrees that the purchase of the Property is for the purpose of immediate development of dwellings, the majority of which are intended for sale to first-time home buyers, as defined in the City of Seattle 1995 Housing Levy Administrative and Financial Plan adopted by Ordinance 119168, with incomes at or below the Section 8 low-income limits for the Seattle-Everett-Bellevue PMSA, adjusted for family size, as published by the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development ("HUD") and not for speculation in land holding. The parties acknowledge that Purchaser's covenants to construct Improvements in accordance with the terms and conditions contained herein are material to the City's agreement to convey the Parcel.

 Section 102. Improvements.

 Purchaser agrees to develop the Property with at least eleven (11) dwelling units, as generally set forth in Attachment C to this Agreement, which is incorporated herein by this reference. The improvements to be constructed on the Property as generally described in Attachment C, which shall be more specifically described in the plans to be submitted by Purchaser hereunder, are referred to as the "Improvements".

 Section 103. Development Agreement

 Promptly upon the execution hereof, Purchaser shall enter into a development agreement for the development of the Improvements ("Development Agreement") with _________________________ ("Developer"). The form of Developer Agreement shall be subject to prior review and approval by the Director. All time periods and deadlines in the Development Agreement shall be consistent with the terms hereof. The Development Agreement shall remain in full force and effect, and there shall be no substitution for the Developer or for any principal members of the original development team without the express written consent of the City. Purchaser shall provide to City promptly upon the execution thereof a copy of the Development Agreement and any amendment or modification to the Development Agreement. No deviation from the form of Development Agreement approved by the Director, nor any amendment to any Development Agreement, that could reasonably impair the ability of the Purchaser to satisfy the conditions hereof or to comply with the terms hereof shall be entered into without the express written consent of the City.

 Section 104. Timing of Improvements

 Purchaser agrees that the Improvements to be constructed in accordance with this Agreement shall be completed no later than two (2) years from the date of execution hereof.

 ACCEPTANCE, CONDITION AND POSSESSION OF PROPERTY

 Section 201. Acceptance AS IS

 Purchaser agrees to accept the Property AS IS with NO WARRANTIES OR REPRESENTATIONS OF ANY KIND by the City or its employees or agents, except as may be set forth specifically in this Agreement.

 Section 202. Environmental Matters

 A. Purchaser shall have the right to commission its own environmental investigation of the Property, and Purchaser's own engineering and other studies, all at Purchaser's sole risk and expense. No excavations or other activities that require a permit under applicable City Codes or regulations shall be conducted unless Purchaser obtains such a permit at its sole expense and complies with all conditions thereof. Purchaser agrees that the City and its officers, employees and agents shall not be liable to Purchaser for any injury to persons or property on or about the Property in connection with activities pursuant to this subsection, whether or not due to any condition of the Property or due to any negligence of the City or its officers, employees or agents. Unless otherwise expressly authorized by DHHS, Purchaser shall promptly restore the Property to the condition it was in prior to any activities undertaken pursuant to this subsection. Purchaser shall defend, indemnify and hold harmless the City from any liability, loss, or damage (including costs and attorneys' fees) resulting from the acts or omissions of Purchaser or its contractors or agents in connection with any such inspection, investigation, studies or related activities on or about the Property. Any contract entered into by Purchaser for any consultants' services shall expressly provide that the City shall have no obligation thereunder and that the charges for such services shall not be a lien on the Property unless and until Purchaser shall have completed the purchase thereof from the City. If Purchaser does commission any investigations or studies then Purchaser shall provide copies of any reports generated thereby to the City.

 B. The Director has not received notification of any kind from any agency (including without limitation any other City Department or agency) suggesting that the Property is or may be targeted for a federal or state Superfund cleanup. The Director is aware of a release of hazardous materials presumed to have originated from property at 1366 31st Avenue South, which release is presumed to be the source of contamination of groundwater detected on the site adjoining the Property to the east. The Director has provided Purchaser with all information obtained by the Department of Housing and Human Services with respect to such release. Purchaser acknowledges that it has received and reviewed the following documents:

 Dames & Moore. Final Report: Phase I Environmental Site Assessment, Bradner Apartment Complex, 1366 31st Avenue South, Seattle, Washington. Prepared for Washington Department of Transportation, June 9, 1993.

 Dames & Moore. Final Report: Preliminary Soil and Groundwater Characterization, Bradner Place Apartment Complex. Prepared for Washington Department of Transportation, February 10, 1994.

 GeoScience Management, Inc. Supplemental Investigation Report: Texaco Location #63-802-1030, 1366 31st Avenue South, Seattle, WA. Prepared for Texaco Refining and Marketing Inc., July 25, 1996.

 Condon, Michael W., "Annual Groundwater Monitoring Report, 1996: 1366 31st Avenue South, Seattle, WA, Former Texaco Facility #63-802-1030. " Texaco Refining and Marketing Inc., March 27, 1997.

 The City does not represent or warrant the completeness or accuracy of the information in such documents. Except for the release presumed to have originated on the property at 1366 31st Avenue South, the Director is not aware of actual or potential contamination of the Property with any hazardous waste or materials, and has no actual knowledge of a release or threatened release of any hazardous waste or materials on the Property.

 Section 203. Termination Following Inspection

 In the event inspection by Purchaser or Purchaser's agent(s) discloses after the date hereof any physical condition that would materially impair the development thereof as contemplated hereunder, or would substantially increase the cost of such development, Purchaser shall have the option, as Purchaser's sole recourse, to terminate this Agreement by written notice to the City at any time prior to Closing. Together with notice of termination, Purchaser shall provide the City with a copy of any reports or findings that disclose such physical condition or conditions. If the City concurs that the physical condition disclosed would in fact materially impair the development of the Property substantially as contemplated hereunder, or would substantially increase the cost of such development, the City shall refund the Good Faith Deposit in full, and neither party shall have any further obligation to the other (except for Purchaser's obligation to indemnify the City under Section 202A above). Purchaser's execution of the Disclaimer attached hereto as Attachment D shall constitute Purchaser's waiver of any right to terminate under this Section and acceptance of the Property in AS IS condition.

 Section 204. Changes in Condition

 If Purchaser or DHHS becomes aware of any change in the physical condition of the Property after the date hereof that would materially impair the development thereof as contemplated hereunder, or would substantially increase the cost of such development, such party shall promptly notify the other party of such change. If any such change is caused by the acts of Purchaser or its agents, employees or contractors the Purchaser shall restore the Property to its prior condition. If Purchaser is not responsible under the preceding sentence then (1) if the City gives notice to Purchaser within ten (10) days after receiving notice of such change in condition that the City elects to remedy such changed condition, then this Agreement shall remain in effect and the City shall remedy such changed condition prior to closing, and (2) if the City does not give notice of such election, then Purchaser shall have the option, by notice to the City no later than twenty (20) days after giving notice to the City of, or receiving notice of, such changed condition (as the case may be), to cancel this Agreement and receive a full refund of the Good Faith Deposit, in which case neither party shall have any further obligation or liability to the other hereunder (except for any liability of Purchaser under Section 202 A.). Any notice from Purchaser to City hereunder that Purchaser is prepared to close the purchase shall constitute Purchaser's representation that it has reinspected the Property and agrees to accept it in its condition on the date of such notice, under all of the terms set forth on Attachment D, whether or not such condition has changed from the date hereof.

 Section 205. Condemnation

 In the event any portion of the Property shall be taken, damaged or condemned for public or quasi-public use, except as stated in the following sentence, all compensation awarded upon such condemnation, damaging or taking up to the amount of the unpaid purchase price shall be retained by the City and applied to the purchase price, and any balance shall inure to Purchaser and the City shall have no claim thereto. In the event of taking, damage or condemnation by a public or quasi-public body of a portion of the Property making it infeasible for Purchaser to complete the development of the Improvements, Purchaser shall have the right to terminate this Agreement by written notice to the City within ten (10) days after the effective date of such taking, damage or condemnation, and if closing has not yet occurred then all compensation shall be retained by the City and the Good Faith Deposit shall be refunded.

 Section 206. Possession

 Purchaser shall be entitled to exclusive possession of the Property (subject to the rights of the City contained herein) upon recording of the Deed.

 PLANS, APPROVALS, FINANCING AND CONSTRUCTION

 Section 301. Design and Schematic Plans

 Prior to application for a Master Use Permit for development of the Property, and no later than six months following the execution of this Agreement, the Purchaser shall submit to City schematic designs and plans (herein "Schematic Plans") in sufficient detail with respect to development of the entire Property to clearly describe the site plan, architectural character, circulation, landscaping features and relationship to the surrounding environment of the Improvements.

 The Schematic Plans shall be in conformity with Section 101 of this Agreement and all applicable state and local laws and regulations, and shall be consistent with the design guidelines contained in the Request for Qualifications issued by Purchaser dated March 1, 1993 (the "RFQ").

 The Schematic Plans shall be subject to review and approval by the Director as to conformity with this Agreement. The Director shall complete the Schematic Plans review within fifteen (15) working days of receipt of the Schematic Plans. If within such period, the City gives notice to Purchaser of changes reasonably required by the City, the Purchaser shall submit revised Schematic Plans reflecting such changes within thirty (30) days after receipt of such notice. If the City does not give notice of any required changes within such period, and if the transmittal of such plans contained conspicuous notice on the first page thereof of the time limit for review hereunder, then the plans shall be deemed approved for purposes hereof unless they are manifestly inconsistent in material respects with Attachment C or the Design Guidelines in the RFQ.

 With the consent of the Director or her designee, the Purchaser may elect to proceed directly to prepare and submit Construction Plans in lieu of Schematic Plans, provided that the Construction Plans shall contain all information required for Schematic Plans and shall be subject to review and revision as provided in this Section, which requirements and reviews shall be in addition to those provided in Section 302. As a condition of the Director's consent, Purchaser may be required to consent to a period for review of plans and notification of required changes longer than otherwise provided herein.

 Section 302. Construction Plans and Specifications

 Purchaser shall prepare plans and specifications with respect to the construction of Improvements ("Construction Plans") in conformity with the previously approved Schematic Plans, this Agreement and all applicable state and local laws and regulations. The Construction Plans shall be in sufficient completeness and detail not only to satisfy requirements pertinent to application for a building permit but also to demonstrate to the Director that the improvements and their construction will be in accordance with the previously approved Schematic Plans. Purchaser shall submit the Construction Plans, together with construction or progress schedule, to the Director, prior to the submission of the Construction Plans to the Department of Construction and Land Use ("DCLU").

 Purchaser shall submit Construction Plans to the Director at any time following the City's approval of Schematic Plans and in any event within twelve months following execution of this Agreement. If the City does not give notice of any required changes in Construction Plans within fifteen (15) working days of receipt thereof, and if the transmittal of such plans contained conspicuous notice on the first page thereof of the time limit for review hereunder, then the plans shall be deemed approved for purposes hereof unless they are manifestly inconsistent in material respects with the Schematic Plans. Final approval of the Construction Plans will be subject to acceptance by DCLU as evidenced by the issuance of the necessary permits for development and construction of the Improvements.

 Section 303. Changes in Construction Plans or Schematic Plans

 If Purchaser desires to make any material changes in the size, character, design, or exterior surface of structures or in the site plan, exterior elevation or materials or any of them as set forth in the Construction Plans and Schematic Plans or either of them after approval by the City, the Purchaser shall submit the proposed change to the Director for her approval. If the Director finds that the Construction Plans and/or Schematic Plans as modified by the proposed change conform to the requirements of Section 301 and 302 hereof, the Director shall approve the proposed change evidencing such approval by her endorsement of the same on the revised plan sheets and by notifying the Purchaser and the DCLU Director in writing of her approval. Such changes in the Construction Plans and Schematic Plans or either of them shall in any event be approved or rejected in whole or in part, by written notice from the City to the Purchaser within ten (10) working days of submittal by the Purchaser. If the City does not give notice of any required changes in Schematic Plans or Construction Plans within ten (10) working days of receipt thereof, and if the transmittal of such plans contained conspicuous notice on the first page thereof of the time limit for review hereunder, then the plans shall be deemed approved for purposes hereof unless they are manifestly inconsistent in material respects with the requirements for such plans hereunder.

 Section 304. Evidence of Financing

 Purchaser represents that Purchaser has in effect an agreement with U.S. Bank of Washington ("Bank") for financing the acquisition and construction of housing of the type contemplated by this Agreement, under which the Bank will issue financing commitments for individual parcels upon completion of an underwriting process. Purchaser shall, within 60 days after the date hereof, apply to Bank for the financing commitment on the Property, and shall diligently seek to obtain that commitment in an amount necessary to fund the construction contemplated hereby. If Purchaser fails to obtain and provide to the City a firm financing commitment in such amount within one year of the date of execution of this Agreement, then Purchaser shall be in default and the City shall have the remedies specified in Section 704 below. If the City does not give notice to Purchaser within fifteen (15) days after receipt of a copy of the financing commitment that any terms thereof are not acceptable to City, then City shall be deemed to have approved the terms thereof except to the extent that any such terms are contrary to the provisions hereof.

 Section 305. Report on Progress

 Subsequent to the conveyance of the Property to the Purchaser and until construction of the Improvements is complete, the Purchaser shall, within ten (10) days of any request by the City, forward to the Director a report in writing as to the actual progress of the required drawings, financial commitment or construction.

 Section 306. Purpose of Review of Plans and Inspection of Work

 Review by DHHS of plans and specifications and inspection by DHHS of construction improvements is for the sole purpose of evaluating compliance with the terms of this Agreement. Such inspection shall not be construed as a representation or warranty to Purchaser or any third party that the plans and specifications are adequate for any purpose, that there has been or will be compliance on the part of any contractor or subcontractor with the plans and specifications, that construction has been or will be free from faulty material or workmanship, or as to any other matter. Purchaser shall cause this Section 306 to be included in any contract for work into which Purchaser shall enter under this Agreement.

 Section 307. Certificate of Completion of Improvements

 Promptly after completion of the Improvements on any Lot in accordance with the provisions of this Agreement and the approved Construction Plans, as confirmed by inspection by DHHS, the Director shall furnish the Purchaser with a certificate of completion ("Certificate" herein) substantially in the form attached hereto as Attachment A, for the Lot or Lots of the Property upon which the Improvements have been properly completed. A Certificate shall be issued when the Purchaser has completed the Improvements on such Lot pursuant to the Construction Plans and has cured any deficiencies noted by the City in its inspections. Delivery of the Certificate by the Director and recording thereof by the Purchaser shall be conclusive evidence of satisfaction of obligations of the Purchaser to construct the Improvements on the Lot or Lots covered by such Certificate and of the termination of the condition subsequent in the Deed as to such Lot or Lots. Upon delivery of the Certificate of Completion for the entire Property, unless the City has already exercised its right to retain the Deposit for a breach or default on the part of Purchaser, the Deposit shall be returned to Purchaser.

 If the Director shall refuse or fail to provide a Certificate in accordance with the provisions of this Section 307, the Director shall, within seven (7) days after written request by the Purchaser made prior to the last date for completion of the Improvements hereunder, provide the Purchaser with a written statement indicating in adequate detail in what respects the Purchaser has failed to complete the Improvements in accordance with the provisions of this Agreement, or is otherwise in default, and what measures or acts will be necessary, in the opinion of the Director, for the Purchaser to take or to cause to be taken to obtain such Certificate. When such acts or measures have been completed and the City has reinspected the Property to confirm such completion the Certificate shall be issued.

 SPECIAL CONDITIONS

 Section 401. Nondiscrimination and Affirmative Efforts in Contracting

 [Language to be inserted following clarification of impact of Initiative 200.]

 Section 402. Affordability of Improvements; Sale of Homes to Low- Income Buyers

 A. Intent. It is the Purchaser's intent to develop the Property with a mixture of market-rate homes and homes for purchase by low- income buyers (as defined below) who are first-time home buyers ("low- income, first-time buyers") at prices affordable to such buyers, as further described in subsection B below. (See Section 101 for applicable definition of "first-time home buyer.") The parties recognize that it may be necessary to price the homes for sale to low- income, first-time buyers below Purchaser's costs of developing such homes in order assure affordability to low-income buyers.

 B. Homes for Low-Income Buyers. Purchaser shall make every effort to assure that at least six homes on the Property are affordable for purchase by low-income buyers, defined as households with incomes at or below Section 8 low-income limits for the Seattle-Bellevue-Everett PMSA, adjusted for family size, as published by HUD; such efforts to include, without limitation, using any available proceeds from any homes on the Property that are sold for more than the Purchasers' development costs to offset below-cost sales to low-income buyers. In determining the affordability of homes for purchase by low-income buyers, Purchaser may take into consideration the availability of programs offering special loan terms, down payment assistance, etc. to such buyers. Methods and assumptions for determining affordability shall be as follows unless specifically modified with the consent of the Director in consideration of the features and terms of such programs:

 (1) Income adjustments for family size shall be based upon a presumed family size of 1.5 persons for each bedroom in a home, rounded down to the next lowest integer in case such presumed family size is not an integer.

 (2) Monthly payments for mortgage principal, interest, taxes, and insurance (including mortgage insurance, if applicable) may not exceed 30% of the gross monthly income of a presumed family at the Section 8 low-income limit, assuming a 30-year, fixed-rate mortgage and a cash downpayment from the buyer's resources no greater than ten percent (10%) of the sale price.

 (3) Purchaser shall clearly specify all assumptions used in determining an affordable price, including interest rates, allowance for taxes, insurance, and mortgage insurance, and the amount of any other applicable fees and charges.

 Provided that qualified low-income buyers are able to obtain gap financing in the form of grants or deferred-payment loans in amounts up to $25,000 per buyer, Purchaser represents and agrees that a minimum of six (6) homes on the Property will be sold to low-income, first-time buyers.

 D. Reporting. Purchaser shall report to the Director or her designee the addresses of homes offered for sale to low-income, first- time buyers and the prices of such homes; information with respect to the household size and income of each low-income, first-time buyer who has executed a purchase and sale agreement to purchase a home on the Property; and confirmation following closing of purchase and occupancy of homes purchased by low-income, first-time buyers. Purchaser's files with respect to the costs of developing the Property, sales prices of homes developed thereon, and the qualifications of low- income, first-time buyers shall be made available for inspection by the Director or designee upon the request of the Director.

 PROHIBITIONS AGAINST ASSIGNMENT AND TRANSFER

 Section 501. Prohibition Against Transfer of Property and Assignment of Agreement.

 Purchaser represents and agrees that:

 A. Purchaser has not made or created or suffered to be made or created any assignment, conveyance, mortgage, lease, trust, power or transfer, of any sort, of this agreement or any interest herein, or any interest in or relating to the Property, or entered into any agreement or contract to do any of the foregoing and (except as authorized by Sections 601-605 herein) Purchaser shall not do any of the foregoing prior to issuance of a Certificate of Completion of the Improvements without the prior written approval of the City, which may be withheld in the City's sole discretion.

 B. In order to request City approval for any transaction of the type referenced in Subsection A above, Purchaser shall submit to the City all documents relating to the proposed transactions and such information concerning the proposed transferee as the City shall request. If the City approves the transaction, as a condition of such approval, the transferee shall assume all obligations of Purchaser hereunder and shall agree to comply with such other conditions the City may find desirable in order to achieve and safeguard the purposes of this Agreement. This Subsection B shall not apply to mortgages or deeds of trust granted to a financial institution approved by the City as authorized in Section 601 below.

 C. In the absence of specific written agreement by the City to the contrary, no transfer or approval thereof by the City shall be deemed to relieve Purchaser, or any other party bound in any way by this Agreement or otherwise with respect to the construction of the Improvements, from any of its obligations with respect thereto.

 MORTGAGE FINANCING; RIGHTS OF MORTGAGEES

 Section 601. Limitation Upon Encumbrance of Property

 Prior to the issuance of a Certificate of Completion for the Improvements, the Purchaser shall not engage in any financing or any other transaction creating any mortgage or other encumbrance or lien upon the Property without the express written consent of the City. The Purchaser shall notify the City in advance of any financing secured by mortgage or other similar lien instrument, that Purchaser proposes to enter into with respect to the Property, or any part thereof, and in any event Purchaser shall promptly notify the City of any encumbrance or lien that has been created on or attached to the Property, whether by voluntary act of the Purchaser or otherwise. If the terms of the proposed mortgage financing are reasonably satisfactory to the City, the City shall, at or after Closing hereunder, join in the execution of the mortgage or deed of trust for the sole purpose of subordinating the City's possibility of reverter (as described below) to the lien of such instrument, but with any liability of the City or its officers expressly disclaimed.

 Section 602. Mortgagee Not Obligated to Construct

 Notwithstanding any of the provisions of this Agreement, the holder of any mortgage authorized by this Agreement (including any such holder who obtains title to the Property or any part thereof as a result of foreclosure proceedings, or action in lieu thereof) shall in no case be obligated by the provisions of this Agreement to construct or complete the Improvements or to guarantee such construction or completion; nor shall any covenant or any other provision in the Deed be construed to so obligate such holder; provided, that nothing in this Section or any other Section or provision of this Agreement shall be deemed or construed to permit or authorize any such holder to devote the Property or any part thereof to any uses, or to construct any improvements thereon, other than those uses or improvements provided or permitted in the I-90 Area Development Policies adopted by Seattle City Council Resolution 27901.

 Section 603. Copy of Notice of Default to Mortgagee

 Whenever the City shall deliver any notice or demand to the Purchaser with respect to any breach or default by the Purchaser in its obligations or covenants under the Agreement, the City shall at the same time forward a copy of such notice or demand to each holder of any mortgage authorized by the Agreement which holder has been identified to the City in writing by Purchaser, at the last address of such holder shown in the records of the City.

 Section 604. Mortgagee's Option To Cure Defaults

 After any breach or default referred to in Section 603 hereof, each such holder shall (insofar as the rights of the City are concerned) have the right, at its option, to cure or remedy such breach or default and to add the reasonable cost thereof to the mortgage debt and the lien of its mortgage: Provided, that if the breach or default is with respect to construction of the Improvements, nothing contained in the Agreement shall be deemed to permit or authorize such holder to undertake or continue the construction or completion of improvements on the Property (beyond the extent necessary to conserve or protect Improvements or construction already made) except for completion of the Improvements substantially as provided pursuant to this Agreement. In the case of any breach or default occurring after Purchaser shall have acquired the Property and shall have granted a mortgage or deed of trust in favor of a construction lender, such lender shall have an additional 30 days to cure such breach or default after the expiration of any cure period allowed to Purchaser, and if the breach or default cannot reasonably be cured within such 30-day period then the additional period of cure allowed to the lender shall be extended for such time as is reasonably required to cure such breach or default, provided that the lender shall give notice of its intent to cure and commence cure within such 30-day period and continue diligently to pursue such cure.

 Section 605. Mortgage and Holder

 For the purposes of the Agreement: The term "mortgage" shall include a deed of trust or other instrument creating an encumbrance or lien upon the Property, or any part thereof, as security for a loan. The term "holder" in reference to a mortgage shall include any insurer or guarantor of any obligation or condition secured by such mortgage or deed of trust.

 DEFAULT AND REMEDIES

 Section 701. In General

 Except as otherwise provided in this Agreement, in the event of any default in or breach of this Agreement, or any of its terms or conditions, by any party hereto, or any successor to a party, such party (or successor) shall, upon written notice from the other, proceed immediately to cure or remedy such default or breach, and, in any event, shall complete such cure within sixty (60) days after receipt of such notice or such shorter period as may be provided herein. In case such action is not taken or not diligently pursued, or the default or breach shall not be cured or remedied within the time permitted hereunder, the aggrieved party may pursue any remedies available at law or in equity, subject to the specific limitations herein.

 Section 702. Termination By Fault of City Prior to Conveyance of Property

 In the event that any of the following occurs prior to conveyance of the Property:

 A. The City fails to tender conveyance of the Property in the manner required herein after satisfaction of the conditions provided in this Agreement and notice to close from Purchaser as specified herein, and any such failure shall not be cured within sixty (60) days after notice from the Purchaser; or

 B. The City otherwise fails or refuses to carry out the terms and conditions of this Agreement prior to Closing;

 then at the option of Purchaser this Agreement shall be terminated by written notice thereof to the City, Purchaser shall receive a full refund of the Good Faith Deposit Purchaser shall have the right, as its sole remedy, to proceed against the City for actual damages limited to an additional amount equal to the Good Faith Deposit.

 Section 703. Termination by Fault of Purchaser Prior to Conveyance of Property

 In the event that prior to the conveyance of the Property to Purchaser:

 A. Purchaser (or any successor in interest) assigns or attempts to assign this Agreement or any rights therein or in the Property without the express consent of the City; or

 B. Purchaser, without legal excuse, gives notice that it will be unable or unwilling to close the Purchase as provided herein; or

 C. Purchaser, without legal excuse, does not tender the full consideration for and take title to the Property, and perform all other obligations of Purchaser at Closing upon tender of conveyance by the City pursuant to this Agreement; or

 D. Purchaser, without legal excuse, fails to give written notice of intent to close pursuant to Section 7.A of Part I hereof at least ten (10) days in advance of the last date for closing specified in such Section, notwithstanding the satisfaction of all conditions to Purchaser's obligation to close except those to be satisfied at Closing; or

 E. Purchaser, without legal excuse, otherwise fails to comply in a timely manner with the terms of this Agreement prior to Closing; or

 F. Purchaser shall fail to close on another parcel of property under another Contract for Sale of Land with the City within the period specified in such Contract, without reasonable cause or without written notice to the City reasonably in advance of the expiration of such period; or there shall be multiple failures by Purchaser to comply in material respects with the terms or conditions of the land sale contracts with the City, if such failures are not promptly corrected to the satisfaction of the City;

 then at the option of the City this Agreement and any rights of Purchaser or of any assignee or transferee in this Agreement or arising therefrom with respect to the City or the Property shall be terminated, and unless the sole ground for termination is item F. above, the Good Faith Deposit shall be retained by the City as liquidated damages, as the sole and exclusive remedy available to the City, and neither Purchaser (or assignee or transferee) nor the City shall have any further rights against or liability to the other under this Agreement except for any indemnity obligations of Purchaser under Section 202A hereof. If the sole ground for termination is item F. above then the Good Faith Deposit under this Agreement shall be returned to Purchaser and neither Purchaser (or assignee or transferee) nor the City shall have any further rights against or liability to the other under this Agreement, provided that any obligation of Purchaser under Section 202A hereof shall survive.

 Section 704. Reversion of Title to City Upon Failure to Submit Plans, Obtain Financing, Complete Improvements or Upon Certain Other Events Subsequent to Conveyance to Purchaser

 A. The City is selling the Property for the purpose of construction of housing needed by City residents and in reliance on the covenant of Purchaser that such housing will be constructed. Therefore, as set forth in the Deed, the conveyance of the Property to Purchaser shall be subject to a condition subsequent to the effect that in the event of failure to complete the Improvements in a timely manner, or failure timely to perform any obligation under Section 301, 302, 303 or 304, or upon the occurrence of other events described in the Deed prior to completion of the Improvements, and after failure on the part of Purchaser to cure or remedy such failure or other event within the period (if any) and in the manner stated in the Deed, the City at its option may declare a termination of all the rights and interests in and to the Property conveyed by the Deed to Purchaser, and that such title and interests to and in the Property shall vest in the City, upon which all rights of Purchaser (and all persons claiming through Purchaser) in and to the Property and possession thereof shall cease;

 Provided, that such condition subsequent and any reverting of title as a result thereof in the City (1) shall always be subordinate to and limited by, and shall not defeat, render invalid, or limit in any way, (i) the lien of any mortgage authorized by the City pursuant to this Agreement, and (ii) any rights or interests provided in this Agreement for the protection of the holders of such mortgages; and (2) shall not apply to the Property once the Improvements to be constructed have been completed in accordance with this Agreement and the Certificate has been issued as provided in Section 307 hereof; and

 Further Provided, that the City may not exercise its right of termination with respect to any Lot for which a partial Certificate of Completion has been issued, and any revesting of title in the City shall specifically except any such Lot or Lots.

 B. If the City exercises its right to revest title to the City pursuant to this section, the City shall return to Purchaser, without interest, all funds paid by Purchaser to the City for the Property, after deducting (1) that portion of the purchase price attributable to any Lot as to which the City's power of termination is not being exercised; (2) any amounts used to pay off liens incurred or permitted by Purchaser; (3) City expenses related to this transaction, including expenses, if any, of restoring the Property to safe and marketable condition; and (4) any amount by which the appraised value of the Property (or the portion thereof revested in the City) at the time of revesting in the City is exceeded by the price paid by Purchaser (or portion thereof allocable to the portion of the Property revested in the City, determined as stated below).

 The portion of the purchase price for the Property attributable to any Lot for purposes of this Section shall be determined by dividing the area of the Lot by the area of the entire Property, unless the parties shall agree to another method.

 C. In addition to, and not in the alternative to, the City's power of termination as provided for above, the City shall have the right, at any time when the City would have the right to declare a termination of Purchaser's interest under the terms of the Deed, by notice to Purchaser and Escrow Agent, to elect to retain the Good Faith Deposit, or obtain payment on any bond provided in lieu thereof, in either case without any deduction, offset or recoupment whatsoever, as liquidated damages in the event of default, violation or failure of the Purchaser as specified in this section. If the City makes such election to retain the Deposit or realize on the bond, then Purchaser shall have an additional ninety (90) days beyond the deadline otherwise applicable to remedy the failure or event giving rise to the City's right to terminate Purchaser's interest, prior to effectiveness of any termination.

 Section 705. Other Rights and Remedies; No Waiver of Delay

 Either party shall have the right to institute such actions or proceedings as it may deem desirable for effectuating its remedies. Any delay by either party in instituting or prosecuting any such actions or proceedings or otherwise asserting its rights under this Agreement shall not operate as a waiver of any rights or remedies or to deprive it of or limit such rights or remedies in any way; nor shall any waiver in fact made with respect to any specific default be considered or treated as a waiver of the rights or remedies of either party with respect to any other defaults or with respect to the particular default except to the extent specifically waived in writing.
