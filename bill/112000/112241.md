 AN ORDINANCE amending Exhibit A attached to Ordinance 118297 for the sale to Nikkei Concerns of Parcel 8A-9 in the Yesler-Atlantic Neighborhood Improvement Project (Wash. R-5) area.

 WHEREAS, on September 30, 1996, by Ordinance 118297, the City Council accepted the redevelopment proposal of Nikkei Concerns to purchase and develop Parcel 8A-9 in the Yesler-Atlantic Neighborhood Improvement Project (Wash. R-5) area in a manner described in Exhibit A to Ordinance 118297; and

 WHEREAS, Exhibit A (Report and Recommendation to Accept Redevelopment Proposals for Yesler-Atlantic Parcels 8A-9, 40A, 60 and 71) to Ordinance 118297 describes the development of twenty- two units of housing in a mixed configuration of six one-bedroom units, twelve two-bedroom units and four three-bedroom units with half of the units sold as condominiums and half retained as rental units; and

 WHEREAS, The City of Seattle Office of Housing recommended that Nikkei Concerns verify financing potential and marketability of the product mix through market research prior to signing a Contract For Sale of Land; and
