 CONTRACT BETWEEN THE CITY OF SEATTLE AND PEND OREILLE COUNTY

 This contract made and entered into this _____ day of __________, 1999, by and between the City of Seattle (hereinafter the "City"), and Pend Oreille County (hereinafter the "County").

 WITNESS TO:

 WHEREAS, the City operates a hydroelectric generating facility (hereinafter the "Boundary Project") in Pend Oreille County and said facility was constructed after March 17, 1955, and

 WHEREAS, the parties executed this contract providing for certain payments to the County based on the loss of revenue and increased cost to the County, the Selkirk, Cusick, and Newport School Districts ("School Districts") and the towns of Metaline, Metaline Falls, and Ione ("Towns") due to the City's operation of the Boundary Project, all pursuant to RCW 35.21.425, .426, and .427, and

 NOW, THEREFORE, for and in consideration of the covenants contained herein, the parties agree as follows:

 1. That this contract becomes effective on January 1, 1999, and sets forth the method for determining the amount of each payment for the years 1999 through 2008.

 2. It is hereby agreed that the annual payments contemplated by this contract shall be made on or before December 31 of each designated year in accordance with the following:

 (a) The City and County mutually accept the compensation methodology prescribed by state law for taxation of the generation facilities of public utility districts as the basis for the City's impact compensation of the County for the term of this Contract.

 (b) In 1999, the City will pay the County $934,863. This base impact compensation payment will be increased by an inflation factor of 3.1% each year, and the resulting amount likewise increased from year to year. Provided however, that if the Puget Sound Consumer Price Index rises or falls one full point or more, the parties agree to enter into discussions regarding modifying the inflation factor. If these discussions result in the parties agreeing to a new inflation factor, that new inflation factor will be used to calculate the amount of future payments, unless the Puget Sound Consumer Price Index again rises or falls one full point or more from the new inflation factor, in which case, the parties agree to enter into new discussions regarding modifying the inflation factor. In addition to the impact compensation payment, during each year of this contract, the City will pay the County an additional $84,653 as retroactive payment for prior years. This retroactive payment will not be adjusted from year to year, but will remain the same each year.

 The parties agree that the annual payments to the County include funds the County has agreed to distribute on behalf of the City to the towns of Metaline, Metaline Falls, and Ione, and to the Selkirk, Cusick, and Newport School Districts as detailed in Sections (c), (d) and (e) below:

 (c) The County agrees to make annual payments on behalf of the City to the towns of Metaline, Metaline Falls, and Ione as follows: 1999 - Annual payment of $14,460 to each town. The amount of subsequent payments from 2000 through 2008 will be determined by applying the then current inflation factor as set forth in Section (b) above to the portion of the impact compensation payment distributed to the towns of Metaline, Metaline Falls, and Ione.

 (d) The County agrees to make annual payments on behalf of the City to the Selkirk School District as follows: 1999 - Annual payment of $117,482. The amount of subsequent payments from 2000 through 2008 will be determined by applying the then current inflation factor as set forth in Section (b) above to the portion of the impact compensation payment distributed to the Selkirk School District.

 (e) The County agrees to make annual payments on behalf of the City to the Cusick and Newport School Districts as follows: Cusick School District - $25,631 each year from 1999 through 2008. This amount will not be adjusted under the terms of Section (b); Newport School District - $31,457 each year from 1999 through 2008. This amount will not be adjusted under the terms of Section (b).

 In the event that the inflation factor of 3.1% is not adjusted during the term of this agreement, Seattle City Light will pay to Pend Oreille County the sums set forth below, and Pend Oreille County will distribute those funds as detailed below. In the event the inflation factor is changed during the term of this contract, the amounts payable and the distributions will be modified accordingly.

 3. The payments on behalf of the School Districts are not for the support of basic education and are not to be used for that purpose. These funds are intended to provide compensation to the districts for the special impacts of the operation of the City's project on said School Districts. These funds may be used for special school projects so long as those projects are in some manner utilized to minimize the impact of the Boundary Project.

 4. In the event laws or applicable regulations of the State of Washington or other appropriate jurisdictions are revised, interpreted, construed or applied in a manner that payments to the School Districts contemplated hereunder are "equalized" or otherwise treated so as to reduce the amounts of financial assistance otherwise available to said School Districts, then the annual payments hereunder payable by the City to the County on behalf of such School Districts shall be reduced in the same amount as the reduction of financial assistance otherwise available to said School Districts as set forth above. The County in return will not be obligated to make such payments to the above school districts during such school years.

 5. Each party shall have the right to terminate this Contract by giving one-year written notice to the other party. In the event of termination, the City shall be liable for payments in accordance with the terms of this Contract for services rendered prior to the effective date of termination.

 6. One year prior to the delivery of the last annual payment to the County authorized by Paragraph 2 hereof, this contract shall be subject to renegotiation pursuant to the terms and conditions of RCW 35.21.425.
