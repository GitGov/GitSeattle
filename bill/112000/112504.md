 AN ORDINANCE rezoning property located east of Hiawatha Pl. S., between S. Dearborn and S. Charles Streets, and property on the southwest corner of Davis Pl. S. and S. Dearborn Street, to implement proposed rezones DH4a and DH4b of the Central Area Neighborhood Plan.

 Whereas, Ordinance 119218, passed by the City Council on November 2, 1998, and signed by the Mayor on November 12, 1998, rezoned property in response to the Central Area Neighborhood Plan; and

 Whereas, one of the rezone maps, which was intended to be included in Ordinance 119218, was inadvertently omitted from the ordinance; and

 Whereas, the omitted map was intended to rezone property in the Dearborn-Hiawatha area, and the omitted rezones and map were identified as rezone numbers DH4a and DH4b, which would rezone, to a neighborhood Commercial 3/Residential-40' (NC3/R-40') designation, property zoned Commercial 1-40' (C1-40') east of Hiawatha Pl. between S. Dearborn and S. Charles Streets, and property zoned Lowrise 2 (L2) west of the Cedar River Pipeline (the triangular parcel on southwest corner of Davis Pl. S. and S. Dearborn); and

 Whereas, the City Council intended to include the inadvertently omitted map in Ordinance 119218; and

 Whereas, consideration of the rezones DH4a and DH4b was part of an extensive neighborhood planning process from 1995 to June of 1998, including numerous outreach events and public activities, and a Land Use and Zoning Forum with over 120 people in attendance, and

 Whereas, a City Council public hearing on the proposed Central Area Neighborhood Plan and the proposed rezones, including DH4a and DH4b, was held on Wednesday, September 2, 1998 after wide public notice, including mailing of a separate notice of the proposed rezones to all properties within 300 feet of the proposed rezone areas, including the properties to be rezoned; and

 Whereas, the City Council NGP&CE Committee considered public comment, both in writing and in testimony from its public hearing, considered detailed executive and Council staff analysis of the proposed rezones, and recommended to the full City Council the approval of a number of rezones, including the DH4a and DH4b rezones; and

 Whereas, the City Council finds that the rezoning established by this ordinance will protect and promote the health, safety and welfare of the general public, and implement the Central Area Action Plan II;

 NOW, THEREFORE,

 BE IT ORDAINED BY THE CITY OF SEATTLE AS FOLLOWS:
