 AN ORDINANCE relating to enforcement of the Housing and Building Maintenance Code, amending the enforcement process for certain violations of Title 22 of the Seattle Municipal Code, amending Section 22.202.050(F), and adding a new Chapter 22.207.

 WHEREAS, the current enforcement system for processing Housing and Building Maintenance Code violations recognizes that the majority of citizens will voluntarily comply with the code requirements once they are aware of a violation on their property; and

 WHEREAS, the current enforcement system can be changed to be more effective in dealing with the more difficult housing cases, particularly those involving repeat offenders and property owners who are unwilling to comply with the City's requirements; and

 WHEREAS, it is appropriate that the Housing and Building Maintenance Code should discourage repeat violations by imposing increasing penalties; and

 WHEREAS, because substandard living conditions present health and safety risks, it is sometimes appropriate to assess a penalty irrespective of how quickly the violation is cured in order to deter such violations; and

 WHEREAS, the City's ability to improve Housing and Building Maintenance Code enforcement will ultimately result in safer housing conditions for the citizens of Seattle;

 NOW THEREFORE,

 BE IT ORDAINED BY THE CITY OF SEATTLE AS FOLLOWS:

Money from the following sources shall be paid into the Housing and Abatement Account:

 A. Sums recovered by the City as reimbursement for costs incurred by the City for the repair, alteration, stabilization, improvement, vacation and closure, removal or demolition of buildings or structures in accordance with this Code;

 B. Service. The citation may be served by personal service in the manner set forth in RCW 4.28.080 for service of a summons or sent by first class mail, addressed to the last known address of such person(s). Service shall be complete at the time of personal service, or if mailed, three (3) days after the date of mailing. If a citation sent by first class mail is returned as undeliverable, service may be made by posting the citation at a conspicuous place on the property.

 Section 4. A new Section 22.207.006 is hereby added to the Seattle Municipal Code, to read as follows:

 22.207.006 Response to citations.

 Within fifteen (15) days after the date the citation is served, a person must respond to a citation in one of the following ways:

 Requesting in writing a mitigation hearing to explain the circumstances surrounding the commission of the violation and providing a mailing address to which notice of such hearing may be sent; or

 Requesting a contested hearing in writing specifying the reason why the cited violation did not occur or why the person cited is not responsible for the violation, and providing a mailing address to which notice of such hearing may be sent.

 Section 5. A new Section 2.207.008 is hereby added to the Seattle Municipal Code, to read as follows:

 22.207.008 Failure to respond.

 If a person fails to respond to a citation within fifteen (15) days of service, an order shall be entered by the Hearing Examiner finding that the person cited committed the violation stated in the citation, and assessing the penalty specified in the citation.

 Section 6. A new Section 22.207.010 is hereby added to the Seattle Municipal Code, to read as follows:

 22.207.010 Mitigation Hearings.

 Date and Notice. If a person requests a mitigation hearing, the mitigation hearing shall be held within thirty (30) days after written response to the citation requesting such hearing is received by the Hearing Examiner. Notice of the time, place, and date of the hearing will be sent by first class mail to the address provided in the request for hearing not less than ten (10) days prior to the date of the hearing.

 Procedure at Hearing. The Hearing Examiner shall hold an informal hearing, which shall not be governed by the Rules of Evidence. The person cited may present witnesses, but witnesses may not be compelled to attend. A representative from DCLU may also be present and may present additional information, but attendance by a representative from DCLU is not required.

 Disposition. The Hearing Examiner shall determine whether the person's explanation justifies reduction of the monetary penalty; however, the monetary penalty may not be reduced unless the person provides at the hearing a certificate of compliance from DCLU that the violation has been corrected prior to the mitigation hearing. Factors that may be considered in whether to reduce the penalty include whether the violation was caused by the act, neglect, or abuse of another; or whether correction of the violation was commenced promptly prior to citation but that full compliance was prevented by a condition or circumstance beyond the control of the person cited.

 Entry of Order. After hearing the explanation of the person cited and any other information presented at the hearing, the Hearing Examiner shall enter an order finding that the person cited committed the violation and assessing a monetary penalty in an amount determined pursuant to this section.

 Section 7. A new Section 22.207.012 is hereby added to the Seattle Municipal Code, to read as follows:

 22.207.012 Contested case hearing.

 Date and Notice. If a person requests a contested case hearing, the hearing shall be held within sixty (60) days after the written response to the citation requesting such hearing is received.

 Hearing. Contested case hearings shall be conducted pursuant to the procedures for hearing contested cases contained in Section 3.02.090 and the rules adopted by the Hearing Examiner for hearing contested cases, except as modified by this section. The issues heard at the hearing shall be limited to those raised in writing in the response to the citation and that are within the jurisdiction of the Hearing Examiner. The Hearing Examiner may issue subpoenas for the attendance of witnesses and the production of documents.

 Sufficiency. No citation shall be deemed insufficient for failure to contain a detailed statement of the facts constituting the specific violation which the person cited is alleged to have committed or by reason of defects or imperfections, provided such lack of detail, or defects or imperfections do not prejudice substantial rights of the person cited.

 Amendment of Citation. A citation may be amended prior to the conclusion of the hearing to conform to the evidence presented if substantial rights of the person cited are not thereby prejudiced.

 Evidence at Hearing. The certified statement or declaration authorized by RCW 9A.72.085 submitted by an inspector shall be prima facie evidence that a violation occurred and that the person cited is responsible. The certified statement or declaration of the inspector authorized under RCW 9A.72.085 and any other evidence accompanying the report shall be admissible without further evidentiary foundation. Any certifications or declarations authorized under RCW 9A.72.085 shall also be admissible without further evidentiary foundation. The person cited may rebut the DCLU evidence and establish that the cited violation(s) did not occur or that the person contesting the citation is not responsible for the violation.

 Disposition. If the citation is sustained at the hearing, the Hearing Examiner shall enter an order finding that the person cited committed the violation. If the violation remains uncorrected, the Hearing Examiner shall impose the applicable penalty. The Hearing Examiner may reduce the monetary penalty in accordance with the mitigation provisions in Section 22.207.010 if the violation has been corrected. If the Hearing Examiner determines that the violation did not occur, the Hearing Examiner shall enter an order dismissing the citation.

 Appeal. The Hearing Examiner's decision shall be final unless one of the parties initiates review by writ of certiorari in King County Superior Court within fifteen (15) days after entry of the Hearing Examiner's decision.

 Section 8. A new Section 22.207.014 is hereby added to the Seattle Municipal Code, to read as follows:

 22.207.014 Failure to appear for hearing.

 Failure to appear for a requested hearing will result in an order being entered finding that the person cited committed the violation stated in the citation and assessing the penalty specified in the citation. For good cause shown and upon terms the Hearing Examiner deems just, the Hearing Examiner may set aside an order entered upon a failure to appear.

 Section 9. A new Section 22.207.016 is hereby added to the Seattle Municipal Code, to read as follows:

 22.207.016 Penalties.
