 ORDINANCE ______

 AN ORDINANCE related to the Consultant Contracting Ordinance; adding, amending, and repealing various provisions of Seattle Municipal Code Ch. 3.114 to allow an expanded City-wide Consultant Roster Program and to clarify the process to be used for the program; and making other amendments thereto.

 WHEREAS, the City of Seattle is conducting a City-wide study to identify improvements to its procurement processes under the Copernicus Project, and one objective of the Copernicus Project is to review and modify, as appropriate, the process used to select and hire consultants to perform professional services for the City; and

 WHEREAS, the Consultant Roster Program, originally established in 1986, is a useful tool in the consultant selection and hiring processes; and

 WHEREAS, the current Consultant Rosters were to expire in October, 1998, but were extended until December 31, 1999 in order to provide time for the Copernicus Project to recommend changes to the City-wide Consultant Roster Program; and

 WHEREAS, small businesses represent a majority of the businesses in the state, provide nearly one-half of all jobs in the state, and are very important to the city's economy and vibrance; and

 WHEREAS, promoting the use of small businesses can strengthen the city and particularly economically distressed areas; and

 WHEREAS, the intent of the City-wide Consultant Roster is to make contracting methods clear; balance competing goals; be accountable to budget constraints and social goals; be flexible, while maintaining enforceable guidelines; and be as cost-effective as possible for departments, the City as a whole, and the City's business partners; and

 WHEREAS, the City looked at best practices in agencies around the country and used this information to redesign the City's Consultant Roster Program; Now, therefore,

Section 2. Seattle Municipal Code Section 3.114.040 is amended to read as follows:

 SMC 3.114.040 Consultant selection criteria.

 A. The Executive Services Director is hereby authorized and directed to adopt rules and regulations regarding the procedures by which City departments or Executive Department offices seek out qualified applicants and contract with consultants for work; provided, that under such rules and regulations, consultants shall be selected on the basis of, among other factors, their competence and qualifications for the type of services to be provided, the cost, price, compensation, or consideration to be paid by the City for such services, and the affirmative action/equal opportunity record of the consultant. Until such time as the Executive Services Director adopts such rules and regulations, all rules and regulations of the Board of Public Works shall remain in full force and effect, notwithstanding the abolition of such board, and all references in such rules and regulations to the "Board of Public Works" shall be treated as references to the Executive Services Director.

 Section 3. Seattle Municipal Code Section 3.114.050 is amended to read as follows:

 SMC 3.114.050 Consultant evaluation committee.

 Whenever a City department, City Commissions, or Executive Department office desires consultant services estimated to cost Twenty Thousand Dollars ($20,000.00) or more, as adjusted pursuant to SMC Section 3.114.140, the head of the concerned department or Executive Department office shall appoint and utilize a consultant evaluation committee of not less than three (3) members and representative, where practical, of women and minorities. Each consultant evaluation committee shall review the proposals, applications, questionnaires, and related materials submitted by consultants interested in providing the particular service(s) sought by the concerned department or Executive Department office, and on the basis of the specific written evaluation criteria announced with respect to such consultant selection, report in writing, to the head of the concerned department or Executive Department office its recommendations including, where possible, the ranking of the top five (5) consultants evaluated. ~~, or such greater number as deemed appropriate for a certified consultant roster pursuant to SMC Sections 3.114.150 and 3.114.160~~The written report,~~and~~ where appropriate, shall describe the lack of measurable differences among consultants evaluated, together with such explanation of evaluation processes used as is necessary to fully advise such official of the committee's evaluation results.

 Section 6. Seattle Municipal Code Section 3.114.160 is repealed and replaced with the following new Section 3.114.160:

 SMC 3.114.160 Establishment and operation of rosters.

 These provisions apply to the establishment, maintenance and use of consultant rosters:

 A. Establishment and Duration.

 1. The Executive Service Department, in conjunction with participating departments, shall determine the number of consultant rosters to be established based on the different consultant skills or services that the City is likely to need during the time that the consultant rosters are expected to be in effect. An evaluation committee for the Consultant Roster Program will be created to perform the evaluation process.

Requests for Qualifications (RFQ) for placement on a consultant roster. The Executive Services Department, in conjunction with participating departments, shall issue RFQ(s) to establish consultant rosters for use by any City department or office. At a minimum, the RFQ shall describe the skills or services needed by the City; the minimum qualifications to be placed on the particular consultant roster; the roster contract dollar limits; the expected duration of the roster, if known; standard contract terms and conditions, if any; and a description of the process to be used for selecting consultants off of the roster.

 3. A consultant roster shall remain in effect until such time as the Executive Services Director determines it is in the best interests of the City to disestablish the roster. City departments may petition for the establishment or disestablishment of a roster, or a roster category where the existing rosters or roster categories do not meet the needs of the department.

 B. Opportunities for Small Business.

 Whenever fifteen (15) or more consultants qualify as "small business concerns" in a single roster category, the category shall consist only of those consultants who are eligible to be classified as a "small business concern." If fourteen (14) or fewer such consultants are qualified, consultants for that roster category shall be selected without regard to their eligibility under the small business criteria. A consultant may evidence its qualification as a "small business concern" by:

 1. Showing its acceptance by the Small Business Administration under the Small Business Act of the United States, 15 USC Section 632, and its implementing regulations, 13 CFR Part 121; or,

 2. Showing certification as defined in any City program designed to encourage the utilization of small businesses.

 C. Limitations.

 1. A participating department may contract with the consultants on the roster for projects estimated to cost no more than $200,000 (except as may be adjusted in Section 3.114.160 (C)(2).

 2. A participating department may amend any roster contract for additional work related to the original roster contract up to a maximum of twenty five percent (25%) of the original contract amount. In no case shall the total Consultant Roster Program contract amount, including all amendments, exceed $250,000.

 3. Each participating department may only use a certified roster consultant annually up to a maximum amount of $400,000 per roster category. Any consultant that reaches this limit within any calendar year shall not be selected from that certified roster category for use by that participating department for the remainder of the calendar year, however, other participating departments shall not be prevented from using that consultant.

 D. Deletion From a Roster/Limits on Eligibility.

 1. A consultant may be deleted from the City's certified roster program at the City's sole discretion. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, common examples of reasons that a consultant may be removed from a roster include, but are not limited to:

 a. The consultant requests deletion (the deletion shall take effect ten (10) business days after notice to the Executive Services Department);

 b. The consultant is found to be in default in the performance of a City contract; is disqualified from City contracting; has failed to file applicable business and occupation tax reports; or does not possess a valid City business license, or other state licenses or certifications necessary to practice the particular profession; or

 c. The consultant has made a material misrepresentation in its response to a solicitation. A misrepresentation is material if the consultant would have been ineligible for placement on a roster if the facts were fully known.

 d. For any other reason that the City deems to be in its interests to do so.

 E. Adding Consultants to a Roster.

 During the existence of a roster, the Executive Services Department in conjunction with participating departments will perform ongoing evaluations of any new consultant response to an RFQ(s). All consultants found to be qualified for a consultant roster category will be added to that roster, except as a roster category may be limited by SMC Section 3.114.160 (B) and except as a consultant may be ineligible in accordance with SMC Section 3.114.160 (D).

 F. Disclaimer.

 Placement on a consultant roster makes a consultant eligible for consideration and possible selection by a participating department for providing services, all as more fully described or limited in the City's RFQ. Placement on a roster does not guarantee any consultant any contract for any amount. In addition, the City reserves the power to amend or repeal this chapter and to change or discontinue the roster system at any time.

 G. Evaluation Criteria.

 Consultants shall be evaluated for placement on a roster on the basis of the ability of the consultant to perform the work or service that the roster category was created for and to meet the minimum qualifications set forth in the request for qualifications.

 Section 7. Repealer. SMC Sections 3.114.020, 3.114.145 and 3.114.170 of the Seattle Municipal Code are repealed in their entirety.

 Section 8. Any act consistent with the authority and prior to the effective date of this ordinance is hereby ratified and confirmed.

 Section 9. The provisions of this ordinance shall take effect on January 1, 2000.

 Section 10. This ordinance shall take effect and be in force thirty (30) days from and after its approval by the Mayor, but if not approved and returned by the Mayor within ten (10) days after presentation, it shall take effect as provided by Municipal Code Section 1.04.020.
