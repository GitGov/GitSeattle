 Section 1. The permit granted to U S WEST Communications, Inc. a Colorado corporation by Ordinance 96413 to maintain and operate a pedestrian tunnel under and across the alley east of Third Avenue, north of Spring Street is hereby renewed for a ten (10) year period ending January 30, 2008 upon terms and conditions set fourth in Ordinance 96413.

 Section 2. That Section 7 of Ordinance 96413 is hereby amended to read as follows: Section 7. (( ~~So long as the Permittee, shall exercise any privilege or authority granted by this ordinance, it shall provide and maintain in full force and effect, public liability insurance in connection with the construction, operation, maintenance and use of the tunnel herein authorized, with the City as an additional insured, providing for a limit of not less than Three Hundred Thousand Dollars ($300,000), for all damages arising out of bodily injuries to or death of one person, and subject to that limit for each person, a total limit of not less than One Million Dollars ($1,000,000.00), for all damages arising out of bodily injuries to or death of two or more persons in any one accident; and property damage liability insurance providing for a limit of not less than One Hundred Thousand Dollars ($100,000) for all damages arising out of injury to or destruction of property in any one accident; Provided, however, that whenever in the judgment of the Mayor of The City of Seattle, such public liability insurance filed pursuant to the provisions hereof shall be deemed insufficient to fully protect The City of Seattle, the Permittee, its successors or assigns, shall, upon demand by said Mayor, furnish additional insurance in such amount as may be specified by said Mayor. A copy of such policy or certificate evidencing the same shall be filed in the office of the City Comptroller prior to the construction pursuant to this ordinance or other use of said street and shall provide for ten (10) days notice to the City of any change, cancellation or lapse thereof.~~ ))  For as long as the Permittee, its successors and assigns, shall exercise any permission granted by this ordinance and until the pedestrian tunnel is entirely removed from its location as described in Section 1, or until discharged by order of the Director of Seattle Transportation as provided in Section 2 of this ordinance, the Permittee shall obtain and maintain in full force and effect, at its own expense, insurance policies which protect the City from any all claims and risks in conjunction with:

(a) reconstruction, operation, maintenance, use or existence of the pedestrian tunnel permitted by this ordinance and of any and all portions of the tunnel;

 (b) the Permittee's activity upon or the use or occupation of the area described in Section 1of this ordinance, as well as;

(c) any and all claims and risks in conjunction with and activity performed by the Permittee by virtue of the permission granted by this ordinance.  Minimum insurance requirements shall be an occurrence form policy of commercial general liability, placed with a company admitted and licensed to conduct business in Washington State. Minimum policy limits shall be $2,000,000 per occurrence, $4,000,000 annual aggregate. Coverage shall specifically name the pedestrian tunnel exposure. Coverage shall add by endorsement The City of Seattle, its elected and appointed officers, officials, employees and agents as additional insured. Coverage shall contain a Separation of Insureds Clause indicating essentially that " except with respect to the limits of insurance, and any rights or duties specifically assigned in this coverage part to the first named insured, this insurance applies as if each named insured were the only named insured, and separately to each insured against whom claim is made or suit is brought". Evidence of current coverage shall be submitted to the City in the form of a copy of the full insurance policy endorsements attached thereto, and is a condition to the validity of this permit.

 Whenever in the judgment of the Risk Manager of The City of Seattle, such insurance filed pursuant to the provisions hereof shall be deemed insufficient to fully protect The City of Seattle, the Permittee shall, upon demand by the Risk Manager, furnish additional insurance in such amounts as may be specified by the Risk Manager.

Should Permittee be self-insured, a letter from the Corporate Risk Manager, or appropriate Finance Officer, is acceptable, stipulating if actuarially funded and funds limit: plus any excess declaration pages to meet the contract requirements. Further, this letter shall advise how Permittee would protect and defend the City of Seattle as an Additional Insured in their Self-Insured layer, and include claims handling directions in the event of a claim.

 Section 3. Pursuant to Section 2 of Ordinance 96413, U S WEST Communications, Inc. shall promptly pay to the City upon statements rendered by the Director of Transportation, a fee of Six Hundred Dollars ($600.00) annually until January 30, 2003. The fee will then be evaluated by the City and a new fee will be established by resolution of the City Council for the next five years of the permit.

 All payments shall be made to the City of Seattle Finance Director for credit to the General Fund.

 Section 4. This ordinance shall take effect and be in force thirty (30) days from and after its approval by the Mayor, but if not approved and returned by the Mayor within ten (10) days after presentation, it shall take effect as provided by Municipal Code Section 1.04.020
