 Section 1. General Municipal and Firefighters' Pension.

 A. (i) There is hereby levied a tax on all taxable property, both real and personal, within the City of Seattle and subject to taxation under the laws of the State of Washington, at the rate of Three Dollars and Sixty Cents ($3.60) per thousand dollars of the assessed value of such property, which is equal to Two Hundred and Four Million, Thirty-three Thousand, Six Hundred Dollars ($204,033,600) (subject to the limits stated in subsection 1.B). This tax is levied for the purpose of raising revenue to finance the various departments and activities of the municipal government of the City of Seattle for the fiscal (calendar) year 2000. This levy has been calculated at the following dollar rates per thousand dollars of assessed value: Three Dollars and Fifteen Cents ($3.15) for general municipal purposes as allowed by RCW 84.52.043; Twenty-two and One-half Cents ($0.225) for the Firemen's Pension Fund as allowed by RCW 41.16.060; and Twenty-two and One-half Cents ($0.225) for general municipal purposes as allowed by RCW 41.16.060. This levy includes an amount of Eight Hundred Twenty-eight Thousand Dollars ($828,000) for low-income housing that is not restricted to serving very low-income households, in accordance with Ordinance 117711; an amount of Thirteen Million Dollars ($13,000,000) for educational and developmental services in accordance with Ordinance 118557; and an amount of Eighteen Million Five Hundred Thousand Dollars ($18,500,000) to improve the Opera House, replace the Flag Pavilion, and expand nine Parks Department community recreation centers in accordance with Ordinance 119522.

 (ii) In addition, there is also hereby levied a tax on all taxable property, both real and personal, within the City of Seattle and subject to taxation under the laws of the State of Washington, in the amount of Seven Million, Six Hundred Thirty Thousand, Seven Hundred Sixteen Dollars ($7,630,716), such tax being levied for the purpose of financing affordable housing for very low-income households pursuant to RCW 84.52.105, pursuant to Ordinance 117711, which tax levy shall be outside of and in addition to the limitations in RCW 84.52.043.

 B. If the total of the amounts of taxes stated in subsections 1.A(i) and (ii) or the total of the tax rate stated in subsection 1.A(i) and the rate necessary to generate the amount of taxes stated in subsection 1.A.(ii) would be in excess of any maximum allowed by law or by vote of the people of the City of Seattle pursuant to RCW 84.55.050, then such taxes shall be reduced to the maximum amount allowed or the maximum rate allowed. The maximum amount of regular property taxes allowed by vote of the people shall be determined for purposes of this subsection as follows: There shall be determined the amount of regular City property taxes that could have been levied for collection in 2000 had the voters approved none of the levy lid lift measures submitted pursuant to RCW 84.55.050 and Ordinances 117711, 118557, and 119522.
