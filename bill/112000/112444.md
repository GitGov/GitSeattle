 ORDINANCE _________________

 WHEREAS, the City of Seattle, WSDOT, King County, the Port of Seattle, Burlington Northern Santa Fe Railway Company, and the Washington State Major League Baseball Stadium Public Facilities District have previously entered into an agreement concerning the design, construction and funding of the SR519 Intermodal Access Project, which includes the Weller Street pedestrian bridge; and

 WHEREAS, the City Council authorized the City's participation in the SR519 Intermodal Access project in Ordinance 118160; and

 WHEREAS, the City's contribution to the construction cost of the bridge falls under agreements for funding of design and construction of the SR519 project as a whole; and

 WHEREAS, King County has secured federal grant money to fund construction of the bridge, but with recent ballot measures approving funding of a regional transit system and a new football stadium/exhibition hall, which will result in transfer of ownership of the bus tunnel to Sound Transit and the Kingdome site to the PSA and First and Goal Inc., the County will no longer have property interests in the area; and

 WHEREAS, King County has agreed to build the bridge with the federal grant money, but only on condition that another government agency take ownership of the bridge once completed; and

 WHEREAS, the Weller Street pedestrian bridge is an important component of the South Downtown pedestrian network and will allow convenient connections to rail and transit in particular; and

 WHEREAS, the Weller Street pedestrian bridge will provide a pedestrian connection over the Burlington Northern Santa Fe mainline railroad tracks from Fourth Avenue South to the north Kingdome parking lot and the location of a planned new street at Third Avenue South, and will also connect to commuter rail and intercity rail platforms at King Street Station; and

 WHEREAS, the Weller Street pedestrian bridge will serve a number of pedestrian needs, including connections from commuter rail and intercity rail to light rail and local bus service, from football and baseball stadiums to light rail and the Union Station parking garage, and from the Pioneer Square neighborhood to the International District neighborhood; and

 WHEREAS, in 1985 the City Council adopted the Land Use and Transportation Plan for Downtown Seattle which called for improved pedestrian connections between Pioneer Square and the International District south of S. Jackson Street; and

 WHEREAS, the City of Seattle as part of the South Downtown Strategic Plan and south Downtown Investment Strategy is seeking to form partnerships with public and private stakeholders to provide infrastructure and service needed for the future health, vitality and functioning of the South Downtown area: and

 WHEREAS, under the attached agreement, the City's share of annual operating and maintenance expenses shall be 20 percent of the total for the life of the bridge structure, with the remainder to be paid by Sound Transit, King County and the PSA;

 NOW THEREFORE,

 BE IT ORDAINED BY THE CITY OF SEATTLE AS FOLLOWS
