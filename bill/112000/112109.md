 AN ORDINANCE relating to filling appointive City offices; amending Seattle Municipal Code section 3.40.010 to clarify provisions governing the length of the term of the City Auditor; and amending Seattle Municipal Code section 3.92.010 to encompass vacancies in the office of the City Auditor.

 WHEREAS, in 1991 the voters of Seattle amended the City Charter to provide for an independent City Auditor, appointed by the chair of the City Council Finance Committee for a six-year term and subject to confirmation by and removal for cause by a majority of the City Council; and

 WHEREAS, the City Council adopted legislation in 1992 to specify that the term of the first City Auditor would commence upon that Auditor's confirmation by the City Council; and

 WHEREAS, Nora Masters was confirmed as the first City Auditor under that new Charter provision effective February 8, 1993, and resigned effective February 2, 1998; and

 WHEREAS, the City Charter is not explicitly clear as to whether a new City Auditor would be appointed during 1998 only to fill the remainder of the six years since Ms. Masters' confirmation or whether the new City Auditor would commence a full six-year term from the date of his or her confirmation; and

 WHEREAS, the City Council believes it was the intent of the voters of Seattle to provide for a full six-year term for each newly appointed City Auditor in order to provide the most independence for the Auditor consistent with the oversight role of the City Council; and

 WHEREAS, the independence of an incumbent City Auditor seeking reappointment is best assured through an early decision by the City Council on the possible reappointment; and

 WHEREAS, in other situations where City Code has provided for appointive officers' terms of a definite number of years, appointees replacing a departing incumbent part-way through the prior incumbent's term have been appointed for a new full term (such as with the former Water Superintendent confirmed in January 1995); and

 WHEREAS, Chapter 3.92 of the Seattle Municipal Code provides for the temporary performance of the duties of Charter officers appointed by the Mayor when those offices are vacant, but needs to be updated to provide for the temporary performance of the duties of the City Auditor, who is the only Charter officer appointed by the Legislative department of City government;

 NOW, THEREFORE,

 BE IT ORDAINED BY THE CITY OF SEATTLE AS FOLLOWS:

 Section 1. Section 3.40.010 of the Seattle Municipal Code is amended as follows:

 3.40.010 City Auditor-Duties-Appointment.

A. There is established in the Legislative Department an office of City Auditor to perform the duties provided in Article VIII, Section 2 of the City Charter. The City Auditor shall have a term of six (6) years, and shall be appointed by the Chair of the Finance Committee, subject to confirmation by a majority of the City Council, and may be removed for cause by a majority of the City Council.

B. The first term of the City Auditor shall commence upon the effective date of confirmation by the City Council. Succeeding terms that are not consecutive terms for the same individual shall commence for six years upon confirmation of the new City Auditor, regardless of the length of term served by the preceding City Auditor.  Consecutive terms for the same individual shall commence for six additional years from the date that individual's previous term expires if the incumbent is reappointed and reconfirmed within ninety (90) days before or ninety (90) days after the expiration of the previous term; otherwise the successive term shall commence upon reconfirmation. If an incumbent seeks reappointment, the Chair of the Finance Committee should propose action, and the City Council should act upon a proposal, at least forty-five (45) days before the expiration of the incumbent's term.

 Section 2. Section 3.92.010 of the Seattle Municipal Code is amended as follows:

 3.92.010 Filling of vacant position.

A. If any appointive Charter office to be filled by mayoral appointment or the position of department or office head in any department or office created by ordinance becomes vacant, to ensure that the department or office functions and the interest of the public is protected pending the filling of such vacancy under Charter Article XIX, Section 6, or applicable ordinance, the highest-ranking unsubordinated officer or employee in such department or office shall perform, in addition to his/her regular duties, the duties of such appointive office unless the Mayor determines, and the President of the City Council and the Chair of the City Council Finance Committee concur, and so indicate their concurrence in writing filed with the City Clerk, that the interests of the City would be better served by the designation of another person of the Mayor's choosing to serve as acting head of such department or office.

B. If the appointive Charter office of City Auditor becomes vacant, to ensure that the office functions and the interest of the public is protected pending the filling of such vacancy, the highest- ranking unsubordinated officer or employee in the City Auditor's office shall perform, in addition to his/her regular duties, the duties of such appointive office unless the Chair of the City Council Finance Committee determines, and the President of the City Council concurs, and so indicates his/her concurrence in writing filed with the City Clerk, that the interests of the City would be better served by the designation of another identified person to serve as acting head of such office.

 Section 3. This ordinance shall take effect and be in force thirty (30) days from and after its

 approval by the Mayor, but if not approved and returned by the Mayor within ten (10) days after presentation, it shall take effect as provided by Municipal Code Section 1.04.020.
