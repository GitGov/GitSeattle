 AN ORDINANCE relating to the Police Department; creating positions in support of Operation Impound.

 WHEREAS, Ordinance 119180, passed by the City Council on October 12, 1998, authorizes officers to impound a vehicle when it is being operated by a driver who has a suspended driver's license; and

 WHEREAS, the vehicle is then held for a pre-determined amount of time, based on the degree of the driver's suspension and prior driving with license suspended convictions; and

 WHEREAS, it has been determined that the temporary administrative support authorized in the 1999 Budget in support of Operation Impound does not give the Police Department the capacity to readily process program records for the zero-day holds within twenty-four hours of impound; and

 WHEREAS, the Chief of Police has presented a staffing proposal that would provide for seven day a week coverage, with expanded 16-hour staffing Sunday through Thursday, that would make it easier for impound records to be processed and the zero-day holds released within twenty-four hours of impound; and
