 AN ORDINANCE relating to land use and zoning, amending the Official Land Use Map, SMC Chapter 23.32, to rezone properties located within the area generally bounded by Martin Luther King Junior Way South and 46th Avenue South and South Andover Street and South Lucille Street; and amending SMC Chapter 23.47, relating to single purpose residential development, to implement the Columbia City- Hillman City-Genesee Neighborhood Plan.

 Whereas, the Seattle City Council finds that the rezoning established by this ordinance will protect and promote the health, safety and welfare of the general public, and implement the Columbia City-Hillman City-Genesee Neighborhood Plan, and

 Whereas, the Columbia City-Hillman City-Genesee Neighborhood Plan recommends a number of rezones to encourage the development of a diverse, connected, attractive, healthy and vibrant neighborhood, and

 Whereas, Council has adopted Sound Transit's proposed light rail alignment that includes a station at M. L. King Jr. Way S. and S. Edmonds St., and Council has committed resources to a Station Area Plan process that will help achieve the City of Seattle and Sound Transit's common policy objectives of fostering transit-oriented development, supportive land use planning around transit stations, and development of public/private partnerships to promote transit oriented development and community objectives; and

 Whereas, the Columbia City-Hillman City-Genesee Neighborhood Plan's rezone recommendations preceded the final selection of a Sound Transit light rail alignment, and Council has 1) considered proposed rezones E and F, 2) found the parcels identified in proposals E and F to be within the M. L. King Jr. Way S. and S. Edmonds St. station area planning boundaries, 3) decided to table further consideration of proposals E and F pending recommendations from the Station Area Plan process, and 4) will continue its consideration of this legislative proposal as part of the Station Area Plan process at a later time; and

 Whereas, following discussion and deliberation, the Council has decided to remove proposed Rezone S from further consideration at this time; and

 Whereas, the Council has considered whether to rezone property on Martin Luther King, Jr. Way S., identified in "Proposal D", as part of its legislative process to establish policies, zoning and other land use regulations within the Columbia City, Hillman City, and Genessee areas, andthe Council wishes to conduct additional analysis to determine which zoning classification the property should be rezoned to,
