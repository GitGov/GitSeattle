 AN ORDINANCE relating to compensation for performance of out-of- class duties, retitling and amending Seattle Municipal Code Section 4.20.300; and establishing a new subsection A to include definitions; creating new titles and pay rates for out-of-class assignments to Manager and Strategic Advisor classifications.

 4.20.300 Payment for performance of out-of-class and limited term assignment duties.

 A. Definitions

1. "Limited term assignment" shall mean the temporary assignment of duties and responsibilities typically associated with one position to the incumbent ("assignee") of another position when the assignee's position is allocated to the Manager or Strategic Advisor classification and compensation programs.

2."Out-of-class assignment" shall mean the temporary assignment of duties and responsibilities associated with a higher-paid position to the incumbent of a lower-paid position when the incumbent's position is not included in the Manager, Strategic Advisor, or APEX programs.

3."Proper authority" shall be the appointing authority or his or her designated management representative.

4."Threshold" shall mean the amount of time an employee must perform out-of-class or limited term assignment duties prior to being compensated for the performance of those duties. The threshold shall consist of consecutive work hours or work days. The threshold must be satisfied for each out-of-class or limited term assignment.

B. Except as otherwise provided in authorized collective bargaining agreements, qualified employees assigned by proper authority to perform the ongoing duties and accept the responsibilities of a higher-paid classification or position  in order to avoid a significant interruption of work or services shall be paid ~~at the rate established for such higher-paid classification as in promotion~~as provided herein while performing such duties. Each out-of-class or limited term  assignment is limited to six (6) months unless an extension is approved by the appointing authority. Appropriate reasons for ~~considering~~ the assignment of out-of-class or limited term assignment duties include:

 1. Absence of a position incumbent; 2. Peak workload periods; 3. Position vacancy; or 4. Completion of a special project.

~~B. An employee whose primary job title is eligible for overtime pay shall perform the ongoing duties of a higher-paid classification for a minimum of four (4) consecutive hours to be eligible for the higher pay rate. An employee whose primary job title is not eligible for overtime shall perform such duties for a minimum of two (2) consecutive weeks to be eligible for the higher pay rate.~~ ))

C. An employee whose regular position is not included in the APEX, Manager or Strategic Advisor programs may be assigned to work out-of-class in a higher-paid position that is not included in the APEX, Manager or Strategic Advisor programs; or may be assigned to work out-of-class in a position that is allocated to a Manager or Strategic Advisor classification. Unless approved by the Classification and Compensation Director of the Personnel Division of the Executive Services Department, an employee who is not a Manager or Strategic Advisor may not be assigned to work out-of-class in an APEX position.

1.Payment for the out-of-class assignment shall be determined as in promotion (Seattle Municipal Code Section 4.20.080, Subsection B).

2.The threshold for payment of an out-of-class rate of pay is four (4) hours for hourly employees and ten (10) days for salaried employees.

~~1.~~3. Hours worked in an out-of-class assignment ~~((, including any hours in an assignment that was in effect on January 20, 1996~~,)) will be credited toward salary step placement in the event the employee who was so assigned is promoted, or his or her position reclassified, to the same class as the out-of-class assignment, within twelve (12) months of the end of such out-of-class assignment; except that hours worked in an out-of-class assignment to a Manager or Strategic Advisor classification shall not be counted toward salary placement in the event of promotion or reclassification to a Manager or Strategic Advisor classification.

~~2~~.)) 4.For each consecutive twelve (12) month period that ~~When~~ an employee is assigned to perform the same out-of-class duties on a full-time, continuous basis ~~for twelve (12) months or longer~~, he or she will receive a step increment in the higher salary range; provided, that he or she has not already received an increment because of increases to the primary pay rate; provided further, that such increment does not exceed the top step of the higher salary range. ~~This provision shall apply to any hours worked in a continuous assignment prior to January 20, 1996 when such assignment was still in effect on January 20, 1996, and shall apply to all assignments made on or after January 20,1996~~.))

D.A Manager or Strategic Advisor may be assigned by proper authority to perform some or all of the duties associated with another classification or position on a limited term assignment. The appointing authority may grant a temporary increase to the employee's base salary to compensate him or her for the limited term assignment, but may not exceed the maximum of the pay zone to which the employee's regular position is allocated; provided, that such employee may be given a limited term assignment to a position assigned to the Accountability Pay for Executives (APEX) Program and paid at the minimum rate of the appropriate market group if such minimum rate exceeds his or her normal rate of pay. The threshold for compensation for a limited term assignment is ten (10) days.

~~C. When an employee or officer serves as acting head of a department of office, payment for the performance of such higher duties shall be as follows:~~

~~1. If the employee or officer is the highest-ranking unsubordinated employee, he or she shall receive his or her regular salary, plus, for all hours worked as acting head, the difference between his or her regular salary and the lowest step of the higher position.~~

~~2. If the Mayor designates someone other than the highest-ranking unsubordinated employee to be acting department or office head, the rate of compensation will be calculated as in promotion.~~

~~D. Compensation for acting head assignments will be paid for up to twelve (12) months after the occurrence of a vacancy. An acting head assignment may continue for up to ninety (90) days of any City Council rejection of a nomination to fill a department or office head vacancy and will terminate when such vacancy is filled on a permanent basis.~~

~~E. An employee who is assigned to perform in an acting capacity the duties, and to accept the responsibilities, of the principal staff assistant to any multi-member City administrative board or commission, will be compensated as in SMC Section 4.20.300 A~~.))

E.An employee who holds an APEX position may be temporarily assigned additional duties normally associated with another APEX position in the same or different market group. Except when such assignment is to be acting head of an employing unit, there shall be no adjustment of the base salary.

F.Any employee may be designated by proper authority to be acting head of an employing unit for up to twelve (12) months following the occurrence of a vacancy, and for up to ninety (90) days after a City Council rejection of a nomination to fill the vacancy. An employee so assigned shall be paid the minimum rate of the market group to which the vacant position is assigned; provided, that application of this provision shall not result in a pay reduction.
