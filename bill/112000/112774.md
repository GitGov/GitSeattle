One member shall be selected by the Mayor, one by the City Council, and one member shall be elected by the civil service employees; all members shall be removed only for cause by their selecting authority. The manner of election and removal of the member representing the civil service employees shall be as provided by ordinance. Should a member of the Commission be unable for any reason to perform any of his or her Commission duties, then the Commission may select a temporary member in a manner to be established by ordinance.

The Commission shall have the power to administer oaths, issue subpoenas, receive relevant evidence, compel the production of documents, question witnesses at hearings which it conducts, and issue such remedial orders as it deems appropriate. In any appeal involving a disciplinary action, the employee shall have the right to cross-examine witnesses, and to ask for the attendance of witnesses and production of relevant evidence.
