 Section 5. Section 22.900D.010. of the Seattle Municipal Code, adopted by Ordinance 119255, is amended as follows:

 22.900D.010 Development permit fees.

 A. General.

 The development fee covers the application, review and inspection process associated with new construction, additions, alterations, and repairs to existing buildings and establishment of use. The development fee consists of a permit fee and, where plans are routed for review, a separate plan review fee. The permit fee and plan review fee are determined based on valuation, except as provided below.

 B. Time of payment of fees.

 Fees collected at the time of application will be based on Department estimates of the total fees due at the time of permit issuance. The final Department fees will be recalculated during review, and any additional amount due shall be collected prior to the issuance of the permit, approval, denial, decision or recommendation, provided that hourly fees may be collected earlier, as described in Section 22.900B.010 D. Any fee in excess of the final calculated fee shall be refunded pursuant to Section 22.900B.050.

 If, during the initial review, the previously-collected fee is determined to be less than 90% of the estimated fee, the review work subsequent to the initial review will not proceed until the discrepancy is paid to the Department.

 1. Amount~~s~~ due prior to application. ~~The following amounts are due prior to application.~~a.

 )) Fees for building preapplication conference shall be paid prior to the conference. See 22.900D.010H for building preapplication conference fees.

~~b. A fee of one times the Base Fee shall be collected at the time a request to establish a computer contact number is filed. If the application is not filed within 12 months, the computer contact number shall be canceled and a new fee required to establish another computer contact number for the project~~.

 2. Amounts due at time of application. The following amounts are due at the time of application.

 a. Applications for building and/or mechanical permits without plan review shall pay a fee for subject-to-field inspection (STFI) permits equal to the Permit Fee specified in Table D-2.

 b. Applications for Building and/or Mechanical permits with plan review shall pay the Plan Review fee plus one-half the Permit Fee as specified in Table D-2.

 c. For other applications, the minimum fee shall be collected at the time of application.

 C. Determination of Value.

 1. The Director shall determine the value of construction for which the permit is issued (the estimated current value of all labor and materials, whether actually paid or not, as well as all finish work, painting, roofing, electrical, plumbing, heating, air-conditioning, elevators, fire-extinguishing systems, automatic sprinkler systems, other mechanical systems, retaining walls, rockeries and any other permanent work or permanent equipment, but not including furnishings). The building valuation data from the International Conference of Building Officials (ICBO) as published in "Building Standards" and other valuation criteria approved by the Director will be used to determine the value of construction.

 2. The gross area, used in conjunction with the ICBO building valuation and other data to determine the valuation of a building project, means the total area of all floors, measured from the exterior face, outside dimensions or exterior column line of a building, including basements, cellars and balconies, but not including unexcavated areas. Where walls and columns are omitted in the construction of a building, such as an open shed or marquee, the exterior wall of the open side or sides, for purposes of calculating gross area, is the edge of the roof, including gutters.

 3. The valuation for uncovered structures such as roof parking areas, plazas, piers, platforms, commercial decks and similar uncovered usable structures shall be computed on one-half the gross area.

 4. Dish or Panel Antennae. The fee for processing applications for installation of a dish or panel antenna shall be charged on the value of the foundation and supports constructed for the installation. The value of the dish or panel antenna shall not be included in the determination of value.

 5. The development fee for parks and playgrounds shall be based on the project value, including the value of improvements for structures incidental to the park or playground such as retaining walls, rockeries and restrooms, but shall not include the value of playground equipment.

 6. The valuation shall be based on the highest type of construction to which a proposed structure most nearly conforms, as determined by the Director.

 D. Phased permits.

 1. When a new building project is proposed to be built in phases and the Director determines that separate development permits may be issued for portions of the project, the development fee for initial permits shall be based on the estimated value of the work under that permit according to Table D-2, except excavating permits shall be based on Section ~~22.900D.040~~22.900D.145. The fee for the final permit shall be the fee based on the total value of the new building project minus the sum of the fees for the initial permits, with no credit for an excavation permit fee.

 2. Where an applicant requests division of an already-submitted permit application into separate applications, an additional fee of one times the Base Fee shall be charged for each separate application (including the original application which results from the division).

 E. Calculation of Development Fees.

 The development fee for a permit shall be calculated as described herein: Table D-1 establishes the Development Fee Index for value- based development fees. Except as specified in Section 22.900D.010 F below, Table D-2 establishes the Permit Fee and Plan Review Fee, calculated as a percentage of the Development Fee Index where determined by value. If two or more buildings are allowed under one permit, they shall be assessed fees as separate buildings under Table D-2. The individual fees shall then be added to determine the total development fee for the permit.

 1. The application fee for a blanket permit to cover initial nonstructural tenant alterations within the first three years of the first tenant alteration permit shall be charged at the rate of $3.20 per 100 square feet of space to be improved within the life of the permit. A deposit based on the estimated value of the work to be completed during the life of the permit shall be collected at the time of application. As individual tenant spaces are reviewed, the amount of the fee equivalent to the floor space examined shall be deducted from the deposit per Table D-2.

 2. The application fee for a blanket permit to cover nonstructural tenant alterations in previously-occupied space, or to cover initial nonstructural tenant alterations after three years of the first tenant alteration permit, is $95.00. A deposit based on the estimated value of the proposed work within 18 months shall be collected at the time of application. As individual tenant spaces are reviewed, the fee for the work to be done shall be calculated according to Table D-2 and deducted from the deposit.

 3. When the estimated blanket fee deposit is used up in less time than the life of the permit and work remains to be done, an additional deposit shall be paid based on the estimated floor area remaining to be improved during the remaining life of the permit. When a portion of the deposit is unused at the end of the life of the permit and work remains to be done, credit for the balance of the deposit may be transferred from the expiring permit to a new blanket permit. To minimize additional accounting costs associated with blanket permits, where more than two deposits are made during the life of a blanket permit, the minimum amount of each subsequent deposit shall be $2,000.00.

 G. Certificate of Occupancy.

 The issuance of a Certificate of Occupancy for existing buildings, either where no Certificate of Occupancy has previously been issued or where a Change of Occupancy is requested, requires a building permit. When there is no construction valuation (there is no work which would require a building permit), the minimum building permit fee shall be assessed. In addition to the minimum building permit fee, where records research, plan examination or inspection is required, charges shall be assessed at the rate of $~~110~~125.00 per hour.

The fee for a temporary Certificate of Occupancy is one-half the Base Fee. The fee for the duplication of a Certificate of Occupancy is $16.00 unless records research, plan examination or inspection is required, in which case charges shall be assessed at the rate of $~~110~~125.00 per hour.

 H. Building Preapplication Conferences.

 1. Required Building Preapplication Conferences. When there is a requirement for a preapplication or predesign conference, such as buildings subject to the Seattle Building Code special provisions for atria (Section 402), or highrise buildings (Section 403), 35% of the estimated plan review fee for the structure shall be charged and paid as specified in Section 22.900D.010.B, and applied toward the development permit fee. (See Table C-1 for land use preapplication conference fees.)

 2. Other Building Preapplication Conferences.

Such fee is required for each meeting held on a project, and will be applied toward the future permit application fee provided:

 a. the project is identified by the proper address at the time of the preapplication conference; and

 b. the permit application is made within six months of the date of the preapplication conference.

 I. Correction Penalty Fee.

 After written notice to the applicant, a penalty fee of $250.00 will be charged for each additional correction cycle required due to lack of adequate response from the applicant.

 J. Refunds.

1. Refunds of development permit fees shall be calculated as specified in Table D-3. See also Section 22.900B.050.
