When the proposed action that is the subject of the certificate of approval is also the subject of one or more related permit applications under review by the Department of Construction and Land Use, then the appellant must also file notice of the appeal with the Department of Construction and Land Use, and the appeal of the certificate of approval shall not be heard until all of the time periods for filing administrative appeals on the other permits have expired except that an appeal of a certificate of approval for the preliminary design or for subsequent design phases may proceed immediately according to 25.22.100 without being consolidated. If one or more appeals are filed regarding the other permits, then the appeal of the certificate of approval shall be consolidated with them and shall be heard according to the same timelines established for the other appeals, except that appeals to the State Shoreline Hearings Board shall proceed independently according to the timelines set by the state for such appeals, and except that an appeal of a certificate of approval for a preliminary design or for a subsequent design phase may proceed according to 25.22.100 without being consolidated. If the related permit decisions would not be appealable, then the appeal of the certificate of approval decision shall proceed immediately after it is filed.

 Section 16. A new Section 25.24.055 is added the Seattle Municipal Code to read:

 25.24.055 Definition.

 "Certificate of approval" is written authorization which must be issued by the Commission before any change to any building, structure or other visible element may be made. The term includes written approval of a preliminary design as well as of subsequent design phases.

 Section 17. Section 25.24.060 of the Seattle Municipal Code, last amended by Ordinance 118012, is further amended as follows:

 25.24.060 Approval of changes to buildings, structures and other visible elements.

 A. No structure or part thereof shall be erected, altered, extended, or reconstructed, and no structure, lot or public place as defined in Section 15.02.040 shall be altered, used or occupied except pursuant to a certificate of approval authorized by the Commission which shall not be transferable; and no building permit shall issue except in conformance with a valid certificate of approval. However, no regulation nor any amendment thereof shall apply to any existing building, structure, or use of land to the extent to which it is used at the time of the adoption of such regulation or amendment or any existing division of land, except that such regulation or amendment may regulate nonuse or a nonconforming use so as not to unduly prolong the life thereof. No new off-premises advertising signs shall be established within the boundaries of the Historical District including public places except where areas have been reserved for groups of signs or for signs which identify the Market District as a whole, as determined by the Commission. The fee for certificates of approval shall be according to the SMC Chapter 22.901T Permit Fee Subtitle

 B. Application.

If an application is made to the Director for a permit for which a certificate of approval is required, the Director of Construction and Land Use shall require the applicant to submit an application to the Commission for a certificate of approval. Submission of the application for a certificate of approval to the Commission shall be required before the permit application to the Department of Construction and Land Use may be determined to be complete.

 2. The following information must be provided in order for the application to be complete, unless the Commission's staff indicate in writing that specific information is not necessary for a particular application:

 a. Business name and business address;

 p. If the proposal includes replacement, removal, or demolition of existing features, a survey of the existing conditions of the features that would be replaced, removed, or demolished.

 3. The staff shall determine whether an application is complete and shall notify the applicant in writing within twenty- eight (28) days of the application being filed whether the application is complete or that the application is incomplete and what additional information is required before the application will be complete. Within fourteen (14) days of receiving the additional information, the staff shall notify the applicant in writing whether the application is now complete or what additional information is necessary. An application shall be deemed to be complete if the staff does not notify the applicant in writing by the deadlines in this section that the application is incomplete. A determination that the application is complete is not a determination that the application is vested.

 4. The determination of completeness does not preclude the staff or the Commission from requiring additional information during the review process if more information is needed to evaluate the application according to the criteria in this chapter and in any rules adopted by the Commission, or if the proposed work changes. For example, additional information that may be required could include a shadow study or a traffic study when new construction is proposed.

5. After the Commission has given notice of the meeting at which an application for a certificate of approval will be considered, no other application for the same alteration or change of use may be submitted until the application is withdrawn or the Commission has approved or denied the existing application and all appeals have been concluded, except when an application is made for a certificate of approval for the preliminary design of a project, a later application may be made for a certificate of approval for a subsequent design phase or phases of the same project.

 . C. An applicant may make a written request to submit an application for a certificate of approval for a preliminary design of a project if the applicant waives in writing the deadline for a Commission decision on the subsequent design phase or phases of the project, and agrees in writing that the Commission decision on the preliminary design is immediately appealable by the applicant or any interested person of record. The staff may reject the request if it appears that approval of a preliminary design would not be an efficient use of staff or Commission time and resources, or would not further the goals and objectives of this Chapter. To be complete, an application for a certificate of approval for a preliminary design must include the information listed above in subsection B2, subparagraphs a through j, k1, k2, k3, k5, l, o and p. A certificate of approval that is granted for a preliminary design shall be conditioned upon subsequent submittal of the final design and all of the information listed above in subsection B2 and Commission approval prior to issuance of permits for work affecting a building, structure or other visible element.

~~C~~D. The Commission shall review and make recommendations regarding appropriateness of each proposed change or addition and a certificate of approval shall be issued by the Commission as provided in this chapter. The Commission, in considering the appropriateness of any alteration, demolition, new construction, reconstruction, restoration, remodeling, or other modification of any building or other structure in the Historic District, including structures to be located in public places, shall refer to the purpose of this chapter and shall consider among other things the historical and architectural value and significance, architectural style, the general design, arrangement, texture, material, occupancy and use, and color of the building or structure in question or its appurtenant fixtures, including signs, the relationship of such features to similar features of the other buildings within the Historical District and the position of such building or structure in relation to the street, public way, or semipublic way and to other buildings and structures. The Commission shall also make no recommendations or requirements except for the purpose of preventing developments inconsistent with the criteria of this chapter. Where modification of the appearance of a structure within the Historical District does not require a building or demolition permit, an application for a certificate of approval shall nonetheless be filed with the Commission.

 (( ~~D~~E. The Commission shall have sole responsibility for determining the appropriate location, design and use of signs and structures to be located on or above the surface of public places in the Historical District and the sole responsibility for licensing and determining the appropriate locations for performers as defined in Section 17.32.010 H1 of the Seattle Municipal Code, in the Historical District; provided, that property owned by the Pike Place Market Preservation and Development Authority shall not be considered a public place for the purposes of this subsection. The Commission shall establish guidelines for the use of public places in the District by performers, may assess reasonable permit fees, and may utilize the services of the Pike Place Market Preservation and Development Authority (PDA) or should the PDA decline to make its services available, may utilize the services of any other organization appropriate for implementation of performers licensing guidelines. It shall be unlawful for any performer to actively solicit donations by word of mouth, gestures, mechanical devices, second parties. It shall also be unlawful for any performer or other person to use any device for the reproduction or amplification of sound without the express written approval of the Commission secured in advance.

 Section 18. Subsection B of Section 25.24.080, which Section was last amended by Ordinance 118012, is further amended as follows:

 25.24.080 Appeal to Hearing Examiner.

If one or more appeals are filed regarding the other permits, then the appeal of the certificate of approval shall be consolidated with them and shall be heard according to the same timelines established for the other appeals, except that appeals to the State Shoreline Hearings Board shall proceed independently according to the timelines set by the state for such appeals and except that an appeal of a certificate of approval for a preliminary design or for a subsequent design phase may proceed according to 25.24.060 without being consolidated. If the related permit decisions would not be appealable, then the appeal of the certificate of approval decision shall proceed immediately after it is filed.
