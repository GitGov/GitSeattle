 AN ORDINANCE relating to the I-90 Home Ownership Plan, adopting amendments to such Plan with respect to Phase II tenants; authorizing the purchase from the State of Washington of certain improved real property pursuant to such Plan; directing the deposit of funds received from home buyers in the I-90 Home Ownership Account of the Low Income Housing Fund and appropriating such funds for payments to the State; amending Ordinance 116516; and ratifying and confirming prior acts; all by a three-fourths vote of the members of the City Council.

 WHEREAS, the City Council by Resolution No. 27901 passed the 28th day of August 1989, recognized the I-90 Area Development Policies as the basic City policy governing the sale and development of City-owned land in the project area; and

 WHEREAS, by Ordinance 115382, the City Council adopted the I-90 Home Ownership Plan and allocated funds appropriated by Ordinance 114376 to carry out the Plan; and

 WHEREAS, pursuant to Ordinance 116516, the City Council authorized the City to enter into a second land transfer agreement ("Phase II Agreement") to purchase additional surplus real property from the State of Washington, and further authorized issuance to the State of promissory notes of the City for the deferred portion of the purchase price of each improved parcel, the resale of improved parcels, and the making of rehabilitation loans to qualified purchasers of such parcels; and

 WHEREAS, the I-90 Home Ownership Plan stated that it was the City's intent to offer tenants of Phase II properties the same opportunities to remain in their residences as were offered to the tenants of the Phase I properties, but subject to the terms and conditions agreed to by the State and available financing assistance; and

 WHEREAS, amendments to the I-90 Home Ownership Plan were adopted October 1, 1996, by Ordinance 118352 to reflect the terms and conditions agreed to by the State in the Phase II Agreement and available financing assistance; and

 WHEREAS, Phase II properties occupied by remaining low-income tenants have been valued by the State at prices higher than previously anticipated, so that further amendment to the I-90 Home Ownership Plan is needed to accomplish the intent of the Plan; and

 WHEREAS, Ordinance 116516 requires further action by the City Council to authorize purchase of an improved parcel at a price exceeding the price set forth in Attachment C to that Ordinance; Now, Therefore,

 BE IT ORDAINED BY THE CITY OF SEATTLE AS FOLLOWS:

 Section 1. Paragraph (9) of the "GENERAL PROVISIONS" in Section XII of the I-90 Home Ownership Plan, as amended by Section 1 of Ordinance 118352, is hereby further amended as follows:

 (9) Deferred payment downpayment assistance loans will be available to qualified Phase II tenants with household incomes not exceeding eighty percent (80%) of median income, adjusted for household size, to finance a portion of the purchase price of the property. The amount of the loan shall be determined based on need, ~~but shall not exceed $40,000 or 40% of the~~~~price for the property established by the State under the terms of the Phase II Agreement, whichever is larger~~consistent with the limitations set forth in paragraph (10) below. The downpayment assistance loan shall take the form of a promissory note representing a portion of the deferred purchase price payable to the City, and shall replace a portion of the Acquisition Loan otherwise available, as described in Section V of the Plan. The provisions in such Section regarding minimum equity shall remain applicable. Loan term and interest rate shall be the same as specified for rehabilitation loans in this Plan.

 Section 2. The Director of Housing and Human Services ("Director") is hereby authorized, for and on behalf of the City, to purchase the property commonly known as 1535 22nd Avenue South, identified in the Phase II Agreement as No. 1-17-04796, and legally described as follows:

 Lots 8 and 9, Block 3, Creedmoor Addition to the City of Seattle, according to the plat recorded in Volume 11 of Plats, page 41, in King County, Washington

 (hereafter, the "Property"), for the sum of ONE HUNDRED FIFTEEN THOUSAND AND NO/100 DOLLARS ($115,000.00), which is the price determined by the State of Washington pursuant to the Phase II Agreement. The Director is authorized to approve minor corrections or revisions to the legal description of the Property and to accept a deed, which may contain such corrections or revisions to the legal description. The Director is authorized to execute and deliver, for and on behalf of the City, a promissory note of the City in substantially the form attached to Ordinance 116516 as Attachment D, in the amount of up to 95% of the purchase price. The authorization in this Section supersedes, with respect to the Property, the authorization in Section 3 of Ordinance 118352.

 Section 3. Funds previously appropriated for the I-90 Home Ownership Program, including funds received as repayment of loans made under the Program, may be used for payment to the State of a portion of the purchase price of the Property and any other Improved Parcels, as defined in the Phase II Agreement, acquired pursuant to Ordinance 116516, as amended. In each case the portion of the purchase price for which such funds may be used shall equal the amount of the downpayment assistance loan as provided in the I-90 Home Ownership Plan, as amended, plus any other portion of the purchase price not covered by the City's promissory note, and any costs of sale chargeable to the City. The authority in this Section is subject to any restrictions applicable to specific fund sources. Principal and interest received on each downpayment assistance loan shall be deposited in the fund and account from which the funds paid to the State under this Section for the respective Improved Parcel were derived, with appropriate proration if funds from more than one fund or account were used.

 Section 4. The Director is authorized, for and on behalf of the City, to sell and convey the Property to the tenant(s) thereof, and to provide rehabilitation financing, all on terms consistent with the I- 90 Home Ownership Plan, as amended by Ordinance 118352 and this ordinance. Except as otherwise provided in Ordinance 118352 or this ordinance, the provisions of Ordinance 116516 shall apply with respect to such sale and rehabilitation financing. Proceeds of sale, including principal and interest on acquisition loans and downpayment assistance loans, shall be deposited in the I-90 Home Ownership Account of the Low Income Housing Fund, except as otherwise stated in Section 3 of this ordinance. Such proceeds are hereby appropriated for payment to the State of Washington of amounts owing for the purchase of the Property and other property acquired from the State pursuant to the Phase II Agreement, and such appropriation shall carry forward from year to year unless expressly abandoned by ordinance. If the tenant occupying the Property remains eligible for City assistance under the I-90 Home Ownership Plan but cannot qualify financially to purchase the Property, the Director is authorized to offer and sell to such tenant, and assist the tenant with purchase of, any other available I-90 home of equal or lesser estimated after- rehabilitation value, pursuant to and consistent with authority previously granted by ordinance, as modified by the amendment to the I-90 Home Ownership Plan in this ordinance. If, following purchase of the Property by the City but prior to purchase of the Property by the tenant thereof, the tenant becomes ineligible for assistance, elects to purchase another I-90 home, otherwise elects not to purchase the Property, or fails to complete the purchase of the Property in a timely manner as determined by the Director, then the Director is hereby authorized to sell the Property to the highest bidder; provided that the Director shall not in any case cause the involuntary displacement of a tenant of the Property in good standing who qualifies for assistance under the I-90 Home Ownership Plan, and shall pursue any of the options allowable under the Plan, as amended, to permit such tenant to remain in the Property.

 Section 5. Section 5 of Ordinance 116516, as amended by Ordinance 118352, is hereby further amended as follows:

 Section 5. The Mayor or Director or their designees are hereby authorized, on behalf of the City, to sell and convey to authorized purchasers each of the Improved Parcels to be acquired from the State as set forth above, substantially on the terms described in the Plan, as amended by Ordinance 118352 and any other ordinances now or hereafter in effect~~the Ordinance amending this Section~~. Authorized purchasers of such properties shall be any persons whom the Director has determined are qualified in accordance with the terms of the Plan.

 Section 6. Section 9 of Ordinance 116516 is hereby amended and re- enacted as follows:

 Section 9. Downpayments received by the City from purchasers of properties sold under this Ordinance shall be applied directly to payment of downpayments to the State or shall be deposited in the~~I-90 Land Transfer~~~~Account~~~~of~~account established in the Low-Income Housing Fund pursuant to Section 5 of Ordinance 115882, which shall be called the "I-90 Home Ownership Account," to be used for the purpose of implementing the Plan. Any payments required to be repaid to the State Housing Trust Fund under agreement with the State, with respect to properties acquired by the City through use of State Housing Trust Fund monies for down payments, shall be deposited in the Low-Income Housing Fund and repaid to the State Housing Trust Fund. All necessary appropriations are hereby made and authorized for such repayments to the State Housing Trust Fund. Such appropriations shall carry forward from year to year unless expressly abandoned by ordinance.

 Section 7. Section 10 of Ordinance 116516 is hereby amended and re- enacted as follows:

 Section 10. Except as set forth in Section 9 above, funds received by the City from payments by purchasers of Improved Parcels, whether paid directly to the City or remitted by a loan servicer, shall be deposited in the I-90 ~~Land Transfer~~Home Ownership Account of the Low-Income Housing Fund to be used for the timely payment of amounts due on the City's promissory notes for both the Phase I and Phase II Improved Parcels. If the funds in the I-90 ~~Land Transfer~~Home Ownership Account are insufficient for such purpose, the balance shall come from other funds in the Low- Income Housing Fund. Any surplus in the I-90~~Land Transfer~~Home Ownership Account, after payment of all installments due on October 1 of any year for both the Phase I and Phase II Improved Parcels, may be transferred to the general Low-Income Housing Fund upon the direction of the Mayor or Director. All necessary appropriations are hereby made and authorized for timely payment of such amounts to the State. Such appropriations shall carry forward from year to year until expressly abandoned by ordinance.

 Section 8. The Director is authorized to execute, deliver, administer, perform, enforce and amend such documents and to perform such other acts, for and on behalf of the City, as may be necessary or appropriate to implement this ordinance and the I-90 Home Ownership Program as amended by Ordinance 118352 and this ordinance.

 Section 9. Any acts to carry out the activities described in this ordinance or the provisions of other ordinances amended hereby (as so amended), prior to the effective date of this ordinance and consistent with the terms hereof, are hereby ratified and confirmed.

 Section 10. The foregoing appropriations are made to meet actual necessary expenditures of the City for which insufficient appropriations have been made due to causes which could not reasonably have been foreseen at the time of the making of the 1998 Budget; Now, Therefore, in accordance with RCW 35.32A.060, by reason of the facts above stated this ordinance shall take effect and be in force thirty (30) days from and after its passage and approval, if approved by the Mayor, but if not approved and returned by the Mayor within ten (10) days after presentation, it shall take effect as provided by Municipal Code Section 1.04.020.
