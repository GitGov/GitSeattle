 Whereas, Council has determined that the purposes intended by the rezone proposed for Rezone Area III can be met through Land Use Code measures to be developed at a later time; and

 Whereas, Council has determined that the rezones proposed for Rezone Area IV should be reevaluated as part of Station Area Planning, with any decisions to be made only after appropriate public process and notice; and

 Whereas, certain areas of the North Beacon Hill Urban Village exhibit characteristics that warrant possible consideration of a wider array of rezone possibilities than now permitted by the Land Use Code,
