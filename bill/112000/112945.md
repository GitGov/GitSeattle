 AN ORDINANCE relating to Seattle Transportation; adopting a schedule of fees for the refilling and restoration of utility cuts and other openings in City streets, alleys, and other public places for construction or other activities; and authorizing the Director of Seattle Transportation to collect such fees in accordance with Seattle Municipal Code Chapter 15.26.

 WHEREAS, the City authorizes public and private utilities to work in City streets and rights-of-way to operate and maintain utility services, within the limitations established by State and Federal Law; and

 WHEREAS, Seattle Municipal Code Chapter 15.26.010 authorizes and directs the Director of Transportation, or as to park drives and boulevards, the Superintendent of Parks and Recreation, to prepare and recommend for adoption a schedule of fees to repay the City's costs of refilling and restoring any public place to its proper condition, after an excavation or other use has disturbed its surface; and

 WHEREAS, Resolution 29587 states the City's intent to review utility cut permit fees and rates paid by public and private utilities to determine if such fees and rates cover the full costs of restoring the street to its original condition; and

 WHEREAS, the street surface must be restored in accordance with the City's Street and Sidewalk Pavement Opening and Restoration Rules, after utility cuts; and

 WHEREAS, the Director of Seattle Transportation has prepared and recommended a Utility Restoration Fee Schedule with two sections: (1) standard utility repairs for cuts 18 square feet or less, charged by cut; (2) non-standard utility repairs for cuts greater than 18 square feet, including trench backfill, charged by square feet or ton; and

 WHEREAS, even when restoration standards are met, it is not always reasonably feasible to restore the paved surface to its condition prior to being cut and some loss of useful life occurs for some types of surfaces, and consequently the Utility Restoration Fee Schedule is intended to recover only the City's direct costs of restoring utility cuts;

 NOW THEREFORE,
