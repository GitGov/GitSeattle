 AN ORDINANCE relating to the City Light Department; authorizing the sale of Seattle's eight percent ownership share of the Centralia Coal Plant.

 WHEREAS, Resolution 29768, adopted by the City Council on June 8, 1998, and concurred in by the Mayor, endorsed a proposed sale of Seattle's ownership interest in the Centralia Coal Plant; and

 WHEREAS, Resolution 29768 authorized Seattle City Light to enter into an auction process with the seven other owners of the Centralia Coal Plant to effect the sale of the Plant; and

 WHEREAS, the eight owners of the Centralia Coal Plant did engage in an auction process which resulted in a bid for both the plant and the mine that met the requirements of the auction process; and

 WHEREAS, the buyer, TransAlta Corporation, headquartered in Calgary, Alberta, currently owns and operates two major coal mines and three coal-fired power plants, providing the experience to continue the Centralia Coal Plant as an efficient component of the West Coast power grid; and

 WHEREAS, TransAlta has made compliance with the requirements in SWAPCA's February 1998 RACT order, providing for emission control retrofits of the plant, a fundamental condition of the sale; and

 WHEREAS, TransAlta will accepted full responsibility for reclamation of the mine, including all past mining activities at the site, as well as any future mining activities; and

 WHEREAS, TransAlta intends to retain the employees at both the plant and the mine; and

 WHEREAS, after a public hearing before the Utilities and Environmental Management Committee, the Committee reviewed the proposed sale, together with City Light's report on the alternative energy supplies for City Light, as provided in Resolution 29768; and

 WHEREAS, the proceeds from the sale of the plant will allow Seattle to declare the Centralia Coal Plant surplus to the needs of City Light and will allow City Light the opportunity to develop effective, alternative energy supplies for the utility; NOW, THEREFORE,

 BE IT ORDAINED BY THE CITY OF SEATTLE AS FOLLOWS:

 Section 1. The Superintendent of the City Light Department is hereby authorized to execute on behalf of the City of Seattle any and all documents which may be necessary to sell Seattle's eight percent ownership interest in the Centralia Coal Plant to TransAlta, which will establish a Washington corporation or limited liability company for the purpose of owning and operating the plant, together with any ancillary ownership interests in appurtenances to the Plant.

 The Superintendent is instructed to work in concert with the other owners of the Plant to effect this transaction. Among the contracts which the Superintendent is expected to execute are: (1) Centralia Plant Purchase and Sale Agreement, which encompasses the comprehensive provisions of the sale of the plant to the Washington corporation or limited liability company formed by TransAlta, including requirements that the current owners maintain compliance with SWAPCA's RACT orders and proceed with scrubber installation at all times prior to the sale closing; (2) Guarantee Agreement, which provides a contractual guarantee running from TransAlta to the current Plant Owners that TransAlta Corporation, itself, will stand behind the assumption of reclamation liability of the Washington Corporation or limited liability company established by TransAlta to purchase and operate the mine; (3) Centralia 230 kV Transmission Facilities Purchase and Sale Agreement, which will sell Seattle's interest in the local transmission line running to the Plant to PacifiCorp, so that PacifiCorp can operate the transmission line to connect the Plant to the Western transmission grid; and (4)  Sellers Agreement, which provides an agreement between the current owners of the Plant to effect the sale and disburse proceeds upon closing. A copy of each of these proposed agreements is included within the Clerk's file for this ordinance.

 TransAlta Corporation has agreed to pay approximately $455 million for the Plant and $101 million for the Mine. The final amounts paid to Seattle and the other sellers will depend on final adjustments related to taxes, coal pile share reimbursements and a third party audit of the allocation of proceeds between the mine and the plant.

 Section 2. The proposed sale of Seattle's ownership interest in the Centralia Coal Plant, under the agreed upon terms with TransAlta, will provide sufficient resources for alternative energy sources, such that the Centralia Coal Plant is hereby declared surplus to the needs of City Light.

 Section 3. Upon closing of the sale of Seattle's ownership interest in the Centralia Coal Plant, the Superintendent is instructed to liquidate the trust fund that was established by Seattle to defray its contractual liability in the Fuel Supply Agreement with PacifiCorp for reclamation of the mine. TransAlta Corporation has agreed to take over all past and future reclamation liability, thereby relieving Seattle of its contractual obligation to PacifiCorp to help pay reclamation costs of the mine upon cancellation of the Fuel Supply Agreement. All funds realized from the liquidation of this reclamation trust shall be returned to the Light Fund.

 Section 4. Any acts taken in furtherance of the purpose of this ordinance, prior to its effective date, are hereby ratified and confirmed.

 Section 5. This ordinance shall take effect and be in force thirty (30) days from and after its approval by the Mayor, but if not approved and returned by the Mayor within ten (10) days after presentation, it shall take effect as provided by Municipal Code Section 1.04.020.
