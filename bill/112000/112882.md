 AN ORDINANCE relating to the 1990 Families and Education Levy; abandoning certain unspent appropriations from the Educational and Developmental Services Fund; reappropriating remaining levy funds for projects recommended by the Families and Education Levy Oversight Committee; and providing for the disposition after the end of 2000 of any unexpended levy proceeds.

 WHEREAS, the Families and Education Levy passed by voters in 1990 provided property tax revenues for a period of seven years from 1991 to 1997 for the purpose of providing Seattle School District public school students, Seattle youth, and their families with educational and developmental services, as set forth in Ordinance 115289; and

 WHEREAS, the activities funded by the levy were supplemental to the basic education financed by the State of Washington and provided programs and services such as early childhood development, school- based student and family services, student health services, out-of- school youth activities, and academic improvement activities; and

 WHEREAS, the renewed Families and Education Levy passed by voters in 1997 will provide property tax revenues from 1998 to 2004 to continue funding for a variety of supplemental educational and developmental services and programs aimed at keeping Seattle's children and youth safe, healthy, and ready to learn, as set forth in Ordinance 118557; and

 WHEREAS, interest earnings and unspent appropriations from the 1990 levy have been separately accounted for and equaled $326,011 at the end of 1998; and

 WHEREAS, the Families and Education Levy Oversight Committee has made recommendations regarding how these unspent levy funds can be reprogrammed, consistent with Ordinance 115289, to provide funding for priority one-time projects that will contribute to the effectiveness of ongoing levy programs or provide certain enhancements to existing programs or services;
