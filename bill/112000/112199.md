 AN ORDINANCE relating to the City Light Department, authorizing an easement agreement with Harold F. Albritton and Margaret A. Albritton, husband and wife, for use of a portion of the Beacon Hill Transmission Line Right of Way for ingress, egress and utilities (P.M.#240434-4- 305).

 WHEREAS, by Warranty Deed dated August 15, 1930, and recorded under King County Auditor's File No. 2623332, William Stevenson and Elizabeth Stevenson, husband and wife, conveyed to the City of Seattle title to a portion of Lot 4, Block 2, Dunlap's Half Acre Tracts, King County, Washington, as recorded in Volume 11 of Plats, page 78, records of King County Washington.

 WHEREAS, under said August 15, 1930 conveyance, William Stevenson and Elizabeth Stevenson, husband and wife, neglected to reserve an easement over and across the land conveyed, thereby leaving said land with no access to the public street called Spear Place South; and,

 WHEREAS, Harold F. Albritton and Margaret A. Albritton, husband and wife, are the current owners of said land with no access to Spear Place South; and,

 WHEREAS, Harold F. Albritton and Margaret A. Albritton, husband and wife, have requested that the City grant them an easement across the City's property for ingress, egress and utilities to Spear Place South; and,

 WHEREAS, the City Light Department has reviewed the easement request and has determined that, because an improved road already exists at the requested easement location, an easement for ingress, egress and utilities over and across the City's property will not present a hazard to or interfere with the construction, operation, maintenance, patrol and repair of the Beacon Hill Transmission Line Right-of-Way; Now, Therefore,
