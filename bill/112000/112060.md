 Section 1. Subject to terms and conditions of this ordinance, permission is hereby granted to GATX Terminals Corporation, a Delaware Corporation, its successors and assigns ("Permittee") to maintain and operate a petroleum pipeline system in, along, under and across 11th Avenue Southwest, approximately between 400 feet and 800 feet north of Southwest Lander Street, to be used for the conveying petroleum and petroleum products; together with water, air, vacuum, fuel, gas, telephone, power, steam and steam condensate return lines, and electrical signaling or remote electrical control lines. Said petroleum pipeline system encumbers approximately 13,475 square feet of 11th Avenue Southwest.

 Section 2. The permission herein granted to the Permittee, its successors and assigns shall be for a term of ten (10) years, commencing January 2, 1997 and terminating at 11:59 p.m. on January 1, 2007; provided, however, that upon written application of the Permittee at least thirty (30) days before expiration of the term, the City Council may, by resolution, renew the permit for two (2) successive ten (10) year terms, provided further that the total term of the permission as originally granted and thus extended shall not exceed thirty (30) years, subject to the right of The City of Seattle ("City") by ordinance to then revise any of the terms and conditions contained herein.

 Section 3. The permit granted hereby is subject to primary and secondary use by the public for travel and utility purposes, and the City expressly reserves the right to require the Permittee to remove the pipeline system or any portion thereof at Permittee's sole cost and expense in the event that:

 (a) The City Council determines, by ordinance, that the space occupied by the pipeline system is necessary for any primary or secondary public use or benefit, or that the pipeline system interferes with any primary or secondary public use or benefit; or

 (b) The Director of Transportation ("Director") determines that any term or condition of this ordinance has been violated, and such violation is not corrected by the Permittee within thirty (30) days of written notification from the City.

 A City Council determination that the space is necessary for a primary or secondary public use or benefit shall be conclusive and final.

 Section 4. In the event that the permit is not renewed, or the permission hereby granted extends to its termination in thirty (30) years, or the City orders removal of the pipeline system pursuant to the terms of this ordinance, then within ninety (90) days after such expiration, termination or order of removal, or prior to the date stated in an "Order to Remove", as the case may be, the Permittee shall remove the pipeline system and shall place all portions of the street that may have been disturbed , in as good condition for public use as they were prior to construction, and in at least as good condition in all respects as the abutting portions thereof. Whereupon the Director shall issue a certificate discharging the Permittee from responsibility under this ordinance for occurrences after the date of such discharge.

 Section 5. The Permittee shall not commence reconstruction, relocation, readjustment or repair of the pipeline system except under the supervision of, and in strict accordance with plans and specifications approved by the Director.

 (c) the Director certifies that the Permittee has discharged its obligation herein. Provided, that upon prior notice to the Permittee and entry of written findings that such is in the public interest, the Director may, in his/her sole discretion, excuse the Permittee, conditionally or absolutely, from compliance with all or any of the Permittee's obligations to remove the pipeline system and its property and restore disturbed areas.

 Section 7. The pipeline system shall remain the exclusive responsibility of the Permittee. The Permittee, by acceptance of this ordinance and the permission hereby granted, does release the City from any and all claims resulting from damage or loss to Permittee's own property, and does covenant and agree for itself, its successors and assigns, with The City of Seattle, to at all times protect and save harmless The City of Seattle from all claims, actions, suits, liability, loss, costs, expense or damages of every kind and description (excepting only such damages that may result from the sole negligence of the City), which may accrue to, or be suffered by, any person or persons and/or property or properties, including without limitation, damage or injury to the Permittee, its officers, agents, employees, contractors, invitees, tenants and tenants' invitees, licensees or their successors and assigns, or to any member ot the public irrespective of their status, by reason of the maintenance, operation or use of said pipeline system or the occupation or use of said City street, or any portion thereof, or by reason of anything that has been done, or may at any time be done, by the Permittee, its successors or assigns, by reason of this ordinance, or by reason of the Permittee, its successors or assigns, failing or refusing to strictly comply with each and every provision of this ordinance; and if any such suit, action or claim be filed, instituted or begun against the City, the Permittee its successors or assigns, shall, upon notice thereof from the City, defend the same at its or their sole cost and expense, and in case judgment shall be rendered against the City in any suit or action, the Permittee, its successors or assigns, shall fully satisfy said judgment within ninety (90) days after such action or suit shall have been finally determined, if determined adversely to the City.
