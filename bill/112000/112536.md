 AN ORDINANCE relating to land use and zoning, establishing a moratorium on the acceptance of applications for use permits or construction permits for seaplane operations or facilities in the "Downtown Harborfront 1" and "Downtown Harborfront 2" zones, establishing a permit termination date for permits issued for such uses for which applications were submitted before January 1, 1999, and declaring an emergency requiring a 3/4 vote of the Seattle City Council so that the Ordinance may take effect immediately.

 BE IT ORDAINED BY THE CITY OF SEATTLE AS FOLLOWS:

 Section 1. The City Council hereby makes the following legislative findings of fact and declarations:

 1. The City has received proposals and inquiries from persons wishing to provide sight-seeing flights for tourists from Seattle's central waterfront on Elliott Bay. In order to do so, the proponents would construct seaplane facilities and conduct seaplane operations at the central waterfront.

 2. The City's current land use and other ordinances may allow the establishment of such a use.

 3. In response to these proposals, the City has received comments from citizens, organizations, and governmental agencies expressing concerns about the wisdom of allowing seaplane operations along the central waterfront. These concerns include issues of public safety, resulting from the potentially hazardous congestion of vessels and seaplanes in the area, and public health and welfare, resulting from the noise of seaplanes taking off and landing. Concern exists regarding potential cumulative adverse impacts from several seaplane operations, as well as the general appropriateness of such a use along the central waterfront.

 4. In order to respond to these concerns, the City Council would like to thoughtfully consider whether the Seattle central waterfront is an appropriate location for seaplane operations and facilities. The City Council believes that it will require approximately ten months to gather information related to these issues, to analyze the information and issues, to prepare proposed legislation, if any, to obtain public review and comment, to conduct environmental review, and to comply with other legal requirements.

 5. If proposals to establish permanent seaplane operations or facilities become legally vested before the City Council has completed its review of these issues, the Council's work and ultimate legislative decision may be rendered meaningless, and uses may be permanently established which are inimical to the public health, safety and welfare. Because the acquisition of vested rights may be imminent, an emergency exists which requires the adoption of this moratorium ordinance.

 6. Because one proponent has submitted a MUP application, the City Council has an opportunity to evaluate the actual impacts of a proposed seaplane operation, in the event the permit is issued and the proponent begins operations. This information will be very useful in deciding whether such uses are appropriate to the waterfront. By limiting the duration of such a permit, permanent adverse effects may be avoided if it is determined that problems exist. On the other hand, if the demonstration period reveals an absence of problems, the City Council may decide to allow such permits to be renewed or to authorize the general and permanent location of such uses along the waterfront.

 7. Therefore in order for the City Council to fulfill its fundamental responsibility to address constituent concerns and to protect and promote the public health, safety and welfare, it is necessary to temporarily prohibit the general acquisition of vested rights to establish seaplane operations or facilities along Seattle's central waterfront.

 8. The City has legal authority to establish a temporary, permit moratorium pursuant to the authority granted by Article 11, Section 11 of the Washington Constitution, the Growth Management Act, RCW 36.70A.390, and Matson v.Clark County, 79 Wn. App. 641 (1995).

 Section 2. Through November 1, 1999 or until new land use regulations governing the location of "water-based airports" take effect, whichever is sooner, no use permit application or construction permit application may be accepted for any "airport, water-based", as defined in SMC 23.84.038, proposed to be located within the "Downtown Harborfront 1" or "Downtown Harborfront 2" zones. This prohibition does not apply to any proposed use for which a Master Use Permit application was submitted to the City before January 1, 1999. If such an application has been submitted but a permit has not been issued as of the date of this ordinance, and the application is later approved, the permit which is issued shall expire on November 1, 1999. However, if the decision to issue the permit is the subject of an administrative or judicial appeal, then the permit shall expire as follows:

 A. If a final appellate decision which allows the granting of the permit is issued between June 1 and September 1 of any year, or on June 1 or September 1, then the permit shall expire on November 1 of the following year. For example, if the decision is issued on July 15, 1999, the permit will expire on November 1, 2000. The purpose of this timing is to allow seaplane operations for the duration of the summer tourist season to be able to evaluate impacts of the use.

 B. If a final appellate decision which allows the granting of the permit is issued after September 1 of any year and before June 1 of the following year, the permit will expire on November 1 of the following year.

 If a permit expires as described above, the holder of the permit may re-apply for a permit under the terms of the ordinance in effect at the time of application in the same manner as any other permit applicant.

 Section 3. The City Council approves the "Work Program for Central Waterfront Seaplane Analysis" which is attached as Attachment 1 to this ordinance, and requests that the Department of Design, Construction and Land Use report periodically to the Council's Business, Economic and Community Development Committee regarding work program progress prior to the November 1, 1999 deadline. City Council staff shall schedule a public hearing on this ordinance as required by RCW 36.70A.390.

 Section 4. This ordinance shall become effective immediately upon the approval or signing of the ordinance by the Mayor or passage over his veto, as provided by the Charter of the City.

 Attachment 1

 Work Program for Central Waterfront Seaplane Analysis

 The Department of Design, Construction, and Land Use (DCLU) will undertake the following work program to support the City Council's enactment of Ordinance 119328 (C.B. 112536, which establishes a moratorium on seaplane operations on Elliott Bay through November 1, 1999, while allowing entities with existing applications to proceed to obtain permits and operate temporarily.

 Review existing City and other goals, policies, and regulations in the Comprehensive Plan, Downtown Plan, new neighborhood plans, Shoreline Master Program, etc. that may apply to the downtown waterfront area.

 Gather data both on Seattle's experience with seaplane operations at Lake Union, and on seaplane operations of other cities in Washington and in other states, including the following:

 Number of seaplane facilities in various cities of various populations;

 Numbers and times of day of take-offs and landings at seaplane facilities;

 Impacts, if any, on marine traffic;

 Noise levels associated with seaplane operations;

 Noise complaints from citizens, businesses, etc. due to seaplane operations.

 Gather data (as available) on vessel traffic on Elliott Bay, including statistics on accidents and near-accidents.

 Analyze the actual impacts of temporarily allowing seaplane operations on Elliott Bay, focusing in particular on safety issues, noise impacts to waterfront and other area residents and to congestion impacts on marine vessel traffic.

 Analyze methods to mitigate negative impacts, if any, of seaplane operations on Elliott Bay.

 Hold one or more community meetings or workshops to invite public comment on issues related to seaplane operations on Elliott Bay.

 Develop options for addressing the issue of seaplane operations on Elliott Bay, which could include possible conditions on such operations, or possible Land Use Code amendments restricting the extent to which seaplanes would be allowed to operate on Elliott Bay, including possible increase in City staffing to monitor and administer any changes.

 Conduct any required SEPA review on option(s) to be submitted to the City Council.

 Prepare report and any accompanying proposed legislation to be submitted to the City Council for consideration, public comment, and possible action.
