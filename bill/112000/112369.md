 AN ORDINANCE relating to the City Hall Subfund, increasing the 1998 appropriation from the City Hall Subfund by a three-fourths vote of the City Council.

 WHEREAS, pursuant to Ordinance 118081, all revenues from Key Tower are to be deposited into, and all expenses of Key Tower are to be paid from, the City Hall Subfund created by that ordinance; and

 WHEREAS, because Key Tower has reached nearly full occupancy, both revenues and expenses are greater than were estimated in preparation of the 1998 Budget; and

 WHEREAS, certain improvements to the heating, ventilation and cooling system were contemplated at the time of the City's purchase of Key Tower; and

 WHEREAS, greater Key Tower occupancy and increased heating loads have resulted in an immediate need for an additional cooling tower; and

 WHEREAS, Ordinance 118081 appropriated funds for the design of access improvements to Key Tower, which design work will not begin until after a decision on long term ownership of Key Tower has been made; and

 WHEREAS, a recently-completed study recommends making ADA improvements to building entries to address current accessibility barriers for the public, City Light employees now occupying the building, and other City employees visiting Key Tower; and

 WHEREAS, implementing those ADA improvements would benefit the public and City employees, whether or not the City sells Key Tower; and

 WHEREAS, it is the City's intent to lease the 62nd floor, which is currently shell and core space only and will require substantial tenant improvements; and

 WHEREAS, these expenditures will be necessary whether the City retains or sells Key Tower; and

 WHEREAS, sufficient revenues are available from 1998 Key Tower revenues to cover the additional appropriation;

 NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT ORDAINED BY THE CITY OF SEATTLE AS FOLLOWS:

 Section 1. The expenditure allowance in the 1998 Budget for the City Hall Subfund of the General Fund is hereby increased by the sum of Two Million Eight Hundred Seventy Thousand Five Hundred Dollars ($2,870,500) by the appropriation, hereby made and authorized, of a like amount from unencumbered and unexpended balances in the City Hall Subfund of the General Fund. Any part of this appropriation remaining unexpended and unencumbered at the end of 1998 shall carry forward from year to year until fully expended.

 Section 2. Any act consistent with the authority and prior to the effective date of this ordinance is hereby ratified and confirmed.

 Section 3. The foregoing appropriations are made to meet actual necessary expenditures of the City for which insufficient appropriations have been made due to causes which could not reasonably have been foreseen at the time of the adoption of the 1998 Budget; Now, Therefore, in accordance with RCW 35.32A.060, by reason of the facts above stated this ordinance shall take effect and be in force thirty (30) days from and after its passage and approval, if approved by the Mayor, but if not approved and returned by the Mayor within ten (10) days after presentation, it shall take effect as provided by Municipal Code Section 1.04.020.

 PASSED by a three-fourths (3/4) vote of all the members of the City Council the ____ day of ____________ , 1998, and signed by me in open session in authentication of its passage this ____ day of _____________, 1998. _______________________ President of the City Council
