 AN ORDINANCE relating to the Water Department; creating a new residential sub-classification for master metered residential developments with mains of six inches or greater; increasing all outside city rates to account for changes in King County franchise requirements; and amending Seattle Municipal Code section 21.04.440.

 WHEREAS, a consultant study performed on master meter residential use performed at the suggestion of the Water Department suggests that the administrative and operation and maintenance costs of serving large, master metered residential developments are generally lower than individually metered residences; and

 WHEREAS, the consumption characteristics of a master metered residential development parallel or exceed the summer peaking profile of other residential developments; and

 WHEREAS, it therefore appears appropriate to account for savings in administrative and operation and maintenance costs of such master metered developments, but to do so in the off peak period; and

 WHEREAS, such treatment of cost savings is best set forth in a new subclassification of residential customers; and

 WHEREAS, King County Ordinance No. 11278, approved by the County Executive on April 14, 1994, imposes new requirements on the Water Department to locate and repair "spaghetti lines" in county road rights-of-way which will increase the costs of serving customers outside the City, NOW THEREFORE,

 E. Wholesale Customers-Demand Charge. In addition to the foregoing, each municipal water district, other municipality, and nonprofit water association being served prior to January 1, 1970, shall be subject to a demand charge based on effective deficient water storage, as determined by the peak instantaneous flow rate, and the equivalent financing costs to provide storage. The proceeds from this demand charge, together with any interest earnings thereon, shall be deposited in the Water Fund. The amount of the proceeds shall be recorded in a separate account and shall be recognized in cost allocation studies as a credit to te total revenue to be recovered from wholesale customers through any wholesale rates on consumption in excess of base period amounts . Such demand charge and method of application thereof shall be as follows: 1. The policy of the Seattle Water Department is to supply water to wholesale water purveyor customers (municipal water districts, other municipalities, and nonprofit water associations)at the twenty-four (24) hour average flow rate. Water purveyors are expected to provide or pay for storage for peaking rates above such average flow rate. 2. A demand charge will be applicable to water purveyors who are found to have deficient storage as determined in the following paragraphs. 3. The water services (master meters) to purveyors will be monitored by the Water Department to determine applicability of the demand charge. Demand metering equipment will be installed on master meters to purveyors at Water Department expense. 4. Water services to a purveyor on a uniform segment of supply line may be considered as one (1) water service in calculating storage deficiency. 5. A "day" for purposes of this schedule commences at nine (9:00) a.m. and ends at nine (9:00) a.m. the following calendar day. 6. The demand factor for each water service is determined by dividing the fifteen (15) minute peak flow rate by the twenty-four (24) hour average flow rate of the same day. 7. The ten (10) maximum flow days for each water service will be used to determine the average demand factor from which storage deficiency will be calculated. The average demand factor is the average of the demand factors of the ten (10) maximum flow days for each water service. 8. A demand charge for each water service shall be applied only when the average demand factor exceeds 1.3.

 9. The deficient storage volume of each water service for demand charge calculation rate shall be S = 0.22(F-1)Q: where S = storage deficiency in gallons, F = average demand factor and Q = average daily quantity of water in gallons used in the ten (10) maximum flow days for each water service. 10. As of January 1, 1993, the demand charge shall be calculated by applying a storage deficiency rate of Eighteen Dollars and Seventy-five Cents ($18.75) per month per thousand gallons of deficient storage. The total purveyor demand charge shall be the sum of the demand charges for each water service. 11. The demand charge will be calculated in the fall of each year based upon evaluation of the summer months (June, July and August) water delivery flow rates and upon the storage deficiency rate in effect at the time that those flows occurred. The monthly storage deficiency demand charge billing shall commence in January at which time a new charge, if any, shall be applied. 12. Peak flow rates through master meters will be monitored during the summer months; however, if peak flow rates create adverse hydraulic conditions, demand metering may be applied year-round, after reasonable notice to purveyor customers. 13. Purveyors may use other sources of supply approved by the Superintendent of Water such as interconnection with other purveyors' systems or wells for summer water supply peaking purposes. 14. If purveyors formulate approved cooperative operating agreements, their services on uniform segments of supply line may be considered as one (1) service in determining demand charge. 15. Peak flows caused by major accidents in a purveyor's water system will be excluded in determining the demand charge. Peak flows caused by other unusual situations may also be excluded at the discretion of the Superintendent of Water. Documentation of such incidents shall be provided by purveyors to the Superintendent of Water within thirty (30) days after an accident. 16. Artificially created daily flow rates which differ substantially from customers' daily consumption may be disallowed in calculating the demand charge. 17. Approved electrical sensing circuits (e.g., for telemetering) from City master meters may be made available to purveyors on a reimbursable-cost basis. Such circuits shall be installed and maintained by the City; there will be no need for purveyors' representatives to enter City chambers. 18. The demand charge for a certain master meter(s) may be excused if lower pressure water (or gravity-flow water) replaces City-pumped water (or higher flow water), provided that the peak flow rate through this service does not exceed the demand rate threshold which would occur without the replacement of water service flow. 19. In case of malfunction of metering equipment, the Water Department shall estimate the charge, if any, from best available data. Section 3. Any act pursuant to the authority and prior to the effective date of this ordinance is hereby ratified and confirmed. Section 4. This ordinance shall take effect and be in force thirty days from and after its passage and approval, if approved by the Mayor; otherwise it shall take effect at the time it shall become a law under the provisions of the city charter. Passed by the City Council the _____ day of ____________, 1994, and signed by me in open session in authentication of its passage this _____ day of _________________, 1994.
