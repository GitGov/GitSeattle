 WHEREAS, pursuant to Ordinance 117624, the City of Seattle authorized the Superintendent of Seattle City Light, with the concurrence of the Director of Finance and the Director of the Office of Management and Planning (the "Review Panel"), to request proposals for the acquisition of a telephone system and related services for use by City Light at Key Tower; and

 WHEREAS, the Superintendent and the Review Panel have unanimously concluded that the proposer whose proposal is the most advantageous for the City of Seattle is the Department of Administrative Services; and
