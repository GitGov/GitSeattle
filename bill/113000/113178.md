Two story window bays are recessed and framed by the entablature, squared concrete columns and a poured concrete foundation course. Each window bay consists of paired three-light windows stacked above paired four light windows. A cast coffer-like panel separates the stacked windows. Current windows are aluminum replacements installed in 1989 (prior to historic evaluation). They are similar in detailing and operation to the original steel ones, with slightly wider sashes. A flat built up roof encloses the office space. Four-light clerestory windows on side walls and massive concrete end walls incorporating roof vents support the gabled drill hall roof. The west entryway is flanked by eight window bays on each side. The two story entry alcove projects out slightly from the main famayade supported by two squared concrete columns, while the actual doorway is slightly recessed. There is a recessed window sized opening faced in wood on either side of the entry doors. There is a stairway projection trimmed with gold stars on each side. The north doorway is a simplified version of the main entry. The entry alcove projection contains three small horizontally oriented windows. It has stairway projections identical to the west entry. The roofline steps back to the fourth floor, which provides inclusive views of Lake Union from rooms on this level. The center entry on the south side contains a single glass and metal door flanked by a 3-light transom. The entry at the south end of the east side serves a loading dock, has a metal rolling door and is not a contributing feature.

 The drill hall is the centerpiece of the facility with its exposed steel trusses (currently partially concealed by suspended acoustical tile ceiling) and large interior undivided space. The drill hall floor is unique, consisting of 2x4 wood studs cut into approximately 21/2-inch length and installed end to end into a metal track resting on a mastic covered concrete slab.

 There is a two-chamber damage control wet trainer located on the northeast wall. A second level balcony with a metal railing surrounds the dill hall area. The ward room located in the northeast corner of the second floor contains a roman brick fireplace built into a curved wood wall unit and a wood parquet floor, wood base boards and original doors. The former indoor rifle range area, located south of the wardroom down to room 215, retains its hinged steel window guards. The ship bridge simulation space on the fourth level at the north end is a contributing building feature. Additional contributing details include two service windows on either side of Room 223 and glazed wall tile and glass block inserts in three men's restrooms (rooms 143,219, 237). P: P:
