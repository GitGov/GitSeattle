 ORDINANCE _____________

 AN ORDINANCE relating to public restrooms; directing Seattle Public Utilities to enter into a contract for the lease, installation and maintenance of five automatic public restrooms and directing the Executive Department to report on alternative means of increasing public access to restroom and toilet facilities in Seattle's downtown and urban centers.

 WHEREAS, there is a recognized need for additional public restroom and toilet facilities in Seattle's downtown and urban centers;

 WHEREAS, over the past several years City staff have explored a number of means by which increased access to such facilities can be provided to the general public; and

 WHEREAS, the need for increased access to public restroom and toilet facilities may be addressed through the installation of automatic public restrooms as well as non-automatic portable toilets and the securing of rights to public use of restrooms in private business facilities, among other means; and

 WHEREAS, the City Council, through a Statement of Legislative Intent adopted in connection with the 2000 Budget process, directed Seattle Public Utilities to develop a Request for Proposals, a siting plan, and cost estimates for up to ten self-cleaning public restrooms; and

 WHEREAS, Seattle Public Utilities has worked with many community, neighborhood and business groups to find appropriate sites for the installation of the automatic public restrooms and has identified five final sites; and

 WHEREAS, Seattle Public Utilities issued a Request for Proposals for five automatic public restrooms in March, 2001 and received a responsive proposal from vendors with excellent references that should be accepted under conditions specified herein; and

 WHEREAS, the City Council desires information about other methods for funding public restrooms including but not limited to programs using advertising as consideration for the private installation and operation of automatic public restrooms and the apparent success or failure of those methods and their comparative costs; NOW THEREFORE,

 BE IT ORDAINED BY THE CITY OF SEATTLE AS FOLLOWS:

 Section 1. Seattle Public Utilities is directed to negotiate and enter into a contract for the lease, installation, and maintenance of five automatic public restrooms substantially as proposed by Hering Bau and Northwest Cascade, Inc. in response to the City's March 2001 Request for Proposals for Automatic Public Toilets but conditioned upon the maintenance/service provider's performance of additional daily services at the City's request until otherwise directed by the City.

 Section 2. The City's Executive Department shall continue to explore alternative means of increasing access to restroom facilities for the general public including securing the installation of additional automatic public restrooms in return for opportunities for increased and commercial advertising, installing additional portable toilets, providing additional informational signage regarding existing restrooms and toilets available for use by the general public, and securing public access rights to restrooms on private property. Toward this end, the Executive is directed to report to the City Council on alternatives for funding of additional publicly accessible toilets by no later than March 31, 2002. When implementing any of the proposed alternatives, the Executive Department shall require that comprehensive outreach measures be undertaken in order to maximize the number of vendors and service providers that make submissions in response to announcements of the City's intent to procure such facilities and services.

 Section 3. This ordinance shall take effect and be in force thirty (30) days from and after its approval by the Mayor, but if not approved and returned by the Mayor within ten (10) days after presentation, it shall take effect as provided by Municipal Code Section 1.04.020.
