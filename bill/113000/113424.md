 SPU Response

 Page 1-2 Section 1.2

 City of Redmond

 The last sentence of Section 1.2 states that a more detailed history is available in the 1993 WSP. We understood that the new WSP was a stand-alone document and did not refer to previous WSPs. Is the history that long that it cannot be included in the new WSP?

 Comment reviewed; no revision made.

 The history of SPU was intended to be brief. The reference was to allow readers the option of additional information.

 The maps indicate an "indirect service area" south of Issaquah and outside of its service area. Indirect wholesale water supply to this area is not currently provided. Also, the service areas of several utilities are incorrectly depicted (e.g., a service area west of Mirrormont and east of King County Water District 90 is identified when none exists; Issaquah's service area is shown to be much larger than it is).

 Draft maps revised.

 It is King County's understanding that the Instream Flow Agreement related to Seattle's Habitat Conservation Plan (HCP) has been legally challenged. Please include a brief summary of current developments with regard to this matter.

 Draft text revised.

 See Table 2

 Item #8

 Page 1-15

 UTRC

 Ongoing contract negotiations are also an excellent opportunity for SPU to pursue regional conservation goals and rate structures. Please describe SPU's goals regarding conservation and rate structures in the discussions that are occurring.

 Draft text revised.

 See Table 2

 Item #9

 The revision indicates that these issues are being discussed. Contract negotiations are too dynamic to include specifics.

 Page 1-15; fourth paragraph

 BUD

 The draft plan notes SPU has entered into active negotiations with its current purveyors, as well as with other potential purveyors, to develop new long-term contracts. However, the plan should also note that the current contract responsibilities for such elements as long-term supply planning might change as a result of the negotiations. The changes may warrant revisions to this Water System Plan Update.

 Draft text revised.

 See Table 2

 Item #10

 Page 2-5;

 Table 2-2

 BUD

 Table 2-2 shows non-revenue water lower than what it is currently and at a significantly lower percentage than for the retail part of the system. It should probably be higher than it is shown.

 Draft text revised.

 See Table 2

 Item # 13, Item #15 and Item #16

 UTRC

 Discuss the improvements that were made to the water system that reduced non-revenue water by 50 percent.

 Draft text revised.

 See Table 2

 Item #12

 Page 2-3

 UTRC

 Table 2-1 does not accurately reflect the amount of water unaccounted for by SPU. Please modify the table to show the desired information (i.e., how much unaccounted-for water is in SPU's direct service area) as follows:

 [Total diversion from source]-[metered water to wholesale customers] = SPU direct service area water.

 [SPU direct service area water]-[metered sales of water in SPU direct service area] = un-metered water.

 While some of the un-metered water may be accounted for (e.g., estimates of fire department use), most of the un-metered water is probably due to leaks.

 Comment reviewed; no revision made.

 Table 2-1 provides as much information as available: total water diversions, total billed consumption, and SPU's non-revenue water. SPU's non-revenue water includes distribution and transmission non- revenue water for the direct service area plus purveyor transmission non-revenue water. SPU does not have data that allows the separation of purveyor transmission non-revenue water from direct service non-revenue water. SPU does make assumptions in the forecast model about how much non-revenue water is associated with transmission losses to purveyors. However, SPU has no historical data that allows it to be separated out and therefore should not appear in a table of water system statistics.

 Refer to associated revisions

 See Table 2

 Item # 13, Item #15 and Item #16

 Page 2-6

 UTRC

 Water use of the new and potential customers shown in Table 2-3 should also be affected by the conservation scenarios. Modify the table to show a declining trend in new and potential customer water use or explain why conservation scenarios would not apply to this user group.

 Comment reviewed; no revision made.

 Demand for Seattle and its current wholesale customers has been forecast using SPU's demand model and what is known about past, present, and future conservation including the impact of the 1% program. However, SPU does not have a model to forecast the demand of new/potential wholesale customers and little information is available about their past and planned conservation. SPU projected wholesale demand from Seattle by taking wholesale customer forecasts of their own demand and subtracting the amount of water supplied from their own sources. SPU does not know what wholesale customers have assumed about conservation in their forecasts and have no basis for developing conservation scenarios for them. For the WSP, SPU has taken wholesaler provided demand forecasts at face value. It is quite possible that they have much potential for reducing their demand through conservation and that their actual demand from Seattle will turn out to be less than what has been projected.

 Refer to associated revision

 See Table 2

 Item #17

 UTRC

 Extrapolate conservation scenario curves 1, 2, and 3 and report the year in which those curves cross the firm yield curve.

 Draft text revised and table added.

 See Table 2

 Item #11 and Item #18

 Section 2

 BUD

 It should be noted in the WSP that Purveyors have not committed to the full 10 year 1% Conservation Plan, which has been assumed in all scenario forecasts.

 Because Bellevue's and SPU's population forecasts are based on PSRC forecasts, we are assuming SPU's demand forecasts are consistent with those provided annually by Bellevue, except for local vs. regional conservation assumptions. If this is not the case please contact us as soon as possible to resolve or explain any discrepancy.

 Draft text revised.

 See Table 2

 Item #31

 SPU recognizes that purveyors have generally committed to the 1% Conservation Program and that the vote to approve funding for only two years was to allow for further development and implementation of the plan so it could be adaptive to other efforts in the region.

 Also, SPU's forecast of Bellevue's demand is consistent with that provided annually by Bellevue. See related response to comment noted on page 2-6.

 City of Redmond

 Table 3-3 lists the rated capacity of the Highline Wellfield

 facilities. The three pumps listed total 6,200 gpm, which equates to 8.9 MGD, the text states the total capacity as 10 MGD. What happened to the remaining 1.1 MGD?

 The TESSL and CRPL #4 capital needs identified in the study do not appear to be reflected in the planned improvements. Please discuss why this is the case.

 Draft text revised.

 See Table 2

 Item #21 and Item #22

 Pages 3-31 and 3-32

 UTRC

 The data indicate that 49 percent of SPU's small meters are beyond their reliable life, yet the plan proposes to replace small meters on an average of only once every 15 to 20 years. This replacement proposal ensures that on average approximately 50 percent of SPU's small meters will be beyond their reliable life. Please explain this strategy.

 Draft text revised.

 See Table 2

 Item #25

 Page 3-32

 UTRC

 The plan identifies two efforts to characterize and model the existing pipe network. While these efforts are encouraging, many large utilities are already using hydraulic models and distribution system information to prioritize capital improvements. How does SPU prioritize water main and appurtenance improvements without these data? Does SPU have any data concerning its pipe network (by size, material, lineal feet, and age) or existing hydraulic problem areas (e.g., areas of low fire flows or low pressure)? Please include any relevant pipe network information that currently exists.

 Conservation Program General Comment #1

 WEC

 If we are to meet the needs of both people and fish through the next twenty years, we must find ways to continue to have our conservation rates exceed the rate of growth.

 Comment noted. Partial revision made.

 See Table 2

 Item #14

 Text revision reflects the impact of conservation over the next ten years. The text in the WSP already reflects the impact of the different conservation scenarios after 2010.

 Section 4 -

 Conservation Program General Comment #2

 WEC

 The (new wholesale) contracts should be written to assure that Seattle's retail customers' conservation efforts indeed result in greater environmental protection and that its wholesale customers are committed to achieve equivalent performance... The targets they are expected to reach should not be vague.

 Comment noted. See related comment. Table 2

 Item #9

 While conservation is one of the topics in the new contract negotiations, details of the new wholesale contracts have not been finalized. Furthermore, contract negotiations are too dynamic to include specifics in a long-range planning document.

 Section 4 -

 Conservation Program General Comment #3

 WEC

 It would seem appropriate through wholesale contracts to back up the cooperative development of strategies and commitment to curtailment to the mandatory stage-not wait for the emergency stage.

 Comment noted.

 See immediately preceding note on contract negotiations.

 Section 4- Conservation Program

 General Comment #4

 WEC

 Use of this strategy (conservation rates) applied to both retail and wholesale use is an important component of a conservation plan, particularly to reduce peak demand. The program for replacement and repair, as well as the utilization of data loggers for demand metering are an essential part of the investment necessary to carry out the conservation program.

 Comment reviewed, partial revision made.

 See Table 2

 Item #24

 Section 4- Conservation Program General Comment #5

 WEC

 Seattle should insist that purveyors provide full service metering so that they gather and provide the information necessary to make their conservation efforts effective.

 Comment reviewed; no revision made.

 See preceding note concerning contract negotiations.

 Sections 4- Conservation Program General Comment #6

 WEC

 The target for savings of an ongoing conservation effort should be coordinated with the need for flow restoration to recover salmon populations.

 Comment noted. No revision made.

 Seattle's instream flows, as established in various agreements, are managed closely. Conservation has been, and will continue to be, an effective tool for enabling the utility to lengthen the useful life of existing quantities of water within the bounds of those set stream flows and preventing the need for further development of new resources.

 Page 4-4

 UTRC

 Please include a table showing SPU's current rate structure for its direct service area and discuss how the rate structure encourages

 conservation. Also, please discuss why SPU does not provide customer billing on a monthly basis. This was one of the suggestions of the technical advisory group in its report as part of the Conservation Potential Assessment.

 Draft text revised.

 See Table 2

 Item #32

 Pages 4-6,

 Page 4-24, and Appendix 4-C

 UTRC

 Discuss the impacts on firm yield of lowering the existing reliability standard. What increases in firm yield would result with reductions of reliability from the current 98 percent to 95 percent and 90 percent? What are the advantages and disadvantages of this strategy relative to continuing new source development? The plan mentions that insurmountable technical difficulties were encountered during a task force review of this issue. Please discuss these difficulties in more detail.

 Comment reviewed, partial revision made.

 SPU has not computed the system firm yield at 95% or 90% reliability using current model configurations. No Changes are being made in this WSP since the report in Appendix 4-C was completed in 1999, and was based on a study conducted in 1995.

 Please refer to associated revision

 Please discuss the artificial recharge occurring at the Highline well field in more detail. When does the recharge occur and what is the source and recharge rate? Do monitoring data indicate that the recharge is successful?

 UTRC

 Describe the non-potable uses proposed for the Glacier well.

 Draft text revised.

 See Table 2

 Item #35

 Page 4-28

 UTRC

 An alternate interpretation of Exhibit 4-1 may be that the large withdrawals during the drought of 1992 were offset only by several years of artificial recharge. Although the plan correctly states that the long-term trend from the monitoring wells indicates no "mining" of the aquifer, without artificial recharge this may not be the case. Please discuss the ability of the well field to operate effectively without artificial recharge (i.e., assuming no artificial recharge, what levels of withdrawal are sustainable without mining the aquifer?).

 City of Redmond

 Table 4-7 listing Interties between SPU and Bellevue, indicates Bellevue'' inlet meters at BelRed Road and at NE 8th Street were installed in 1983 and 1984, respectively. The approximate date of first use at those locations was closer to 1965.

 Table 4-7 lists some incorrect descriptions. City of Bellevue interties at 140th NE & NE 40th and 152nd & NE 8th provide water to the joint Bellevue/Redmond service area. All City of Kirkland listed intertries are co-service area interties for both Kirkland and Redmond. The City of Redmond has three additional existing or proposed interties with Seattle along the Tolt Pipeline at 172nd& Avondale Road and at the UPD's, that need to be included. Union Hill Water District interties have not been addressed.

 The Table 4-7 heading "Date Installed" will be revised to read "Date Meter Updated". Other technical corrections will be included in the final "conformed" copy of the WSP.

 Please include a specification that prohibits the discharge of highly chlorinated water to water bodies or conveyance systems discharging to water bodies.

 Draft text revised.

 See Table 2

 Item #43

 Page 9-7

 UTRC

 The plan identifies several policies that guide SPU's financial operation, including rate setting. Please discuss SPU's policy regarding rate equity. Specifically, how does SPU's existing rate structure distribute the cost of water equitably among customers? In other words, do the rates tend to subsidize water use for any particular customer class based on the quantity of water used? The attached graph shows an example from San Antonio, Texas. The graph shows that about 10 percent of the customers used about 30 percent of the water. It follows that the rate structure should reflect this disparity in use. An equitable rate structure for San Antonio would ensure that the 10 percent of customers with the highest use are paying a rate that generates revenue equal to 30 percent of the total rate revenue.

 Draft text revised.

 See Table 2

 Item #45

 Page 9-9

 UTRC

 The plan states that SPU's rate structure must be designed to offset any potential revenue shortfall caused by reduced summer water sales (i.e., water conservation is a barrier to desirable levels of revenue). Please comment on how changing the existing rate structure by increasing the rate at higher levels of use could be used to offset this potential loss of revenue.

 Draft text revised.

 See Table 2

 Item #44

 Appendix

 1-D

 UTRC

 Please discuss SPU's policy position with regard to the repair or replacement of existing spaghetti lines or the permitting of any new such service lines.

 Comment reviewed; no revision made.

 This is a policy and procedure that is not being amended through the WSP process.

 The only time SPU allows installation of a long privately owned service line into the public right-of-way is when a developer is building a single family residence that is the last developable lot in the neighborhood, and the water main abuts all existing customers except the last single family residence.

 Long lines are also allowed on a property in easements to accommodate a short plat from one to two lots, one of which is a back lot. Any service line in an easement must be copper and the easement must be ten feet wide.

 Pre-existing long private service lines in the public right-of-way from many years ago are removed when there is new construction/development of undeveloped or redeveloped properties. The water service is transferred to the new abutting main (whether that main is installed by a developer/property owner or by the utility) thereby obviating the need for an off-property privately owned service line.

 Appendix 4-E

 General Comment #1

 WEC

 We clearly consider reuse to be a viable alternative for non- potable water needs but it is not best suited for emergency use.

 Draft text revised.

 See Table 2

 Item #46

 Appendix 4-E General Comment #2

 WEC

 The linkage between flows and the various curtailment stages should be clearer.

 Comment reviewed; no revision made.

 The WSCP is intended to provide a framework for how to operate in water short conditions. The process of managing demands and working with agencies on stream flow issues at each stage is dynamic. Because each water shortage situation is unique, it is not practical to be more specific on the linkage between flows and each of the curtailment stages.

 Appendix 4-E General Comment #3

 WEC

 Over time as conservation becomes a more prominent water source of supply, some of the measures outlined for curtailment may have already been implemented. Therefore the potential savings that may result from some of the listed curtailment actions may be less than anticipated.

 Comment reviewed; no revision made.

 The WSCP does not proscribe specific actions to be taken at any given stage. Instead, actions such as those identified in the Plan, or others, will be implemented to the extent necessary to achieve savings due to a water supply disruption. In addition, most of the suggested curtailment measures involve short term actions which could impact the quality of life, whereas conservation measures focus on efficiencies that are typically implemented over a longer period of time.

 Appendix

 4-E, Page 4

 UTRC

 The plan refers to water levels in Lake Washington and lock operations conducted by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers. Please describe how the FERC agreement between SPU and the Corps affect SPU's operation of its diversion, particularly during periods of low flow.

 Comment reviewed; no revision made.

 There is no FERC agreement between Seattle Public Utilities (SPU) and the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (Corps). The City of Seattle and the Corps, however, have a long history of coordination concerning Cedar River and Lake Washington water management operations and planning.

 Most recently, the Corps, along with other stakeholders and agencies, provided input to the Cedar River Habitat Conservation Plan (HCP) and helped shape the Instream Flow Agreement for the Cedar River (IFA) with the City of Seattle. The newly adopted IFA requires the City of Seattle prevent stream flows from dropping below the established minimum instream flow levels in the Cedar River immediately downstream of the City's diversion facility at Landsburg at any time, particularly during periods of low flow. During low flow periods, water would be released from storage behind Masonry Dam as needed to meet both the instream flow requirements and the diversions needed for water supply. The Corps continues to be actively involved with SPU in all discussions of Cedar River and Lake Washington water management and operations planning. The Corps is also an active member on the Cedar River Instream Flow Commission that serves as a forum for communication, coordination and sharing of information to support the implementation of the IFA and for the coordination of flow management issues related to the Cedar River.

 For further description of how SPU operates its water system in relation to management of Cedar River and South Fork Tolt River instream flow agreements, please see the public review draft of SPU's 2001 Water System Plan, Section 6.3, titled, "System Operation and Control" and the draft Water Shortage Contingency Plan, Section 3, titled, "Phased Curtailment Plan" describing SPU's communications, internal operations, and supply and demand strategies during a water shortage.

 Appendix 4-E, Page 9

 UTRC

 The plan describes the need to obtain permits to use reclaimed water. This reference is not clear. King County has all necessary permits to use reclaimed water in its service area. New production facilities would require typical construction-related permits and use of right-of-way for reclaimed water pipes may require franchise permits, but the use of reclaimed water itself is currently permitted only through DOH and DOE permit processes, not local permit processes.
