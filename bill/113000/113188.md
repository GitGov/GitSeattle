 DOWNTOWN SEATTLE TRANSIT TUNNEL TRANSFER AGREEMENT

 THIS DOWNTOWN SEATTLE TRANSIT TUNNEL TRANSFER AGREEMENT ("Transfer Agreement") is entered into this _____ day of ________, 2000, by the Central Puget Sound Regional Transit Authority ("Sound Transit"), King County ("County"), and The City of Seattle ("City"). Collectively, the agencies are referred to as the "Parties."

 RECITALS

 A. The County is a home rule charter county with broad powers to provide public transportation within the County's geographic boundaries. The County owns and operates an extensive system of buses, vanpools, accessible services vehicles, park and ride lots, transit centers, transit hubs, and other transportation facilities within the County.

 B. Sound Transit is a duly organized regional transit authority existing under Chapters 81.104 and 81.112 RCW and has all powers necessary to implement a high capacity transportation ("HCT") system. On November 5, 1996, central Puget Sound area voters approved local funding for Sound Move, Sound Transit's ten-year regional transit plan. The plan includes light rail, commuter rail, and regional express bus/HOV systems that will be integrated with local transit systems and use a single or integrated, regional fare structure.

 C. The City is a city of the first class in the State of Washington with its own charter, and as such, has authority co-extensive with the State unless the exercise of a City power would violate the Constitution or a general law of the State, and all of the powers conferred upon incorporated cities and towns by Title 35 RCW and other laws of the state, and all powers that are usually exercised by municipal corporations of like character and degree. The City is responsible for, and has authority over, the laying out and supervision of all transportation public works within the City and on property belonging to or controlled by the City (including but not limited to street rights of way); and the management, construction, repair, maintenance, and control of all streets, gutters, and sidewalks; and the enforcement and implementation of City ordinances, contracts, and rules that relate to matters within the jurisdiction of the City administrative unit responsible therefor, namely Seattle Transportation. The City has specific statutory authority to prescribe the terms and conditions under which any street, avenue, alley, sidewalk, or other public ground may be used and to regulate all such use.

 D. This Transfer Agreement is entered into consistent with the principles articulated in the Memorandum of Understanding Establishing a Cooperative Relationship entered into between Sound Transit and the County on May 11, 1998, and the April 20, 1998 Memorandum of Agreement for Intergovernmental Cooperation between Sound Transit and the City regarding Light Rail Development authorized by City Ordinance 118927.

 E. The City and Sound Transit entered into a First Supplement to the Memorandum of Agreement for Intergovernmental Cooperation for the Central Light Rail Transit Project as of January 1, 1999, related to design, utility coordination, implementation coordination and mitigation, and expedited permit and approval process ("First Supplemental MOA between the City and Sound Transit").

 F. The purpose of this Transfer Agreement is to provide for the transfer of the Downtown Seattle Transit Tunnel (hereinafter "Tunnel"), including but not limited to associated real property interests, fixtures, improvements, contract rights, equipment and other related assets to Sound Transit and to assure that the region's goals of providing quality and efficient transit service are met while at the same time improving and maintaining the flow of public transportation, autos, commercial vehicles, bicycles, and pedestrians in the downtown Seattle area.

 G. The environmental impacts relating to this Transfer Agreement have been disclosed and evaluated as part of the Final Environmental Impact Statement for the Central Link Light Rail Transit Project (Oct. 1999).

 H. The Municipality of Metropolitan Seattle ("Metro"), now merged with King County, constructed the Tunnel to provide an additional right of way for buses in downtown Seattle. Since 1990 the Tunnel has provided fast, reliable and comfortable service exclusively for bus riders from throughout King County. The Tunnel was built with rails in place, anticipating that light rail could replace or complement the bus operation.

 I. Most of the Tunnel is located within the City's right-of-way, under downtown Seattle streets. The City holds its streets and other public rights-of-way, including but not limited to the right of way for the Tunnel, in trust for the convenience of public travel, and has legal authority to regulate and control the use of such streets and public rights-of-way for that purpose. Through the Master Cooperation Agreement between the City and Metro that was authorized by City Ordinance 112462, the City granted Metro (now merged with the County), the right to use the City right-of-way for the Tunnel for so long as it is used for public transportation purposes, subject to the terms and conditions of that Master Cooperation Agreement, future agreements between the City and Metro, and the City's authority over its streets and other public rights-of-way.

 J. Pursuant to RCW 81.112.070, RCW 81.112.080, Chapter 39.33 RCW and other applicable laws, the City and County are authorized to convey, lease, or otherwise contract with Sound Transit for the use of their public transportation facilities and properties and Sound Transit may contract with the City and County for the use and acquisition of all rights to the Tunnel and related facilities, structures, lands, interests in land, air rights and rights-of-way of all kinds.

 K. In accordance with Sound Move, Sound Transit is proceeding to obtain a full funding grant agreement from the Federal Transit Administration ("FTA") for the construction of the segment of the Central Link Light Rail system to extend from NE 45th Street in Seattle to a maintenance base located adjacent to South Forest Street ("Minimum Operable Segment"), together with any necessary Sound Transit Board actions to authorize the agreement.

 L. On November 18, 1999 the Sound Transit Board of Directors adopted Resolution 99-34 selecting the alignment and profiles, station locations, and vehicle maintenance base site to be built for the Central Link Light Rail Project. The Central Link Light Rail system is planned to travel through downtown Seattle, for which purpose Sound Transit intends to utilize the Tunnel. The Parties recognize that joint use by light rail trains and dual-powered buses is not the preferred long-term transit option. The Parties agree that the regional transportation system can be improved if light rail utilizes the Tunnel, and buses, which currently use the Tunnel, are rerouted onto surface streets.

 M. In order to promote effective downtown streets for all users after buses are rerouted to surface streets, significant downtown transit- oriented improvements will be made on the surface streets. Modifications to the downtown transit system will take into consideration the needs of local businesses as well as transit riders, auto users, bicyclists, commercial traffic, and pedestrians.

 NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the mutual covenants contained herein, the sufficiency of which is hereby acknowledged, the Parties agree as follows:

 6.0 BONDS AND TAX COVENANT

 6.1 Bonds

 Bonds were originally issued in 1989 to fund the Downtown Seattle Transit Project and Tunnel construction. Refunding bonds have been subsequently issued (as authorized by Municipality of Metropolitan Seattle Resolution No. 4937 and 6538 and King County Ordinance No. 13128). The original bonds and any and all refunding bonds are hereinafter referred to as the "Bonds." To facilitate the transfer of the Tunnel Assets for light rail purposes, the County agrees to retain responsibility for making the required debt service payments for the Bonds.

 6.2 Tax Covenant

 Sound Transit covenants that it will not take or permit to be taken on its behalf any action that would adversely affect the exemption from federal taxation of the interest on the Bonds. Sound Transit will take or require to be taken such acts as may reasonably be

 within its ability and as may from time to time be required under applicable law to continue the exemption from federal income taxation of the interest on the Bonds as requested by the County. During all times in which the Bonds remain outstanding, Sound Transit shall provide written notice to the King County Executive of its intent to change the use of the Tunnel from a use for public transportation to some other use, which notice shall be provided at least six (6) months prior to the effective date of such change in use.

 7.0 PAYMENT

 Sound Transit shall make payments to the County in the amounts and on the dates as set forth in Exhibit 6. In the event the Transfer Date is other than September 24, 2004, the County and Sound Transit agree to convene to review and modify Exhibit 6 to the extent they mutually agree is necessary.

 Sound Transit shall be released from its obligations to make payments pursuant to this section if it pays to the County on a date indicated in Exhibit 6 an amount equal to the payment amount due on that date, the amount of the remaining principal as of that date, and all amounts owed pursuant to this section that are past due, if any.

 It is the intent of the County to distribute payments received pursuant to this section, less additional operating expense arising from Tunnel closure, for transit service subsidy in accordance with the County's subarea allocation policies or for capital projects supporting that service.

 8.0 CONVENTION PLACE STATION ASSETS TRANSFERRED TO THE COUNTY

 8.1 Fee Property

 At no cost to the County, Sound Transit shall convey or have conveyed to the County in fee simple certain property owned by the Washington State Department of Transportation and existing in the Convention Place Station. The property to be conveyed includes the property identified in Exhibit 7 and all other property associated therewith by virtue of any adjacent street vacations. If this property is not conveyed to the County on or before January 1, 2002, Sound Transit shall make a payment to the County in the amount of $14.1 million (2004 dollars) (the estimated value of the property) in lieu of providing the property to the County. Such payment shall be made no later than January 1, 2003.

 8.2 Street and Alley Vacation

 In 1988, in response to the County's petition, the City granted conceptual approval to the vacation of the alley within Block 32, Heirs of Sarah A. Bell's Second Addition to the

 City of Seattle according to the plat recorded in Vol. 1 of Plats, page 121, Records of King County, Washington, and that portion of Terry Avenue lying adjacent to Lots 7, 8 and 9 of that same block and Lots 4, 5 and 6 of Block 44 in the same addition. Final vacation of the subject alley and portion of Terry Avenue was conditioned upon the County's providing pedestrian access between Olive and Pine Streets as noted in Comptroller's File No. 295303. To date, the County has not satisfied those conditions so the vacation of the alley and the specified portion of Terry Avenue has not been completed.

 After the Transfer Date, the County contemplates utilizing the Convention Place Station property (as described in Exhibit 8) as a site for a transit oriented development. In order to accomplish this development, vacation of Terry Avenue and the alley within the Convention Place Station property is necessary.

 The City supports the development of the Convention Place Station in an intensive and transit-oriented manner and the provision of a public pedestrian access through the Convention Place Station property between Olive Way and Pine Street. Accordingly, the City's legislative authority is willing, upon request of the County or its proposed developer and the presentation to the City's legislative authority of a master plan for the redevelopment of Convention Place Station area, to consider modifying the conditions imposed with respect to the County's 1988 petition to vacate such alley and portion of Terry Avenue.

 The County shall use its best efforts to ensure that the conditions imposed with respect to the County's 1988 petition or such modified conditions as the City's legislative authority and the County may agree upon are implemented in connection with any redevelopment of the Convention Place Station area. Included in such County efforts shall be the making of one or more presentations to the City's legislative authority to keep such officials fully informed regarding the status of redevelopment efforts with respect to such area. The City agrees to expedite its review of any modification of the conditions associated with such alley and street vacation proposed by the County or its site developer. It is the intent of the County to ensure that in any conveyance of the Convention Place Station site or a substantial portion thereof for redevelopment, the grantee is obligated to provide free, public pedestrian access between Olive Way and Pine Street through such site and to otherwise comply with the design review, development, and other conditions imposed both with respect to the vacation of such alley and portion of Terry Avenue and new construction at the time such development occurs. The County recognizes that additional conditions may be imposed by the City Council pursuant to a request to modify the conditions imposed in response to the County's 1988 petition, including, but not limited to, requiring that the City be named as a third party beneficiary of such obligation, and that the City be granted the right to specifically enforce such obligation.

 Any additional fee or cost imposed by the City for the vacation of such alley and portion of Terry Avenue shall be paid by Sound Transit. If such vacation is not granted by the City by January 1, 2002, Sound Transit shall make a payment to the County in the amount of $2.5 million (2004 dollars). Such payment shall be made no later than January 1, 2003.

 8.3 Transfer of FTA Interest in Convention Place Station

 Sound Transit consents to all FTA interest and equity in Convention Place Station (including all real property, improvements, equipment, fixtures and systems existing on or in the Convention Place Station property as that property is described in Exhibit 8) being transferred to the Tunnel Assets or property owned by Sound Transit. The County and Sound Transit shall jointly seek FTA approval for such transfer. Upon such transfer and as of the Transfer Date, Sound Transit shall be solely responsible for all requirements and obligations that arise from such FTA interest and equity. If the FTA does not approve such a transfer on or before January 1, 2002, Sound Transit shall make a payment to the County in the amount of $4.8 million (2004 dollars) in lieu of the transfer, which represents the estimated value of removal of the FTA interest. Such payment shall be made no later than January 1, 2003.

 9.0 DISTRIBUTION OF CONVENTION PLACE STATION PROCEEDS

 9.1 Payment to Sound Transit

 If the County receives a sufficient net return, as defined below, from the sale or development of the Convention Place Station property, the County shall pay to Sound Transit an amount equal to the first two payments Sound Transit makes pursuant to section 12.1 plus $1 million, which total amount shall be adjusted by the percentage change that occurred in the CPI for the period that most closely corresponds to the period between the date this Transfer Agreement is executed and the time payment is made (which adjusted payment amount is hereinafter referred to as "Payment Amount"). The County shall pay the Payment Amount to Sound Transit only if the net return the County receives from the sale or development of the Convention Place Station property is equal to or exceeds: 1) the Payment Amount; plus 2) $33.4 million as adjusted by the percentage change in the CPI for the period that mostly closely corresponds to the period between September 2004 and the date of such sale or return (this adjusted value is hereinafter referred to as "Equity Value"). If the County's net return exceeds the Equity Value but is less than the Equity Value plus the Payment Amount, the County shall pay to Sound Transit an amount equal to such excess. In no case shall total payment exceed the Payment Amount.

 Payment to Sound Transit pursuant to this section shall be made within six (6) months of the County's receipt of sufficient net return from the sale or development of the property.

 Except for information that is subject to attorney-client privilege or otherwise exempt from disclosure under Chapter 42.17 RCW, the County shall provide Sound Transit and the City access at such reasonable times as requested to all County records relating to the development and/or sale of the Convention Place Station property.

 9.2 Equity Distribution

 Pursuant to this Transfer Agreement, portions of the County's equity in the Tunnel Assets may be provided to the County by the transfer of certain property rights in Convention Place Station property. That property will not produce actual revenue until a later date. In order to provide each County subarea with its share of Tunnel Asset equity, it is the intent of the County to distribute funds acquired from the sale or development of the Convention Place Station property (in amounts up to but not exceeding the Equity Value) for transit service subsidy in accordance with subarea allocation policies.

 9.3 Provision of New Services and Facilities

 If the net return from the sale or transit oriented development of the Convention Place Station property exceeds the amount of the Equity Value plus Payment Amount, the County intends that those additional funds will be utilized for new transit services or facilities in the Seattle/North King subarea pursuant to a separate agreement to be entered between the City and the County. That agreement may identify City actions to increase the value of the Convention Place Station property and development. It is the intent of the County to invest proceeds from the increased value specifically attributable to such City actions in new transit services or facilities in the Seattle/North King subarea.

 9.4 Definition of "CPI"

 For the purpose of this Transfer Agreement, the abbreviation "CPI" means the Consumer Price Index for all Urban Consumers (1982-84=100) as published by the U.S. Department of Labor Bureau of Labor Statistics or its successor for the Seattle-Tacoma-Bremerton Metropolitan Statistical Area; Provided, that in the event of any change in the index base (1982-84=100) or other modification of such index, the parties hereto shall apply whatever conversion factor(s) are necessary to establish the true percentage change in the CPI for any period in which such modification(s) occur, and in the event such index is discontinued, the parties hereto shall select and use for such adjustment purposes, another, similar index that reflects consumer price changes.

 10.0 LOCAL IMPROVEMENT DISTRICT

 A local improvement district encompassing properties specially benefited by the Tunnel and related projects was established by Metro. As successor to Metro, the County has and shall continue to administer the local improvement district and collect and retain the special assessments. The County shall give timely notice to Sound Transit of any public proceeding regarding any proposed reassessment regarding the local improvement district.

 Sound Transit shall defend, indemnify and hold harmless the County, its officials and employees from and against any and all claims, damages, costs, expenses (including reasonable attorney fees), demands, defenses, administrative appeals, causes of action, protests, grievances, and lawsuits (collectively referred to as "Claims") in which it is claimed or alleged that the transfer of the Tunnel Assets, the rerouting of buses to surface streets, Sound Transit's activities, or use and/or modification of the Tunnel Assets subsequent to the Transfer Date, or any other action taken pursuant to this Transfer Agreement impacts the validity, lawfulness, or collection of the special assessments and/or requires a refund of said assessments, compensation for the taking of property, and/or other payment. Sound Transit's obligations under this section shall extend but not be limited to indemnifying and compensating the County for any assessments that must be refunded and/or that would have been collected but for such Claims. Sound Transit's obligations under this section shall not extend to Claims based solely on: 1) any procedural defects on the part of the County in the creation of the local improvement district or in reassessing the properties in the district; or 2) County clerical errors in processing assessment payments.

 11.0 DOWNTOWN SEATTLE TRAFFIC AND STREET IMPROVEMENTS

 11.1 Objectives

 In order to mitigate the impacts of dedicating the Tunnel solely to light rail use, the Parties agree that certain surface street and traffic improvements shall be made and be consistent with the project record of decision mitigation measures. These improvements shall be sufficient to allow downtown bus service after closure of the Tunnel to bus use to meet or exceed bus service surface performance levels existing during a selected measurement period immediately prior to the closure of the Tunnel ("Measurement Period") as regards to travel time, convenience, security, safety, and passenger comfort, except to the extent any performance level change is due to a substantial change in bus service operations other than a rerouting of Tunnel traffic to the surface. The Measurement Period shall be agreed upon by the project managers identified in Section 19 hereof, but shall not be less than a sixty (60) day period of time so that the influence of individual irregularities in bus service and other aberrations are minimized and shall not include any period in which there is a major modification of the downtown bus service schedule or significant downtown street or utility repairs or projects.

 In order to facilitate meeting this objective, the Parties agree to create the Monitor and Maintain Committee. The Committee shall be directed to conduct activities to measure downtown Seattle transportation system performance and make recommendations to the Parties as warranted to ensure that downtown Seattle transportation system performance after closure of the Tunnel to buses is maintained. In performing its functions, the Committee shall be directed to consult with and seek the input of downtown Seattle, Seattle neighborhoods, and suburban stakeholders.

 11.2 Required Improvements

 The 3rd Avenue peak period traffic restrictions, 5th Avenue South transit contra-flow lane, 9th Avenue transit contra-flow lane, Olive Way transit priority improvements, Prefontaine Place South reconfiguration and all other improvements, projects and actions identified in Exhibit 9 shall be constructed, installed, completed, and implemented prior to the Transfer Date. The improvements, projects and actions identified in Exhibit 9 are hereinafter referred to as the "Downtown Seattle Traffic and Street Improvements."

 11.3 Amendments to Exhibit 9

 Amendments to Exhibit 9 that relate to 3rd Avenue peak period traffic restrictions, 5th Avenue South transit contra-flow lane, 9th Avenue transit contra-flow lane, Olive Way transit priority improvements, or Prefontaine Place South reconfiguration must be approved by the King County Council, Seattle City Council, and Sound Transit Board.

 11.4 Schedule

 The Parties anticipate that the Downtown Seattle Traffic and Street Improvements will be completed and implemented in accordance with the schedule set forth in Exhibit 9.

 11.5 Duration of Surface Improvements

 In order to adequately mitigate the impacts of Tunnel closure and allow the Parties sufficient time to analyze the subsequent impact of the Tunnel opening for light rail service, the Downtown Seattle Traffic and Street Improvements shall remain in place and in effect until at least one year after the Tunnel is opened by Sound Transit for fare service light rail.

 From one (1) year after the Tunnel is opened by Sound Transit for fare service light rail until such time as Sound Transit begins operating light rail service to Northgate or such time as downtown surface street bus volumes return to those levels existing during the Measurement Period, whichever is earlier, the City may modify or remove the Downtown Seattle Traffic and Street Improvements, or any portion thereof, to the extent such modification or removal is within its authority and unless such modification or removal will degrade downtown bus service performance levels as regards to: 1) travel time; or 2) convenience, security, safety, and passenger comfort. During this period of time, prior to implementing or requiring any modification to or removal of the 3rd Avenue peak period traffic restrictions, 5th Avenue South transit contra-flow lane, 9th Avenue transit contra-flow lane, Olive Way transit priority improvements, or Prefontaine Place South reconfiguration that may potentially result in such degradation, the City's Mayor and City Council shall timely confer with the County Executive and County Council and Sound Transit and allow them a full opportunity to review and comment on such proposed change or removal. During this period of time, prior to implementing changes to or removal of any other Downtown Seattle Traffic and Street Improvements that may result in such degradation, the City Traffic Engineer shall timely confer with the Director of the County's Department of Transportation and Executive Director of Sound Transit and allow them a full opportunity to review and comment on such proposed change or removal.

 11.6 Agreed Upon Changes To or Removal Of Downtown Traffic and Street

 Improvements

 Notwithstanding any other provision of this Transfer Agreement except Section 16.0, modifications to or removal of the 3rd Avenue peak period traffic restrictions, 5th Avenue South transit contra-flow lane, 9th Avenue transit contra-flow lane, Olive Way transit priority improvements, or Prefontaine Place South reconfiguration may occur at any time upon a mutual agreement approved by the King County Council, Seattle City Council, and Sound Transit's Board. Modification to or removal of other Downtown Seattle Traffic and Street Improvements may occur at any time upon the written agreement of the Director of the County's Department of Transportation, Executive Director of Sound Transit, and the City Traffic Engineer.

 11.7 Cost of Downtown Seattle Traffic and Street Improvements

 Except for the amounts Exhibit 9 indicates shall be paid by the County or City, Sound Transit shall be responsible for all design, permitting, implementation and construction costs associated with the Downtown Seattle Traffic and Street Improvements. Sound Transit shall reimburse the City and the County for any and all such costs that either entity incurs, unless an established fee is imposed in lieu of any such cost, in which event Sound Transit shall pay the applicable fee. Estimates of the costs (in year 2000 dollars) to complete the Downtown Seattle Traffic and Street Improvements are set forth in Exhibit 9.

 11.8 Permits, Licenses, Easements

 The Parties agree that all required licenses, easements, and permits shall be obtained for construction and implementation of the Downtown Seattle Traffic and Street Improvements. Consistent with the April 20, 1998 Memorandum of Agreement for Intergovernmental Cooperation for the Central Light Rail Transit Project and the January 1, 1999, First Supplement to such Memorandum of Agreement between the City and Sound Transit, the City shall expedite the issuance and granting of all City-required licenses, easements and permits in order to facilitate completion of the Downtown Seattle Traffic and Street Improvements in accordance with the schedule set forth in Exhibit 9.

 11.9 Completion of Downtown Seattle Traffic and Street Improvements

 The party that is responsible for implementing or completing each Downtown Seattle Traffic and Street Improvement as identified in Exhibit 9 shall be responsible for all aspects of designing, constructing, and/or implementing such improvement or contracting for the design, construction or implementation of such improvement.

 11.11 Ownership and Maintenance

 The party designated as the party to own and maintain a Downtown Seattle Traffic and Street Improvement, as identified in Exhibit 9, shall be solely liable for the ownership, ongoing maintenance, repair, and replacement of said improvement.

 12.0 BUS RELATED COSTS ASSUMED BY SOUND TRANSIT

 12.1 Increased Operating Costs Arising From Tunnel Closure

 In order to compensate the County for additional operating costs of bus routes serving downtown Seattle during the period starting when the Tunnel is closed for buses and ending when Light Rail service begins, Sound Transit shall pay the County an annual amount of $ 2.3 million. The first payment due pursuant to this section shall be adjusted by the percentage change that occurred in the CPI for the period that most closely corresponds to the period between the execution of this Transfer Agreement and the first annual payment. Subsequent payment amounts shall be adjusted by the percentage change that occurred in the CPI during the period that most closely corresponds to the period between the date the last payment was due to the date such subsequent payment is made. The payment amount required by this section reflects an adjustment that accounts for the savings to the County of Tunnel operating costs. The first annual payment shall be due on the Transfer Date. Subsequent payments shall be due on that same date each year until the Tunnel is opened for fare service light rail. Payment for any partial year of Tunnel closure shall be pro-rated based upon the portion of the year in which the Tunnel is closed.

 12.2 County Activities to Support Light Rail Construction

 Sound Transit shall reimburse the County for the costs of completing the bus stop and bus layover removal and relocation, trolley infrastructure work, customer information activities and other work identified in Exhibit 10 in an amount not to exceed the total amount set forth therein, which amount shall be adjusted by the percentage change that occurred in the CPI for the period of time that most closely corresponds to the period between the execution of this Transfer Agreement and the date of payment.

 Sound Transit shall also reimburse the County for the actual costs the County incurs to conduct other, work and activities not identified in Exhibit 10 if such work or activity is requested by Sound Transit or its contractor(s).

 12.3 Construction-Related Delay of County Buses

 Sound Transit shall utilize its best efforts to avoid or minimize delays to normal bus operations as a result of light rail construction activities, both in downtown Seattle and elsewhere. Those best efforts shall include, as a minimum, imposing requirements in contract special provisions upon light rail construction contractors for:

 a. Maintenance of normal bus flows past construction sites by keeping traffic lanes open, providing detour lanes, using flaggers, or similar methods as appropriate at each particular site;

 b. Coordination and advance planning with Sound Transit's construction manager and the County's and City's staff in connection with changes that may be necessary to bus routes, lane usage, bus stop locations, trolley wire relocations, or other changes affecting normal bus operations as a result of construction activities; and

 c. Payment of monetary damages in the amount of actual damages incurred by the County as a result of construction activities. Damages would be based on the actual costs of adding bus travel time (if it resulted in documented increased County operating costs) and/or additional bus trips to the schedule as a result of construction delays, payment of overtime, and/or provision of more than normal street supervision of bus operations.

 The County shall be responsible for submitting claims directly to Sound Transit for construction related delay damages arising from the activities of Sound Transit or any of its contractors. Within 45 days of receiving such claim, Sound Transit shall reimburse the County for the County's reasonable and actual costs arising from or related to light rail construction activities in downtown Seattle or elsewhere, regardless of whether Sound Transit receives credit or payment for those costs from its contractor(s).

 12.4 Cost of Utilizing Replacement Bus Layover Space

 In transferring the Tunnel Assets to Sound Transit, the County will lose critical bus layover space currently provided by the International District Station and other locations. Upon its further review, the City may approve replacement bus layover space as identified in Exhibit 11. In the event such approval is not granted or is only granted in part, Sound Transit shall reimburse the County for increased operating costs, as reasonably determined by the County, arising from utilizing locations other than those identified on Exhibit 11 as bus layover space. Payment for such costs shall be due monthly or as otherwise invoiced by the County. Such payments by Sound Transit to the County shall not exceed $1.4 million as adjusted by the percentage change in the CPI for the period that most closely corresponds to the period between the date this Transfer Agreement is executed and the date of such payments.

 13.0 BUS FACILITY IMPROVEMENTS ASSOCIATED WITH

 THE LIGHT RAIL PROJECT

 13.1 Cost and Completion of Improvements

Exhibit 12 may be modified by the written agreement of the Director of Light Rail for Sound Transit and Director of the County's Department of Transportation. Sound Transit shall be responsible for performing to the extent permitted by law, or subcontracting for the performance of, all design, engineering, community planning, demolition, removal, production, construction, repair, or other work necessary to complete the improvements identified in Exhibit 12.

 13.2 Review of Design and Specifications

 The County shall have an opportunity to review and comment on all designs, specifications, engineering work, and estimates for completion of Bus-Facility Improvements, but such review shall not in any way relieve Sound Transit of its responsibilities for such work.

 13.3 Ownership of Improvements

 Except for bus shelters, benches, trolley wires and associated poles and equipment, signage, and litter receptacles installed by the County and any other improvements as agreed to in writing, the improvements identified in Exhibit 12 shall be the property of Sound Transit and Sound Transit shall be solely responsible and liable for the ongoing maintenance, repair, and replacement of said improvements.

 13.4 Trolley Wire Extension

 The County shall be responsible for the costs of extending bus trolley wire to the boundary of light rail station stops the County determines are to be served by County buses. Sound Transit shall be responsible for the costs of trolley wire relocation and installation at light rail station sites.

 14.0 CONSIDERATION

 In exchange for the transfer and conveyance of the Tunnel Assets and the City's consent to such transfer and conveyance and its grant to Sound Transit to use the street right-of-way, Sound Transit is providing the County with the full value of said assets and is reimbursing the City for certain costs or paying City fees imposed by applicable law, ordinance, rule or regulation. The value provided by Sound Transit includes, but is not limited to, payments to the County as required herein, delivery to the County of Convention Place Station assets or certain payments in lieu thereof, consenting to transfer of FTA interests in Convention Place Station, remittance of certain payments in lieu of the vacation of Terry Avenue as contemplated in Subsection 8.3 , assumption of responsibility for the maintenance and operation of the Tunnel Assets, assumption of liability for the Tunnel Assets, assumption of certain costs associated with the Downtown Seattle Traffic and Street Improvements, reimbursement of County costs related to light rail construction activities, assumption of the costs of constructing certain bus facility improvements near light rail stations, provision of compensation for increased operating costs associated with use of replacement bus layover space, and assumption of the obligation to pay the FTA and the State for certain amounts that may be owed as a result of this Transfer Agreement. The mutual benefits and satisfaction of the promises set forth in this Transfer Agreement constitute adequate consideration and full value for the transfer and conveyance of the Tunnel Assets.

 15.0 SUBAREA FINANCING

 Consistent with Sound Transit Resolution 99-34, Sound Transit agrees that subareas and annexed areas connecting to Phase I of the light rail system after the Transfer Date shall not be required to contribute a portion of the capital cost for obtaining the Tunnel Assets or constructing the Downtown Seattle Traffic and Street Improvements.

 16.0 COUNTY REACQUISITION OF TUNNEL ASSETS

 If, after the Transfer Date, Sound Transit's Board abandons the construction of the Minimum Operable Segment, the County may terminate Sound Transit's ownership of the Tunnel Assets and re-enter and repossess the Tunnel Assets upon notice to Sound Transit of such termination. Within ninety (90) days of such notice, Sound Transit shall execute and record all documents necessary to reconvey all rights of use and ownership of the Tunnel Assets to the County. If the Tunnel Assets are repossessed by the County pursuant to this paragraph, Sound Transit shall pay to the County all sums necessary to restore the Tunnel Assets to a condition that allows them to be utilized for bus transit operations of the same level of functionality, safety, security, convenience, efficiency, aesthetics, and passenger comfort that existed immediately prior to the Transfer Date. Upon the County's repossession of the Tunnel Assets and the payment by Sound Transit of any sums due under this Transfer Agreement, Sound Transit shall be released from its obligation to continue to make payments pursuant to Section 7 of this Transfer Agreement; in addition, any restrictions in Subsections 11.3, 11.5 and 11.6 on the City's authority to modify the Downtown Seattle Traffic and Street Improvements shall be inapplicable as of the earliest of the alternative dates set forth in those subsections or the date that the Tunnel is again generally used for downtown bus traffic. If at any time Sound Transit provides written notice to the County that it has abandoned construction of the Minimum Operable Segment, the County must exercise its right of repossession under this paragraph within ninety (90) days of its receipt of such notice or such right shall expire.

 If, after the Minimum Operable Segment is utilized for regularly scheduled fare service light rail, Sound Transit discontinues or fails to use substantially all of the Tunnel for public transportation purposes, the County shall have the right of first opportunity to reacquire the Tunnel Assets. This right shall be exercisable upon (a) receipt of notice from Sound Transit that it intends to discontinue its use of the Tunnel or (b) a finding by a court of competent jurisdiction that Sound Transit has discontinued use of substantially all of the Tunnel Assets. Within 60 days after the County's right becomes exercisable, the County shall provide written notice to Sound Transit if it intends to reacquire the Tunnel Assets. In such event, the Parties shall negotiate in good faith to accomplish the transfer. For purposes of such reacquisition, the value of the Tunnel Assets shall be established by a method comparable to that used to value the Tunnel Assets for purposes of this Transfer Agreement. If the parties cannot agree as to the value of the Tunnel Assets or other terms and conditions of the County's reacquisition within a period of 120 days, the matter shall be submitted to an independent mediator. Such mediation shall be non-binding and shall be completed within a period of no greater than 90 days. Upon any such reacquisition of the Tunnel Assets by the County, notwithstanding any other provision in this Transfer Agreement, Subsections 11.1 through 11.6 shall no longer have any force or effect.

 17.0 E-3 BUSWAY

 Sound Transit desires to use a portion of the E-3 Busway and adjacent County-owned property for operation of its light rail system. The County may grant Sound Transit a limited right to use the E-3 Busway and adjacent property by separate agreement on such terms and conditions as are agreeable to the County and Sound Transit. The parties acknowledge that Sound Transit's use of the Busway and adjacent property may eliminate the ability of the County to utilize a portion of the Busway and County-owned property for employee parking as planned. At a minimum, any agreement granting Sound Transit the right to use the E-3 Busway shall require Sound Transit to replace any employee parking so eliminated with employee parking space of the same quality, capacity, and convenience as would have been provided by the Busway and adjacent property. Such agreement shall also require Sound Transit to make any payments due in exchange for the State's authorization of Sound Transit's use of the E3 Busway, if any such authorization or payments are required.

 18.0 TAXES AND COSTS

 Sound Transit shall be responsible for any and all sales, transfer, excise, title insurance, documentary and other taxes, fees, penalties, costs and charges (not including staff time) arising out of or related to the transfer and conveyance to it of the Tunnel Assets.

Such records shall be made available for inspection during the record-keeper's regular business hours within a reasonable time after the record-keeper's receipt of a request for inspection of the same.

 24.0 INDEMNIFICATION FOR ENVIRONMENTAL PROBLEMS

 24.1. To the maximum extent allowed by law and except to the extent caused by the negligence or intentional misconduct of the County, Sound Transit agrees, for itself, its successors and assigns, to defend, indemnify and hold the County harmless from and against any and all environmental problems that exist on, emanate from, or have emanated from the Tunnel Assets as of and/or after the Transfer Date and from and against any claims, complaints, demands, actions, causes of action, suits, losses, contribution actions, actions by an instrumentality of a federal, state or local government, costs, damages, fines, penalties, expenses, judgments or liability of any kind related to such environmental problems.
