Rates for such ~~Councilmember~~ parking by City Officials shall be established by the Fleets and Facilities Director pursuant to Seattle Municipal Code Section

 3.18.030(G), and shall be established in an amount that is consistent with fees charged to other City officers and employees for comparable parking privileges. City ~~Councilmembers~~Officials also shall be eligible for other types of parking permits, including but not limited to carpool parking permits, on the same terms and pursuant to the same rates as are applicable to other City officers and employees; and may request the issuance of occasional City-paid one-day parking passes, on the same basis as those are available to other City officers and employees, when it is necessary to park privately-owned motor vehicles in such garage or facilities for purposes that are solely related to City business. City ~~Councilmembers~~Officials also are eligible to use City motor-pool vehicles pursuant to Seattle Municipal Code Section 3.18.140.

~~B.~~C. City Council Positions 1, 3, 5, 7 and 9 shall become subject to S~~s~~ubsection ~~A~~B  of this S~~s~~ection at the time of commencement of the next term of office in January, 2000.

 owned motor vehicles prior to such effective dates, and the Fleets and Facilities Director shall be authorized to collect such voluntary payments prior to such effective dates, and to establish a payroll check-off or deduction system to facilitate such collection.

 Section 2.
