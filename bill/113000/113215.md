 AN ORDINANCE creating an Alcohol Impact Area in Pioneer Square and requiring reports to Council regarding voluntary efforts to reduce chronic public inebriation.

 WHEREAS, the King County Board of Health has declared by resolution that chronic public inebriation is a public health problem of the highest order; and

 WHEREAS, over the past four years the Chronic Public Inebriate Systems Solution Committee, a community-based partnership representing local neighborhood associations, the business community, health care and human service providers, citizen advocates and Seattle and King County governments, has developed a comprehensive strategy to reduce chronic public inebriation, including expanded and improved access to treatment, housing, case management, and vocational development as well as law enforcement; and

 WHEREAS, an important element in the plan to reduce chronic public inebriation is to restrict the availability of alcohol sold to chronic public inebriates in areas where such sales threaten both the public's health, safety and welfare and that of the chronic public inebriates; and

 WHEREAS, Section 314-12-215 of the Washington Administrative Code ("WAC") provides that as a condition precedent to the City requesting that the Washington State Liquor Control Board enact additional restrictions on off-premises alcohol sales within an area of the City adversely affected by chronic public inebriation or illegal activity associated with alcohol sales or consumption, an ordinance must designate such an area as an Alcohol Impact Area; and

 WHEREAS, WAC 314-12-215 also provides that efforts to implement voluntary agreements with liquor licensees to reduce such sales within an alcohol impact area must be attempted for at least six months before seeking additional regulatory restrictions from the State Liquor Control Board;

 Now therefore,

 BE IT ORDAINED BY THE CITY OF SEATTLE AS FOLLOWS:

 Section 1. The City Council finds:

 A. Pioneer Square residents, business owners and community organizations, including the Pioneer Square Community Council, the Pioneer Square Business Improvement Association and the Pioneer Square Community Development Organization, have appealed to the City for relief from the adverse effects of chronic public inebriation and illegal activity associated with off-premises alcohol sales and consumption in the Pioneer Square Area (the "area") and for the enactment of an ordinance establishing a Pioneer Square Alcohol Impact Area.

 B. The records of the Seattle Police and Fire Departments, other emergency response records and other evidence document a pervasive pattern of public intoxication and/or public consumption of alcohol in the area.

 C. Chronic public inebriation and illegal activity associated with off-premises alcohol sales and consumption within the proposed Alcohol Impact Area are contributing to the deterioration of the general quality of life within the area and threaten the welfare, health, peace and safety of the area's visitors and occupants.

 D. Over the past several years the City and community groups have sought to reduce the problems associated with chronic public inebriation in Pioneer Square by, among other things, seeking voluntary changes in the business practices of liquor licensees in order to reduce alcohol sales to chronic inebriates. Despite some intermittent improvements, such voluntary efforts have by and large not been successful.

 E. The City, along with the Chronic Public Inebriate System Solutions Committee, is embarking on a new effort to work with off-premises liquor licensees in the Pioneer Square Area who have been notified of the chronic public inebriation problem in the area and are being requested to agree to certain business practices designed to reduce chronic public inebriation that will improve the public health and safety in the area. These include restrictions on the sale of certain alcohol products, limitations on container sizes and packaging, and reduced hours of off-premises alcohol sales.

 Section 2.

 Pioneer Square Alcohol Impact Area.

 A. The geographical area in the City of Seattle described below (and shown in Attachment A) is declared to be an Alcohol Impact Area as defined by WAC 314-12-215:

 That area bounded by South King Street on the South, Alaskan Way on the West, Columbia Street on the North and Fourth Avenue and Fourth Avenue South on the East, including in all instances both sides of each boundary street.

 B. The Director of the Department of Neighborhoods and the Chief of Police shall provide quarterly updates to the Council's Finance, Budget and Economic Development Committee regarding the voluntary efforts to address the Chronic Public Inebriate issues in the Pioneer Square Alcohol Impact Area.

 C. Nine months from the effective date of this ordinance, the Director of the Department of Neighborhoods and the Chief of Police shall provide a report to the Council's Finance, Budget and Economic Development Committee on the voluntary efforts to address chronic public inebriation issues in the Pioneer Square Alcohol Impact Area. This report shall include relevant crime statistics, police reports, emergency medical response data, detoxification reports, sanitation reports, public health records and other information which document the success or failure of efforts to address chronic public inebriation issues in the Pioneer Square Alcohol Impact Area. The report will also collect the same data from Queen Anne, Belltown, Capitol Hill, International District, and Downtown Core. All data collected shall cover the period of 1998 to the date of the report to Council. Based on the information contained in the report, the Council may consider the adoption of legislation directing the Chief of Police to request the State Liquor Control Board to impose further restrictions on liquor licensees, pursuant to WAC 314-12-215, in the Pioneer Square Alcohol Impact Area. Such legislation must be adopted by Council before any representative of the City requests the State Liquor Control Board to impose such restrictions.
