 B. ~~Exception: Construction may be commenced no sooner than thirty (30) days after the date of filing of a judicial appeal of a decision of the Shoreline Hearings Board approving the Director's decision to grant the shoreline substantial development permit or approving a portion of the substantial development for which the permit was granted, unless construction is prohibited until all Superior Court review proceedings are~~ final after a judicial hearing as provided in RCW 90.58.140. Any applicant who wishes to begin construction pursuant to this section prior to termination of all review proceedings does so at the applicant's own risk.
