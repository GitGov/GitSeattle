 AN ORDINANCE relating to the Department of Parks and Recreation; authorizing execution of a lease agreement together with an option to purchase property at 4201 West Marginal Way Southwest.

 WHEREAS, the Department of Parks and Recreation's current maintenance facility at 802 Roy Street is considered too small, a seismic hazard, and a less than optimal use of the South Lake Union area; and

 WHEREAS, there is not sufficient space available at that City-owned property to efficiently and safely use the same for municipal purposes; and

 WHEREAS, the Department of Parks and Recreation has conducted a lengthy and thorough search over three years for suitable property within the City to house its maintenance functions and has concluded that the real property known as the "Westbridge Building" at 4201 West Marginal Way Southwest and the associated land ("the Subject Property") meets the Department's criteria for a suitable site; and

 WHEREAS, the building on the Subject Property contains approximately 114,081 square feet of warehouse/storage and office space, of which the Department of Parks and Recreation desires to lease approximately 90,749 square feet of warehouse/storage space and approximately 12,832 square feet of office space; and

 WHEREAS, Seattle Municipal Code 3.18.240 requires City Council approval for any lease of property in excess of 5,000 square feet of office space or 9,000 square feet of improved space other than office space; and

 WHEREAS, the Department of Parks and Recreation proposes to enter into a ten-year lease agreement with two, ten-year renewal options with Patton Westbridge LLC and Westbridge LLC for a portion of the Subject Property for use by the Department's maintenance and operations facilities; and

 WHEREAS, the lease agreement obligates the Landlord to construct approximately $3.6 million in tenant improvements requested by the Department of Parks and Recreation to be paid back through monthly payments during the initial ten-year term of the lease; and

 WHEREAS, the Department of Parks and Recreation will fund the cost of the lease, the move and the associated increased costs of operating its maintenance function at the Subject Property within its existing budget resources; and

 WHEREAS, the lease agreement includes an option for the City to purchase the Subject Property within three years after the commencement of the lease; and

 WHEREAS, the bank providing financing for the tenant improvements to be completed by the landlord under the lease requires that the City execute a Subordination, Non-Disturbance and Attornment Agreement in connection with such financing; and

 WHEREAS, a draft Subordination, Non-Disturbance and Attornment Agreement has been attached to said lease as Exhibit "D" which draft agreement is substantially similar to the Subordination, Non- Disturbance and Attornment Agreement executed by another tenant in the building on the Subject Property, but because the terms and conditions of the particular Subordination, Non-Disturbance and Attornment Agreement the City will be requested to execute have not been confirmed by such bank as of the date of City Council action on this legislation, such exhibit may need to be modified to meet the bank's conditions; and

 WHEREAS, it is in the interests of the City Council to permit, without further City Council action, the modification of the Subordination, Non-Disturbance and Attornment Agreement attached hereto as Exhibit D to facilitate the financing and the making of the tenant improvements contemplated in the lease; and

 WHEREAS, the Department of Parks and Recreation will seek Council approval through a future ordinance to issue a Notice of Intent to exercise the option to purchase; and

 WHEREAS, Council Bill 113889 includes a placeholder to finance Parks projects such as the acquisition of a replacement property for Roy Street Shops through Councilmanic debt; NOW, THEREFORE,

 BE IT ORDAINED BY THE CITY OF SEATTLE AS FOLLOWS:

 1. Lease Data; Exhibits.

 The following terms shall have the following meanings, except as otherwise specifically modified in this Lease:

 A. Building: The "Westbridge Building" located at 4201 West Marginal Way Southwest, Seattle, Washington 98106, which consists of approximately 114,081 square feet of space situated on real property described more particularly in Subsection 1.D.

 B.

Prior to the Commencement Date, the parties shall calculate the actual total square footage of the Premises (and allocate such total square footage between warehouse/storage space and office space) by measuring the Premises from the exterior surface of exterior walls and mid-point of interior walls that are common with the Premises leased by Landlord to Bank of America.

 C. Common Areas: All areas situated on the Landlord's Property that are for use by tenants of such property, in common, including but not limited to parking areas, streets, driveways, sidewalks, curbs, delivery passages, loading areas, lighting facilities.

 D. Landlord's Property: The Premises are located in the Building on property legally defined as follows:

 That portion of the following described property lying easterly of the west line of Section 18, Township 24 North, Range 4 East, Willamette Meridian, in King County, Washington, described as follows:

 Parcel A:

 Beginning at the intersection of the south line of Government Lot 7 in Section 18 and the westerly margin of West Marginal Way Southwest; thence westerly along the south line of said Lot 7, and the south line of Lot 1 in Section 13, Township 24 North, Range 3 East, Willamette Meridian, to the southerly extension of the east line of Block 3, Hasslocher's Addition to West Seattle, according to the plat thereof, recorded in Volume 15 of Plats, page 20, in King County Washington; thence northerly along said easterly line of Block 3, a distance of 394.73 feet, more or less, to the fractional north line thereof; thence westerly along said fractional north line, 31 feet to the easterly line said Block 3; thence north along said easterly line, to the south line of Sander's Second Addition to West Seattle, according to the plat thereof, recorded in Volume 3 of Plats, page 56, in King County, Washington; thence easterly, along said south line to the westerly margin of West Marginal Way Southwest; thence southeasterly along said westerly margin to the point of beginning.

 Parcel B:

 Lots 10 and 11, Block 7, Sanders Second Addition to West Seattle, according to the plat thereof, recorded in Volume 3 of Plats, page 56, in King County, Washington; except that portion, if any, lying outside of the Government meander line. Together with that portion of the east half of vacated Conrad Avenue adjoining, which attached thereto by operation of law; and together with that portion of Lot 4, Block 418, Seattle Tidelands, in King County, Washington, as shown on the Official Maps on file in the Office of the Commissioner of Public Lands at Olympia, Washington, lying south of the south line of Lot 9, Block 7, Sander's Second Addition to West Seattle, according to the plat thereof, recorded in Volume 3 of Plats, page 56, in King County, Washington, extended east.

 E. Commencement Date: The later of (a) the date of substantial completion (i.e., when the project architect certifies completion to the extent that the City may reasonably commence any work by the City and installation of the City's equipment, as conditioned in Section 12 hereof) of the tenant improvement work described in Exhibit B and the Final Plans approved by the City pursuant to Section 6 hereof or (b) the date of receipt by Landlord and City of a Temporary Certificate of Occupancy issued by The City of Seattle Department of Construction and Land Use with respect to the Premises, as modified by the tenant improvement work described in Exhibit B as approved by the City (in its capacity as Lessee rather than land use development regulator) pursuant to Section 6 hereof. If there shall be a delay in the occurrence of the Commencement Date of this Lease as a result of (i) the City's failure to approve any item or perform any other obligation of the City (as a Lessee and not as a governmental regulator) under Section 6 or Exhibit B in a timely manner; (ii) the City's request for materials, finishes or installations other than those readily available; (iii) the City's changes in Landlord's Work after approval by the City; (iv) the City's request to deviate from the Base Plans; or (v) the City's interference with Landlord's construction of the Landlord's Work or tenant improvements to be completed pursuant to Exhibit B; then the Commencement Date shall be accelerated by the number of days of such delay; provided the occurrence of more than one such delay-generating event shall not cause acceleration of the Commencement Date beyond the actual delay caused thereby to Landlord.

 F. Expiration Date: The end of the tenth (10th) year after the Commencement Date, unless the Term of this Lease is extended pursuant to Section 2 or this lease is terminated earlier pursuant to Section 25.

 G. Base Monthly Rent, Additional Rent, and City's Share of Operating Costs and Real Property Taxes Associated with Landlord's Property:

 (1) Initial Base Monthly Rent. The City shall pay rent to Landlord for use and occupancy of the Premises during the term hereof, as the initial Base Monthly Rent, the sum of One Dollar and No Cents ($1.00) per square foot for office space in the Building and Zero Dollars and Fifty-five Cents ($0.55) per square foot for warehouse/storage space in the Building.

 (2) CPI Adjustment of Base Monthly Rent. The Base Monthly Rent shall be adjusted every two (2) years, beginning on the second anniversary of the Commencement Date and continuing thereafter every two (2) years on such anniversary. Such adjustment shall equal the percentage increase (if any) that occurred during the preceding two (2) years in the Consumer Price Index ("CPI") for All Urban Consumer Items, Seattle-Tacoma-Bremerton Metropolitan Statistical Area using the base 1982-84 = 100, that is published by the U.S. Department of Labor, Bureau of Labor Statistics, or its successor for the month in which the Commencement Date occurs; Provided, that if there is no CPI published for the month when the first such adjustment is to be made, then the CPI for the immediately preceding month shall be used for such purpose; Provided, further, that in the event of any change in the index base (1982-84 = 100) or other modification of such index, the parties hereto shall apply whatever conversion factor(s) are necessary to establish the true percentage change in the CPI for any year(s) in which such modification(s) occur, and in the event such index is discontinued, the parties hereto shall select and use for such rent adjustment purpose, another, similar index that reflects consumer price changes. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, regardless of the actual biennial change in the CPI, the Base Monthly Rent or Adjusted Base Monthly Rent shall never be decreased, and any increase shall never exceed five percent ( +5%) of the then-current Base Monthly Rent or Adjusted Base Monthly Rent. To illustrate the parties' intentions under this subsection,

 (a) If the CPI index for the month in which the Commencement Date occurs equals 190.0, and for the month in which the second anniversary of the Commencement Date occurs equals 196.4, the percentage increase in the CPI between the Commencement Date and the second anniversary of the Commencement Date equals +3.4%, which, when applied to the Initial Base Monthly Rent of $1.00 for office space and $0.55 for warehouse/storage space, makes the Adjusted Base Monthly Rent payable from and after the second anniversary of the Commencement Date equals $1.03 for the office space and $0.57 for the warehouse/storage space;

 (b) If the CPI index for the month in which the second anniversary of the Commencement Date occurs equals 196.4, and for month in which the fourth anniversary of the Commencement Date occurs equals 207.3, the percentage increase in the CPI between the second anniversary and fourth anniversary of the Commencement Date equals +5.5%, which is a greater increase than the maximum biennial increase in the Adjusted Base Monthly Rent. In this circumstance the maximum biennial CPI adjustment (5%) would be applied to the then-current Base Monthly Rent of $1.03 for office space and $0.57 for warehouse/storage space to make the Adjusted Base Monthly Rent payable from and after the fourth anniversary of the Commencement Date equals $1.08 for office space and $0.60 for warehouse/storage space;

 (c) If the CPI index for the month in which the fourth anniversary of the Commencement Date occurs equals 207.3, and for month in which the sixth anniversary of the Commencement Date occurs equals 206.0, the CPI would have decreased between the fourth anniversary and the sixth anniversary of the Commencement Date. In this circumstance, because the Adjusted Base Monthly Rent can never decrease because of a change in the CPI, Adjusted Base Monthly Rent payable from and after the sixth anniversary of the Commencement Date shall remain the same as it was during the immediately preceding biennial period, namely, $1.08 for office space and $0.60 for warehouse/storage space.

 (3) Additional Rent and City's Share of Operating Costs and Real Property Taxes. The City shall also pay to Landlord Additional Rent as contemplated in Subsection 7.B and the City's Share of Operating Costs and Real Property Taxes associated with Landlord's Property as specified in Section 8 hereof.

 H. Security Deposit: None.

The City shall have the option to lease the premises described in the Bank's Lease upon the expiration or earlier termination of the Bank's Lease, under the terms and conditions of this lease including but not limited to the applicable Base Monthly Rent per square foot set forth in Subsection 1.G(1); provided, Landlord shall not be obligated to make any improvements to such Bank's premises or to provide any tenant improvement allowance to the City in connection with the exercise of such option, and Landlord shall provide the premises described in the Bank's Lease in a broom clean, AS-IS condition, as the same exists on the date the City's lease of such additional space commences. Such option shall be exercisable by the City within sixty (60) days after the City's receipt of Landlord's notice of the upcoming availability of such Bank premises, which notice shall be delivered not later than 115 days before the expiration of the term of the Bank's lease.

 5. PERMITTED USES & PURPOSES; USE OF ROOF & COMMON AREAS

 A. Generally Authorized Uses. The Premises shall be used for warehouse, equipment maintenance and repair, metal fabrication, painting, aggregation and temporary storage of Hazardous Substances pending transportation and disposal, ancillary general office activities, communications, and such other municipal purposes as the City may deem consistent therewith and do not interfere with the quiet and convenient enjoyment of the Landlord's Property by any other tenant of Landlord. The recitation of such allowed uses in this section shall not be deemed to be any warranty by Landlord of the suitability of the Landlord's Property or design of the Premises for such uses.

 B. Roof Use for Communications Equipment. The City shall have the right, at its own expense, and free from interference by Landlord or any other tenant, to install, keep in place, maintain, repair, upgrade and replace any communications and related equipment on the Landlord's Property, including any antennae, transmitters, receivers, transceivers, dishes, and related equipment, whether located on the roof of the Building or elsewhere, in compliance with applicable laws; provided, that any City installation on the roof shall not interfere with communications equipment installed on the roof by or for the Bank of America. If, at any time during the term of this lease, any City communications equipment is located on the roof of the Building, the City shall pay all costs incurred for maintenance of the portion of the roof so used including any access route thereto, and shall remove all such City equipment at the end of the term of this lease and repair and replace the roof membrane and coatings of the portion of the roof so used including any access route thereto as reasonably recommenced by Landlord's roofing consultant. Except as provided in this subsection and except as otherwise authorized by Landlord, Landlord reserves the exclusive right to use for any purpose whatsoever the roof of the Building, but shall ensure that no such use by Landlord or any other user besides the Bank of America interferes with any City communications equipment on the roof or the use of any such equipment. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, the City shall not be responsible or liable for the activities of Landlord or any other person on the roof.

 C. Other City-Authorized Premises Users. The City may permit other governmental agencies and community groups approved by the City to use and occupy the Premises under City supervision and control, for which expanded use the written consent of Landlord shall not be required; provided that the use of the Premises by any such other governmental agency or community group shall be restricted to uses of the sort authorized herein until such time as the City has leased all of Landlord's Property, i.e., the City is the only occupant of the Landlord's Property; provided further that the City shall make no use of the Landlord's Property except that which is consistent with the uses and character of the general neighborhood of the Landlord's Property.

 B. City Review of Plans & Specifications for Tenant Improvements. All plans and specifications for the tenant improvements to be made to the Premises pursuant to Exhibit B shall be subject to the review and approval of the City, in its role as lessee rather than as governmental regulator, prior to the Commencement Date. Landlord has engaged a project architect, as an independent contractor and not as Landlord's agent. Landlord and the City, with the assistance of the project architect shall work together to refine the draft plans and specifications generally approved by the parties prior to the execution of this Lease ("Base Plans") into final plans and specifications ("Final Plans") sufficient for construction by the contractor selected by Landlord, which refinement shall be an extension only of the Base Plans; the Final Plans shall not materially deviate from the Base Plans except as mutually agreed by Landlord and the City and changes or modifications required of all parties making comparable improvements by the governing jurisdictions issuing building and occupancy permits; any requirement or improvement beyond refinement of the Base Plans requested or required by the City (acting in its role as Lessee rather than as a governmental regulator) shall be deemed to be a change order by the City (hereinafter "change order") with an equitable adjustment of cost and time for performance in favor of Landlord and its contractor. The City shall complete its review the proposed Final Plans within two (2) weeks after receipt and give notice to Landlord indicating that the proposed plans and specifications are either accepted by the City as Final Plans or if they are not, what changes must be made in such plans and specifications in order to make them acceptable to the City; in the event that changes are so required, the City will complete any re-review as quickly as possible with the mutual goal of expediting the City's occupancy. The condition of all such tenant improvements upon their final completion shall also be subject to the review and approval of the City, in its role as lessee rather than as governmental regulator. The City shall commence its review of the condition of the Premises and the tenant improvement work undertaken by Landlord immediately after the City's receipt of Landlord's notice of substantial completion of such tenant improvements or of issuance of a Temporary Certificate of Occupancy.

 7. RENT & ADDITIONAL RENT

 A. Base Monthly Rent Inclusive of Compensation for Certain Tenant Improvements. The Base Monthly Rent rates specified in Subsection 1.G include compensation to Landlord for the City's use and occupancy of outside storage and vehicular parking areas on Landlord's Property (in common with all other tenants of Landlord's Property and not including use of parking denominated for the exclusive use of the Bank of America in its lease) as well as for Landlord's completion of all of the tenant improvements described in Exhibit B except the Specialized Improvements identified therein.

 B. Additional Rent. The City shall pay to Landlord Additional Rent equal to $47,793.82 per month for the satisfactory completion of the Specialized Improvements described in Exhibit B, which sum is the cost for such improvements as agreed upon by the parties hereto, namely $3,616,614.00, amortized (i.e., paid in equal monthly installments) over the ten (10)-year initial term at ten percent (10%) interest. Such Additional Rent shall not be subject to any CPI or other adjustment whatsoever. All changes in the cost of the Specialized Improvements shall be borne or enjoyed by Landlord except for the cost of changes that are requested by the City after the plans and specifications for the Specialized Improvements have been approved by the City pursuant to Subsection 6.B or the cost of City-requested change orders as defined in Subsection 6.B, which costs shall be separately paid by the City. The City may pay the unamortized balance of the cost of the Specialized Improvements at any time during the initial term of this lease, upon which payment the City's obligation to pay Additional Rent pursuant to this subsection shall cease. An illustrative amortization schedule is attached as Exhibit H.

 8. CITY'S SHARE OF OPERATING COSTS AND REAL PROPERTY TAXES ASSOCIATED WITH LANDLORD'S PROPERTY

 A. City Payments to be Based upon Landlord's Estimate; Adjustments to Payments. Landlord shall give notice to the City annually, on or by April 15th of each year during the term of this lease, of Landlord's reasonable estimate of the City's Share of Operating Costs and Real Property Taxes associated with Landlord's Property for that calendar year. The City shall pay as a fraction of the City's Share of such Operating Costs and Real Property Taxes based upon Landlord's estimate. The numerator in such fraction shall be one (1) and the denominator shall be the number of full months remaining in the calendar year from and after the date that the City received Landlord's estimate of the City's Share. Such payment shall be made monthly, in advance, on the first (1st) day of each month from and after the date the City received such notice; Provided, that if such notice was received by the City after the fifteenth (15th) day in the month of receipt, then the payment for the first month after the City's receipt of such notice shall be made on or by the thirtieth (30th) day after the City's receipt of such notice. After the end of each year during the term of this lease, but no later than April 15th of the next succeeding calendar year, Landlord shall compute the actual City's Share for the immediately preceding calendar year and deliver a notice to the City itemizing in reasonable detail all of the Operating Costs and Real Property Taxes and the difference, if any, between the aggregate amount previously paid by the City for such year and the amount due from the City for such year. If the actual City's Share for such year is greater than the aggregate amount already paid by the City for such year based upon Landlord's estimate, the City shall pay Landlord the deficiency within thirty (30) days after the City's receipt and approval of an invoice therefor. If the total amount paid by the City under this Subsection 8.A as Operating Costs and Real Property Taxes associated with Landlord's Property for any calendar year exceeds the actual City's Share for that year, then Landlord shall credit such excess to the payment of Base Monthly Rent, Additional Rent, and the City's Share of Operating Costs and Real Property Taxes thereafter coming due until such excess payment has been exhausted; Provided, however, if such excess payment has not been exhausted prior to the expiration or sooner termination of the lease term, Landlord shall refund such excess to the City unless such lease expiration or termination is because the City has exercised its option under this lease to purchase the Landlord's Property, in which case Landlord shall credit such excess against the Purchase Price as contemplated in Exhibit C.

 Landlord shall deliver the Premises to the City upon the Commencement Date, and the City shall accept possession of the Premises in substantially the condition the Premises have at the date of mutual execution of this lease, subject to Landlord's duty to complete the remainder of the tenant improvement work described in Exhibit B as provided herein. Notwithstanding any other provision hereof, the Commencement Date shall not occur until after all modifications to the Building that are to be made by Landlord under Exhibit B hereof and that pertain to the Premises' HVAC system, life/safety protection, security, and utilities have been completed and are fully operational. If the City moves into the Premises and commences operations thereon, the Commencement Date shall be deemed to have occurred on the date such operations commence. Upon such delivery of the Premises, the City shall inspect the same and, except for latent defects or deficiencies not readily discernable by inspection, shall be deemed to have accepted the Premises in their then-present condition unless the City notifies Landlord within seven (7) days after the completion of such inspection of any alleged defect(s) including punch list items; such inspection obligation of the City shall be limited to the tenant improvement work described herein to be performed by Landlord. Notwithstanding any provision to the contrary herein, the City's failure to include on the punch list any latent defect or other deficiency in the tenant improvement work performed by or for the Landlord that was not reasonably discernable shall not constitute the acceptance of such latent defect or other deficiency.

This right of access shall not be construed as an agreement on the part of Landlord to make any such repairs, additions or alterations. Landlord also reserves and shall have the right at all reasonable times during the City's business hours, after having given twenty- four (24) hours prior notice to the City, to enter the Premises during the last twelve (12) months of the Lease Term to show said Premises to prospective purchasers or tenants and to post "for lease" signs on the Premises. For each of the aforesaid purposes, Landlord shall at all times have and retain a key with which to unlock all of the doors in, upon and about the Premises, excluding the doors to the City's files, vaults and safes.

The City agrees to cooperate with Landlord to provide access to Bank of America as provided in the Fifth Amendment. Because Bank of America completed the initial excavation activities referenced in Subsection I of the Fifth Amendment prior to the date this lease is fully executed, Bank of America or Landlord shall give not less than forty-eight (48) hours prior written notice to the City of any anticipated access to the Premises desired by Bank of America or any officer, employee, agent, consultant or contractor thereof and shall describe in such notice the nature, extent and duration of all work to be undertaken on the Premises by or for Bank of America, and shall endeavor, in good faith, to undertake and complete all such work in a manner that does not interfere with the City's use of the Premises.

Landlord shall also provide to the Common Areas all reasonable utilities and services required therefor including but not limited to electricity, water and sewer, light bulb replacement, trash removal, landscaping, and such other services as are customarily provided in similar facilities in the locale of the Building, the charges for which shall be treated as an Operating Cost.

 B. Janitorial Services. The City shall secure and directly pay for whatever janitorial services are desired by the City with respect to the Premises.

 C. Interruption of Utility or Other Service.

If such interruption continues for more than three (3) days after notice of such interruption has been given to Landlord, and such interruption is substantially due to an act or omission of Landlord or any of its officers, employees or agents, the City shall have the right, after giving Landlord notice thereof, to attempt to repair the interruption, without liability to Landlord (except for the City's negligence). If the City attempts any such repair pursuant to this subsection, in addition to being able to abate the Base Monthly Rent or Adjusted Base Monthly Rent as provided herein, the City may offset the cost of such repair effort against any Base Monthly Rent or Adjusted Base Monthly Rent then due and payable or to become due and payable to Landlord.

 15. CARE OF PREMISES

 The City will not permit any waste, damage or injury to the Premises, use or permit in said Premises anything that will increase the rate of fire insurance thereon beyond that associated with the activities described in Section 5, or permit anything to be done upon said Premises that in any way will tend to create a public nuisance.

 16. MAINTENANCE - REPAIRS

 Except as otherwise provided for herein, Landlord shall keep and preserve Landlord's Property including but not limited to all structural and non-structural parts thereof, plumbing, and electrical, gas and other utility systems; and other equipment and appurtenances and the structure in which the Premises are located, in good order, condition and repair, whether such work is foreseen or unforeseen, ordinary or extraordinary.

Except as otherwise provided herein, the City shall keep and preserve, at the City's expense, the Premises and any equipment and appurtenances therein in good order, condition and repair, whether such work is foreseen or unforeseen, ordinary or extraordinary, but shall not be responsible for any repair or replacement that is the subject of any warranty or guarantee given by a third party to Landlord.

 17. DAMAGE OR DESTRUCTION

 If fifty percent (50%) or more of the Premises are damaged or destroyed to such an extent as to render the same unusable, then either party shall have the option to terminate this lease, which option shall be exercised by giving notice to the other party within 120 days after the date of such damage or destruction. If neither party elects to terminate the lease or if less than fifty percent (50%) of the Premises are damaged or destroyed, this lease shall continue in full force and effect and Landlord shall proceed as promptly as is practicable to restore the Premises to the condition the Premises were in immediately prior to such damage or destruction. If either party elects to terminate this lease, that party's notice of termination shall specify the date for termination of this lease, which date shall not be more than thirty (30) days after the giving of such notice, and upon the date so specified, the term of this lease shall expire as fully and completely as if such date were the date hereinabove set forth for the end of the term of this lease. Upon any such termination, the City shall vacate the Premises, without prejudice to any rights and remedies accrued to Landlord under this lease prior to such termination and any Base Monthly Rent, Additional Rent and City Share of Operating Costs and Real Property Taxes paid or payable by the City shall be adjusted as of the date of such termination. In the event Landlord elects or is required to repair, reconstruct and restore the Premises, during the period in which the Premises are rendered unfit for occupancy because of such casualty and such repairing, reconstructing and restoring, the Base Monthly Rent, Additional Rent and City Share of Operating Costs and Real Property Taxes to be paid under this lease shall be abated in the same ratio that the portion of the Premises rendered for the time being unfit for City use and occupancy bears to the whole of the Premises.

 For Landlord: For the City:

 20. INSURANCE

 A. Property Insurance. At all times during the term of this lease, Landlord shall maintain in force property insurance in the amount of not less than 100% of the full replacement cost of the Building and other improvements, fixtures and equipment that are a part of the Landlord's Property (exclusive of the cost of Building excavations, foundations and footings) and without deduction for physical depreciation, together with such other insurance coverage as is customarily carried on comparable buildings in the City of Seattle or as Landlord may reasonably determine. The replacement cost of the Building shall be reasonably determined by Landlord. Such insurance shall cover loss or damage from all perils included within the policy classification now known as "all risk" or "special cause of loss" including, without limitation, fire and extended coverage, vandalism, malicious mischief, sprinkler leakage, earthquake, flood, boiler and machinery insurance and special extended peril (all-risk). Such property insurance shall be in builder's risk form during construction of any modifications, alterations or additions to the Building or the Premises and during any restoration accomplished in connection with damage or destruction to the Premises or in connection with any condemnation of the Premises.

 B. Waiver of Subrogation Right. The parties agree to mutually waive all right of recovery against the other for any loss or damage covered by their respective property insurance policies for all perils insured thereunder and in the event of any insured loss, neither party's insurance carrier shall have a subrogation claim against the other party; provided, however, that this waiver of subrogation shall not apply if the effect is to void such insurance coverage.

 C. Coverage for Personal Property. Landlord shall have no obligation to insure any of the City's personal property or trade fixtures or repair, replace or restore the same if it is damaged or destroyed from any cause whatsoever.

 D. Landlord's Commercial General Liability Insurance.

 (d) For the commercial general liability insurance to be secured and maintained pursuant to Subsection 21.D hereof, a copy of the "Separation of Insureds" or "Severability of Interests" clause in such policy or an endorsement thereto indicating essentially that except with respect to the limits of insurance and any rights or duties specifically assigned to the first named insured, such insurance applies as if each named insured were the only named insured, and separately to each insured against whom any claim is made or suit is brought.

 (2) Pending receipt of the documentation specified in Subsection 21.F(1) hereof, a copy of each such policy's binder.

 (3) Within thirty (30) days after the receipt of a written request therefor, a complete copy of the requested policy with all endorsements thereto.

 21. SIGNS

 The City may place identification and directional signs upon the Premises to designate entrances, exits, and the location of various functions and activities on the Premises, all subject to the prior approval of Landlord, which shall not be unreasonably withheld.

 22. ALTERATIONS, ADDITIONS AND IMPROVEMENTS

 A. No Alteration, Addition or Improvement Without Landlord's Consent. The City shall not make or cause to be made any alteration, addition or improvement to the Premises without first obtaining the written consent of Landlord for such work, which shall not be unreasonably withheld. Any alteration, addition or improvement that is made solely for the convenience of the City or any of its employees or agents, or of the program to be conducted on the Premises shall be at the sole cost and expense of the City or the program being conducted on the Premises except for an alteration, addition or improvement occasioned by inherent damage or a latent defect in the Premises or of the structure in which the Premises are located, the cost of which alteration, addition or improvement shall be as agreed upon by the City and Landlord.

 B. Alterations, Additions & Improvements Made for Landlord's Convenience. Landlord shall pay the cost of all alterations, additions, and improvements initiated for Landlord's convenience, and save the City free and harmless from damage, loss or expense arising out of said alterations, additions and improvements performed by Landlord or on its behalf.

 23. EMINENT DOMAIN

 A. Total Taking. For purposes of this lease, a "Total Taking" occurs whenever (i) the entire Premises are taken or appropriated under the power of eminent domain by an entity other than The City of Seattle, or are transferred in lieu of the exercise of such power; or (ii) less than the entire Premises are taken or appropriated under the power of eminent domain by an entity other than The City of Seattle, or are transferred in lieu of the exercise of such power, and such taking, appropriation, or transfer materially interferes with the City's use of the remainder of the Premises. Upon the date of the taking of physical possession of the Premises under any Total Taking, the term of this Lease shall expire as fully and completely as if such date were the date hereinabove set forth for the expiration of the term of this lease. The City shall vacate the Premises on or by the date of the taking of physical possession of the Premises, without prejudice to any rights and remedies accrued to Landlord under this lease prior to such termination. The amount of Base Monthly Rent, Additional Rent or City Share of Operating Costs and Real Property Taxes paid or payable by the City shall be adjusted as of the date of the taking of physical possession of the Premises.

 B. Partial Taking. For the purposes of this lease, a "Partial Taking" occurs whenever there is a taking or appropriation of all or a portion of the Premises under the power of eminent domain by an entity other than The City of Seattle, or there is a transfer in lieu of the exercise of such power, and such taking, appropriation or transfer does not constitute a Total Taking. In the event of a Partial Taking, unless the City notifies Landlord within thirty (30) days of the date of such taking, appropriation or transfer that the City has reasonably determined that the portion of the Premises remaining is not adequate to enable the City to reasonably carry on the Permitted Use, this lease shall continue in full force and effect as to the portion of the Premises remaining; provided, however, that Landlord shall proceed as promptly as is practicable to restore the Premises to an architectural condition that is as comparable as possible to the condition the Premises had  immediately prior to such taking, appropriation or transfer. During the period between the date of the taking of physical possession by the condemning authority of a portion of the Premises and the date the remainder of the Premises are restored by Landlord as required by this subsection, Base Monthly Rent, Additional Rent and the City's Share of Operating Costs and Real Property Taxes shall be abated in the same ratio that the portion of the floor area of the Premises so taken bears to the entire floor area of Premises immediately prior to such taking, appropriation or transfer.

 C. Condemnation Award. The entire award for the taking under any right of condemnation or eminent domain or any transfer in lieu thereof shall belong to Landlord, and the City shall not be entitled to any part thereof or entitled to recover damages for the loss of its leasehold estate or other interest in the Premises. The City hereby assigns to Landlord all of the City's right, title and interest in and to any such award. The City shall have the right, however, to independently claim and recover from the condemning authority compensation for any loss to which the City may be put for the City's moving expenses or taking of the City's personal property (not including the City's leasehold interest), provided that such damages may be claimed only if they are awarded separately in the eminent domain proceedings and not out of or as part of the damages recoverable by Landlord. The City shall be entitled to any relocation assistance that an entity acquiring the Premises under eminent domain or in lieu of eminent domain is obligated to pay as a consequence of such acquisition.

 D. Repairs & Restoration After a Partial Taking Subject to City Approval. All repairs and other work to restore the Premises to the condition required by Subsection 25.B after a Partial Taking shall be made in accordance with plans and specifications approved by Landlord and the City, which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld.

 24. DEFAULT & TERMINATION

 A. Defaults Giving Cause for Termination. Notwithstanding any other provision herein, in the event that either party to this lease defaults in the performance of any of the terms, provisions, covenants and agreements to be kept, observed and performed by it and such default is not corrected within thirty (30) days after the receipt of notice thereof from the other party, or within ten (10) days in the event the default consists of the failure by the City to make a payment to Landlord, then the non-breaching party may, at its option, immediately terminate this lease, without notice or other proceedings, and in such event, Landlord may also re-enter and take possession of the Premises. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event a City default is other than the failure to pay any money due and owing to Landlord, if such default cannot reasonably be cured within the thirty (30) day period, the City shall not be in default if the City commences the cure within the thirty (30) day period and thereafter diligently pursues such cure to completion.

 B. City Remedies. If the Landlord defaults in the performance of any of its obligations under this lease and such default continues after the expiration of the cure period described in this lease, the City may exercise one or more of the following remedies:

 (1) Perform the Landlord's obligations hereunder, and offset the reasonable costs and expenses incurred by the City in doing so against the sums to be paid to the Landlord hereunder; or

 (2) Sue the Landlord for damages suffered by the City as a consequence of the Landlord's default; or

 (3) Sue the Landlord for specific performance.

 Notwithstanding any other provision of this lease, if Landlord's default renders all or a portion of the Premises untenantable for those uses contemplated by the City hereunder for more than thirty (30) days, the City shall be entitled to a fair and reasonable abatement of all sums due to the Landlord hereunder during the time that all or a portion of the Premises are so rendered unsuitable.

 25. FORCE MAJEURE

 Neither party shall be deemed in default hereof nor liable for damages arising from its failure to perform its duties or obligations hereunder if such is due to any cause beyond its reasonable control, including, but not limited to an act of Nature, act of civil or military authority, fire, flood, windstorm, earthquake, strike or labor disturbance, civil commotion, delay in transportation, order of a superior governmental entity, or war.

 26. SURRENDER OF PREMISES

 Upon the expiration or termination of this lease, including any extension thereof, whichever is earlier, the City shall quit and surrender said Premises and all keys thereto, without notice and in as good condition as received at the commencement of the term hereof except for ordinary wear and tear; damage or destruction by fire or other casualty; property damaged, removed, or destroyed by Landlord or its agents; latent defects or faulty construction of the structure of which the Premises comprise a part, not discoverable by inspection at the time of taking possession; and alterations, additions or improvements made to the Premises by the City. At the expiration or sooner termination of the lease term, the City shall return the Premises to Landlord in the same condition in which the Premises were received (or, if altered, then the Premises shall be returned in such altered condition), reasonable wear and tear excepted. Prior to such return, the City shall remove its moveable trade fixtures and appliances and equipment that have not been attached to the Premises, and shall repair any damage resulting from their removal.

 27. ASSIGNMENT BY LANDLORD

 If Landlord sells or otherwise transfers the Landlord's Property, or if Landlord assigns its interest in this lease, other than an assignment solely for security purposes or a transfer in foreclosure or a deed in lieu of foreclosure, such purchaser, transferee, or assignee thereof shall be deemed to have assumed Landlord's obligations under this lease arising after the date of such transfer, and this lease shall remain in full force and effect. The City shall attorn to Landlord's successor.

 28. ASSIGNMENT & SUBLETTING BY THE CITY

 The City may assign its interest in this lease or sublet the whole or any portion of the Premises to any person or entity without the prior consent of Landlord, but the City shall remain primarily liable for the performance of all obligations of the City under this lease in the event of any such assignment or sublease without Landlord's prior consent; provided, (i) any unexercised option to renew or extend the term of this lease shall be deemed terminated and (ii) no change of the allowed uses of the Premises shall occur. If, however, Landlord is requested to give its consent to any assignment of the City's interest in the lease and such consent is granted, then the assignee shall become primarily liable for the performance of all of the City's obligations under this lease. The granting of consent to a given transfer shall not constitute a waiver of the consent requirement as to future transfers. In lieu of giving its consent, Landlord shall have the right to terminate the lease as to the portion of the Premises affected by the action for which Landlord's consent is requested and recover possession thereof from the City within thirty (30) days following written notice thereof to the City.

 29. SUBORDINATION & ATTORNMENT

 A. City to Attorn to Holder of Landlord's Mortgage. At the option of Landlord, this lease shall be subject and subordinate to the lien of any mortgages or deeds of trust in any amount or amounts whatsoever that now or hereafter are placed on or against the Landlord's Property or improvements or either thereof, of which the Premises are a part, or on or against Landlord's interest or estate therein ("Landlord's Mortgage"). The City shall subordinate its interest in this lease and its option to purchase the Landlord's Property to the holder of any Landlord's Mortgage, and attorn to the holder of any Landlord's Mortgage or any person or persons purchasing or otherwise acquiring the Building or the Premises at any sale or other proceeding under any Landlord's Mortgage if each such holder of Landlord's Mortgage executes with the City a Subordination, Non-Disturbance, Estoppel & Attornment Agreement substantially in the form of Exhibit D, attached. The City covenants and agrees to execute and deliver upon demand, without charge therefor, such further instruments evidencing such subordination of this lease to the lien of any mortgages or deeds of trust as may be reasonably required by Landlord.

 B. Estoppel Certificate.

 (a) The City shall at any time upon not less than ten (10) days prior notice from Landlord execute, acknowledge and deliver to Landlord a statement in writing (i) certifying that this lease is unmodified and in full force and effect (or, if modified, stating the nature of such modification and certifying that this lease, as so modified, is in full force and effect) and the date to which the Base Monthly Rent and other charges are paid in advance, if any, and (ii) acknowledging that there are not, to the City's knowledge, any uncured defaults on the part of Landlord hereunder, or specifying such defaults if any are claimed. Any such statement may be relied upon by any prospective purchaser or encumbrancer of the Premises.

 (b) The City's failure to deliver such statement within such time shall be conclusive upon the City (i) that this lease is in full force and effect, without modification except as may be represented by Landlord, (ii) that there are no uncured defaults in Landlord's performance, and (iii) that not more than one month's Base Monthly Rent has been paid in advance.

 30. LATE CHARGE; INTEREST.

 Time is of the essence of this Lease. If Tenant fails to pay any amount due hereunder within five (5) days of the due date, a late charge equal to five percent (5%) of the unpaid amount shall be assessed and be immediately due and payable. Such late charge shall be reimposed on the first day of each subsequent month that such payment remains outstanding. In addition, interest shall accrue from the date due until paid at the rate of eighteen percent (18%) per year, or the maximum legal rate of interest, whichever is less.

 31. LIENS AND ENCUMBRANCES.

 Tenant shall keep the Premises free and clear of all liens and encumbrances arising out of or relating to work, labor, services, equipment or materials supplied or claimed to have been supplied to the Premises at the request of Tenant, or anyone holding all or any portion of the Premises through Tenant. If any lien is filed against the Premises Tenant shall give Landlord immediate notice of the filing and shall cause the lien to be discharged within 10 days after Landlord's demand. If Tenant fails to discharge such lien within such period, in addition to any other right or remedy Landlord may have, after five days prior written notice to Tenant, Landlord may, but shall not be obligated to, discharge the lien by paying to the claimant the amount claimed to be due or by procuring the discharge in any other manner that is now or may in the future be permitted by law. Any amount paid by Landlord, together with all costs, fees and expenses in connection therewith (including Landlord's reasonable Attorneys' Fees, together with interest thereon at the Agreed Rate, shall be repaid by Tenant to Landlord on demand by Landlord. Tenant shall indemnify and defend Landlord against all losses, costs, damages, expenses (including reasonable Attorneys' Fees), liabilities, penalties, claims, demands and obligations, resulting from such lien.

 32. NOTICES

 Any notice, demand or request required hereunder shall be in writing and delivered to the party's address set forth in Subsections 1.I or 21.E hereof by any of the following means: (a) personal service; (b) commercial or legal courier; or (c) registered or certified, first class mail, postage prepaid, return receipt requested. Such addresses may be changed by notice to the other parties given in the same manner as above provided. Notices shall be deemed to have been given upon the earlier of actual receipt, as evidenced by the deliverer's affidavit, the recipient's acknowledgment of receipt, or the courier's receipt, except in the event of attempted delivery during the recipient's normal business hours at the proper address by an agent of a party or by commercial or legal courier or the U.S. Postal Service but refused acceptance, in which case notice shall be deemed to have been given upon the earlier of the day of attempted delivery, as evidenced by the messenger's affidavit of inability to deliver stating the time, date, place and manner in which such delivery was attempted and the manner in which such delivery was refused, or on the day immediately following deposit with such courier or, if sent pursuant to subsection (c), forty-eight (48) hours following deposit in the U.S. mail.

 33. NO RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN LANDLORD & CITY CREATED BY LEASE

 In no event shall the City be construed or held to have become in any way or for any purpose a partner, associate, or joint venturer of Landlord or any party associated with Landlord in the conduct of Landlord's business or otherwise. This lease does not constitute Landlord as the agent or legal representative of the City for any purpose whatsoever.

 34. BROKERAGE FEES

 36. AMENDMENTS

 The parties hereto expressly reserve the right to renegotiate any and all of the provisions hereof from time to time as may be necessary and to amend this lease accordingly; Provided, however, that no alteration or modification of the terms or conditions hereof shall be valid and binding unless made in writing and signed by the authorized representative of the parties hereto.

 37. NO WAIVER OF DEFAULT; NO LIEN

 No covenant, term or condition or the breach thereof shall be deemed waived, except by written consent or acknowledgment of the party against whom the waiver is claimed. No waiver of the breach of any covenant, term or condition shall be deemed to be a waiver of any preceding or succeeding breach of the same or any other covenant, term or condition. Acceptance by Landlord of any performance by the City after the time the same shall have become due shall not constitute a waiver by Landlord of the breach or default of any covenant, term or condition unless otherwise expressly agreed to by Landlord in writing. The City does not waive full compliance with the terms and conditions of this lease by the payment of Base Monthly Rent, Additional Rent, or the City's Share of Operating Costs and Real Property Taxes. Landlord acknowledges that the property of the City cannot be subjected to any lien whatsoever.

All recording and miscellaneous charges associated with conveyance of the Property or Roy Street Shops that are customarily attributable to purchasers in similar transactions shall be paid by the grantee. The grantor shall pay all other excise taxes that are due and payable in connection with the conveyances contemplated under this Agreement.

 B. PRORATIONS

 All prorations shall be made as of 12:01 a.m. on the Closing Date so that for purposes of prorations, (i) Buyer shall be deemed in ownership of the Property throughout such day, and (ii) if Seller gave notice pursuant to Section 10 of the City Lease that Seller will accept the Roy Street Shops in partial consideration for the sale of the Property to Buyer, Seller shall be deemed in ownership of the Roy Street Shops throughout such day. Unless otherwise specified herein, all matters shall be prorated on an accrual basis.

 (1) As used herein, "Taxes" include all real and personal property taxes and similar charges of any kind. All delinquent Taxes (including penalties thereon) shall be paid at Closing out of funds due Seller. Any non-delinquent Taxes shall be prorated based on the current tax bill; if such tax bill has not yet been received by a party, the proration shall be based on one hundred percent (100%) of the previous year's tax bill, and the parties shall make any necessary adjustment after the Closing when the actual current bill is available. If any additional or supplemental Taxes are assessed against the Property or, if Seller gave notice pursuant to Section 10 of the City Lease that Seller will accept the Roy Street Shops in partial consideration for the sale of the Property to Buyer, then the Roy Street Shops, for back assessments, corrections to previous tax bills or other events occurring before the Closing Date, the parties shall make necessary adjustments after Closing. All assessments levied against the Real Property for improvements that are payable in installments shall be prorated as to the current installment. Any delinquent assessment together with any penalties and interest thereon shall be paid on or before the Closing Date by the party responsible for such payment.

 (2) As used herein "Operating Expenses" include all costs incurred in operating the Property in the normal course of business in a manner similar to the operation of similar properties in the area, including, without limitation, utility charges, common area maintenance costs, management fees and charges under service contracts. All Operating Expenses shall be prorated on an accrual basis. Seller shall be credited, and Buyer shall be debited, with the amount of all refundable cash or other refundable security deposits posted with any governmental authority, utility company or similar third party.

Any Rents due but unpaid as of the Closing shall be considered delinquent. All delinquent Rents shall be prorated by the parties as of the Closing, but not until they are actually collected. Buyer shall use commercially reasonable efforts to collect any delinquent Rents after the Closing, but shall not be obligated to institute suit or terminate a Tenant's right of occupancy. After the Closing, Seller shall not take any action against a Tenant owing delinquent Rents that would affect such Tenant's right to occupy its leased premises. Seller shall not be entitled to any Rents received from Tenants after the Closing unless such Tenants are current in their Rents for periods occurring from and after the Closing. In the event Seller receives any payment of Rents from any Tenant subsequent to the Closing, such payments shall be endorsed in favor of Buyer and immediately delivered to Buyer. All delinquent Rents collected by Buyer, net of costs of collection, shall be applied first against any amount then currently due and then to amounts most recently overdue. Rents that have not been paid and that are applicable to the calendar month in which the Closing occurs shall be prorated as of the Closing Date with Buyer receiving credit against the Purchase Price for its share of the Rents. After such proration, Seller shall be entitled to retain the Rents for the current month, and if such payment is received by Buyer, Buyer shall promptly remit such payment to the Seller. Any Tenant Deposit or prepaid Rents shall be retained by Seller and the amount thereof credited to Buyer.

 (4) As used herein, "Commissions" includes all leasing commissions, finder's fees and similar payments arising in connection with the Leases.

 9. SECTION 1031 OR 1033 EXCHANGE

 Seller intends for this transaction to be tax deferred under IRC Section 1033 or a part of a Section 1031 like-kind exchange. If Seller gives such notice to Buyer of such intention; Buyer shall reasonably cooperate in such tax deferral or the completion of the like-kind exchange so long as Buyer incurs no additional liability in doing so and any expenses (including attorneys' fees and cost) incurred by the Buyer that are related only to the exchange are paid or reimbursed to the Buyer at or prior to Closing.

 10. DAMAGE TO PROPERTY/TAKINGS

 A. DAMAGE TO PROPERTY

 If the Property or any part thereof (i) is materially damaged by casualty, or (ii) is taken or is the subject of a notice of taking by eminent domain prior to the Closing Date, Seller shall promptly notify Buyer. Within thirty (30) Days after such notice, Buyer shall give notice that it elects to (a) terminate this Agreement, in which event the parties shall have no further obligations hereunder; or (b) proceed to Closing, in which event Seller shall assign to Buyer all insurance proceeds attributable to the Property arising from the casualty, together with a credit against the Purchase Price equal to the deductible amount and/or coinsurance amount under the applicable insurance policy, or pay over and assign to Buyer all awards recovered or recoverable on account of such taking, as the case may be. If Buyer elects to proceed under Subsection 10.A(b), Seller shall not compromise, settle, or adjust any claims to such proceeds, or awards without Buyer's prior written consent. If Seller's notice of damage or condemnation is given within ten (10) Days prior to the Closing Date, the Closing shall be delayed for up to an additional three (3) Days, at Buyer's option.

 B. DAMAGE TO THE ROY STREET SHOPS

 If Seller gave notice pursuant to Section 10 of the City Lease that Seller will accept the Roy Street Shops in partial consideration for the sale of the Property to Buyer and the conveyance of the Roy Street Shops to Seller is to occur at Closing, and if the Roy Street Shops or any part thereof (i) is materially damaged by casualty, or (ii) is taken or is the subject of a notice of taking by eminent domain prior to the Closing Date, Buyer shall promptly notify Seller. Within thirty (30) Days after such notice, Seller shall give notice that it elects to

 (a) terminate the arrangement under which the Roy Street Shops Value is to be credited against the Purchase Price, in which event the Buyer shall have no further obligations to Seller with respect to the Roy Street Shops; or

 (b) proceed to Closing, in which event Buyer shall assign to Seller all insurance proceeds attributable to the Roy Street Shops arising from the casualty, together with a credit against the Roy Street Shops Value equal to the deductible amount and/or coinsurance amount under the applicable insurance policy, or pay over and assign to Seller all awards recovered or recoverable on account of such taking, as the case may be. If Seller elects to proceed under Subsection 10.B(b), Buyer shall not compromise, settle, or adjust any claims to such proceeds, or awards without Seller's prior written consent. If Buyer's notice damage or condemnation is given within ten (10) Days prior to the Closing Date, the Closing shall be delayed for up to an additional three (3) Days, at Seller's option.

 11. SURVIVAL OF TERMS

 All representations, warranties and indemnification commitments by the respective parties contained herein are intended to and shall remain true and correct as of the Closing, shall be deemed to be material, and shall not be merged into any deed, and shall survive the delivery of such deed and transfer of title.

 12. SUCCESSORS AND ASSIGNS

 The terms, covenants and conditions herein contained shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the successors and assigns of the parties hereto. Buyer may assign Buyer's rights and obligations hereunder; such assignment shall be effective as a release of Buyer from the obligations hereunder, provided that the assignee of Buyer's rights and obligations accepts such rights and obligations.

 13. DEFAULTS & REMEDIES

 In the event that either party defaults in the performance of any of its obligations under this Agreement, the other party may give notice thereof to the party allegedly in default, specifying the reasonable time within which such default shall be remedied. The parties agree that if either party defaults in the performance of its obligations under this Agreement, and such default is not cured by the party given notice of default within the time specified in such notice, the actual damages suffered by the party giving such notice will be extremely difficult to calculate and determine, that specific performance of the parties' respective obligations hereunder is the preferred remedy for a default, and that in the absence thereof, liquidated damages as stated herein are the parties' best estimate of the amount of damages that the party giving such notice would suffer as a consequence of such default. Accordingly, in the event of any default by Seller regarding conveyance of the Property or, if Seller gave notice pursuant to Section 10 of the City Lease that Seller will accept the Roy Street Shops in partial consideration for the sale of the Property to Buyer, Seller's acquisition of the Roy Street Shops, Buyer shall be entitled to specific performance. In the event of any default by Buyer regarding conveyance of the Roy Street Shops or the purchase of the Property, Seller shall be entitled to specific performance. If, for any reason, the conveyance of the Property or the Roy Street Shops does not close as contemplated herein, the City Lease shall remain in effect.

 14. ATTORNEYS' FEES

 In the event of any dispute (whether or not litigation is involved) regarding any party's rights or obligations under this Agreement, each party shall be responsible for its own attorneys' fees and court costs.

 15. NOTICES

 All notices required or permitted to be given pursuant to the terms hereof shall be in writing and shall be delivered either by hand delivery; by overnight delivery service; by deposit in the United States mail, registered or certified mail, postage prepaid; or by electronic facsimile transfer, but if delivered by electronic facsimile transfer, a hard copy of such notice shall also be delivered on or before the next day by hand delivery or by overnight delivery service. All notices shall be addressed to Seller at Seller's Address (or in the case of an electronic facsimile transfer, to Seller's facsimile copier number); and to Buyer at Buyer's Address (or in the case of an electronic facsimile transfer, to Buyer's facsimile copier number). The addresses (and electronic facsimile transfer numbers) set forth in Section 1 may be changed by written notice to the other party as provided herein. Notices shall be deemed to have been given upon the earlier of actual receipt, as evidenced by the deliverer's affidavit, the recipient's acknowledgment of receipt, or the overnight delivery service's receipt; and in the event of attempted delivery during normal business hours at the proper address by an agent of a party or by the overnight deliver service or the U.S. Postal Service but refused acceptance, shall be deemed to have been given upon attempted delivery, as evidenced by an affidavit of inability to deliver stating the time, date, place and manner in which such delivery was attempted and the manner in which such delivery was refused.

 16. CONSTRUCTION OF DOCUMENT

 In construing this document, all headings and titles are for the convenience of the parties only and shall not be considered a part of this Agreement. Whenever required by the context, the singular shall include the plural and the masculine shall include the feminine and vice versa.

Upon receipt of such notice, the affected party shall be excused from such performance as is affected by the Force Majeure Event for the period of such Event. If the period of non- performance exceeds fifteen (15) days from the receipt of notice of the Force Majeure Event, the party whose ability to perform has not been so affected may terminate this Agreement by giving notice of such termination to the other party. If such Event shall affect the Closing Date, the Closing Date shall automatically be extended for a period equal to the duration of such Event.

 19. APPLICABLE LAW

 This Agreement shall be governed by the laws of the State of Washington.

 20. NO ORAL MODIFICATION OR WAIVER This Agreement may not be changed or amended orally, but only by an agreement in writing. No waiver shall be effective hereunder unless given in writing, and waiver shall not be inferred from any conduct of either party.

 (d) agree that such purchaser shall not be bound to exhaust its recourse or take any action against the City or against any other person or entity (including any other Guarantor) before proceeding against any Guarantor hereunder.

 From: The City of Seattle, a first class city of the State of Washington("Tenant")

 Lease Dated: ____________ Lease Term: ________________

 W I T N E S S E T H:

 WHEREAS, the Tenant has entered into a lease dated ___________________ 20___ (the "Lease") with Patton Westbridge LLC, a Washington limited liability company, and Westbridge LLC, a Washington limited liability company, as equal tenants in common, whose interest is held by Landlord, covering premises (the "Premises") described in Exhibit "A" attached hereto and incorporated herein by reference; and

 WHEREAS, the Lender has agreed to make a loan of * ($ * ) to the Landlord secured by a Deed of Trust, hereinafter referred to as "mortgage" (which mortgage also secures any future advances made by Lender); provided, however, that said Lease is subordinate to the lien of the mortgage. The mortgage was recorded on _______ ____________, 20__, under _________ County Auditor's file no. ____________; and

 WHEREAS, Lender has been requested by Tenant and by Landlord to enter into a non-disturbance agreement with Tenant, and the terms of the Lease requires execution of a non-disturbance agreement as a, condition of Tenant's subordination;

 NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the promises and mutual covenants hereinafter contained, the parties hereto mutually covenant and agree as follows:

 The Lease and any extensions, renewals, replacements or modifications thereof, and all of the right, title and interest of the Tenant in and to said Premises, including but not limited to any option or right of first refusal to purchase Premises, or any acquisition of title to the Premises by Tenant during the term of the mortgage, are and shall be subject and subordinate to the mortgage and to all of the terms and conditions contained herein, and to any renewals, modifications, replacements, consolidations and extensions of the indebtedness secured thereby.

 Lender consents to the Lease and, in the event of foreclosure of said mortgage, or in the event Lender comes into possession or acquires title to the Premises as a result of the enforcement or foreclosure of the mortgage or mortgage note, or as a result of any other means, Lender agrees to recognize Tenant as such and further agrees that Tenant shall not be disturbed in its possession of the Premises for any reason other than one that would entitle the Landlord to terminate the Lease under its terms or would cause, without further action by such Landlord, the termination of the Lease or would entitle such Landlord to dispossess the Tenant from the Premises.

 Tenant agrees with Lender that if the interests of Landlord in the Premises shall be transferred to and owned by Lender by reason of foreclosure or other proceedings brought by it, or by any other manner, Tenant shall be bound to Lender under all of the terms, covenants and conditions of the Lease for the balance of the term thereof remaining and any extensions or renewals thereof, if exercised, that may be affected in accordance with any option therefor in the Lease, with the same force and effect as if Lender were the Landlord under the Lease, and Tenant does hereby attorn to Lender as its Landlord, said attornment to be effective and self- operative without the execution of any further instrument on the part of any of the parties hereto immediately upon Lender succeeding to the interest of the Landlord in the Premises. Tenant agrees, however, upon the election of and written demand by Lender after Lender receives title to the Premises, to promptly execute an instrument in confirmation of the foregoing provisions, reasonably satisfactory to Lender, in which Tenant shall acknowledge such attornment and shall set forth the terms and conditions of its tenancy.

 Tenant agrees with Lender that if Lender shall succeed to the interest of Landlord under the Lease, Lender shall not be (a) liable for any action or omission of any prior landlord under the Lease, except for outstanding maintenance and repair obligations for conditions that remain in existence after Lender has succeeded to the interest of Landlord; or (b) subject to any offsets or defenses that Tenant might have against any prior landlord; or (c) bound by any rent or additional rent that Tenant might have paid for more than one month in advance to any prior landlord; or (d) bound by any amendment or modification of the Lease made without Lender's consent after the date hereof, or (e) bound by any provision in the Lease that obligates the Landlord to erect or complete any building or to perform any construction work or to make any improvements to the Premises, other than the work items identified on Tenant's punch list and Landlord's maintenance, repair, compliance with laws, damage, and condemnation obligations under the Lease. Tenant further agrees with Lender that Tenant will not voluntarily subordinate the Lease to any lien or encumbrance without Lender's consent after the date hereof

 In the event that the Landlord shall default in the performance or observance of any of the terms, conditions or agreements in the Lease, Tenant shall give written notice thereof to the Lender and the Lender shall have the right (but not the obligation) to cure such default. Tenant shall not take any action with respect to such default under the Lease, including and without limitation, any action in order to terminate, rescind or void the Lease or to withhold any rental thereunder for a period of ten (10) days after receipt of such written notice thereof by the Lender with respect to any such default capable of being cured by the payment of money and for a period of thirty (30) days after receipt of such written notice thereof by the Lender with respect to any other such default; provided, that in the case of any default that cannot be cured by the payment of money and cannot with diligence by cured within such thirty (30) day period because of the nature of such default or because Lender requires time to obtain possession of the Premises in order to cure the default, if Lender shall proceed within such thirty (30) day period to attempt to obtain possession of the Premises, where possession is required, and to cure the same and thereafter shall prosecute the curing of such default with diligence and continuity, then the time within which such default may be cured shall be extended for such period as may be necessary to complete the curing of the same with diligence and continuity. Notwithstanding the foregoing, whenever Landlord and Lender have been given notice of a default with respect to a Landlord obligation under Section 6 of the Lease and an emergency creating a threat of danger to life, limb or property exists as a consequence of such default and will be exacerbated by the continuation of such emergency condition for the ten (10) or thirty (30) day periods provided for herein, then Tenant shall have the authority, acting on behalf of Landlord and Lender, to effect an emergency cure of such Landlord's default and to offset the cost thereof against any sum then or thereafter due and owing to Landlord.

 Except for transfers in accordance with the Lease, Tenant agrees with Lender that Tenant's estate in the Premises shall not be conveyed or encumbered without the written consent of the Lender so long as the Lease is in effect.

 Landlord and Tenant hereby covenant and agree with Lender as follows:

 a. The Lease has been properly executed and delivered by Tenant, is valid and binding upon Tenant, has not been modified except as set forth herein, and is in full force and effect;

 b. There exist no defaults under the terms of the Lease by Landlord or Tenant except: ______________;

 c. Tenant has not paid any rental to Landlord more than one month in advance and Landlord holds no security deposit for Tenant;

 d. Tenant, in its capacity as such and not as governmental regulator or otherwise, has no current defense, claim of lien or offset, under the Lease or against the rental payable thereunder, except _________________ and;

 e. Tenant in its capacity as such and not as governmental regulator, utility service provider, or otherwise, has no claims to or interest in the Premises, legal or equitable, or any contract or option therefor except the option under the Lease to purchase certain property including the Premises.

 This Agreement shall bind and inure to the benefit of all parties hereto, their successors and assigns. As used herein the term "Tenant" shall include the Tenant, its successors and assigns; the words "foreclosure" and "foreclosure sale" as used herein shall be deemed to include the acquisition of Landlords' estate in the Premises by voluntary deed (or assignment) in lieu of foreclosure, and the word "Lender" shall include the Lender herein specifically named and any of its successors and assigns, including anyone who shall succeed to Landlord's interest in the Premises by, through or under foreclosure of the mortgage.

 This Agreement shall not be modified or amended except in writing signed by the parties hereto.

 The use of the neuter gender in this Agreement shall be deemed to include any other gender, and words in the singular number shall be held to include the plural, when the sense requires.

 Notwithstanding any of the other provisions hereof, this Agreement is not intended to create and shall not be deemed to create any personal liability on the part of Tenant for repayment of the loan secured by the mortgage.

 Lender shall not join Tenant as a party defendant in any action or proceeding foreclosing any of the mortgage unless such joinder is necessary to foreclose such mortgage and then, only for such purpose and not for the purpose of terminating the Lease, but Lender shall give notice to Tenant of the commencement of any such proceeding, regardless of whether or not such joinder is necessary.

 This Agreement is made and executed under and in all respects is to be governed by and construed under the laws of the State of Washington.

 Any notice, demand or request required hereunder shall be in writing and delivered to the party's address set forth below by any of the following means: (a) personal service; (b) commercial or legal courier; or (c) registered or certified, first class mail, postage prepaid, return receipt requested.
