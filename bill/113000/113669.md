 WHEREAS, streamflows in the Skagit and Pend Oreille rivers have continued to decline in the current water year and are now expected to be at the lowest levels ever recorded; and

 WHEREAS, as a result of deteriorating water conditions the Department will be required to buy additional power in the wholesale market at high prices; and

 WHEREAS, the Bonneville Power Administration is expected to increase the rates that will be in effect under its new contract with City Light effective October 1, 2001 to a level far in excess of the rates assumed in the Department's 2001 budget; and

 WHEREAS, the Department has contracted with the City of Klamath Falls for the purchase of 100 MW of power from the Klamath Falls Cogeneration Project, beginning on July 1, 2001; and

 WHEREAS, the Department intends to sign a multi-year contract for the purchase of up to 100 MW of additional power, with delivery of power under this contract to begin in 2001; and

 WHEREAS, Resolution 30256 requires the Department to mitigate fully the greenhouse gas emissions related to its purchase of power from the Klamath Falls Cogeneration Project; and

 WHEREAS, the Department has contracted with Oregon Climate Trust Consulting Services for greenhouse gas mitigation; and

 WHEREAS, the Department plans to acquire an additional 1.7 average MW of conservation savings by implementing the "10 plus 10" Incentive Program; and

 WHEREAS, the Council has increased rates by authorizing power cost adjustments effective January 1, 2001 and March 1, 2001, and the Department has proposed a third power cost adjustment to become effective July 1, 2001; and

 WHEREAS, the amount of utility tax payable by the Department to the City will be higher than anticipated due to the increase in revenue resulting from the power cost adjustments; and

 WHEREAS, none of the developments cited above were anticipated at the time the Council adopted the 2001 Budget for the City Light Department; and
