 AN ORDINANCE relating to drivers with suspended licenses whose cars are impounded; authorizing and directing the development of a "Safe Ride" program, which may include the Executive Services Department entering into new contracts; and transferring expenditure authority from the 2000 Department of Finance General Jail Services budget to the 2000 budget of the Executive Services Department to pay for costs associated with this effort.

 WHEREAS in 1998 the City Council passed Ordinance 119180 allowing the impoundment of vehicles driven by persons arrested for driving while license suspended or revoked in the first, second, or third degree; and

 WHEREAS persons whose cars are impounded for driving while license suspended may be at risk if they lack the means to obtain transportation from the place of impoundment, in part because the impoundment occurs while the person is in route; and

 WHEREAS providing transportation to these persons in this situation would reduce fear and protect public safety; NOW, THEREFORE,

 BE IT ORDAINED BY THE CITY OF SEATTLE AS FOLLOWS:

 Section 1. The Executive Services Department is authorized and directed to work with the Police Department to develop a program, to be known as "Safe Ride," to offer and arrange taxi rides for drivers of and passengers in vehicles impounded pursuant to SMC 11.30.105. The general purpose of the program shall be to provide a means for police officers to obtain prompt taxi service for persons whose vehicles are impounded in route and who do not have taxi fare or an alternative means of transportation, contingent on the availability of program funds. The program shall be for the remainder of the year 2000. The Executive Services Department shall determine the conditions and limitations on the City's provision of full or partial payment for taxi rides, including but not limited to the number of destinations for occupants of a single vehicle, the nature and geographic limits of destinations, the maximum miles or price for which the City will pay, and the number of rides that will be provided to an individual. The Executive Services Department may provide the service through an amendment to its existing contracts or may negotiate and enter into one or more new agreements for these services.

 Section 2. In order to support the costs of providing the taxi service described in section 1, the Executive Services Department's 2000 expenditure authority is increased as follows:

 Department Fund Program Category Amount

 Executive Services 50380 A85 $25,000

 by the appropriation, hereby made and authorized, of the sum of Twenty-five Thousand dollars ($25,000) from the General Subfund. To provide the necessary funds for these expenditures, the appropriation in the 2000 budget of the Department of Finance General for Jail Services (Summit Code Q523600) is reduced by a like amount, and that amount is re-appropriated as set out in this section.

 Section 3. This ordinance shall take effect and be in force thirty (30) days from and after its approval by the Mayor, but if not approved and returned by the Mayor within ten (10) days after presentation, it shall take effect as provided by Municipal Code 1.04.020.
