The proposition shall be limited so that the City shall not levy more than Twenty-three Million Dollars ($23,000,000) in the first year, with that limit increasing annually by three and one-tenth percent (3.1%) compounded annually, in addition to the maximum amount of regular property taxes it could have levied consistent with Chapter 84.55 RCW in the absence of this ordinance. Pursuant to RCW 84.55.050(4), the maximum regular property taxes that may be levied in 2008 for collection in 2009 and in later years shall be computed as if the limit on regular property taxes had not been increased under this ordinance.

 Section 3. Use of Funds. Proceeds and interest earnings from the additional taxes levied pursuant to this ordinance shall be applied as follows:

If all of the projects in an Acquisition or Development subcategory have been completed or deleted, or their estimated levy contributions shown in Attachment A have been fully expended, and additional taxes collected under this ordinance (and any interest earnings thereon) that were allocated to that subcategory according to Attachment A remain unexpended, then those proceeds and earnings shall be added to the Acquisition and Development Opportunity Fund category.
