 ORDINANCE __________________

 AN ORDINANCE relating to land use and zoning, amending Sections 23.50.012 and 23.50.027 of the Seattle Municipal Code to provide an exception from industrial size of use limits in IG1 zones for office uses in public facilities operated for public purposes by units of special or general purpose government or the City.

 NOW THEREFORE, BE IT ORDAINED BY THE CITY OF SEATTLE AS FOLLOWS:

 Section 1. Subsection C of Section 23.50.012 of the Seattle Municipal Code (SMC), which Section was last amended by Ordinance 119370, is hereby amended as follows:

 SMC 23.50.012 Permitted and prohibited uses.

 C. Public Facilities.

 1. Except as provided in subsections C2~~a~~ and C~~2b~~3 below and in Section 23.50.027, uses in public facilities that are most similar to uses permitted outright or permitted by conditional use in this chapter shall also be permitted outright or by conditional use, subject to the same use regulations, development standards and administrative conditional use criteria that govern the similar uses.

 2. Public Facilities Not Meeting Development Standards Requiring City Council Approval.

~~a.~~ The City Council may waive or modify applicable development standards or conditional use criteria for those uses in public facilities that are similar to uses permitted outright or permitted by conditional use according to the provisions of Chapter 23.76, Subchapter III, Council Land Use Decisions, with public projects considered as Type IV quasi- judicial decisions and City facilities considered as Type V legislative decisions.

 3. Other Uses Permitted in Public Facilities. Unless specifically prohibited, uses in public facilities that are not similar to uses permitted outright or permitted by a conditional use under this chapter may be permitted by the City Council. City Council may waive or modify development standards or conditional use criteria according to the provisions of Chapter 23.76, Subchapter III, Council Land Use Decisions, with public projects considered as Type IV quasi-judicial decisions and City facilities considered as Type V legislative decisions.

 4. In all industrial zones, uses in public facilities not meeting development standards may be permitted by the Council if the following criteria are satisfied:

 a. The project provides unique services which are not provided to the community by the private sector, such as police and fire stations; and

 b. The proposed location is required to meet specific public service delivery needs; and

 c. The waiver or modification to the development standards is necessary to meet specific public service delivery needs; and

 d. The relationship of the project to the surrounding area has been considered in the design, siting, landscaping and screening of the facility.

 5. Expansion of Uses in Public Facilities.

 a. Major Expansion. Major expansions may be permitted to uses in public facilities allowed in subsections C1, C2~~a~~ and C~~2b~~3 above according to the same provisions and procedural requirements as described in these subsections. A major expansion of a public facility use occurs when the expansion that is proposed would not meet development standards or exceed either seven hundred fifty (750) square feet or ten (10) percent of its existing area, whichever is greater, including gross floor area and areas devoted to active outdoor uses other than parking.

 b. Minor Expansion. When an expansion falls below the major expansion threshold level, it is a minor expansion. Minor expansions may be permitted to uses in public facilities allowed in subsections C1, C2~~a~~ and C~~2b~~3 above according to the provisions of Chapter 23.76, Procedures for Master Use Permits and Council Land Use Decisions, for a Type I Master Use Permit when the development standards of the zone in which the public facility is located are met.

 6. Essential Public Facilities. Permitted essential public facilities shall also be reviewed according to the provisions of Chapter 23.80, Essential Public Facilities.

 Section 2. Subsections A and C of Section 23.50.027 of the SMC, which Section was last amended by Ordinance 119370, is hereby amended as follows:

 SMC 23.50.027 Maximum size of nonindustrial use.

 A. Applicability.

Except as provided in subsections B, C and D of this section below, the maximum size of use limits specified in Chart A of this section shall apply to uses on a lot, and the total gross floor area occupied by uses limited under Chart A of this section shall not exceed an area equal to the area of the lot in an IG1 zone, or two and one-half (2.5) times the area of the lot in an IG2, IB or IC zone, or three (3) times the lot area in IC zones in the South Lake Union Planning Area, as identified in Exhibit 23.50.028 A , with sixty-five (65) foot or eighty-five (85) foot height limits. The size of use limits apply to principal and accessory uses on a lot. The limits shall be applied separately to the two (2) categories of use listed in Chart A of this section.

 2. The maximum size of use limits shall not apply to the area identified in Exhibit 23.50.027 A provided that no single retail establishment shall exceed fifty thousand (50,000) square feet in size.

 (( ~~b. T~~the office is a principal use on the same or another lot within one (1) mile distance of a permitted use not listed in Chart A and is directly related to and supportive of that use.

~~(2)~~(b) The likelihood that the proposed use will provide or encourage improvements that will directly support industrial activity in the area;

~~(3)~~(c) The likelihood that the proposed use, because of its type, size and location, will operate without substantial conflicts with the industrial function of the area;

~~(4)~~(d) A sufficiently large industrial area such that the proposed use would not undermine the area's industrial character.

~~b.~~ (2) Characteristics that make a lot less appropriate for office uses are:

~~(1)~~(a) The presence of heavy industrial uses which would conflict with office use;

~~(2)~~(b) The presence of any special features, such as access to the water, rail and the regional highway systems, which make the land especially well- suited to industrial use.

The Director may permit office uses in public facilities operated for public purposes by units of special or general purpose government or the City on lots zoned IG1 to exceed the size of use limits referenced in Chart A as a special exception pursuant to Chapter 23.76, Master Use Permits and Council Land Use Decisions if:  a.

The total gross floor area to be devoted to office use will not exceed the lesser of (1) fifty-five percent (55%) of the gross floor area of the existing structures on the lot; (2) fifty-five percent (55%) of the gross floor area of the proposed structures on the lot; or (3) an area equal to the area of the lot;

 d. At least fifty percent (50%) of the gross floor area of structures existing on the lot has been vacant for at least two (2) years prior to September 1, 1999;

 (2)

At least twenty-five percent (25%) of the gross floor area of the existing structures on the lot must have previously functioned as one or more of the following uses or categories of uses and at least twenty-five percent (25%) of the gross floor area of proposed structures on the lot must function as one or more of the following uses or categories of uses:  a) Major or minor vehicle repair;

 b) Warehouse;

 e) High-impact uses;
