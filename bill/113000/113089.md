 PLANS, APPROVALS, FINANCING AND CONSTRUCTION

 Section 301. Design and Schematic Plans

 Purchaser represents, warrants and agrees that it shall develop the Parcel and construct the Improvements thereon in substantial conformity with the Schematic Plans, all applicable state and local laws and regulations, and the objectives of the Twelfth Avenue Plan. If so requested by the Director, the Purchaser agrees to attend one or more community meetings with regard to the Schematic Plans.

 Section 302. Construction Plans and Specifications

 Purchaser shall prepare plans and specifications with respect to the construction of Improvements ("Construction Plans") in substantial conformity with the previously approved Schematic Plans, this Agreement and all applicable state and local laws and regulations and in sufficient completeness and detail for issuance of a building permit for the Improvements by the DCLU.

As a condition precedent to the City's obligations hereunder, a building permit for construction of the Improvements must be issued by DCLU no later than 450 days from execution of this Agreement.

 Purchaser shall submit the Construction Plans to DON simultaneously with their submission to DCLU. Within fifteen (15) days of receipt, the Director of DON shall review Construction Plans solely for the purpose of determining whether they are in substantial conformity with the approved Schematic Plans. If the Director determines that, in comparison to the Schematic Plans, the Construction Plans show a decrease by fifteen percent (15%) or more in the number of on-site parking spaces, number of residential units or square footage of retail space , the Director shall so notify Purchaser in writing, providing a statement of reasons for his rejection of the submitted Construction Plans. In such event, Purchaser may submit a revised set of Construction Plans for review by the Director in accordance with this paragraph. If the Director does not approve Construction Plans (either upon initial submission or revision), then either the City or Purchaser may terminate this Agreement by notice to the other party and the Escrow Agent, in which case the Earnest Money shall be retained by the City as liquidated damages, as the City's sole and exclusive remedy, and neither party shall have any further liability or obligation, of any kind whatsoever, to the other under this Agreement.

 If any transmittal of the Construction Plans contains conspicuous notice on the first page thereof of the time limit for DON review and if, within fifteen (15) days of receipt, the Director does not give Purchaser notice of any changes in the Construction Plans required for conformity with the Schematic Plans, then the Construction Plans shall be deemed approved.

 Purchaser shall submit Construction Plans to DCLU and DON within one hundred eighty (180) days of execution of this Agreement. If Construction Plans conforming to this Agreement are not submitted within such period, the City shall have the right, by notice to Purchaser and Escrow Agent, to terminate this Agreement, in which case the Earnest Money shall be retained by the City as liquidated damages, as the City's sole and exclusive remedy.

 Section 303. Changes in Construction Plans or Schematic Plans

 If Purchaser desires to make any changes to the Schematic Plans, or any material changes to the Construction Plans that would result in the Construction Plans not substantially conforming to the Schematic Plans approved by the Director, Purchaser shall submit the proposed change to the Director. If the Director finds that the Construction Plans and/or Schematic Plans as modified by the proposed change will fulfill the objectives of 12th Avenue Plan and materially conform to Schematic Plans, the Director shall approve the proposed change and evidence his approval by endorsement of the same on the revised plan sheets and by notifying the Purchaser and the DCLU Director in writing of his approval.

 If the Director finds that the proposed changes to the Construction Plans and/or Schematic Plans will not fulfill the objectives of the 12th Avenue Plan and/or do not materially conform to approved Schematic Plans, the Director, in the exercise of his reasonable discretion, may reject the proposed changes.

 Changes in the Construction Plans and/or Schematic Plans shall be approved or rejected in whole or in part, by written notice from the Director to the Purchaser within fifteen(15) days of submittal by the Purchaser. If the City does not give notice of any required changes in Schematic Plans or Construction Plans within thirty(30) days of receipt thereof, and if the transmittal of such plans contained conspicuous notice on the first page thereof of the time limit for review hereunder, then the changed plans shall be deemed approved by the Director.

 If the Director rejects the proposed changes, the Purchaser may, within fifteen (15) days, submit a revision of the proposed changes, which the Director shall review within fifteen (15) days of receipt. The Director shall inform Purchaser of the Director's approval or rejection of the revision. If the Director rejects the proposed revision, he may terminate this Agreement by notifying Purchaser and Escrow Agent in writing. In such event, this Agreement will terminate, the City shall retain the Earnest Money as the City's sole and exclusive remedy, and neither party shall have any further liability or obligation, of any kind whatsoever, to the other under this Agreement. If the revision of the Construction Plans contains conspicuous notice on the first page thereof of the time limit for DON review and if, within fifteen (15) days of receipt, the Director does not give Purchaser notice of approval or rejection, then the revision to the Construction Plans shall be deemed to be approved.

 Section 304. Financing

 Purchaser represents that Purchaser has in effect a letter of interest from U.S. Bank of Washington, (the "Lender") for financing the acquisition and construction of site improvements of the type contemplated by this Agreement, under which the Lender will issue a financing commitment upon completion and approval of an underwriting process. Purchaser shall, within one hundred twenty (120) days after the date hereof, apply to Lender for a financing commitment on the Parcel, and shall diligently seek to obtain that commitment in an amount necessary to fund the purchase and construction contemplated hereby. As a condition to City's obligations hereunder, Purchaser shall provide DON, no later than two hundred forty (240) days after date hereof, a financing commitment from the Lender or another construction lender reasonably satisfactory to the Director (either, the "Primary Construction Lender") that demonstrates to the reasonable satisfaction of the Director that Purchaser will obtain all financing necessary to complete the Improvements in accordance with this Agreement, the Schematic Plans, the MUP and the 12th Avenue Plan, and that no term of the financing commitment is in conflict with the terms of Agreement, the Schematic Plans, the MUP or the 12th Avenue Plan. If Purchaser fails to submit such commitment by such date, then the City may, by notice to Purchaser, terminate this Agreement, in which case the Earnest Money shall be returned to Purchaser and neither party shall have any liability hereunder. If the City does not give notice to Purchaser within fifteen (15) days after receipt of a copy of the financing commitment that any terms thereof do not meet the criteria set forth in this Section 304, then the City shall be deemed to have approved the terms thereof.

 Section 305. Time for Construction

 Purchaser agrees that it shall commence construction of the Improvements within sixty (60) days after Closing and diligently proceed to complete construction of the Improvements. Completion of the Improvements (as evidenced by the City's issuance of a Certificate of Occupancy) shall occur no later than five hundred forty (540) days after Closing. The work shall at all times be subject to inspection by DCLU.

 Section 306. Report on Progress

 Subsequent to the conveyance of the Parcel to the Purchaser and until construction of the Improvements is complete, the Purchaser shall, within ten (10) days of any request by the City, forward to the Director a report in writing as to the actual construction progress.

 Section 307. Purpose of Review of Plans

 Review by DON of Schematic Plans and Construction Plans is for the purpose of assuring that the Improvements further community development objectives and assuring conformity with the terms of this Agreement. Such review by DON shall not be construed as a representation or warranty to Purchaser or any third party that the plans and specifications are adequate for any purpose, that there has been or will be compliance on the part of any contractor or subcontractor with the plans and specifications, that construction has been or will be free from faulty material or workmanship, or as to any other matter. Purchaser shall cause this Section 308 to be included in any contract for work into which Purchaser shall enter under this Agreement.

 Section 308. Certificate of Occupancy

 Promptly after issuance by DCLU of a Certificate of Occupancy with regard to the Improvements and delivery of a copy of such certificate to DON, the deposit shall be returned to Purchaser or the bond provided by Purchaser shall be exonerated unless the City has already exercised its right to retain the Deposit for a breach or default on the part of Purchaser.

 Section 310. Limitation on Use of Hazardous Substances

 Purchaser shall not use, or allow any agents, contractors, or subcontractors to use the Parcel to generate, manufacture, refine, transport, treat, store, handle, recycle, release or dispose of Hazardous Substances, except as may be reasonably necessary for Purchaser's development of the Parcel. All hazardous material used and stored on or about the Property shall be used and stored in compliance with all applicable local, state and federal environmental, health and safety laws and regulations.

 REGULATORY CONDITIONS

 Section 401. Women's and Minority Business Enterprise

 Because this contract does not involve a public work or consultant services to the City, or the use of City funds, the minimum set-aside provisions of SMC Chapter 20.46A do not apply. Nonetheless, in connection with the construction of the Improvements, Purchaser shall:

 (1) Fulfill any women's business enterprise and minority business enterprise participation commitments submitted to the City;

 (2) Continue to make affirmative efforts to utilize women's business enterprises and minority business enterprises;

 (3) Require contractors and subcontractor(s) to represent that they will make affirmative efforts to utilize women's business enterprises and minority business enterprises;

 (4) Maintain records reasonably necessary for monitoring compliance with the requirements of this Section.

 Section 402. Permits

 Nothing in this Agreement is intended or shall be construed to require that the City exercise its discretionary authority under its regulatory ordinances to further the development of the Parcel, nor binds the City to do so. The City will process applications for permits as if such applications were made in the absence of this Agreement.

 PROHIBITIONS AGAINST ASSIGNMENT AND TRANSFER

 Section 501. Use of Improvements

 Purchaser represents and agrees that the purchase of the Parcel is for the purpose of immediate development of a mixed commercial and residential complex and not for speculation in land holding.

 Section 502. Prohibition Against Transfer of Parcel and Assignment of Agreement.

 Purchaser represents and agrees that:

 A. Purchaser has not made or created or suffered to be made or created any assignment, conveyance, mortgage, lease, trust, power or transfer, of any sort, of this agreement or any interest herein, or any interest in or relating to the Parcel, or entered into any agreement or contract to do any of the foregoing and (except as authorized by Sections 601-605 and 814 herein) Purchaser shall not do any of the foregoing prior to issuance of a Certificate of Occupancy without the prior written approval of the City, which may be withheld in the City's sole discretion; provided that this Subsection A does not apply to leases of space within the Improvements to tenants.

 B. In order to request City approval for any transaction of the type referenced in Subsection A above, Purchaser shall submit to the City all documents relating to the proposed transactions and such information concerning the proposed transferee as the City shall request. If the City approves the transaction, as a condition of such approval, the transferee shall assume all obligations of Purchaser hereunder and shall agree to comply with such other conditions the City may find desirable in order to achieve and safeguard the purposes of this Agreement. This Subsection B shall not apply to mortgages or deeds of trust granted to the Primary Construction Lender as authorized in Section 601 below.

 C. In the absence of specific written agreement by the City to the contrary, no transfer or approval thereof by the City shall be deemed to relieve Purchaser, or any other party bound in any way by this Agreement or otherwise with respect to the construction of the Improvements, from any of its obligations with respect thereto.

 MORTGAGE FINANCING; RIGHTS OF MORTGAGEES

 Section 601. Limitation Upon Encumbrance of Parcel

 Prior to the issuance of a Certificate of Occupancy for the Improvements, the Purchaser shall not engage in any financing or any other transaction creating any mortgage or other encumbrance or lien upon the Parcel without the express written consent of the Director, except for financing documents substantially as contemplated in a financing commitment from the Primary Construction Lender, approved or deemed approved by the City pursuant to Section 304 hereof, for acquisition of the Parcel and construction of the Improvements (the "Approved Financing").

 The Purchaser shall notify DON in advance of any proposed financing other than the Approved Financing, secured by mortgage or other similar lien instrument, that Purchaser proposes to enter into with respect to the Parcel, or any part thereof (the "Proposed Financing"), and in any event Purchaser shall promptly notify DON of any encumbrance or lien that has been created on or attached to the Parcel, whether by voluntary act of the Purchaser or otherwise. If the terms of the Proposed Financing are reasonably satisfactory to the Director, considering the criteria set forth in Section 304 hereof, the City shall, at or after Closing hereunder, join in the execution of the mortgage or deed of trust for the sole purpose of subordinating the City's possibility of reverter (as described below) to the lien of such instrument, but with any liability of the City or its officers expressly disclaimed.

 Section 602. Mortgagee Not Obligated to Construct

 Notwithstanding any of the provisions for the Agreement, the holder of any mortgage authorized by the Agreement (including any such holder who obtains title to the Parcel or any part thereof as a result of foreclosure proceedings, or action in lieu thereof) shall in no case be obligated by the provisions of the Agreement to construct or complete the Improvements or to guarantee such construction or completion; nor shall any covenant or any other provision in the Deed be construed to so obligate such holder; provided, that nothing in this Section or any other Section or provision of the Agreement shall be deemed or construed to permit or authorize any such holder to devote the Parcel or any part thereof to any uses, or to construct any improvements thereon, other than those uses or improvements provided or permitted in the 12th Avenue Plan.

 Section 603. Copy of Notice of Default to Mortgagee

 Whenever the City shall deliver any notice or demand to the Purchaser with respect to any breach or default by the Purchaser in its obligations or covenants under the Agreement, the City shall at the same time forward a copy of such notice or demand to each holder of any mortgage authorized by the Agreement which holder has been identified to the City in writing by Purchaser, at the last address of such holder shown in the records of the City.

 Section 604. Mortgagee's Option To Cure Defaults

 After any breach or default referred to in Section 603 hereof, each such holder shall (insofar as the rights of the City are concerned) have the right, at its option, to cure or remedy such breach or default and to add the reasonable cost thereof to the mortgage debt and the lien of its mortgage: Provided, that if the breach or default is with respect to construction of the Improvements, nothing contained in the Agreement shall be deemed to permit or authorize such holder to undertake or continue the construction or completion of Improvements on the Parcel (beyond the extent necessary to conserve or protect improvements or construction already made) except for completion of the Improvements substantially as provided pursuant to this Agreement. In the case of any breach or default occurring after Purchaser shall have acquired the Parcel and shall have granted a mortgage or deed of trust in favor of the Primary Construction Lender, the Primary Construction Lender shall have an additional 30 days to cure such breach or default after the expiration of any cure period allowed to Purchaser, and if the breach or default cannot reasonably be cured within such 30-day period then the additional period of cure allowed to the Primary Construction Lender shall be extended for such time as is reasonably required to cure such breach or default, provided that the Primary Construction Lender shall give notice of its intent to cure and commence cure within such 30-day period and continue diligently to pursue such cure.

 Section 605. Mortgage and Holder

 For the purposes of the Agreement: The term "mortgage" shall include a deed of trust or other instrument creating an encumbrance or lien upon the Parcel, or any part thereof, as security for a loan. The term "holder" in reference to a mortgage shall include any insurer or guarantor of any obligation or condition secured by such mortgage or deed of trust.

 DEFAULT AND REMEDIES

 Section 701. In General

 Except as otherwise provided in this Agreement, in the event of any default in or breach of this Agreement, or any of its terms or conditions, by any party hereto, or any successor to a party, such party (or successor) shall, upon written notice from the other, proceed immediately to cure or remedy such default or breach, and, in any event, shall complete such cure within sixty (60) days after receipt of such notice or such shorter period as may be provided herein. In case such action is not taken or not diligently pursued, or the default or breach shall not be cured or remedied within the time permitted hereunder, the aggrieved party may pursue any remedies available at law or in equity, subject to the specific limitations herein.

 Section 702. Termination By Fault of City Prior to Conveyance of Parcel

 In the event that any of the following occurs prior to conveyance of the Parcel:

 A. The City fails to tender conveyance of the Parcel in the manner required herein after satisfaction of the conditions provided in this Agreement and notice to close from Purchaser as specified herein, and any such failure shall not be cured within sixty (60) days after notice from the Purchaser; or

 B. DON fails or refuses to approve Purchaser's Construction Plans pursuant to the terms of this Agreement without a statement of reasons for such refusal; or

 C. The City otherwise fails or refuses to carry out the terms and conditions of this Agreement prior to Closing;

 then, at the option of Purchaser and following the notice and cure period specified in Section 701, this Agreement shall be terminated by written notice thereof to the City, Purchaser shall receive a full refund of the Earnest Money and Purchaser shall have the right, as its sole remedy, to proceed against the City for actual damages limited to out-of-pocket costs directly related to development of the Parcel. As used throughout this Agreement, the term "out-of-pocket costs" includes documented project management costs, not to exceed $200,000, that are incurred from date of this Agreement and are directly related to the development of the Parcel but excludes indirect administrative or overhead costs and also excludes consequential damages of any kind whatsoever, such as but without limitation lost profits, lost business opportunities or interference with business or contractual expectancies.

 Section 703. Termination by Fault of Purchaser Prior to Conveyance of Parcel

 In the event that any of the following occurs prior to the conveyance of the Parcel:

 A. Purchaser (or any successor in interest) assigns or attempts to assign this Agreement or any rights therein or in the Parcel without the express consent of the City; or

 B. Purchaser does not submit Construction Plans as required by this Agreement or obtain necessary permits to allow construction in the manner and by the dates respectively provided in this Agreement, and such failure shall not be cured within thirty (30) days after the date of written demand by the City, which cure period shall be extended for up to sixty (60) days in the case of failure to obtain permits if the Purchaser demonstrates to the satisfaction of the City that it has used all reasonable diligence to obtain such permits and that additional time is required; or

 C. Purchaser, without legal excuse, gives notice that it will be unable or unwilling to close the Purchase as provided herein; or

 D. Purchaser, without legal excuse, does not tender the full consideration for and take title to the Parcel, and perform all other obligations of Purchaser at Closing upon tender of conveyance by the City pursuant to this Agreement; or

 E. Purchaser, without legal excuse, fails to give written notice of intent to close pursuant to Section 7.A of Part I hereof at least ten (10) days in advance of the last date for closing specified in such Section, notwithstanding the satisfaction of all conditions to Purchaser's obligation to close except those to be satisfied at Closing; or

 F. Purchaser, without legal excuse, otherwise fails to comply with the terms of this Agreement prior to Closing; or

 G. Purchaser fails to close on another parcel of property under another Contract for Sale of Land with the City within the period specified in such Contract, without reasonable cause or without written notice to the City reasonably in advance of the expiration of such period; or there are multiple failures by Purchaser to comply in material respects with the terms or conditions of the land sale contracts with the City, if such failures are not promptly corrected to the satisfaction of the City;

 then, at the option of the City and following the notice and cure periods specified in Section 701, this Agreement and any rights of Purchaser or of any assignee or transferee in this Agreement or arising therefrom with respect to the City or the Parcel shall be terminated, and unless the sole ground for termination is item G above, the Earnest Money shall be retained by the City as liquidated damages, as the sole and exclusive remedy available to the City, and neither Purchaser (or assignee or transferee) nor the City shall have any further rights against or liability to the other under this Agreement. If the sole ground for termination is item G above, then the Earnest Money under this Agreement shall be returned to Purchaser and neither Purchaser (or assignee or transferee) nor the City shall have any further rights against or liability to the other under this Agreement.

 Section 704. Reversion of Title to City Upon Failure to Commence Construction or Complete Improvements or Certain Other Events Subsequent to Conveyance to Purchaser

 A. The City is selling the Parcel for the purpose of the immediate construction improvements as outlined in the Schematic Plans and in reliance on the representation of Purchaser that such Improvements will be constructed. Therefore, as set forth in the Deed, the conveyance of the Parcel to Purchaser shall be subject to a condition subsequent that shall remain in effect until receipt by the DON of a Certificate of Occupancy for the Improvements, to the effect that in the event of failure to commence construction of or complete the Improvements pursuant to the Agreement, or upon the occurrence of other events described therein prior to completion of the Improvements, and after failure on the part of Purchaser to cure or remedy such failure or other event within the period (if any) and in the manner stated in the Deed, the City at its option may declare a termination of all the rights and interests in and to the Parcel conveyed by the Deed to Purchaser, and that such title and interests to and in the Parcel shall vest in the City, upon which all rights of Purchaser (and all persons claiming through Purchaser) in and to the Parcel and possession thereof shall cease; provided, that such condition subsequent and any reverting of title as a result thereof in the City (1) shall always be subordinate to and limited by, and shall not defeat, render invalid, or limit in any way, (i) the lien of any mortgage authorized by the City pursuant to this Agreement, and (ii) any rights or interests provided in this Agreement for the protection of the holders of such mortgages; and (2) shall not apply to the Parcel once the Improvements to be constructed have been completed in accordance with this Agreement and the Certificate of Occupancy has been issued.

 B. If the City exercises its right to revest title to the City pursuant to this section, the City shall return to Purchaser, without interest, all funds paid by Purchaser to the City for the Parcel, after deducting (1) any amounts used to pay off liens incurred or permitted by Purchaser, (2) City expenses related to this transaction, and (3) any amount by which the appraised value of the Parcel at the time of reversion to the City is exceeded by the price paid by Purchaser.

 C. In addition to, and not in the alternative to, the City's power of termination and possibility of reverter as provided for above, the City shall have the right, at any time when the City would have the right to declare a termination of Purchaser's interest under the terms of the Deed, by notice to Purchaser and Escrow Agent, to elect to retain the Deposit without any deduction, offset or recoupment whatsoever, as liquidated damages in the event of default, violation or failure of the Purchaser as specified in this section. If the City makes such election to retain the Deposit or realize on the bond, then Purchaser shall have an additional ninety (90) days beyond the deadline otherwise applicable to remedy the failure or event giving rise to the City's right to terminate Purchaser's interest, prior to effectiveness of any termination.

 Section 705. Other Rights and Remedies of City; No Waiver of Delay

 Either party shall have the right to institute such actions or proceedings as it may deem desirable for effectuating its remedies. Any delay by either party in instituting or prosecuting any such actions or proceedings or otherwise asserting its rights under this Agreement shall not operate as a waiver of any rights or remedies or to deprive it of or limit such rights or remedies in any way; nor shall any waiver in fact made with respect to any specific default be considered or treated as a waiver of the rights or remedies of either party with respect to any other defaults or with respect to the particular default except to the extent specifically waived in writing.
