 1003.2.1 Use.

 1003.2.1.1 General. The building official shall assign a use category as set forth in Table 10-A to all portions of a building. When an intended use is not listed in Table 10-A, the building official shall establish a use based on a listed use that most nearly resembles the intended use.

 1003.2.1.2 Change in use. No change in use or occupancy shall be made to any existing building or structure unless the means of egress system is made to comply with the requirements of this chapter for the new use or occupancy. See Section 3405.

 1003.2.2 Occupant load.

 1003.2.2.1 General. The basis for the design of the means of egress system is the occupant load served by the various components of such system.

 1003.2.2.2 Determination of occupant load. Occupant loads shall be determined in accordance with the requirements of this section.

 1003.2.2.2.1 Areas to be included. In determining the occupant load, all portions of a building shall be presumed to be occupied at the same time.

 EXCEPTION: Accessory use areas that ordinarily are used only by persons who occupy the main areas of an occupancy shall be provided with means of egress as though they are completely occupied, but their occupant load need not be included when computing the total occupant load of the building.

 Interpretation I1003.2a: Accessory use areas may include foyers, corridors, halls, toilet facilities, file rooms, storage rooms, closets, stairways, elevator enclosures and other service facilities.

 Interpretation I1003.2b: In places of worship containing social halls, occupant load for the purpose of determining occupancy group may be computed as the sum of the areas reasonably expected to be occupied at one time, including principal worship area and classrooms or instructional areas, and principal worship area and social hall, and social hall and classrooms or instructional areas. Exits shall be computed on total capacity.

 1003.2.2.2.2 Areas without fixed seats. For areas without fixed seats, the occupant load shall not be less than the number determined by dividing the floor area under consideration by the occupant load factor assigned to the use for such area as set forth in Table 10-A.

 The occupant load for buildings or areas containing two or more uses or occupancies shall be determined by adding the occupant loads of the various use areas as computed in accordance with the applicable requirements of Section 1003.2.2.2.

 Where an individual area has more than one proposed use, the occupant load for such area shall be determined based on that use that yields the largest occupant load.

 1003.2.2.2.3 Areas with fixed seats. For areas having fixed seats, the occupant load for such areas shall be determined by the number of fixed seats installed therein.

 For areas having fixed benches or pews, the occupant load shall not be less than the number of seats based on one person for each 18 inches (457 mm) of length of pew or bench. Where fixed booths are used in dining areas, the occupant load shall be based on one person for each 24 inches (610 mm) of booth length. Where fixed benches, pews or booths are curved, the larger radius shall determine the booth length.

 1003.2.2.2.4 Outdoor areas. The occupant load of yards, patios, courts and similar outdoor areas shall be assigned by the building official in accordance with their anticipated use. Such outdoor areas accessible to and usable by the building occupants shall be provided with a means of egress as required by this chapter. Where an outdoor area exits only through a building, the occupant load of such outdoor area shall be considered in the design of the means of egress system of that building.

 1003.2.2.2.5 Reviewing stands, grandstands and bleachers. The occupant load for reviewing stands, grandstands and bleachers shall be calculated in accordance with Section 1003.2.2.2 and the specific requirements contained in Section 1008.

The width, in inches (mm), of any component in the means of egress system shall not be less than the product determined by multiplying the total occupant load served by such component by the applicable factor set forth in Table 10-B. In no case shall the width of an individual means of egress component be less than the minimum required for such component as specified elsewhere in this chapter.

 Where more than one exit or exit-access doorway serves a building or portion thereof, such calculated width shall be divided approximately equally among the means of egress components serving as exits or exit-access doorways for that area.

 1003.2.3.3 Maintaining width. If the minimum required width of the means of egress system increases along the path of exit travel based on cumulative occupant loads served, such width shall not be reduced or otherwise diminished to less than the largest minimum width required to that point along the path of exit travel.

 EXCEPTION: In other than Group H, Divisions 1, 2, 3 and 7 Occupancies, the width of doors from an exit enclosure may be based on the largest occupant load of any level served by such exit enclosure multiplied by a factor of 0.2 (5.08).

 1003.2.3.4 Exiting from adjacent levels. No cumulative or contributing occupant loads from adjacent building levels need be considered when determining the required width of means of egress components from a given level.

 Where an exit enclosure from an upper floor and a lower floor converge at an intermediate floor, the width of the exit from the intermediate floor shall be based on the sum of the occupant loads of such upper and lower floors.

 1003.2.3.5 Two-way exits. Where exit or exit-access doorways serve paths of exit travel from opposite directions, the width of such exit or exit-access doorways shall be based on the largest occupant load served. Where such exit or exit-access doorways are required to swing in the direction of exit travel by Section 1003.3.1.5, separate exit width for each path of exit travel shall be provided based on the occupant load of the area that is served.

 1004.3.2.3.2 Seat spacing. Where seating rows have 14 or less seats, the minimum clear width of aisle accessways shall not be less than 12 inches (305 mm) measured as the clear horizontal distance from the back of the row or guardrail ahead and the nearest projection of the row behind. Where seats are automatic or self-rising, measurement may be made with the seats in the raised position. Where seats are not automatic or self-rising, the minimum clear width shall be measured with the seat in the down position.

 The clear width shall be increased as follows:

 1. For rows of seating served by aisles or doorways at both ends, there shall be no more than 100 seats per row. The minimum clear width of 12 inches (305 mm) for aisle accessways shall be increased by 0.3 inch (7.6 mm) for every additional seat beyond 14, but the minimum clear width need not exceed 22 inches (559 mm). If the aisles are dead-ended, see Section 1004.3.2.4 for further limitations.

 Section 42. Section 1206.7 of the 1997 Seattle Building Code, as adopted by Ordinance 119079, is amended as follows:

 Section 1206.7 Sound Transmission Control Systems. Generic systems as listed in the Fire Resistance Design Manual, Thirteenth Edition, dated April 1992, as published by the Gypsum Association may be accepted where a laboratory test indicates that the requirements of Section 1206 are met by the system.

 VIAQ: RADON RESISTIVE CONSTRUCTION STANDARDS.

 (a) General. The criteria of this section establish minimum radon resistive construction requirements for all Group R Occupancies.

 (b) Crawl Spaces. All crawl spaces shall be ventilated as specified in Section 2306.7

 If the ventilation openings in a crawl space are less than 1 square foot for each 300 square feet of crawl space area, or if the crawl space vents are equipped with operable louvers, a radon vent shall be installed to originate from a point between the ground cover and soil. The radon vent shall be installed in accordance with Section (c)5 below.

 (c) Crawl Space Plenum Systems.

 1. General. In crawl space plenum systems used for providing supply air for an HVAC system, aggregate, a permanently sealed soil gas retarder membrane and a radon vent pipe shall be installed in accordance with this section. Crawl spaces shall not be used for return air plenums.

 In addition, an operable radon vent fan shall be installed. The fan shall be located as specified in this section. The fan shall be capable of providing at least 100 CFM at one-inch water column static pressure. The fan shall be controlled by a readily accessible manual switch. The switch shall be labeled "RADON VENT FAN."

 2. Aggregate. A layer of aggregate of 4-inch-minimum thickness shall be placed beneath the concrete slab. The aggregate shall be continuous to the extent practical. Aggregate shall:

 A. Comply with ASTM Standard No. C-33 Standard Specification for Concrete Aggregate and shall be size No. ~~67~~8 or larger size aggregate as listed in Table No. 2, Grading Requirements for Coarse Aggregate; or

 B. Meet the 1988 Washington State Department of Transportation specification 9-03.1 (3) "Coarse Aggregate for Portland Cement Concrete", or any equivalent standards approved by the building official. Aggregate size shall be of Grade ~~5~~8 or larger as listed in section 9-03.1 (3) C, "Grading"; or

 C. Be screened, washed ~~and~~pea gravel free of deleterious substances in a manner consistent with ASTM Standard No. C-33 with 100 percent ~~of the gravel~~ passing a one-half inch sieve and less than ~~2~~5 percent passing a ~~4-inch~~No. 16 sieve. Sieve characteristics shall conform to those acceptable under ASTM Standard No. C-33.

 EXCEPTION: Aggregate shall not be required if a substitute material or system, with sufficient load bearing characteristics, and having approved capability to provide equal or superior air flow, is installed.

 3. Soil-gas Retarder Membrane. A soil-gas retarder membrane, consisting of at least one layer of virgin polyethylene with a thickness of at least 6 mil, or equivalent flexible sheet material, shall be either placed directly under the concrete slab so that the slab is in direct contact with the membrane, or on top of the aggregate with 2-inches minimum of fine sand or pea gravel installed between the concrete slab and membrane. The flexible sheet shall extend to the foundation wall or to the outside edge of the monolithic slab. Seams shall overlap at least 12 inches. The membrane shall also be fitted tightly to all pipes, wires, and other penetrations of the membrane and sealed with an approved sealant or tape. All punctures or tears shall be repaired with the same or approved material and similarly lapped and sealed.

~~EXCEPTION: If the membrane is not in direct contact with the bottom of the concrete slab, all overlapping seams shall be sealed with an approved tape or sealant, and the material shall be sealed to the foundation wall in a permanent manner. The membrane shall also be fitted tightly to all pipes, wire, and other penetrations of the membrane and sealed with an approved sealant or tape. All punctures or tears shall be repaired with the same or approved material and similarly lapped and sealed. In no case shall the membrane be installed below the aggregate.~~

 4. Sealing of Penetrations and Joints. All penetrations and joints in concrete slabs or other floor systems and walls below grade shall be sealed by an approved sealant to create an air barrier to limit the movement of soil gas into the indoor air.

 Sealants shall be approved by the manufacturer for the intended purpose. Sealant joints shall conform to manufacturer's specifications. There shall be no gaps or voids after the sealant has cured.

 Concrete block walls connected to below grade areas shall be considered unsealed surfaces. All openings in concrete block walls that will not remain accessible upon completion of the building shall be sealed at both vertical and horizontal surfaces, in order to create a continuous air barrier to limit the transport of soil gas into the indoor air.

 5. Radon Vent. One continuous sealed pipe shall run from a point within the aggregate under each concrete slab to a point outside the building. Joints and connections shall be permanently gas tight.

 The continuous sealed pipe shall interface with the aggregate in the following manner, or by other approved equal method: The pipe shall be permanently connected to a "T" lie within the aggregate area. A minimum of five feet of perforated drain pipe of three inches minimum diameter shall join to and extend from the "T". The perforated pipe shall remain in the aggregate area and shall not be capped at the ends. The "T" and its perforated pipe extensions shall be located at least five feet horizontally from the exterior perimeter of the aggregate area.

 The continuous sealed pipe shall terminate no less than 12 inches above the eave, and more than 10 horizontal feet from a woodstove or fireplace chimney, or operable window. The continuous sealed pipe shall be labeled "Radon Vent". The label shall be placed so as to remain visible to an occupant.

 The minimum pipe diameter shall be 3 inches unless otherwise approved. Acceptable sealed plastic pipe shall be smooth walled, and may include either PVC schedule 40 or ABS schedule of equivalent wall thickness.

 The entire sealed pipe system shall be sloped to drain to the sub-slab aggregate.

 The sealed pipe system may pass through an unconditioned attic before exiting the building; but to the extent practicable, the sealed pipe shall be located inside the thermal envelope of the building in order to enhance passive stack venting.

 EXCEPTION: A radon vent shall not be required if a fan- forced sub-slab depressurization system is installed. A fan- forced sub-slab depressurization system includes:

 1. Soil-gas retarder membrane as specified in Section (c)3;

 2. Sealing of penetrations and joints as specified in Section (c) 4;

 3. A 3-inch continuous sealed radon pipe which shall run from a point within the aggregate under each concrete slab to a point outside the building;

 4. Joints and connections may be gas tight, and may be of either PVC schedule 40 or ABS schedule of equivalent wall thickness;

 5. A label of "Radon Vent" shall be placed on the pipe so as to remain visible to the occupant; and

 6. Fan circuit and wiring as specified in Section (c) 6 and a fan.

 If the sub-slab depressurization system is exhausted through the concrete foundation wall or rim joist, the exhaust terminus shall be a minimum of six feet from operable widows and outdoor air intake vents and shall be directed away from operable windows and outdoor air intake vents to prevent radon re-entrainment.

 6. Fan Circuit and Wiring and Location. An area for location of an in-line fan shall be provided. The location shall be as close as practicable to the radon vent pipe's point of exit from the building, or shall be outside the building shell. It shall be located so that the fan and all downstream piping is isolated from the indoor air.

 Provisions shall be made to allow future activation of an in-line fan on the radon vent pipe without the need to place new wiring. A 110 volt power supply shall be provided at a junction box near the fan location.

 7. Separate Aggregate Areas. If the 4 inch aggregate area underneath the concrete slab is not continuous, but is separated into distinct isolated aggregate areas by a footing or other barrier, a minimum of one radon vent pipe shall be installed into each separate aggregate area.

 EXCEPTION: Separate aggregate areas may be considered a single area if a minimum 3 inch diameter connection joining the separate areas is provided for every 30 feet of barrier separating those areas.

 VIAQ: FORMALDEHYDE REDUCTION MEASURES. In all Group R Occupancies all structural panel components within the conditioned space such as plywood, particle board, wafer board, and oriented strand board shall be identified as "EXPOSURE 1", "EXTERIOR" OR "HUD APPROVED".

 Section 43. Subsection 1506.3 of the 1997 Seattle Building Code, as adopted by Ordinance 119079, is amended as follows:

 1506.3 Overflow Drains and Scuppers. Where roof drains are required, overflow drains, sized to accommodate the area to be drained with no more than 2 inches (51 mm) of ponding, shall be installed with the inlet flow line located 2 inches (51 mm) above the low point of the roof, or overflow scuppers having three times the size of the roof drains and having a minimum opening height of 4 inches (102 mm) may be installed in the adjacent parapet walls with the inlet flow line located 2 inches (51 mm) above the low point of the adjacent roof.

 All roof drains and overflow drains shall be provided with strainers.

 Overflow drains shall discharge to an approved location and shall not be connected to roof drain lines.
