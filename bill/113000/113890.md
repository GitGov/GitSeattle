 ORDINANCE _________

 AN ORDINANCE relating to decreasing the utility business tax on the business of selling or furnishing water; and amending Seattle Municipal Code Section 5.48.050.

 WHEREAS, Seattle Municipal Code Section 5.48.050 establishes a utility business tax on the selling or furnishing of water for hire; and

 WHEREAS, Seattle Public Utilities has worked for many years with the City of Tacoma and certain other utilities to develop the Second Supply Project, which would allow water from Tacoma's second water right on the Green River to be brought to Seattle's Cedar River water supply system; and

 WHEREAS, Ordinance 119860 increased the rate of the utility business tax on the selling or furnishing of water for hire from ten percent (10%) to ten and one-tenth percent (10.1%) in anticipation of increased indirect administrative overhead costs to be incurred by the City's General Fund in connection with the Second Supply Project; and

 WHEREAS, with the passage of Ordinance 120150, the Mayor and City Council authorized execution of an agreement providing for the joint development of the proposed Second Supply Project with the City of Tacoma and certain other utilities; and

 WHEREAS, the City of Seattle now finds that administrative overhead costs incurred in connection with participation in the Second Supply Project have been reduced and that the tax increase approved in Ordinance 119860 is no longer required to meet such costs; NOW THEREFORE,

 Section 3. This ordinance shall take effect and be in force thirty (30) days from and after its approval by the Mayor, but if not approved and returned by the Mayor within ten (10) days after presentation, it shall take effect as provided by Municipal Code Section 1.04.020.
