 AN ORDINANCE increasing the street use permit fee for water utility system construction work by Seattle Public Utilities on water utility mains in areas under the jurisdiction of Seattle Transportation, and authorizing the Director of Seattle Transportation to collect such fee in accordance with Seattle Municipal Code Chapter 15.04.

 WHEREAS, Ordinance 116439, as most recently amended by Ordinance 119673, adopted a Street Use Permit Fee Schedule; and

 WHEREAS the adopted Street Use Permit Fee Schedule currently includes a $68 fee for all utility system construction permits; and

 WHEREAS, the City finds that it is in the public interest to increase the level of initial review carried out in connection with water utility construction work on water system mains conducted within City street right of way in light of the potential environmental consequences of such work and the need to assure that such work will be done in a way that avoids water quality degradation from proximity to other utilities and minimizes damage to the public right of way, and that it therefore is appropriate to increase the permit fee applicable to such work commensurate with the increased cost of administration of this permit review; and

 WHEREAS, pending the completion of environmental review, the City is considering becoming a participant in and making a major financial commitment to the joint development with the City of Tacoma and certain other utilities of the proposed Second Supply Project, which would allow water from Tacoma's second water right on the Green River to be brought to Seattle's Cedar River water supply system, and that the potential water conservation and environmental benefits associated with the Second Supply project could be partially offset by any failure to adequately review in-street water utility construction work on water system mains; and

 WHEREAS, the City believes that the purported blanket voter approval requirement of Section 2 Initiative 695 is neither constitutionally valid as applied to City regulatory permit fees, nor in the public interest;

 NOW THEREFORE, BE IT ORDAINED BY THE CITY OF SEATTLE AS FOLLOWS:

 Section 1. Notwithstanding the procedural provisions set forth in Seattle Municipal Code Chapter 15.04, the City's Street Use Permit Fee Schedule is hereby amended to increase the permit fee applicable to water utility system construction work on water mains by amending category 51 (Utility System Construction) and adding a new subcategory 51(a) (Water Utility System Construction on Water Mains) as follows:

 Type of Use Permit Fee Requirements

 51. Utility System Construc- 68.00 Plus cost of inspection, tion Other than Water mapping and related Utility System engineering services Construction on Water billed at 96.00 / hour Mains

 51.(a) Water Utility System 150.00 Plus cost of inspection, Construction on Water mapping and related Mains engineering services billed at 96.00 / hour

 Section 2. This ordinance shall take effect and be in force thirty (30) days from and after its approval by the Mayor, but if not approved and returned by the Mayor within ten (10) days after presentation, it shall take effect as provided by Municipal Code Section 1.04.020.

 Passed by the City Council the _____ day of ____________, 2000, and signed by me in open session in authentication of its passage this _____ day of _________________, 2000. _____________________________________ President _______ of the City Council
