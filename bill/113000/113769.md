 ORDINANCE __________________

 AN ORDINANCE relating to Seattle Public Utilities; revising the 2001-2002 budget of the Solid Waste Fund to provide for certain expenditures related to implementation and performance of contracts for collection of commercial waste in the city of Seattle.

 WHEREAS, pursuant to Ordinance 120241, the City of Seattle, Seattle Public Utilities ("SPU"), has assumed responsibility for the collection of municipal solid waste and construction, demolition and landclearing waste from commercial establishments in the city of Seattle ("Commercial Waste") and has entered into contracts with Rabanco, Ltd. and Waste Management of Washington, Inc. to collect such waste beginning April 1, 2001; and

 WHEREAS, Commercial Waste collection under the contracts will result in increases in revenues and expenditures in SPU's Solid Waste Fund (Fund 45010) beginning in April, 2001; and

 WHEREAS, revenues will increase because the City has set rates for Commercial Waste collection pursuant to Ordinance 120250, and the contractors bill customers, receive payments and deposit them with the City; and

 WHEREAS, expenses will increase because the City will reimburse the contractors on a monthly basis for their services and pay taxes and fees related to those services; and

 WHEREAS, Seattle Public Utilities will require funding for additional staff and professional services in order to implement the contracts and provide for Commercial Waste collection; and

 WHEREAS, in 2001 SPU will make a one-time payment of $450,000 to each of the contractors for costs associated with the transition from Washington Utilities and Transportation Commission regulation to City contract; and

 WHEREAS, for accounting purposes, SPU intends to amortize these transition payments over the seven-year term of the contracts; and
