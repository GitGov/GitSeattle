 AN ORDINANCE providing for the submission to the qualified electors of the City at the special election requested to be held on November 6, 2001, a proposed measure relating to water supply, as a substitute for proposed Initiative Measure No. 63; increasing water conservation and re-use in Seattle, establishing a 6 mgd special "water trust" to enhance stream flows for fish, broadening a conservation program for low-income housing, expanding the water conservation audit program for commercial customers, and declaring Seattle's commitment to responsible regional water stewardship.

 WHEREAS, Seattle's water system provides essential municipal water supply to 1.3 million people through 27 suburban utilities and water districts as well as within the City of Seattle; and

 WHEREAS, the region is working to recover threatened species of fish by improving fish habitat, which in some cases may require making less water available for municipal purposes as more water is left in rivers. At the same time, strong growth in the Central Puget Sound area's population and corresponding municipal water supply needs are forecast to continue in both the near- and long- term; and

 WHEREAS, Seattle citizens recognize that voluntary water conservation is necessary to balance the needs of our growing community and a healthy environment, and to avoid the future environmental and economic impacts of developing new water sources or increasing withdrawal from existing resources. Citizens of Seattle and the region reduced water use by 15% during the 2001 drought without mandatory watering bans; and

 WHEREAS, the City of Seattle is committed to developing a framework for integrated water resource management in the Central Puget Sound region that ensures water for fish and for people, and that helps meet federal, state and tribal natural resource management objectives; and

 WHEREAS, Seattle has demonstrated its leadership in water conservation, including its Cedar River Habitat Conservation Plan, its work to extol environmental stewardship and conservation regionally through the Central Puget Sound Water Suppliers' Forum, and its commitment to working in partnership with the environmental community; and

 WHEREAS, Seattle has agreed to mandatory, scientifically-based, stream flow requirements in both the federal license for the Tolt River and in the Habitat Conservation Plan for the Cedar River; and

 WHEREAS, Seattle citizens want a cost-effective conservation program that allows all individuals, regardless of their income, to contribute, by assisting in the retrofitting of low-income housing for water conservation. The public benefit of such a program would outweigh any incidental benefit to the participants in the program, as demonstrated by the City's successful programs providing weatherization and other energy conservation measures in low-income housing. Now therefore,

 BE IT ORDAINED BY THE CITY OF SEATTLE AS FOLLOWS:

 Section 1. Water for Salmon.

 A. For the purpose of protecting and enhancing stream flows in fish-bearing streams and tributaries in the region, Seattle Public Utilities shall, in cooperation with its wholesale customers, establish a "water trust" to be know as the Seattle-Central Puget Sound Regional Water Reserve (Regional Water Reserve). The wholesale customers are the 27 suburbs and water utilities that rely on the Seattle water system for all or part of their municipal water supply.

 B. Seattle Public Utilities shall make available 6 million gallons per day (mgd) to the Regional Water Reserve by 2010, to be used for fish as provided in this section.

 C. Sources of water for the Regional Water Reserve may include water from conservation acquired elsewhere in the region, reused and reclaimed stormwater and wastewater, and other sources. Seattle Public Utilities shall work with other agencies to make available reclaimed stormwater and wastewater that may be used to fulfill part of this commitment.

 D. Seattle Public Utilities, acting through the Regional Water Reserve, may contract to provide replacement water to any person or entity who presents evidence of a valid surface or ground water right, and who transfers, either on a temporary or a permanent basis, such water right via contractual mechanism or via the Washington State Trust Water Program established under chapter 90.42 RCW, provided that:

 (1) The water right to be transferred to the State Trust Water Program is from a surface water body, or from a hydraulically- connected groundwater body, that provides critical habitat for an aquatic species that is listed as threatened or endangered under federal law, or is listed as depressed or threatened by reason of inadequate stream flow under state law, and the trust water transfer otherwise qualifies under RCW 90.42.080;

 (2) The place of use of water rights contracted for use from the Regional Water Reserve is located within the service area of one of Seattle's wholesale water customers or is otherwise approved by the Washington Department of Ecology;

 (3) Any conditions imposed by the transferor of water rights to the State Trust Water Program are consistent with the limitations otherwise imposed under state law; and

 (4) The term of the contract does not exceed the term of the proposed Trust water transfer.

 Section 2. Water Conservation Programs. Seattle Public Utilities will establish and continue aggressive voluntary water conservation within Seattle Public Utilities' retail service area and, subject to participation by each wholesale customer, within the service area of each of its wholesale customers, with the following priorities:

 A. Retrofit program for low-income housing. Within six months after passage of this Measure, Seattle Public Utilities shall develop and implement a low-income water conservation program, to be known as the "Everyone Can Conserve" Program, to retrofit Qualifying Low-income Units and Qualifying Low-income Buildings for water conservation within the service areas of Seattle and participating wholesale customers. The Program shall assist with the supply and installation of cost-effective water conservation measures within Qualifying Low-income Units at a minimum, and shall be administered jointly by Seattle Public Utilities, the Office of Housing and participating wholesale customers.

 B. Commercial and large-volume residential customers. The City shall seek to increase water use efficiency by commercial and large-volume residential customers. These efficiencies would reduce facility operating costs and could save significant quantities of water. To that end, Seattle Public Utilities shall develop and implement an expanded program to audit commercial and large-volume residential customers for conservation and water use efficiency opportunities, implement conservation and water use efficiency measures, and recommend rate and other conservation incentives where appropriate.

 C. Conservation research and demonstration project. Seattle Public Utilities shall undertake one or more projects to demonstrate the reliability, cost-effectiveness, and rate impacts of installing technically-achievable water conservation and efficiency measures in new or existing commercial, industrial, residential and mixed-use buildings. Measures to be included in the project may include water-efficient plumbing fixtures and appliances, efficient irrigation systems, systems that utilize stormwater and rainwater, and other innovative water use efficiency and conservation measures. In designing and implementing the demonstration project, Seattle Public Utilities shall consult with the community and with the Regional Conservation Entity envisioned in Seattle City Council Resolution 30259, if established. Seattle Public Utilities shall provide funding to implement technically achievable conservation and efficiency measures under the program and shall provide an evaluation of the demonstration project's reliability, community acceptance, cost-effectiveness and the impact of the project on rates and revenues in its annual reporting process to the Seattle City Council.

 Section 3. Shared Water Stewardship.

 A. Seattle will work with other water utilities in the greater metropolitan area to find regional solutions to issues of municipal water supply for urban areas, conservation and flows for fish. Seattle Public Utilities shall identify water conservation measures within its service area that are eligible for implementation under an Accelerated Regional Water Conservation Program (Accelerated Program). Seattle Public Utilities, in consultation with its wholesale customer Operating Board, shall also request that wholesale customers identify projects within their respective service areas to include in the Accelerated Program.

 B. Seattle Public Utilities, in consultation with King County Metro and other agencies, shall identify opportunities within the service areas of Seattle and its wholesale customers to reuse wastewater and to reclaim stormwater for irrigation and other non- potable uses. Seattle Public Utilities shall include potential reuse and reclaimed water projects identified under this Section as elements of the Accelerated Program.

 C. Seattle Public Utilities, in consultation with its wholesale customer Operating Board, may condition contracts to provide water supply to new wholesale customers on their agreement to fund implementation of measures identified under the Accelerated Program.

 Section 4. Reporting Requirements. Within eighteen months after passage of this Measure, the City shall adopt a revised Water Conservation Plan outlining the steps and timeline for implementation of this Measure. Seattle Public Utilities shall thereafter demonstrate compliance with this Measure in its annual reporting process, a summary of which shall be communicated to ratepayers.

 Section 5. Definitions. As used in this ordinance, the following words shall have the following meanings:

 A. "Cost-effective water conservation" or "cost-effective water conservation measures" are those measures that can be implemented at a marginal cost that is less than that of the next available source of water supply. This calculation must also take into consideration the following factors (1) a 10% multiplier to increase the calculated benefit of conservation measures to account for economic and ecological benefits of conservation; and (2) best estimates of other benefits obtained by conservation measures, including savings relating to reduced demand for electricity, sewer, wastewater, etc. Measures to be included in the demonstration project authorized in Section 2.C. shall include both cost-effective water conservation and other conservation measures that are technically achievable.

 B. "Low-income individuals or families" are those individuals or families earning less than 50% of median income as defined in the Metropolitan and Nonmetropolitan Statistical Area median income adjusted for household size as defined by the United States Department of Housing and Urban Development.

 C. "Qualifying low-income building." A building in which at least 50% of units are Qualified Low-income Units.

 D. "Qualifying low-income unit." A residential unit that is in the retail service area of the City of Seattle or of one of its wholesale customers and has a certificate of occupancy or is otherwise legally occupied at the time of passage of this Initiative; and: is owned or managed by a housing authority; or is subject to rent and income restrictions recorded against the property limiting its occupants to very low-income households or families; or is owned by a low-income owner-occupant; or where the owner provides proof the unit is occupied by low-income tenants and that the rents are no more than 35% of the occupant's income, and such owner agrees not to raise rents as a result of the improvements provided by this Program.

 E. "Regional Conservation Entity" means the organization envisioned in City Council Resolution 30259, adopted on November 6, 2000.

 F. "Regional Water Reserve" means the "Seattle-Central Puget Sound Regional Water Reserve" established under Section 1.A.

 G. State Trust Water Program" means the trust water program established by the Washington Department of Ecology under RCW 90.42.040.
