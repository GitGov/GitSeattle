 This Amendment, made on or as of the day of , ____, to that Contract of Sale dated July __, 1999, by and between The City of Seattle, a municipal corporation of the State of Washington, (hereinafter called "City") and HomeSight, a Washington nonprofit corporation (hereinafter called "Purchaser"), whose address is 3405 South Alaska Street, Seattle, Washington 98118,

 WITNESSETH:

 WHEREAS, pursuant to Ordinance 119296, City and Purchaser entered into a Contract for Sale of Land dated July __, 1999 ("Contract"), for redevelopment of that certain parcel of City-owned land legally described therein and identified in the I-90 Area Development Policies as Parcel 38 ("the Parcel"); and

 WHEREAS, pursuant to such Agreement, Purchaser fulfilled all conditions precedent for closing and the City delivered the deed to the Parcel to Purchaser on August 19, 1999; and

 WHEREAS, part of the consideration for conveyance of the Parcel from the City to Purchaser was Purchaser's agreement to make every effort to offer a majority of homes developed on the Parcel at prices affordable to low-income, first-time home buyers and Purchaser's commitment to sell at least six homes to low-income buyers if they were able to obtain gap financing; and

 WHEREAS, the Purchaser has indicated that in light of unforeseen site conditions, higher interest rates and other factors it may be impracticable to offer a majority of the homes at prices affordable to such persons, and the City is willing to agree to a reduction in the minimum number if the Purchaser agrees to specific affordable prices and terms for a smaller number of homes; and

 WHEREAS, the City Council, by Ordinance ________, adopted ______________, 1999, has authorized this amendment to the provisions of the Contract with respect to affordable housing,

 Now, Therefore, the parties hereto, for and in consideration of the promises and mutual obligations herein undertaken, do hereby agree to amend the Agreement as follows:

 1. Section 101 of the Contract is hereby amended as follows (underlined language, except caption, is added; language struck out is deleted):

 Section 101. Intent to Develop; Purpose of Development.

 Purchaser represents and agrees that the purchase of the Property is for the purpose of immediate development of dwellings, at leastthe majority three of which are intended for sale to first-time home buyers, as defined in the City of Seattle 1995 Housing Levy Administrative and Financial Plan adopted by Ordinance 119168, with incomes at or below the Section 8 low-income limits for the Seattle- Everett-Bellevue PMSA, adjusted for family size, as published by the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development ("HUD") and not for speculation in land holding. The parties acknowledge that Purchaser's covenants to construct Improvements in accordance with the terms and conditions contained herein are material to the City's agreement to convey the Parcel.

 2. Section 402, paragraph B, of the Contract is hereby amended as follows (underlined language, except caption, is added; language struck out is deleted):

 B. Homes for Low-Income Buyers. Purchaser shall make every effort to assure that agrees to offer at least six three homes on the Property are affordable for purchase by low-income buyers, defined as households with incomes at or below Section 8 low-income limits for the Seattle-Bellevue-Everett PMSA, adjusted for family size, as published by HUD; such efforts to include, without limitation, using any available proceeds from any homes on the Property that are sold for more than the Purchasers' development costs to offset below-cost sales to low-income buyers. , at prices not to exceed the 1999 appraised value of $168,430, exclusive of the cost of custom features, if any, specifically contracted for by qualified low-income buyers. Purchaser further agrees to finance a portion of the purchase price of each such unit offered to low-income buyers through residual value notes, in amounts up to $18,000 per unit as needed to make such units affordable to low-income buyers. The terms of such residual value notes shall be substantially as set forth in Attachment 1 to this Amendment unless otherwise approved by the City, and in any case shall not require any payment for at least ten years except in the event of default or other circumstances in which the entire balance becomes due.

 In determining the affordability of homes for purchase by low-income buyers, Purchaser may take into consideration the availability of programs offering special loan terms, down payment assistance, etc. to such buyers. Methods and assumptions for determining affordability shall be as follows unless specifically modified with the consent of the Director in consideration of the features and terms of such programs:

 (1) Income adjustments for family size shall be based upon a presumed family size of 1.5 persons for each bedroom in a home, rounded down to the next lowest integer in case such presumed family size is not an integer.

 (2) Monthly payments for mortgage principal, interest, taxes, and insurance (including mortgage insurance, if applicable) may not exceed 30% of the gross monthly income of a presumed family at the Section 8 low-income limit, assuming a 30-year, fixed-rate mortgage and a cash downpayment from the buyer's resources no greater than ten percent (10%) of the sale price.

 (3) Purchaser shall clearly specify all assumptions used in determining an affordable price, including interest rates, allowance for taxes, insurance, and mortgage insurance, and the amount of any other applicable fees and charges.

 Provided that qualified low-income buyers are able to obtain gap financing, in addition to the above-referenced residual value notes, in the form of grants or deferred-payment loans in amounts up to $30,000 per buyer, or such greater amount as may be approved by the Director, Purchaser represents and agrees that a minimum of six (6) three (3) homes on the Property will be sold to low-income, first-time buyers.

 3. Except as expressly modified hereby the Contract remains in full force and effect. Purchaser represents and warrants that the execution and delivery of this amendment by the individual executing it below has been duly authorized by all necessary corporate action; that Purchaser has not transferred or encumbered the Parcel except as expressly permitted in writing by the City; and that the Agreement, as amended hereby, is the legal, valid, binding obligation of Purchaser, enforceable in accordance with its terms.

 EXECUTED as of the day and year first above written.
