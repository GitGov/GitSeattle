 AN ORDINANCE relating to buildings damaged by the Nisqually Earthquake; authorizing submission of an application for and acceptance of a Financial Assistance Award from the United States Department of Commerce - Economic Development Administration; authorizing the implementation of certain post-earthquake economic development activities; making a reimbursable appropriation from the Emergency Subfund of the General Fund; authorizing the Director of the Office of Economic Development to enter into such agreements as shall be necessary and appropriate; ratifying and confirming prior acts; and declaring an emergency; all by a three-fourths vote of the City Council.

 WHEREAS, the United States Department of Commerce - Economic Development Administration (EDA) has invited The City of Seattle Office of Economic Development (OED) to apply for funds under the Economic Adjustment provisions of the Economic Development Act for certain post-earthquake recovery and economic development activities; and

 WHEREAS, OED expects to receive from the EDA on behalf of the City a Financial Assistance Award for post-earthquake economic development activities such as assisting the owners of damaged buildings, particularly historic buildings, to make comprehensive evaluations of the damage to their buildings and assist the owners in identifying all viable stabilization and rehabilitation options; and

 WHEREAS, previously appropriated funds are available to satisfy the matching requirement required by the EDA; and

 WHEREAS, acceptance of the EDA grant will not require additional staff for grant administration and program monitoring;

 NOW, THEREFORE,

 BE IT ORDAINED BY THE CITY OF SEATTLE AS FOLLOWS:

 Section 1. The Mayor or the Director of the Office of Economic Development (OED) is hereby authorized, for and on behalf of The City of Seattle, to submit an application for and to enter into an agreement with the United States Department of Commerce - Economic Development Administration (EDA) to accept a grant in the amount of Ninety-eight Thousand Dollars ($98,000.00), or such lesser amount as shall be available, for the purposes described in Attachment A to this ordinance. The funds to be received from the EDA shall be deposited into the Emergency Account of the Emergency Subfund of the General Fund. The OED Director is designated as the authorized representative of the City to supply the EDA with such documents and information as may be required to submit the completed application and accept the award of grant funds. The OED Director is further authorized to make, for and on behalf of The City of Seattle, all assurances, promises, representations and consent to  suit specified in the grant application or otherwise required by EDA and to comply with all applicable regulations of the United States relating to implementation of the activities described in Attachment A.

 Section 2. Subject to and consistent with applicable provisions of the Constitution and laws of the State of Washington and the Charter and laws of the City of Seattle, the OED Director is authorized, for and on behalf of the City, to implement the activities identified in Attachment A, and to enter into, perform, administer, and modify such agreements as shall be necessary or appropriate to implement such activities.

 Section 3. For the purposes described in Attachment A, the sum of Ninety-eight Thousand Dollars ($98,000.00), or so much thereof as is equal to the funding available under the grant agreement authorized by Section 1 of this ordinance, is hereby appropriated from the Emergency Account of the Emergency Subfund of the General Fund, contingent upon the execution by the City and the EDA of the grant agreement authorized in this ordinance and upon notification from the EDA of the availability of funds thereunder. The Emergency Account of the Emergency Subfund of the General Fund is to be reimbursed by the funds to be accepted pursuant to the authority granted in Section 1 of this ordinance. This appropriation shall carry forward from year to year unless expressly abandoned by ordinance.

 Section 4. The Nisqually Earthquake of February 28, 2001, created a need for immediate resources to assist the owners of damaged buildings with technical assistance to enable them to make a thorough evaluation of the damage to their buildings, quickly identify viable stabilization and rehabilitation options, and then obtain financing to undertake the stabilization and/or rehabilitation needed. Such technical assistance is essential to make damaged buildings safe for occupation, avoid unnecessary demolition, particularly of historic buildings, and retain the impacted businesses, some of which businesses may be forced to relocate or even close if the damaged buildings are demolished or left exposed to further damage. Therefore the City Council finds that an emergency exists in which it is necessary for the preservation of the public health and safety that this ordinance become effective without delay.

 Section 5. The foregoing appropriation is made to meet actual necessary expenditures of the City caused by an earthquake, which event could not be reasonably have been anticipated. Now, therefore, in accordance with RCW 35.32A.060(1) and the City Charter, by reason of the facts stated above, this ordinance shall take effect immediately upon approval or signing of the same by the Mayor or passage over his veto.

 Section 6. Any act pursuant to the authority and prior to the effective date of this ordinance is hereby ratified and confirmed.

 Passed by a three-fourths (3/4) vote of all the members of the City Council the _____ day of ____________, 2001, and signed by me in open session in authentication of its passage this _____ day of
