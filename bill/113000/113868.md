 WHEREAS, the South Lake Union Park - Wharf Development Project (K73981) in Capital Improvement Program K72981 is in accordance with the revised park master plan adopted by Resolution 30206, which states that "the City will, with financial assistance of and input from the [Maritime Heritage] Foundation, construct a wharf ("Lake Union Wharf") at the north end of the Armory building to provide moorage for historic ships"; and

 WHEREAS, on July 1, 2000, the Kreielsheimer Foundation presented a check for $1 million to the City to support the implementation of the basic wharf improvements necessary to make the facility operational by approximately June 2002; and

 WHEREAS, the Kreielsheimer Foundation gift was deposited into the General Donations and Gifts Trust Subfund (63720) on August 30, 2000, and as of July 31, 2001, had earned interest in the amount of $59,888; and

 WHEREAS, the Maritime Heritage Foundation ("MHF") has received a grant from the Washington State Historical Society Heritage Resource Center for construction of the wharf and a grant from the 2001 King County Heritage Cultural Facilities Program for "wharf amenities;" and

 WHEREAS, the MHF has expressed its intent to convey to the City all funding received by the MHF as a consequence of the State and County grants; and

 WHEREAS, the Department of Parks and Recreation will assist the MHF in documenting grant expenditures to comply with the MHF's contracts with King County and State of Washington; and

 WHEREAS, in November 2000, Seattle voters approved the Neighborhood Parks, Green Spaces, Trails and Zoo Levy, which included an additional $5 million for the South Lake Union Park - Development Project (K733134), of which the wharf development is an integral part; and

 WHEREAS, the existing wharf was damaged by the February 28, 2001 Nisqually Earthquake; and

 WHEREAS, discussions are underway with the Federal Emergency Management Agency ("FEMA") and the City's insurance carrier regarding repairs to the wharf; and

 WHEREAS, Parks Department staff estimate that $50,000 to $1 million may be recovered in the form of FEMA assistance and/or insurance proceeds, but believe no accurate information about the exact amount of such funding will be available until after the effective date of this ordinance; and

 WHEREAS, the MHF has committed to raising the balance of the project costs through a fundraising campaign and additional grants; and

 WHEREAS, appropriations are necessary to allow the first phase of the project to be implemented, with the intent that a wharf will be in place when the Tall Ships Challenge 2002 Conference occurs; and

 WHEREAS, it is necessary to draw upon the 2000 Parks Levy Fund to ensure that the wharf project is completed in a timely manner, which action is taken in anticipation of the receipt of reimbursements from insurance and/or FEMA proceeds for earthquake damages to the north apron and additional funding from the MHF;
