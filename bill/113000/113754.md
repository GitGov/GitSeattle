 BETWEEN KING COUNTY AND THE CITY OF SEATTLE

 FOR OPEN SPACE ACQUISITION PROJECTS

 Preamble

 The King County Council, through Ordinance 9128, has established a Conservation Futures Levy Fund and appropriated proceeds to King County, the City of Seattle, and certain suburban cities. Ordinance 9430 provided for the use of Conservation Futures Levy proceeds collected in the years 1990 through 1993 for the completion of projects as set forth in Ordinance 9071. Ordinance 10750 established a biennial allocation process that began in 1994. This amendment is entered into to provide for the allocation of a portion of the proceeds made available from the 1998 and 1999 Conservation Futures Levy proceeds.

 THIS AMENDMENT is entered into between the CITY OF SEATTLE ("City") and KING COUNTY, and amends and attaches to and is part thereof of the existing Interlocal Cooperation Agreement entered into between the parties on the 5th day of June, 1990.

 The parties agree to the following amendments:

 Amendment 1: Article 1. Recitals

 A paragraph is hereby added to the Recitals Section to provide for an allocation of 1998 and 1999 Conservation Futures Levy proceeds, and hereafter reads:

 "On February December 3, 1999 the King County Council passed Ordinance 13678, which appropriated a total of Seventy Thousand Dollars ($70,000) in Conservation Futures Levy proceeds to the City of Seattle. The Council has approved the allocation of 1998 and 1999 Conservation Futures Levy proceeds to the City of Seattle and through Ordinance 13794 authorized the King County Executive to amend the existing interlocal cooperation agreement with the City of Seattle in order to initiate the approved payments."

 Amendment 2: Article V. Conditions of Agreement

 Section 5.1 is amended to include Attachment M, which lists the 1998 and 1999 Conservation Futures Levy proceeds allocation for the City of Seattle's Leschi Natural Area and Georgetown Neighborhood Open Space Projects, and hereafter reads:

 Section 5.1, Project Description. Funds available pursuant to this agreement may be used only for Projects. Current Projects are listed in Attachments A through M. The County may approve other Projects in the future.

 Amendment 2: Article VII. Responsibilities of County

 The first two sentences of this article are amended to include Attachment M, which lists the 1998 and 1999 Conservation Futures Levy proceeds allocation for the City of Seattle's Leschi Natural Area and Georgetown Neighborhood Open Space Projects Projects, and hereafter read:

 "Subject to the terms of this agreement, the County will provide Conservation Futures Levy Funds in the amounts shown in Attachments A through M to be used for the Projects listed in Attachments A through M. The City may request additional funds; however, the County has no obligation to provide funds to the City for the Projects in excess of the total amounts shown in Attachments A through M. The County assumes no obligation for future support of the Projects described herein except as expressly set forth in this agreement."

 In all other respects, the terms, conditions, duties and obligations of both parties shall remain the same as agreed to in the Interlocal Cooperation Agreement.
