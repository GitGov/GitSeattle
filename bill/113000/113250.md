 ORDINANCE _________

 AN ORDINANCE authorizing execution of a release and termination of an equitable servitude burdening property owned by the University of Washington and proposed for the University of Washington's Indoor Practice Facility.

 WHEREAS, the City of Seattle (City), with the concurrence of the Washington State Department of Ecology (Ecology), granted a shoreline variance to the University of Washington (University) for construction on its campus of the Nordstrom Tennis Center (MUP No. 8703723), and as a condition of that approval required an equitable servitude restricting construction of a building on an adjacent site located at Walla Walla Road (hereafter, "the Walla Walla Road site"); and

 WHEREAS, a Declaration Creating an Equitable Servitude was recorded with the King County Department of Records and Elections under Recording No. 8803250843; and

 WHEREAS, the University of Washington has now applied for a shoreline substantial development permit/shoreline public facility approval and a major institution master plan amendment to allow the construction of an Indoor Practice Facility building at the Walla Walla Road site, which the University deems necessary to accommodate the needs of the University's growing athletic programs; and

 WHEREAS, the City recognizes the University of Washington's mission to provide intercollegiate and intramural athletic programs to meet the changing demands posed by the expanding women's and men's athletic programs, and to provide for indoor practice space to keep these programs competitive; and

 WHEREAS, the City, in consultation with Ecology and the City University Community Advisory Committee (CUCAC), has reviewed the application for the Indoor Practice Facility and its associated mitigation, including a proposal to enhance shoreline wetlands and improve public access thereto; and

 WHEREAS, the City, and CUCAC agree that the Walla Walla Road site is an appropriate location for the Indoor Practice Facility given its lack of impact on the shoreline and to views of the shoreline from Montlake Blvd. NE, and that the mitigation associated with the facility can effectively accomplish the original purpose of the equitable servitude of "keeping the area attractive and promoting a passive recreational area along the waterfront;"

 NOW THEREFORE, BE IT ORDAINED BY THE CITY OF SEATTLE AS FOLLOWS:

 Section 1. After approval by the City Council of the Major Institution master plan amendment and of the shoreline substantial development permit/public facility approval, and approval of any other state or City permits required to implement the mitigation required by the City and/or agreed to by the University, and after the expiration of all appeal periods and the resolution of all appeals or other legal actions relating to the permits and approvals, the Director, Department of Design, Construction and Land Use, is authorized to execute and record a Release and Termination of Equitable Servitude in substantially the form of Exhibit 1, attached hereto.

 Section 2. This ordinance shall take effect and be in force thirty (30) days from and after its approval by the Mayor, but if not approved and returned by the Mayor within ten (10) days after presentation, it shall take effect as provided by Seattle Municipal Code Section 1.04.020.

 Passed by the City Council the _____ day of ____________, 2000, and signed by me in open session in authentication of its passage this _____ day of _________________, 2000.
