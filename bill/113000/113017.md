 AN ORDINANCE relating to low-income housing; creating a Housing Preservation Fund as a subfund of the Low Income Housing Fund; authorizing loans and loan commitments from money deposited in that subfund; authorizing related agreements and actions; increasing the expenditure allowance in the 1999 budget of the Office of Housing in order to fund such loans and commitments, by the reduction, reappropriation and transfer from the appropriation previously made for the Reserve for Housing Preservation in the Department of Finance General; authorizing the acceptance of future grants for the Housing Preservation Fund, and appropriating future grant funds for further loans and commitments.

 WHEREAS, The City of Seattle (the "City") has had a long term commitment to the development and preservation of affordable housing for low income persons; and

 WHEREAS, economic development in the region has resulted in rapidly increasing housing costs, including significant increases in rent; and

 WHEREAS, the United States Department of Housing and Urban Development's "Section 8" program and other programs have historically provided affordable rental housing to a significant number of low income Seattle residents; and

 WHEREAS, pursuant to Resolution 29800, the Executive, through the Office of Housing, on July 28, 1999, presented to the City Council a report entitled Section 8 Preservation Strategies; and

 WHEREAS, that report recommended, among other things, the establishment of a "Preservation Fund" to encourage the development and preservation of low- income housing consistent with the approaches described in the report; and

 WHEREAS, RCW 35.21.685 authorizes cities to "assist in the development and preservation of publicly or privately owned housing for persons of low income by providing loans or grants of general municipal funds to the owners or developers of the housing," and defines "low income" as income that does not exceed eighty percent of the median income for the standard metropolitan statistical area in which the city is located; and

 WHEREAS, Chapter 35.83 RCW authorizes cities to enter into agreements with housing authorities to assist those entities through loans, grants, transfers and other means of assistance in the development, retention and operation of low income housing; NOW, THEREFORE,

 BE IT ORDAINED BY THE CITY OF SEATTLE AS FOLLOWS:

 Section 1. Findings. Federal subsidies in excess of $16 million per year are provided through various HUD programs to subsidize approximately 78 buildings in Seattle, containing approximately 4,703 units of low income housing. Approximately 12 buildings containing 520 units may be removed from these programs by the building owners during the next three years, thus losing the availability of the units for low-income tenants. The creation of a new fund and the authorization of loan commitments will assist in the preservation of housing units for low income persons and will create incentives for the private sector to invest in preservation and development of low income housing.

 Section 2. Housing Preservation Fund Created. There is established in the City Treasury a Housing Preservation Fund (the "Preservation Fund"), as a subfund of the Low Income Housing Fund. Money shall be deposited in the Preservation Fund in such amounts as may be provided from time to time by ordinance. There shall also be deposited in the Preservation Fund such amounts as the City may receive for that purpose from public or private grants or from other sources. The Director of Housing is authorized to apply for and accept, for and on behalf of the City, public or private grants on terms consistent with this ordinance for deposit in the Preservation Fund, in a total amount not to exceed FIVE MILLION DOLLARS $5,000,000. All earnings on the Preservation Fund and all amounts paid to or recovered by the City on loans from the Preservation Fund shall be deposited in that fund, except that the disposition of any amounts derived from any grant shall be subject to any provisions in the terms of that grant.

 Section 3. Use of Preservation Fund; Loan Commitments.

 A. Money in the Preservation Fund may be used to provide loans to the owners or developers of publicly or privately owned housing for persons of low income, or to entities providing financing to projects that include low income housing. The Director of Housing, for the purpose of assisting owners or developers of low income housing to obtain financing, may make commitments, for and on behalf of the City, to make loans from the Preservation Fund at such future times, in such amounts, and under such terms and conditions as the Director of Housing may deem appropriate and consistent with the purposes of this ordinance. The Director of Housing shall not make a commitment under this section if it would cause the total amount of commitments then outstanding to exceed the amount on deposit in the Preservation Fund or the total unexpended appropriations from that fund, whichever is less. The City's obligation to fulfill any commitment made under this ordinance shall be absolute and irrevocable except as expressly set forth in the commitment. The duration of any commitment under this section shall not exceed 32 years; however, the term of any loan made hereunder may be longer. The intent of this ordinance is that loans may be committed and made by the City on terms that will facilitate private financing for low income housing on favorable terms; however, projects receiving loans or subsidies under other City programs may be eligible for assistance from the Preservation Fund.

 B. Loans may be made on a non-recourse basis, with such security as the Director of Housing may accept. The Director of Housing may agree, for and on behalf of the City, to the subordination, release, substitution, or assignment of security and such other arrangements with regard to the City's security position as the Director of Housing may deem appropriate. The Director of Housing, for and on behalf of the City, may make such covenants with respect to loan commitments, including without limitation covenants in favor of other parties providing financing to the same projects, as he or she may deem appropriate and consistent with the purposes of this ordinance.

 C. Loans and loan commitments made from the Preservation Fund shall be made solely to (1) public entities, (2) private non-profit entities, or (3) private for-profit entities that, at the time the loan commitment is made, are owned in whole or in part, or managed, by public or private non-profit entities or by subsidiaries of such entities.

 D. The Director of Housing may make loans and loan commitments from the Preservation Fund with respect to mixed-income housing projects and mixed-use housing projects, but the loan or loan commitment for any project may not exceed the amount determined by the Director of Housing to be necessary to support the low income housing portion of the project.

 E. As used in this ordinance, "low income" is defined as set forth in RCW Section 35.21.685. The Director of Housing is authorized, subject to applicable law, to make interpretations and administrative determinations regarding the application of such definition and to prescribe methods for measuring incomes and for adjusting income limits for household size.

 F. The authority granted in this ordinance is in addition to, and not in limitation of, authority granted to the Director of Housing under other ordinances.

 Section 4. Initial Appropriation for Preservation Fund. To provide for loans and loan commitments as authorized in this ordinance, a new line item, "Housing Preservation Fund," is added in the 1999 budget of the Office of Housing, under "Appropriation for Low-income Housing Funds," with an expenditure allowance in amount of ONE MILLION DOLLARS ($1,000,000), by the reduction, reappropriation and transfer, hereby made and authorized, of the sum of ONE MILLION DOLLARS ($1,000,000) from the Reserve for Housing Preservation (SFMS Code Q 5593000) in the 1999 budget of the Department of Finance General. In addition, there is hereby appropriated from the Preservation Fund, for the purposes authorized in this ordinance, the amount of FIVE MILLION DOLLARS ($5,000,000), or such lesser amount as shall be available from grants that are accepted and deposited therein under this ordinance at any time prior to December 31, 2002, and from earnings on such grant funds. The unexpended balances of the foregoing appropriations shall carry forward from year to year unless expressly abandoned by ordinance.

 Section 5. Severability. The provisions of this ordinance are declared to be separate and severable. If a court of competent jurisdiction shall determine any provision of this ordinance to be invalid or unenforceable as to any person or circumstance, then, subject to the right of any person to appeal such determination, such provision shall be deemed to be modified to the minimum extent necessary to be within the limits of enforceability or validity, unless the court determines that it cannot be so modified. The determination of invalidity or unenforceability of a provision as to any particular person or circumstance shall not affect the application of such provision with respect to other persons or other circumstances. In any event, notwithstanding any determination of invalidity as to a provision of this ordinance, all other provisions of this ordinance shall remain valid and enforceable.

 Section 6. Ratification of Prior Acts. Any action taken consistent with the authority but prior to the effective date of this ordinance is ratified, approved and confirmed.

 Section 7. Effective Date. This ordinance shall take effect and be in force thirty (30) days from and after its approval by the Mayor, but if not approved by the Mayor and returned by the Mayor within ten (10) days after presentation, it shall take effect as provided by Municipal Code Section 1.04.020.
