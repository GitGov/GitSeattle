 ORDINANCE __________

 AN ORDINANCE authorizing the City to develop a plan, including a finance plan, for a city-wide monorail system approximately 40 miles in length serving the four quadrants of Seattle; authorizing an appropriation of $6,000,000 to carry out a study to develop such a plan; and referring this ordinance to a vote of the qualified electors of the City at the election to be held on November 7, 2000.

 WHEREAS, the electors of the City of Seattle approved Initiative 41 on November 4, 1997, creating a public corporation called the Elevated Transportation Company ("ETC"); and

 WHEREAS, Initiative 41 chartered the ETC to build, maintain, and operate a 40-mile electrically powered, rubber tired and principally elevated mass transportation system along specified routes and with the locations of many stations specified; and

 WHEREAS, Initiative 41 provided that the ETC should attempt to locate private funding to carry out its goal of building the monorail system described in the initiative; and

 WHEREAS, the ETC was unable to locate any significant private funding to advance the monorail system proposed in Initiative 41; and

 WHEREAS, City funds would be required to pay most of the construction and finance costs of a 40-mile citywide monorail system; and

 WHEREAS, the City Council enacted Ordinance 120049, which amended Initiative 41, dissolved the Elevated Transportation Company as a public corporation and formed an advisory committee called the Elevated Transportation Committee; and

 WHEREAS, proponents circulated petitions for Initiative Measure 53, which also concerns the planning, funding and possible construction of a monorail system; and

 WHEREAS, the King County Division of Records and Elections certified on September 13, 2000 that the petitions bore a sufficient number of valid signatures to qualify the proposed initiative for enactment by the City Council or submission to the qualified electors of the City of Seattle for their approval or rejection (C.F.No. 304012); and

 WHEREAS, the City Council may, pursuant to City Charter Section IV.1.D, submit Initiative 53 to a vote of the qualified electors of the City of Seattle; and

 WHEREAS, the City Attorney prepared the following ballot title for Initiative 53:

 The City of Seattle Initiative Measure Number 53 concerns the planning,

 funding and possible construction of a monorail system.

 This measure would require the City to provide $6,000,000 to fund operation of the Elevated Transportation Company, including preparation of a monorail funding and construction plan. The measure outlines required elements of the plan, which would be implemented if approved by voters. The City also would be required to reserve up to $200 million in councilmanic bonding capacity, to be used for monorail construction if voters approved the plan. A transit authority would supervise system construction and operation.

 NOW THEREFORE, BE IT ORDAINED BY THE CITY OF SEATTLE AS FOLLOWS:

 Section 1. Statement of Legislative findings.

 1. The costs of Monorail systems built or under construction within the last 15 years along public rights-of-way in the United States and abroad, for which information is presently available, range from $25 million to $232 million per mile; and

 2. Cost estimates for the construction of a monorail system in Seattle range from $35 million to $90 million or more per mile; and

 3. Assuming a middle range of $40 million to $80 million per mile, total costs for a 40-mile citywide system would range from $1.6 billion to $3.2 billion;

 4. The City's councilmanic debt capacity is insufficient to allow the City to borrow, without voter approval, the funds necessary to build a 40-mile citywide monorail system; and

 5. Voter-approved bonds and additional City taxes to repay those bonds would be required to pay most of the construction and finance costs of a 40-mile citywide monorail system; and

 6. To build a 40-mile citywide monorail system financed by property taxes, City property taxes would need to be increased by about 59% to 118% (about $570 to $1141 in additional taxes per year for the average home now valued at $262,000) for 20 years.

 7. The City Council recognizes that this ordinance is a different measure dealing with the same subject and in conflict with Initiative Measure No. 53, as those terms are used in City Charter Sections IV.1.D and IV.1.G, and that therefore this ordinance should be submitted to the qualified electors of Seattle for their consideration on the same ballot with Initiative Measure 53.

 Section 2. The City of Seattle is authorized to develop a plan, including a finance plan, for a city-wide monorail system of approximately 40 miles in length serving the four quadrants of the City of Seattle. Consistent with Ordinance No. 120049, the Elevated Transportation Committee shall have only an advisory role in developing this plan.

 Section 3. An appropriation of $6,000,000 is hereby authorized to carry out the study to develop such a plan for such a monorail system.

 Section 4. No City funds shall be appropriated to the Elevated Transportation Company to develop the monorail plan described in Initiative 53.

 Section 5. Alternative Conflicting Measure. This ordinance is a different and conflicting measure dealing with the same subject as Initiative Measure No. 53, as those terms are used in City Charter Sections IV.1.D and IV.1.G. This ordinance should therefore be submitted to the qualified electors of Seattle for their consideration on the same ballot with Initiative Measure 53. This ordinance is hereby referred as an alternative ballot measure to a vote of the qualified electors of the City at the special election being held in conjunction with the general election to be held on November 7, 2000.

 Section 6. Ballot Measure. The King County Director of Records and Elections, as ex officio supervisor of elections, is hereby requested, in conjunction with the state general election on November 7, 2000, to submit to this alternative ballot measure to the qualified electors of the City. The City Clerk is hereby authorized to take those actions necessary to submit, pursuant to City Charter Article IV, Section 1.D, this alternative ballot measure to the qualified electors of the City of Seattle for their approval or rejection at the special municipal election to be held in conjunction with the November 7, 2000 state general election. The Executive Director of the Ethics and Elections Commission is authorized to take the steps necessary to produce a voters' pamphlet for the election, including for this alternative measure.

 Section 7. Ballot Title and Explanatory Statement. The City Attorney shall prepare the ballot title and explanatory statement for this alternative measure as provided by applicable law.

 Section 8. Effective Dates. Sections 1, 2, 3, and 4 of this ordinance shall go into effect only if this alternative measure is approved by the qualified electors of the City of Seattle, but if both this conflicting alternative measure and Initiative 53 should both be approved, sections 1, 2, 3, and 4 of this ordinance shall go into effect only if this alternative measure receives a greater number of affirmative votes than does Initiative Measure No. 53.

 Section 9. Except as provided in Section 8, this ordinance shall take effect and be in force immediately upon approval of the ordinance by the Mayor or, if is not approved and returned by the Mayor within ten (10) days after presentation, then on the eleventh (11th) day after its presentation to the Mayor or, if vetoed by the Mayor, then immediately after its passage over his veto.
