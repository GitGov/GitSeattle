 AN ORDINANCE relating to technology expenditures; appropriating funds and increasing the expenditure allowance in the 2000 budget of the Department of Information Technology for the purpose of managing fiber optic projects with other governmental agencies; and allowing the Department of Information Technology to receive reimbursement from the other agencies who are parties to the agreements for the costs attributable to them; all by a three-fourths vote of the City Council.

 WHEREAS, sharing of fiber optic cable can promote governmental efficiency and the development of access to the public schools is important to leveraging technology in education; and

 WHEREAS, the City Council has adopted Resolution 29076 which establishes principles and conditions for shared fiber optic cable projects among public agencies and adopted General Terms & Conditions for fiber-sharing agreements between the City and other public entities by Ordinance 117981; and

 WHEREAS, the Seattle School District, the University of Washington, the Seattle Community College District and other City of Seattle departments ("partner agencies") have requested the development of additional fiber cables, some in conjunction with private telecommunication facility construction; and

 WHEREAS, the partner agencies have requested that the Department of Information Technology serve as the lead agency for these projects based on its record of project management; and

 WHEREAS, the partner agencies have committed to reimburse their shares of the cost of these projects, including the cost of project management and fiber maintenance; and

 WHEREAS, the Department of Information Technology will require additional expenditure authority to be able to fulfill these requests; and NOW, THEREFORE,

 BE IT ORDAINED BY THE CITY OF SEATTLE AS FOLLOWS:

 Section 1. The costs associated with the Fiber Projects for the benefit of the City of Seattle shall be paid from appropriations in the 2000 Budgets of the Department of Information Technology, Seattle

 Transportation, Seattle Public Utilities, the City Light Department, and the Executive Services Department, without using the appropriation authority in section 3 of this ordinance.

 Section 2. At any stage of this Project, any public agency that is not initially a participant in this Project may, if the Chief Technology Officer approves, participate in this Project provided that an agreement that conforms to the principles and terms and conditions of the Project Agreement, as described in Ordinance 117981, is executed, and provided that addition of any such agency does not create additional net cost to the City. Project modifications consistent with the intent of the Project, which may include the addition of elements for public agencies participating in the Project, such as additional building entrances or fiber terminations paid for by the requesting agency or agencies, may proceed provided the budget authorizations (including that made in Section 3 of this ordinance) are sufficient to complete the Project without additional net cost to the City.

 Section 3. Amounts received from other participating agencies under existing or subsequent Agreements pursuant to Ordinance 117981 or this ordinance shall be deposited in the ESD Operating Fund. The amount of One Million Seven Hundred Fifty Thousand Five Hundred Dollars ($1,750,500) or so much thereof as has been received or shall be received by the City on or before December 31, 2000 from payments from other participating agencies under the Agreements pursuant to this ordinance or Ordinance 117981 is hereby appropriated from such Fund for the purpose of implementing the fiber

 sharing projects, including the addition of elements for other participating public agencies. Contingent upon the receipt of such payments, the expenditure allowance in the 2000 budget of the Department of

 Information Technology (Summit Code A4) is increased by the amount of One Million Seven Hundred Fifty Thousand Five Hundred Dollars ($1,750,500), for the purpose of capital outlay for the acquisition of conduit and fiber optic cables for the use of the participating public agencies. All funds received by the City from payments on additional elements added pursuant to Section 2 of this ordinance are already included in the appropriation under the terms of this Section, and are subject to the maximum dollar amount and time limitation set forth above.

 Section 4. Any acts done consistent with and prior to the effective date of this ordinance are hereby ratified and confirmed.

 Section 5. The foregoing appropriations are made to meet actual necessary expenditures of the City for which insufficient appropriation has been made due to causes which could not reasonably have been foreseen at the time of the making of the 2000 Budget, in accordance with RCW 35.32A.060.

 Section 6. This ordinance shall take effect and be in force thirty (30) days from and after its approval by the Mayor, but if not approved and returned by the Mayor within ten (10) days after presentation, it shall take effect as provided by Municipal Code Section 1.04.020.
