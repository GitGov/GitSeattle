 Early Implementation Fund

 Evaluation using Criteria established in Resolution 29783

 Applicant: South Lake Union Planning Committee

 Amendment to Original Early Implementation Proposal

 Criterion 1: The project must be a high priority element of a proposed neighborhood plan that has been through the community validation process or a neighborhood plan for which the Council has taken final action on the approval and adoption package. The project must be discrete and have a defined product or outcome that is likely to be completed within two years. Funds may be used as seed money for conceptual or detailed engineering design, or for a phase of a project.

Mercer On/Off Ramp Landscaping Project - This project is a high priority of the neighborhood plan and advances Key Strategy T 02 and T 03. The project will supplement site grading and preparation for the landscaped portions the Mercer On/Off Ramps to be completed in the summer of 2000. The project will fund purchase of landscape materials and/or erosion control measures to complement site grading and preparation. Early Implementation funding will be supplemented by private funding to be raised in the neighborhood by a new community based non-profit organization. This project replaces the Parking Study for the South Lake Union Area authorized under the original EIF Ordinance #119488. SEATRAN budget authority will be increased by $15,000, and a 1999 budget allocation of $15,000 to OED for the previously approved South Lake Union Area Parking Study shall be rescinded.

 Criterion 2: The project must be consistent with the Comprehensive Plan. The project must also be consistent with other adopted City plans, such as the Seattle Comprehensive Transportation Program and the Parks COMPLAN. If the project is subject to City regulatory standards, the project must meet or appear capable of meeting those standards.

 The project is consistent with the Comprehensive Plan.

 Criterion 3: The project requires no or minimal increases in City staff or City contribution for ongoing operation and maintenance. The project must not duplicate an existing or planned project already included in a departmental CIP or operating budget.

 SEATRAN will contract for the purchase of landscape materials and coordinate with the neighborhood on installation.

 Criterion 4: If the project is to be implemented by an entity other than the City, the entity must demonstrate that it has the capacity to implement the project in a timely manner, and propose measures the City can use to hold the entity accountable.

 The City is the implementing entity for this project.

 Any further conditions for this applicant:

 None.

 Amendment to Original Early Implementation Proposal

 Criterion 1: The project must be a high priority element of a proposed neighborhood plan that has been through the community validation process or a neighborhood plan for which the Council has taken final action on the approval and adoption package. The project must be discrete and have a defined product or outcome that is likely to be completed within two years. Funds may be used as seed money for conceptual or detailed engineering design, or for a phase of a project.

Green Street/Streetscape/Gateway/Green Space Project - This project is an extension of activities C4, C6, C7, NT2, NT4 and NT9 in the matrix. The project proposes to develop conceptual designs for 9th Avenue, Terry Street, Westlake, and Lenora as funding allows. The concepts may include, if appropriate, angle parking, medians, curb bulbs, pedestrian lighting, amenities such as benches and garbage cans, gateway elements, and identification of street right-of-way that can be developed as open space. Funds not expended for design may be used in construction/implementation/acquisition of specific streetscape and open space elements. This project is scheduled for completion by December 2000. SEATRAN's budget authority will be increased by $4,000 and a 1999 budget allocation of $4,000 to DON for the previously approved Alley Lighting Plan Project under Ordinance #119608 shall be rescinded. This $4,000 allocation shall be added to the $45,000 previously added to SEATRAN's budget for this project under Ordinance #119608.

Alley Lighting Plan Project - This project has been dropped by request of the neighborhood and funding ($4,000) will be added to the Green Street/Streetscape/Gateway/Green Space Project described above.

 Criterion 2: The project must be consistent with the Comprehensive Plan. The project must also be consistent with other adopted City plans, such as the Seattle Comprehensive Transportation Program and the Parks COMPLAN.
