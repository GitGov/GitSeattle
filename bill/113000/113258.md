 Attachment B Proposed Homelessness programs to Receive Funding

 Hammond House/ Compass Center This shelter opened November 25, 1998 for 25 women. Construction, currently nearing completion, will expand the shelter to accommodate 40 women. Renovation costs for Hammond House have exceeded original estimates. $85,651 will help cover a portion of these capital costs.

 Gethsemane Lutheran Church/Lutheran Compass Center Gethsemane Lutheran Church has provided shelter for homeless women and men during crisis times and has coordinated their efforts with the Lutheran Compass Center, SHARE/WHEEL and Operation Nightwatch. This request would provide for emergency shelter in the large basement of Gethsemane with staff assistance from the Lutheran Compass Center for 25 people from June - December, 2000. The cost for operating the shelter is $81,000.

 First Avenue Service Center/Operation Nightwatch Due to unstable funding this emergency shelter for 75 men will close May 31, 2000. HSD has supported a small percentage of this program's costs through Emergency Shelter Grant funds in the amount of $7680 to support operational costs from October to March.

 The program has been able to raise funds to stay open through June this year. The City's share for keeping the shelter open for the balance of 2000 (6 months) is $15,000 and assumes leveraging dollars from other private sources.

 Municipal Building Men's Shelter / Downtown Emergency Center (DESC)

 DESC has operated an emergency winter shelter (October through March) for 50 men in the Municipal Building for many years. The need for shelter does not end with winter. This request would allow the shelter to operate from June through September until their funding for winter weather becomes available. The operating cost for four months is $58,000.

 First Covenant Church Shelter/Cooperative Community Ministry First Covenant Church operated a pilot project for emergency shelter for 25 women from March 15 - May 15, 2000. Funding is requested for the continuation of a faith based cooperative effort with HSD to operate an emergency shelter for up to 25 women for the balance of 2000. The cost for six months using this model is $32,649.

 Women's Referral Center Meal Program / Archdiocesan Housing Authority Due to the loss of funding the meal program will close in early June, 2000. It currently serves 70 meals each evening to homeless women and began operating in February 1999. The operating cost of maintaining the meal program from June 1 - December 31, 2000 is $25,000.

 Service Links for Youth/University Street Ministry This request would continue City support for outreach and case management for homeless youth and young adults that was initiated last year in response to community residents interest in providing viable housing options for people displaced from Cowan Park. Funding ended May 15, 2000. The program exceeded the original goals engaging nearly 50 youth in case management and helping 33 enter more stable housing. The cost of keeping the program going through the end of the year is $42,200.
