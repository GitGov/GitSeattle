 WHEREAS, the terrorist attacks in New York City, Washington D.C. and Pennsylvania on September 11, 2001 have resulted in a congressional authorization for Use of United States Armed Forces and the subsequent activation of reservists from all branches of the United States Armed Forces and the National Guard; and

 WHEREAS, City of Seattle employees who are members of the military reserves and the National Guard have been and will be activated in response to such declaration; and

 WHEREAS, the City of Seattle wishes to maintain uninterrupted health care coverage for such employees and their dependents;

 NOW THEREFORE,
