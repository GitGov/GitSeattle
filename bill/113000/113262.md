 International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers (I.B.E.W.), Local 77

 On June 16, 1999, Local 77 requested a wage review for the Relay Electri cian job classification series at Seattle City Light (SCL). The Collect ive Bargaining Agreement authorizes the formation of a Wage Review Commi ttee at the request of the Union.

 The City of Seattle Classification/Compensation Unit undertook a review of external market comparisons for the Relay Electrician series. The an alysis was completed and information shared with representatives from Lo cal 77 on February 29, 2000.

 The parties agree that there are difficulties in the recruitment and ret ention of qualified Relay Electricians. Therefore, the parties agree to a wage adjustment of two percent (2.0%) for the Relay Electrician serie s, including Relay Electrician Crew Chi ef. The increase will be retroactive to January 19, 2000.

 This Agreement will become effective after it is signed and legislation endorsing the agreement is enacted by the City Council and signed by the Mayor.

 Agreed and Signed this _________ day of March 2000.
