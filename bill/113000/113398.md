 23.45.015 Screening and landscaping requirements-Lowrise zones.

 C. Tree Requirements in Landscaped Areas in Lowrise Duplex/Triplex, Lowrise 1, and Lowrise 2 zones.

 1. Trees shall be required when new ~~low-rise~~lowrise  multifamily dwelling units are constructed. This requirement may be met using options in subsection C1a or C1b below. The minimum number of caliper inches of tree required per lot may be met through using either the tree preservation option or tree planting option set forth below, or through a combination of preservation and planting. Trees within public and private rights-of-way may not be used to meet this standard.

 a. Tree Preservation Option. For lots over three thousand (3,000) square feet, at least two (2) caliper inches of existing tree per one thousand (1,000) square feet of lot area must be preserved. On lots that are three thousand (3,000) square feet or smaller, at least three (3) caliper inches of existing tree must be preserved per lot. ~~Trees within public and private rights-of-way may not be used to meet this standard.~~ When this option is used, a tree preservation plan is required.

 b. Tree Planting Option. For lots over three thousand (3,000) square feet, at least two (2) caliper inches of tree per one thousand (1,000) square feet of lot area must be planted. On lots that are three thousand (3,000) square feet or smaller, at least three (3) caliper inches of tree must be planted per lot.

 2. Tree Measurements. Trees planted to meet the requirements in subsection C1 above shall be at least one and one-half (1.5) inches in diameter. The diameter of new trees shall be measured (in caliper inches) six ~~(6)-inches~~(6) inches above the ground. Existing trees shall be measured four and one-half (4.5) feet above the ground. When an existing tree is three (3) to ten (10) inches in diameter, each one (1) inch counts as one (1) inch toward meeting the tree requirements in subsection C1 above. When an existing tree is more than ten (10) inches in diameter, each one ~~(1)-inch~~(1) inch of the tree that is over ten (10) inches shall count as three (3) inches toward meeting the tree requirement.

 3. Tree Preservation Plans. If the tree preservation option is chosen, a tree preservation plan must be submitted and approved. The plan may be submitted as part of the overall landscaping plan for the project. Tree preservation plans shall provide for protection of trees during construction according to standards promulgated by the Department of Design, Construction and Land Use.

 E. Exceptions.

 1. Streets With Existing Curbs.

 a. Streets With Right-of-way Greater Than or Equal to the

 Minimum Right-of-way Width. When a street with existing curbs abuts a lot, and improvements would be required by subsections B or D of this section, and the existing right-of-way is greater than or equal to the minimum width established in subsection A of this section, but the roadway width is less than the minimum established in the Street Improvement Manual, the following requirements shall be met:

 (1) All structures on the lot shall be designed to accommodate the grade of the future street improvements.

 (2) A no-protest agreement to future street improvements shall be required, as authorized by RCW Chapter 35.43. The agreement shall be recorded with the title to the property with the King County Department of Records and Elections.

 (3) If there is no sidewalk, a sidewalk shall be constructed, except when the following projects are proposed:

 i. Remodeling and use changes within existing structures;

 ii. Additions to existing structures which are exempt from environmental review.

 b. Streets With Less Than the Minimum Right-of-way Width.

 When a street with existing curbs abuts a lot and the existing right-of-way is less than the minimum width established in subsection A6 of this section, the following requirements shall be met:

 (1) Setback Requirement. A setback equal to half the difference between the current right-of-way width and the minimum right-of-way width established in subsection A6 of this section shall be required; provided, however, that if a setback has been provided under this provision, other lots on the block shall provide the same setback. The area of the setback may be used to meet any development standard, except that required parking may not be located in the setback. Underground structures which would not prevent the future widening and improvements of the right-of-way may be permitted in the required setback by the Director ~~of Construction and Land Use~~ after consulting with the Director of Transportation.

 (2) Grading Requirement. When a setback is required, all structures on the lot shall be designed to accommodate the grade of the future street, according to the Street Improvement Manual.

 (3) A no-protest agreement to future street improvements shall be required, as authorized by RCW Chapter 35.43. The agreement shall be recorded with the title to ~~tile~~ the property with the King County Department of Records and Elections.

 2. Projects With Reduced Improvement Requirements. The following types of projects are exempt from all dedication and improvement requirements of subsections B, C and D of this section, but shall meet the setback, grading and no-protest requirements of subsection E1b if the street right-of-way abutting the lot has less than the minimum right-of-way width established in subsection A of this section or does not meet the grade of future street improvements.

 a. Structures with fewer than ten (10) artist's studio dwellings;

 b. The following uses when they are smaller than seven hundred fifty (750) square feet of gross floor area: fast-food restaurants; major and minor vehicle repair uses; and multipurpose convenience stores;

 c. Nonresidential structures which have less than four thousand (4,000) square feet of gross floor area and which do not contain uses listed in subsection~~s~~ E2b ~~and E2c~~ of this section which are larger than seven hundred fifty (750) square feet;

 d. Structures containing a mix of artist's studio dwellings and nonresidential uses, if there are fewer than ten (10) artist's studio dwellings, and the square footage of nonresidential use is less than specified in subsections E2b and E2c of this section;

 e. Remodeling and use changes within existing structures;

 f. Additions to existing structures which are exempt from environmental review; and

 g. Expansions of a surface parking area or open storage area of less than twenty (20) percent of parking area or storage area or number of parking spaces.

 3. Exceptions From Required Street Improvement Requirements. The Director may waive or modify the requirements for paving, dedication, setbacks, grading, no-protest agreements, landscaping and sidewalk and pedestrian walkway installation when it is determined that one (1) or more of the following conditions are met:

 a. Location in an environmentally critical area, disruption of existing drainage patterns, or removal of natural features such as significant trees makes widening and/or improving the right-of-way impractical or undesirable.

 b. The existence of a bridge, viaduct or structure such as a substantial retaining wall makes widening the right-of-way impractical or undesirable.

 c. Widening the right-of-way and/or improving the street would adversely affect the character of the street, as it is defined in an adopted neighborhood plan or adopted City plan for street parks, boulevards, or other special right-of-way, or would otherwise conflict with the stated goals of such a plan.

 d. Widening and/or improving the right-of-way would make building on a lot infeasible by reducing it to dimensions where development standards cannot reasonably be met.

 e. Widening and/or improving the right-of-way would eliminate street access to an existing lot.

 f. One (1) or more substantial principal structures on the same side of the block as the proposed project are located in the area needed for future expansion of the right-of-way and the structure(s)' condition and size make future widening of the remainder of the right-of-way unlikely.

 g. Widening and/or improving the right-of-way is impractical because topography would preclude the use of the street for vehicular access to the lot, for example due to an inability to meet the required twenty (20) percent maximum driveway slope.

 h. Widening and/or improving the right-of-way is not necessary because it is adequate for current and potential pedestrian and vehicular traffic, for example, due to the limited number of lots served by the development or because the development on the street is at zoned capacity.

 Section 42. Section 23.55.032 of the Seattle Municipal Code, which Section was last amended by Ordinance 113263, is hereby repealed.

 Section 43. Subsection D of Section 23.60.454 of the Seattle Municipal Code, which section was last amended by Ordinance 113466, is amended as follows:
