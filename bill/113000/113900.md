 WHEREAS, a majority of such caregivers provide assistance for between one and four years, and 20% provide care for five years or longer; and

 WHEREAS, research has demonstrated that such caregivers need and can benefit from a range of support services including information about their work and issues in providing care, transportation to medical and other appointments, respite so that they may take breaks for personal needs, education and training to build skills, access to trained counselors for one-on-one assistance at critical times and other services; and

 WHEREAS, the reauthorization of the Older Americans Act included a new service component and funding for a National Family Caregiver Support Program and such funding has been allocated through the Washington State Department of Social and Health Services, Aging and Adult Services Administration to the Human Services Department's Aging and Disabilities Services; Now, Therefore,
