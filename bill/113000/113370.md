 AN ORDINANCE relating to the City Light Department; amending Seattle Municipal Code, Chapter 21.49, to enact a power cost adjustment increasing rates for the use of electricity.

 WHEREAS, Ordinance 119747, passed by the City Council on November 23, 1999, established rates for the sale of electricity by the Department for the period beginning December 24, 1999; and

 WHEREAS, the rates established by Ordinance 119747 effective December 24, 1999 assumed that the Department would incur net costs of $2.2 million in calendar year 2000 and $14.5 million in calendar year 2001 through its purchases and sales of power in the wholesale power market and the use of surplus energy to displace purchases of power from the Bonneville Power Administration and generation at the Centralia Steam Plant; and

 WHEREAS, the price of energy in the wholesale power market has been at historically high levels in 2000, and has been particularly high in those months when the Department needs to purchase energy in order to serve load in the Seattle service area; and

 WHEREAS, wholesale market prices are expected to remain at high levels into 2001, exposing the Department to further variability in its financial results; and

 WHEREAS, the Department now expects to incur net costs of $53.9 million in 2000 and $15.8 in 2001 as a result of its activity in wholesale power markets; and

 WHEREAS, financial results in 2000 and 2001 would be far below the targets used in setting rates unless action is taken to increase revenues; and

 WHEREAS, the Department has proposed that rates be adjusted to include a power cost adjustment effective January 1, 2001; and

 WHEREAS, since revenues derived from the power cost adjustment are intended to offset the effect of excess power costs in 2000 and 2001, it is appropriate to defer a portion of such excess power costs from 2000 to 2001 so that the costs so deferred and the offsetting revenues from the power cost adjustment can be accounted for in the same fiscal period; and

 WHEREAS, the Department has recommended deferring up to $38 million of projected excess power costs from calendar year 2000 to calendar year 2001; and

 WHEEREAS, the Department is in the process of negotiating a new power sales contract with the Bonneville Power Administration which is expected to make additional power available to the Department and reduce the need to purchase power in the wholesale market; and

 WHEREAS, the new contract with the Bonneville Power Administration may expose the Department to additional variability in its financial results by increasing the amount of nonfirm energy available to the Department; and

 WHEREAS, increased investments in energy conservation will help reduce total electricity consumption and decrease City Light's reliance on market purchases of energy; and

 WHEREAS, the Department intends to conduct a review of its financial policies in 2001 to determine whether changes in its financial planning guidelines are needed in order to deal with the increased variability of financial results stemming from the new Bonneville contract; and

 WHEREAS, Section 21.49.081 of the Seattle Municipal Code provided that the Department's rates would be adjusted effective October 1, 2001 to recognize the rates adopted by the Bonneville Power Administration for transmission services, once the level of the Bonneville transmission rates were known with certainty; and

 WHEREAS, the Bonneville Power Administration has now adopted specific transmission rate increases, and the pending 24.3%, increase in the Department's Bonneville transmission costs are incorporated into the rate changes for October 1, 2001 set forth in this ordinance, and Section 21.49.081 therefore can be deleted; NOW THEREFORE,

 BE IT ORDAINED BY THE CITY OF SEATTLE AS FOLLOWS:

However, if the Department determines that it is either uneconomical or impractical to meter at the service voltage level, the Department will meter at the distribution voltage level and will either program the meter to deduct computed transformer losses or will reduce the monthly kWh billed by the amount of the discount for transformer losses.

 If the customer elects to receive service from the Department's available distribution system voltage of four (4) kV or higher, metering will be at the distribution voltage level and the discounts for transformer losses, if applicable, and for transformer investment, if applicable, will be applied to the customer's billings. However, if the Department determines that it is either uneconomical or impractical to meter at the distribution voltage level, the Department will meter at the service voltage level and the discount for transformer losses will not be applicable.

 Transformer losses in kWh - 1756 + .53285 x kW + .00002 x kW2+ .00527 x kWh

 Transformer investment - $0.17 per kW of monthly maximum demand

 B. For customers metered on the primary side of a transformer, the Department will either program the meter to deduct computed transformer losses or provide a discount for transformer losses by reducing the monthly kWh billed by the number of kWh computed in Section 21.49.055, subsection A.

 C. For customers who provide their own transformation from the Department's standard distribution system voltage of four (4) kV, thirteen (13) kV, or twenty-six (26) kV to a utilization voltage, a discount for transformer investment will be provided in the amount stated in Section 21.49.055, subsection A.

 D. The Department will provide one (1) transformation from the available distribution system voltage of four (4) kV or higher to a standard service voltage, and metering normally will be at the service voltage level. However, if the Department determines that it is either uneconomical or impractical to meter at the service voltage level, the Department will meter at the distribution voltage level and will either program the meter to deduct computed transformer losses or will reduce the monthly kWh billed by the amount of the discount for transformer losses.

 If the customer elects to receive service from the Department's available distribution system voltage of four (4) kV or higher, metering will be at the distribution voltage level and the discounts for transformer losses, if applicable, and for transformer investment, if applicable, will be applied to the customer's billings. However, if the Department determines that it is either uneconomical or impractical to meter at the distribution voltage level, the Department will meter at the service voltage level and the discount for transformer losses will not be applicable.

 Schedule VRC (Variable Rate General Service)

 Schedule VRC is an optional rate schedule for high demand general service provided to customers eligible to be served under Schedule HDC. A customer that chooses this rate schedule may not return to a standard rate schedule for a period of one (1) year after electing this schedule, provided that, should a new rate ordinance which changes Schedule VRC be adopted during this time, the customer may request return to a standard rate schedule upon the effective date of the new ordinance.

 At the time a customer elects to take service under Schedule VRC, the customer must choose whether to pay an energy charge as defined in Option 1 - DJ-COB or Option 2 - DJ Mid-Columbia. After choosing an energy charge option, a customer may not choose a different energy charge option for a period of one (1) year except that, should a new rate ordinance which changes Schedule VRC be adopted during this time, the customer may request a change in energy charge option upon the effective date of the new ordinance or may request return to a standard rate schedule upon the effective date of the new ordinance.

 (DJ-COB price in cents /kWh - 0.07 cents /kWh) x 1.1562 + 0.15 cents /kWh

 The DJ-COB (Dow Jones-California Oregon Border) price is the appropriate peak or off-peak DJ-COB nonfirm price converted to cents per kWh for the day and time period of the consumption. Peak and off- peak periods will be as defined by the DJ-COB price rather than as defined in the Demand Charges section of Schedule VRC or elsewhere in the ordinance codified in this section. In the case that a price is not available for a given day, the average of the preceding and following days' prices will be used. Peak and off-peak prices will be calculated separately via this method.

 Option 2 - DJ Mid-Columbia

 DJ Mid-Columbia Price in cents /kWh x1.1562 + 0.15 cents /kWh

 The DJ Mid-Columbia (Dow Jones Mid-Columbia) price is the appropriate peak or off-peak DJ Mid-Columbia price index converted to cents per kWh for the day and time period of the consumption. This index is an average of firm and nonfirm transactions. Peak and off-peak periods will be as defined by the DJ Mid-Columbia price index rather than as defined in the Demand Charges section of Schedule VRC or elsewhere in this section. In the case that a price is not available for a given day, the average of the preceding and following days' prices will be used. Peak and off-peak prices will be calculated separately via this method.

For customers who provide their own transformation from the Department's standard distribution system voltage of four (4) kV, thirteen (13) kV, or twenty-six (26) kV to a utilization voltage, a discount for transformer investment will be provided in the amount stated in Section 21.49.058, subsection A. Existing customers served by the Department's 34.5 kV system as of January 1, 1995 shall be considered as receiving standard distribution voltage for the purpose of this section. This 34.5 kV voltage will not be offered as a standard distribution system voltage for any new customers.

 D. Customers must provide hourly load schedules each day for the following day. If a customer's load follows a regular pattern, the Department may, at its discretion, waive this requirement and request only to be informed of temporary or permanent changes to the pattern.

 E. The Department may request voluntary load interruption during an emergency. If interruption occurs, the demand charge will be waived for the billing period in which the interruption occurs.

 F. Customers who request service under Schedule VRC will be selected solely at the option of Seattle City Light.

 G. Customers served under Schedule VRC shall provide Seattle City Light with access to their telephone equipment and pay any initial and ongoing charges for additional telephone equipment needed for the Department to communicate with its metering equipment.

 Section 8. The provisions of this ordinance are declared to be separate and severable. If any one or more of the provisions of this ordinance shall be declared by any court of competent jurisdiction to be contrary to law, then such provision or provisions shall be null and void and severed from the rest of this ordinance, and all other provisions of this ordinance shall remain valid and enforceable.

 Section 9. Reviewing Current Financial Policies.

 City Light shall present to the Energy and Environmental Policy Committee by March 31, 2001 a detailed assessment of whether its current financial policies are adequate to manage the risks associated with its current resource portfolio, as well as its recent and planned acquisitions (including the BPA Slice product, the Klamath Falls combustion turbine, and anticipated renewable resources). This assessment will also include an analysis of City Light's approach to managing its remaining market risks and a discussion of the Utility's approach towards buying and selling energy in the 'spot market' versus longer-term forward contracts. Financial policies should be considered in relation to these power purchase and sales strategies so that the two work together to provide adequate financial stability. In the event that current financial policies are not adequate, City Light shall develop options for revising them and make recommendations regarding any revisions.

 Section 10. Reporting on Power Cost Adjustment.

 Starting in February of 2001 and continuing on a monthly basis, City Light shall submit to the Energy and Environmental Policy Committee a brief report summarizing its projected power market costs and the incremental revenues generated through the Power Cost Adjustment. This report shall be comparable in form to the table attached hereto as attachment A. Appropriate explanatory text will be included with this report. Formal briefings regarding the status of the Power Cost Adjustment will be scheduled by the Chair of the Energy and Environmental Policy Committee.

 Section 11. Conservation Funding

 One percent (1%), up to a cumulative maximum of five hundred thousand dollars ($500,000), of the revenues generated from the power cost adjustment that is reflected in the rates authorized in this ordinance shall be used to augment funding of energy conservation programs at Seattle City Light. This additional funding can be used to expand existing efforts such as the Multi-family Conservation Programs and the Built Smart Program, or to develop new conservation initiatives.

 Section 12. This ordinance shall take effect and be in force thirty (30) days from and after its approval by the Mayor, but if not approved and returned by the Mayor within ten (10) days after presentation, it shall take effect as provided by Municipal Code Section 1.04.020.
