 AN ORDINANCE relating to locomotive and train speeds; authorizing the Director of Seattle Transportation to negotiate an agreement for various right-of-way, safety, railroad crossing, and signal improvements; increasing the permitted speeds within the City south of the King Street Station, and amending Chapter 11.66 of the Seattle Municipal Code in connection therewith.

 WHEREAS, The City of Seattle is working with the Central Puget Sound Regional Transit Authority ("Sound Transit"), Burlington Northern/Santa Fe Railroad, and Union Pacific Railroad to increase rail capacity along the Tacoma - Everett rail corridor in order to facilitate Sound Transit's Sounder commuter rail, Amtrak's Cascades passenger rail service, and greater access and mobility for rail transportation of freight and goods in the Puget Sound area; and,

 WHEREAS, Sound Transit and the railroads are committed to making a series of safety improvements along the Tacoma - Seattle rail corridor that will allow them to achieve this increased rail capacity by travelling at an increased speed of up to 50 miles per hour;

 NOW, THEREFORE,

 BE IT ORDAINED BY THE CITY OF SEATTLE AS FOLLOWS:

 Section 1. The Director of Seattle Transportation or the Director's designee is authorized to negotiate an agreement with Sound Transit to provide for the following:

 1. The closure of the street at the rail crossing at Military Road South, contingent upon Sound Transit's pursuit of both funding and construction of a pedestrian and bicycle overpass over the railroad tracks in the vicinity of Military Road South, installation of safety equipment to close the crossing, and the construction of street improvements that will provide adequate access to the commercial property at 8300 Military Road South;

 2. Installation of safety, railroad crossing, and signal improvements at each of the five affected crossings: mainline and side tracks at South Spokane Street, South Horton Street, South Lander Street, South Royal Brougham Way, and mainline, side tracks and yard tracks at South Holgate Street. These improvements may include but are not limited to red light camera enforcement equipment, median islands, quad grade-crossing arms with vehicle- presence detection, pedestrian gate arms, Constant Warning Time system, inter-tie connections linked to adjacent traffic signal equipment to allow traffic signal preemption, and a new rail Central Traffic Control system along the rail corridor.

 Section 2. The Director shall submit to the City Council proposed legislation to increase or decrease the train speed limits at these five crossings based on the safety record along the Tacoma-Seattle rail corridor as provided for in the agreement. The City recognizes that Sound Transit's goal is to increase passenger train speed limits at S. Holgate Street, S. Lander Street, S. Horton Street, and S. Spokane Street to fifty (50) miles per hour to help provide enough capacity in the rail corridor to accommodate increased passenger service.

 Section 3. Section 11.66.120 of the Seattle Municipal Code is amended as follows:

 11.66.120 Locomotive and train limit.

A. No person shall operate any locomotive or train over or across any street at a speed in excess of twenty (20) miles per hour except where:

~~A.~~1.~~Where~~~~t~~The railroad exists on an underpass or overpass; or

~~B.~~2. The Federal Rail Safety Act of 1970 (45 U.S.C. s. 434) or rules of the United States thereunder preempt City authority to set a speed limit on mainline tracks~~; or~~.

~~C.~~3.  Unless preempted, the speed limit shall be forty (40) miles per hour at mainline grade crossing of streets or alleys south of South Spokane Street when signals are in operation.

B.Subsection A shall not apply to the crossings listed in this subsection. For those crossings, the speed limits are as follows:

1.South Holgate Street and South Lander Street: Thirty- five (35) miles per hour for both passenger and freight trains;

2.South Horton Street and South Spokane Street: Forty (40) miles per hour for passenger trains and thirty-five (35) miles per hour for freight trains;

3.South Royal Brougham Way. Twenty-five (25) miles per hour for both passenger and freight trains.

 Section 4. The new speed limits in SMC 11.66.120(B) shall not be implemented until the Director of Transportation has filed with the City Clerk a memorandum stating that the agreed-to improvements and conditions substantially set forth in Attachment A have been completed.

 Section 5. This ordinance shall take effect and be in force thirty (30) days from and after its approval by the Mayor, but if not approved and returned by the Mayor within ten (10) days after presentation, it shall take effect as provided by Municipal Code Section 1.04.020.
