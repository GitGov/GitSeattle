 AN ORDINANCE relating to the City Light Department and to Seattle Public Utilities, authorizing the Superintendent of City Light and the Director of Seattle Public Utilities to acquire parcels of land in the Skagit and the Tolt/Snoqualmie watersheds, to be set aside as salmon habitat.

 WHEREAS, Puget Sound Chinook salmon have been listed as a threatened species by the National Marine Fisheries Service, and Puget Sound bull trout have been listed as a threatened species by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service; and

 WHEREAS, the City has responded to these listings, in part, through the development and implementation of an Early Action Proposal, approved by Council in March, 1999, through Resolution 29905, which includes as salmon conservation strategies: the acquisition of habitat lands in the Skagit and the Tolt/Snoqualmie watersheds, the protection of such habitat lands through easements and restrictive covenants, the restoration of habitat functions on such lands, and research and monitoring efforts essential to such habitat protection and restoration projects; and

 WHEREAS, the Early Action Proposal included spending, over a period of five years, up to $3.35 million in the Skagit watershed and up to $3.3 million in the Tolt watershed, and the 2001-2006 approved Capital Improvement Program includes $ 4.5 million from the Light Fund and $2.15 million from the Water Fund for this purpose, and of these amounts, $4.00 million was targeted for property acquisitions; and

 WHEREAS, $1,066,814 of the Early Action funds have been spent to date for habitat acquisition, restoration, and research and monitoring activities, including $978,000 in the Skagit watershed and $88,814 in the Tolt watershed; and

 WHEREAS, Council has provided supplemental budget authority to Seattle City Light for habitat projects within the Early Action Proposal by approving the acceptance of grant funds in the amount of $900,000 from the National Fish and Wildlife Foundation and $145,000 from the Washington Salmon Recovery Funding Board; and

 WHEREAS, the parcels identified for purchase in this Ordinance meet the purposes of the Early Action Program, which intended to prevent degradation of otherwise pristine land, to enhance prime habitat that would otherwise not be enhanced, and to help build a network of prime habitat locations in partnership with other intersted parties for purposes of salmon recovery in these watersheds and the region; and

 WHEREAS, the City is working cooperatively with the Skagit Watershed Council which has developed a Habitat Protection and Restoration Strategy and a list of candidate property acquisitions; and

 WHEREAS, the City is working cooperatively with the Snohomish Basin Salmon Recovery Forum, which includes within its purview the Tolt/Snoqualmie watershed, and which has produced a Draft Near Term Action Agenda for Salmon Recovery; and

 WHEREAS, there is efficiency to be gained in a single authorization of land purchases and effectiveness to be gained in the ability to complete transactions in a timely manner;

It also provides high quality bull trout and steelhead trout rearing habitat, and steelhead trout spawning habitat. $190,000 negotiated price.

Used for rearing and spawning by chinook, coho, chum, pink salmon, and steelhead trout. Property is "key" parcel needed to protect mouth of channel. Also provides protection to mouth of Gilligan Creek, which is used by chinook, coho, and steelhead for spawning. $60,000 asking price and an appraisal has been ordered.

 Darland Property (Ross Island), lower Skagit River. Located adjacent to Hinds Property. Critical off-channel habitat for rearing and spawning by chinook, coho, chum, pink salmon, and steelhead trout. The property is not formally on the market and an appraisal has not been initiated.

 Failla Property, Sauk River. Extremely high quality habitat for chinook salmon, steelhead trout, and bull trout. Approximately 115 acre parcel provides over one mile of critical side-channel habitat to fish. Property received highest ranking among properties reviewed by Skagit Watershed Council.

 Attachment B.

 Chinook Salmon Conservation in the Tolt/Snoqualmie River Basin

 City of Seattle Habitat Acquisition Targets

 Stephens Property. Tax Parcel 222507-9003. 20 Acres. This parcel is located in King County, abutting the City of Carnation on its north boundary. It is comprised primarily of floodplain, with a developable portion of about 3 acres located behind a bank stabilization and flood protection levee in the northwest corner. A dry side channel runs through property, which also includes an active river bank of gravel and cobble substrate. The property is adjacent to other, similar floodplain properties that are being pursued for habitat protection jointly with the City of Carnation and King County. Negotiated price is $120,000.

 Kearns Property. Tax Parcels 152507-9058 and 222507-9058. Total 7.85 acres. These parcels are adjacent to and downstream of the Stephens Property. They are also located in King County, abutting the City of Carnation. They involve primarily floodplain land that is protected by a levee but forms an essential link in the river corridor that may be considered for future levee relocation. Price estimate to be determined through appraisal, which has not been completed.

 Shumer Property. Tax Parcel 142507-9053. 0.75 Acre. This parcel is located in King County, situated between the Tolt River and the Tolt River Road. It is one of a sequence of "recreational" parcels in this area generally believed to be undevelopable because of their floodplain location. Asking price is $36,950, and an appraisal has not been completed.

 Recreational Parcels. Southernmost Parcel 112507-9045. Northernmost Parcel 122507-9031. Range 0.38-1.0 Acres. These 18 parcels are located in King County on the south (left) bank of the Tolt in the active floodplain. Taken together, they are sandwiched between two larger parcels owned by Weyerhaeuser Company. Recent sales among these parcels have ranged from $100 to $10,000, and no appraisals have been completed.

 Kappenman Property. Tax Parcels 112507-9020 and 112507-9094. 23 acres total. These two properties are in King County on the north (right) bank of the Tolt and are nearly entirely in the floodplain. Together, they have about 40 feet of river frontage and significant side channels, in an area vulnerable to active channel migration. Major portions of the property lie just behind small recreational parcels, some of which are developed with cabins. Price estimate to be determined through appraisal, which has not been completed.

 Latuseck Property. Tax Parcels 865680-0140 and 865680-250. 3.9 acres total. These two properties are also in King County on the north (right) bank of the Tolt and are entirely in the floodplain. Together they have about 250 ft. 0f river frontage. These parcels lie a short way upstream of the Kappenman Property and could form a portion of a significant reach-scale protected area in the future. Asking price is $35,000 and an appraisal has not been completed.
