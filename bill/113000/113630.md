 ORDINANCE __________

 AN ORDINANCE relating to the Department of Parks and Recreation; finding the transfer of certain park property necessary and authorizing the exchange of certain City-owned property for equivalent other property to be improved as park land.

 WHEREAS, certain land was identified in the 1891 Plat of Beacon Place as "Beacon Park;" and, in 1896, was deeded to the City of Seattle and accepted "for park purposes;" and, in 1922, such land was named Wittler Park, in honor of the dedicators of the plat;

 WHEREAS, such land was never developed or improved as public park land; nor was adjacent public street right-of-way, now known as 11th Avenue South, ever improved for street purposes

 WHEREAS, the existence of the unimproved street right-of-way and the undeveloped park land, together with other physical constraints of the land, has hindered the development, improvement, and use of the adjacent private property; and

 WHEREAS, the Department of Parks and Recreation and the adjacent private property owners were co-petitioners to the City Council requesting the vacation of 11th Avenue South; and, on June 26, 2000, the City Council granted approval of the petition (Clerk File 303360), subject to certain conditions, including the development of a relocated park; and

 WHEREAS, a land trade involving the park land and the portions of vacated street right-of-way attaching thereto will accommodate development, improvement, and use of the adjacent lands, both public and private; and

 WHEREAS, in accordance with the requirements of Ordinance 118477 (a.k.a, Initiative 42), the City Council has held a public hearing regarding the necessity of this action; and the City has identified land to replace the park property, such land being equivalent or better in size, value, location and usefulness and in the same vicinity, serving the same community and the same park purpose as the park land to be transferred;

 NOW, THEREFORE,

 BE IT ORDAINED BY THE CITY OF SEATTLE AS FOLLOWS:

 Section The City Council finds that the transfer of certain park property in exchange for equivalent or better property is necessary because there is no reasonable and practical alternative.

 Parcel identified as "Beacon Park" in the Plat of Beacon Place Addition, as recorded in Volume 8 of Plats, Page 15, Records of King County, Washington; together with underlying interest in those portions of adjacent 11th Avenue South which would, through street vacation, attach thereto by operation of law.

 And to accept, in return, for park, recreation, and open space purposes, the following described property from Koh Family LLC and/or ABCD Trust

 The westerly 75 feet of Lots 26 - 30, inclusive, Beacon Place Addition, as recorded in Volume 8 of Plats, Page 15, Records of King County, Washington, less those portions condemned for street purposes.

 Section 3. Any act consistent with the authority and prior to the effective date of this ordinance is hereby ratified and confirmed.

 Section 4 This ordinance shall take effect and be in force thirty (30) days from and after its approval by the Mayor, but if not approved and returned by the Mayor within ten (10) days after presentation, it shall take effect as provided by Municipal Code Section 1.04.020.
