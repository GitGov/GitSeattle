 RESTRICTIVE COVENANT, EASEMENT AND CONTRACT CONCERNING REAL PROPERTY

 This Restrictive Covenant, Easement and Contract Concerning Real Property ("Covenant and Easement") is entered into as of this ___ day of ______, 2001 by and between Washington State Convention and Trade Center, a public corporation of the State of Washington ("WSCTC" or "Grantor") and The City of Seattle, a municipal corporation of the State of Washington ("City" or "Grantee").

 RECITALS

 1. The WSCTC has entered into a Library Lease (as hereinafter defined) with the Board of Trustees of Seattle Public Library to use the Facility (as hereinafter defined) as a public library through December 19, 2003 (subject to extensions through June 19, 2004), when a permanent downtown central library is expected to open.

 2. The WSCTC has entered into a Purchase and Sale Agreement (as hereinafter defined) with the Historical Society of Seattle and King County, a Washington non-profit corporation d/b/a the Museum of History and Industry ("MOHAI") with regard to MOHAI's purchase of the Museum Parcel (as improved with the Facility and Library Improvements (as defined in the Library Lease) following termination of the Library Lease. Following its acquisition, MOHAI is expected to remove certain Library Improvements and make further improvements to the Facility for use as an Historical Museum (as hereinafter defined), and to open the museum to the public.

 3. The City recognizes that an Historical Museum has substantial educational and cultural value to Seattle residents by promoting a greater understanding of the history, industry and cultures of the Pacific Northwest region, and further recognizes that this value is maximized if the broadest possible cross section of the City's residents, schools and certain non-profit organizations have easy access to an Historical Museum.

 4. Because of the greater size and accessibility of the Facility (in downtown Seattle with greater availability of public transportation) in comparison to the existing MOHAI Historical Museum located at 2700 24th Avenue East, Seattle, the Facility would be accessible to a far greater number of visitors and would allow greater exhibition and meeting space than does the existing Historical Museum.

 5. The City wishes to ensure that in the future the City and its residents will enjoy the above-noted advantages of an Historical Museum located at the Facility.

 NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the above-recited benefits to the City as Grantee, Payment by the City to WSCTC as Grantor of Five Hundred Thousand Dollars ($500,000) as provided in Section 23 below, and other good and valuable consideration, the WSCTC and City agree as follows:

 A. Subject to the requirements of this Section 4.A, Grantee, in its sole discretion, may extend the Initial Term of this Covenant and Easement for two consecutive extension periods, the first for a period of eight (8) years and the second for a period of four (4) years. In order to exercise either such right to extend, Grantee shall provide Grantor with written notice of its election to extend and pay Grantor the sum of One Million Dollars ($1,000,000) for the first extension and Five Hundred Thousand Dollars ($500,000) for the second extension as consideration for such extensions. The first extension payment must be received by Grantor on or before July 1, 2002 and the second on or before July 1, 2003. In the event Grantee exercises its rights to extend in accordance with this Section 4.A, Grantor and Grantee shall promptly execute a written confirmation of such extension in recordable form, and either Grantor or Grantee may record such written document with the King County Recorder's Office.

 B. This Covenant and Easement shall terminate, and all easements, covenants and obligations in it shall be of no further force or effect upon the earliest to occur of:

 (i) The expiration of the Term; or

 (ii) Prior to the beginning of the Use Period, the date on which Grantee receives full reimbursement in accordance with the following: (a) Grantor may so terminate this Covenant and Easement at any time by giving Grantee thirty (30) days prior written notice and by reimbursing all Payments paid by Grantee hereunder (including without limitation Payments for all extensions of the Initial Term) ; (b) Grantor shall so terminate this Covenant and Easement on or before December 21, 2003 if MOHAI has not taken title to the Museum Unit by such date, by giving Grantee five (5) days prior written notice and reimbursing all Payments made by Grantee hereunder (including without limitation Payments paid for all extensions of the Initial Term); or (c) Grantor shall so terminate this Covenant and Easement on or before February 1, 2007 if an Historical Museum in the Museum Shell is not open to the public by January 1, 2007, by giving Grantee five (5) days prior written notice and reimbursing all Payments made by Grantee hereunder (including without limitation Payments paid for all extensions of the Initial Term); or

 (iii) After the beginning of the Use Period, the date on which Grantee receives full reimbursement in accordance with the following: Grantor may so terminate this Covenant and Easement at any time by giving Grantee thirty (30) days prior written notice and reimbursing the amount equal to all Payments made by Grantee hereunder (including without limitation Payments made for all extensions of the Initial Term) multiplied by the ratio of the unused months in the Use Period to the total months in the Use Period . For example, if Grantee has paid $2,000,000 for a four (4) year Use Period under the Initial Term plus both extensions totaling twelve (12) years (for a total Use Period of sixteen (16) years or one hundred ninety-two (192) months) and if the effective date of the termination under this Section 4.B(iii) occurs at the end of the tenth year (i.e., end of month one hundred twenty (120) of the Use Period), the amount to be reimbursed would be Seven Hundred Fifty Thousand Dollars ($750,000); or

 (iv) Upon a termination pursuant to Section 9, 13 or 23 hereof.

 No documentation or other action shall be required to confirm a termination of this Covenant and Easement in accordance with this Section 4.B, and any such termination shall be automatic and self- operative. However, upon the request of either party, Grantor and Grantee shall execute and deliver a Memorandum of Termination in recordable form, which shall confirm the date of termination of this Covenant and Easement. Either Grantor or Grantee may record such Memorandum of Termination with the King County Recorder's Office.

 C. In addition to the amounts required to be paid under Section 4.B above, interest shall accrue on the Payments for the first and second extensions from the date such Payment was made by Grantee until the date of full reimbursement at the rate as described below, and shall be paid as part of the required termination payment:

 i. If the reimbursement is made before MOHAI takes title to the Museum Unit, then (a) no interest shall accrue on the first $500,000 Payment; and (b) interest shall accrue on the Payments for the first and second extensions at the rate per annum equal to the Escrow Rate in effect from time to time.

 ii. If the reimbursement is made after MOHAI takes title to the Museum Unit, then interest shall accrue on all Payments at the rate per annum applied from time to time to participating funds in the Consolidated Cash Portfolio of Grantee.

 D. Grantor agrees to place the Payments made by Grantee for the first and second extensions under Section 4A. into an escrow with the title insurance company that has issued a preliminary commitment to insure the Museum Unit upon its purchase by MOHAI or another escrow agent acceptable to Grantor and Grantee. The parties agree to instruct the escrow agent to place the funds in an account that earns the highest interest of the investments offered by the escrow agent consistent with the investment restrictions under which Grantee and Grantor operate. The parties will enter into an escrow agreement with such escrow agent, providing that if this Covenant and Easement is terminated before MOHAI completes its purchase of the Museum Unit, then Grantee's Payments for the first and second extensions and interest thereon at the Escrow Rate shall be paid to Grantee as part of the termination payment required under Section 4.B. (The remaining portion of the termination payment shall consist of the $500,000 first Payment made hereunder, on which no interest shall accrue.) MOHAI and WSCTC will be amending the Purchase and Sale Agreement to provide that the escrow funds will count as earnest money payments due to WSCTC thereunder.

 Section 5. Condominiumization of Facility

Grantee consents to the actions described in the preceding sentence and agrees that the Declaration shall be a permitted exception under this Covenant and Easement. In addition, Grantor and Grantee covenant and agree that when the Declaration is recorded and the Museum Unit is created, (i) the term "Facility" as used in this Covenant and Easement shall mean and refer to that structure located on and within the Museum Unit, excluding the Museum Shop, (ii) this Covenant and Easement and the easements, covenants, restrictions and obligations in it shall pertain to and be covenants running with the Museum Unit, (iii) this Covenant and Easement and the easements, covenants, restrictions and obligations in it shall not encumber, run with or pertain in any manner to the WSCTC Air Unit or the WSCTC Ground Unit, (iv) the term "Grantor" shall mean the owner of the Museum Unit, and (v) although the provisions of this sentence shall be self-operative, upon the request of either party, Grantor and Grantee shall execute and deliver an amendment or restatement of this Covenant and Easement in recordable form which shall confirm the provisions of this sentence and which may be recorded by either party with the King County Recorder's Office.

 B. As a condition of the Transfer of the Museum Unit to MOHAI, Grantor shall require MOHAI to grant a deed of trust to Grantee at closing to secure MOHAI's obligations to make the payment to terminate this Covenant and Easement under Section 4.B(ii)(c) hereunder. Such deed of trust shall be in form and substance shall be substantially as set forth in Exhibit E, and a draft of same shall be delivered to Grantee for its review and approval (based on conformity to Exhibit E) at least ten (10) days prior to execution. Such executed deed of trust shall be delivered to Grantee on or prior to the Transfer. As a condition of closing, such deed of trust shall be duly recorded with King County. Grantor shall cause the costs of recording to be paid by Transferee. Such deed of trust shall be subject and subordinate only to the permitted exceptions set forth in Exhibit D hereto, the Declaration and any purchase money or construction loans that may be obtained by MOHAI. Grantee shall release the deed of trust if and when an Historical Museum is first opened to the public in the Museum Unit. Grantee agrees that if it obtains ownership of the Facility through purchase at foreclosure sale, Grantee shall use the Facility and the improvements therein, and permit the Facility and the improvements therein, to be used only for those uses that are (i) permitted by Governmental Requirements, (ii) do not emit or create excessive noise or offensive odor and (iii) not otherwise inconsistent with or detrimental to the operation, use and enjoyment of the Convention Center Expansion or the Existing Convention Center by its users and occupants.

If the Transfer has not been made in accordance with this Covenant and Easement, Grantor shall continue to be bound by all of its obligations hereunder.

 Section 9. Damage or Destruction

 If the Facility is destroyed or damaged by fire or other casualty during the Term of this Covenant and Easement and Grantor does not commence restoration or rebuilding of the Facility within eighteen (18) months after the event of casualty loss, then Grantor shall reimburse all Payments that Grantee shall have made hereunder (including without limitation Payments made for extensions of the Initial Term) without interest, provided that if such casualty loss occurs during the Use Period, said amounts to be reimbursed shall be multiplied by the ratio of the unused months in the Use Period to the total months in the Use Period.

 Eligible School: An accredited primary or secondary school located in Seattle.

 Eligible School Group: A group of not-to-exceed thirty (30) students, with accompanying teachers or other adults, from an Eligible School, attending the Facility as part of an organized Eligible School function.

 Occasion: A four (4) hour period (or any part thereof) during which Grantee uses or has reserved the right to use the portions of the Facility described in Section 2 below. Grantee may schedule use of the Facility for a full eight hour day as two (2) Occasions. For example, Grantee's use of two meeting rooms for one three (3) hour period would constitute one Occasion.

 Seattle Resident: A person whose primary residence is in Seattle.

 2. Grantee Functions and Events

 A. On ten (10) Occasions during each Use Year (with the number of Occasions prorated for Partial Use Years, rounded to the nearest whole number), upon making a reservation therefor, Grantee shall have the exclusive use of any conference rooms, meeting rooms and similar rooms in the Facility for City-sponsored functions and events. In addition, Grantor may, in its sole discretion, make the auditorium/theater and other space in the Facility available for use by Grantee.

 B. For each use of the Facility by the Grantee under this Exhibit Section 2 during the regular hours of operation of the Facility, Grantor will not charge Grantee for Grantor's normal operation (during Grantor's business hours) of or overhead (including without limitation utilities, taxes, assessments) on the Facility. Normal operations include but are not limited to turning on and off all lighting, adjusting climate controls, turning on and adjusting the public address system, providing access to the Facility and its public rooms, locking and unlocking doors, HVAC and other systems as necessary, providing janitorial service and securing the Facility after each such use, and providing all necessary information concerning the operations and policies of the Facility. If Grantee desires to use the Facility on an Occasion that does not occur during the Facility's regular hours of operation or if Grantee desires technical or specialized assistance that Grantor agrees to provide, Grantor may charge Grantee the rates which normally would be charged by the Grantor for such space or services under arms-length arrangements.

 C. Grantee shall observe rules adopted by Grantor respecting the manner of use of the Facility for all persons other than Grantor. Grantee shall be liable for any injury to persons, damage to the Facility or its contents, and any other claim, expense or liability incurred by Grantor, other than normal wear and tear, caused by the acts or omissions of Grantee, its agents, employees, contractors or invitees in connection with uses by Grantee pursuant to this Exhibit Section 2.

 D. The scheduling of Grantee functions and events at the Facility shall be arranged as follows:

 (i) Grantor shall, at least thirty (30) days in advance of the start of each Use Year or Partial Use Year, provide to Grantee a written schedule showing the dates and times when conference and meeting rooms in the Facility will be available for use by Grantee pursuant to this Exhibit Section 2. Such schedule is subject to reasonable change by Grantor. If Grantor desires to change the schedule, it shall promptly inform Grantee. Once Grantee has made a reservation as provided below, Grantor shall not enter into any agreements or commitments for the use of the Facility that, individually or in the aggregate, would preclude it from reasonably accommodating the Grantee's use rights under this Exhibit Section 2, and Grantor shall not rescind a scheduled date after it has been reserved by Grantee pursuant to Exhibit Section 2.D(ii).

 (ii) The Grantee shall contact the Grantor before scheduling an event at the Facility, to confirm its availability. If the date, time and particular space are available, the Grantor shall confirm such availability and shall irrevocably reserve the date and time requested. If the date and time requested by the Grantee are not available, then unless otherwise agreed to by the Grantee, the Grantor shall offer an equivalent date and time within thirty (30) days after the date originally requested. Unless Grantee cancels its reservation at least thirty (30) days in advance, the reservation shall be considered an Occasion of use, whether or not Grantee actually uses the space.

 E. If Grantee uses the Facility on fewer than ten (10) Occasions in any Use Year or the proportionate number of Occasions in any Partial Use Year, the balance shall carry forward and shall increase the minimum number of uses to which the Grantee is entitled in the following Use Year, but in no event shall the total number of uses by the Grantee under this Exhibit Section 2 exceed twelve (12) Occasions per Use Year.

 C. Cultural Diversity

 Grantor shall create and maintain at the Facility, throughout the Use Period, an ongoing exhibit (which may be part of a larger exhibit) or periodic programs on the cultural diversity of Seattle. Such exhibit may consist of one permanent exhibit or a series of temporary exhibits provided that there is an exhibit on diversity on display at all times (except for brief periods necessary to change or refurbish such exhibit). Alternatively, Grantor may provide educational programs on cultural diversity, so long as such programs occur at least four times during each Use Year.

 4. Use and Access by Seattle Residents and Schools

 A. Free Days for All Seattle Residents

 At least once each month throughout the Use Period, Grantor shall offer free admission to the Facility (including all open exhibits, but not including special private or fund-raising events) to all Seattle Residents. Grantor shall make good-faith efforts to publicize the free admission days. These efforts shall include, without limitation, prominently posting the schedule of free days at the Facility and including notice of free days in written museum advertising and literature. Free admission required under this Exhibit Section 4.A shall be in addition to all other obligations of Grantor under this Covenant and Easement.

 B. Free Access by Eligible School Groups

 (i) Throughout the Use Period Grantor shall offer half price admission (off of the general public admission price for children of the same age) to the Facility to all Eligible School Groups, for up to and including five (5) such groups per day. If fifty percent (50%) of the students in an Eligible School meet the qualifications of the United States National School Lunch Program, there shall be no admission charge at any time.

 (ii) Reduced price or free admission to Eligible School Groups shall include access to all exhibits and activities during normal hours of operation of the Facility.

Such admission shall be granted, on a "first come, first served" basis, provided that the total number of Eligible School Groups shall not exceed five (5) per day. Grantor shall make good-faith efforts to publicize reduced price and free admission for Eligible School Groups. These efforts shall include without limitation prominently posting notice of this service at the Facility, and including such in written advertising and literature. The free and reduced price admissions required under this Exhibit Section 5.B shall be in addition to all other obligations of Grantor under this Covenant and Easement.

 5. Donation Admission

 Throughout the Use Period, Grantor shall have a policy of donation-based access for persons unable to pay the full entrance fee. Such donation admission shall mean that any person seeking admission on any day that the museum is open to the public shall be able to pay only what that person can afford for admittance.

 Exhibit E

 After recording return to: City of Seattle ____________ _____________ Seattle, WA 98104 Attn:_________ Deed of Trust

 Grantor: The Historical Society of Seattle and King County Grantee: The City of Seattle Abbreviated legal description: Assessor's Tax Parcel No.:

 This Deed of Trust is made this _____ day of ______, 200_, between The Historical Society of Seattle and King County, a Washington nonprofit corporation, Grantor, whose address is __________________________, Washington, and ____________, Trustee, whose address is _________________________, Washington, and The City of Seattle, a municipal corporation of the State of Washington, Beneficiary, whose address is ______________________.

 WITNESSETH: Grantor hereby bargains, sells and conveys to Trustee in Trust, with power of sale, the following described real property in King County, Washington:

 (Legal description not included since the Declaration has not yet been recorded.)

 (the "Property"), which real property is not used principally for agricultural or farming purposes, together with all the tenements, hereditaments, and appurtenances now or hereafter thereunto belonging or in any wise appertaining, and the rents, issues and profits thereof.

 By this Deed of Trust, Grantor expressly conveys its present fee interest in the Property, together with any after-acquired interest it may obtain.

 This Deed of Trust is for the purpose of securing the obligation of Grantor to make a payment to Grantee in the amount of $2,000,000, plus interest as provided in the Covenant and Easement (as hereafter defined), to terminate the Covenant and Agreement under Section 4.B(ii)(c) thereof if an Historical Museum is not open to the public in the Property by January 1, 2007. The "Covenant and Easement" is the Restrictive Covenant, Easement and Contract Concerning Real Property recorded under King County Recording No. _______ (the "Covenant and Easement").

 1. To protect the security of this Deed of Trust, Grantor covenants and agrees:

 A. To keep the Property to permit no waste thereof; to complete any improvements being built by Grantor in the Property; and to comply with all laws, ordinances, regulations, covenants, conditions and restrictions affecting the Property.

 B. To pay before delinquent all lawful taxes and assessments upon the property; to keep the Property free and clear of all other charges, liens or encumbrances impairing the security of this Deed of Trust (other than the Permitted Encumbrances described on Exhibit B hereto).

 C. To keep all improvements constructed by Grantor now or hereafter erected on the Property described herein continuously insured against loss by fire or other hazards in an amount not less than the total debt secured by this Deed of Trust, to the extent not insured by the owner's association for the condominium of which the Property is part. All policies shall be in such companies as the Beneficiary may approve and have loss payable first to the Beneficiary as its interest may appear and then to the Grantor. Subject to the rights of the prior lender on the Property and the condominium declaration for the Property, the amount collected under any insurance policy may be applied upon any indebtedness hereby secured in such order as the Beneficiary shall determine. Such application by the Beneficiary shall not cause discontinuance of any proceedings to foreclose this Deed of Trust. In the event of foreclosure, all rights of the Grantor in insurance policies then in force shall pass to the purchaser at the foreclosure sale.

 D. To defend any action or proceeding purporting to affect the security hereof or the rights or powers of Beneficiary or Trustee, and to pay all costs and expenses, including cost of title search and attorney's fees actually incurred, as provided by statute.

 E. To pay all costs, fees and expenses in connection with this Deed of Trust, including the expenses of the Trustee incurred in enforcing the obligations secured hereby and Trustee's and attorneys' fees incurred.

 F. Should Grantor fail to pay when due any taxes, assessments, insurance premiums, liens, encumbrances or other charges against the Property hereinabove described, Beneficiary may (but is not obligated to) pay the same, and the amount so paid, with interest at the applicable rate set forth in the Covenant and Easement secured hereby, shall be added to and become a part of the debt secured in this Deed of Trust.

 2. In the event any portion of the Property is taken or damaged in an eminent domain proceeding, subject to the rights of the prior lender on the Property and the condominium declaration for the Property, the entire amount of the award or such portion thereof as may be necessary to fully satisfy the obligation secured hereby, shall be paid to Beneficiary to be applied to said obligation.

 3. By accepting payment of any sum secured hereby after its due date, Beneficiary does not waive its right to require prompt payment when due of all other sums so secured or to declare default for failure to so pay.

 4. The Trustee shall reconvey all or any part of the Property covered by this Deed of Trust to the person entitled thereto, on written request of the Grantor and the Beneficiary, or upon satisfaction of the obligation secured (i.e., upon expiration or earlier termination of the Covenant and Easement) and written request for reconveyance made by the Beneficiary or the person entitled thereto. This Deed of Trust shall terminate and Beneficiary shall request reconveyance of this Deed of Trust if an Historical Museum (as defined in the Covenant and Easement) is open to the public by January 1, 2007.

 5. Upon default by Grantor in the payment of any indebtedness secured hereby or in the performance of any agreement contained herein or in the Covenant and Easement, and in the event such default becomes a Default as defined in the Covenant and Easement, all sums secured hereby shall immediately become due and payable at the option of the Beneficiary. In such event and upon written request of Beneficiary, Trustee shall sell the trust property in accordance with the Deed of Trust Act of the State of Washington, at public auction to the highest bidder. Any person except Trustee may bid at Trustee's sale. Trustee shall apply the proceeds of the sale as follows: (i) to the expense of the sale, including a reasonable Trustee's fee and attorney's fee; (ii) to the obligation secured by this Deed of Trust; (iii) the surplus, if any, shall be distributed to the persons entitled thereto.

 6. Trustee shall deliver to the purchaser at the sale its deed, without warranty, which shall convey to the purchaser the interest in the Property which Grantor had or had the power to convey at the time of its execution of this Deed of Trust, and such as Grantor may have acquired thereafter. Trustee's deed shall recite the facts showing that the sale was conducted in compliance with all the requirements of law and of this Deed of Trust, which recital shall be prima facie evidence of such compliance and conclusive evidence thereof in favor of bona fide purchasers and encumbrances for value.

 7. The power of sale conferred by this Deed of Trust and by the Deed of Trust Act of the State of Washington is not an exclusive remedy; Beneficiary may cause this Deed of Trust to be foreclosed as a mortgage.

 8. In the event of the death, incapacity, disability or resignation of Trustee, Beneficiary may appoint in writing a successor trustee, and upon the recording of such appointment in the mortgage records of the county in which this Deed of Trust is recorded, the successor trustee shall be vested with all powers of the original trustee. The trustee is not obligated to notify any party hereto of pending sale under any other Deed of Trust or of any action proceeding which Grantor, Trustee or Beneficiary shall be a party unless such action or proceeding is brought by the Trustee.

 9. This Deed of Trust applies to, inures to the benefit of, and is binding not only on the parties hereto, but on their heirs, devisees, legatees, administrators, executors, successors and assigns.

 10. This Deed of Trust shall be subject and subordinate to a deed of trust on the Property obtained by Grantor for the purpose of financing the acquisition of the Property and construction of the Historical Museum improvements in the Property. At the request of such prior lender, Beneficiary shall execute a subordination and intercreditor agreement reasonably required by such prior lender.

 The term Beneficiary shall mean the Grantee under the Covenant and Easement secured hereby, whether or not named as Beneficiary therein.

 The Historical Society of Seattle and King County, a Washington nonprofit corporation
