 ORDINANCE _________________

 AN ORDINANCE related to the disposition of City-owned property in the South Lake Union area; appropriating funds from the Cumulative Reserve Subfund for expenses therewith; and directing that future proposed legislation include provisions to reimburse the Cumulative Reserve Subfund from proceeds of said disposition, all by a three- fourths vote of the City Council.

 WHEREAS, encouragement of the redevelopment of City-owned properties in the South Lake Union area to provide a gateway to Seattle is a high priority of the Mayor and Council; and

 WHEREAS, the South Lake Union Neighborhood Plan, adopted by City Council in March 1999, calls for the encouragement of redevelopment of City properties in the Mercer Corridor area; and

 WHEREAS, the Council passed Resolution 30080 outlining public objectives and directing the Executive Services Department to issue a Request for Qualifications for the Disposal and encouragement of redevelopment of the surplus City-owned properties in the area; and

 WHEREAS, the Council passed Resolution 30045 authorizing the Director of the Executive Services Department to allocate on a reimbursable basis up to $100,000 from the Cumulative Reserve Subfund as appropriated by Ordinance 119482, for certain preliminary costs associated with the disposal and encouragement of redevelopment of City properties located adjacent to South Lake Union; and

 WHEREAS, the Council passed Ordinance 119867 authorizing the Director of the Executive Services Department to allocate on a reimbursable basis up to $185,000 from the Cumulative Reserve Subfund for transaction-related expenses; and

 WHEREAS, in order to continue work on this project involving capital improvements, the City must obtain additional information on the appraised highest and best use valuation of the involved parcels under any negotiated agreement; clarify the context of environmental documents thereby augmenting their utility to facilitate south lake union redevelopment; continue negotiation with the selected developer; and prepare a letter of intent and transaction agreements for the disposition; and

 WHEREAS, such appraisals, environmental documentation clarification, negotiation guidance, and document preparation costs are estimated to be $104,000 in the year 2000; and

 WHEREAS, among the possible scenarios are the disposition of City property of over 200,000 square feet and the acquisition of other property needed for transportation improvements at a net potential financial gain well in excess of $389,000 to the City; and

 WHEREAS, the City Council desires that all of the work items described above be reimbursed from such disposition proceeds; Now therefore,

 BE IT ORDAINED BY THE CITY OF SEATTLE AS FOLLOWS

 Section 1. As requested by the Director of the Executive Services Department and recommended by the Mayor, the sum of One Hundred and Four Thousand Dollars ($104,000) is hereby appropriated from the Cumulative Reserve Subfund, Unrestricted Subaccount (00164), for the South Lake Union Redevelopment project (A17075) and the Director of the Executive Services Department is authorized to expend the same.

 Section 2. As part of a proposed legislative package to authorize any sale, trade, or other transaction involving said properties, the Director of the Executive Services Department is requested to include in a proposed ordinance, provisions to reimburse total expended Cumulative Reserve Subfund funds to the fullest extent legally allowable, not to exceed Three Hundred and Eighty-nine Thousand Dollars ($389,000), from net proceeds from any sale, trade, or other transaction from said properties.

 Section 3. The appropriation in Section 1 above is made to meet actual necessary expenditures of The City of Seattle for which no appropriation has been made due to causes which could not have reasonably been foreseen at the time of the adoption of the 2000 budget.
