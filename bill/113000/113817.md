 ORDINANCE __________________

 AN ORDINANCE relating to land use and zoning, adding a new subsection to SMC 23.54.020 to allow required accessory parking spaces to be leased to City-recognized car-sharing programs.

 WHEREAS, the City of Seattle and King County seek to expand the transportation alternatives of citizens who choose not to own cars by sponsoring car-sharing programs, such as Flexcar, which assist the City in meeting goals to reduce the number of privately owned vehicles; and

 WHEREAS, the impact of allowing accessory parking to be leased to City-recognized car-sharing programs will be offset by the reduction in car ownership that such programs make possible; and

 WHEREAS, City-recognized car-sharing programs such as Flexcar rely on efficient dispersion of their vehicle stations to be within walking distance of their members who use the vehicle, thus ensuring against high concentrations of accessory parking spaces leased to car-sharing programs; and

 WHEREAS, the City's adopted Transportation Strategic Plan recommends developing on-street and off-street parking options for car-sharing vehicles;

 NOW THEREFORE,

 BE IT ORDAINED BY THE CITY OF SEATTLE AS FOLLOWS:

 Section 1. A new subsection J is added to Section 23.54.020 of the Seattle Municipal Code, which Section was last amended by Ordinance 119239, to read as follows:

 23.54.020 Parking quantity exceptions.

 J. Parking for City-recognized car-sharing programs. One (1) space or up to five (5) percent of the total number of spaces, whichever is greater, may be used to provide parking for vehicles operated by a City-recognized car-sharing program. The number of required accessory parking spaces will be reduced by one (1) space for every parking space leased by a City-recognized car-sharing program.

 Section 2. This ordinance shall take effect and be in force thirty (30) days from and after its approval by the Mayor, but if not approved and returned by the Mayor within ten (10) days after presentation, it shall take effect as provided by Municipal Code Section 1.04.020.
