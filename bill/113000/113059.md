 ORDINANCE __________________

 AN ORDINANCE relating to land use and zoning, amending Ordinance 119394 by extending the date of the expiration of the Station Area Interim Overlay District, Chapter 23.70 of the Seattle Municipal Code, until September 1, 2000.

 BE IT ORDAINED BY THE CITY OF SEATTLE AS FOLLOWS:

 Section 1. The City Council hereby makes the following legislative findings of fact:

 a) On March 3, 1999, Ordinance 119394 was passed to establish the Station Area Interim Overlay District. The District established interim regulations applicable within approximately 1/4 mile of proposed light rail stations. Within the District, certain uses incompatible with transit-oriented development are prohibited and revised parking and access standards for uses in Commercial 1/ Commercial 2 zones are established.

 b) By adopting the Interim Overlay District, the City Council ensured that the City's station area planning process could proceed without vesting of rights to establish uses incompatible with the City's station area planning goals.

 c) Ordinance 119394 is scheduled to expire on March 1, 2000.

 d) In order to allow station area planning to be completed, the City Council finds it necessary to extend the duration of the Interim Overlay District for an additional six months. The Council therefore finds that the protection of the public health, safety, and welfare requires extending the overlay district through September 1, 2000.

 Section 2. Section 5 of Ordinance 119394 is hereby amended to read:

 This Ordinance expires ~~March 1, 2000~~September 1, 2000.

 Section 3. This ordinance shall take effect and be in force thirty (30) days from and after its approval by the Mayor, but if not approved and returned by the Mayor within ten (10) days after presentation, it shall take effect as provided by Municipal Code Section 1.04.020.
