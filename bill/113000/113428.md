 ORDINANCE________________

 AN ORDINANCE relating to the Office of Housing; changing the planned use of land purchased with Urban Renewal program income; approving the sale of Parcels 33 and 34 in the I-90 Redevelopment Project area to Andrew Branch; authorizing the Housing Director to execute and administer a Contract for Sale of Land and Deed; designating the disposition of sales proceeds; and ratifying and confirming prior actions.

 WHEREAS, the City's Department of Community Development, with the participation of community representatives, prepared and presented to the Seattle City Council proposed guidelines ("I-90 Area Development Policies") for the use and development of certain publicly-owned property in the I-90 corridor, which the City Council adopted in Resolution 27901; and

 WHEREAS, during the original planning stages for I-90 Area redevelopment, Andrew L. Branch (hereinafter "Purchaser," which term includes any assignee permitted under the Contract authorized herein) proposed to purchase and to develop two such lots together with adjoining private property for an expansion of an existing nursing home facility to include a congregate care facility, which development plans were approved by the I-90 Development Advisory Committee; and

 WHEREAS, the I-90 Area Development Policies recommend sale of Parcels 33 and 34 (hereinafter "the Parcels") for development of the proposed congregate care facility as a special case, if the Purchaser were to obtain financing for such facility, and otherwise identify those parcels as appropriate for single-family or duplex development; and

 WHEREAS, by Ordinance 118129, adopted May 13, 1996, the City Council authorized payment of the purchase price of the Parcels and appropriated funds therefor from the Urban Renewal Closeout Subaccount of the Housing and Community Development Revenue Sharing Fund in anticipation of use of the Parcels for housing for sale to low or moderate income households; and

 WHEREAS, sale of the Parcels without restrictions on the income of occupant households constitutes a change from the use contemplated in Ordinance 118129, which change requires the City, pursuant to 24 CFR Section 570.505, to provide affected citizens with notice of, and ability to comment on, the proposed change;

 WHEREAS, by Ordinance 119804, the City Council amended the Official Land Use Map to rezone the Parcels and adjoining property from Lowrise Duplex/Triplex to Lowrise 3 and accepted a Property Use and Development Agreement in connection therewith, to implement the Central Area Neighborhood Plan; and

 WHEREAS, the Property Use and Development Agreement accepted by Ordinance 119804 limits use of the affected property, which includes the Parcels if they are acquired by Purchaser, to nursing home, congregate residence, or assisted living facility, as those terms are defined in Title 23 SMC, and imposes further conditions on development in the interest of compatibility with neighboring low-density residential development; and

 WHEREAS, the Purchaser has offered to purchase the Parcels for appraised fair market value and intends to pursue development of a nursing home, congregate residence, assisted living facility or combination thereof, all as permitted by applicable law; and

 WHEREAS, the Director of City's Office of Housing has recommended acceptance of the Purchaser's offer, finding the same consistent with the goals and objectives of the I-90 Area Development Policies, the Central Area Neighborhood Plan, and the Seattle Comprehensive Plan; NOW, THEREFORE,

 BE IT ORDAINED BY THE CITY OF SEATTLE AS FOLLOWS:

 Section 1. The City Council, following public notice and opportunity for comment by affected citizens, finds that use of I- 90 Parcels 33 and 34, legally described in Exhibit A attached hereto (hereafter, the "Parcels"), for development in conjunction with adjoining property of a nursing home, congregate residence or assisted living facility, as permitted by applicable law, is consistent with the I-90 Area Development Policies, the Central Area Neighborhood Plan, and the Seattle Comprehensive Plan; and that a change of use of the Parcels from uses identified in Ordinance 118129 is appropriate, provided that the Housing and Community Development Revenue Sharing Fund is reimbursed for the full fair market value of the Parcels, less the portion of the value attributable to expenditure of other funds for purchase of the Parcels, all as required by 24 CFR Section 570.505.

 Section 2. The sale of the Parcels by the City of Seattle to Andrew Branch, a married man, as his separate estate, for the purpose of development of a congregate care facility or similar facility permitted by applicable law, for the price of ONE HUNDRED THIRTY-FIVE THOUSAND DOLLARS AND NO CENTS ($135,000.00), subject to increase as provided in Section 4 below, is hereby authorized.

 Section 3. The Director of the Office of Housing ("Director") is hereby authorized to execute, deliver and administer for and on behalf of The City of Seattle, a Contract For Sale of Land ("Contract") in substantially the form attached hereto as Exhibit B. The Director is further authorized, for and on behalf of the City, to execute a Special Warranty Deed with Condition Subsequent in substantially the form attached hereto as Exhibit C, for delivery upon satisfaction of the conditions set forth in Section 5 of the Contract.

 Section 4. The Director is hereby designated as the authorized representative of the City in connection with the administration of the Contract and is hereby authorized to approve such changes thereto as are in conformity with the I-90 Area Development Policies and to grant such consents and approvals as she shall deem appropriate to carry out the intent of this ordinance. The Director is authorized to extend the deadline for Closing established in Section 11 of the Contract upon request by Purchaser if, in the Director's judgment, it appears that the Purchaser will not be able to satisfy all conditions by such deadline for reasons not within the control of Purchaser, which may include but are not limited to delays encountered in pursuing and securing tax-exempt bond financing for the Improvements despite diligent and timely efforts of the Purchaser. Any extension shall be made by written amendment of the Contract executed by the City and Purchaser prior to the original deadline for Closing, and only after the Director shall have obtained at City expense a new appraisal, or update of the previous appraisal, of the fair market value of the Parcels, dated within six (6) months of that original deadline. Any such amendment shall provide (a) that the purchase price shall be an amount no less than the estimated fair market value according to such new or updated appraisal (but in any event no less than the price stated in Section 2 of this ordinance); and (b) that if the conditions precedent for Closing have not been met on a specified date acceptable to the Director, no later than the fifth anniversary of the date the Mayor signs this Ordinance, unless because of default by the City, the Contract shall terminate and the City shall retain all earnest money. Any such amendment shall include such additional provisions to further the City's interests in the timely and suitable development of the Parcels as the Director may consider appropriate, which may include interim deadlines for progress toward satisfying conditions. The City Council shall be given notice of a proposed extension at least two weeks prior to execution, and reserves the right to revoke the authorization for any such amendment at any time before the execution thereof.

 Section 5. Proceeds from the sale of the Parcels, net of closing costs paid from escrow, shall be deposited as follows:

 (1) 7.41 percent shall be deposited into the Low Income Housing Fund, Fund 164-40, Project XZADMI90, to reimburse acquisition expenses paid from such account;

 (2) The balance shall be deposited in the Urban Renewal Closeout Subaccount of the Housing and Community Development Revenue Sharing Fund, Fund 178-10, Project XZI70177 to reimburse acquisition expenses paid from such account.

 Section 6. Any act pursuant to the authority and prior to the effective date of this ordinance is hereby ratified and confirmed.

 Section 7. This ordinance shall take effect and be in force thirty (30) days from and after its approval by the Mayor, but if not approved and returned by the Mayor within ten (10) days after presentation, it shall take effect as provided by Municipal Code Section 1.04.020.
