 ORDINANCE ____________________

 AN ORDINANCE relating to the Department of Finance; increasing the expenditure allowance in the 2001 Budget of the Executive Services Department by the appropriation of funds from the Seattle Financial Management Information System Redevelopment Fund; all by a three- fourths vote of the City Council.

 WHEREAS, in 1997 and 1998, the City issued debt and acquired monies from City departments to fund the development of a new Financial Management Information System, commonly known as "Summit"; and

 WHEREAS, Summit's implementation in July 1999 was touted as one of the most successful projects of its kind in that it came in on schedule and was completed for $1.5 million under its $25.6 million total budget; and

 WHEREAS, the Seattle Financial Management Information System Redevelopment Fund (the Redevelopment Fund) is an interest-earning fund; and

 WHEREAS, the Redevelopment Fund was estimated to have $340,000 in unappropriated interest earnings as of December 31, 2000; and

 WHEREAS, the Director of Finance expects the Redevelopment Fund to earn an additional $34,000 in interest earnings prior to the expenditure of its remaining funds in 2001, which will result in an approximate available balance of $374,000; and

 WHEREAS, the City has developed a spending plan to implement critical enhancements to Summit, which will be of great benefit to its users throughout City government; and

 WHEREAS, the Director of Finance has determined that the interest earnings in the Redevelopment Fund are an appropriate fund source to pay for Summit's system enhancements; and

 WHEREAS, the City plans to close the Redevelopment Fund by the end of 2001, and wishes to spend the remaining monies prior to year- end; NOW THEREFORE,

 BE IT ORDAINED BY THE CITY OF SEATTLE AS FOLLOWS:

 Section 1. To pay for continued enhancements to Summit, the City's Financial Management System, the expenditure allowance in the 2001 Adopted Budget of the Executive Services Department is increased as follows:

 by the appropriation, hereby made and authorized, of the sum of Three Hundred Seventy-four Thousand Dollars ($374,000) from the projected unexpended and unencumbered balance in the Seattle Financial Management Information System Redevelopment Fund. If monies in the Redevelopment Fund are less than the above projected amounts, only that portion of the above expenditure allowance that is covered by monies within the Redevelopment Fund will be spent, and the additional appropriation authority will lapse on December 31, 2001.

 Section 2. The foregoing appropriation is made to meet actual necessary expenditures of the City for which no appropriation has been made due to causes that could not reasonably have been foreseen at the time of the adoption of the 2001 Adopted Budget.

 Section 3. Any action taken consistent with the authority and prior to the effective date of this ordinance is hereby ratified and confirmed.

 Section 4. This ordinance shall take effect and be in force thirty (30) days from and after its approval by the Mayor, but if not approved and returned by the Mayor within ten (10) days after presentation, it shall take effect as provided by Municipal Code Section 1.04.020.

 Version 8

Attachment "A"  SUMMIT SPENDING PLAN

July, 2001

 One of the most valuable lessons learned as a result of the Year 2000 (Y2K) problems that the City experienced with its former financial management system, SFMS, was that it is imperative to continually update and improve such systems. Had the City routinely implemented software upgrades to SFMS, the system would have been Y2K compliant. Having learned from this experience, the City has since focused on upgrading and improving its current financial system, "Summit."

 On the heels of the initial implementation of its General Ledger, Project Cost, Accounts Payable, and Purchasing modules, Summit organized a new team and implemented the PeopleSoft Asset Management Module. The Summit team is in the process of upgrading the system software from PeopleSoft version 6.12 to version 7.5. This will take approximately one year to complete and will require some additional outside technical resources to assist City staff. The new version of PeopleSoft will result in functional improvements across all of the modules, and will also provide some increased web functionality.

 Since its implementation, Summit has made numerous improvements to its web reporting capabilities and has offered departments a variety of new ways to access data for analysis and decision support. This includes the development of the St. Helen's database that allows departments to perform their own queries.

 The Summit Steering Committee has approved the following spending plan to allow Summit to continue operating effectively and efficiently in light of its users' needs and the rapidly changing technical environment:

Data Archiving $60,000: Summit has been operational since July, 1999. An archiving strategy has been researched but has not yet been implemented. As a consequence, data is accumulating in the production server and is beginning to create some performance issues. This funding will pay for consulting services and software to implement Summit's archiving strategy.

Production Server Upgrades $70,000: This funding will be used to purchase additional disk storage and memory for Summit's production server to accommodate the growth in the system resulting from the addition of new modules (i.e., Asset Management, Accounts Receivable/Billing), and new users.

Report Environment NT Servers $40,000: This funding will be used to purchase NT servers for Summit web reports.

Report Environment Enhancements $204,000: Summit recognizes the importance of providing departments with effective tools for accessing and analyzing data. As a result, a considerable amount of energy has been spent to improve Summit's reporting environment. This funding will be used to:

 Purchase and install web software and hardware for the production environment.

 Develop a denormalized table combining much of the General Ledger and Budget data, which will greatly assist report developers since they will not have to join tables.

 Complete development of a Data Dictionary for the General Ledger/Budget denormalized table to help users understand Summit data and calculations.
