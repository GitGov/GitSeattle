 BE IT ORDAINED BY THE CITY OF SEATTLE AS FOLLOWS:

 Section 1. Section 2.04.180 of the Seattle Municipal Code, last amended by Ordinance 120145, is amended by adding a new subsection as follows:

 C. 1. In March of each even-numbered calendar year, the Commission shall promulgate a rule in accordance with Chapter 3.02 of the Seattle Municipal Code. This Rule may increase the dollar amount in Subsection A based on changes in economic conditions as reflected by the Implicit Price Deflator for the United States Gross Domestic Product as produced by the United States Department of Commerce Bureau of Economic Analysis ("IPD"). If application of the IPD would result in a decrease in the dollar amount, the dollar amount shall remain unchanged.

 2. The new dollar amounts established by the Commission shall be determined by multiplying a base amount of fifty-five dollars ($55) by the percentage change between the base year of 2000 and the most recently published IPD. The resulting amount shall be added to the base amount, and the amount resulting shall be rounded to the nearest amount convenient for the public. Once adopted, any increase in the cash contribution limit shall be effective for all election cycles that have not ended by May 1 of that even-numbered year.

 3. This subsection shall expire six years after the effective date of the enabling ordinance.

 Section 2. This ordinance shall take effect and be in force thirty (30) days from and after its approval by the Mayor, but if not approved and returned by the Mayor within ten (10) days after presentation, it shall take effect as provided by Municipal Code Section 1.04.020.
