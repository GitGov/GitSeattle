 AN ORDINANCE relating to Land Use Code enforcement amending Seattle Municipal Code Sections 23.90.018 and 23.90.022 to respond to the Superior Court decision in Davis vs. City of Seattle.

 Section 1. Section 23.90.018 of the Seattle Municipal Code, which was last amended by Ordinance 116795, is amended as follows:

 23.90.018 Civil penalty.

 A. In addition to any other sanction or remedial procedure which may be available, any person violating or failing to comply with any of the provisions of Title 23 and who is identified in an order of the Director shall be subject to a cumulative penalty in the amount of Seventy-five Dollars ($75) per day for each violation from the date set for compliance until the ~~order is complied with~~person complies with the requirements of the code, except as provided in subsection B of this section.

 B. Violations of Section 23.71.018 are subject to penalty in the amount specified in Section 23.71.018 H.

 C. The penalty imposed by this section shall be collected by civil action brought in the name of the City. The Director shall notify the City Attorney in writing of the name of any person subject to the penalty, and the City Attorney shall, with the assistance of the Director, take appropriate action to collect the penalty. In any civil action for a penalty, the City has the burden of proving by a preponderance of the evidence that a violation exists or existed; the issuance of the notice of violation or of an order following a review by the Director is not itself evidence that a violation exists.

 D. The violator may show as full or partial mitigation of liability:

 1. That the violation giving rise to the action was caused by the wilful act, or neglect, or abuse of another; or

 2. That correction of the violation was commenced promptly upon receipt of the notice thereof, but that full compliance within the time specified was prevented by inability to obtain necessary materials or labor, inability to gain access to the subject structure, or other condition or circumstance beyond the control of the defendant.

 Section 2. Section 23.90.022 of the Seattle Municipal Code, which was last amended by Ordinance 113978, is amended as follows:

 23.90.022 Additional relief.

 The Director may seek legal or equitable relief to enjoin any acts or practices and abate any condition which constitutes or will constitute a violation of the Land Use Code when civil or criminal penalties are inadequate to effect compliance. In any such action, the City has the burden of proving by a preponderance of the evidence that a violation exists or will exist; the issuance of the notice of violation or of an order following a review by the Director is not itself evidence that a violation exists or will exist.

 Section 3. This ordinance shall take effect and be in full force thirty (30) days from and after its approval by the Mayor, but if not approved and returned by the Mayor within ten (10) days after presentation, it shall take effect as provided by Municipal Code Section 1.04.020.

 Passed by the City Council the ____ day of __________, 2000, and signed by me in open session in authentication of its passage this _____ day of ________, 2000.
