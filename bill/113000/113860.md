 AN ORDINANCE relating to Seattle Transportation's Commuter Services Program, authorizing the Director to establish carpool permit fees.

 WHEREAS, the City wishes to encourage the use of highest occupancy and non-motorized modes of commuting; and

 WHEREAS, current carpool parking fees for the City's public carpool parking are lower than carpool parking fees in private facilities and costs less, per person, than the price of transit fare; and

 WHEREAS, registered vanpools have been shown to be the most cost effective mode for those who commute long distances and for whom mass transit is not available and, because each vanpool removes between eight and fifteen vehicles from our roads and highways each day, it has been decided that they may park in any of the public carpool parking areas for the cost of the permit; and

 WHEREAS, the City wishes to structure its carpool parking fees so that they are not disincentives to the use of public transportation by commuters traveling between areas that are well-served by transit; Now, Therefore,
