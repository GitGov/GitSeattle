In the event that actual deliveries fall short of the Contractor's guaranteed quantities of tonnage at the end of the final quarter of the Contract period, the City, at the election of the Contractor, will make up the shortfall with additional deliveries to the Contractor's 3rd & Lander Transfer Station during the quarter following the end of the Contract.

 g. No adjustments will be made if actual deliveries in a Contract year exceed the Contractor's guaranteed quantities of tonnage.

 Section 135. CDL Transfer/Disposal.

 a. The City reserves, but does not currently exercise, the right to direct the Contractor to any Disposal Facility of its choosing for disposal of CDL collected under this Contract.

 E. COMPENSATION TO CONTRACTOR

 Section 400. Compensation for MSW Container Collection.

 a. Unless otherwise stated in the Contract, the City will compensate the Contractor on a monthly basis for collection from all Commercial customers receiving MSW Container Collection service, based on a per unit schedule defining the payment per collection pickup for each level of service. The per unit payments defined by that schedule will be multiplied by the number of collections of each service level performed by the Contractor during the preceding month, to derive the monthly compensation for Commercial MSW Container Collection.

 b. The initial per unit payment schedule for Container Collection in the first Contract year is shown in Attachment D.

 c. The per unit payment schedule in Attachment D reflects an estimated average weight per cubic yard of 155 pounds for the Contractor's MSW Container Collection customers.

 d. A revised per unit payment schedule for Container Collection will be established after the first contract year and will become the basis for subsequent monthly compensation calculations and for establishing the amount of any true-up adjustments as provided for in Section 408.

 e. The format for Contractor reporting of monthly collection service levels, and overall billing procedures are set forth in Sections 500 through 540.

 Section 403. Compensation for A&E Services.

 a. The City will compensate the Contractor on a monthly basis for A&E Services based on the per unit payment and the types of A&E services listed in Attachment E. The per unit payment defined by that schedule will be multiplied by the number of A&E Services performed by the Contractor during the preceding month, to derive the monthly compensation for A&E Services.

 b. The Contractor will be compensated only for those A&E Services set forth in Attachment E. In setting Rates, however, the City may establish charges to customers for A&E Services which are not set forth in Attachment E, and for which the Contractor would receive no additional compensation.

 c. The format for Contractor reporting of monthly A&E Services, and overall billing procedures are defined in Section 500 through 540.

 d. For the first Contract year, per unit payments for A&E Services will be at the levels listed in Attachment E.

 e. Payment for A&E Services shall be adjusted annually each year of the Contract in accordance with the procedures set forth in Section 470.

 Section 404. Procedure for Establishing Average Weight Per Cubic Yard.

 a. The per unit payments in Attachment D are based on an estimated average weight of 155 pounds per cubic yard for Contractor's Commercial MSW Container Collection customers. The actual average weight per cubic yard will be established based on City-wide data from the first Contract year in accordance with the procedures set forth in this Section, and then will become the basis for adjustments under Section 407 for the remaining term of the Contract.

 b. Average Weight Per Cubic Yard. The average weight per cubic yard will be derived from City-wide data on:

 1. Commercial MSW tonnage collected by the Contractor and the City's other Commercial MSW collection contractor in the City of Seattle from Can Cart and Detachable Container customers from April 1, 2001 through March 31, 2002, and

 2. Cubic yards of subscribed Commercial MSW service and billed Bulky Waste collected by the Contractor and the City's other Commercial MSW collection contractor from Can, Cart and Detachable Container Commercial Waste customers in Seattle from April 1, 2001 through March 31, 2002.

 c. Source of Contractor's MSW Tonnage Data. The source of data on Commercial MSW tonnage collected by the Contractor in Seattle from April 1, 2001 through March 31, 2002 will be electronically transferred records of the weights of Commercial MSW delivered by Contractor's Commercial MSW route collection vehicles' tipped weights at any Disposal Facilities used during that period. In addition, the Contractor will provide copies of the weight slips provided to the Contractor's Commercial MSW collection vehicles when they dispose of each load collected in the City of Seattle. The Contractor will arrange for electronic data transfer of records from 3rd & Lander Transfer Station, and will provide a complete copy set of the weight slips from all Disposal Facilities used to the City on a monthly basis, including information on date of disposal , time of disposal, and number assigned by the Contractor to the route. The City will likewise arrange for electronic data transfer to the Contractor of records of the Contractor's Commercial MSW disposal at the City's Disposal Facilities.

 1. Data from these sources will be compared to 1) the corresponding data for the two calendar years preceding the start of the Contract, and 2) the monthly submittals made by the operator of the 3rd & Lander Transfer Station during those two calendar years to the Seattle-King County Department of Public Health, which define all waste streams tipped at the 3rd & Lander Transfer Station, of Commercial MSW, excluding CDL, disposed of at that facility, for verification.

 d. Source of Contractor's Cubic Yards Collected Data. The source of data on total cubic yards of Commercial MSW collected in Seattle from April 1, 2001 through March 31, 2002 will be Commercial MSW billing data provided by the Contractor in monthly submittals to the City. Cubic yards included in the count will be subscribed cubic yards of container service to Can, Cart and Detachable accounts(adjusted for compaction ratios), collected by the Contractor's Commercial MSW collection route vehicles, plus billed cubic yards of Bulky Waste collected from those accounts. The City may survey a sample of customers, or conduct a spot-audit of Contractor routes, to verify customer service levels identified in the Contractor's billing data submittals.

 e. In the event of any apparent discrepancy, the City and the Contractor will review the records, and attempt to agree on a specific average weight per cubic yard estimate. If disagreement remains, the matter will be addressed pursuant to the provisions of Section 830.

 Section 407. Compensation Based on Average Weight Per Cubic Yard.

 a. Per unit payment amounts for Commercial MSW Container Collection shall be adjusted once following the first year of service under this Contract using the average weight per cubic yard defined by the procedures set forth in Section 404. The revised per unit payment structure for the remaining term of the Contract will then be calculated based on the baseline tariff rates in Attachment D, adjusted downward in three steps, to:

 1. exclude the portion of those tariffs associated with disposal costs;

 2. exclude the portion of those tariffs associated with taxes; and

 3. reduce the remaining net payments by 15% at each service level.

 b. These three adjustments will be calculated as follows:

 1. The adjustment for exclusion of disposal costs at each level of service will be made by i) multiplying the average weight per cubic yard established by the procedures set forth in Section 404(in tons) by the size of the container picked up (in cubic yards), by $77.87, and ii)subtracting that amount from the baseline tariff rate in Attachment D.

 2. The adjustment for exclusion of tax costs at each level of service will be made by i)multiplying the average weight per cubic yard established by the procedures set forth in Section 404 (in tons) by the size of the container picked up (in cubic yards), by $11.70, and ii) subtracting that amount from the baseline tariff rate in Attachment D subtracted from the original tariff.

 3. Finally the tariff rates at each collection service level that result from the two preceding adjustments will be multiplied by 85% to determine the revised initial year per unit payments for Commercial MSW Container Collection .

 Section 408. True-up Procedure for Recalculating First Year Compensation.

 a. When the revised initial year per unit payments for Commercial MSW Container Collection have been calculated pursuant to Section 407 for the period April 1, 2001 through March 31, 2002 the compensation from the City to the Contractor for the first twelve months of the Contract will be recalculated, based on the revised initial year per unit payments for Commercial MSW Container Collection.

 b. Any difference between the resulting recalculated compensation and the compensation actually made for Container Collection service in the first twelve months of the Contract will be applied to the twelve monthly payments to the Contractor from the City for the Contract period July 1, 2002 through June 30, 2003. If the adjustment is in the Contractor's favor, one-twelfth of the difference will be added to the City's compensation payment each month; if the adjustment is in the City's favor, one-twelfth of the difference will be subtracted from the City's compensation payment each month.

 Section 410. Compensation for Drop Box/Roll-off Collection (MSW or CDL).

 a. The City will compensate the Contractor on a monthly basis for Drop Box service at the per unit payment rates shown in Attachment F. The per unit payments defined in that attachment shall be multiplied by the number of Drop Box collection services performed by the Contractor during the preceding moth, to derive the monthly compensation for Drop Box services.

 b. Each of these per unit payments for Drop Box service shall be adjusted annually during the term of this Contract in accordance with the provisions of Section 470.

 Section 415. Compensation for Street-Side Litter Can Collection.

 a. If the City exercises its option to add street side litter collection to the services covered under this Contract, pursuant to Section 122, it will pay the Contractor:

 1. $1.50 per pickup for all containers, whether employing replaceable bags or internal cans, and whether the replaceable bags or internal cans are removable through the top or through a side panel.

 2. If the City requires the Contractor to perform litter can collection on Saturday or Sunday, the City shall pay the Contractor twice the payment amount established in this Section for each container collected.

 b. The per-container payment for litter can collection in the initial year of the City's exercise of its option will be adjusted annually from the amount set forth in subsection (a) above by multiplying the per container payment by 100% of the change in the CPI-W from December 31, 2000 until the initiation of such service. Thereafter, the per container payment for litter can collection will be adjusted annually each year during the term of this Contract according to the CPI adjustment clause set forth in Section 470 of this Contract.

 c. Any MSW collected by the Contractor from street-side litter cans will be included in the MSW tonnage upon which the percentage of tonnage guarantees are calculated, under the provisions of Section 130.

 d. If the City exercises its option to add litter can collection to the services covered under this Contract, compensation for such collection will be made on the same monthly schedule as compensation for other collection services covered under this Contract.

 Section 420. Can, Cart and Detachable Container Rentals.

 The City will compensate the Contractor for temporary and permanent Can, Cart and Detachable Container rentals at the daily and monthly per container payment rates shown in Attachment D, as adjusted annually according to the provisions of Section 470.

 Section 422. Drop Box Rentals.

 The City will compensate the Contractor for temporary and permanent Drop Box rentals at the daily and monthly per container payment rates shown in Attachment F, as adjusted annually according to the provisions of Section 470.

 Section 430. Compensation for Collection in Secondary Collection Area.

 a. The Contractor will receive base payments for Commercial MSW collection service to customers in its Secondary Collection Area according to the compensation structure in Sections 400 through 422, and an additional amount for customers in its Secondary Collection Area depending on their location as set forth below.

 b. For those Commercial MSW Container Collection service customers located north of the Ship Canal collected during the day (7 AM to 5 PM), the Contractor will be paid an additional amount equal to i)50% of the difference between the City's Secondary Collection Area Rates and the City's Primary Area Collection Rates for any given service level, plus ii)$5 per stop per day, up to a maximum of $20 per collection day.

 c. For those Commercial MSW Container Collection service customers located north of the Ship Canal collected at night (5 PM to 7 AM), the Contractor will be paid an additional amount equal to i)50% of the difference between the City's Secondary Collection Area Rates and the City's Primary Area Collection Rates for any given service level, plus ii)$15 per stop per day, up to a maximum of $60 per collection day.

 d. For those Commercial MSW Container Collection service customers located more than 1/2 mile from the service boundary and south of the Ship Canal the Contractor collected at any time will be paid an additional amount equal to i)75% of the difference between the City's Secondary Collection Area Rates and the City's Primary Area Collection Rates for any given service level plus ii)$15 per stop per day, up to a maximum of $60 per collection day.

 e. The Contractor must provide the City with billing statements that include service addresses and phone numbers for all Commercial MSW Secondary Collection Area customers as the basis for payment for service delivered in its Secondary Collection Area.

 f. In addition, the Contractor must notify the City within 24 hours of any existing Commercial MSW customers in its Primary Collection Area who have requested service by the other Commercial MSW collection contractor, and of any Commercial MSW customers in its Secondary Collection Area who have requested service by the Contractor.

 Section 435. Compensation Adjustment for Primary/Secondary Rate Differentials.

 a. The City reserves the right to establish Rates that will apply to customers receiving Commercial MSW service from other than their Primary Collection Area provider.

 b. For Commercial MSW service to customers in its Secondary Collection Area whose Rates for service are 15% or more higher than for the same service level in the Primary Collection Area, the Contractor will receive no additional compensation, beyond that established by the procedures in Section 430.

 c. For Commercial MSW service to customers in its Secondary Collection Area whose Rates for service are less than 15% higher than for the same service level in the Primary Collection Area, the City will compensate the Contractor by an additional amount equal to the number of percentage points by which the differential in rates is less than 15% higher multiplied by the Contractor's total compensation for service to customers receiving that level of service.

 d. Any such compensation will be calculated and paid monthly for the period for which the differential in Rates remains less than 15%, or prorated for partial months if necessary. If the Rates fall short of the 15% differential for more than one service category, the Contractor will be paid for each such service level category according to the formula set forth above.

 Section 440. Compensation Adjustment for Revised Average Round-trip Haul Times.

 a. The City reserves the right to direct the non-guaranteed portion of MSW collected by the Contractor described in Section 130(b) to any Disposal Facility of its choosing. For purposes of this section, it will be assumed that the City will initially direct all such non-guaranteed MSW to its South Recycling and Disposal Station (SRDS).

 b. After the Contractor has established its collection routes in its Primary Collection Area, an "initial average round-trip haul time" will be determined for transfer trips from the mid- points of those routes to the City's SRDS and back again. Average round-trip haul times will also be determined for transfer trips from the mid-points of those routes to each other Disposal Facility in the City

 c. The mechanism for determining the initial average round- trip haul times will be the City of Seattle GIS model developed for residential route haul time calculations, modified to incorporate the new route location information identified for the Commercial MSW collection routes.

 d. Whenever the City elects to direct portions of the waste collected under Section 130(b) of this Contract to Disposal Facilities other than SRDS, a "revised average round-trip haul time" will be calculated by using a weighted average of the shares of non-guaranteed tons directed to each Disposal Facility times the average round-trip haul times calculated for each Disposal Facility.

 e. Any resulting difference between the initial and revised average round-trip haul times will be the basis for Contractor compensation adjustments.

 f. Contractor compensation adjustments will be based on the following calculated cost impact formula:

 Calculated cost impact payment

 = $60.00 per hour

 *(revised average round-trip haul time), in hours

 *total transfer round trips per month

 * percentage of Contractor's Commercial MSW tonnage redirected

 [The rate per hour will be adjusted annually by the CPI factor defined in Section 470.]

 For increases in average round-trip haul time, the Contractor will receive 100% of the calculated cost impact as a compensation adjustment to be made on that month's compensation from the City. For decreases in average round- trip haul time, the City will receive 75% of the calculated cost impact (in the form of reduced payments to the Contractor), and the Contractor will retain any remaining cost savings.

 An example calculation of this cost impact formula is provided in Attachment G.

 g. The City will only direct trucks to Disposal Facilities that are open at the time the truck is full.

 Section 445. Compensation for Excess Cycle Time.

 The Contractor will be compensated an additional amount for each Cycle Time for MSW collected under this Contract at a Public Facility or Private Facility not owned by Contractor that is greater than 15 minutes. Compensation adjustments for excess Cycle Time will be calculated monthly. The additional amount that the Contractor will be compensated for excess Cycle Time will be determined based on Contractor's submittal of all relevant scale transaction receipts for the month in question.

 Compensation for excess Cycle Time =

 $60.00 per hour

 * the sum of total hours in excess of allowable Cycle Time.

 Section 450. Mechanism for Establishing Base Compensation for New Service Levels or Types of Service.

 a. The City retains the discretion to establish new service levels (e.g., 3/4 yard dumpster) or types of service at any time during the Contract. Compensation for any new service level or type of service will be based on the following:

 1. For a new service level (e.g., 3/4 yard dumpster), compensation to the Contractor shall be at the next highest level of service already established (e.g., 1 yard dumpster).

 2. For a different type of service (e.g., shared 4 yard Container Collection service at the end of an alley for multiple Commercial MSW customers)the per-unit payment shall be at the same amount as the most comparable existing service (e.g.,Attachment D, 4yd noncompacted service).

 b. If the City establishes new commercial recycling services for which the Contractor (1) has no contract service relationship with the City for such commercial recycling service and (2) which results in greater than 10% reduction in annual solid waste tonnage over the pre-program period, the Contractor may invoke the procedures set forth in Section 830, provided, however, that the City may in such case terminate the Contract with 18 month's notice rather than the 3 year's notice otherwise provided in Section 830.

 Section 470. Annual CPI Compensation Adjustment.

 a. A CPI adjustment factor will be applied to the per unit payments for Container Collection and Drop Box services; to all A&E Services, rental and maintenance fees, all hourly rates; and to any other rate that is fixed at the beginning of the Contract, unless otherwise specified.

 b. The CPI adjustment will be made annually effective April 1 of each year, with the first adjustment effective April 1, 2002. The annual adjustments will be based on a percentage of the change in the Seattle-Area CPI-W during the preceding calendar year in an amount determined by the formula below:

 1. For each subsequent adjustment, that percentage of the change in the CPI-W will be equal to the lesser of:

 a. 55% plus four times the absolute value of the percentage change in the CPI-W over the preceding calendar year, or

 b. 90%.

 Section 480. Compensation for Transition Services.

 The City will pay the Contractor $450,000, payable in two installments of $250,000 on April 9, 2001 and $200,000 October 8, 2001, to compensate the Contractor for costs associated with the transition from WUTC regulation to City contract. These payments will constitute the entire compensation for costs incurred by the Contractor for transitional activities, including, but not limited to, the costs of exchanging containers with the other Commercial MSW collection contractor, changes to the Contractor's billing systems, and collection route redesign.

 Section 490. Compensation for MSW Transfer and Short Haul.

 a. For transfer and short-haul of the guaranteed tonnage described in Section 130 to the long-haul transfer and disposal loading point designated by the City, the City will compensate the Contractor according to the payment schedule defined in Attachment J, Section A: "Guaranteed Share of Tonnage."

 b. For transfer and short-haul by the Contractor of any additional commercial MSW tonnage described in Section 130 to the long-haul transfer and disposal loading point designated by the City, the City will compensate the Contractor according to the payment schedule defined in Attachment J, Section B: "Additional Tonnage."

 c. The per-ton payments for tonnage transferred at the Contractor's 3rd & Lander Transfer Station will be adjusted annually according to the CPI adjustment terms defined in Attachment J.

 d. The City's payments to the Contractor for transfer and short haul defined in this section will be made on a monthly basis.

 e. The Contractor shall maintain the following data and transmit it to the City as back-up for transfer payments:

 1. Date of transfer service;

 2. Truck type and truck number delivering each load;

 3. Route identification for the truck's regularly assigned route;

 4. Disposal Facility location;

 5. Inbound time and weight;

 6. Outbound time and weight; and

 7. Any additional information as may be reasonably necessary to track transfer delivery, tonnage and costs.

 Section 495. Payment Mechanism.

 a. No later than the 5th of each month, the Contractor will submit an invoice to the City, for services provided during the prior month. This invoice will be paid by the City to the Contractor by wire transfer on or before the 25th of the same month (or 20 days after the invoice date, if the invoice is presented late). This invoice will be at a level of detail that will allow the City to determine the type (i.e., MSW or CDL), container size, frequency and per unit compensation associated with each service.

 b. Compensation paid by the City to the Contractor for services under this Contract, plus CDL disposal fees and direct taxes on those fees, will determine the taxable income under this Contract for which Contractor will be responsible for paying B&O taxes. Other than revenues from disposal fees passed through to Commercial Waste customers directly by the Contractor for CDL services, it is the intent of both the City and the Contractor that Contractor's taxable income for services under this Contract is not based upon the remittances paid by the Commercial Waste customers to the Contractor acting as collecting agent for the City, including those taxes described in Section 520. The Contractor and the City will renegotiate the terms of the Contract pursuant to Section 830 to comport with the intent of this provision, should the allocation of tax responsibility change as a result of change of law, should the Department of Revenue take a position inconsistent with the intent of this provision regarding Contractor's obligations to pay B&O taxes, or should any other taxing authority take a position contrary to this provision.

 F. CUSTOMER SERVICE, BILLING, CASH TRANSFERS

 Section 500. Customer Services.

 In addition to other customer service provisions in the this Contract, the Contractor shall provide the following services to Commercial Waste customers:

 a. Set up of new accounts for each commercial customer to be serviced by the Contractor in the Contractor's Primary Collection Area.

 E. COMPENSATION TO CONTRACTOR

 Section 400. Compensation for MSW Container Collection.

 a. Unless otherwise stated in the Contract, the City will compensate the Contractor on a monthly basis for collection from all Commercial customers receiving MSW Container Collection service, based on a per unit schedule defining the payment per collection pickup for each level of service. The per unit payments defined by that schedule will be multiplied by the number of collections of each service level performed by the Contractor during the preceding month, to derive the monthly compensation for Commercial MSW Container Collection.

 b. The initial per unit payment schedule for Container Collection in the first Contract year is shown in Attachment D.

 c. The per unit payment schedule in Attachment D reflects an estimated average weight per cubic yard of 155 pounds for the Contractor's MSW Container Collection customers.

 d. A revised per unit payment schedule for Container Collection will be established after the first contract year and will become the basis for subsequent monthly compensation calculations and for establishing the amount of any true-up adjustments as provided for in Section 408.

 e. The format for Contractor reporting of monthly collection service levels, and overall billing procedures are set forth in Sections 500 through 540.

 Section 403. Compensation for A&E Services.

 a. The City will compensate the Contractor on a monthly basis for A&E Services based on the per unit payment and the types of A&E services listed in Attachment E. The per unit payment defined by that schedule will be multiplied by the number of A&E Services performed by the Contractor during the preceding month, to derive the montly compensation for A&E Services.

 b. The Contractor will be compensated only for those A&E Services set forth in Attachment E. In setting Rates, however, the City may establish charges to customers for A&E Services which are not set forth in Attachment E, and for which the Contractor would receive no additional compensation.

 c. The format for Contractor reporting of monthly A&E Services, and overall billing procedures are defined in Section 500 through 540.

 d. For the first Contract year, per unit payments for A&E Services will be at the levels listed in Attachment E.

 e. Payment for A&E Services shall be adjusted annually each year of the Contract in accordance with the procedures set forth in Section 470.

 Section 404. Procedure for Establishing Average Weight Per Cubic Yard.

 a. The per unit payments in Attachment D are based on an estimated average weight of 155 pounds per cubic yard for Contractor's Commercial MSW Container Collection customers. The actual average weight per cubic yard will be established based on City-wide data from the first Contract year in accordance with the procedures set forth in this Section, and then will become the basis for adjustments under Section 407 for the remaining term of the Contract.

 b. Average Weight Per Cubic Yard. The average weight per cubic yard will be derived from City-wide data on:

 1. Commercial MSW tonnage collected by the Contractor and the City's other Commercial MSW collection contractor in the City of Seattle from Can Cart and Detachable Container customers from April 1, 2001 through March 31, 2002, and

 2. Cubic yards of subscribed Commercial MSW service and billed Bulky Waste collected by the Contractor and the City's other Commercial MSW collection contractor from Can, Cart and Detachable Container Commercial Waste customers in Seattle from April 1, 2001 through March 31, 2002.

 c. Source of Contractor's MSW Tonnage Data. The source of data on Commercial MSW tonnage collected by the Contractor in Seattle from April 1, 2001 through March 31, 2002 will be electronically transferred records of the weights of Commercial MSW delivered by Contractor's Commercial MSW route collection vehicles' tipped weights at any Disposal Facilities used during that period. In addition, the Contractor will provide copies of the weight slips provided to the Contractor's Commercial MSW collection vehicles when they dispose of each load collected in the City of Seattle. The Contractor will arrange for electronic data transfer of records from Eastmont Transfer Station, and will provide a complete copy set of the weight slips from all Disposal Facilities used to the City on a monthly basis, including information on date of disposal , time of disposal, and number assigned by the Contractor to the route. The City will likewise arrange for electronic data transfer to the Contractor of records of the Contractor's Commercial MSW disposal at the City's Disposal Facilities.

 1. Data from these sources will be compared to 1) the corresponding data for the two calendar years preceding the start of the Contract, and 2) the monthly submittals made by the operator of the Eastmont Transfer Station during those two calendar years to the Seattle-King County Department of Public Health, which define all waste streams tipped at the Eastmont Transfer Station, of Commercial MSW, excluding CDL, disposed of at that facility, for verification.

 d. Source of Contractor's Cubic Yards Collected Data. The source of data on total cubic yards of Commercial MSW collected in Seattle from April 1, 2001 through March 31, 2002 will be Commercial MSW billing data provided by the Contractor in monthly submittals to the City. Cubic yards included in the count will be subscribed cubic yards of container service to Can, Cart and Detachable accounts(adjusted for compaction ratios), collected by the Contractor's Commercial MSW collection route vehicles, plus billed cubic yards of Bulky Waste collected from those accounts. The City may survey a sample of customers, or conduct a spot-audit of Contractor routes, to verify customer service levels identified in the Contractor's billing data submittals.

 e. In the event of any apparent discrepancy, the City and the Contractor will review the records, and attempt to agree on a specific average weight per cubic yard estimate. If disagreement remains, the matter will be addressed pursuant to the provisions of Section 830.

 Section 407. Compensation Based on Average Weight Per Cubic Yard.

 a. Per unit payment amounts for Commercial MSW Container Collection shall be adjusted once following the first year of service under this Contract using the average weight per cubic yard defined by the procedures set forth in Section 404. The revised per unit payment structure for the remaining term of the Contract will then be calculated based on the baseline tariff rates in Attachment D, adjusted downward in three steps, to:

 1. exclude the portion of those tariffs associated with disposal costs;

 2. exclude the portion of those tariffs associated with taxes; and

 3. reduce the remaining net payments by 15% at each service level.

 b. These three adjustments will be calculated as follows:

 1. The adjustment for exclusion of disposal costs at each level of service will be made by i) multiplying the average weight per cubic yard established by the procedures set forth in Section 404(in tons) by the size of the container picked up (in cubic yards), by $77.87, and ii)subtracting that amount from the baseline tariff rate in Attachment D.

 2. The adjustment for exclusion of tax costs at each level of service will be made by i)multiplying the average weight per cubic yard established by the procedures set forth in Section 404 (in tons) by the size of the container picked up (in cubic yards), by $11.70, and ii) subtracting that amount from the baseline tariff rate in Attachment D subtracted from the original tariff.

 3. Finally the tariff rates at each collection service level that result from the two preceding adjustments will be multiplied by 85% to determine the revised initial year per unit payments for Commercial MSW Container Collection .

 Section 408. True-up Procedure for Recalculating First Year Compensation.

 a. When the revised initial year per unit payments for Commercial MSW Container Collection have been calculated pursuant to Section 407 for the period April 1, 2001 through March 31, 2002 the compensation from the City to the Contractor for the first twelve months of the Contract will be recalculated, based on the revised initial year per unit payments for Commercial MSW Container Collection..

 b. Any difference between the resulting recalculated compensation and the compensation actually made for Container Collection service in the first twelve months of the Contract will be applied to the twelve monthly payments to the Contractor from the City for the Contract period July 1, 2002 through June 30, 2003. If the adjustment is in the Contractor's favor, one-twelfth of the difference will be added to the City's compensation payment each month; if the adjustment is in the City's favor, one-twelfth of the difference will be subtracted from the City's compensation payment each month.

 Section 410. Compensation for Drop Box/Roll-off Collection (MSW or CDL).

 a. The City will compensate the Contractor on a monthly basis for Drop Box service at the per unit payment rates shown in Attachment F. The per unit payments defined in that attachment shall be multiplied by the number of Drop Box collection services performed by the Contractor during the preceding moth, to derive the monthly compensation for Drop Box services.

 b. Each of these per unit payments for Drop Box service shall be adjusted annually during the term of this Contract in accordance with the provisions of Section 470.

 Section 415. Compensation for Street-Side Litter Can Collection.

 a. If the City exercises its option to add street side litter collection to the services covered under this Contract, pursuant to Section 122, it will pay the Contractor:

 1. $1.50 per pickup for all containers, whether employing replaceable bags or internal cans, and whether the replaceable bags or internal cans are removable through the top or through a side panel.

 2. If the City requires the Contractor to perform litter can collection on Saturday or Sunday, the City shall pay the Contractor twice the payment amount established in this Section for each container collected.

 b. The per-container payment for litter can collection in the initial year of the City's exercise of its option will be adjusted annually from the amount set forth in subsection (a) above by multiplying the per container payment by 100% of the change in the CPI-W from December 31, 2000 until the initiation of such service. Thereafter, the per container payment for litter can collection will be adjusted annually each year during the term of this Contract according to the CPI adjustment clause set forth in Section 470 of this Contract.

 c. Any MSW collected by the Contractor from street-side litter cans will be included in the MSW tonnage upon which the percentage of tonnage guarantees are calculated, under the provisions of Section 130.

 d. If the City exercises its option to add litter can collection to the services covered under this Contract, compensation for such collection will be made on the same monthly schedule as compensation for other collection services covered under this Contract.

 Section 420. Can, Cart and Detachable Container Rentals.

 The City will compensate the Contractor for temporary and permanent Can, Cart and Detachable Container rentals at the daily and monthly per container payment rates shown in Attachment D, as adjusted annually according to the provisions of Section 470.

 Section 422. Drop Box Rentals.

 The City will compensate the Contractor for temporary and permanent Drop Box rentals at the daily and monthly per container payment rates shown in Attachment F, as adjusted annually according to the provisions of Section 470.

 Section 430. Compensation for Collection in Secondary Collection Area.

 a. The Contractor will receive base payments for Commercial MSW collection service to customers in its Secondary Collection Area according to the compensation structure in Sections 400 through 422, and an additional amount for customers in its Secondary Collection Area depending on their location as set forth below.

 b. For those Commercial MSW Container Collection service customers located north of the Ship Canal collected during the day (7 AM to 5 PM), the Contractor will be paid an additional amount equal to i)50% of the difference between the City's Secondary Collection Area Rates and the City's Primary Area Collection Rates for any given service level, plus ii)$5 per stop per day, up to a maximum of $20 per collection day.

 c. For those Commercial MSW Container Collection service customers located north of the Ship Canal collected at night (5 PM to 7 AM), the Contractor will be paid an additional amount equal to i)50% of the difference between the City's Secondary Collection Area Rates and the City's Primary Area Collection Rates for any given service level, plus ii)$15 per stop per day, up to a maximum of $60 per collection day.

 d. For those Commercial MSW Container Collection service customers located more than 1/2 mile from the service boundary and south of the Ship Canal the Contractor collected at any time will be paid an additional amount equal to i)75% of the difference between the City's Secondary Collection Area Rates and the City's Primary Area Collection Rates for any given service level plus ii)$15 per stop per day, up to a maximum of $60 per collection day.

 e. The Contractor must provide the City with billing statements that include service addresses and phone numbers for all Commercial MSW Secondary Collection Area customers as the basis for payment for service delivered in its Secondary Collection Area.

 f. In addition, the Contractor must notify the City within 24 hours of any existing Commercial MSW customers in its Primary Collection Area who have requested service by the other Commercial MSW collection contractor, and of any Commercial MSW customers in its Secondary Collection Area who have requested service by the Contractor.

 Section 435. Compensation Adjustment for Primary/Secondary Rate Differentials.

 a. The City reserves the right to establish Rates that will apply to customers receiving Commercial MSW service from other than their Primary Collection Area provider.

 b. For Commercial MSW service to customers in its Secondary Collection Area whose Rates for service are 15% or more higher than for the same service level in the Primary Collection Area, the Contractor will receive no additional compensation, beyond that established by the procedures in Section 430.

 c. For Commercial MSW service to customers in its Secondary Collection Area whose Rates for service are less than 15% higher than for the same service level in the Primary Collection Area, the City will compensate the Contractor by an additional amount equal to the number of percentage points by which the differential in rates is less than 15% higher multiplied by the Contractor's total compensation for service to customers receiving that level of service.

 d. Any such compensation will be calculated and paid monthly for the period for which the differential in Rates remains less than 15%, or prorated for partial months if necessary. If the Rates fall short of the 15% differential for more than one service category, the Contractor will be paid for each such service level category according to the formula set forth above.

 Section 440. Compensation Adjustment for Revised Average Round-trip Haul Times.

 a. The City reserves the right to direct the non-guaranteed portion of MSW collected by the Contractor described in Section 130(b) to any Disposal Facility of its choosing. For purposes of this section, it will be assumed that the City will initially direct all such non-guaranteed MSW to its South Recycling and Disposal Station (SRDS).

 b. After the Contractor has established its collection routes in its Primary Collection Area, an "initial average round-trip haul time" will be determined for transfer trips from the mid- points of those routes to the City's SRDS and back again. Average round-trip haul times will also be determined for transfer trips from the mid-points of those routes to each other Disposal Facility in the City

 c. The mechanism for determining the initial average round- trip haul times will be the City of Seattle GIS model developed for residential route haul time calculations, modified to incorporate the new route location information identified for the Commercial MSW collection routes.

 d. Whenever the City elects to direct portions of the waste collected under Section 130(b) of this Contract to Disposal Facilities other than SRDS, a "revised average round-trip haul time" will be calculated by using a weighted average of the shares of non-guaranteed tons directed to each Disposal Facility times the average round-trip haul times calculated for each Disposal Facility.

 e. Any resulting difference between the initial and revised average round-trip haul times will be the basis for Contractor compensation adjustments.

 f. Contractor compensation adjustments will be based on the following calculated cost impact formula:

 Calculated cost impact payment

 = $60.00 per hour

 *(revised average round-trip haul time), in hours

 *total transfer round trips per month

 * percentage of Contractor's Commercial MSW tonnage redirected

 [The rate per hour will be adjusted annually by the CPI factor defined in Section 470.]

 For increases in average round-trip haul time, the Contractor will receive 100% of the calculated cost impact as a compensation adjustment to be made on that month's compensation from the City. For decreases in average round- trip haul time, the City will receive 75% of the calculated cost impact (in the form of reduced payments to the Contractor), and the Contractor will retain any remaining cost savings.

 An example calculation of this cost impact formula is provided in Attachment G.

 g. The City will only direct trucks to Disposal Facilities that are open at the time the truck is full.

 Section 445. Compensation for Excess Cycle Time.

 The Contractor will be compensated an additional amount for each Cycle Time for MSW collected under this Contract at a Public Facility or Private Facility not owned by Contractor that is greater than 15 minutes. Compensation adjustments for excess Cycle Time will be calculated monthly. The additional amount that the Contractor will be compensated for excess Cycle Time will be determined based on Contractor's submittal of all relevant scale transaction receipts for the month in question.

 Compensation for excess Cycle Time =

 $60.00 per hour

 * the sum of total hours in excess of allowable Cycle Time.

 Section 450. Mechanism for Establishing Base Compensation for New Service Levels or Types of Service.

 a. The City retains the discretion to establish new service levels (e.g., 3/4 yard dumpster) or types of service at any time during the Contract. Compensation for any new service level or type of service will be based on the following:

 1. For a new service level (e.g., 3/4 yard dumpster), compensation to the Contractor shall be at the next highest level of service already established (e.g., 1 yard dumpster).

 2. For a different type of service (e.g., shared 4 yard Container Collection service at the end of an alley for multiple Commercial MSW customers)the per-unit payment shall be at the same amount as the most comparable existing service (e.g.,Attachment D, 4yd noncompacted service).

 b. If the City establishes new commercial recycling services for which the Contractor (1) has no contract service relationship with the City for such commercial recycling service and (2) which results in greater than 10% reduction in annual solid waste tonnage over the pre-program period, the Contractor may invoke the procedures set forth in Section 830, provided, however, that the City may in such case terminate the Contract with 18 month's notice rather than the 3 year's notice otherwise provided in Section 830.

 Section 495. Payment Mechanism.

 a. No later than the 5th of each month, the Contractor will submit an invoice to the City, for services provided during the prior month. This invoice will be paid by the City to the Contractor by wire transfer on or before the 25th of the same month (or 20 days after the invoice date, if the invoice is presented late).

 b. Compensation paid by the City to the Contractor for services under this Contract, plus CDL disposal fees and direct taxes on those fees, will determine the taxable income under this Contract for which Contractor will be responsible for paying B&O taxes.

The Contractor and the City will renegotiate the terms of the Contract pursuant to Section 830 to comport with the intent of this provision, should the allocation of tax responsibility change as a result of change of law, should the Department of Revenue take a position inconsistent with the intent of this provision regarding Contractor's obligations to pay B&O taxes, or should any other taxing authority take a position contrary to this provision.

 d. Treatment of Certain Taxes and Other Excises

 1. The Parties agree that Contractor will act as collecting agent for the City with regard to the following taxes and any other taxes imposed by law on the Commercial Waste customers for which the City has responsibility of remittance to the appropriate taxing authority, except for the portion of these taxes that are based either directly or indirectly on CDL disposal fees, which are passed though to the customers and collected and paid directly by the Contractor:
