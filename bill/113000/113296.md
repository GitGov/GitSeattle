 ORDINANCE ________________

 AN ORDINANCE relating to the impoundment of vehicles, amending Subsection F of Section 11.30.160 of the Seattle Municipal Code to provide counsel at public expense for eligible persons appealing impounds to Municipal Court under subsection 11.30.120 D 5

 WHEREAS in 1993 the State Legislature passed RCW 46.20.289 authorizing the suspension of licenses by the Department of Licensing in cases where the licensee has failed to respond to a notice of traffic infraction, failed to appear at a requested hearing, violated a written promise to appear in court, or has failed to comply with the terms of a notice of traffic infraction or citation, other than for a notice of violation of RCW 46.55.105 or a standing, stopping, or parking violation; and

 WHEREAS in 1998 the City Council passed Ordinance 119180 authorizing the impoundment of vehicles driven by drivers with a suspended or revoked driver's license; and

 WHEREAS by May 31, 2000 approximately 7,600 autos had been impounded under Operation Impound and 2,600 autos had been auctioned because of the owners' inability to pay for accumulated fines and fees; and

 WHEREAS the overwhelming majority of persons charged with driving while license suspended in the third degree are eligible for appointment of counsel at public expense under the standards of the King County Office of Public Defense and many persons whose driving results in vehicles being impounded are represented by appointed counsel in the misdemeanor cases resulting from the arrests made at the time of the impounds; and

 WHEREAS drivers of vehicles impounded due to driving while license suspended in the third degree who are eligible to receive counsel at public expense for the misdemeanor charge will no longer be able to avail themselves of this counsel under the City Attorney's policy of dismissing the majority of criminal charges of DWLS in the third degree in conjunction with impoundment; and

 WHEREAS the City Attorney's use of impoundment as a substitute for criminal prosecution is evidence that impoundment is a roughly equal sanction to criminal prosecution and a person receiving that sanction should be entitled to legal representation in an appeal of that sanction if they are eligible for counsel at public expense under the income eligibility standards of the King County Office of Public Defense or its functional successor as the City's agent in arranging appointed counsel; and

 WHEREAS the City of Seattle is represented by legal counsel in appeals to Municipal Court under subsection 11.30.120 D 5; and

 WHEREAS vehicle impoundment under Section 11.30.105 is the only civil sanction imposed by the Seattle Municipal Code for which a criminal arrest for an alleged violation of the criminal code is a precondition; and

 WHEREAS the risk of punishing innocent people is unacceptably high if vehicle impoundment is triggered by a police officer's interpretation of Department of Licensing records and there is no meaningful check on that judgment because owners and drivers are unable to effectively challenge the decision to impound without access to counsel; and

 WHEREAS, when drivers are criminally prosecuted for Driving While License Suspended, charges are dismissed against a substantial number of defendants at trial because evidence was obtained as a result of an unlawful traffic stop; and

 WHEREAS, when drivers are criminally prosecuted for Driving While License Suspended, a substantial number of defendants are acquitted because the Department of Licensing did not comply with due process requirements in notifying the driver of the intended suspension and/or in providing a fair opportunity for a hearing on the merits of the suspension prior to its effective date; and

 WHEREAS, when drivers are criminally prosecuted for Driving While License Suspended, it is common for the City Attorney to dismiss or amend the charge to a lesser infraction upon a showing that the driver's license was wrongly suspended due to an error by the Department of Licensing or a court of limited jurisdiction; and

 WHEREAS, without counsel, during the period from January 1999 through June 2000, at most 25 out of

 7,500 persons challenged the impoundment of their vehicles in de novo hearings in Seattle Municipal Court, while during that same period, with counsel, the lawfulness of traffic stops and the validity of license suspensions were contested in hundreds of criminal Driving While License Suspended cases; and

 WHEREAS no factor adequately explains the small number of persons availing themselves of the de novo hearing process to challenge vehicle impoundments aside from the inability of persons affected to understand their right to appeal and/or to afford counsel; and

 WHEREAS the Council desires that no person be wrongfully or unlawfully deprived of their vehicle under Seattle Municipal Code 11.30.105 and left without redress or compensation because they are unable to afford counsel; and

 BE IT ORDAINED BY THE CITY OF SEATTLE AS FOLLOWS:

 Section 1. Subsection F of section 11.30.160 of the Seattle Municipal Code (Ordinance 108200 2 (11.30.160), as last amended by Ordinance 12000 is further amended as follows:

 11.30.160 Post-impoundment hearing procedure.

 Hearings requested pursuant to Section 11.30.120 shall be held by a Municipal Court judicial officer who shall determine whether the impoundment was proper and whether the associated removal, towing, storage, and administrative fees were proper. The Municipal Court judicial officer shall not have the authority to determine the commission or mitigation of any parking infraction unless a timely response under Section 11.31.050 A was filed to that notice of infraction requesting a hearing and the hearing date for that infraction has not passed, in which case the Municipal Court judicial officer has discretion to consolidate the impoundment hearing and the notice of infraction hearing.

 F. An appeal of the Municipal Court judicial officer's decision in Municipal Court shall be conducted according to, and is subject to, the procedures of this section. If the person appealing to Municipal Court under subsection 11.30.120 D 5 is financially unable to obtain representation by legal counsel for that appeal and that person is eligible for appointment of counsel at public expense under the income eligibility standards of the King County Office of Public Defense or its functional successor as the City's agent in arranging appointed counsel for misdemeanor defendants, then at the request of that person he or she shall be provided counsel for that appeal at City expense.  If the court finds that the impoundment or the removal, towing, storage, or administrative fees are improper, any judgment entered against the City shall include the amount of the filing fee.

 Section 2. This ordinance shall take effect 30 days after the Municipal Court Administrator certifies in writing to the City Council President that suitable arrangements are in place for providing appointed counsel, but in no event later than December 31, 2000.
