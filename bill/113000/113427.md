 ORDINANCE _____________

 AN ORDINANCE relating to the Human Services Department; authorizing the execution of agreements with the Workforce Development Council and United Way of King County for financial assistance for the operation of the Seattle Youth Employment Program; increasing the expenditure allowance in the 2000 budget of the Human Services Department by making reimbursable appropriations; creating certain positions; and ratifying and confirming prior acts; all by a three- fourths vote of the City Council.

 WHEREAS, many low-income and otherwise disadvantaged youth are in need of job readiness training, skill building, esteem building, leadership development and other services to help prepare them for employment and self-sufficiency; and

 WHEREAS, many such youth are in need of employment during the summer months when school is not in session; and

 WHEREAS, the City of Seattle Human Services Department operates the Seattle Youth Employment Program, providing summer as well as year- round employment opportunities and a wide range of training, support and counseling for low-income youth ages 14-21; and

 WHEREAS, the City of Seattle Human Services Department has operated a youth employment program since the early 1970's, such program being funded largely by federal Department of Labor funds, most recently flowing through the Seattle-King County Private Industry Council; and

 WHEREAS, United Way of King County historically has also provided support to the City's youth employment program; and

 WHEREAS, the new federal Workforce Investment Act ("the Act") has dramatically altered the policies and priorities of youth employment and training programs to emphasize year round services and a new local entity, the Seattle-King County Workforce Development Council, replacing Seattle-King County Private Industry Council, has been created to administer funds under the Act; and

 WHEREAS, the new priorities of the Act and decreased federal appropriations have greatly reduced federal funding available for subsidized summer youth employment; and

 WHEREAS, funding under the Workforce Investment Act is available for youth employment readiness and other services to the City of Seattle Human Services Department through the Seattle-King County Workforce Development Council; and

 WHEREAS, to help mitigate the reduction in federal funding for summer youth employment and to assist in the provision of year round employment readiness services for youth, United Way of King County has significantly increased its support available to the Human Services Department; Now, Therefore,

 BE IT ORDAINED BY THE CITY OF SEATTLE AS FOLLOWS:
