 AN ORDINANCE relating to land use and zoning, amending Ordinance 119586 to extend a moratorium on the acceptance of applications for use permits or construction permits for new single-family dwellings over water within the Urban Stable and Conservancy Recreation shoreline environments.

 BE IT ORDAINED BY THE CITY OF SEATTLE AS FOLLOWS:

 Section 1. The City Council hereby makes the following legislative findings of fact and declarations:

 1. Ordinance 119586 provided a temporary moratorium on permits for new single-family dwellings over water within the Urban Stable and Conservancy Recreation shoreline environments, pending analysis and a decision by the City Council whether such uses should be permitted.

 2. The City Council has completed its analysis and determined that such uses should not be permitted. Accordingly SMC 23.60.604 (Urban Stable environment) and SMC 23.60.365 (Conservancy Recreation envrionment) should be amended to prohibit the construction of new single-family dwellings over water within those environments.

 3. The amendment of SMC 23.60.604 and SMC 23.60.365 will not become effective before the expiration of the moratorium on January 1, 2000, thereby necessitating the extension of the moratorium.

 Section 2. Section 2 of Ordinance 119586 is hereby amended to read as follows:

 Until January July 1, 2000, no use permit application or construction permit application may be accepted, or use permit issued, for any single-family residence proposed to be located in or over water pursuant to SMC 23.60.365 or SMC 23.60.604.

 Section 3. This ordinance shall take effect and be in force thirty (30) days from and after its approval by the Mayor, but if not approved and returned by the Mayor within ten (10) days after presentation, it shall take effect as provided by Municipal Code Section 1.04.020.
