 (hereafter, the "Property") for the sum of ONE HUNDRED SIXTY THOUSAND FOUR HUNDRED FIFTY AND NO/100 DOLLARS ($160,450.00), which is the price determined by the State of Washington pursuant to the Phase II Agreement; PROVIDED, that payment

 of such. amount shall be made solely from money deposited in escrow by the Purchaser described in Section 2 below, and that the acquisition by the City shall not occur until all conditions have been met for contemporaneous transfer of the Property to the Purchaser as set forth in Section 2 below.
