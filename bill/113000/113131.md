The funds, when received, are hereby accepted, and shall be deposited to the credit of the Supplemental Appropriations Account of Emergency Subfund to reimburse for the appropriation made in Section 2.

 Section 2. To carry out the purpose of the grant agreement authorized in Section 1, and contingent upon the execution of that agreement, the following program categories in the 2000 budget of the Strategic Planning Office are increased as follows:
