 3.70.010 Commission established -- Purpose.

 There is hereby established a Seattle Ethics and Elections Commission to administer the City's Code of Ethics (Chapter 4.16); to administer the Election Campaign Code and its campaign matching fund program (Chapter 2.04); to publish the City's election pamphlets (Chapter 2.14); ~~to administer the political sign ordinance (Chapter 2.24);~~to investigate, make determinations, and make recommendations to the Mayor, City Council, or contracting department, as appropriate, regarding alleged violations of the conflict of interest provisions in contracts entered into with targeted partners as defined in City Council Resolution 30072; and to investigate certain complaints of improper governmental action under the whistleblower protection ordinance (Sections 4.20.800 through 4.20.860).

 Section 3. Section 3.70.100 of the Seattle Municipal Code is amended by adding a new subsection as follows:

 3.70.100 Powers and duties.

 The Commission shall have the following powers:

 J. To receive complaints and inquiries, and to investigate, hold (or delegate the authority to hold) hearings, make determinations, and make recommendations to the Mayor, City Council, or contracting department, as appropriate, regarding alleged violations of the conflict of interest provisions in contracts entered into with targeted partners as defined in City Council Resolution 30072.

 1. All suspected violations (hereafter referenced as "complaint") may be reported to the Executive Director for investigation.

 2. Within thirty (30) days after receipt of a complaint, the Executive Director shall conduct a preliminary investigation to determine whether the complaint, on its face, alleges facts that, if true, would constitute a violation of the conflict of interest provisions of a contract between the City and targeted partners, their contractors or subcontractors. At the request of the Executive Director, the Commission may, for good cause shown, extend the time for completion of the preliminary investigation. If the Commission determines that the preliminary investigation must be completed in less than thirty (30) days in order to avoid prejudice or irreparable harm to the person alleged to have violated the conflict of interest provisions, the Commission shall order the Executive Director to complete the preliminary investigation in a shorter period of time.

 3. If the Executive Director determines, after investigation, that there are no reasonable grounds to believe that a violation has occurred, or determines that the violation was inadvertent and minor, the Executive Director shall recommend to the City's contracting authority that it dismiss the complaint. If the City's contracting authority does so dismiss the complaint, the Executive Director shall issue a notice of dismissal that sets forth the facts and the provisions of law upon which the dismissal is based, and shall provide a copy of the written dismissal to the complainant, to the alleged violator, to the City's contracting authority, and to the Commission. The complainant may appeal the contracting authority's dismissal decision to the Commission under the Rules of the Commission.

 4. If, after investigation, the Executive Director has reason to believe that a material violation of the conflict of interest provisions has occurred, the Executive Director shall initiate an enforcement proceeding by issuing to the alleged violator a charging document which includes the conflict of interest provision allegedly violated and the conduct that constitutes the alleged violation(s), and shall also issue a copy of the charging document to the Commission and to the City's contracting authority and schedule a hearing before the Commission.

 5. The Commission shall commence a hearing within thirty (30) days from the date that the Executive Director schedules the hearing, or, within that time, delegate the fact finding to the Office of Hearing Examiner. The alleged violator may be represented by legal counsel at its own expense at all proceedings under this section. The Commission shall issue a written determination stating whether it believes that the conflict of interest provisions have been violated and setting forth the facts and the provisions of law upon which this determination is based. A copy of said determination shall be delivered to the complainant, to the alleged violator charged with the violation, and to the City's contracting authority.

 6. All hearings hereunder shall be conducted as "contested case" hearings under the Administrative Code, Seattle Municipal Code Chapter 3.02 and the Commission's rules and regulations. The Commission may delegate the fact-finding to the Office of Hearing Examiner and may review and revise the recommended decision of the Hearing Examiner.

 7. If the Commission determines that a contractor has violated the conflict of interest provisions, the Commission may take one or more of the following actions: a. Recommend that the City's contracting authority impose a monetary fine upon the violating contractor according to the schedule set forth in the relevant contract;

 b. Recommend that the City's contracting authority suspend the contract;

 c. Recommend that the City's contracting authority direct the prime contractor to remove the offending subcontractor from the project;

 d. Recommend that the City's contracting authority rescind, void, or terminate the contract;

 e. Recommend that the City bar the contractor from further contracting with the City for a period of time;

 f. Recommend that the City's contracting authority impose any other reasonable penalty available under applicable law.

 Section 4. This ordinance shall take effect and be in force thirty (30) days from and after its approval by the Mayor, but if not approved and returned by the Mayor within ten (10) days after presentation, it shall take effect as provided by Municipal Code Section 1.04.020.
