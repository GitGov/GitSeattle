 PROPERTY USE AND DEVELOPMENT AGREEMENT

 This agreement is executed this date in favor of the City of Seattle, a Municipal Corporation (herein called "City"), by Jorve Family LLC, owner of property legally described herein (herein called "Owner"). RECITALS 1. Seattle Municipal Code ("SMC") 23.34.004 authorizes the Seattle City Council to approve contract rezones in which a landowner agrees to self-imposed restrictions upon the use and development of property as a condition of rezone approval.

 2. The Owner has a fee simple or other beneficial interest in property identified in paragraph three and wants the City Council to rezone the property pursuant to SMC23.34.004.

 3. The property that is subject to this agreement ("Property") is: Lots 7 and 8, Block 1, Morgan Terrace, as per plat recorded in volume 23 of Plats, page 27, Records of King County Washington; except portion of said Lot 8 conveyed to the City of Seattle by deed recorded under Recording Number 4559991; and except portion of said Lot 8 conveyed to the City of Seattle by deed recorded under Recording Number 9803040353; and except portion of said Lot 8 lying north of the alley.

 Section 1. Pursuant to SMC 23.34.004, Owner hereby covenants, bargains and agrees, on behalf of itself and its successors and assigns, that it will comply with the following limitations and conditions in consideration of the rezone of the Property from Lowrise 2 (L2) to Neighborhood Commercial 2 with a 30-foot height limit (NC2/30').

 A. Uses will be limited to the following uses: parking accessory to the Thriftway store or to other uses in the commercial node to relieve congestion; residential structures meeting the development standards of the Lowrise 2 zone; or commercial uses as limited in condition B below.

 B. Development of commercial use will be limited to uses and structures that the Department of Design, Construction and Land Use ("DCLU"), with the advice of other entities having jurisdiction, determines to meet all the following conditions:

 1. Commercial uses must be small, pedestrian serving uses;

 2. Any structure must create a famayade at the street front to add to the pedestrian-friendly atmosphere of the street;

 3. Any commercial use of the site must not create impacts not normally associated with residential development upon nearby development, including but not limited to noise and light impacts.

 4. Any structure containing commercial use must not exceed a base height of 25 feet;

 5. Any commercial use of the site must not substantially diminish parking capacity on the subject site.

 C. Landscaping, buffering, and screening are required to an extent determined by DCLU to create a pedestrian-friendly streetscape and to minimize impacts of parking and/or any other commercial use of the site on nearby residential uses. Any lighting on the site must be determined by DCLU to create a pedestrian-friendly streetscape and minimize intrusion on nearby residential uses.

 D No non-required parking use may be established on the subject site until the residential structure currently located on the site has been relocated to a site within Seattle City limits, and a final building inspection has led to its approval as a dwelling unit[TJ1].

 E. Hours of construction will be limited to the hours of 8:30 a.m. to 6 p.m. on non-holiday weekdays.

 Section 2. This Property Use and Development Agreement ("Agreement") shall be recorded in the records of King County by the City Clerk. The covenants hereof shall be deemed to attach to and run with the Property and shall be binding upon the Owner, its heirs, successors and assigns, and shall apply to after-acquired title of the Owner of the Property; provided the covenants herein and the rezone shall expire and be of no force and effect two years from the effective date of the approval of this rezone if Owner fails to satisfy the requirements of Section 23.76.060 of the Seattle Municipal Code.

 Section 3. This Agreement may be amended or modified by agreement between Owners and the City provided such amendment agreement shall be approved by the legislative authority of the City by ordinance. Nothing in this Agreement shall prevent the City Council from making such further amendments to the Land Use Code or exercising the City's police power, as it may deem necessary in the public interest. Owner agrees that nothing in this Agreement is intended to authorize any use or dimension not otherwise permitted in a Neighborhood Commercial 2 zone with a 30-foot height limit (NC2/30'). The conditions contained in this Agreement are based on the unique circumstances applicable to this Property, and this Agreement is not intended to establish precedent for other rezones in the surrounding area.

 Section 4. This Agreement is made for the benefit of the City and for the benefit of the owners of the property within 300 feet of the Property and either the City or any such property owners may institute and prosecute any proceeding at law or in equity to enforce this Agreement.

 Section 5. Owner acknowledges that compliance with the conditions of this Agreement is a condition of the subject rezone and that if Owner avails itself of the benefits of this rezone but then fails to comply with the conditions of this Agreement with the City, in addition to pursuing any other remedy, the City may revoke the rezone by ordinance and require the use of the Property to conform to the requirements of the Lowrise 2 (L2) zone.
