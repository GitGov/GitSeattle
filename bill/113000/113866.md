 AN ORDINANCE relating to the West Seattle Junction Parking and Business Improvement Area; clarifying the basis for the parking assessment rates; and amending Ordinance 119539 in connection therewith.

 WHEREAS, the West Seattle Junction Parking and Business Improvement Area (PBIA) was created by Ordinance 113326 in 1987 for the purpose of enabling businesses within the Area to enhance conditions for the continued operation of those businesses; and

 WHEREAS, the language in Ordinance 119539 describing the parking assessment rate structure can be clarified to more accurately describe and implement the intent of the petitioners who requested that the City create the PBIA; and
