 ORDINANCE __________________

 AN ORDINANCE relating to land use and zoning, amending Ordinance 119487, as previously amended, by extending the moratorium on signs displaying animation or rapidly changing images or messages until October 1, 2001.

 BE IT ORDAINED BY THE CITY OF SEATTLE AS FOLLOWS:

 Section 1. The City Council hereby makes the following legislative findings of fact:

 a) On June 1, 1999 the City Council passed, and on June 4, 1999 the Mayor signed, Ordinance 119487 establishing a moratorium governing signs displaying animation or rapidly changing images or messages. The moratorium was scheduled to expire on December 1, 1999. The moratorium has been extended by Ordinance 119697 and Ordinance 120113 and is now scheduled to expire on June 1, 2001.

 b) Within sixty (60) days after adoption of Ordinance 119487 the City Council held a public hearing on the ordinance pursuant to the requirements of RCW 36.70A.390.

 c) By Ordinance 119487 the City Council authorized the Department of Design, Construction and Land Use to prepare a work plan to study appropriate regulations.

 d) Signs with the capability of displaying messages in this manner have been constructed in the City of Seattle, in neighboring jurisdictions, and in the City of Portland, and are currently being considered for development by sign owners and potential sign owners in Seattle.

 e) Additional time is needed for continuing study of these sign display methods and to develop legislation based on the study. Extending the moratorium period will prevent construction of this type of sign in a manner that could be contrary to the findings of the study and the intent of the eventual legislation.

 f) The City Council believes that it will take approximately four (4) additional months for DCLU to complete its work and for the Council to prepare, have hearings on and adopt any amendments they may deem appropriate to regulate these display methods.

 g) Continuing a moratorium on the use of these methods for displaying messages on signs does not change the number of signs allowed in the city, nor does it restrict content on signs because messages can be displayed using all methods currently allowed by the Sign Code.

 h) A public hearing was held before Council on this proposed extension of the moratorium on signs displaying animation or rapidly changing images or messages on April 30, 2001.

 i) This Council therefore finds that the protection of the public health, safety, and welfare requires extending the moratorium on signs displaying animation or rapidly changing images or messages until completion of the work program and development of appropriate regulations, if any.

 Section 2. Section 2 of Ordinance 119487, as previously amended by Ordinance 119697, is hereby amended to read: Through ((December 1, 2000)) October 1, 2001, or until new land use regulations relating to the methods of display enumerated in Section 3 of Ordinance 119487 take effect, whichever is sooner, no permit shall be issued, nor shall any master use permit application or sign permit application be accepted, for the methods of display described in Section 3, nor shall the display of messages using the methods enumerated in Section Subsection 3 (a)A be lawful on any existing sign, unless allowed by s Section 3, subsection B or C of Ordinance 119487.

 Section 3. Section 6 of Ordinance 119487, as previously amended by Ordinance 119697 and Ordinance 120113, is hereby amended to read: This Ordinance expires ((June 1, 2001)) October 1, 2001.

 Section 4. Pursuant to SMC 25.05.880, the City Council finds that an exemption under SEPA for this action is necessary to prevent an imminent threat to public health and safety and to prevent an imminent threat of serious environmental degradation through continued development under the existing regulations. SEPA review of any permanent regulations proposed for replacement of the existing zoning shall be conducted.

 Section 5. The revised workplan attached as Attachment 1 to this ordinance is hereby approved and adopted.

 Section 6. This ordinance shall take effect and be in force thirty (30) days from and after its approval by the Mayor, but if not approved and returned by the Mayor within ten (10) days after presentation, it shall take effect as provided by Municipal Code Section 1.04.020.
