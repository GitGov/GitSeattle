 No person conducting or operating an All Ages Dance shall permit any person under the age of fourteen (14) years to enter or remain on the premises unless an adult accompanies that person.

 Section 4. Section 6.295.150 of the Seattle Municipal Code is amended as follows:

 6.295.150 Indemnification and Insurance Requirements.

A. The licensee shall indemnify and hold the City harmless from any and all losses, claims, actions or damages suffered by any person or persons by reason of or resulting from any negligence of the licensee or its agents, employees, or patrons or on account of any act or omission of the licensee in its exercise of its license or use or occupancy of any premises in connection with such license. In the event any suit or action is brought against the City, the licensee shall, upon notice of the commencement thereof, defend the same, at no cost and expense to the City, and promptly satisfy any final judgment adverse to the City or to the City and the licensee jointly; provided, that in the event the City determines that one (1) or more principles of governmental or public law are involved, the City retains the right to participate in such action. The above liability shall not be diminished by the fact, if it be a fact, that any such death, injury, damage, loss, cost or expense may have been, or may be alleged to have been, contributed to by the negligence of the City or its officers, employees or agents; provided, however, that nothing contained in this section shall be construed as requiring the licensee to indemnify the City against liability for damages arising out of bodily injury to persons or damage to property caused by or resulting from the sole negligence of the City, or its officers, employees or agents.

B. If the venue to be used for an All Ages Dance does not carry insurance that would meet the following standards, the licensee shall, at no expense to the City, secure and maintain during the full term of the license, general comprehensive liability insurance issued by one (1) or more companies authorized to do business in the State of Washington, which insurance shall be subject to the approval of the City Risk Manager as to company, form and coverage, and which insurance must fully protect the City from any and all claims and risks in connection with any activity under the license or use or occupancy of any Youth Dance Venue, and provide the following minimum coverage:

(1)One Million Dollars ($1,000,000) per person, per occurrence; and

(2)One Million Dollars ($1,000,000) annual aggregate.

Said policy must specifically name the City of Seattle as an additional insured party thereunder in the following manner:  The City of Seattle is an additional insured for all coverages provided by this policy of insurance and shall be fully and completely protected by this policy and for any claim, suit, injury, death, damage or loss of any sort sustained by a person, organization or corporation in connection with any activity under the license or use or occupancy of any Youth Dance Venue regulated by this section.

 The coverages provided by this policy to the City or any other named insured shall not be terminated, reduced, or otherwise changed in any respect without providing at least thirty (30) days prior written notice to the Risk Manager of the City of Seattle.

C.The licensee shall deliver to the Risk Manager of the City of Seattle a copy of all policies required under this provision and all endorsements thereto or other evidence to the reasonable satisfaction of the Risk Manager that the licensee has secured or renewed and is maintaining insurance as required by this section.

D.The "ACCORD" form of Certification of Insurance shall not be submitted as such evidence, and shall not be deemed to be satisfactory evidence unless the following changes are made on such form:  The wording on the top of the form:

 This certificate is issued as a matter of information only and confers no rights upon the certificate holder.

 shall be deleted in its entirety.

 The following wording:

 Should any of the above-described policies be canceled, reduced as to coverage, or otherwise changed before the expiration date thereof, the issuing company shall provide written notice of such action to the Risk Manager of the City of Seattle.

 Shall be added at the bottom of the form.

E.The procuring of the insurance required by this section shall not be construed to limit the licensee's liability thereunder.

F.The licensee shall provide for the prompt and efficient handling of all claims for injury, death, damage, or loss arising out of the acts or omissions of licensee. The licensee agrees that all such claims, whether processed by the licensee or its insurer, either indirectly or by means of an agent, will be handled by a person with a permanent office within the corporate limits of Seattle.

 Section 5. It is the express intent of the City Council that these amendments shall only take effect if 1) the City Council votes to override the veto of Council Bill 113302 or 2) The City Council enacts Council Bill _________.
