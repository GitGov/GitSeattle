 Legislation Title:

 AN ORDINANCE transferring additional funding to the Neighborhood Matching Fund Subfund.

 Summary of the Legislation:

 As per Resolution 30085, adopted by City Council in November 1999, this legislation will add $375,000 in one-time funding to the 2000 Neighborhood Matching Subfund from the Emergency Subfund. The Emergency Subfund will be reimbursed from excess General Fund revenues that are presently forecast for 2000.

 Background (Include justification for the legislation and funding history, if applicable):

 The Neighborhood Matching Fund program was established in 1987 (per Ordinance #113750) to fund neighborhood-based self-help projects, including capital improvements, planning, and other projects sponsored by community organizations.

 In mid-1998, the City doubled the Neighborhood Matching Subfund (NMF) in response to an increasing number of eligible applications. The NMF was funded at $3.75 million in the 2000 adopted budget in order to continue to support community initiatives and to provide another tool for implementing neighborhood plans. Subsequently, Council Resolution 30167 accepting the City's 2000 Community Development Block Grant and Human Service Program Allocation Plan reduced the planned NMF allocation from CDBG by $38,000; reducing the 2000 NMF to a total of $3.712 million. With this addition of one-time funding from excess revenue, the 2000 Neighborhood Matching Fund will be funded at $4.087 million. If revenues continue in 2000, it is the Mayor's intent to at least sustain this level of funding for the program.
