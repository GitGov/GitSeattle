 AN ORDINANCE relating to the Strategic Planning Office; authorizing execution of a Waterfront Parking Project Agreement; accepting funds from project partners; and increasing the appropriation authority therefor in the 2001 Adopted Budget of the Strategic Planning Office, all by a three-fourths vote of the City Council.

 WHEREAS, the City adopted a Downtown Plan in 1985 and a Harborfront Public Improvement Plan in 1987, proposing revitalization of the downtown Elliott Bay Waterfront though public and private investments that would reunite the waterfront with the downtown, strengthen its maritime character, and enhance public access; and

 WHEREAS, those plans have been substantially implemented through actions such as the development of the Bell Harbor International Conference Center, Cruise Ship facilities, retail, office and residential development; and

 WHEREAS, further implementation of those plans through the development of a new Pacific Northwest Aquarium, the Olympic Sculpture Park, a new waterfront hotel and potential re-use of Pier 48 is currently planned or under development; and

 WHEREAS, these waterfront uses have increased and will further increase the demand for travel to waterfront destinations, including the demand for parking facilities for automobile trips; and

 WHEREAS, the Strategic Planning Office has formed a partnership with the Department of Parks & Recreation, the Metropolitan Improvement District, the Pike Place Market Preservation & Development Authority, and the Port of Seattle to address waterfront parking issues; and

 WHEREAS, the increased demand for parking presents challenges to the partners and the interests of the businesses, organizations, and citizens represented by the partners; and

 WHEREAS, the partners believe that those challenges may most efficiently and effectively be addressed through the development and implementation of a Waterfront Parking Strategy; and

 WHEREAS, the goals of the Waterfront Parking Strategy are as follows: to provide comprehensive parking solutions for waterfront cultural, recreational, retail and tourism activities; to provide solutions that do not overwhelm the area with additional traffic or detract from commercial and residential parking supply; and to identify investments in pedestrian and transit connections that make off-site parking solutions feasible;
