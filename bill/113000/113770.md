Such plans shall indicate the permanent grade established and depth of cover over any existing pipelines and other existing utilities, and shall show the drainage pattern within the vicinity.

 12. County and Association agree to maintain compliance with any and all environmental laws and not to cause or permit the property to become contaminated with any hazardous substances in violation of environmental laws. In the event the property becomes contaminated resulting from County's and Association's use for the purposes herein granted, County and Association agree to clean up and remediate damage to property and to bring the property in compliance with the environmental laws. County and Association agree to indemnify, release and hold harmless the City from any environmental liability which may arise out of, result from, or be related to County's and Association's past, present, or future contamination of the property.
