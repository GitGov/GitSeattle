 ORDINANCE __________________

 AN ORDINANCE relating to prospective residential tenants and tenant screening reports, adding a new chapter 7.28 to Title 7 of the Seattle Municipal Code and amending chapter 7.24 of the Seattle Municipal Code in connection therewith.

 WHEREAS, the City Council finds that low and moderate income people are being excluded from applying for housing because of fees for tenant screening services that must be paid to each prospective landlord to whom they submit a rental application; and

 WHEREAS, tenant screening reports cost on average between $14 and $35; and

 WHEREAS, tenants currently have no opportunity to review tenant screening reports for inaccuracies and consequently, have no opportunity to prove to prospective landlords that the report is inaccurate; and

 WHEREAS, during periods of low vacancy rates and greater competition for a fewer number of available rental units prospective tenants find that the amount of money they must pay to tenant screening services for multiple copies of identical reports is prohibitive; and

 WHEREAS, the Council finds that it is necessary to impose additional requirements on landlords who use tenant screening services; and

 NOW THEREFORE,

 BE IT ORDAINED BY THE CITY OF SEATTLE AS FOLLOWS:

 Section 1. A new chapter 7.28 is added to Title 7 as follows:

 Chapter 7.28--Residential Tenant Screening Reports

 SMC 7.28.010 Copy of Tenant Screening Report to be Provided to Tenant

 If a prospective landlord obtains a tenant screening report concerning a prospective tenant pursuant to the authority of RCW 59.18.257 and if a prospective tenant requests a copy of the report either orally or in writing, the landlord must provide the prospective tenant with a copy of the report as soon as it is available to the landlord, but no later than within two (2) business days of its receipt by the landlord. On any written rental application, a landlord that requires a tenant screening report shall inform a prospective tenant of the tenant's right to receive a copy of the report, shall provide a place on the application for the tenant to indicate whether the tenant wants a copy of the report, and shall require the tenant to provide an address where the report should be sent. Unless otherwise agreed between the landlord and the prospective tenant(s), the tenant's copy of the tenant screening report must be mailed by regular mail to the current address of the prospective tenant listed on the rental application.

 SMC 7.28.020 Accepting Prior Screening Reports Required and Duplicative Charges Prohibited.

 A prospective landlord must accept a substantially similar copy of a tenant screening report for a prospective tenant if it was obtained by another prospective landlord and dated within the preceding forty-five (45) days, unless the landlord has reason to believe that the copy of the report has been altered. A prospective landlord may not charge a prospective tenant for the cost of obtaining a tenant screening report if the prospective tenant provides the landlord an unaltered copy of a tenant screening report dated within the preceding forty-five (45) days pursuant to this section.

 SMC 7.28.030 Definitions.

 For purposes of this chapter, the terms used in this chapter have the following meanings:

 (a) "Landlord" means a "landlord" as defined in and within the scope of RCW 59.18.030 and RCW 59.18.040 of the Residential Landlord Tenant Act of 1973 ("RLTA") in effect on the date of the passage of this ordinance.

 (b) "Tenant" means a "tenant" as defined in and within the scope of RCW 59.18.030 and RCW 59.18.040 of the Residential Landlord Tenant Act of 1973 ("RLTA") in effect on the date of the passage of this ordinance.
