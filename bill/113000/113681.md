The TDRs shall be acquired from the property known as International District Village Square Phase I located at 803 South Lane Street in Seattle (the "Project"), legally described as follows:

 LOTS 1 TO 8, INCLUSIVE, BLOCK 3, TERRY'S 5TH ADDITION TO THE CITY OF SEATTLE, ACCORDING TO THE PLAT THEREOF RECORDED IN VOLUME 2 OF PLATS, PAGE 55, IN KING COUNTY, WASHINGTON;

 AND EXCEPT THE EAST 112 FEET THEREOF CONDEMNED IN KING COUNTY SUPERIOR COURT CAUSE NO. 600725 FOR PRIMARY STATE HIGHWAY 1.

 Section 3.
