 ORDINANCE _______

 AN ORDINANCE relating to the Executive Services Department; authorizing sale of Lots 1-4, Block 25, H. L. Yesler's First Addition, commonly known as the Odessa Brown Building, a Seattle Model Cities Program acquisition, to First Place, a nonprofit corporation; and designating the disposition of sales proceeds.

 WHEREAS, Ordinance 98949 authorized the City to acquire, and Ordinances 99973 and 99591 authorized and funded remodeling of, the former Herzl synagogue located at 172 - 20th Avenue in Seattle, Washington, for use as a neighborhood health center; and

 WHEREAS, Ordinance 99135 accepted the deed for such property for the Seattle Model Cities Program; and

 WHEREAS, the neighborhood health center has since relocated to the Carolyn Downs facility at 2101 East Yesler Way; and

 WHEREAS, the City currently leases the building located at 172 - 20th Avenue, which is commonly known as the Odessa Brown Building, to tenants, including the First A.M.E. Child and Family Center, which serves low-income children and families, and the Children's Alliance and its subtenants; and

 WHEREAS, First Place, a non-profit school for homeless children is currently located in a building immediately adjacent to the Odessa Brown Building, and is in need of a larger facility in order to serve the homeless children it now must turn away; and

 WHEREAS, First Place wishes to purchase the Odessa Brown Building as it has determined that the building is suitably located and is of sufficient size for its program expansion, and

 WHEREAS, the October 21, 1999 "One Night Count" of people who are homeless in Seattle identified 339 homeless children between the ages six and twelve, and an additional 206 homeless children between the ages of thirteen to seventeen; and

 WHEREAS, homeless children who are unable to attend regular Seattle Public Schools fall behind in academic achievement and commonly suffer from a variety of emotional and behavioral problems resulting from the lack of stability in their lives; and

 WHEREAS, in addition to an accredited primary education, First Place provides supportive services in a nurturing environment aimed at fostering a positive adjustment to more permanent educational placements when homeless families secure stable housing; and

 WHEREAS, the City has an interest in having First Place expand its capacity to serve a larger number of homeless children, but does not wish to impair the ability of current tenants in the Odessa Brown Building to function in support of the City's human service policy goals; and

 WHEREAS, First Place would benefit by the continuing presence of the First A.M.E. Child and Family Center, which serves low-income children and families, and by Children's Alliance and its subtenants; and

 WHEREAS, the Central Area Neighborhood Plan, in its vision for Human and Social Services, states that "Neighborhoods will welcome and provide opportunities and amenities for youth, elderly persons, and special needs populations;" and

 WHEREAS, Resolution 30076 outlined the minimal conditions under which the City Council would consider the sale of the Odessa Brown Building to First Place; and

 WHEREAS, First Place has responded to two of the three conditions for the sale set forth in Resolution 30076 by providing the City with a copy of its capital campaign fundraising plan and signing an agreement with Children's Alliance for its relocated spaces; and

 WHEREAS, the contract attached to this Ordinance, which is substantially in final form, provides terms under which the third condition in Resolution 30076 requiring an agreement with First AME Child and Family Center would be equitably satisfied; and

 WHEREAS, the 74 year old Odessa Brown Building has required, and is expected to continue to require, major maintenance expenditures; and

 WHEREAS, the availability of the property has been circulated to other City and government agencies, and no responses of interest have been received; NOW, THEREFORE,

 BE IT ORDAINED BY THE CITY OF SEATTLE AS FOLLOWS:
