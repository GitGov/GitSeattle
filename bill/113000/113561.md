 WHEREAS, a dispute that is not properly addressed can have far-reaching negative impacts on the productivity of the workforce and the livability of the workplace; and

 WHEREAS, the City has developed an Alternative Dispute Resolution Program that will address conflict at the earliest possible stage and the lowest level of intervention, and will provide tools to help the workforce manage conflict effectively;

The Personnel Director shall implement and administer the Alternative Dispute Resolution Program substantially in accord with the City of Seattle Alternative Dispute Resolution Program Management Plan, which is incorporated by this reference.

 B. The Alternative Dispute Resolution Program (hereinafter referred to as the Program) will consist of a mediation component to promote the resolution of disputes through mediation, conciliation and conversation facilitated by a neutral third party; a

 training component to develop conflict resolution skills in managers and employees; and a group facilitation component to provide problem-solving resources for workgroups in conflict.

 E. Regularly appointed full-time and part-time employees, including exempt, probationary and regular employees, are eligible to participate in the Program. Temporary workers, including seasonal, intermittent, on-call and contract employees and workers employed through City Personnel's Special Employment Programs Unit may not initiate a mediation or related activity through the Program, but may, at the discretion of the Alternative Dispute Resolution Coordinator, participate in a mediation or related activity that has been initiated by a regularly appointed employee or employees.

 F. Time spent in an official mediation or related activity shall be considered regular pay hours for compensation purposes.
