 WHEREAS, pursuant to Section 24 of Ordinance 116705, the City reserved the right to issue revenue bonds that are a charge and lien on the Gross Revenue of the Municipal Water System subordinate to the charge or lien of the Prior Lien Bonds; and

 WHEREAS, by Ordinance 117689 and Resolution 29191, the City issued its Forty-Five Million Dollars ($45,000,000) original principal amount Water System Adjustable Rate Revenue Bonds, 1995 (the "1995 Bonds"), subordinate to the lien and charge of the Prior Lien Bonds; and

 WHEREAS, by Section 15 of Ordinance 117689, the City reserved the right to issue revenue bonds and other obligations having a charge and lien upon the Net Revenue of the Municipal Water System on a parity with the charge and lien on the 1995 Bonds ("Future Parity Bonds") if the following conditions are met and complied with at the time of issuance of those Future Parity Bonds:

 (a) There shall be no deficiency in the Bond Account and no Event of Default as defined in Section 25 of Ordinance 117689 shall have occurred and be continuing.

 (b) The Parity Bond Authorizing Ordinance shall provide that all assessments and interest thereon that may be levied in any ULID created for the purpose of paying, in whole or in part, the principal of and interest on those Future Parity Bonds, shall be paid directly into the Bond Account, except for any prepaid assessments permitted by law to be paid into a construction fund or account.

 (c) The Parity Bond Authorizing Ordinance shall provide for the payment of the principal thereof and interest thereon out of the Bond Account.

 (e) There shall be on file with the City either:

 (1) a certificate of the Director of Finance demonstrating that during any twelve consecutive calendar months out of the immediately preceding twenty-four (24) calendar months Adjusted Net Revenue was at least equal to the Coverage Requirement for all Parity Bonds plus the Future Parity Bonds proposed to be issued (and assuming that the debt service of the proposed Future Parity Bonds for that twelve-month period was the Average Annual Debt Service for those proposed bonds); or

 (2) a certificate of both the Director of Finance and the Superintendent of the Municipal Water System (or any officer who succeeds to substantially all of the responsibilities of either office) that in their opinion the Adjusted Net Revenue for the five fiscal years next following the earlier of (i) the end of the period during which interest on those Future Parity Bonds is to be capitalized or, if no interest is capitalized, the fiscal year in which the Future Parity Bonds are issued, or (ii) the date on which substantially all new facilities financed with those Future Parity Bonds are expected to commence operations, such Adjusted Net Revenue further adjusted as provided in paragraphs (i) through (iv) below, will be at least equal to the Coverage Requirement.

 (i) Any changes in rates in effect and being charged, or rates expected to be charged in accordance with a program of specific rates, rate levels or increases in overall rate revenue approved by ordinance or resolution;

 (ii) Net revenue from customers of the Municipal Water System who have become customers during the twelve (12) consecutive month period or thereafter, and their estimate of net revenue from any customers to be connected to the Municipal Water System who have paid the required connection charges, adjusted to reflect one year's net revenue from those customers;

 (iii) Their estimate of net revenue from customers anticipated to be served by facilities or improvements financed in substantial part by those Future Parity Bonds (or additional Parity Bonds expected to be issued during the five-year period); and

 (iv) Net revenue from any person, firm, corporation or municipal corporation under any executed contract for water or other utility service, which revenue was not included in the historical Net Revenue of the Municipal Water System.

 BE IT ORDAINED BY THE CITY OF SEATTLE, WASHINGTON, AS FOLLOWS:

 Section 1. Definitions

 . As used in this ordinance and for the purposes of this ordinance the following words shall have the following meanings:

 "Accreted Value" means:

 (1) with respect to any Capital Appreciation Bonds, as of the time of calculation, the sum of the amount representing the initial principal amount of such Capital Appreciation Bonds as set forth in the applicable Parity Bond Authorizing Ordinance plus the interest accumulated, compounded and unpaid thereon as of the most recent compounding date, or

 (2) with respect to original issue discount bonds under the Code, as of the time of calculation, the amount representing the initial public offering price of such original issue discount bonds plus the amount of the discounted principal which has accreted since the date of issue, determined in accordance with the provisions of the applicable Parity Bond Authorizing Ordinance.

 "Adjusted Annual Debt Service" for any fiscal year means Annual Debt Service minus (1) an amount equal to ULID Assessments due in that year and not delinquent, (2) an amount equal to earnings from investments in any Series Reserve Subaccounts and (3) Annual Debt Service provided for by Parity Bond proceeds.

 "Adjusted Gross Revenue of the Municipal Water System" or "Adjusted Gross Revenue" means Gross Revenue of the Municipal Water System plus withdrawals from the Rate Stabilization Account and minus (1) ULID Assessments, (2) earnings from investments in any Series Reserve Subaccounts and in any bond or reserve accounts established to provide for debt service on Prior Lien Bonds and (3) deposits into the Rate Stabilization Account.

 "Adjusted Net Revenue of the Municipal Water System" or "Adjusted Net Revenue" means Adjusted Gross Revenue less Operation and Maintenance Expenses and less Prior Lien Bond Debt Service.

 "Annual Debt Service" means, for any fiscal year of the City, all amounts required to be paid in respect of interest on and principal of Parity Bonds and Payment Agreement Payments in respect of Parity Payment Agreements, subject to the following:

 (i) Debt Service on Term Bonds. For purposes of calculating debt service on Term Bonds, only the scheduled mandatory redemption amounts payable in respect of principal of Term Bonds shall be taken into account in any fiscal year prior to the Term Bond Maturity Year, and only the principal amount scheduled to remain outstanding after payment of all prior mandatory redemption amounts shall be taken into account in the Term Bond Maturity Year;

 (ii) Interest on Parity Bonds. For purposes of determining compliance with the Coverage Requirement, the Series Reserve Requirement (unless otherwise provided in a Parity Bond Authorizing Ordinance) and conditions for the issuance of Future Parity Bonds,

 (A) Generally. Except as otherwise provided by subparagraph (ii)(B) with respect to Variable Interest Rate Bonds and by subparagraph (ii)(C) with respect to Parity Bonds with respect to which a Payment Agreement is in force, interest on any issue of Parity Bonds shall be calculated based on the actual amount of accrued, accreted or otherwise accumulated interest that is payable in respect of that issue taken as a whole, at the rate or rates set forth in the Parity Bond Authorizing Ordinance;

 (B) Interest on Variable Interest Rate Bonds. The amount of interest deemed to be payable on any issue of Variable Interest Rate Bonds shall be calculated on the assumption that the interest rate on those bonds would be equal to the rate (the "assumed RBI- based rate") that is ninety percent (90%) of the average RBI during the fiscal quarter preceding the quarter in which the calculation is made;

 (C) Interest on Parity Bonds With Respect to Which a Payment Agreement is in Force. Debt service on Parity Bonds with respect to which a Payment Agreement is in force shall be based on the net economic effect on the City expected to be produced by the terms of the Parity Bonds and the terms of the Payment Agreement, including but not limited to the effects that (i) Parity Bonds that would, but for a Payment Agreement, be treated as obligations bearing interest at a Variable Interest Rate instead shall be treated as obligations bearing interest at a fixed interest rate, and (ii) Parity Bonds that would, but for a Payment Agreement, be treated as obligations bearing interest at a fixed interest rate instead shall be treated as obligations bearing interest at a Variable Interest Rate. Accordingly, the amount of interest deemed to be payable on any Parity Bonds with respect to which a Payment Agreement is in force shall be an amount equal to the amount of interest that would be payable at the rate or rates stated in those Parity Bonds plus Payment Agreement Payments minus Payment Agreement Receipts. For the purposes of calculating as nearly as practicable Payment Agreement Receipts and Payment Agreement Payments under a Payment Agreement, the following assumptions shall be made:

 (1) Counterparty Obligated to Pay Actual Variable Interest on Variable Interest Rate Bonds. If any Payment Agreement obligates a Qualified Counterparty to make payments to the City based on the actual Variable Interest Rate on Parity Bonds that would, but for the Payment Agreement, be treated as Variable Interest Rate Bonds and obligates the City to make payments to the Qualified Counterparty based on a fixed rate, payments by the City to the Qualified Counterparty shall be assumed to be made at the fixed rate specified by the Payment Agreement and payments by the Qualified Counterparty to the City shall be assumed to be made at the actual Variable Interest Rate on such Parity Bonds, without regard to the occurrence of any event that, under the provisions of the Payment Agreement, would permit the Qualified Counterparty to make payments on any basis other than the actual Variable Interest Rate on such Parity Bonds, and the Parity Bond Authorizing Ordinance shall set forth a debt service schedule for those Parity Bonds based on that assumption;

 (2) Variable Interest Rate Bonds and Payment Agreements Having the Same Variable Rate Component. If both a Payment Agreement and related Parity Bonds that would, but for the Payment Agreement, be treated as Variable Interest Rate Bonds include a variable rate payment component that is required to be calculated on the same basis (including, without limitation, on the basis of the same variable rate index), it shall be assumed that the variable rate payment component payable pursuant to the Payment Agreement is equal in amount to the variable rate interest component payable on those Parity Bonds;

 (3) Variable Interest Rate Bonds and Payment Agreements Having Different Variable Rate Interest Components. If a Payment Agreement obligates either the City or the Qualified Counterparty to make payments of a variable rate interest component on a basis that is different (including, without limitation, on a different variable rate index) from the basis that is required to be used to calculate interest on the Parity Bonds that would, but for the Payment Agreement, be treated as Variable Interest Rate Bonds, it shall be assumed:

 (a) City Obligated to Make Payments Based on Variable Rate Index. If payments by the City under the Payment Agreement are to be based on a variable rate index and payments by the Qualified Counterparty are to be based on a fixed rate, that payments by the City to the Qualified Counterparty will be based upon an interest rate equal to the assumed RBI-based rate, and that payments by the Qualified Counterparty to the City will be based on the fixed rate specified by the Payment Agreement; and

 (b) City Obligated to Make Payments Based on Fixed Rate. If payments by the City under the Payment Agreement are to be based on a fixed rate and payments by the Qualified Counterparty are to be based on a variable rate index, that payments by the City to the Qualified Counterparty will be based on an interest rate equal to the rate (the "assumed fixed payor rate") that is one hundred and five percent (105%) of the fixed rate specified by the Payment Agreement, and that payments by the Qualified Counterparty to the City will be based on a rate equal to the actual Variable Interest Rate on the Variable Interest Rate Bonds;

 (4) Certain Payment Agreements May be Disregarded. Notwithstanding the provisions of subparagraphs (ii)(C)(1), (2) and (3) of this definition, the City shall not be required to (but may in its discretion) take into account in determining Annual Debt Service the effects of any Payment Agreement that has a term of ten (10) years or less;

 (D) Debt Service on Parity Payment Agreements. No additional debt service shall be taken into account with respect to a Parity Payment Agreement for any period during which Payment Agreement Payments on that Parity Payment Agreement are taken into account in determining Annual Debt Service on related Parity Bonds under subparagraph (ii)(C) of this definition. However, for any period during which Payment Agreement Payments are not taken into account in calculating Annual Debt Service on any outstanding Parity Bonds because the Parity Payment Agreement is not then related to any outstanding Parity Bonds, debt service on that Parity Payment Agreement shall be taken into account by assuming:

 (1) City Obligated to Make Payments Based on Fixed Rate. If the City is obligated to make Payment Agreement Payments based on a fixed rate and the Qualified Counterparty is obligated to make payments based on a variable rate index, that payments by the City will be based on the assumed fixed payor rate, and that payments by the Qualified Counterparty will be based on a rate equal to the average rate determined by the variable rate index specified by the Parity Payment Agreement during the fiscal quarter preceding the quarter in which the calculation is made, and

 (2) City Obligated to Make Payments Based on Variable Rate Index. If the City is obligated to make Payment Agreement Payments based on a variable rate index and the Qualified Counterparty is obligated to make payment based on a fixed rate, that payments by the City will be based on a rate equal to the average rate determined by the variable rate index specified by the Parity Payment Agreement during the fiscal quarter preceding the quarter in which the calculation is made, and that the Qualified Counterparty will make payments based on the fixed rate specified by the Parity Payment Agreement; and

 (E) Balloon Bonds. For purposes of calculating debt service on any Balloon Bonds, it shall be assumed that the principal of those Balloon Bonds, together with interest thereon at a rate equal to the assumed RBI-based rate, will be amortized in equal annual installments over a term of thirty (30) years.

 Only Bonds bearing a Certificate of Authentication in the following form, manually signed by the Bond Registrar, shall be valid or obligatory for any purpose or entitled to the benefits of this ordinance:

 CERTIFICATE OF AUTHENTICATION

 This bond is one of the fully registered The City of Seattle, Washington, Water System Adjustable Rate Revenue Bonds, 2002, described in the Bond Ordinance.

 WASHINGTON STATE FISCAL AGENCY

 Bond Registrar

 By

 Authorized Signer

 The authorized signing of a Certificate of Authentication shall be conclusive evidence that the Bonds so authenticated have been duly executed, authenticated and delivered and are entitled to the benefits of this ordinance.

 If any officer whose manual or facsimile signature appears on the Bonds ceases to be an officer of the City authorized to sign bonds before the Bonds bearing his or her manual or facsimile signature are authenticated or delivered by the Bond Registrar or issued by the City, those Bonds nevertheless may be authenticated, delivered and issued and, when authenticated, issued and delivered, shall be as binding on the City as though that person had continued to be an officer of the City authorized to sign bonds. Any Bond also may be signed on behalf of the City by any person who, on the actual date of signing of the Bond, is an officer of the City authorized to sign bonds, although he or she did not hold the required office on the date of issuance of the Bonds.

 Notwithstanding the foregoing provision of this Section 7, the Bond Sale Resolution may specify different provisions relating to the form and execution of the Bonds, so long as those different provisions are consistent with the purposes of this ordinance.

 Section 8. Bond Registrar; Appointment of Other Agents

 . The Bond Registrar shall keep, or cause to be kept, at its principal corporate trust office, sufficient books for the registration and transfer of the Bonds which shall at all times be open to inspection by the City. The Bond Registrar is authorized, on behalf of the City, to authenticate and deliver Bonds transferred or exchanged in accordance with the provisions of the Bonds and this ordinance, to serve as the City's paying agent for the Bonds and to carry out all of the Bond Registrar's powers and duties under this ordinance and Seattle Municipal Code Chapter 5.10 establishing a system of registration for the City's bonds and obligations, as that chapter now exists or may be hereafter amended.

 The Bond Registrar shall be responsible for its representations contained in the Bond Registrar's Certificate of Authentication on the Bonds. The Bond Registrar may become the owner of Bonds with the same rights it would have if it were not the Bond Registrar and, to the extent permitted by law, may act as depository for and permit any of its officers or directors to act as members of, or in any other capacity with respect to, any committee formed to protect the rights of Bond owners.

 The City may in the Bond Sale Resolution appoint or provide for the appointment by the Director of Finance of a tender agent or agents, a paying agent or agents, a remarketing agent or agents and one or more bank or other financial institution furnishing liquidity and/or credit support for the Bonds, any or all of which may, but need not, be the Bond Registrar. The Bond Sale Resolution shall authorize contracts respecting the duties of those agents, the bank and the City with respect to the Bonds, and shall authorize the appropriate officers of the City to execute those contracts.

 Section 9. Bond Account

 . Ordinance 117689 created the Bond Account, known as the Second Lien Water Revenue Bond Account, in the Water Fund and further divided the Bond Account into the Principal and Interest Subaccount and, with respect to any series of Parity Bonds for which a Series Reserve Requirement has been provided, a Series Reserve Subaccount. So long as any Parity Bonds are outstanding, the City shall set aside and pay into the Bond Account all ULID Assessments on their collection (except for ULID Assessments deposited in a construction account) and, out of the Net Revenue, certain fixed amounts without regard to any fixed proportion, namely:

 (a) Into the Principal and Interest Subaccount on or before each interest or principal and interest payment date of any Parity Bonds at least an amount which, together with other money on deposit therein, will be sufficient to pay the interest, or principal and interest, to become due and payable on the Parity Bonds on that payment date, including any Parity Bonds subject to mandatory redemption on that date, and net payments due on Parity Payment Agreements; and

 (b) Into any Series Reserve Subaccount, such amounts at such times as may be required in the ordinance or resolution (including without limitation the Bond Sale Resolution) authorizing or providing the terms, conditions and covenants relating to the series of Parity Bonds for which a Series Reserve Requirement shall have been provided. The City may provide all or any part of a Series Reserve Requirement through Reserve Insurance, and the amount available to be drawn upon under that Reserve Insurance shall be credited against the Series Reserve Requirement subject to such terms and conditions as may be provided in the ordinance or resolution authorizing or providing the terms, conditions and covenants relating to the series of Parity Bonds for which a Series Reserve Requirement shall have been provided.

 All money in the Bond Account may be kept in cash or invested in legal investments maturing, for investments in the Principal and Interest Subaccount, not later than the dates when, in the reasonable judgement of the Director of Finance, such funds are required for the payment of principal of and/or interest on the Parity Bonds and, for investments in a Series Reserve Subaccount, maturing (or subject to redemption, or repurchase and redemption, at the option of the City) on a date or dates provided in the ordinance or resolution authorizing or providing the terms, conditions and covenants relating to a series of Parity Bonds for which a Series Reserve Requirement has been provided.

 Earnings from investments in the Principal and Interest Subaccount shall be deposited in that account. Earnings from investments in a Series Reserve Subaccount shall be deposited as may be directed by the ordinance or bond sale resolution providing for a Series Reserve Requirement. Notwithstanding the provisions for the deposit of earnings, any earnings that are subject to federal arbitrage rebate requirements may be withdrawn from the Bond Account for deposit into a separate fund or account created for the purpose of compliance with those rebate requirements.

 The City may create sinking fund accounts or other accounts in the Bond Account, including but not limited to interest reserve accounts, for the payment or securing the payment of Parity Bonds as long as the maintenance of such accounts does not conflict with the rights of the owners of such Parity Bonds.

 Section 10. Construction Account

 . There has been created in the Water Fund an account known as the Water System Construction Account, within which account there is created a subaccount to be known as the Water System Construction Subaccount, 2002 (the "Construction Account"). The principal proceeds of the sale of the Bonds remaining after the deposit of accrued interest on the Bonds, if any, into the Principal and Interest Subaccount and the deposit of any proceeds as determined by the Bond Sale Resolution into a Series Reserve Subaccount (if any), shall be deposited into the Construction Account to be used for the purpose of paying part of the costs of carrying out the Plan of Additions and to pay for the costs of issuance of the Bonds. Until needed to pay such costs, the City may invest principal proceeds and interest thereon temporarily in any legal investment, and the investment earnings may, as determined by the Director of Finance, be retained in the Construction Account and be spent for the purposes of that fund or deposited in the Bond Account.

 Section 11. Findings as to Sufficiency of Gross Revenue, Due Regard and Satisfaction of Parity Conditions

 . The City finds and determines that the Gross Revenue and benefits to be derived from the operation and maintenance of the Municipal Water System of the City at the rates to be charged for water and other services and commodities from the Municipal Water System will be more than sufficient to meet all Operation and Maintenance Expenses, to meet all requirements with respect to the payment of principal of and interest on and providing the reserve requirements for the Prior Lien Bonds, and to permit the setting aside into the Bond Account out of that Gross Revenue of amounts sufficient to pay the principal of and interest on the Outstanding Parity Bonds and the Bonds and any mandatory redemption requirements when due. The City further declares that in creating the Bond Account and in fixing the amounts to be paid into the Bond Account it has exercised due regard for Operation and Maintenance Expenses, and the City has not bound and obligated itself to set aside and pay into the Bond Account a greater amount or proportion of the Gross Revenue than in the judgment of the City will be available over and above the Operation and Maintenance Expenses, the amounts necessary to provide for the payment of Prior Lien Bond Debt Service and to provide the reserve requirement for the Prior Lien Bonds, and pay debt service and provide the reserve requirement, if any, on the Outstanding Parity Bonds.

 The City finds and declares that no default exists in the payment of the principal of and interest on the Outstanding Parity Bonds, and that the amounts required to have been paid into the Bond Account for the Outstanding Parity Bonds have been paid and maintained as required therein, and that all other conditions for the issuance of the Bonds as Future Parity Bonds under Section 15 of Ordinance 117689 will have been met and satisfied before the Bonds are delivered to the original purchaser[s] thereof.

 Section 12. Pledge of Net Revenue and Lien Position

 . The lien of the Bonds on the Net Revenue of the Municipal Water System shall be subordinate to the lien on such Net Revenue of the Prior Lien Bonds, and shall be on a parity of lien on such Net Revenue with the Outstanding Parity Bonds and any Future Parity Bonds that may be issued pursuant to [Section 15 of Ordinance 117689 and] Section 15 of this ordinance. Upon satisfaction of the conditions for parity bonds set forth in the ordinances under which the Prior Lien Bonds were and shall have been issued, if the interest on the Bonds is converted to a fixed rate or rates prior to maturity, then the Bonds so converted shall be on a parity of lien on the Net Revenue of the Municipal Water System with the Prior Lien Bonds, without regard to date of issuance or authorization and without preference or priority of right or lien with respect to participation of special funds in amounts from that Net Revenue for payment thereof. The Bonds also may be made to be on a parity of lien on the Net Revenue with the Prior Lien Bonds at any other time if the City so determines and upon the satisfaction of those conditions.

 The City reserves the right to issue (1) additional Prior Lien Bonds subject to the requirements for their issuance under the ordinances authorizing the issuance of Prior Lien Bonds; (2) additional Parity Bonds subject to the requirements of [Section 15 of Ordinance 117689 and] Section 15 of this ordinance; and (3) bonds and other obligations with a lien on the Net Revenue of the Municipal Water System subordinate to the lien of the Prior Lien Bonds and the Parity Bonds on that Net Revenue. The City may pledge the payment of utility local improvement district assessments into a bond redemption fund created for the payment of the principal of and interest on Prior Lien Bonds and also may pledge utility local improvement district assessments into a bond redemption fund created for the payment of principal of and interest on junior lien bonds as long as such utility local improvement district assessments are levied for improvements constructed from the proceeds of those junior lien bonds.

 Subject to the lien and charge on Net Revenue of the Prior Lien Bonds, the Net Revenue of the Municipal Water System and all money and investments held in the Bond Account, the Rate Stabilization Account and the Construction Account (except money and investments held in a separate fund or account created for the purpose of compliance with rebate requirements under the Code), is pledged to the payment of the Parity Bonds and to make payments into any Series Reserve Subaccount that may be required by the Bond Sale Resolution. This pledge shall constitute a lien and charge upon the Net Revenue prior and superior to any other charges whatsoever, other than the lien and charge of the Prior Lien Bonds.

 The Bonds are not a general obligation of the City or the State or any political subdivision of the State.

 Section 13. Covenants

 . The City covenants and agrees with the owner of each Bond at any time outstanding, as follows:

 (a) Operation and Maintenance. It will at all times maintain, preserve and keep the properties of the Municipal Water System in good repair, working order and condition, will make all necessary and proper additions, betterments, renewals and repairs thereto, and improvements, replacements and extensions thereof, and will at all times operate or cause to be operated the properties of the Municipal Water System and the business in connection therewith in an efficient manner and at a reasonable cost.

 (b) Establishment and Collection of Rates and Charges. It will establish, maintain and collect rates and charges for services and facilities provided by the Municipal Water System which will be fair and equitable, and will adjust those rates and charges from time to time so that:

 (1) The Gross Revenue will be sufficient to (i) pay all Operation and Maintenance Expenses, (ii) to pay when due the principal of and interest on the Prior Lien Bonds and to provide for the reserve requirement therefor, (iii) pay when due all amounts that the City is obligated to pay into the Bond Account and the subaccounts therein, and (iv) pay all taxes, assessments or other governmental charges lawfully imposed on the Municipal Water System or the revenue therefrom or payments in lieu thereof and any and all other amounts which the City may now or hereafter become obligated to pay from the Gross Revenue by law or contract; and

 (2) The Adjusted Net Revenue of the Municipal Water System in each fiscal year will be at least equal to the Coverage Requirement; and

 (3) Except to aid the poor or infirm and for fire-fighting purposes, it will not furnish or supply or permit the furnishing or supplying of any service or facility in connection with the operation of the Municipal Water System free of charge to any person, firm or corporation, public or private.

 The failure of the City to comply with subparagraphs (1) and (2) of this paragraph 13(b) shall not be an Event of Default as defined in Section 25 of this ordinance if the City promptly retains an Independent Consulting Engineer to recommend to the City Council adjustments in the rates of the Municipal Water System necessary to meet the requirements of those subparagraphs and if the City Council adopts the recommended modifications within one hundred eighty (180) days of the date the failure became known to the City Council.

 (c) Sale, Transfer or Disposition of the Municipal Water System. It will sell, transfer or otherwise dispose of any of the works, plant, properties, facilities or other part of the Municipal Water System or any real or personal property comprising a part of the Municipal Water System only upon approval by ordinance and only consistent with one or more of the following:

 (1) The City in its discretion may carry out such a sale, transfer or disposition (each, as used in this subparagraph, a "transfer") if the facilities or property transferred are not material to the operation of the Municipal Water System, or shall have become unserviceable, inadequate, obsolete or unfit to be used in the operation of the Municipal Water System or are no longer necessary, material or useful to the operation of the Municipal Water System; or

 (2) The City in its discretion may carry out such a transfer if the aggregate depreciated cost value of the facilities or property being transferred under this subparagraph (2) in any fiscal year comprises no more than three percent (3%) of the total assets of the Municipal Water System; or

 (3) The City in its discretion may carry out such a transfer if the City receives from the transferee an amount equal to the fair market value of the portion of the Municipal Water System transferred. As used in this subparagraph, "fair market value" means the most probable price that a property should bring in a competitive and open market under all conditions requisite to a fair sale, the willing buyer and willing seller each acting prudently and knowledgeably and assuming that the price is not affected by coercion or undue stimulus. The proceeds of the transfer shall be used (i) to promptly redeem, or irrevocably set aside for the redemption of, Prior Lien Bonds, or Prior Lien Bonds and Parity Bonds, all in accordance with the ordinances authorizing those bonds and/or (ii) to provide for part of the cost of additions to and betterments and extensions of the Municipal Water System. Before any such transfer under this subparagraph (3), the City must obtain a certificate of an Independent Consulting Engineer to the effect that in his or her professional opinion, upon such transfer and the use of proceeds of the transfer as proposed by the City, the remaining Municipal Water System will retain its operational integrity and the Adjusted Net Revenue of the Municipal Water System will be at least equal to the Coverage Requirement during the five fiscal years following the fiscal year in which the transfer is to occur, taking into account, (w) the reduction in revenue resulting from the transfer; (x) the use of any proceeds of the transfer for the redemption of Prior Lien Bonds, or Prior Lien Bonds and Parity Bonds, all in accordance with the ordinances authorizing those bonds, (y) the Independent Consulting Engineer's estimate of revenue from customers anticipated to be served by any additions to and betterments and extensions of the Municipal Water System financed in part by the proposed portion of the proceeds of the transfer, and (z) any other adjustment permitted in the preparation of a certificate under Section 15(e) of this ordinance. Before such a transfer, the City also must obtain confirmation from each of the Rating Agencies to the effect that the rating then in effect will not be reduced or withdrawn upon such transfer.

 The amount required to be paid to the City may be reduced by any "equity credits" or similar amounts based on prior capital contributions or other payments to the City which, under any contract between the City and the transferee, are allowed as a setoff against the transfer price that would otherwise be payable to the City.

 (d) Liens Upon the Municipal Water System. Except as otherwise provided in this ordinance, it will not at any time create or permit to accrue or to exist any lien or other encumbrance or indebtedness upon the Gross Revenue or any part thereof, prior or superior to the lien thereon for the payment of the Parity Bonds, and will pay and discharge, or cause to be paid and discharged, any and all lawful claims for labor, materials or supplies which, if unpaid, might become a lien or charge upon the Gross Revenue or any part thereof, prior or superior to, or on a parity with, the lien of the Parity Bonds, or which might impair the security of the Parity Bonds.

 (e) Books and Accounts. It will keep proper books, records and accounts with respect to the operations, income and expenditures of the Municipal Water System in accordance with generally accepted accounting practices relating to municipal utilities and any applicable rules and regulations prescribed by the State, and will cause those books, records and accounts to be audited on an annual basis by the State Auditor (or, if such audit is not made by the State Auditor within two hundred seventy (270) days after the close of any fiscal year of the City, by a certified public accountant selected by the City). It will prepare annual financial and operating statements as soon as practicable after the close of each fiscal year showing in reasonable detail the financial condition of the Municipal Water System as of the close of the previous year, and the income and expenses for such year, including the amounts paid into the Bond Account and into any and all special funds or accounts created pursuant to the provisions of this ordinance, the status of all funds and accounts as of the end of such year, and the amounts expended for maintenance, renewals, replacements and capital additions to the Municipal Water System. Such statements shall be sent to the owner of any Parity Bonds upon written request therefor being made to the City. The City may charge a reasonable cost for providing such financial statements.

 (f) Collection of Delinquent Accounts. On at least an annual basis, it will determine all accounts that are delinquent and will take such actions as the City determined are reasonably necessary to enforce payment of those delinquent accounts.

 (g) Maintenance of Insurance. It at all times will carry fire and extended coverage, public liability and property damage and such other forms of insurance with responsible insurers and with policies payable to the City on such of the buildings, equipment, works, plants, facilities and properties of the Municipal Water System as are ordinarily carried by municipal or privately owned utilities engaged in the operation of like systems, and against such claims for damages as are ordinarily carried by municipal or privately owned utilities engaged in the operation of like systems, or it will self-insure or will participate in an insurance pool or pools with reserves adequate, in the reasonable judgment of the City, to protect the Municipal Water System and the owners of the Parity Bonds against loss.

 (h) Condemnation Awards and Insurance Proceeds. If the City receives any condemnation awards or proceeds of an insurance policy in connection with any loss of or damage to any property of the Municipal Water System, it shall apply the condemnation award or insurance proceeds, in the City's sole discretion, either (i) to the cost of replacing or repairing the lost or damaged properties, (ii) to the payment, purchase or redemption of Prior Lien Bonds or Parity Bonds, or (iii) to the cost of improvements to the Municipal Water System.

 Section 14. Flow of Funds

 . All ULID Assessments shall be paid into the Bond Account as provided by this ordinance. The Gross Revenue of the Municipal Water System shall be used for the following purposes only and shall be applied in the following order of priority:

 (a) To pay the Operation and Maintenance Expenses;

 (b) To pay, when due, interest on Prior Lien Bonds and net payments on Payment Agreements entered into on a parity with Prior Lien Bonds;

 (c) To pay the principal of Prior Lien Bonds as it comes due at maturity or as the principal is required to be paid pursuant to mandatory redemption requirements applicable to Prior Lien Bonds that are term bonds, and to make payments due under any reimbursement agreement with a bond insurer which agreement requires those payments to be treated on a parity of lien with the Prior Lien Bonds;

 (d) To make all payments required to be made with respect to reserve requirements for the Prior Lien Bonds, including without limitation payments under any agreement relating to reserve insurance and payments due under any reimbursement agreement with a bond insurer which agreement requires those payments to be treated on a parity of lien with payments required to be made into the reserve account for the Prior Lien Bonds;

 (e) To pay interest on Parity Bonds and net payments on Parity Payment Agreements when due;

 (f) To pay the principal of Parity Bonds as it comes due at maturity or as the principal is required to be paid pursuant to mandatory redemption requirements applicable to Term Bonds, and to make payments due under any reimbursement agreement with a Bond Insurer which agreement requires those payments to be treated on a parity of lien with the Parity Bonds;

 (g) To make all payments required to be made into the Reserve Subaccounts, all payments required to be made under any agreement relating to the provision of Reserve Insurance, and payments due under any reimbursement agreement with a Bond Insurer which agreement requires those payments to be treated on a parity of lien with the payments required to be made into the Series Reserve Subaccount;

 (h) To make all payments required to be made into any revenue bond, note, warrant or other revenue obligation redemption fund, debt service account or reserve account created to pay or secure the payment of the principal of and interest on any revenue bonds, notes, warrants or other obligations of the City having a lien upon the revenue of the Municipal Water System junior and inferior to the lien thereon for the payment of the principal of and interest on the Parity Bonds; and

 (i) To retire by redemption or purchase in the open market any outstanding revenue bonds or other revenue obligations of the Municipal Water System, to make necessary additional betterments, improvements and repairs to or extensions and replacements of the Municipal Water System, to make deposits into the Rate Stabilization Account, or for any other lawful Municipal Water System purposes.

 The City may transfer any money from any funds or accounts of the Municipal Water System legally available therefor, except Prior Lien Bond redemption funds, refunding escrow funds or defeasance funds, and funds created for money to be rebated to the United States pursuant to the Code, to meet the required payments to be made into the Bond Account.

 Section 15. Provisions for Future Parity Bonds

 . The City reserves the right to issue Future Parity Bonds and to enter into Parity Payment Agreements for purposes of the Municipal Water System or to refund a portion of the Parity Bonds if the following conditions are met and complied with at the time of the issuance of those Future Parity Bonds or entering into the Parity Payment Agreement:

 (a) There shall be no deficiency in the Bond Account and no Event of Default as defined in Section 24 hereof shall have occurred and be continuing.

 (b) The Parity Bond Authorizing Ordinance shall provide that all assessments and interest thereon that may be levied in any ULID created for the purpose of paying, in whole or in part, the principal of and interest on those Future Parity Bonds, shall be paid directly into the Bond Account, except for any prepaid assessments permitted by law to be paid into a construction fund or account.

 (c) The Parity Bond Authorizing Ordinance shall provide for the payment of the principal thereof and interest thereon out of the Bond Account.

 (d) The Parity Bond Authorizing Ordinance shall provide for the payment of amounts into the Bond Account to meet mandatory redemption requirements applicable to any Term Bonds to be issued and for regular payments to be made for the payment of the principal of such Term Bonds on or before their maturity, or, as an alternative, the mandatory redemption of those Term Bonds prior to their maturity date from money in the Principal and Interest Subaccount.

 (e) There shall be on file with the City either:

 (1) a certificate of the Director of Finance demonstrating that during any twelve consecutive calendar months out of the immediately preceding twenty-four (24) calendar months Adjusted Net Revenue was at least equal to the Coverage Requirement for all Parity Bonds plus the Future Parity Bonds proposed to be issued (and assuming that the debt service of the proposed Future Parity Bonds for that twelve-month period was the Average Annual Debt Service for those proposed bonds); or

 (2) a certificate of both the Director of Finance and the Superintendent of the Municipal Water System (or any officer who succeeds to substantially all of the responsibilities of either office) that in their opinion the Adjusted Net Revenue for the five fiscal years next following the earlier of (i) the end of the period during which interest on those Future Parity Bonds is to be capitalized or, if no interest is capitalized, the fiscal year in which the Future Parity Bonds are issued, or (ii) the date on which substantially all new facilities financed with those Future Parity Bonds are expected to commence operations, such Adjusted Net Revenue further adjusted as provided in paragraphs (i) through (iv) below, will be at least equal to the Coverage Requirement. That certificate may take into account the following adjustments:

 (i) Any changes in rates in effect and being charged, or rates expected to be charged in accordance with a program of specific rates, rate levels or increases in overall rate revenue approved by ordinance or resolution;

 (ii) Net revenue from customers of the Municipal Water System who have become customers during the twelve (12) consecutive month period or thereafter, and their estimate of net revenue from any customers to be connected to the Municipal Water System who have paid the required connection charges, adjusted to reflect one year's net revenue from those customers;

 (iii) Their estimate of net revenue from customers anticipated to be served by facilities or improvements financed in substantial part by those Future Parity Bonds (or additional Parity Bonds expected to be issued during the five-year period); and

 (iv) Net revenue from any person, firm, corporation or municipal corporation under any executed contract for water or other utility service, which revenue was not included in the historical Net Revenue of the Municipal Water System.

 If the Future Parity Bonds proposed to be issued are for the sole purpose of refunding outstanding bonds payable from the Bond Account, no such coverage certification shall be required if the Adjusted Annual Debt Service on the Parity Bonds after the issuance of the Future Parity Bonds is not, for any year in which the Parity Bonds being refunded were outstanding, more than five thousand dollars ($5,000) over the Adjusted Annual Debt Service on the Parity Bonds prior to the issuance of those Future Parity Bonds.

 Nothing contained herein shall prevent the City from issuing Future Parity Bonds to refund maturing Parity Bonds, money for the payment of which is not otherwise available.

 Section 16. Reimbursement Obligations

 . If the City elects to meet any Series Reserve Requirement or any portion thereof through the use of Reserve Insurance or elects to secure any issue of Parity Bonds through the use of Bond Insurance, the City may contract with the entity providing such Reserve Insurance or Bond Insurance to the effect that the City's reimbursement obligation, if any, to such entity ranks on a parity of lien with the Parity Bonds.

 If provided by the Bond Sale Resolution or an ordinance or resolution providing for the issuance or the terms, conditions and covenants of Future Parity Bonds, if the principal of, interest or mandatory redemption requirements due on the Bonds is paid by a Bond Insurer pursuant to a Bond Insurance policy, the Bonds shall not be considered paid by the City, and the covenants, agreements and other obligations of the City to the registered owners shall continue to exist and the Bond Insurer shall be subrogated to the rights of the registered owners.

 Section 17. Separate Utility Systems

 . The City may create, acquire, construct, finance, own and operate one or more additional systems for water supply, transmission or other commodity or service. The revenue of that separate utility system shall not be included in the Gross Revenue of the Municipal Water System and may be pledged to the payment of revenue obligations issued to purchase, construct, condemn or otherwise acquire or expand the separate utility system. Neither the Gross Revenue nor the Net Revenue of the Municipal Water System shall be pledged by the City to the payment of any obligations of a separate utility system except (1) as a Contract Resource Obligation upon compliance with Section 27 of Ordinance 116705 or Section 18 hereof and/or (2) with respect to the Net Revenue, on a basis subordinate to the lien of the Prior Lien Bonds and the Parity Bonds on that Net Revenue.

 Section 18. Contract Resource Obligations

 . The City may at any time enter into one or more Contract Resource Obligations for the acquisition, from facilities to be constructed, of water supply, transmission or other commodity or service relating to the Municipal Water System. The City may determine that, and may agree under a Contract Resource Obligation to provide that, all payments under that Contract Resource Obligation (including payments prior to the time that water supply or transmission or other commodity or service is being provided, or during a suspension or after termination of supply or service) shall be Operation and Maintenance Expenses if the following requirements are met at the time such a Contract Resource Obligation is entered into:

 (a) No Event of Default as defined in Section 25 of this ordinance has occurred and is continuing.

 (b) There shall be on file a certificate of an Independent Consulting Engineer stating that (i) the payments to be made by the City in connection with the Contract Resource Obligation are reasonable for the supply or transmission rendered; (ii) the source of any new supply, and any facilities to be constructed to provide the supply or transmission, are sound from a water or other commodity supply or transmission planning standpoint, are technically and economically feasible in accordance with prudent utility practice, and are likely to provide supply or transmission no later than a date set forth in the Independent Consulting Engineer's certification; and (iii) the Adjusted Net Revenue (further adjusted by the Independent Consulting Engineer's estimate of the payments to be made in accordance with the Contract Resource Obligation) for the five fiscal years following the year in which the Contract Resource Obligation is incurred, as such Adjusted Net Revenue is estimated by the Independent Consulting Engineer in accordance with the provisions of and adjustments permitted in Section 15(e)(2) hereof, will be at least equal to the Coverage Requirement.

 Payments required to be made under Contract Resource Obligations shall not be subject to acceleration.

 Nothing in this Section 18 shall be deemed to prevent the City from entering into other agreements for the acquisition of water supply, transmission or other commodity or service from existing facilities and from treating those payments as Operation and Maintenance Expenses. Nothing in this Section 18 shall be deemed to prevent the City from entering into other agreements for the acquisition of water supply, transmission or other commodity or service from facilities to be constructed and from agreeing to make payments with respect thereto, such payments constituting a lien and charge on Net Revenue subordinate to that of Parity Bonds.

 Section 19. Preservation of Tax Exemption for Interest on Bonds

 . The City covenants that it will take all actions, consistent with the terms of the Bonds, this ordinance and the Bond Sale Resolution, reasonably within its power and necessary to prevent interest on the Bonds from being included in gross income for federal income tax purposes, and the City will neither take any action nor make or permit any use of proceeds of the Bonds or other funds of the City treated as proceeds of the Bonds at any time during the term of the Bonds which will cause interest on the Bonds to be included in gross income for federal income tax purposes.

 The City has not been notified of any listing or proposed listing by the Internal Revenue Service to the effect that the City is a bond issuer the arbitrage certifications of which may not be relied upon.

 Section 20. Advance Refunding or Defeasance of Bonds

 . The City may issue advance refunding bonds pursuant to the laws of the State or use money available from any other lawful source to pay the principal of, interest and premium, if any, on the Bonds, or such portion thereof included in a refunding or defeasance plan, as the same become due and payable and to redeem and retire, release, refund or defease the Bonds (the "defeased Bonds") and to pay the costs of such refunding or defeasance. In the event that money and/or Government Obligations sufficient in amount, together with known earned income from the investments thereof, to redeem and retire, release, refund or defease the defeased Bonds in accordance with their terms, are set aside irrevocably in a special fund for and pledged irrevocably to such redemption, retirement or defeasance (the "trust account"), then all right and interest of the owners of the defeased Bonds in the covenants of this ordinance and in the Net Revenue and the funds and accounts pledged to the payment of such defeased Bonds, other than the right to receive the funds so set aside and pledged, thereafter shall cease and become void. Such owners thereafter shall have the right to receive payment of the principal of and interest or redemption price on the defeased Bonds from the trust account.

 After the establishing and full funding of such a trust account, the City then may apply any money in any other fund or account established for the payment or redemption of the defeased Bonds to any lawful purposes as it shall determine, subject only to the rights of the owners of any other Parity Bonds.

 If the refunding plan provides that the defeased Bonds to be issued be secured by money and/or Government Obligations pending the prior redemption of the defeased Bonds and if such refunding plan also provides that certain money and/or Government Obligations are pledged irrevocably for the prior redemption of the defeased Bonds included in that refunding plan, then only the debt service on the Bonds which are not defeased Bonds and the refunding bonds, the payment of which is not so secured by the refunding plan, shall be included in the computation of the Coverage Requirement for the issuance of Future Parity Bonds and the annual computation of the Coverage Requirement for determining compliance with the rate covenants.

 Section 21. Sale of Bonds

 . The Director of Finance may provide for the sale of the Bonds in one or more series by a negotiated sale or sales with the underwriters chosen through a selection process acceptable to the Director of Finance (the "Purchasers"). The terms of that sale shall be consistent with this ordinance and confirmed by the Bond Sale Resolution. The Bonds will be delivered to the Purchasers in New York, New York, within sixty (60) days after the sale date and immediately upon payment to the City of the purchase price plus accrued interest to the date of closing in immediately available federal funds in Seattle, Washington, at the City's expense or at another time or place upon which the Director of Finance and the Purchasers may mutually agree at the Purchasers' expense.

 CUSIP numbers will be printed on the Bonds, but neither failure to print CUSIP numbers on any Bond nor error with respect thereto shall constitute cause for a failure or refusal by the Purchasers to accept delivery of and pay for the Bonds in accordance with the purchase offer. All expenses in relation to the printing of CUSIP numbers on the Bonds shall be paid by the City, but the fee of the CUSIP Service Bureau for the assignment of those numbers shall be the responsibility of and shall be paid by the Purchasers.

 The City will cause the Bonds to be typed, photocopied, printed or lithographed, sealed and executed and will furnish the approving legal opinion of Bond Counsel, the opinion also being printed on each Bond unless the Bond is typed or photocopied.

 Section 22. Temporary Bond

 . Pending the printing, execution and delivery to the Purchasers of the definitive Bonds, the City may cause to be executed and delivered to the Purchasers a single temporary Bond in the total principal amount of the Bonds. The temporary Bond shall bear the same date of issuance, interest rates, principal payment dates and terms and covenants as the definitive Bonds, shall be issued as a fully registered Bond in the name of the Purchasers, and shall be in such form as acceptable to the Purchasers. Such temporary Bond shall be exchanged for the definitive Bonds as soon as the same are printed, executed and available for delivery.

 Section 23. Amendatory and Supplemental Ordinances

 .

 (a) This ordinance shall not be modified or amended in any respect subsequent to the initial issuance of the Bonds, except as provided in and in accordance with and subject to the provisions of this Section 23.

 (b) The City, from time to time, and at any time, without the consent of or notice to the registered owners of the Bonds, may pass supplemental or amendatory ordinances or supplements or amendments to the Bond Sale Resolution, as follows:

 (1) To cure any formal defect, omission, inconsistency or ambiguity in this ordinance in a manner not adverse to the owner of any Parity Bond;

 (2) To impose upon the Bond Registrar (with its consent) for the benefit of the registered owners of the Bonds any additional rights, remedies, powers, authority, security, liabilities or duties which may lawfully be granted, conferred or imposed and which are not contrary to or inconsistent with this ordinance as theretofore in effect;

 (3) To add to the covenants and agreements of, and limitations and restrictions upon, the City in this ordinance, other covenants, agreements, limitations and restrictions to be observed by the City which are not contrary or inconsistent with this ordinance as theretofore in effect;

 (4) To confirm, as further assurance, any pledge under, and the subjection to any claim, lien or pledge created or to be created by this ordinance of any other money, securities or funds;

 (6) To modify, alter, amend or supplement this ordinance in any other respect which is not materially adverse to the registered owners of the Parity Bonds and which does not involve a change described in paragraph (c) of this Section 23;

 (7) Because of change in federal law or rulings, to maintain the exclusion from gross income of the interest on the Bonds from federal income taxation; and

 (8) To add to the covenants and agreements of, and limitations and restrictions upon, the City in this ordinance, other covenants, agreements, limitations and restrictions to be observed by the City which are requested by a Bond Insurer or provider of Reserve Insurance and which are not materially adverse to the registered owners of the Parity Bonds.

 Before the City shall adopt any such supplemental ordinance pursuant to this subsection, there shall have been delivered to the City and the Bond Registrar an opinion of Bond Counsel, stating that such supplemental ordinance is authorized or permitted by this ordinance and, upon the execution and delivery thereof, will be valid and binding upon the City in accordance with its terms and will not adversely affect the exclusion from gross income for federal income tax purposes of interest on the Bonds.

 (c) (1) Except for any supplemental ordinance entered into pursuant to paragraph (b) of this Section 23, subject to the terms and provisions contained in this paragraph (c) and not otherwise, registered owners of not less than sixty percent (60%) in aggregate principal amount of the Parity Bonds shall have the right from time to time to consent to and approve the passage by the City of any supplemental ordinance deemed necessary or desirable by the City for the purpose of modifying, altering, amending, supplementing or rescinding, in any particular, any of the terms or provisions contained in this ordinance; except that, unless approved in writing by the registered owners of all Parity Bonds, nothing contained in this section shall permit, or be construed as permitting:

 (i) A change in the times, amounts or currency of payment of the principal of or interest on any outstanding Parity Bond, or a reduction in the principal amount or redemption price of any outstanding Parity Bond or a change in the redemption price of any outstanding Parity Bond or a change in the method of determining the rate of interest thereon, or

 (ii) A preference of priority of any Parity Bond or Bonds or any other bond or bonds, or

 (iii) A reduction in the aggregate principal amount of Parity Bonds, the consent of the registered owners of Parity Bonds of which is required for any such supplemental ordinance.

 (2) If at any time the City shall pass any supplemental ordinance for any of the purposes of this subsection (c), the Bond Registrar shall cause notice of the proposed supplemental ordinance to be given by first-class United States mail to all registered owners of the Parity Bonds, to any Bond Insurer, and to the Rating Agencies if the Bonds are rated by those agencies. Such notice shall briefly set forth the nature of the proposed supplemental ordinance and shall state that a copy thereof is on file at the office of the Bond Registrar for inspection by all registered owners of the Parity Bonds.

 (3) Within two years after the date of the mailing of such notice, the City may adopt such supplemental ordinance in substantially the form described in such notice, but only if there shall have first been delivered to the Bond Registrar (i) the required consents, in writing, of the registered owners of the Parity Bonds, and (ii) an opinion of bond counsel stating that such supplemental ordinance is authorized or permitted by this ordinance and, upon the execution and delivery thereof, will be valid and binding upon the City in accordance with its terms and will not adversely affect the exclusion from gross income for federal income tax purposes of interest on the Parity Bonds.

 (4) If registered owners of not less than the percentage of Parity Bonds required by this paragraph (c) shall have consented to and approved the execution and delivery thereof as herein provided, no owner of the Parity Bonds shall have any right to object to the passage of such supplemental ordinance, or to object to any of the terms and provisions contained therein or the operation thereof, or in any manner to question the propriety of the passage thereof, or to enjoin or restrain the City or the Bond Registrar from passing the same or from taking any action pursuant to the provisions thereof.

 (d) Upon the execution and delivery of any supplemental ordinance pursuant to the provisions of this Section 23, this ordinance shall be, and be deemed to be, modified and amended in accordance therewith, and the respective rights, duties and obligations under this ordinance of the City, the Bond Registrar and all registered owners of Parity Bonds, shall thereafter be determined, exercised and enforced under this ordinance subject in all respects to such modifications and amendments.

 Section 24. Defaults and Remedies

 .

 24.1 Events of Default. The following shall constitute "Events of Default" with respect to the Bonds:

 (1) If a default is made in the payment of the principal of or interest on any of the Bonds when the same shall become due and payable; or

 (2) If the City defaults in the observance and performance of any other of the covenants, conditions and agreements on the part of the City set forth in Sections 13(b), (c), (d) and (h), 14, 15 and 19 of this ordinance and such default or defaults have continued for a period of six months after they have received from the Bondowners' Trustee (as defined below) or from the registered owners of not less than twenty-five percent (25%) in principal amount of the Parity Bonds, a written notice specifying and demanding the cure of such default. However, if the default in the observance and performance of any other of the covenants, conditions and agreements is one which cannot be completely remedied within the six (6) months after written notice has been given, it shall not be an Event of Default with respect to the Bonds as long as the City has taken active steps within the six (6) months after written notice has been given to remedy the default and is diligently pursuing such remedy.

 (3) If the City files a petition in bankruptcy or is placed in receivership under any state or federal bankruptcy or insolvency law.

 24.2 Bondowners' Trustee. So long as such Event of Default has not been remedied, a bondowners' trustee (the "Bondowners' Trustee") may be appointed by the registered owners of twenty-five percent (25%) in principal amount of the Parity Bonds, by an instrument or concurrent instruments in writing signed and acknowledged by such registered owners of the Parity Bonds or by their attorneys-in-fact duly authorized and delivered to such Bondowners' Trustee, notification thereof being given to the City. That appointment shall become effective immediately upon acceptance thereof by the Bondowners' Trustee. Any Bondowners' Trustee appointed under the provisions of this Subsection 24.2 shall be a bank or trust company organized under the laws of the State of Washington or the State of New York or a national banking association. The bank or trust company acting as Bondowners' Trustee may be removed at any time, and a successor Bondowners' Trustee may be appointed, by the registered owners of a majority in principal amount of the Parity Bonds, by an instrument or concurrent instruments in writing signed and acknowledged by such registered owners of the Bonds or by their attorneys-in-fact duly authorized. The Bondowners' Trustee may require such security and indemnity as may be reasonable against the costs, expenses and liabilities that may be incurred in the performance of its duties.

 In the event that any Event of Default in the sole judgment of the Bondowners' Trustee is cured and the Bondowners' Trustee furnishes to the City a certificate so stating, that Event of Default shall be conclusively deemed to be cured and the City, the Bondowners' Trustee and the registered owners of the Parity Bonds shall be restored to the same rights and position which they would have held if no Event of Default had occurred.

 The Bondowners' Trustee appointed in the manner herein provided, and each successor thereto, is declared to be a trustee for the registered owners of all the Parity Bonds and is empowered to exercise all the rights and powers herein conferred on the Bondowners' Trustee.

 24.3 Suits at Law or in Equity. Upon the happening of an Event of Default and during the continuance thereof, the Bondowners' Trustee may, and upon the written request of the registered owners of not less then twenty-five percent (25%) in principal amount of the Parity Bonds outstanding shall, take such steps and institute such suits, actions or other proceedings, all as it may deem appropriate for the protection and enforcement of the rights of the registered owners of the Parity Bonds, to collect any amounts due and owing to or from the City, or to obtain other appropriate relief, and may enforce the specific performance of any covenant, agreement or condition contained in this ordinance or in any of the Parity Bonds.

 Nothing contained in this Section 24 shall, in any event or under any circumstance, be deemed to authorize the acceleration of maturity of principal on the Parity Bonds, and the remedy of acceleration is expressly denied to the registered owners of the Parity Bonds under any circumstances including, without limitation, upon the occurrence and continuance of an Event of Default.

 Any action, suit or other proceedings instituted by the Bondowners' Trustee hereunder shall be brought in its name as trustee for the Bondowners and all such rights of action upon or under any of the Parity Bonds or the provisions of this ordinance may be enforced by the Bondowners' Trustee without the possession of any of those Parity Bonds and without the production of the same at any trial or proceedings relative thereto except where otherwise required by law. Any such suit, action or proceeding instituted by the Bondowners' Trustee shall be brought for the ratable benefit of all of the registered owners of those Parity Bonds, subject to the provisions of this ordinance. The respective registered owners of the Parity Bonds, by taking and holding the same, shall be conclusively deemed irrevocably to appoint the Bondowners' Trustee the true and lawful trustee of the respective registered owners of those Parity Bonds, with authority to institute any such action, suit or proceeding; to receive as trustee and deposit in trust any sums becoming distributable on account of those Parity Bonds; to execute any paper or documents for the receipt of money; and to do all acts with respect thereto that the registered owner himself or herself might have done in person. Nothing herein shall be deemed to authorize or empower the Bondowners' Trustee to consent to accept or adopt, on behalf of any registered owner of the Parity Bonds, any plan of reorganization or adjustment affecting the Parity Bonds or any right of any registered owner thereof, or to authorize or empower the Bondowners' Trustee to vote the claims of the registered owners thereof in any receivership, insolvency, liquidation, bankruptcy, reorganization or other proceeding to which the City is a party.

 24.4 Application of Money Collected by Bondowners' Trustee. Any money collected by the Bondowners' Trustee at any time pursuant to this Section 24 shall be applied in the following order of priority:

 (i) first, to the payment of the charges, expenses, advances and compensation of the Bondowners' Trustee and the charges, expenses, counsel fees, disbursements and compensation of its agents and attorneys; and

 (ii) second, to the payment to the persons entitled thereto of all installments of interest then due first on any Prior Lien Bonds and then on the Parity Bonds in the order of maturity of such installments and, if the amount available shall not be sufficient to pay in full any installment or installments maturing on the same date, then to the payment thereof ratably, according to the amounts due thereon to the persons entitled thereto, without any discrimination or preference; and

 (iii) third, to the payment to the persons entitled thereto of the unpaid principal amounts first on any Prior Lien Bonds and then on any Parity Bonds which shall have become due (other than Prior Lien Bonds and Parity Bonds previously called for redemption for the payment of which money is held pursuant to the provisions hereto), whether at maturity or by proceedings for redemption or otherwise, in the order of their due dates and, if the amount available shall not be sufficient to pay in full the principal amounts due on the same date, then to the payment thereof ratably, according to the principal amounts due thereon to the persons entitled thereto, without any discrimination or preference.

 24.5 Duties and Obligations of Bondowners' Trustee. The Bondowners' Trustee shall not be liable except for the performance of such duties as are specifically set forth herein. During an Event of Default, the Bondowners' Trustee shall exercise such of the rights and powers vested in it hereby, and shall use the same degree of care and skill in its exercise, as a prudent person would exercise or use under the circumstances in the conduct of his or her own affairs. The Bondowners' Trustee shall have no liability for any act or omission to act hereunder except for the Bondowners' Trustee's own negligent action, its own negligent failure to act or its own willful misconduct. The duties and obligations of the Bondowners' Trustee shall be determined solely by the express provisions of this ordinance, and no implied powers, duties or obligations of the Bondowners' Trustee shall be read into this ordinance.

 The Bondowners' Trustee shall not be required to expend or risk its own funds or otherwise incur individual liability in the performance of any of its duties or in the exercise of any of its rights or powers as the Bondowners' Trustee, except as may result from its own negligent action, its own negligent failure to act or its own willful misconduct.

 The Bondowners' Trustee shall not be bound to recognize any person as a registered owner of any Bond until his title thereto, if disputed, has been established to its reasonable satisfaction.

 The Bondowners' Trustee may consult with counsel and the opinion of such counsel shall be full and complete authorization and protection in respect of any action taken or suffered by it hereunder in good faith and in accordance with the opinion of such counsel. The Bondowners' Trustee shall not be answerable for any neglect or default of any person, firm or corporation employed and selected-by it with reasonable care.

 24.6 Suits by Individual Bondowners Restricted. Neither the registered owner nor the beneficial owner of any one or more of Parity Bonds shall have any right to institute any action, suit or proceeding at law or in equity for the enforcement of same unless:

 (i) an Event of Default has happened and is continuing; and

 (ii) a Bondowners' Trustee has been appointed; and

 (iii) such owner previously shall have given to the Bondowners' Trustee written notice of the Event of Default on account of which such suit, action or proceeding is to be instituted; and

 (iv) the registered owners of twenty-five percent (25%) in principal amount of the Parity Bonds, after the occurrence of such Event of Default, has made written request of the Bondowners' Trustee and have afforded the Bondowners' Trustee a reasonable opportunity to institute such suit, action or proceeding; and

 (v) there have been offered to the Bondowners' Trustee security and indemnity satisfactory to it against the costs, expenses and liabilities to be incurred therein or thereby; and

 (vi) the Bondowners' Trustee has refused or neglected to comply with such request within a reasonable time.

 No registered owner or beneficial owner of any Parity Bond shall have any right in any manner whatever by his action to affect or impair the obligation of the City to pay from the Net Revenue the principal of and interest on such Parity Bonds to the respective owners thereof when due.

 Section 25. General Authorization
