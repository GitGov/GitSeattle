 Section 1. Chapter 4.20 of the Seattle Municipal Code is hereby amended by adding a new Section 4.20.375 thereto, to read as follows:

 4.20.375 Parking of Privately-Owned Motor Vehicles by Councilmembers

 A. Seattle City Councilmembers who choose to park privately-owned motor vehicles in the Municipal Building garage, or in any other City- owned parking facilities in which other City officers or employees must pay for the parking of such vehicles, shall pay for such parking.

 Rates for such Councilmember parking shall be established by the Executive Services Director pursuant to Seattle Municipal Code Subsection 3.24.040(I), and shall be established in an amount that is consistent with fees charged to other City officers and employees for comparable parking privileges. City Councilmembers also shall be eligible for other types of parking permits, including but not limited to carpool parking permits, on the same terms and pursuant to the same rates as are applicable to other City officers and employees; and may request the issuance of occasional City-paid one-day parking passes, on the same basis as those are available to other City officers and employees, when it is necessary to park privately-owned motor vehicles in such garage or facilities for purposes that are solely related to City business. City Councilmembers also are eligible to use City motor-pool vehicles pursuant to Seattle Municipal Code Section 3.18.140.

 B. City Council positions 1, 3, 5, 7 and 9 shall become subject to subsection A of this section at the time of commencement of the next term of office in January, 2000. All other City Council positions shall become subject to subsection A of this section at the time of commencement of the next term of office in January, 2002. Nothing in this section shall be construed so as to prevent City Councilmembers from voluntarily paying for parking privileges in the Municipal Building garage or other City-owned parking facilities in which other City officers or employees must pay for the parking of privately-owned motor vehicles prior to such effective dates, and the Executive Services Director shall be authorized to collect such voluntary payments prior to such effective dates, and to establish a payroll check-off or deduction system to facilitate such collection.

 Section 2. This ordinance shall take effect and be in force thirty (30) days from and after its approval by the Mayor, but if not approved and returned by the Mayor within ten (10) days after presentation, it shall take effect as provided by Municipal Code Section 1.04.020.
