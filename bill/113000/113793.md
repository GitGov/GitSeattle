 AN ORDINANCE relating to the Seattle Design Commission, amending Section 3.58.040 and 3.58.080 of the Seattle Municipal Code to revise the term of office and eligibility requirements for Commission members, and their advisory duties.

 WHEREAS, the Seattle Design Commission was established October 1, 1968 to act in a consulting capacity, advising the Mayor, City Council, department staff and consultants on environmental and design aspects of City capital improvement projects;

 WHEREAS, the Seattle Design Commission is the only group that reviews capital improvement projects from all City departments, and therefore is in a unique position to advise and comment on major trends and key issues that affect the city;

 WHEREAS, the professional, multidisciplinary expertise offered by the Design Commission helps ensure that the citizens of Seattle receive the highest level of design excellence and livability possible in public facilities and within the civic environment;

 WHEREAS, the Design Commission serves as an impartial and balanced venue for an open discussion of the issues that arise in the context of city development;

 WHEREAS, the Design Commission members serve on consultant selection panels, offering their professional experience to the selection process;

 WHEREAS, the Design Commission members provide the City with invaluable expertise, knowledge and skills that help to ensure the most efficient use of limited public resources;

 WHEREAS, the Design Commissioners currently operate under both the general conflict of interest provision that all City "officers" must comply with, and a much more restrictive provision included in Section 3.58.040 that applies only to the Design Commission members, as well as to their employers;

 WHEREAS, in recent years the Design Commission has found it increasingly difficult to find members of the design community, and their employers, who are able to meet the eligibility limitations related to conflict of interest and therefore be willing to serve on the Design Commission;
