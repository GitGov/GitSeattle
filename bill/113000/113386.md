 ORDINANCE __________

 AN ORDINANCE authorizing the City of Seattle to develop a plan for integrated in-city transit service, including monorail, trolleys, light rail, enhanced bus service, guided bus-ways, a van system, and other systems where appropriate; authorizing an appropriation of $2,000,000 to develop such an integrated in-city transit service plan as an alternative to the monorail-only plan proposed in Initiative Measure No. 53; requiring the City to seek authority necessary to finance, build, and operate such an integrated in-city transit system; and submitting this alternative measure to a vote of the qualified electors of the City at the election to be held on November 7, 2000.

 WHEREAS, the qualified electors of the City of Seattle approved Initiative Measure No. 41 on November 4, 1997, creating a public corporation called the Elevated Transportation Company ("ETC"); and

 WHEREAS, Initiative 41 chartered the ETC to build, maintain, and operate a 40-mile electrically powered, rubber tired and principally elevated mass transportation system along specified routes and with the locations of many stations specified; and

 WHEREAS, Initiative 41 provided that the ETC should attempt to locate private funding to carry out its goal of building the monorail system described in the initiative; and

 WHEREAS, the ETC was unable to locate any significant private funding to advance the monorail system proposed in Initiative 41; and

 WHEREAS, City funds would be required to pay most of the construction and finance costs of a 40-mile citywide monorail system; and

 WHEREAS, the City Council enacted Ordinance 120049, which amended Initiative 41, dissolved the Elevated Transportation Company as a public corporation and formed an advisory committee called the Elevated Transportation Committee; and

 WHEREAS, proponents circulated petitions for Initiative Measure No. 53, which also concerns the planning, funding and possible construction of a monorail system; and

 WHEREAS, the King County Division of Records and Elections certified on September 13, 2000 that the petitions bore a sufficient number of valid signatures to qualify the proposed initiative for enactment by the City Council or for submission to the qualified electors of the City of Seattle for their approval or rejection (C.F.No. 304012); and

 WHEREAS, the City Council may, pursuant to City Charter Article IV, Section 1.D, submit Initiative 53 to a vote of the qualified electors of the City of Seattle; and

 WHEREAS, the City Council may also, pursuant to City Charter Article IV, Section 1.D, submit an alternative measure dealing with the same subject as Initiative Measure No. 53 to a vote of the qualified electors of the City of Seattle; and

 WHEREAS, the ballot title for Initiative Measure No. 53 reads as follows:

 The City of Seattle Initiative Measure No. 53 concerns the planning,

 funding and possible construction of a monorail system.

 This measure would require the City to provide $6,000,000 to fund operation of the Elevated Transportation Company, including preparation of a monorail funding and construction plan. The measure outlines required elements of the plan, which would be implemented if approved by voters. The City also would be required to reserve up to $200 million in councilmanic bonding capacity, to be used for monorail construction if voters approved the plan. A transit authority would supervise system construction and operation.

 WHEREAS, notwithstanding Initiative Measure Nos. 41 and 53, changes in state law would be required in order for the City of Seattle to build and operate an in-city transit system; and

 WHEREAS, the voters of the City of Seattle should be informed of the full cost of building an in-city transit system and of the necessity for new taxes to construct and operate such a system; and,

 WHEREAS, a fully integrated in-city transit system could include many transportation choices, such as monorail, trolleys, light rail, enhanced bus service, guided bus-ways, a van system, and other transit modes where appropriate;

 NOW THEREFORE, BE IT ORDAINED BY THE CITY OF SEATTLE AS FOLLOWS:

 Section 1. Statement of Legislative findings.

 1. State law currently restricts the authority of the City of Seattle to operate a transit system, even if voters approve Initiative Measure No. 53.

 2. The City's councilmanic debt capacity is insufficient to reserve $200,000,000 for monorail construction, as called for in Initiative Measure No. 53, and still carry out other anticipated capital projects;

 3. Additional city taxes and voter-approved bonds to pay for construction and operation of an in-city elevated transit system would be required to build and operate such a system.

 4. The City Council recognizes that this ordinance is a different measure dealing with the same subject as and conflicting with Initiative Measure No. 53, as those terms are used in City Charter Article IV, Sections 1.D and 1.G, and that therefore this measure should, pursuant to those sections of the Charter, be submitted to the qualified electors of the City of Seattle for their consideration on the same ballot with Initiative Measure No. 53.

 Section 2. The City of Seattle is authorized to develop a plan, including a financing plan and a neighborhood acceptance process, for an in-city transit service system, integrating monorail, trolleys, light rail, enhanced bus service, guided bus-ways, a van system, and other transit technologies where appropriate;

 Section 3. The City is authorized to appropriate up to $2,000,000 to the Strategic Planning Office in the 2001 budget to develop the integrated transit plan described in Section 2. No City funds shall be appropriated to finance the monorail-only plan described in Initiative No. 53. The Elevated Transit Committee shall have only the advisory role described in Ordinance No. 120049.

 Section 4. The City shall seek authority necessary to construct and operate such an in-city transit system, including authorization for the necessary new tax or taxes, and will then submit such tax proposals to the qualified electors of Seattle for their approval.

 Section 5. This ordinance in a different measure dealing with the same subject and conflicting with Initiative Measure No. 53, as those terms are used in City Charter Article IV, Sections 1.D and 1.G. This ordinance should therefore be submitted to the qualified electors of the City of Seattle for their consideration on the same ballot with Initiative Measure No. 53. This ordinance is hereby referred to a vote of the qualified electors of the City at the special city election being held in conjunction with the general election to be held on November 7, 2000.

 Section 6. Ballot Measure. The King County Director of Records and Elections, as ex officio supervisor of elections, is hereby requested, in conjunction with the state general election on November 7, 2000, to submit this alternative ballot measure to the qualified electors of the City. The City Clerk is hereby authorized to take those actions necessary to submit, pursuant to City Charter Article IV, Section 1.D, this alternative ballot measure to the qualified electors of the City of Seattle for their approval or rejection at the special municipal election to be held in conjunction with the November 7, 2000 state general election. The Executive Director of the Ethics and Elections Commission is authorized to take the steps necessary to produce a voters' pamphlet for the election, including for this alternative measure.

 Section 7. Ballot Title and Explanatory Statement. The City Attorney shall prepare the ballot title and explanatory statement for this alternative measure as provided by applicable law.

 Section 8. Effective Dates. Sections 1, 2, 3, and 4 of this ordinance shall go into effect only if this alternative measure is approved by the qualified electors of the City of Seattle, and if both this conflicting alternative measure and Initiative Measure No. 53 should both be approved, Sections 1, 2, 3, and 4 of this ordinance shall go into effect only if this alternative measure receives a greater number of affirmative votes than does Initiative Measure No. 53.

 Section 9. Except as provided in Section 8, this ordinance shall take effect and be in force immediately upon the ordinance's approval by the Mayor or, if is not approved and returned by the Mayor within ten (10) days after presentation, then on the eleventh (11th) day after its presentation to the Mayor or, if vetoed by the Mayor, then immediately after its passage over his veto.
