 AN ORDINANCE relating to the City Light Department; amending Seattle Municipal Code chapter 21.49 by adding sections establishing a net metering program and a rate class for new large loads, and by eliminating the minimum charge for customers served under Schedules MDC, MDS and MDD.

 WHEREAS, the City expects to implement a new customer information and billing system for the Department early in 2001; and

 WHEREAS, applying a minimum charge to customers served under Schedules MDC, MDS and MDD is not compatible with the capabilities of the new billing system; and

 WHEREAS, new and existing customers have notified the Department that they intend to increase their consumption of electricity by more than 10 average MW over a period of 24 months or less and have requested service at this higher level; and

 WHEREAS, the incremental cost of supplying electricity to these customers is likely to be considerably above the average cost of service to existing customers at current levels of consumption; and

 WHEREAS, including such incremental costs in the revenue requirements that serve as the basis for setting rates for all customers would result in higher rates for all customers; and

 WHEREAS, the Pacific Northwest Power Planning and Conservation Act requires the Bonneville Power Administration to set higher prices for electricity provided to customers whose consumption of electricity increases by more than 10 average MW over any consecutive twelve-month period; and

 WHEREAS, chapter 80.60 of the Revised Code of Washington requires electric utilities to make available a net metering program under which eligible customers may generate electricity for their own use, and feed back any excess to and purchase any deficit from the customer's electric utility; and

 WHEREAS, the City of Seattle supports the development of new renewable energy technologies, which allow its customers to move in a sustainable way toward a clean and more diverse energy future; and

 WHEREAS, a net metering program is expected to stimulate the use and development of new renewable technologies, create environmental benefits to the community and provide an opportunity for the Seattle City Light Department to improve its understanding of how to manage such resources within its electrical system; and

 WHEREAS, the Seattle City Light Department has reviewed public safety and system reliability issues in connection with implementation of a net metering program in areas served by an underground distribution network (as such term is defined in SMC 21.49.090), and has presented its findings to the City Council; and

 WHEREAS, the City Council has provided appropriate notice and opportunity for public comment on such issues; and

 WHEREAS, based on the information presented to it and in accordance with RCW chapter 80.60, the City Council finds and determines that (a) protective equipment in a Seattle City Light Department underground distribution network is designed for the one-way flow of power, and that such protective equipment can fail explosively if used with two- way power flow, as will occur in a net metering program, (b) in an underground distribution network, reverse power flow from a customer participating in a net metering program (as hereinafter defined) to an underground distribution network may cause protective equipment to open and can de-energize the customer's service, and (c) because of such potential negative effects on public safety and system reliability, the Seattle City Light Department net metering program, as herein defined and authorized, shall not be available to customers served by an underground distribution network; NOW, THEREFORE,

 BE IT ORDAINED BY THE CITY OF SEATTLE AS FOLLOWS:

 Section 1. Subsection 21.49.020.A of the Seattle Municipal Code, is amended as follows to add three new definitions, "net metering program," "net metering system," and "new large load," which will be numbered 20, 21 and 22 respectively, and to renumber current definitions 20 through 27 accordingly:

 SMC 21.49.020 Definitions.

 A. The following terms or abbreviations, as used in this chapter, have the following meanings:

 ***

20. "Net metering program" means a Department program under which eligible customers that operate net metering systems may generate electricity for their own use, sell the excess to the Department and purchase any deficit from the Department.  21. "Net metering system" means a fuel cell or a facility for the production of electrical energy that uses as its fuel either solar, wind, or hydropower; has a generating capacity of not more than twenty-five kilowatts; is located on the customer's premises; operates in parallel with the electric utility's transmission and distribution facilities; and is intended to offset part or all of that customer's requirements for electricity.

 22. "New Large Load" means any service fed from an expanded or a new installation equal to or greater than 12.5 MVA of energized capacity installed within any consecutive 5-year period after August 31, 2000. Installed capacity may be a measure of either dedicated feeder or transformer capacity, with the following qualifications:  a. The measure of energized installed transformer capacity excludes any redundant transformer capacity required in a network area.

 b. Also excluded from the measure of energized installed transformer capacity is any redundant capacity paid for by the customer, that is installed for the purpose of obtaining enhanced reliability.

 c. When the energized installed capacity is a measure of dedicated feeder capacity, the installation shall not be considered a New Large Load until such time as the consumption is confirmed to be equal to or greater than 10 annual average MW. The installation shall then be back-billed on Schedule VRC, on a true-up basis, from the beginning of the twelve-month period when the rolling average consumption equals or exceeds 10 annual average MW. Customers anticipating becoming a New Large Load have the option of earlier proposing a tailored delivery package pursuant to Section 21.49.059 (C).

 d. Where a present customer relocates their existing service within the Department's service area, the customer's previous load shall be considered to be transferred, establishing the baseline from which increases will be measured.

 Section 2. Subsection 21.49.055 of the Seattle Municipal Code, is amended as follows to add a new subsection E.

 Section 21.49.055 Medium general service (Schedules MDC, MDS and MDD).

 ***

E. When the City's new customer information and billing system is implemented, minimum charges shall no longer apply to customers served under Schedules MDC, MDS and MDD.

 ***

 Section 3. A new section 21.49.059 is added to the Seattle Municipal Code, to read as follows:

21.49.59 New Large Load general service (Schedule NLL)  A. New Large Load general service is general service provided to a New Large Load.

 1. The NLL rate shall not apply to individually metered services served from the installed capacity of a New Large Load customer when such individually metered service is a:

 a. residential service individually metered and billed by the Department ; or

 b. retail space individually metered and billed by the Department.

 2. Any issues of load imbalance among the remaining non-retail and non-residential tenants shall be addressed though an application for customer submetering pursuant to SMC Section 21.49.100 (H) (3).

 B. Unless otherwise superceded by an individually adopted contract rate pursuant to Subsection C below, a New Large Load Customer shall be billed pursuant to the rates set forth in SMC 21.49.058, Schedule VRC.

 C. Notwithstanding the one-year commitment otherwise provided in Schedule VRC, a New Large Load customer may elect to work with the Department to create a more tailored power delivery package either before a New Large Load is energized or after being billed under Schedule VRC for any period of time.

 1. Elements of a tailored power delivery package could include:

 a. A power price indexed to alternate market price indices as in the Energy Charge of Schedule VRC;

 b. Pass-through cost of a specific power supply contract provided to the Department by a third party;

 c. A power price index rate, as in subsection (a) above, combined with the pass-through of the cost of a specific power supply contract provided to the Department by a third party, as in subsection (b) above;

 d. Pass through of the costs, in whole or in part, of the Department's equity position in a new generation resource;

 e. A power price based upon the Department's estimated cost of purchasing power for the New Large Load over an identified period, including an appropriate risk premium for the power price risk that the Department would be assuming;

 f. A rate based on the New Resources rate charged by the Bonneville Power Administration for that portion of the customer's power needs the Department is able to purchase from the Bonneville Power Administration under Bonneville's current or future contract provisions for serving new large loads.

 g. Supplementing purchased power with the Department's own generation resources, provided the price of utilizing those resources is related to market value; or

 h. Other power purchase arrangements and associated prices that may be proposed as a result of discussions between the Department and a New Large Load customer.

 2. Such a tailored power delivery package shall also include:

 a. Energy and demand charges which reflect the incremental cost of providing energy and capacity to meet the requirements of the New Large Load, including the costs of transmitting energy to the Department's service area and the cost of transmission losses, taxes, ancillary services and administrative services directly related to the provision of New Large Load service;  b. The cost of mitigating greenhouse gas emissions associated with the provision of energy to serve the New Large Load in accordance with Resolution 30144;

 c. A delivery charge which reflects the incremental costs, other than costs incurred in connecting the customer to the electrical delivery system, of delivering power to the customer through the Department's transmission and distribution systems; and

 d. Charges to recover the costs of customer service, billing, public purpose programs and streetlighting services

 e. A term of five years, or less, except when exceptional circumstances or power purchase arrangements justify a longer term.

 3. Any such tailored power delivery package shall be adopted by ordinance.

 D. In addition to installation costs under SMC 21.49.110 (T), a New Large Load customer shall reimburse the Department for all costs incurred in extending distribution lines and providing substation capacity to supply three-phase service to the New Large Load.

 Section 4. City Light shall submit a report to the Energy and Environmental Policy Committee by August 31, 2001 and yearly thereafter assessing the potential impact of both new large loads and smaller dense loads on system costs, revenues, and net income. This analysis should include:

 a. An assessment of how such loads are projected to contribute to overall system load;

 b. An analysis of the specific effects of smaller dense loads and their impact on both infrastructure needs and energy purchases;

 c. An analysis of whether it may be appropriate to establish alternative new classes for these customers, and an evaluation of alternative rate structures for this class (or classes) of customers; and

 d. A review of how other utilities, both public and private, have responded to these types of loads.

 Section 5. A new section 21.49.082 is added to the Seattle Municipal Code, to read as follows:

21.49.082 Net Metering Program

A. The Department shall offer a net metering program in accordance with Revised Code of Washington chapter 80.60 and Seattle Municipal Code chapter 21.49. The Department shall develop and enter into net metering agreements, consistent with such laws, with customers desiring to participate in the net metering program. Customers are required to enter into net metering agreements and to comply with their terms as a condition of participation in the net metering program. The Department is authorized to establish policies and procedures for implementing the net metering program.  B. The net metering program shall be available to customers that have net metering systems on a first come, first served basis until such time as the cumulative nameplate capacity of such systems exceeds 1.9 megawatts (0.1 percent of the Department's peak demand during 1996); provided that the net metering program shall not be available to new customers using fuel cells once the aggregate nameplate capacity of fuel cells in the net metering program equals 0.9 megawatts (0.05 percent of the Department's peak demand during 1996), and provided further that the net metering program shall not be available to customers served by an underground distribution network, unless safety concerns can be adequately addressed.

 C. Net metering program customers shall be metered, billed and credited as follows:

 (1) In accordance with its normal metering practices, the Department shall measure the net electricity produced or consumed by each net metering program customer during the billing period applicable to that net metering program customer's rate schedule for electric service.

 (2) If the electricity supplied to an net metering program customer by the Department exceeds the electricity generated by that customer and fed back to the Department during the billing period, that customer shall be billed in accordance with its then-current rate schedule for the net electricity supplied by the Department. If electricity generated by an net metering program customer and fed back to the Department exceeds the electricity supplied by the Department during a billing period, that net metering program customer shall be billed for all charges (including any minimum charges) applicable to that customer's rate schedule, and shall be credited for the excess kilowatt-hours generated and fed-back to the Department. A kilowatt hour credit shall appear on the bill for the following billing period, shall be applied only to reduce the metered amount of kilowatt hours billed by the Department to that customer, and shall be carried forward until the end of each calendar year. At the beginning of the next calendar year, any unused kilowatt-hour credit accumulated during the previous year shall be granted to the Department, without any compensation to the net metering program customer.

 Section 6. Any act pursuant to the authority and prior to the effective date of this ordinance is hereby ratified and confirmed.

 Section 7. This ordinance shall take effect and be in force thirty (30) days from and after its approval by the Mayor, but if not approved and returned by the Mayor within (10) days after presentation, it shall take effect as provided by Municipal Code Section 1.04.020.
