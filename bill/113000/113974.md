 Exhibit A

 AMENDMENT TO THE CONSERVATION FUTURES INTERLOCAL COOPERATION AGREEMENT BETWEEN KING COUNTY AND THE CITY OF SEATTLE FOR OPEN SPACE ACQUISITION PROJECTS

 Preamble

 The King County Council, through Ordinance 9128, established a Conservation Futures Levy Fund to collect the Conservation Futures Levy proceeds. The King County Council also has periodically approved allocations of such proceeds to the City of Seattle. This amendment is entered into to provide for the allocation of additional funds made available for open space acquisition.

 THIS AMENDMENT is entered into between the CITY OF SEATTLE and KING COUNTY, and amends and attaches to and is part thereof of the existing Interlocal Cooperation Agreement entered into between the parties on the 5th day of June, 1990, as previously amended.

 The parties agree to the following amendments:

 Amendment 1: Article 1. Recitals

 A paragraph is hereby added to the Recitals Section to provide for a Conservation Futures Levy Fund allocation for the Seattle Art Museum ("SAM") Olympic Sculpture Park, and hereafter reads:

 On December 15, 2000, the King County Council passed Ordinance 14018 which appropriated a total of One Million Dollars ($1,000,000) in Conservation Futures Levy proceeds to the City of Seattle for Project 315400, Olympic Sculpture Park, subject to a requirement that the executive, after consultation with the prosecuting attorney, certify in writing to the council that the 10 Broad Street project site ("Site") meets the criteria of open space as defined in RCW 84.34. On April 23, 2001, the executive provided such certification contingent on the City of Seattle meeting the following conditions:

 A. The existing building and parking lot are removed utilizing funds other than Conservation Futures.

 B. The City of Seattle amends the Conservation Futures Interlocal Agreement with King County to include a project scope that remains consistent with RCW 84.34.

 C. The City of Seattle designates the Site as open space in their adopted comprehensive plan, with underlying zoning that allows such designation and use, meeting RCW 84.34.020(1)(a); or

 D. The Site meets at least one of the following open space categories of RCW 84.34.020(1)(b):

 ( The Site enhances the value to the public of a larger abutting park, meeting the definition of RCW 84.34.020(1)(iv);

 ( The open space would preserve visual quality along a major public right-of-way, meeting the definition of RCW 84.34.020(1)(vii).

 The City and the County hereby find and declare that the development of the Site would encroach upon the significant recreational, social, scenic and esthetic values of the Site as an open area and of the adjacent Myrtle Edwards Park and the Olympic Sculpture Park within the meaning of RCW 84.34.200. The City and the County hereby further find and declare that acquisition of and use of the Site for open space as part of the Olympic Sculpture Park will:

 ( Enhance the value to the public of abutting or neighboring parks or other open space, including Myrtle Edwards Park and Elliott Bay Park, within the meaning of RCW 84.34.020(iv);

 ( Preserve visual quality along highway, road and street corridors including Broad Street and Alaska Way and scenic vistas of Elliott Bay within the meaning of RCW 84.34.020(vi); and, in addition,

 * Enhance passive recreation opportunities through public enjoyment of art sited in a park-like setting within the meaning of RCW 84.34.020(v).

 Amendment 2: Article V. Conditions of Agreement

 Section 5.1 is amended to include Attachment N, which lists a 2000 Conservation Futures Levy Allocation for the Seattle Art Museum Olympic Sculpture Park project and hereafter reads:

 Section 5.1 Project Description. Funds available pursuant to this agreement may be used only for Projects. Current Projects are listed in Attachments A through N. The County may approve other Projects in the future.

 Amendment 3: Article VII. Responsibilities of County

 The first two sentences of this article are amended to include Attachment N, which lists a 2000 Conservation Futures Levy proceeds allocation for the Seattle Art Museum Olympic Sculpture Park Project:

 Subject to the terms of this agreement, the County will provide Conservation Futures Levy Funds in the amounts shown in Attachments A through N to be used for the Projects listed in Attachments A through N. The City may request additional funds; however, the County has no obligation to provide funds to the City for the Projects in excess of the total amounts shown in Attachments A through N. The County assumes no obligation for the future support of the Projects described herein except as expressly set forth in this agreement.

 In all other respects, the terms, conditions, duties and obligations of both parties shall remain the same as agreed to in the Interlocal Cooperation Agreement as previously amended.

 This document shall be attached to the existing Interlocal Cooperation Agreement.
