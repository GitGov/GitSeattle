 Section 1. As requested by the Director of the Seattle Center and recommended by the Mayor, the Mayor or his designee is authorized to contract for and accept grant funds of Nine Hundred Sixty-five Thousand Six Hundred Dollars ($965,600), or however much as may be granted by the FTA, for Monorail rehabilitation. Such funds, when received, shall be deposited in the Cumulative Reserve Subfund, Unrestricted Subaccount, as partial reimbursement for the appropriation authorized in Section 3 below.

 Section 2. Local matching funds from Seattle Monorail Services of Two Hundred Forty-one Thousand Four Hundred Dollars ($241,400), or however much as may be required as the local match for the FTA grant referenced in Section 1 hereof, are hereby accepted and shall be deposited in the Cumulative Reserve Subfund, Unrestricted Subaccount, as partial reimbursement for the appropriation authorized in Section 3 below.

 Section 3. Contingent upon the documentation of commitment of grant funds referenced in Section 4 hereof, the sum of One Million Two Hundred Seven Thousand Dollars ($1,207,000), or so much thereof as is the sum of the FTA grant plus the Seattle Monorail Services local match, is hereby appropriated from the Cumulative Reserve Subfund, Unrestricted Subaccount (00164), to the Monorail Improvements Project (S9403). All unreimbursed project costs shall be the obligation of the Seattle Center, either through its operating fund or existing capital appropriations, with the appropriation referenced in this section serving merely as a source of interim financing.

The Director of Seattle Center is authorized, contingent upon documentation of commitment of grant funds satisfactory to the City Finance Director, and upon compliance with State laws and City ordinances, to proceed with construction activities. Seattle Center shall provide the City Budget Office with monthly status reports of amounts spent on Monorail Improvement construction activities and amounts reimbursed by the FTA and Seattle Monorail Services.

 Section 5. Any act consistent with the authority and prior to the effective date of this ordinance is hereby ratified and confirmed.

 Section 6. The foregoing appropriation is made to meet actual necessary expenditures of the City for which no appropriation has been made due to causes which could not reasonably have been foreseen at the time of the adoption of the 2001 Budget.
