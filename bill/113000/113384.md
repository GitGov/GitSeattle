 ORDINANCE __________________

 AN ORDINANCE related to the 2000 Annual Budget of the Department of Finance General; increasing expenditure allowances by $50,000 for the purpose of developing and evaluating a firearm safety pilot program; and ratifying and confirming prior acts; all by a three- fourths vote of the City Council.

 WHEREAS, despite declining crime rates nationwide, gun violence continues to pose a serious and ever increasing threat to the safety and welfare of the public; and

 WHEREAS, access to firearms poses a significant risk factor that contributes to firearm violence and accidental gun injuries and deaths in the City of Seattle; and

 WHEREAS, according to the 1998 Behavioral Risk Factor Survey conducted by Washington State, approximately 43,000 households in Seattle contained a firearm within the home, of which an estimated 22,400 households contained firearms that were stored unlocked, and nearly 4,500 households contained firearms that were stored loaded and unlocked; and

 WHEREAS, according to the same 1998 Behavioral Risk Factor Survey, approximately 15,600 households in Seattle have children under 18 residing in a home containing a firearm, of which an estimated 5,850 households contained firearms that were stored unlocked, and approximately 1,200 households contained firearms that were stored loaded and unlocked; and

 WHEREAS, according to a study by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, in the dozen states, including California, which by the early 1990's passed laws making handgun owners responsible for storing their weapons in ways inaccessible to children, accidental firearm-related deaths among children younger than 15 dropped by nearly one-fourth (23 percent); and

 WHEREAS, the City benefits significantly from the promotion of safe firearm storage techniques in order to decrease firearm violence and gun-related injuries and deaths; and

 WHEREAS, the City is committed to protecting the public safety and welfare of its citizens;

 BE IT ORDAINED BY THE CITY OF SEATTLE AS FOLLOWS:

 SECTION 1. The Mayor or designee is hereby authorized to develop and evaluate a firearm safety pilot program. Funding for the pilot program will support the design, administration and analysis of a Firearm Safety Survey, designed by the City and other local partners to evaluate the use and efficacy of firearm safe storage techniques. The pilot program will also provide for the procurement and distribution of free gun lock devices which will be used as an incentive to encourage the citizens of Seattle to voluntarily store their handguns in a safer condition, and to encourage citizen participation in the aforementioned Firearm Safety Survey.

 SECTION 2. The following program category in the 2000 budget of the Department of Finance General is increased as follows:

 [Account Number Q5211025] $50,000

 and the sum of Fifty Thousand Dollars ($50,000) is appropriated from the General Subfund for the purposes outlined above. The appropriation of the funds in this ordinance shall carry forward from year to year unless expressly abandoned by ordinance.

 SECTION 3. The express purpose of this pilot program is to provide for and promote the health, safety and welfare of the general public, and not to protect individuals or create or otherwise establish or designate any particular class or group of persons who will or should be especially protected or benefited by this pilot program. The duties of safe manufacture and use of gun locks distributed through this pilot program remain with the manufacturer and user, respectively, who have knowledge and expertise beyond that of the City.

 SECTION 4. Any act consistent with the authority and prior to the effective date of this ordinance is hereby ratified and confirmed.

 SECTION 5. The foregoing appropriation is made to meet actual necessary expenditures of the City for which no appropriation has been made due to causes which could not reasonably have been foreseen at the time of the making of the 2000 Budget; Now Therefore, in accordance with RCW 35.32A.060, by reason of the facts stated above, this ordinance shall take effect and be in force thirty (30) days from and after its approval by the Mayor, but if not approved and returned by the Mayor within ten (10) days after presentation, it shall take effect as provided by Municipal Code Section 1.04.020.
