The money, when received, shall be deposited into the Supplemental Appropriations Account of the Emergency Subfund of the General Fund as reimbursement for the appropriation made in Section 2 of this ordinance.

 Section 2. The expenditure allowance for the Operations Line of Business in the 2001 Adopted Budget of the Fire Department is increased by Five Hundred Twenty Four Thousand Nine Hundred Seventy-nine Dollars ($524,979) by the appropriation, hereby made and authorized, of a like sum from the Supplemental Appropriations Account of the Emergency Subfund of the General Fund. Any portion of the above appropriation unexpended at the end of 2001 shall not lapse but shall be carried into future budget years until fully expended or abandoned by ordinance.

 Section 3. Any act consistent with the authority and prior to the effective date of this ordinance is hereby ratified and confirmed.

Now, therefore, in accordance with RCW 35.32A.060, by reason of the facts above stated, this ordinance shall take effect and be in force thirty (30) days from and after its approval by the Mayor, but if not approved and returned by the Mayor within ten (10) days after presentation, it shall take effect as provided by Municipal Code Section 1.04.020.
