 MEMORANDUM OF AGREEMENT by and between THE CITY OF SEATTLE and THE SEATTLE POLICE OFFICERS' GUILD

 The parties to this Memorandum of Agreement, the City of Seattle ("City") and the Seattle Police Officers' Guild ("Guild"), are contemporaneously executing a Collective Bargaining Agreement to cover the term from January 1, 2000, through December 31, 2002. This Memorandum of Agreement is being reached to explain and interpret provisions of the Collective Bargaining Agreement.

 1. The dollar loss reporting threshold for secondary operators in the Communications Center shall remain $1,500 for car prowls and $500 for other crimes. This dollar loss reporting threshold was first established by a Memorandum of Agreement dated December 12, 1996, and it was not intended that it would supplant the Telephone Reporting Unit functions.

 2. The parties have previously agreed on the attached job description labeled "Detective Aides" and that the Guild will not assert any collective bargaining or grievance rights should the City create a civilian job with the job duties listed in the job description. Should the City assign to civilian employees any duties currently being performed by Guild members that are not listed on the attached job description, the Guild shall retain collective bargaining and grievance rights over the assignment of such duties. It is the intent of the parties that detective aides are intended to assist detectives. There is no intent on the part of the City or the Guild that detective aides will supplant detectives. During the term of the parties' Collective Bargaining Agreement effective January 1, 2000, the City may employ no more than ten detective aides at any one time. In addition, the City may maintain no lesser ratio than twenty-two detectives to one detective aide.

 3. The parties have previously agreed on the attached language governing the use of storefront volunteers and storefront employees labeled "Storefront Volunteers/Employees" and that the Guild will not assert any collective bargaining or grievance rights should the City create such positions with the job duties listed in the attachment. Should the City assign to civilian employees any duties currently being performed by Guild members that are not listed on the attached job description, the Guild shall retain collective bargaining and grievance rights over the assignment of such duties.

 4. Supplemental Benefits Eligibility - Employees must meet the standards listed in SMC 4.44.080 to be eligible for the benefit amount provided in SMC 4.44.020, hereinafter referred to as supplemental benefits, which exceeds the rate required to be paid by state law. These standards require that employees: (1) comply with all Department of Labor and Industries rules and regulations and related City of Seattle and employing department policies and procedures; (2) respond, be available for, and attend medical appointments and treatments and meetings related to rehabilitation, work hardening, conditioning, or other treatment arranged by the City and authorized by the attending physician; (3) accept modified or alternative duty assigned by supervisors when released to perform such duty by the attending physician; (4) attend all meetings scheduled by the City of Seattle Industrial Insurance Unit or employing department concerning the employee's status or claim when properly notified at least five (5) working days in advance of such meeting unless other medical treatment conflicts with the meeting and the employee provides twenty- four (24) hours' notice of such meeting or examination.

 The City will provide a copy of the eligibility requirements to employees when they file a workers' compensation claim. If records indicate two (2) no-shows, supplemental benefits may be terminated no sooner than seven (7) days after notification to the employee. The City's action is subject to the grievance procedure.

 5. Already-Implemented Health Care Changes - The changes in health care coverage resulting from the City's change to self-insurance shall be maintained during the term of the Collective Bargaining Agreement.

 6. Changes In Health Care Plan Third-Party Administrators and/or Provider Networks - During the term of the Collective Bargaining Agreement and consistent with Section 11.11 of the Agreement, the City shall have the right to contract with and/or change one or more third- party administrators for health care benefit plans and to change provider networks, even though such a change may exclude the health care providers of some employees from coverage under the City's benefit plans, if benefits remain substantially similar to the current level of benefits. The City shall provide SPOG with at least 30 days written notice of any change of provider networks and/or third party administrators.

 7. The parties agree that the following shall be agenda items for discussion by the Labor-Management Committee: vacation scheduling; changing the clothing allowance to a voucher and/or quartermaster system; the 72-hour notice provision, Section 7.3; access to, retention of, and the contents of personnel files; the procedures used by the City with respect to employees who initially fail to qualify with their firearms, Section 7.5; and alternative work shifts. The parties also agree that patrol shift start times would be an appropriate topic for an Employee Involvement Committee.

 8. Transfers - The Collective Bargaining Agreement calls for the use of a Disciplinary Review Board (DRB) to hear appeals of disciplinary action and defines as disciplinary action "Suspensions, demotions, terminations, and disciplinary transfers identified by the City." If the Guild believes that a transfer not identified by the City as disciplinary in nature is in fact disciplinary, the Guild's challenge to the transfer shall be handled through the normal grievance procedure.

 9. Disciplinary Review Board - In the event the City receives simultaneous appeals of the same disciplinary action through an appeal to the Public Safety Civil Service Commission and to the Disciplinary Review Board (DRB), the City shall provide notice of the simultaneous appeals to the Guild. If both appeals are still pending after fourteen (14) days from the receipt of such notice by the Guild, the appeal to the DRB shall be deemed withdrawn.

 10. The provisions of Section 3.6A apply only to complaints received after the execution of the Collective Bargaining Agreement.

 11. Office of Professional Accountability (OPA) Review Board - The OPA Review Board Auditor position and the right of the Review Board to recommend further investigation of an Internal Investigations Section (IIS) complaint shall be eliminated. The current IIS Auditor position and functions of the IIS Auditor shall be continued, with the IIS Auditor reporting to the Mayor and Council. It is understood that the procedure for selecting the IIS Auditor may include various community groups.

 12. Parking - During the term of the Agreement, the City shall continue the current practice with respect to employee parking.

 13. Equal Employment Opportunity (EEO) Investigations - The Department may assign the responsibility for EEO matters, including investigations, outside the Internal Investigations Section, provided the investigation is conducted in accordance with the Collective Bargaining Agreement and provided any questioning of bargaining unit members is conducted by an EEO investigator who is a sworn member with the civil service rank of sergeant. If the subject of the complaint is the EEO Investigator, the questioning shall be conducted by a sworn member other than the EEO investigator.
