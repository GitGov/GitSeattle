 BE IT ORDAINED BY THE CITY OF SEATTLE AS FOLLOWS:

 Section 1 The City Council finds that the Seattle Public Library Board of Trustees (the "Board") has considered the proposed change to the allocation of Bond proceeds, and as reflected in the minutes of the October 4, 1999 meeting, the Board recommended the change in allocation.

 Section 2 The City Council finds that the Libraries for All Oversight Committee (the "Committee") has considered the proposed change to the allocation of Bond proceeds, and as reflected by the minutes of the September 10, 1999 meeting, the Committee recommended the change in allocation.

 Section 3 The City Council finds that the Mayor has considered the proposed change to the allocation of Bond proceeds, and by letter dated October 6, 1999, the Mayor recommended the change in allocation.

 Section 4 The City Council held a public hearing on this matter on November 9, 1999.

 Section 5 The City Council, having considered the recommendations of the Board, the Committee, and the Mayor, and the testimony received at the public hearing, finds that the provisions of Section 3 of Ordinance 119019 have been met, and that reallocation of the Bond proceeds is in the best interest of the City in order to ensure that funds from Bond proceeds and other sources are applied to the program components listed in Ordinance 119019 in a manner consistent with the parameters approved by the voters.

 Section 6 The allocation of Fifty Seven Million Nine Hundred Thousand Dollars ($57,900,000) to the neighborhood library facilities component in Section 1, Ordinance 119019 is reduced by Fifteen Million Dollars ($15,000,000) to Forty-Two Million Nine Hundred Thousand Dollars ($42,900,000).

 Section 7 The allocation of One Hundred Twenty-Eight Million Six Hundred Thousand Dollars ($128,600,000) to the central library component in Section 1, Ordinance 119019 is increased by Fifteen Million Dollars ($15,000,000) to One Hundred Forty-Three Million, Six Hundred Thousand Dollars ($143,600,000).

 Section 8 The executive is authorized and directed to execute a contract by December 31, 1999, with the Board committing the City to provide Ten Million Three Hundred Thousand Dollars ($10,300,000) in non-Bond City funding for the neighborhood library facilities component of the Libraries for All program as follows: $2.410 million in 2001; $2.617 million in 2002; $1.204 million in 2003; $1.198 million in 2004; $1.416 million in 2005; and $1.455 million in 2006. The yearly amounts may be adjusted, before or after the contract is executed, by mutual agreement of the City and the Board but by 2006 the total amount will be at least $10.3 million. The contract shall provide that this funding is contemplated to be from the Cumulative Reserve Subfund of the City, but it shall not preclude the use instead of other City resources not derived from the voter-approved Bonds.

 Section 9 This ordinance shall take effect and be in force thirty (30) days from and after its approval by the Mayor, but if not approved and returned by the Mayor within ten (10) days after presentation, it shall take effect as provided by Municipal Code Section 1.04.020.
