 version 2 PRELIMINARY REPORT  EVALUATION OF REUSE FOR

 PMA #763 - QUEEN ANNE PUMP STATION

Resolution 29799 directs the Executive to make its recommendations on the reuse or disposal of excess property on a case by case basis, using the Procedures for Evaluation of the Reuse and Disposal of the City's Real Property adopted by that resolution. Additionally, the Resolution identifies guidelines, which are to be considered in making a recommendation. This report addresses each of the guidelines outlined in Resolution 29799 in support of the recommendation.

Property Management Area: PMA #763 - Queen Anne Pump Station

 BACKGROUND INFORMATION

Legal Description: Lots 3 and 4, Block 33, Mercer's Second Addition to North Seattle, according to the plat thereof, recorded in Volume 2, Page 7 of Plats, in King County, Washington.

Physical Description and Related Factors: This 15,360 square foot site is rectangular in shape. Although the majority of the site is relatively level, the south one-third of the site drops off approximately 20 feet . There is a 580 square foot, vacant, stone building on the NE corner of the site which housed the pump station. There are no known critical areas at the site.

Guideline A: Consistency

The analysis should consider the purpose for which the property was originally acquired, funding sources used to acquire the property, terms and conditions of original acquisition, the title or deed conveying the property, or any other contract or instrument by which the City is bound or to which the property is subject, and City, state or federal ordinances, statues and regulations.

 The property was acquired with Water Fund monies in 1891 for use as a pumping station to serve the top of Queen Anne hill with water. The pump station was abandoned in 1977 when a larger, more efficient pump station was placed into service at another location. In 1996, following the circulation and notification process, the Queen Anne neighborhood had expressed interest in having a park at this site. Because the neighborhood planning process was still pending, the City Council placed the property under the jurisdiction of the Department of Administrative Services (now Fleets and Facilities Department), pending further review. Ordinance 118432 transferred jurisdiction of the property to ESD (now Fleets and Facilities Department) and an appropriation of $607,000 from the Cumulative Reserve Fund, Unrestricted Subaccount #11650, was made to reimburse the Water Fund for the fair market value of the property as required by law.

Guideline B: Compatibility and Suitability

The recommendation should reflect an assessment of the potential for use of the property in support of adopted Neighborhood Plans, as or in support of low-income housing, in support of economic development, in support of affordable housing, for park or open space; in support of Sound Transit Link Light Rail station area development; as or in support of child care facilities, and in support of other priorities reflected in adopted City policies.

Context. The property is located at approximately 925 4th Avenue N. in a dense, urban neighborhood of single family and multi-family residences on the south slope of Queen Anne Hill. East-west streets are narrow, while north-south streets are steep, impeding traffic and making parking difficult. There is a shortage of park and open space in the area.

Range of Options.

 The primary options for reuse and/or disposition are use as open space/community garden or housing. Zoning or traffic limitations preclude other uses. Due to the high value of the land, affordable housing on this site would be difficult to develop. In passing Ordinance 118432 in 1996, the City Council recognized that proposals for community open space and/or p-patch might be the optimal use for the property. Such uses remain a high priority component within the Queen Anne neighborhood plan. At this time, the community planning process facilitated by the Department of Parks and Recreation (DPR) has favored development of the site for a small urban park with an accessible path, a small play area, dry streambed, stone stairs, entry plaza, an arbor, three wooden bridges, lawn areas, shrub beds and trees. Partial funding for park development was included in the Parks and Green Spaces Levy approved by the voters in 2000.

 Transferring jurisdiction for the property to DPR will enable DPR and the neighborhood to move forward with development of the park.

 Guideline C: Other Factors

The recommendation should consider the highest and best use of the property, compatibility of the proposed use with the physical characteristics of the property and with surrounding uses,

 timing and term of the proposed use, appropriateness of the consideration to be received, unique attributes that make the property hard to replace, potential for consolidation with adjacent public property to accomplish future goals and objectives, conditions in the real estate market, and known environmental factors that may affect the value of the property.

Highest and Best Use: The property was appraised in 1996 at the time it was declared excess by the Water Department. From a market perspective, the highest and best use of the site is for development of three single-family homes.

Compatibility with surrounding uses: Both the housing and park options would be compatible with surrounding uses. The most likely use of the property is for use as a neighborhood park as recommended in the neighborhood plan. Such uses will benefit the surrounding neighborhood, which has a low percentage of park/open space.

Potential for Consolidation with adjacent public property: There is no adjacent public property available for consolidation.

Timing and Term of Proposed Use: The Department of Parks and Recreation has initiated the design process for the site and its eventual park-related use will be in perpetuity.

 Appropriateness of the consideration: Based on the highest and best use, the fair market value for the site was determined to be $607,000 at the time Ordinance 118432 was approved. The Water Fund was reimbursed from the Cumulative Reserve Fund at that time. No funding is involved in this transfer of jurisdiction from the Fleets and Facilities Department to the Department of Parks and Recreation.

Known environmental factors: There is no known clean-up or other remedial treatment indicated for the Queen Anne Pump Station. If the small pump station building will be torn down, the estimated cost is $5,000 - $7,000 (1996 dollars). The building is not architecturally significant, and there are no known factors to prevent its demolition. DPR and the community have not made a final decision on whether to remove the pump house.

Guideline D: Sale

The recommendation should evaluate the potential for selling the property to non-City public entities and to members of the general public.

 Under Ordinance 118432, the City Council envisioned potential future development of this property for a municipal purpose such as park and/or open space. Given that the neighborhood has continued to place a high priority on such use of the property, and that DPR and DON are working with the neighborhood to create a plan for the site, sale of the property, despite its marketability, would not be in the best interest of the City.

RECOMMENDATION

The Real Estate Oversight Committee recommends that the jurisdiction for this property be transferred from the Fleets and Facilities Department to the Department of Parks and Recreation, and that DPR and DON continue working with the neighborhood to develop community open space at the site.
