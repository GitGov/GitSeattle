 morris/ SECOND SUPPLEMENT TO MEMORANDUM OF AGREEMENT FOR INTERGOVERNMENTAL COOPERATION  between Central Puget Sound Regional Transit Authority (Sound Transit) and The City of Seattle For the Central Link Light Rail Project

 This SECOND SUPPLEMENT to that certain April 20, 1998 MEMORANDUM OF AGREEMENT FOR INTERGOVERNMENTAL COOPERATION FOR THE CENTRAL LINK LIGHT RAIL TRANSIT PROJECT ("Second Supplement") is entered into by and between the CENTRAL PUGET SOUND REGIONAL TRANSIT AUTHORITY (hereinafter referred to as "Sound Transit") and THE CITY OF SEATTLE (hereinafter referred to as "the City") as of ___________, _____.

 RECITALS

 A. The 2001-2002 timeframe is a critical period for Sound Transit's Central Link Light Rail Project. Sound Transit has now received approval from the Federal Transit Administration (FTA) to perform final design, and to acquire right-of-way for the entire light rail route within the City of Seattle. The schedule for work during the 2001-2002 timeframe includes completion of the final designs for all civil facilities in Seattle, including the stations. In addition, construction is scheduled to be underway on the tunnel connecting Downtown, First Hill, Capitol Hill, and the University District (235); along the E-3 Busway and S. Forest Street (S 700); the Maintenance Base (810); and the East Beacon Hill Tunnel Portal to S. Walden Street segment in Rainier Valley (S 720).

 B. Sound Transit recognizes that the City of Seattle is responsible for administering state and local transportation and land use laws and development regulations that will apply to the development, construction, and operations of the Central Link Light Rail Project. In addition, the City is responsible for review and approval of plans, utility relocation, construction monitoring and inspection, managing the City street system, and the public health and welfare of citizens.

 C. The City and Sound Transit entered into an agreement titled "Memorandum of Agreement for Intergovernmental Cooperation Regarding Light Rail Development" on April 20, 1998. That Memorandum of Agreement ("April 20, 1998 MOA") sets forth the parties' common and individual objectives with respect to the development of a light rail system between Seattle and the city of Sea-Tac, and describes arrangements for intergovernmental cooperation; processes for environmental reviews; expedited processing of requests for permits, easements, and vacations of streets and right-of-way; understandings regarding the project budget and funding; the schedule for decision making, planning and construction; agreements regarding station area and land use planning and public involvement; and processes for dispute resolution; all in connection with that proposed light rail development.

 D. Pursuant to paragraph VIII C. of the April 20, 1998 MOA, the City agrees to comply with applicable federal funding requirements in connection with its receipt of funds from Sound Transit to perform certain tasks under the MOA and subsequent agreements as described in the March 27, 1998 letter from Sound Transit to the City.

 E. The City recognizes that Sound Transit has responsibility for acquisition of property and the Transit Oriented Development process which is governed by Sound Transit Board policy and state and federal regulations.

 F. The City and Sound Transit entered into an agreement on April 30, 1998, pursuant to which the City provides Geographic Information System ("GIS") products, services, and data to support the activities of Sound Transit ("the GIS MOA"), which agreement may be amended from time to time.

 G. The City and Sound Transit entered into an agreement titled "First Supplement to Memorandum of Agreement for Intergovernmental Cooperation... for the Central Link Light Rail Transit Project" ("First Supplement") on October 25, 1999. Services undertaken pursuant to the First Supplement were performed in 1999 and 2000. The scope of the First Supplement included design review services, design development support, utility coordination, implementation coordination, mitigation identification, and analysis and development support activities, through the Central Link Light Rail Project's preliminary engineering phase.

 H. As anticipated by the parties in onstructionIII.E of the April 20, 1998 MOA, Sound Transit desires actions by the City to support the completion of design and construction of the Central Link Light Rail Project. This Second Supplement, except as otherwise provided herein, shall cover services to be provided by the City in three major areas: Public Works; Public Safety; and Business Retention and Community Assistance.

 Public Works services will be provided by various City departments including Seattle City Light (City Light), Seattle Public Utilities (SPU), Seattle Department of Parks and Recreation (Parks), Seattle Transportation Department (SEATRAN), and portions of the Department of Design, Construction and Land Use (DCLU). Services to be performed by these City departments include design review approval; design development support; utility coordination and relocation; implementation coordination; construction support including inspections, analysis and development support activities; construction plan review and approval; and permitting.

 City Public Safety services will be provided by the City's Fire (SFD) and Police Departments (SPD). Services to be performed by the Fire Department include design review, construction monitoring and support, and tunnel rescue. Services to be performed by the Police Department include design review, and provision of traffic control during construction.

 City of Seattle Business Retention and Community Assistance services will be provided by the City's Strategic Planning Office (SPO) with support from the Office of Housing (OH), Office of Economic Development (OED), and portions of the Department of Design, Construction and Land Use (DCLU). Services to be performed by these City departments and offices include design development support, implementation coordination, business retention and assistance, analysis and development support activities, transit oriented development support, station area management, and land use code development related to Sound Transit permitting and station development. The City's Business Retention and Community Assistance efforts will be closely coordinated with Sound Transit.

 Sound Transit and City Goals and Objectives:

 * Work collaboratively to initiate the construction phase of the Central Link Light Rail Project. Effectively manage the project to provide the citizens of Seattle and the region with a quality light rail system in a cost effective and timely manner.

 * Develop and apply innovative state of the art practices in the delivery of Public Works, Public Safety, and Business Retention and Community Assistance Services to facilitate the Central Link Light Rail construction schedule, while protecting the interests of Seattle's business and residential communities.

 * Have Sound Transit provide clear and complete design drawings and supplementary information to facilitate the City's design review to allow the Central Link Light Rail Project to proceed on schedule.

 * Work closely to maximize the efficiency of construction inspection activities without compromising the City's need for specialized inspection of the City's infrastructure.

 * Communicate clearly, and participate in regularly scheduled interdisciplinary coordination meetings to address issues that arise which may affect the Central Link Light Rail Project scope, schedule, budget or the communities affected by light rail construction. Identify and address issues as early as possible.

 Status of Work in the First Supplement.

 Pursuant to the First Supplement, the City played a crucial role helping Sound Transit meet several major milestones for the Central Link Light Rail Project. These included the selection of a Locally Preferred Alternative, the timely completion of the Draft and Final Environmental Impact Statements, the issuance of a Record of Decision, completion of Preliminary Engineering, and submittal of a Full Funding Grant Application.

 In addition, the City adopted key legislation to facilitate the construction and operation of the Central Link Light Rail Project. City legislation included resolutions approving rail stations and alignment, an ordinance allowing Sound Transit construction staging areas to be permitted as "temporary" uses, an ordinance approving provisions for permitting permanent light rail facilities on private property, an ordinance allowing Sound Transit to use City right of way for light rail, an ordinance adopting the Downtown Tunnel Transfer Agreement, a resolution for Station Area Planning Framework Goals and Strategies, an ordinance adopting a Interim Station Area Overlay Zone and two ordinances extending the interim overlay, and approval of a resolution adopting Concept Level Recommendations and Citywide Vision for Station Areas.

 In accordance with the terms of the First Supplement, Sound Transit has reimbursed the City for valid expenses through December 31, 1999 related to the Central Link Light Rail Project. The table below summarizes estimated expenditures by City Departments and Offices for the 1999-2000 timeframe. Estimated expenses to date (through June 2000) and an estimate of the amount remaining at the end of year 2000 are also shown.

 In 1999 when the First Supplement was negotiated, the Locally Preferred Alternative for Link Light Rail had not yet been determined. Both the City and Sound Transit agreed to defer making cost estimates for the Department of Design, Construction and Land Use (DCLU) activities in the year 2000 because not enough was known about what level of permitting and design review would be required. In addition, the Office of Economic Development (OED) has identified expenses for the Business Retention program that Sound Transit agreed to fund beginning in 2000. This Second Supplement provides for Sound Transit to reimburse DCLU and OED for expenses incurred in the year 2000 in support of the Central Link Light Rail Project in addition to 2001-2002 expenses as specifically described herein, now that the requirements are better defined.

 Use of Unexpended Balance from the First Supplement

 Sound Transit and the City will identify actual unexpended balances and tasks not implemented at the end of year 2000 that were included in the First Supplement. Appropriate tasks and associated budget will be carried over into 2001, as agreed to by the City and Sound Transit. Sound Transit will reimburse the City for actual expenses occurring in 2001 which are related to the identified First Supplement tasks. The table below shows an estimate of the First Supplement balances that may be remaining at the end of 2000.

 D. Monitoring and Reporting of Costs

 The City's Designated Representative, or other designated City official, shall coordinate requests for reimbursements by all City departments and offices and will provide cost reports to Sound Transit concurrent with the quarterly progress reports. The total amount to be paid as reimbursement under this Second Supplement is estimated to be a maximum of $22,804,646, with $391,571 being the estimated maximum reimbursement payable in 2000, $11,668,392 being the estimated maximum reimbursement payable in 2001 and $10,744,683 being the estimated maximum reimbursement payable in 2002.

 E. Reconciliation

 Both parties agree to monitor and reconcile the actual versus estimated effort quarterly and to negotiate additional funding, a shifting of funds from 2001 allocation to 2002's allocation (or vice versa), or a reduction in services relating to the Central Link Light Rail Project to the extent that such work cannot be performed within the estimate of compensation and expense reimbursement due for the services delivered and work performed as negotiated between the City and Sound Transit in this Second Supplement.

 An exception to this is that if plan review and inspection work performed by DCLU, for which payment on an hourly rate is in lieu of paying value-based construction permit fees, exceeds the estimated amount, Sound Transit shall be responsible for the additional costs without further negotiations.

 By mutual agreement (and without the need for a formal amendment of this Second Supplement), the parties may reallocate the estimated maximum amount to be reimbursed in either 2001 or 2002 to the other year. At the end of the year 2002, any funds not expended pursuant to this agreement may be reallocated by Sound Transit to additional Central Link Light Rail Project activities covered by future agreements.

 V. DISPUTE RESOLUTION PROCESS

 The parties remain committed to resolving issues cooperatively, expeditiously, and at the lowest possible staff level. However, as provided for in the April 20, 1998 MOA, the following is the agreed upon process for dispute resolution:

 A. General

 The Designated Representatives will use their best efforts to resolve disputes and issues arising out of or related to the tasks covered by this Second Supplement. The Designated Representatives will communicate regularly to discuss the status of the tasks to be performed and to resolve any issues or disputes related to the successful performance of this Second Supplement. The Designated Representatives will cooperate in providing staff support to facilitate the performance of this Second Supplement and the resolution of any issues or disputes arising during the term of this Second Supplement.

 B. Notice of Problem or Dispute and Meeting of Designated Representatives

 Each Designated Representative will notify the other in writing of any problem or dispute that the Designated Representative believes should be resolved. The Designated Representatives shall meet within three (3) Working Days of receiving the written notice in an attempt to resolve the dispute.

 C. Meeting of Directors

 In the event the Designated Representatives cannot resolve a dispute (and that dispute is not subject to some other formal appeal process), the Sound Transit Executive Director or his/her designee and the Director of the City's Strategic Planning Office or his/her designee shall meet within seven (7) Working Days of receiving notice from a Designated Representative and engage in good faith negotiations to resolve the dispute.

 D. Meetings are Prerequisites to Litigation

 Sound Transit and the City agree that they shall have no right to seek relief under this Second Supplement in a court of law until and unless each of these procedural steps is exhausted.

 VI. RECOGNITION OF CITY'S POLICE POWER

 Sound Transit recognizes the right vested in the City pursuant to general law to exercise its police power for the protection of the health, safety, and welfare of its citizens and their properties. Nothing in this Second Supplement shall be construed as precluding the City from exercising such power in connection with Sound Transit's light rail system except as specifically provided in this Second Supplement, and then, only to the extent this Second Supplement expressly precludes such exercise.

 VII. PRIORITY FOR STATE OF EMERGENCY SITUATIONS

 The time period required for performance of services under this Second Supplement, other than due dates for payments for services rendered or work performed by the City, shall be extended to include the length of any delay caused by or resulting from the prohibition or restriction of such action by the State or Federal government, or any fire, flood, storm, power failure, major equipment breakdown, war, labor trouble, accident, riot, act of Nature, or other event beyond the reasonable control of the party obligated to perform such services; provided, that the party adversely affected by such condition shall promptly advise the other party, in writing, of the occurrence of an event of force majeure and make a reasonable attempt to satisfy its obligations hereunder notwithstanding the event of force majeure.
