 NOW THEREFORE, BE IT ORDAINED BY THE CITY OF SEATTLE AS FOLLOWS:

 * * *

 C. Public Facilities.

 1. Except as provided in subsections C2~~a~~ and C~~2b~~3 below and in SMC 23.50.027, uses in public facilities that are most similar to uses permitted outright or permitted by conditional use in this chapter shall also be permitted outright or by conditional use, subject to the same use regulations, development standards and administrative conditional use criteria that govern the similar uses.

 2. Public Facilities Not Meeting Development Standards Requiring City Council Approval.

~~a.~~ The City Council may waive or modify applicable development standards or conditional use criteria for those uses in public facilities that are similar to uses permitted outright or permitted by conditional use according to the provisions of Chapter 23.76, Subchapter III, Council Land Use Decisions, with public projects considered as Type IV quasi-judicial decisions and City facilities considered as Type V legislative decisions.

 3. Other Uses Permitted in Public Facilities. Unless specifically prohibited, uses in public facilities that are not similar to uses permitted outright or permitted by a conditional use or special exception under this chapter may be permitted by the City Council. City Council may waive or modify development standards or conditional use criteria according to the provisions of Chapter 23.76, Subchapter III, Council Land Use Decisions, with public projects considered as Type IV quasi-judicial decisions and City facilities considered as Type V legislative decisions.

 4. In all industrial zones, uses in public facilities not meeting development standards may be permitted by the Council if the following criteria are satisfied:

 a. The project provides unique services which are not provided to the community by the private sector, such as police and fire stations; and

 b. The proposed location is required to meet specific public service delivery needs; and

 c. The waiver or modification to the development standards is necessary to meet specific public service delivery needs; and

 d. The relationship of the project to the surrounding area has been considered in the design, siting, landscaping and screening of the facility.

 5. Expansion of Uses in Public Facilities.

 a. Major Expansion. Major expansions may be permitted to uses in public facilities allowed in subsections C1, C2~~a~~ and C~~2b~~3 above according to the same provisions and procedural requirements as described in these subsections. A major expansion of a public facility use occurs when the expansion that is proposed would not meet development standards or exceed either seven hundred fifty (750) square feet or ten (10) percent of its existing area, whichever is greater, including gross floor area and areas devoted to active outdoor uses other than parking.

 b. Minor Expansion. When an expansion falls below the major expansion threshold level, it is a minor expansion. Minor expansions may be permitted to uses in public facilities allowed in subsections C1, C2~~a~~ and C~~2b~~3 above according to the provisions of Chapter 23.76, Procedures for Master Use Permits and Council Land Use Decisions, for a Type I Master Use Permit when the development standards of the zone in which the public facility is located are met.

 6. Essential Public Facilities. Permitted essential public facilities shall also be reviewed according to the provisions of Chapter 23.80, Essential Public Facilities.
