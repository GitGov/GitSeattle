 AN ORDINANCE relating to the City Light Department; amending Seattle Municipal Code, Chapter 21.49, to increase rates for the use of electricity.

 WHEREAS, Ordinance 120149, passed by the City Council on November 6, 2000, established rates for the sale of electricity by the Department for the period beginning January 1, 2001; and

 WHEREAS, the rates established by Ordinance 119747 effective December 24, 1999 assumed that the Department would incur net costs of $2.2 million in calendar year 2000 and $14.5 million in calendar year 2001 through its purchases and sales of power in the wholesale power market and the use of surplus energy to displace purchases of power from the Bonneville Power Administration and generation at the Centralia Steam Plant; and

 WHEREAS, the rates established by Ordinance 120149 assumed net purchased power costs of $53.9 million in 2000 and $15.8 million in 2001; and

 WHEREAS, the price of energy in the wholesale power market has been at historically high levels since May 2000; and

 WHEREAS, wholesale forward market prices lead to the expectation that prices will remain at high levels into 2001, exposing the Department to further variability in its financial results; and

 WHEREAS, drier than normal weather has decreased streamflows in the Skagit and Pend Oreille rivers, which decreases generation from City Light hydroelectric plants, and less than normal snowpack indicates a continuance of this situation; and

 WHEREAS, financial results in 2001 will be far below the targets used in setting the current rates unless action is taken to increase revenues; and

 WHEREAS, the Department and City are requesting that the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission impose a cap on wholesale electricity prices throughout the West; and

 WHEREAS, the Department is asking its customers to conserve ten percent of the energy they currently use at home and at work; and

 WHEREAS, the Department has proposed that rates be adjusted to eliminate the summer rate discount and include a further power cost adjustment equivalent to $.004/kWh effective March 1, 2001; and

 WHEREAS, the Department recommends that a portion of excess power costs in 2001 be deferred to 2002 and 2003 in an amount equal to revenues projected to be realized in those years from the power cost adjustment enacted by this ordinance; and

 WHEREAS, the City Council has expressed its commitment to taking whatever future rate actions are necessary to preserve the financial integrity of the Department; NOW THEREFORE,

 BE IT ORDAINED BY THE CITY OF SEATTLE AS FOLLOWS:

 Schedule VRC (Variable Rate General Service)

 Schedule VRC is an optional rate schedule for high demand general service provided to customers eligible to be served under Schedule HDC. A customer that chooses this rate schedule may not return to a standard rate schedule for a period of one (1) year after electing this schedule, provided that, should a new rate ordinance which changes Schedule VRC be adopted during this time, the customer may request return to a standard rate schedule upon the effective date of the new ordinance.

 At the time a customer elects to take service under Schedule VRC, the customer must choose whether to pay an energy charge as defined in Option 1 - DJ-COB or Option 2 - DJ Mid-Columbia. After choosing an energy charge option, a customer may not choose a different energy charge option for a period of one (1) year except that, should a new rate ordinance which changes Schedule VRC be adopted during this time, the customer may request a change in energy charge option upon the effective date of the new ordinance or may request return to a standard rate schedule upon the effective date of the new ordinance.

Peak and off-peak periods will be as defined by the DJ-COB price rather than as defined in the Demand Charges section of Schedule VRC or elsewhere in the ordinance codified in this section. In the case that a price is not available for a given day, the average of the preceding and following days' prices will be used. Peak and off-peak prices will be calculated separately via this method.

 Option 2 - DJ Mid-Columbia

 DJ Mid-Columbia Price in cents /kWh x 1.1562 + 0.15 cents /kWh

 The DJ Mid-Columbia (Dow Jones Mid-Columbia) price is the appropriate firm peak or off-peak DJ Mid-Columbia price index converted to cents per kWh for the day and time period of the consumption. Peak and off-peak periods will be as defined by the DJ Mid-Columbia price index rather than as defined in the Demand Charges section of Schedule VRC or elsewhere in this section. In the case that a price is not available for a given day, the average of the preceding and following days' prices will be used. Peak and off-peak prices will be calculated separately via this method.

 Retail Services Charge:

 1.43 cents /kWh

 Demand Charges: Peak: All kW of maximum demand between six (6:00) a.m. and ten (10:00) p.m., Monday through Saturday, excluding major holidays,* at $0.29 per kW Off-peak: All kW of maximum demand in excess of peak period maximum demand, at all times other than the peak period, at $0.17 per kW

 Minimum Charge: $125.07 per meter per day

 * Major holidays excluded from the peak period are New Year's Day, Memorial Day, Independence Day, Labor Day, Thanksgiving Day, and Christmas Day.

 Discounts: Transformer losses in kWh - 1756 + .53285 x kW + .00002 x kW2+ .00527 x kWh

 Transformer investment - $0.17 per kW of monthly maximum demand

 B. For customers metered on the primary side of a transformer, the Department will either program the meter to deduct computed transformer losses or provide a discount for transformer losses by reducing the monthly kWh billed by the number of kWh computed in Section 21.49.058, subsection A.

 C. For customers who provide their own transformation from the Department's standard distribution system voltage of four (4) kV, thirteen (13) kV, or twenty-six (26) kV to a utilization voltage, a discount for transformer investment will be provided in the amount stated in Section 21.49.058, subsection A. Existing customers served by the Department's 34.5 kV system as of January 1, 1995 shall be considered as receiving standard distribution voltage for the purpose of this section. This 34.5 kV voltage will not be offered as a standard distribution system voltage for any new customers.

 D. Customers must provide hourly load schedules each day for the following day. If a customer's load follows a regular pattern, the Department may, at its discretion, waive this requirement and request only to be informed of temporary or permanent changes to the pattern.

 E. The Department may request voluntary load interruption during an emergency. If interruption occurs, the demand charge will be waived for the billing period in which the interruption occurs.

 F. Customers who request service under Schedule VRC will be selected solely at the option of Seattle City Light.

 G. Customers served under Schedule VRC shall provide Seattle City Light with access to their telephone equipment and pay any initial and ongoing charges for additional telephone equipment needed for the Department to communicate with its metering equipment.

 Section 6. A new Section 21.49.081 is added to the Seattle Municipal Code, to read as follows:

 Automatic BPA Cost Adjustment  City Light will calculate the difference (in dollars) between what City Light would have paid for its BPA purchases for a twelve month period beginning October 1, 2001 under the rates contained in the BPA Final Proposal of May 2000 and what City Light will actually pay for the same period under the BPA rates in effect October 1, 2001. The dollar difference will then be multiplied by 1.1095, which is the effective tax rate, and the product divided by forecast load (in kWh) over the twelve month period beginning October 1, 2001 to calculate a number (in dollars/kWh rounded to the nearest thousandth of a dollar) which will be called the "BPA increment".

 For example, if the increase in BPA contract costs equaled $18,422,543 per year (a 17% increase), this cost increase would be multiplied by the 1.1095 effective tax rate to get required additional customer revenue of $20,439,811. This additional revenue required would then be divided by the forecast 9,136,407,000 kWh load to calculate a BPA increment of $.0022/kWh

 Energy charges in effect on October 1, 2001 under all rate schedules except Schedules T, F, and VRC and energy charges scheduled to take effect on March 1, 2002 under all rate schedules except T, F, and VRC will be increased by the BPA increment, provided that for customers served under Schedules REC, RLC, RES, and RLS, energy charges shall be increased by one-half of the BPA increment. The BPA increment will increase equally first block and second block charges in residential rates and peak and off-peak rates for large and high demand general service customers as well as the single energy charges for small and medium general service customers.

 Section 7. The provisions of this ordinance are declared to be separate and severable. If any one or more of the provisions of this ordinance shall be declared by any court of competent jurisdiction to be contrary to law, then such provision or provisions shall be null and void and severed from the rest of this ordinance, and all other provisions of this ordinance shall remain valid and enforceable.

 Section 8. This ordinance shall take effect and be in force thirty (30) days from and after its approval by the Mayor, but if not approved and returned by the Mayor within ten (10) days after presentation, it shall take effect as provided by Municipal Code Section 1.04.020.
