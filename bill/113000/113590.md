 AN ORDINANCE relating to the Ballard Civic/Municipal Center project; making an appropriation from the 2001 Capital Facilities Bond Fund, and increasing the expenditure authority in the fund for all the costs related to the acquisition of property for general municipal purposes as authorized in Ordinance 120234; and authorizing an interfund loan from the Cumulative Reserve Subfund to support that appropriation; all upon a three-fourths vote of the City Council.

 WHEREAS, Ordinance 120234 authorized the acquisition of certain real property and property rights, namely the former Ballard Safeway site; and provided that the entire cost of the acquisition shall be paid from such General Funds of the City of Seattle as may be provided by law; and

 WHEREAS, the City Council, in Ordinance 120169, authorized general obligation bonds for this project to be sold in the Summer of 2001 and created the 2001 Capital Facilities Bond Fund; and

 WHEREAS, negotiations to acquire certain real property have concluded prior to the referenced bond sale; and

 WHEREAS, selling general obligation bonds separate from the regular City bond sale planned for the summer of 2001 is not the most cost-effective or timely way to finance the acquisition and related costs for the Ballard Civic/Municipal Center project; and

 WHEREAS, the Cumulative Reserve Subfund will have sufficient cash available on an interim basis to support the acquisition and related costs until a permanent funding source becomes available in August 2001; and

 WHEREAS, the Cumulative Reserve Subfund will earn market rate interest on the project loan and will be reimbursed at such time as longer-term financing is secured; NOW, THEREFORE,

 BE IT ORDAINED BY THE CITY OF SEATTLE AS FOLLOWS:

 Section 1. To provide for the payment of the costs of the acquisition of certain real property and property rights for general municipal purposes, namely the former Ballard Safeway site as identified in Ordinance 120234, the expenditure allowance of the Ballard Civic/Municipal Center project (A51705) is increased by the appropriation of Five Million, Two Hundred Thousand Dollars ($5,200,000).

 Section 2. To support the appropriation made in Section 1, an interfund loan from the Cumulative Reserve Subfund to the 2001 Capital Facilities Bond Fund is authorized in the maximum amount of Five Million, Two Hundred Thousand Dollars ($5,200,000) or so much thereof as may be necessary to support the property acquisition and related costs of the Ballard Civic/Municipal Center project. The loan shall last no longer than August 31, 2001, unless extended by subsequent ordinance. The 2001 Capital Facilities Bond Fund shall pay interest to the Cumulative Reserve Subfund on the borrowed funds at a rate that reflects the consolidated cash pool's earnings on its other investments. The principal amount of the loan from the Cumulative Reserve Subfund together with interest will be repaid with proceeds from longer-term project funding expected to be obtained by the sale of General Obligation Bonds as provided by Ordinance 120169 and future Council action. The Director of Finance is hereby authorized to execute all necessary interfund loan documents and warrants and to make interfund loan transfers as necessary.

 Section 3. All acts consistent with the authority and prior to the effective date of this ordinance, including expenditures consistent with the purpose of this ordinance, are hereby ratified and confirmed.

 Section 4. The foregoing appropriations are made to meet actual necessary expenditures of the City for which insufficient appropriations have been made due to causes that could not reasonably have been foreseen at the time of the adoption of the 2001 Budget;

 Now, Therefore, in accordance with RCW 35.32A.060, by reason of the facts stated above, this ordinance shall take effect and be in force thirty (30) days from and after its passage and approval, if approved by the Mayor, but if not approved and returned by the Mayor within ten (10) days after presentation, it shall take effect as provided by Municipal Code Section 1.01.020.

 Approved by me this _____ day of _______________, 2001. ___________________________________ Paul Schell, Mayor
