 AN ORDINANCE submitting an advisory ballot measure concerning a proposed monorail to the qualified electors of the City at a special election to be held in conjunction with the state primary election on September 19, 2000.

 WHEREAS, the electors of the City of Seattle approved Initiative 41 on November 4, 1997, creating a public corporation called the Elevated Transportation Company ("ETC"); and

 WHEREAS, Initiative 41 chartered the ETC to build, maintain, and operate a 40-mile electrically powered, rubber tired and principally elevated mass transportation system along specified routes and with the locations of many stations specified; and

 WHEREAS, Initiative 41 provided that the ETC should attempt to locate private funding to carry out its goal of building the monorail system described in the initiative; and

 WHEREAS, the ETC has been unable, to date, to locate any significant private funding to advance the monorail system proposed in Initiative 41; and

 WHEREAS, Initiative 41 stated that the ETC could, after seeking private funding, seek public funds from the City to be provided by the issuance of an unspecified amount of councilmanic revenue bonds or by an unspecified increase in the City's Business and Occupations tax:

 "To this purpose, the City Council of Seattle shall make funds available to the PDA either by issuing Councilmanic Revenue bonds or raising the City's Business and Occupations tax." (Initiative 41, Article IV); and

 WHEREAS, the costs of monorail systems built or under construction within the last 15 years along public rights-of-way in the United States and abroad, for which information is presently available, range from $25 million to $232 million per mile; and

 WHEREAS, cost estimates for the construction of a monorail system in Seattle range from $35 million to $90 million or more per mile; and

 WHEREAS, based on these rough estimates of per-mile cost, the estimated cost to build a 40-mile citywide system ranges from $1.4 billion to $3.6 billion or more; and

 WHEREAS, a single monorail segment approximately 10 miles in length has also been proposed; and

 WHEREAS, based on the foregoing rough estimates of per-mile cost, the estimated cost to build a single 10-mile monorail segment ranges from $350 million to $900 million or more; and

 WHEREAS, City funds would be required to pay most of the construction and finance costs of either a 40-mile citywide monorail system or a single 10-mile monorail segment; and

 WHEREAS, the City's councilmanic debt capacity is insufficient to allow the City to borrow, without voter approval, the funds necessary to build either a 40-mile citywide monorail system or a single 10-mile monorail segment; and

 WHEREAS, voter-approved bonds and additional City taxes to repay those bonds would be required to pay most of the construction and finance costs of a either a 40-mile citywide monorail system or a single 10- mile monorail segment; and

 WHEREAS, on June 7, 2000, a ruling from King County Superior Court in Case No. 00-2-11207-6SEA directed that the City should exercise its discretion to either provide or propose to the electors additional funding for continued operation of the ETC toward the purpose of building and operating a monorail system within the City, or amend or repeal the initiative; and

 WHEREAS, an advisory ballot measure will provide valuable information about what type of monorail system City voters want and whether they are willing to pay additional taxes, and if so which additional taxes, to build either type of monorail system; NOW, THEREFORE,

 BE IT ORDAINED BY THE CITY OF SEATTLE AS FOLLOWS:

 Section 1. Advisory Ballot Measure. The King County Director of Records and Elections, as ex officio supervisor of elections, is hereby requested to call and conduct a special City election in conjunction with the state primary election on September 19, 2000, and submit to the qualified electors of the City the advisory ballot measure set forth below.

 The City Clerk is hereby authorized and directed to certify to the King County Director of Records and Elections the following text of an advisory ballot measure:

 MONORAIL ADVISORY

 In 1997, Seattle citizens passed an initiative seeking to build a monorail system. Construction has been estimated to cost $35 million to $90 million or more per mile. A 40-mile citywide system might cost $1.4 billion to $3.6 billion or more to build. A shorter segment (about 10 miles) might cost about $350 million to $900 million or more to build. The bulk of the money would probably have to come from new local taxes. Assuming a middle range of $40 million to $80 million per mile ($1.6 billion to $3.2 billion for a 40-mile system, and one- quarter of that for a single segment), which one of the following options would you most prefer?

 o No new monorail and no new taxes to build one.

 o To build a 40-mile citywide monorail system with business and occupation (B&O) taxes, more than double or triple (115% to 230% increase) the City's B&O tax rates to raise an additional $139 million to $279 million per year for 20 years.

 o To build a 40-mile citywide monorail system with property taxes, increase City property taxes by about 59% to 118% (about $570 to $1141 in additional taxes per year for the average home now valued at $262,000) for 20 years.

 o To build a single 10-mile monorail segment with business and occupation (B&O) taxes, increase the City's B&O tax rates by 29% to 58% to raise an additional $35 million to $70 million per year for 20 years.

 o To build a single 10-mile monorail segment with property taxes, increase City property taxes by about 15% to 29% for 20 years (about $143 to $285 in additional taxes per year for the average home now valued at $262,000).

 Section 2. Effective Date. This ordinance shall take effect and be in force immediately upon its approval by the Mayor or, if not approved and returned by the Mayor within ten (10) days after presentation, then on the eleventh (11th) day after its presentation to the Mayor or, if vetoed by the Mayor, then immediately after its passage over his veto.
