 ORDINANCE __________

 AN ORDINANCE relating to City of Seattle boards and commissions; establishing a pilot program to encourage participation by young adults on boards and commissions; adding a new chapter to the Seattle Municipal Code regarding the pilot program; adding a position designated for representation by a young adult to several specified boards and commissions as part of the pilot program; amending SMC Sections 3.14.920, 9.25.025, and 21.60.060, adding a new SMC Section 17.08.015, and amending certain City ordinances and resolutions to add a designated young adult position to several specified boards and commissions; and correcting obsolete references in connection herewith.

 WHEREAS, young adults ages 18-29 represent 23% of the adult Seattle Community and are interested in issues of City government; and,

 WHEREAS, very few of the more than 500 current members of the City's boards and commissions are young adults; and,

 WHEREAS the Mayor and City Council recognize young adults as an asset to the community and have been strong supporters of youth and young adult involvement in public policy and decision-making; and,

 WHEREAS, the City's boards and commissions cover a wide array of issues, have a real impact on public policy and City life, and are an effective method for young adult involvement in City government; and,

 WHEREAS, the YMCA of Greater Seattle, Metrocenter Branch, has received a grant from the Henry M. Jackson Foundation for a two- year project to promote public service careers in government called "Get Engaged: City Boards and Commissions"; and,

 WHEREAS, this program will serve as a catalyst to increase and sustain the involvement of young adults in the City government and will aim to meaningfully engage young adults in these roles on City boards and commissions so as to foster long-term citizen participation in the City government and to involve young adults in City policy making:

 NOW, THEREFORE,

 BE IT ORDAINED BY THE CITY OF SEATTLE AS FOLLOWS:

 Section 1. A new Chapter 3.51 is added to the Seattle Municipal Code as follows:

 SMC Chapter 3.51 Get Engaged: A Pilot Program to Encourage Young Adults to Participate on City Boards and Commissions.

 3.51.010 General. The City hereby establishes a two-year pilot program entitled "Get Engaged: City Boards and Commissions" ("Get Engaged") to encourage young adult participation on City of Seattle boards and commissions.

 3.51.020 Definitions. For the purposes of the Get Engaged program:

 A. "Designated young adult position" means a position added to a board or commission as part of the pilot program created by this ordinance.

 B. "Young adult" means an individual between the ages of 18 and 29.

 C. "Selected" young adult means nominated by the Mayor and confirmed by the City Council.

 3.51.030 First program year. During the first year of the pilot program, a designated young adult position will be created on each of approximately ten (10) City boards and commissions. To fill these positions, young adults shall be nominated by the Mayor and shall be subject to confirmation by the City Council by majority vote. The young adults selected as part of this pilot program will be full voting members of the boards and commissions on which they serve, unless specified otherwise for a particular board or commission. Nothing in this program precludes appointment of a young adult to other regular positions on any board or commission.

 Each young adult selected will be matched with a mentor who serves on the same board or commission, and will attend support groups and training tailored toward their duties as a board or commission member. At the end of the first year, all program participants will help assess the effectiveness of the program, and adjustments will be made based on this feedback before the selection of the second group of young adults.

 3.51.040 Second program year. During the second year of the program, a designated young adult position may be created on up to ten (10) additional boards and commissions. Selection of young adults to fill these new positions will be the same as for the first year of the program.

 In addition to the program elements listed in SMC 3.51.030, during the second program year, written materials will be developed for use by the program participants and by other jurisdictions who may want to establish or participate in a similar program. Participants in the Get Engaged program will provide feedback to assist the Get Engaged partners (Mayor's Office Boards and Commissions, City Council, and YMCA Metrocenter Branch) in developing a plan to sustain effective young adult involvement within City government.

 3.51.050 Terms and Vacancies. Young adults selected in the first year of the program will serve for one year with the possibility of being re-appointed to a board or commission for a second year. Young adults selected in the second year of the program year will serve for one year. Any young adult position vacancies that arise during the tenure of the pilot program will be filled following the same process used for the original selections.

 3.51.060 Effectiveness Report. Twelve (12) months after the effective date of this ordinance, the Mayor or his designee and representatives of the YMCA shall provide a report to the City Council regarding the effectiveness of the program so that the City may determine whether the program should be continued.
