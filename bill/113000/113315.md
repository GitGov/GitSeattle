 AN ORDINANCE relating to the criminal code, and amending Sections 12A.06.130, 12A.06.165, 12A.06.170, 12A.06.180 and 12A.18.010, adding a new Section to Chapter 12.18 and repealing Section 12A.06.310 of the Seattle Municipal Code.

 BE IT ORDAINED BY THE CITY OF SEATTLE AS FOLLOWS:

 Section 1. Section 12A.06.130 of the Seattle Municipal Code (Ordinance 108995 1 (12A.04.196), Ordinance 109674 5 (12A.06.130), as last amended by Ordinance 117673 2) is further amended as follows:

 12A.06.130 No contact orders.

 A. Because of the likelihood of repeated violence directed at those who have been victims of domestic violence in the past, when any person charged with a crime or arrested for a crime involving domestic violence is released from custody before arraignment or trial on bail or personal recognizance, or after trial before sentencing or as a condition of any sentence imposed, the court authorizing the release may prohibit that person from having any contact with the victim or from knowingly coming within, or knowingly remaining within, a specified distance of a location. At the time of arraignment, the court shall determine whether a no-contact order shall be issued or extended. In issuing the order, the court shall consider the provisions of Section 12A.06.195. The court may include in the conditions of release or as a condition of the sentence a requirement that the defendant submit to electronic monitoring. If electronic monitoring is ordered, the court shall specify who shall provide the monitoring services and the terms under which the monitoring shall be performed. ~~Upon conviction, the court may require as a condition of the sentence that the defendant pay for or reimburse the providing agency for the costs of the electronic monitoring. The court shall consider the ability of the convicted person to pay for electronic monitoring.~~ The no-contact order shall be issued in writing as soon as possible.

 B. Willful violation of a court order issued under this section, or of an order issued by any court of competent jurisdiction under an equivalent statute or ordinance, is punishable under Section 12A.06.180~~a gross misdemeanor~~. The written order releasing the person shall contain the court's directives and shall bear the legend: "Violation of this order is a criminal offense under Seattle Municipal Code Section 12A.06.180~~12A.06.130~~ and/or RCW Chapter 26.50~~10.99~~ and will subject a violator to arrest; any assault, drive-by shooting, or reckless endangerment that is a violation of this order is a felony. You can be arrested even if any person protected by the order invites or allows you to violate the order's prohibitions. You have the sole responsibility to avoid or refrain from violating the order's provisions. Only the court can change the order." A certified copy of such order shall be provided to the victim. If a no-contact order has been issued prior to charging, that order shall expire at arraignment or within seventy- two (72) hours if charges are not filed. The no-contact order shall terminate if the defendant is acquitted or the charges are dismissed.

C. Whenever a no-contact order~~an order prohibiting contact~~ is issued, modified, or terminated under this section, the clerk of the court shall forward a copy of the order on or before the next judicial day to the appropriate law enforcement agency specified in the order.

 Section 2. Subsections A and B of Section 12A.06.165 of the Seattle Municipal Code (Ordinance 111857 4, as last amended by Ordinance 117673 5) are further amended as follows:

 12A.06.165 Protection order-Relief.

 A. Upon notice and after hearing, the court may provide relief as follows:

 1. Restrain the respondent from committing acts of domestic violence;

 2. Exclude the respondent from the dwelling that~~which~~ the parties share, from the residence, workplace, or school of the petitioner, or from the daycare or school of a child;

 3. Prohibit the respondent from knowingly coming within, or knowingly remaining within, a specified distance from a specified location;  4.

 On the same basis as is provided in Chapter 26.09 RCW, the court shall make residential provision with regard to minor children of the parties. However, parenting plans as specified in Chapter 26.09 RCW shall not be required;

5.~~4.~~ Order the respondent to participate in a domestic violence perpetrator treatment program approved under RCW 26.50.150~~batterers' treatment~~;

6.~~5.~~ Order other relief as it deems necessary for the protection of the petitioner and other family or household members sought to be protected, including orders or directives to a peace officer;

7.~~6.~~ Require the respondent to pay the administrative court costs and service fees, as established by the City Council, and to reimburse the petitioner for costs incurred in bringing the action, including a reasonable attorney's fee;

8.~~7.~~ Restrain the respondent from having any contact with the victim of domestic violence or the victim's children or members of the victim's household;

9.~~8.~~ Require the respondent to submit to electronic monitoring. The order shall specify who shall provide the electronic monitoring services and the terms under which the monitoring must be performed. The order also may include a requirement that the respondent pay the costs of the monitoring. The court shall consider the ability of the respondent to pay for electronic monitoring;

 10.

~~9.~~ Consider the provisions of Section 12A.06.195;

11.~~10.~~ Order possession and use of essential personal effects. The court shall list the essential personal effects with sufficient specificity to make it clear which property is included; and

12.~~11.~~ Order use of a vehicle.

 B. If a protection~~restraining~~ order restrains the respondent from contacting the respondent's minor children, the restraint shall be for a fixed period not to exceed one (1) year. With regard to other relief, if the petitioner has petitioned for relief on his or her own behalf or on behalf of the petitioner's family or household members or minor children, and the court finds that the respondent is likely to resume acts of domestic violence against the petitioner or the petitioner's family or household members or minor children when the order expires, the court may either grant relief for a fixed period or enter a permanent order for protection. If the petitioner has petitioned for relief on behalf of the respondent's minor children, the court shall advise the petitioner that if the petitioner wants to continue protection for a period beyond one (1) year the petitioner may either petition for renewal pursuant to the provisions of this section or may seek relief pursuant to the provisions of Chapter 26.09 or 26.26 RCW.

 Section 3. Subsection A of Section 12A.06.170 of the Seattle Municipal Code (Ordinance 111857 5, as last amended by Ordinance 118107 4) is further amended as follows:

 12A.06.170 Ex parte temporary protection orders.

 A. Where an application under this section alleges that irreparable injury could result from domestic violence if an order is not issued immediately without prior notice to the respondent, the court may grant an ex parte temporary order for protection, pending a full hearing, and grant relief as the court deems proper, including an order:

 1. Restraining any party from committing acts of domestic violence;

 2. Restraining any party from going onto the grounds of or entering the dwelling that the parties share, from the residence, workplace or school of the other or from the day care or school of a child until further order of the court;

 3. Prohibiting any party from knowingly coming within, or knowingly remaining within, a specified distance from a specified location;  4.

5.~~4.~~ Restraining any party from having any contact with the victim of domestic violence or the victim's children or members of the victim's household;

6.~~5.~~ Considering the provisions of Section 12A.06.195.

 Section 4. Subsections A, B, C and D of Section 12A.06.180 of the Seattle Municipal Code (Ordinance 111857 7, as last amended by Ordinance 117673 8) are further amended and a new subsection G is added to this Section as follows:

 12A.06.180 ~~Protection order-~~ Violation-Penalty-Contempt.

 A. Whenever an order ~~for protection~~ is granted under this chapter, RCW Chapter 10.99, 26.09, 26.10, 26.26 or 74.34 or an equivalent ordinance by this court or any court of competent jurisdiction or there is a valid foreign protection order as defined in RCW 26.52.020 and the respondent or person to be restrained knows of the order, a violation of the restraint provisions, or of a provision excluding the person from a residence, workplace, school, or daycare, or of a provision prohibiting the person from knowingly coming within, or knowingly remaining within, a specified distance of a location, or of a provision of a foreign protection order specifically indicating that a violation will be a crime is a gross misdemeanor. Upon conviction, and in addition to any other penalties provided by law, the court may require that the convicted person submit to electronic monitoring. The court shall specify who shall provide the electronic monitoring services and the terms under which the monitoring shall be performed. The court may require that the convicted person pay the costs of the monitoring. The court shall consider the ability of the convicted person to pay for electronic monitoring.

 B. A peace officer shall arrest without a warrant and take into custody a person whom the peace officer has probable cause to believe has violated an order that restrains the person or excludes the person from a residence, workplace, school, or daycare or prohibits the person from knowingly coming within, or knowingly remaining within, a specified distance of a location, if the person restrained knows of the order. Presence of the order in the law enforcement computer-based criminal intelligence information system is not the only means of establishing knowledge of the order.

 C. A violation of an order issued under this chapter, RCW Chapter 10.99, 26.09, 26.10, 26.26 or 74.34 or an equivalent ordinance by this court or any court of competent jurisdiction or of a valid foreign protection order as defined in RCW 26.52.020~~for protection~~ shall also constitute contempt of court, and is subject to the penalties prescribed by law.

In addition, any person having actual notice of the existence of a restraining order issued by a court of competent jurisdiction under RCW 26.44.063 who refuses to comply with the provisions of such order is guilty of a misdemeanor. The notice requirement of the preceding sentence may be satisfied by a peace officer giving oral or written evidence to the person subject to the order by reading from or handing to that person a copy certified by a notary public or the clerk of the court to be an accurate copy of the original court order which is on file. The copy may be supplied by the court or any party.

 12A.18.290 Criminal Mistreatment.

 A. A person is guilty of criminal mistreatment if he or she is the parent of a child, a person entrusted with the physical custody of a child or other dependent person or a person employed to provide to a child or dependent person the basic necessities of life and, with criminal negligence, either causes substantial bodily harm or creates an imminent and substantial risk of substantial bodily harm to a child or dependent person by withholding any of the basic necessities of life.
