 AN ORDINANCE relating to Seattle Public Utilities, Seattle City Light and the Human Services Department; authorizing new rate assistance programs for low-income households that are not directly billed for any City utility services; and amending the Seattle Municipal Code in connection therewith.

 WHEREAS, the City of Seattle supports affordable housing efforts and providing assistance to low-income residents; and

 WHEREAS, SMC Chapter 20.76 authorizes a program of credits to partially offset billings for water, wastewater, drainage, and solid waste services for qualified low-income households, and sets forth the basis for qualification for, and the method of delivering, such credits; and

 WHEREAS, SMC 21.49.040 authorizes Seattle City Light to assist low-income households in paying for the cost of electricity by providing a credit on electric bills, but provides no assistance to otherwise eligible households that are not directly billed for electricity service; and

 WHEREAS, with regard to low-income households that are not directly billed for any utility service, the current City programs under SMC Chapter 21.49 and 21.76 are not designed to, or in practice do not, adequately provide utility low- income rate assistance; and

 WHEREAS, Ordinance 119530 established a pilot program to provide low-income rate assistance for electricity services to households that reside in buildings owned and operated by not- for-profit corporations and are not directly billed for any City utility service, but whose rent payments reflect the costs of such utility service; and

 WHEREAS, the pilot program resulted in rents for low income households that were three percent to eight percent less than they would have been without the credit; and

 WHEREAS, the City desires to make the pilot program an on- going method of providing utility rate assistance to low- income households; Now, Therefore,
