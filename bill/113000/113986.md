 WHEREAS, high demand general service customers have significant electric loads that, if subject to interruption, could provide significant flexibility to the City Light Department; and

 WHEREAS, certain high demand general service customers may be willing to enter into contracts providing the City Light Department with such an interruptible option, if those customers are provided a high degree of rate certainty over a defined period; and

 WHEREAS, the City Light Department may subsequently be able to enter into further interruptible options with such high demand general service customers that benefit the Department; Now Therefore,

Schedule HDI (High Demand General Service Interruptible)  Schedule HDI is available to customers that agree to enter into a contract acceptable to the Department providing for interruptible service . Such interruptible customers will be furnished service under the following conditions and rates:

 1. Conditions The Department may interrupt power deliveries to the customer when power supply conditions in the Pacific Northwest wholesale power market offer opportunities for both the customer and the Department to realize gain from interrupting power that the customer would otherwise have consumed. A "trigger price" for wholesale power shall be established defining the price that triggers the Department's option to interrupt. Net revenues above the defined trigger price received by means of such interruption shall be shared equally between the Department and the customer. The trigger price for calendar years 2002 and 2003 is established at $55 per megawatt hour. The Department is authorized to establish a new trigger price for each subsequent two-year period by written notification to those customers that have entered into an interruptible contract. For those customers that enter into such an interruptible contract, the provisions of Section 21.49.058(E) shall not apply, but the provisions of Sections 21.49.110(U) and 21.49.110(V) shall continue to apply.

 2. Rates For those high demand customers entering into an interruptible contract under this subsection, the following rates shall apply:

 a. January 1, 2002 through December 31, 2003

 Energy Charges:

 Peak: Energy used between six (6:00) a.m. and ten (10:00) p.m., Monday through Saturday, excluding major holidays,* at 4.00 cents per kWh

 Off-peak: Energy used at all times other than the peak period at 3.56 cents per kWh

 Bonneville Rate pass-through: Both the Peak and Off-peak energy rates contain a 0.6 cents per kWh component reflecting the Bonneville rate surcharge. This component will be automatically increased or decreased during the two-year rate period to reflect any change in the Bonneville surcharge.

 Demand Charges:

 Peak: All kW of maximum demand between six (6:00) a.m. and ten (10:00) p.m., Monday through Saturday, excluding major holidays,* at $0.40 per kW

 Off-peak: All kW of maximum demand in excess of peak maximum demand, at all times other than the peak period, at $0.17 per kW

 Discounts:

 Transformer losses in kWh -

 1756 + .53285 x kW + .00002 x kW2+ .00527 x kWh

 Transformer investment -

 $0.17 per kW of monthly maximum demand

 b. January 1, 2004

 Commencing January 1, 2004, the energy rate for such interruptible customers shall be standard high demand general service energy and demand charges for both Peak and Off-peak hours plus an additional "extraordinary power cost adjustment" in the amount of 0.725 cents per kWh in each period applied to all kWh consumed by the customer after December 31, 2003, until the customer has consumed a total of five times that customer's actual kWh consumption in calendar year 2000 (or such other calendar year from 1997 through 2001 that the Department determines to be representative of that customer's annual consumption), at which point the extraordinary power cost adjustment shall no longer be charged.

 3. Additional Interruptible Options In addition to the conditions and rates set out above, the Department is delegated the authority to enter into additional contract terms and payment provisions for a schedule HDI customer that provide further interruptible options and/or power scheduling improvements that benefit the Department.

 Schedule VRC (Variable Rate General Service)

 Schedule VRC is an optional rate schedule for high demand general service provided to customers eligible to be served under Schedule HDC. A customer that chooses this rate schedule may not return to a standard rate schedule for a period of one (1) year after electing this schedule, provided that, should a new rate ordinance which changes Schedule VRC be adopted during this time, the customer may request return to a standard rate schedule upon the effective date of the new ordinance.

 At the time a customer elects to take service under Schedule VRC, the customer must choose whether to pay an energy charge as defined in Option 1 - DJ-COB or Option 2 - DJ Mid-Columbia. After choosing an energy charge option, a customer may not choose a different energy charge option for a period of one (1) year except that, should a new rate ordinance which changes Schedule VRC be adopted during this time, the customer may request a change in energy charge option upon the effective date of the new ordinance or may request return to a standard rate schedule upon the effective date of the new ordinance.

 RATES EFFECTIVE MARCH 1, 2001:

 Energy Charge:

 Option 1 - DJ-COB

 (DJ-COB price in cents/kWh - 0.07 cents/kWh) x 1.1562 + 0.15 cents/kWh

 The DJ-COB (Dow Jones-California Oregon Border) price is the appropriate peak or off-peak DJ-COB firm price converted to cents per kWh for the day and time period of the consumption. Peak and off-peak periods will be as defined by the DJ-COB price rather than as defined in the Demand Charges section of Schedule VRC or elsewhere in the ordinance codified in this section. In the case that a price is not available for a given day, the average of the preceding and following days' prices will be used. Peak and off- peak prices will be calculated separately via this method.

 Option 2 - DJ Mid-Columbia

 DJ Mid-Columbia Price in cents/kWh x 1.1562 + 0.15 cents/kWh

 The DJ Mid-Columbia (Dow Jones Mid-Columbia) price is the appropriate firm peak or off-peak DJ Mid-Columbia price index converted to cents per kWh for the day and time period of the consumption. Peak and off-peak periods will be as defined by the DJ Mid-Columbia price index rather than as defined in the Demand Charges section of Schedule VRC or elsewhere in this section.

Peak and off- peak prices will be calculated separately via this method.

 Option 2 - DJ Mid-Columbia

 DJ Mid-Columbia Price in cents/kWh x 1.1562 + 0.15 cents/kWh

The DJ Mid-Columbia (Dow Jones Mid-Columbia) price is the appropriate firm peak or off-peak DJ Mid-Columbia price index converted to cents per kWh for the day and time period of the consumption.

 Transformer investment -

 $0.17 per kW of monthly maximum demand

 B. For customers metered on the primary side of a transformer, the Department will either program the meter to deduct computed transformer losses or provide a discount for transformer losses by reducing the monthly kWh billed by the number of kWh computed in Section 21.49.058 A.

 C. For customers who provide their own transformation from the Department's standard distribution system voltage of four (4) kV, thirteen (13) kV, or twenty-six (26) kV to a utilization voltage, a discount for transformer investment will be provided in the amount stated in Section 21.49.058 A. Existing customers served by the Department's 34.5 kV system as of January 1, 1995 shall be considered as receiving standard distribution voltage for the purpose of this section. This 34.5 kV voltage will not be offered as a standard distribution system voltage for any new customers.

 D. Customers must provide hourly load schedules each day for the following day. If a customer's load follows a regular pattern, the Department may, at its discretion, waive this requirement and request only to be informed of temporary or permanent changes to the pattern.

 E. The Department may request voluntary load interruption during an emergency. If interruption occurs, the demand charge will be waived for the billing period in which the interruption occurs.

 F. Customers who request service under Schedule VRC will be selected solely at the option of Seattle City Light.

 G. Customers served under Schedule VRC shall provide Seattle City Light with access to their telephone equipment and pay any initial and ongoing charges for additional telephone equipment needed for the Department to communicate with its metering equipment.

 Section 2. This ordinance shall take effect and be in force thirty (30) days from and after its approval by the Mayor, but if not approved and returned by the Mayor within ten (10) days after presentation, it shall take effect as provided by Municipal Code Section 1.04.020.
