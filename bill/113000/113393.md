 AN ORDINANCE relating to the Multifamily Property Tax Exemption Program, amending Seattle Municipal Code Chapter 5.72.030 to add Capitol Hill and Rainier Beach to the residential target areas eligible for property tax exemption, amending 5.72.040 to revise the criteria for project eligibility with respect to affordable units, and adding a new subsection 5.72.065 to establish a procedure and fee for the consideration of contract amendments requested by project applicants.

 WHEREAS, by Ordinance 119237, passed November 30, 1998, there was created a new Chapter 5.72 of the Seattle Municipal Code, implementing RCW Chapter 84.14 to provide for exemption from ad valorem property taxation for qualified multi-family housing in designated target areas within the City and designating certain areas a residential targeted areas; and

 WHEREAS, pursuant to Chapter 5.72 SMC, a committee composed of the designees of the Directors of the Office of Housing, the Strategic Planning Office, the Department of Construction and Land Use, City Budget Office, and Council Central reviewed the program and provided a report outlining development activity in the first year of the program and evaluating the effects of the program on housing production, housing affordability, and property tax revenues; and

 WHEREAS, the executive report on the annual review of the multifamily property tax exemption program contains recommendations for program amendments and the designation of additional residential targeted areas; and

 WHEREAS, the City Council solicited public comment regarding the additional residential target areas at a public hearing on September 27, 2000; and

 WHEREAS, the City finds that the additional areas designated as residential targeted areas in this Ordinance are each located within an urban village as defined in this ordinance; that each area lacks sufficient available, desirable and convenient residential housing to meet the needs of the public who would be likely to live in such area if desirable, attractive and livable residences were available, including the needs of low and moderate income households who would be likely to live in such areas if affordable residences were available; and that the property tax exemption program contained in Section 5.72 SMC, as amended by this Ordinance, will encourage increased residential opportunities within the City and stimulate the construction of new multifamily housing and the rehabilitation of existing vacant and underutilized buildings for multifamily housing; and maintain, to the extent possible, the stability of existing communities within multifamily buildings;

 NOW THEREFORE,

 2. The residential targeted area lacks sufficient available, desirable and convenient residential housing to meet the needs of the public who would be likely to live in the urban village if desirable, attractive and livable residences were available; and

 B. In designating a residential targeted area, the Council may also consider other factors, including:

 4. Whether encouraging additional housing in the residential targeted area is consistent with plans for LINK Light Rail by Sound Transit; or

 5. Whether additional housing may contribute to revitalization of a distressed neighborhood or area within the City.

 F. For any new construction project where an existing rental housing structure that contained four or more occupied dwelling units was demolished on the site of the new project within 12months prior to application for exemption under this chapter, or is to be demolished on that site for purposes of the new project, the owner shall agree, on terms and conditions satisfactory to the Director, to replace any units within such structure that were rented to tenants who receive a tenant relocation assistance payment under SMC Ch. 22.210, subject to the following requirements:

 (1) For the first ten calendar years of operation of the replacement units, the replacement units shall be affordable at or below 50% of median income.

 (2) Replacement may be accomplished either as part of the new construction for which application for exemption is made under this chapter, or through the new construction of additional multiple-unit housing at another location, or through the substantial rehabilitation of vacant multiple-unit housing, or through the preservation of housing that is rented at the time of application to tenants with household annual income at or below 50% of median income, and that the Director determines would otherwise be converted to a use other than rental to tenants with such income.

 (3) The replacement housing shall be completed, and a temporary or permanent certificate of occupancy shall be issued, within three years from the date of approval of the application, provided that the Director may extend the time for completion if the Director finds that: (i) the failure to complete the replacement housing is due to circumstances beyond the owner's control; (ii) the owner has been acting and may reasonably be expected to continue to act in good faith and with due diligence; and (iii) the replacement housing will be completed within a reasonable time.
