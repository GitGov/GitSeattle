 ORDINANCE _____________________

 AN ORDINANCE relating to land use and zoning, adding a new subsection "E" to Section 23.42.040, and amending Sections 23.76.006, 23.76.010, and 23.84.024 of the Seattle Municipal Code, to permit temporary facilities and uses necessary for the construction of the Sound Transit Link Light Rail system.

 WHEREAS, Sound Transit (formally known as the Central Puget Sound Regional Transit Authority) is proceeding to implement Sound Move, the ten year regional transit system plan approved by voters in November, 1996; and

 WHEREAS, Sound Move includes the Link electric light rail line connecting the cities of SeaTac, Tukwila and Seattle, which will provide numerous benefits to Seattle's residents, workers, and visitors, and which will help the City meet its Comprehensive Plan goals for dense, mixed use urban centers and urban villages connected by high-quality public transit; and

 WHEREAS, on November 18, 1999, the Sound Transit Board of Directors, of which two City of Seattle elected officials are members, approved the light rail alignment, station locations, and maintenance base location in the city; and

 WHEREAS, the City Council and Mayor have committed to work cooperatively with Sound Transit to ensure that the light rail system gets built cost effectively, and that it is sensitive to the needs and interests of the citizens of Seattle; and

 WHEREAS, Sound Transit will apply to the City of Seattle for permits for components of the light rail system, both within and outside of public rights of way, for temporary construction-related facilities and uses, and for permanent uses and facilities; and

 WHEREAS, currently, the City's Land Use Code (SMC Title 23) does not include an applicable category of use or facility that encompasses the construction-related uses and facilities needed to build the light rail system; and

 WHEREAS, the City Council wants to add such a category of use or facility to the Land Use Code to accommodate Sound Transit's Link light rail system;

 NOW THEREFORE, BE IT ORDAINED BY THE CITY OF SEATTLE

 AS FOLLOWS:

 Section 1. Section 23.42.040 of the Seattle Municipal Code, which Section was last amended by Ordinance 117263, is amended to add a new subsection "E", as follows:

 23.42.040 Temporary uses.

 The Director may grant, deny or condition applications for temporary use authorization for uses not otherwise permitted or not meeting development standards in the zone, which are in keeping with the spirit and purpose of the Land Use Code.

 E. Light rail transit facility construction. A temporary structure or use that supports the construction of a light rail transit facility may be authorized by the Director pursuant to a Master Use Permit if:

 1. The alignment, station locations, and maintenance base location of the light rail transit system has been approved by the City Council by ordinance or resolution;

 2. The temporary use or structure is authorized for only so long as is necessary to support construction of the light rail transit system;

 3. The applicant must submit plans for the establishment of temporary construction uses and facilities to the Director for approval. When reviewing the application, the Director shall consider the duration and severity of impacts, and the number and special needs of people and businesses exposed, such as frail, elderly, and special needs residents. Following review of proposed plans and measures to mitigate impacts of light rail transit facility construction, and prior to the issuance of any permits granting permission to establish construction facilities and uses, the Director may impose reasonable conditions to reduce construction impacts on surrounding businesses and residences, including but not limited to the following:

 a. Noise impacts will be governed by the Noise Control Ordinance (SMC 25.08) and off-site impacts associated with grading and drainage will be governed by the Stormwater, Grading and Drainage Ordinance (SMC 22.800 - 22.808).

 e. Local Businesses. The applicant must address measures to limit disruption of local business, including pedestrian and/or auto access to business, loss of customer activity, or other impacts due to protracted construction activity.

 f. Security. The applicant must address site security and undertake measures to ensure the site is secure at all times and to limit trespassing or the attraction of illegal activity to the surrounding neighborhood.

 g. Site Design. The construction site should be designed in a manner that minimizes pedestrian/vehicle conflicts and does not unnecessarily impede pedestrian mobility around the site and through adjoining neighborhoods. Measures should also be undertaken to ensure appropriate screening of materials storage and other construction activities from surrounding streets and properties.

 h. Public Information. Actions should be taken that will inform surrounding residents and businesses of construction activities taking place and their anticipated duration, including a 24-hour phone number to seek additional information or to report problems.

 i. Temporary structures must be constructed to withstand inclement weather conditions.

 j. Vibration. The applicant must consider measures to mitigate vibration impacts on surrounding residents and businesses.

 4. Site Restoration.

 a. The applicant must also agree, in writing, to submit a restoration plan to the Director for restoring areas occupied by temporary construction activities, uses or structures.

 b. The restoration plan must be submitted and approved prior to the applicant vacating the construction site and it must include proposals for cleaning, clearing, removing construction debris, grading, remediation of landscaping, and restoration of grade and drainage.

 c. Site restoration must generally be accomplished within 180 days of cessation of use of the site for construction uses and activities, unless otherwise agreed to between the applicant and the Director.

 d. The Director will approve plans for site restoration in accordance with mitigation plans authorized under this Section.

 5. A master use permit for a temporary structure or use that supports the construction of a light rail transit facility shall not be issued until the Director has received satisfactory evidence that the applicant has obtained sufficient funding (which might include a Full Funding Grant Agreement with a federal agency) to complete the work described in the master use permit application.
