 AN ORDINANCE relating to low-income elderly and handicapped housing; approving the sale by the Seattle Housing Authority of the Morrison Hotel, which was rehabilitated with the proceeds of the City's bonds issued pursuant to Ordinance 110124; appropriating for capital purposes the portion of sales proceeds to be remitted to the City and the remaining proceeds of the City's Low-income and Elderly and Handicapped Housing bonds, and earnings thereon; authorizing an amendment to the Housing Cooperation Agreement between the City and the Seattle Housing Authority approved by Ordinance 110433 and amended as approved by Ordinance 119424; and ratifying and confirming prior acts, all by a three-fourths vote of the City Council.

 WHEREAS, pursuant to Ordinance 110124 there was presented to the voters of The City of Seattle in November 1981, and the voters approved, a ballot proposition for issuance of general obligation bonds of the City in the amount of $48,170,000 ("Bonds") to finance low-income elderly and handicapped housing to be acquired and developed by the Housing Authority of the City of Seattle ("SHA"); and

 WHEREAS, the Cooperation Agreement between the City and SHA authorized by Ordinance 110433, dated March 26, 1982 and amended pursuant to Ordinance 119424 ("Cooperation Agreement") provided for the use of the proceeds of the Bonds and the ownership and operation of the housing acquired and developed with those proceeds; and

 WHEREAS, one of the projects financed with the Bonds was the Morrison Hotel, legally described in Exhibit A hereto ("Morrison"), the housing units in which were rehabilitated by SHA using Bond proceeds in 1984 and have been operated by SHA as housing for low- income elderly or handicapped persons; and

 WHEREAS, the SHA Board of Commissioners has found that the housing units in the Morrison are no longer feasible for SHA to operate according to the purposes set forth in Seattle Ordinance 110124; and

 WHEREAS, a task force established to study the Morrison and its operations recommended sale of the Morrison on terms that, insofar as practicable, would allow the Morrison housing units to continue to serve its current population; and

 WHEREAS, SHA has entered into a Purchase and Sale Agreement with the Downtown Emergency Service Center ("DESC") for sale of the Morrison; and

 WHEREAS, the Cooperation Agreement allows such housing units to be sold under certain conditions, subject to approval of the City by Ordinance; and

 WHEREAS, the sale of the Morrison to DESC will permit the financing of capital improvements to the Morrison through the use of low- income housing tax credits and enable the Morrison to provide long- term decent housing for the intended population, as well as provide resources to SHA to fund needed capital improvements to other housing financed with the Bonds, extending the useful life of such housing; and

 WHEREAS, there remains in the fund established for proceeds of the Bonds, and earnings thereon, a small amount that SHA proposes to use for capital improvements to other low-income elderly and handicapped housing projects; and

 WHEREAS, the sale of the Morrison will generate proceeds, a portion of which, representing the value of the residential portion of the building, is allocable to Bond funding and is to be remitted to the City for deposit in the Bond development fund; and

 WHEREAS, the City and SHA desire to amend the Cooperation Agreement to authorize the use of the remaining proceeds of the Bonds, and proceeds to be deposited to the Bond development fund, for capital purposes consistent with the intent of the original bond ordinance;

 NOW, THEREFORE,

 BE IT ORDAINED BY THE CITY OF SEATTLE AS FOLLOWS:

 Section 1. The City of Seattle finds (1) that it is no longer feasible for SHA to operate the housing units in the Morrison Hotel for the purposes of Ordinance 110124, and (2) that sale of the Morrison to the Downtown Emergency Service Center would further the purpose of Ordinance 110124 by increasing the supply of housing for low-income elderly or handicapped persons, provided the sale is subject to the terms and conditions set forth in Exhibit B to this ordinance, and that SHA commits to use the sales proceeds consistent with Exhibit C to this ordinance.

 Section 2. The City Council hereby approves sale of the Morrison subject to the terms and conditions set forth in Exhibit B and to the execution and delivery by SHA of an amendment to the Cooperation Agreement as authorized in Section 3 of this ordinance. Proceeds of the sale attributable to the residential portion of the Morrison shall be remitted to the City for deposit in the fund described in Section 4 of this ordinance. Upon completion of the sale, SHA shall have no further responsibility for the Morrison with respect to the bond program authorized by Ordinance 110124.

 Section 3. The Mayor or Director of Housing is authorized to execute, deliver, and perform, for and on behalf of The City of Seattle, an amendment to the Cooperation Agreement in the form attached to this ordinance as Exhibit C, with any modifications and additions that the Mayor or such Director shall determine are necessary or appropriate to implement the intent of this Ordinance.

 Section 4. There is hereby appropriated from the Low-Income Elderly and Handicapped Housing Development Fund established by Section 5 of Ordinance 110124 (Fund 33010), from (1) the portion of proceeds of sale of the Morrison remitted to the City pursuant to Section 2 of this ordinance and any interest thereon, and (2) any remaining proceeds of the Bonds and interest thereon, the amount of up to EIGHT HUNDRED FIFTY-NINE THOUSAND NINE HUNDRED DOLLARS ($859,900.00), for the purposes described in Sections 3 and 4 of Exhibit C to this ordinance. After execution and delivery by the City and SHA of the Amendment to Cooperation Agreement authorized by Section 3 of this ordinance, the director of Housing is authorized to approve disbursements of such funds upon application of SHA. The unexpended balance of the appropriation in this section shall carry forward from year to year unless expressly abandoned by ordinance. The Office of Housing shall report to the Housing, Human Services, Education and Civil Rights Committee by September 1 of every year, regarding the unexpended balance of funds. Any unencumbered and unexpended balance of the appropriation made by Ordinance 119424 is hereby abandoned.

 Section 5. Any action pursuant to the authority and prior to the effective date of this ordinance is hereby ratified and confirmed.

 Section 6. The foregoing appropriation is made to meet actual necessary expenditures of the City for which insufficient appropriation has been made due to causes which could not reasonably have been foreseen at the time of the adoption of the 2001 budget; therefore, in accordance with RCW 35.32A, by reason of the facts above stated, this Ordinance shall take effect and be in force thirty (30) days from and after its approval by the Mayor, but if not approved and returned by the Mayor within ten (10) days after presentation, it shall take effect as provided by Municipal Code Section 1.04.020.

Exhibit C SECOND AMENDMENT TO HOUSING COOPERATION AGREEMENT BETWEEN THE CITY OF SEATTLE AND THE HOUSING AUTHORITY OF THE CITY OF SEATTLE

 (Low-Income Elderly and Handicapped Housing)

 This Amendment modifies the Housing Cooperation Agreement between THE CITY OF SEATTLE ("City"), a Washington municipal corporation, and the HOUSING AUTHORITY OF THE CITY OF SEATTLE ("Housing Authority"), a Washington public body corporate and politic, dated March 26, 1982, relating to the dwelling units developed for Low- income Elderly and Handicapped Persons with proceeds of the City's bonds issued pursuant to City Ordinance 110124. The Housing Cooperation Agreement was authorized by Ordinance 110433 and previously modified pursuant to Ordinance 119424, by an amendment dated as of July 15, 1999 (as so amended, it is referred to herein as the "Cooperation Agreement"). The Housing Authority's program for the development and operation of those units is referred to as the Seattle Senior Housing Program ("SSHP").

 RECITALS

 Pursuant to Ordinance 110124 there was presented to the voters of The City of Seattle in November 1981, and the voters approved, a ballot proposition for the issuance of general obligation bonds of the City in the amount of $48,170,000 ("Bonds") to finance low- income elderly and handicapped housing to be acquired and developed by the Housing Authority of the City of Seattle.

 Since passage of Ordinance 110124 and execution of the original Housing Cooperation Agreement the Housing Authority has, with the proceeds of the Bonds, acquired and developed over 1200 dwelling units for low income elderly and handicapped residents of Seattle.

 One of the projects financed with the Bonds was the Morrison Hotel, legally described in Exhibit A hereto ("Morrison"), the housing units in which were rehabilitated by the Housing Authority using Bond proceeds in 1984 and since operated by the Housing Authority as housing for low-income elderly or handicapped persons. However, the Morrison is need of significant further rehabilitation.

 The Housing Authority and City have both concluded that it is no longer feasible for the Housing Authority to operate the housing units in the Morrison consistent with Ordinance 110124 and the Cooperation Agreement, and have agreed that the Morrison be sold on terms which will enable the housing at the Morrison to be improved with financing that would not be available to the Housing Authority, so that such housing will effectively serve the intended population, and which will generate proceeds that will enable the improvement and the extension of the useful life of other properties in the SSHP program.

 The City has requested, and the Housing Authority has agreed, to sell the Morrison to Downtown Emergency Services Center ("DESC"), a non-profit Washington corporation qualified as a charitable organization under Section 501 (c)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code. DESC provides shelter and social services to low income persons. The sales price is $1,500,000, which is significantly below its current assessed value. DESC will take title to the Morrison subject to a restriction that the property be used to provide housing to very low- income elderly or disabled persons for at least fifty more years.

 The Housing Authority and the City have therefore concluded that this sale will further the purposes of the Ordinance 110124 by increasing the supply of housing for low-income elderly or handicapped persons. The City Council has authorized the sale, subject to specified conditions, by the Ordinance referred to at the end of this Amendment.

 There remains in the Development Fund established for proceeds of the Bonds, and earnings thereon, a small amount that the Housing Authority proposes to use for capital improvements to other low- income elderly and handicapped housing projects.

 The City and the Housing Authority wish to amend the Cooperation Agreement in order to facilitate the Housing Authority's access to and use of capital funds remaining in or deposited to the Development Fund.

 NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the mutual covenants herein, the parties hereby agree as follows:

 1. Morrison Hotel. Subsequent to sale of the Morrison as approved by the City, the Housing Authority shall have no further responsibility for the Morrison with respect to the bond program authorized by Ordinance 110124. From and after such sale, the Morrison shall not be part of the SSHP; shall not be subject to the Cooperation Agreement; and shall not be subject to the policies promulgated by the Housing Authority thereunder. The operations and finances of the Morrison shall be independent of the operations and finances of the operations of the remaining SSHP buildings. The Housing Authority hereby assigns to the City any rights that it may have to control or restrict the use of the Morrison under the terms of the sale and under any covenants or agreements now existing or hereafter made or entered into in connection with such sale, but not including any rights of the Housing Authority under or connected with any rent subsidies provided by or through the Housing Authority.

 2. Proceeds of Sale of Morrison. By agreement of the parties, the purchase price of the Morrison has been allocated to land, residential space, and non-residential space. The portion of the purchase price allocable to the residential space, which the parties agree is $598,900 out of the total sale price of $1,500,000 (not including assumption of debt or deduction of property reserves), shall be remitted to the City for deposit in the Development Fund, as provided in Section 3.E. of Ordinance 110124. The amount of $598,900 is deemed to represent the fair market value of the residential portion of the Morrison in light of the fifty- year restriction on use and in light of its physical condition. The remaining proceeds from sale of the Morrison shall be retained by the Housing Authority in a reserve for the SSHP program, and such money, together with earnings thereon, shall be used solely for repairs, maintenance, and improvements to the housing operated by the Housing Authority under the bond program authorized by Ordinance 110124.

 3. Use of Proceeds Deposited in Development Fund.

 A. The Director of the City Office of Housing ("Director") shall authorize disbursement to the Housing Authority of the portion of the proceeds of the Morrison deposited in the Development Fund, for Capital Costs eligible under Ordinance 110124 ("Capital Costs") upon the request of the Housing Authority. This disbursement from the Development Fund shall take place within ten (10) working days following execution by both parties of this Amendment, or ten (10) working days after the receipt of such portion of the proceeds of sale by the City, whichever is later. The Housing Authority shall maintain a separate restricted account for such proceeds, to be used only for authorized Capital Costs of rehabilitation of SSHP housing owned by the Housing Authority, and periodically credit accrued interest to the account.

 B. The Housing Authority's lists of capital improvements that may be funded by such proceeds are attached hereto as Exhibits B-1 and B-2. The Housing Authority represents and warrants that it has identified eligible capital improvements to buildings in the SSHP program, as shown on Exhibits B-1 and B-2, and in addition to those to be funded under Section 4 below, for which the Housing Authority reasonably expects to incur costs within two years. The Director has reviewed these proposed capital improvements and agrees that they qualify as Capital Costs, subject to review of appropriate documentation. Specific projects listed in Exhibits B-1 and B-2 may be changed at the request of the Housing Authority with the approval of the Director.

 C. The Housing Authority shall proceed with due diligence to spend the funds to pay for authorized Capital Costs, and shall, in writing, within thirty (30) days after the end of each six-month period ended March 31 or September 30, (1) report to the City the dates and amounts of such expenditures and provide copies of receipts for such expenditures for such period, (2) certify to the City that the expenditures were consistent with the same requirements of Ordinance 110124 that applied to proceeds of the original Bonds, (3) report the dates and amounts of all investment receipts for such period, and (4) report the cumulative amounts expended under this Section 3 and the remaining balance. All expenditures from, or reimbursed by, the Housing Authority's restricted account shall be subject to audit by or under the direction of the City. The Housing Authority shall reimburse the City upon demand for any amounts determined upon audit to have been expended from, or reimbursed by, the restricted account, in excess of documented Capital Costs (excluding any Capital Costs paid from actual Bond proceeds and earnings thereon), provided that the Housing Authority may, by written notice to the City within thirty (30) days of the Housing Authority's receipt of notice of any such determination, which notice shall include documentation satisfactory to the City, substitute for any expenditures found to be ineligible, other eligible Capital Costs upon which the Housing Authority shall have expended, prior to the earlier of October 1, 2003 or 2 years from the date of sale of the Morrison, money from other sources that could have been applied to such ineligible costs.

 D. If by the earlier of October 1, 2003 or 2 years from the date of sale of the Morrison, all of the amounts transferred to the Housing Authority restricted account and investment earnings thereon have not been spent in a manner to qualify for one of the spending exceptions to the arbitrage rebate requirement, the Housing Authority at its sole cost and expense will cause to be calculated and paid to the United States of America on behalf of the City the rebate amount, if any, due and payable with respect to those amounts. On or after the earlier of October 1, 2003 or 2 years from the date of sale of the Morrison, the City may demand, and the Housing Authority shall immediately pay to the City, any amounts that were transferred to the Housing Authority under this Section 3, and any earnings on amounts so transferred, that have not then been expended for Capital Costs consistent with this Section 3. The City shall deposit any such payment in the Redemption Fund.

 E. The Housing Authority acknowledges that a purpose of the requirements of this Section 3 is to effectuate a "remedial action" with respect to the Bonds in accordance with Treasury Regulations Section 1.141-12, in order to ensure that the disposition of the Morrison does not have any adverse effect under the Internal Revenue Code and applicable regulations thereunder. The Housing Authority shall indemnify the City for any and all loss, damage or expense resulting from any failure by the Housing Authority to expend, or misapplication of, funds provided to the Housing Authority under this Section 3 or earnings thereon.

 4. Use of Remaining Bond Funds. Subject to the terms of this Section, all funds remaining in the Development Fund prior to deposit of the Morrison proceeds, and any earnings thereon, shall be available for disbursement to pay, or reimburse the Housing Authority for, documented Capital Costs eligible for use of such funds under applicable law and incurred by the Housing Authority for the buildings owned by the Housing Authority that were previously constructed, acquired or rehabilitated by the Housing Authority for the SSHP. The Housing Authority shall submit to the Director one or more signed contracts for eligible improvements no later than April 1, 2002. After approval by the Director of the work contemplated by such contract(s), the Housing Authority may submit to the Director payment draws for contracted work, up to the full amount of the contract, which draws shall specify that they are for remaining bond funds under this Section. The Director shall approve such draws upon receipt of satisfactory documentation of the work performed, and upon such approval the Director shall forward them to the Finance Director for payment. Any amount remaining in the Development Fund as of April 1, 2002, that is in excess of the total amounts remaining unpaid on contracts for work approved by the Director under this Section, may be transferred to the Redemption Fund in the discretion of the Director.

 5. Conflicting Provisions. Sections 3 and 4 of this Second Amendment shall supersede existing provisions of the Cooperation Agreement to the extent of any conflict.

 6. Rescission of Prior Provisions. Section 6 of that Amendment to the Housing Cooperation Agreement dated July 15, 1999 is hereby rescinded and has no further force and effect.

 7. Miscellaneous. Except as expressly set forth above, the terms of the Cooperation Agreement remain in full force and effect. No waiver or modification of the terms of the Cooperation Agreement, as amended, is or shall be valid unless in writing and signed by a duly authorized officer of each party hereto. The City and the Housing Authority each represents and warrants to the other that this Amendment has been duly authorized by all necessary action of its governing body. This Amendment may be executed in two or more counterparts, which together shall constitute a single agreement. Capitalized terms not defined herein shall have the meanings set forth in the Cooperation Agreement unless the context otherwise requires.
