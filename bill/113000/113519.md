 AN ORDINANCE providing for the improvement of the property between Alki Avenue SW and Sunset Avenue SW, to be known as the Alki Landslide Mitigation Pilot Project, by constructing drainage improvements, including doing such grading or regrading as may be necessary, providing for surface or underground drainage, and by doing other such work as may be necessary, all in accord with Resolution 30153 of the City Council of Seattle; creating Local Improvement Fund District #6749; providing for payment of the cost and expense of the improvement by special assessments upon property within the district, and authorizing financing of a portion of the costs of the improvement by interfund transfers, all by a two- thirds vote of all the members of the City Council.

 WHEREAS, In 1997, the City of Seattle through the Seattle Public Utilities (SPU) secured a $1,312,500 grant from the Federal Emergency Management Agency to mitigate potential landslide damage at a selected site in the vicinity of the Duwamish Head. SPU chose the area between Sunset Avenue SW and Alki Avenue SW, and roughly between SW Atlantic Street and SW Holgate Street to construct drainage facilities to help stabilize the site. When the Council accepted the grant funds, they also directed SPU to provide an opportunity for affected property owners to participate in a $350,000 Challenge Grant/Local Improvement District; and

 WHEREAS, The City's contribution shall be at least equal to the amount assessed against the property owners; and

 WHEREAS, This project attempts to improve the stability of the bench portion of the site, which is intended to improve the stability of the upper and lower portions of the project area;

 NOW THEREFORE,

 BE IT ORDAINED BY THE CITY OF SEATTLE AS FOLLOWS:

 Section 1. All that portion of the Northwest One Quarter of Section 11, Township 24 North, Range 3 East, Willamette Meridian; described as follows:

 That property bounded on the northwesterly side by the centerline of Alki Avenue Southwest. And on the southeasterly and easterly side by the centerline of Sunset Avenue Southwest. And also Bounded on the southwesterly side by the following described line:

 Beginning at the intersection of the centerline of Sunset Avenue Southwest and the centerline of 48th Avenue Southwest as vacated by City of Seattle Vacation Ordinance 95596; thence westerly along the centerline of vacated 48th Avenue Southwest to the northwesterly line of Replat of Blocks 8, 16, 17, 22, 23 and 24 of West Seattle Park, as recorded in Volume 12 of Plats, page 49, Records of King County, Washington; thence continuing along the production northwesterly of said centerline to the southeasterly line of Bon Aire Drive Southwest; thence along a straight line to the southeasterly corner of Tract, (lot) 16; Alki Beach Addition (Unrecorded); thence along the southwesterly line of said Tract and its production northwesterly to the centerline of Alki Avenue Southwest and the end of this described line.

 And also bounded on the northeasterly side by the following described line: Beginning at a point on the centerline of Sunset Avenue Southwest, said point being on the production southeasterly of the northeasterly line of Lot 10, Block 45, Second Plat of West Seattle by the West Seattle Land and Improvement Company, according to Plat thereof recorded in Volume 3 of Plats, page 53, Records of King County Washington; thence along the northeasterly line of said production and lot line to the northwesterly corner of said Lot; thence along a straight line to the northeasterly corner of Lot 1; Block 1, King Addition, according to the Plat thereof recorded in Volume 40 of Plats, Page 47, Records of King County, Washington; thence northwesterly along the northeasterly line of said Lot and its production northwesterly to the centerline of Alki Avenue Southwest and the end of this described line.

 Said boundary encompassing the following addresses: 1396 Alki Avenue SW to 1706 Alki Avenue SW and 1521 Sunset Avenue SW to 1751 Sunset Avenue SW; shall be improved by constructing drainage improvements, including doing such grading or regrading as may be necessary, providing for surface or underground drainage to attempt to improve the stability of the bench portion of the site which is intended to improve the stability of the upper and lower portions of the project area, and by doing other such work as may be necessary, all in accordance with plans to be prepared by the Director, Seattle Public Utilities. Erosion and sloughing from the face of the lower bluff will continue to occur.

 Section 2. The estimated cost of the improvement is Two Million Nine Hundred Thousand Dollars ($2,900,000). The City intends to contribute Two Million, Five Hundred Fifty Thousand Dollars ($2,550,000) of the cost of this improvement, to be paid with a combination of Federal Emergency Management Agency grant funds of One Million, Three Hundred Twelve Thousand, Five Hundred Dollars ($1,312,500) and City challenge grant funds of One Million, Two Hundred Thirty-Seven Thousand, Five Hundred Dollars ($1,237,500). The remainder of the cost and expense of the improvement, not to exceed Three Hundred Fifty Thousand Dollars ($350,000), shall be borne by and assessed against the properties within the district.

 Section 3. There is hereby established a local improvement district, payable by the mode of payment by bonds, to be known as "Local Improvement District No. 6749," and there is hereby created and established in the City Treasury a special fund, entitled "Local Improvement Fund, District No. 6749."

 Section 4. For interim financing, the City authorizes a loan of funds from the Cumulative Reserve Subfund to the Local Improvement Fund, District No. 6749, for a period beginning with the effective date of this ordinance and terminating not later than the earlier of December 31, 2001, or upon obtaining long-term financing for the LID. Because the amount to be assessed against the properties within this LID is less than the total cost of the improvement, the Local Improvement Fund, District No. 6749 shall only be used to account for the amount to be assessed against the property owners and shall not be used for other project funds, notwithstanding the provisions of SMC 20.04.145. Funds in the Local Improvement Fund, District No. 6749 may be transferred to the Drainage and Wastewater Fund for purposes of financing a portion of the cost and expense of the improvements contemplated in Section 1 of this ordinance.

 Section 5. To finance the cost and expense of the improvements contemplated in Section 1 of this ordinance, which shall be borne by and assessed against the property within the district, the City may issue local improvement district bonds, as authorized by RCW 35.45, or in the alternative, consolidated local improvement district bonds, as authorized by RCW 35.45.160 or interfund notes as authorized by RCW 35.45.150. The Finance Director may, in his discretion, issue and purchase interfund notes pursuant to Sections 20.04.145 and 5.06.030 of the Seattle Municipal Code. If bonds are to be sold, they shall be in such form, contain such covenants, bear such date or dates, and shall be issued in such amounts and at such times or from time to time as the City Council may direct. Such bonds or notes shall be redeemed by the collection of special assessments to be levied upon the property within said district, payable in ten (10) equal annual installments, with interest, or in the alternative, in ten (10) equal annual installments of principal and interest, as the City Council may direct.

 The interest on the assessments shall be set equal to the true interest cost on the bonds or notes, calculated on the estimated maturities of the bonds or notes, rounded to the next highest tenth of one percent.

 In addition, in the event that an installment payment is delinquent, it shall, until paid, be subject to an additional charge of twenty percent (20%) levied upon the principal and interest due on such installment. Interest on delinquent payment, including penalties, shall continue to be applied until the payment is made.

 Section 6. The City Finance Director is authorized to sell short- term obligations, as authorized by Chapter 39.50 RCW, warrants as authorized by RCW 35.45.130, or installment notes as authorized by RCW 35.45.150 (together, "short-term obligations"), up to a maximum of Three Hundred Fifty Thousand Dollars ($350,000) outstanding at any time, to provide interim financing for the improvement authorized in Section 1 of this ordinance. Such obligations may bear a fixed rate or variable rate or rates of interest, the variable rate being fixed as a percentage of the most recent prime rate of interest published in the Wall Street Journal before the date of their issuance, but the net effective interest rate shall not exceed five and one half percent (5.5%) per annum. The short- term obligations shall be dated as of their date of issuance.

 The short-term obligations may be paid from the proceeds of local improvement district bonds, from assessment payments, from the proceeds of the issuance of other short-term obligations, or from other City funds made available for that purpose. The short-term obligations shall be drawn on Local Improvement Fund, District No. 6749, and shall be payable solely out of that fund or the Local Improvement Guaranty Fund.

 The short-term obligations shall be sold in such manner as the City Finance Director, upon the advice of the Debt Management Policy Advisory Committee, may determine. The short-term obligations may be subject to prior redemption, shall be sold at a price of no less than ninety seven percent (97%) of par value, may provide for registration of principal or principal and interest, may carry coupons and/or be sold at discount, shall be in such denominations, and bear such other covenants as the City Finance Director, upon the advice of the Debt Management Policy Advisory Committee, may determine.

 Both principal of and interest on the short-term obligations shall be payable in lawful money of the United States at The City of Seattle Executive Services, Finance Division in Seattle, Washington.

 The City Council finds and considers that the maximum rate of interest and the standard or index for the variable interest rates established in this section are in the best interests of the City.

 Section 7. The collection of any assessment levied by this local improvement district may be deferred pursuant to Seattle Municipal Code Chapter 20.12 and R.C.W. 35.43.250.

 Section 8. The City further authorizes and directs the Finance Director to charge interest to the Local Improvement Fund, District No. 6749, at the rate of return applied to participating funds in the City's Consolidated Cash Portfolio, for the period of the loan.

 Section 9. This ordinance shall take effect and be in force thirty (30) days from and after its approval by the Mayor, but if not approved and returned by the Mayor within ten (10) days after presentation, it shall take effect as provided by Municipal Code Section 1.04.020.
