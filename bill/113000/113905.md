 SETTLEMENT AGREEMENT AND RELEASE

 between

 The City of Seattle

 and

 The Muckleshoot Indian Tribe

 This Settlement Agreement and Release ("Agreement") is made and entered into by and between the Muckleshoot Indian Tribe, a federally recognized Indian tribe, (hereinafter the "Tribe") and the City of Seattle, a municipality of the State of Washington, (hereinafter the "City"). The City and the Tribe are hereinafter referred to jointly in this Agreement as the "Parties."

 R E C I T A L S

 A. The United States Navy identified the Naval Station Puget Sound at Sand Point for closure in 1991 with a scheduled departure date of September, 1995. The Sand Point Naval Station Property includes 151 acres of real and related personal property which was processed as excess property by the United States Navy. Adjacent to the Sand Point Naval Station Property is approximately eleven (11) acres of real property formerly held by the Department of Commerce, National Atmospheric and Oceanic Administration that was processed as excess property by the United States General Services Administration. Both of said properties are hereinafter referred to jointly as the "Sand Point Property." The Sand Point Property is located in Seattle, Washington.

 B. The United States Navy requested that the City sponsor a local reuse planning effort to determine how the Sand Point Naval Station Property should be reused by the community following base closure. The Seattle City Council adopted the City's Community Preferred Reuse Plan for Sand Point in November of 1993, which contemplated transfer of the Sand Point Property to the City, NOAA and the United States Department of Interior, National Biological Service.

 C. The Tribe developed and submitted a proposal to the U.S. Department of the Interior, Bureau of Indian Affairs ("BIA") requesting that the BIA submit a request for transfer of approximately 85 acres of the Sand Point Property to the BIA to hold in trust for the Tribe. The BIA submitted its request to the Navy for approximately 85 acres of the Sand Point Property, as excess property, for the benefit of the Tribe. The Tribe asserts that pursuant to federal law, the request for the Sand Point Property should receive priority over state and local government requests.

 D. The Federal government expressed its preference that a local agreement be reached regarding these alternate proposals for future uses of the Sand Point Property.

 E. The City and the Tribe have reached an agreement, as set forth herein, which represents a full settlement and discharge of all claims or potential claims of the Tribe to the Sand Point Property, whether based on federal law, treaty rights, or otherwise.

 A G R E E M E N T

 NOW, THEREFORE, the Parties agree as follows:

 SECTION 1.0 OBLIGATIONS OF THE TRIBE

 1.1 The Tribe hereby completely and forever waives and relinquishes its claim or right, if any, to receive title, or have the United States hold title in trust for the Tribe, to the Sand Point Property or any portion thereof, whether based on federal law, treaty rights or otherwise. This release does not affect any right the Tribe may have under the Treaty of Point Elliott (12 Stat. 927), for physical access to Lake Washington. This waiver and release expressly includes waiver of the Tribe's claim that the Sand Point Property should be transferred to the United States Department of the Interior, to be held in trust for the benefit of the Tribe.

 1.2 The parties understand and agree that the City does not have any intention whatsoever to sell or transfer any of the Sand Point Property at any time in the future. The Tribe does not waive its right, if any, to offer to purchase at fair market value any of the Sand Point Property at some future date should the City offer such property for sale.

 1.3 The Tribe covenants not to sue or to take any other civil or administrative action against the City or any Federal agency regarding transfer of the Sand Point Property.

 SECTION 2.0 OBLIGATIONS OF THE CITY

 2.1 The City shall diligently seek the transfer of Parcel X (described in Exhibit A) to the City from the Washington State Department of Transportation. The City shall then transfer Property X to the Tribe if the Tribe so requests within six months after the City gives notice to the Tribe of acquisition by the City. If the City is unable to obtain Parcel X, the parties shall negotiate a mutually-acceptable alternative.

 2.2 The City recognizes the Tribe's need for additional space in the area of the boat ramp near the First Avenue South Bridge for parking, storage, and other purposes related to the tribal fishery. The City shall diligently seek the longest-term lease available, not less than 10 years with 50-99 years preferable, from the Washington State Department of Transportation for land under the First Avenue South Bridge (described in Exhibit B) in order to provide for tribal activities not inconsistent with state law. The City shall then assign or otherwise transfer, with appropriate provisions for indemnification, such lease to the Tribe. The City shall retain access rights to the parcel for the maintenance and repair of the City's adjacent utilidor. The Tribe shall accept maintenance responsibility for the parcel during the lease term. If the City is unable to obtain the lease parcel, the parties shall negotiate a mutually-acceptable alternative.

 2.3 The City shall improve the public boat ramp near the First Avenue South Bridge, consistent with environmental and regulatory constraints, by extending the ramp, filling with gravel at the bottom end of the ramp, and by pressure-washing the ramp and otherwise maintaining the ramp as appropriate. The City shall take such action as necessary to insure that the ramp will remain permanently open for public and tribal motorized boat access.

 2.4 The City is committed to using its best efforts toward achieving the transfer to the Tribe of the Silver Bay parcel (identified on Exhibit C).

 2.5 The City recognizes the Tribe's need to establish appropriate tribal fishing access to Lake Washington. With respect to access at the Atlantic City boat ramp, the City shall negotiate with the Tribe to reach an agreement, consistent with other public uses not preempted by federal law, that will assure: access; parking for vehicles used by the tribal fishers, including trailers, and vehicles used by visitors; non-interference with sales; ability to anchor; satisfactory health conditions; and such other matters as may be appropriate to implement tribal fisheries. With respect to the north end of Lake Washington, the City shall use its best efforts, based on information received from the Tribe, to assist the Tribe in establishing access and moorage, in Kenmore or at other suitable sites, necessary for tribal fisheries.

 2.6 The City shall provide a modular building, approximately 40 feet by 24 feet in size, with appropriate set-up and utility hook- ups, for tribal office and storage space at the First Avenue South boat ramp or other suitable location.

 2.7 The parties agree to explore internships with the City for tribal members and employees; internships provided by the City with the Native American Water Association for tribal members and employees; and exchanges of employees between the City and the Tribe.

 2.8 The City commits to working in cooperation with the Tribe in order to achieve salmon recovery in the Cedar River-Lake Washington system that will benefit the tribal fishery. Seattle Public Utilities, in a manner determined by the Tribe and its state and federal co-managers in consultation with Seattle Public Utilities biologists, shall make a commitment of $400,000 for salmon recovery in order to benefit the tribal fishery. $200,000 or more of such funds shall be allocated to construction and the balance shall be paid out so that all funds are expended within five years.

 2.9 The City shall pay the Tribe $2 million plus interest from January 1, 2002 at the annual rate of 5.8% on any unpaid amounts. Payments shall be made on the following schedule:

 January 1, 2002 $500,000

 January 1, 2003 $587,000

 January 1, 2004 $558,000

 January 1, 2005 $529,000

 There shall be no penalty for prepayment. If the City elects to pay all or any of the principal before a due date, applicable interest shall be payable only to the date of such prepayment.

 SECTION 3.0 DISPUTE RESOLUTION

 The Parties shall make their best efforts to resolve disputes as expeditiously as possible through negotiations. If such negotiations fail to resolve the dispute, then either party may refer the dispute to non-binding mediation of the dispute, and the other party will participate in good faith in the mediation process.

 SECTION 4.0 WAIVER OF SOVEREIGN IMMUNITY

 The Tribe hereby expressly waives its sovereign immunity from suit in the United States District Court for the Western District of Washington concerning disputes regarding interpretation or enforcement of this Agreement. The Tribe consents to the jurisdiction of the United States District Court for the Western District of Washington for these purposes.
