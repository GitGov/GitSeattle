 MEMORANDUM OF AGREEMENT

 Between

 THE CITY OF SEATTLE DEPARTMENT OF PARKS AND RECREATION

 and

 GROUNDSWELL OFF BROADWAY

 and

 FRIENDS OF SEATTLE'S OLMSTED PARKS

 This Memorandum of Agreement ("MOA") is dated _____________, 2001, and is entered into by and between the City of Seattle ("City") a first class city of the State of Washington, acting by and through its Superintendent of the Seattle Department of Parks and Recreation ("Department"), and Groundswell Off Broadway ("Groundswell"), a community organization, and Friends of Seattle's Olmsted Parks ("FSOP"), a Washington nonprofit corporation, serving as fiscal agent for Groundswell.

 1. RECITALS

 1.1 The Department has joint jurisdiction with Seattle Public Utilities ("SPU") of the Lincoln Reservoir site and Bobby Morris Playfield. The Lincoln Reservoir Park Site Master Plan was developed as part of SPU's reservoir replacement project in cooperation with the Department and the community.

 1.2 Groundswell is a community organization which has helped to steward the park site since 1994 and is undertaking its third Neighborhood Matching Grant project to improve the park.

 1.3 FSOP, a Washington non-profit organization dedicated to the preservation, restoration and enhancement of the Olmsted landscape legacy, serves as fiscal agent for Groundswell.

 1.4 As a result of efforts by Groundswell, the State legislature appropriated $250,000 for park site improvements to be administered by Seattle Central Community College ("SCCC"). SCCC has in turn made these funds available as a community match for the Neighborhood Matching Grant project. In addition, Groundswell and FSOP have committed to raise additional cash and volunteer time contributions as part of the matching grant.

 1.5 Groundswell's Neighborhood Matching Grant project, B000038, approved by Ordinance 119813, will be used to replace the existing Shelterhouse with a safe and attractive set of facilities, which include a restroom building, an activity building and a maintenance building.

 1.6 The Department has used the existing Shelterhouse for the summer youth program and intends to continue that use in the new Shelterhouse. In addition, the Department, Groundswell and FSOP desire that the new Shelterhouse activity building be used for recreation and community programs with the goal of drawing more people to the park.

 1.7 All parties acknowledge the substantial public benefits from this joint effort, including the significant financial contributions secured by Groundswell and FSOP to replace the Shelterhouse.

 1.8 The Department, Groundswell and FSOP enter into this MOA for the purpose of memorializing their agreement on the terms and conditions under which the Shelterhouse project shall be financed, constructed, and operated, as well as to specify the terms and conditions under which Groundswell and FSOP propose to use the activity building.

 1.9 This Memorandum of Agreement will be reviewed and may be amended by the Department every five years.

 ACCORDINGLY, the Department, Groundswell and FSOP agree as follows:

 2. PROGRAMMING OBJECTIVES

 2.1 Long-Term Objectives. The overall objective of both parties is that the Department provides variety, balance and equity of use by the community in its management of the new Shelterhouse. The long-term objective of both parties is active year-round use of the Shelterhouse activity building with a variety of programs serving a wide range of community groups and residents. Another objective is to provide space for regularly scheduled public community meetings for affordable fees.

 2.2 Community Outreach. The Department shall reach out to local citizens and community groups, with emphasis on diverse ethnic, racial, cultural and economic populations and historically underserved communities, to maximize opportunities for all citizens to be involved in the use of the Shelterhouse activity building and its program services.

 2.3 Services. The Department shall ensure that the programs offered at the Shelterhouse are affordable and accessible to the public consistent with Department policies. The Department shall identify programs that give children, seniors, neighborhood park users, etc., opportunities to fully participate.

 3. USE OF ACTIVITY BUILDING

 3.1 Use Agreement. To reflect Groundswell and FSOP's significant contribution towards the costs of replacing the Shelterhouse, the parties intend that the standard rental fees shall be waived for up to four (4) special community events per year. The events must be scheduled in accordance with the Department's rental policy. Although staff fees cannot be waived, the Department will work with Groundswell to minimize the time that staff is required for community events or programs.

 3.2 Public Use. The Department will work to maximize opportunities for the public to use the meeting space, particularly during evenings and weekends. The Department will arbitrate the scheduling of the activity building should a conflict arise.

 4. SHELTERHOUSE DESIGN AND CONSTRUCTION

 4.1 Neighborhood Matching Grant Agreement. The Department agrees to carry out its responsibilities as defined in the Agreement between the Department of Neighborhoods, Groundswell and FSOP related to Neighborhood Matching Grant project B000038, and signed in concurrence by the Superintendent of Parks and Recreation.

 4.2 Managing Phases of Design and Construction. The Department shall manage the design and construction of the project consistent with the provisions of the Neighborhood Matching Grant Agreement. Groundswell and FSOP shall participate actively with the Department in the design development and public outreach for the project.

 4.3 Projected Construction Costs. Total costs to replace the Shelterhouse are currently estimated to be $550,000, which is subject to change as design work is completed. Groundswell and FSOP are providing a total of $500,000 in cash to the Department to be used toward the construction with $250,000 coming from Seattle Central Community College and $250,000 from the Neighborhood Matching Grant via an Interdepartmental work order. In addition to the project management and design costs, the Department has budgeted $50,000, provided in City of Seattle Ordinance 120024, for the construction phase of the project.

 5. NO ASSUMPTION OF LIABILITIES

 5.1 By executing this MOA, the Department, Groundswell and FSOP do not assume any obligations or liabilities of the other.
