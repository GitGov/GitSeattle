 - PRELIMINARY REPORT

 EVALUATION OF PMA #101 - MADRONA-SALLY GOLDMARK LIBRARY

 Resolution 29799 directs the Executive to make its recommendations on the reuse or disposal of excess property on a case by case basis, using the Procedures for Evaluation of the Reuse and Disposal of the City's Real Property adopted by that resolution. Additionally, the Resolution identifies guidelines, which are to be considered in making a recommendation. This report addresses each of the guidelines outlined in Resolution 29799 in support of the recommendation.

 Property Management Area: PMA #101 - Madrona-Sally Goldmark Library 1134 33rd Avenue

 BACKGROUND INFORMATION

 Legal Description: Lots 1 through 4, Block 13, Randell's Second Addition to the City of Seattle, according to the plat thereof, recorded in Volume 4, Page 89 of Plats, in King County, Washington.

 Physical Description and Related Factors: The site is square in shape being 100 feet across and 100 feet deep. The lot area is 10,000 square feet. It is relatively level, on-grade with 33rd Avenue and approximately 3 to 4 feet above-grade on East Union Street. File records indicate that the improvements consist of a single story brick building, originally built in 1919 as a fire station. The building has been used as a library since 1972. The main floor consists of approximately 2,750 square feet. There is a partial basement. The building was upgraded in 1986; however, problems remain with the layout, program and work areas, and electrical and ventilation systems.

 GUIDELINE A: CONSISTENCY

 The analysis should consider the purpose for which the property was originally acquired, funding sources used to acquire the property, terms and conditions of original acquisition, the title or deed conveying the property, or any other contract or instrument by which the City is bound or to which the property is subject, and City, state or federal ordinances, statues and regulations.

 The property was acquired by Warranty Deed, dated April 30, 1903, from Anna M. and D. Keeler. Ordinance 22592 accepted the deed. The Fire Department used the property until 1971 when the Fire Department "returned the building to the custody of the Building Department". In 1972, the Library Department rented the property for one year with the option to renew annually at each anniversary for four successive years from the Building Department. No succeeding agreement was negotiated.

 Guideline B: Compatibility and Suitability

 The recommendation should reflect an assessment of the potential for use of the property in support of adopted Neighborhood Plans, as or in support of low-income housing, in support of economic development, in support of affordable housing, for park or open space; in support of Sound Transit Link Light Rail station area development; as or in support of child care facilities, and in support of other priorities reflected in adopted City policies.

 Context. Transferring the jurisdiction for this property, for so long as the property is used for library purposes, is consistent with continuing to provide the immediate neighborhood with library service. Recommendations to improve the existing building include the following: new seating, expanded book collection, upgraded technology services and equipment, better electrical, communication and computer connections, more efficient circulation desk and work areas, air conditioning, modern mechanical system and expanded services at 48 hours per week. The cost of improvements is estimated at $255,000.

 Range of Options. Other options contemplating a reuse of this property as anything but a neighborhood library were not investigated due to the planned ongoing use of the facility as a library.

 Guideline C: Other Factors

 The recommendation should consider the highest and best use of the property, compatibility of the proposed use with the physical characteristics of the property and with surrounding uses,

 timing and term of the proposed use, appropriateness of the consideration to be received, unique attributes that make the property hard to replace, potential for consolidation with adjacent public property to accomplish future goals and objectives, conditions in the real estate market, and known environmental factors that make affect the value of the property.

 Highest and Best Use: The property has not been appraised since 1971 when the Fire Department was turning over the building to the Building Department. From a market perspective, the highest and best use of the site would be development consistent with current zoning, NC-1 with a 30 foot height limit.

 Compatibility with surrounding uses: The most likely use of the property is for continued use as a neighborhood library. Madrona Elementary School is west of the library. Pacific Oaks College Northwest is north of the site. Lowrise apartments and single- family residences make up the balance of the neighborhood.

 Potential for Consolidation with adjacent public property: There is no adjacent public property available for consolidation.

 Timing and Term of Proposed Use: The "Libraries for All" Plan indicates that improvements to the existing building are scheduled to be completed in 2005. It is anticipated that use as a library will continue well into the future.

 Appropriateness of the consideration: No funding is involved in this transfer of jurisdiction from Fleets and Facilities Department to the Seattle Public Library. The current fair market value for the site has not been determined as this is a transfer of jurisdiction between two General Fund departments. At such time as the property is not used for library purposes, the City Council may determine to redirect the property to serve another public purpose.

 Known environmental factors: There are no known environmental problems and no clean-up or other remedial treatment indicated for the Madrona-Sally Goldmark Library.

 Guideline D Sale

 The recommendation should evaluate the potential for selling the property to non-City public entities and to members of the general public.

 Given that the Seattle Public Library has continued to place a high priority on continued use of the property and has incorporated renovation of the building in its "Libraries for All" Plan, it would not be in the best interest of the City to recommend selling the property for any other use.

 RECOMMENDATION

 The Fleets and Facilities Department and the Seattle Public Library jointly recommend that the jurisdiction for this property be transferred from the Fleets and Facilities Department to the Seattle Public Library for so long as the property is used as a neighborhood library.
