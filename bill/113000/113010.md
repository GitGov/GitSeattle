 AN ORDINANCE relating to the Georgetown Neighborhood Plan; amending the Seattle Comprehensive Plan to incorporate portions of the Georgetown Neighborhood Plan.

 WHEREAS, on July 25, 1994, by Ordinance 117221, the City Council adopted the Seattle Comprehensive Plan, which includes a neighborhood planning element; and

 WHEREAS, City Council Resolution 28966, adopted August 1, 1994, established a Neighborhood Planning Program for the City of Seattle; and

 WHEREAS, the Neighborhood Planning program provided that distressed areas, as well as designated Urban Centers, Urban Villages and Manufacturing/Industrial Centers were eligible for funding and support through this program; and

 WHEREAS, the Georgetown Community was found to meet the Neighborhood Planning Office's program criteria for participation in the planning process because it was a distressed area and therefore declared eligible for funding and support through this program; and

 WHEREAS, the Georgetown Organizing Committee, and later the Georgetown Planning Committee, convened biweekly and monthly meetings open to everyone and regularly attended by thirteen to twenty citizens throughout the next four years; and

 WHEREAS, the Georgetown Organizing Committee conducted an extensive Phase I outreach process featuring community events, community surveys, focus groups, presentations, newsletters and other mailings, all of which led to a generally recognized vision for the community as "a strong, valuable manufacturing and industrial center that also includes the presence of an affordable, 'in-city' residential community"; and

 WHEREAS, this outreach process also created a list of priority planning topics and led to the selection of members for a planning committee to lead Phase II planning; and

 WHEREAS, subcommittees were formed and consultants were hired to study and prepare analyses and recommendations on the issues of transportation, economic development, land use, community amenities, public safety, and the environment; and

 WHEREAS, a final plan incorporating Key Strategies and Additional Activities for Near Term Implementation was reviewed and approved by the Georgetown Planning Committee and validated by the community in response to a community-wide mailer and validation event; and

 WHEREAS, the City's environmental review requirement under SEPA has been fulfilled through issuance of an addendum to the Comprehensive Plan's 1994 Final Environmental Impact Statement on November 18, 1999; and

 WHEREAS, the overall vision of the Georgetown Neighborhood Plan is consistent with the goals and policies of Seattle's Comprehensive Plan; and

 WHEREAS, the Council finds that the proposed amendments are consistent with the Growth Management Act, and will protect and promote the health, safety and welfare of the general public;
