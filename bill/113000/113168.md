 AN ORDINANCE, relating to land use and zoning; amending Sections 23.76.004, 23.76.006, 23.80.004, 23.84.010, and 23.84.038 of the Seattle Municipal Code to provide for a process to permit light rail transit facilities necessary to support the operation of the Link light rail system.

 WHEREAS, in 1996, pursuant to state law, the Central Puget Sound Regional Transit Authority (known as "Sound Transit") proposed, and Central Puget Sound voters approved, financing for a ten year regional transit system plan known as Sound Move; and

 WHEREAS, Sound Move includes the Link electric light rail line connecting the cities of SeaTac, Tukwila and Seattle, which will provide numerous benefits to Seattle's residents, workers, and visitors, and which will help the City meet its Comprehensive Plan goals for dense, mixed use urban centers and urban villages connected by high-quality public transit; and

 WHEREAS, on November 18, 1999, the Sound Transit Board of Directors, of which two City of Seattle elected officials are members, approved the light rail alignment, station locations, and maintenance base location in the city; and

 WHEREAS, the City Council and Mayor have committed to work cooperatively with Sound Transit to ensure that the light rail system gets built cost effectively, and that it is sensitive to the needs and interests of the citizens of Seattle; and

 WHEREAS, Sound Transit will apply to the City of Seattle for permits for components of the light rail system, both within and outside of public rights of way, for permanent uses and facilities; and

 WHEREAS, currently, the City's Land Use Code (SMC Title 23) does not include an applicable category of use or facility that encompasses the uses and facilities needed to operate and maintain the light rail system; and

 WHEREAS, the City Council wants to add such a category of use or facility to the Land Use Code to accommodate Sound Transit's Link light rail system;

 NOW THEREFORE, BE IT ORDAINED BY THE CITY OF SEATTLE AS FOLLOWS:

 Section 3. Section 23.80.004 of the Seattle Municipal Code, as added by Ordinance 117430, is amended to add a new subsection C as follows:

 23.80.004 Review criteria.

 A. In reviewing an application for a proposed essential public facility, the decisionmaker shall consider the following:

 1. Interjurisdictional Analysis. A review to determine the extent to which an interjurisdictional approach may be appropriate, including consideration of possible alternative sites for the facility in other jurisdictions and an analysis of the extent to which the proposed facility is of a county-wide, regional or state-wide nature, and whether uniformity among jurisdictions should be considered.

 2. Financial Analysis. A review to determine if the financial impact upon the City of Seattle can be reduced or avoided by intergovernmental agreement.

 3. Special Purpose Districts. When the public facility is being proposed by a special purpose district, the City should consider the facility in the context of the district's overall plan and the extent to which the plan and facility are consistent with the~~is~~ Comprehensive Plan.

 4. Measures to Facilitate Siting. The factors that make a particular facility difficult to site should be considered when a facility is proposed, and measures should be taken to facilitate siting of the facility in light of those factors (such as the availability of land, access to transportation, compatibility with neighboring uses, and the impact on the physical environment).

 B. If the decisionmaker determines that attaching conditions to the permit approval will facilitate project siting in light of the considerations identified above, the decisionmaker may establish conditions for the project for that purpose.

C.Light rail transit facilities.

1.Light rail transit facilities necessary to support the operation and maintenance of a light rail transit system are permitted in all zones within the City of Seattle.

2. The Director may approve a light rail transit facility pursuant to Chapter 23.76, Master Use Permits and Council Land Use Decisions only if the alignment, transit station locations, and maintenance base location of the light rail transit system have been approved by the City Council by ordinance or resolution.  3.

When approving light rail transit facilities, the Director may impose reasonable conditions in order to lessen identified impacts on surrounding properties. A Master Use Permit is not required for the installation of tracks, below-grade facilities, minor alteration of light rail transit facilities involving no material expansion or change of use, and other minor new construction that, in the determination of the Director, is not likely to have significant adverse impacts on surrounding properties.  4.

When approving light rail transit facilities, the Director may impose conditions to ensure consistency with the Seattle Design Guidelines for Link Light Rail to be developed by the City and Sound Transit.  5.

A master use permit for light rail transit facilities shall not be issued until the Director has received satisfactory evidence that the applicant has obtained sufficient funding (which might include a Full Funding Grant Agreement with a federal agency) to complete the work described in the master use permit application.
