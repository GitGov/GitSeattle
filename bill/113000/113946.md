The index used shall be the Consumer Price Index for Urban Wage Earners and Clerical Workers (CPI-W), All Items, Revised Series (1982-84=100), for June 2002, as published by the Bureau of Labor Statistics under the following formula:

 June 2002 _ June 2001

 Seattle-Tacoma-Bremerton CPI-W Seattle-Tacoma-Bremerton CPI-W X 100

 June 2001, Seattle-Tacoma-Bremerton CPI-W

 This resulting percentage increase shall be rounded to the nearest tenth of a percent.

 Section 4. Effective December 31, 2003, the base wage rates for all nonrepresented City officers and employees, except those holding Library positions and those positions identified by the titles listed in Section 1, shall be increased by one hundred percent (100%) of the percentage increase in the Seattle-Tacoma- Bremerton Area Consumer Price Index June 2003 over the same period in 2002. This increase shall not be less than two percent (2%) nor shall it exceed seven percent (7%). The index used shall be the Consumer Price Index for Urban Wage Earners and Clerical Workers (CPI-W), All Items, Revised Series (1982-84=100), for June 2003, as published by the Bureau of Labor Statistics under the following formula:

 June 2003 _ June 2002

 Seattle-Tacoma-Bremerton CPI-W Seattle-Tacoma-Bremerton CPI-W X 100

 June 2002, Seattle-Tacoma-Bremerton CPI-W

 This resulting percentage increase shall be rounded to the nearest tenth of a percent.

 Section 5. It is the express intent of the City Council that, in the event a subsequent ordinance refers to or amends the titles eligible for the wage increase specified herein, but the later ordinance fails to account for the changes made by this ordinance, the two sets of amendments should be given effect together if at all possible.

 Section 6. The heads of employing units in the City are hereby authorized to use unexpended and unencumbered funds accumulating in the budgets of their respective units to pay the compensation authorized herein. The Finance Director is authorized to draw and to pay the warrants drawn for the compensation authorized herein.

 Section 7. Any act consistent with the authority and prior to the effective date of this ordinance is hereby ratified and confirmed.
