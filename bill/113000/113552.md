 WHEREAS, the granting of cable television franchises is the method provided by State and Federal law for assuring that citizens are provided cable television services that meet community needs and interests; and

 WHEREAS, the Telecommunications Act of 1996 established a national policy to promote competition in telecommunications and cable television services and encourage the deployment of advanced technology; and

 WHEREAS, the City Council required in Ordinance 120138 that a Transition Rule be approved with provisions to assure that consumers now served in any unfranchised area have appropriate transition opportunities; and

The Office of Cable Communications shall notify Permit holders of their right to seek a Franchise for the CBFD consistent with the provisions of 47 U.S.C. Section 546. Permit holders shall notify the Office of Cable Communications within ninety (90) days of this notice as to whether they will pursue a Franchise for the CBFD and if so, whether they wish to follow the procedure in 47 U.S.C. Sections 546(b) through (g), or the alternative procedure in 47 U.S.C. Section 546(h).

 B. Once a Franchise is issued for the Central Business Franchise District (CBFD) or a Citywide Franchise District (CFD), the Director of Transportation may issue temporary and revocable street use (utility) permits for the provision of Cable Television Services within the CBFD, to other than the holder of a Franchise which covers the CBFD, only if the following conditions are met:

Sections 546 and 555, on a Franchise application.

 C. Ninety (90) days after the final determination in subsection B(2) hereof, that a holder of a permit to provide cable television service under Section 21.60.700 has failed to obtained a Franchise for the CBFD pursuant to Section 1, the permit holder must terminate the provision of Cable Television Service within the CBFD consistent with 47 U.S.C.
