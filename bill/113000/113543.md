 AN ORDINANCE revising the 2001 annual budget by creating and increasing certain expenditure allowances to provide for costs and expenses not provided for in the 2001 budget and appropriating and transferring money from the unexpended and unencumbered balance of the General Subfund and the Parks and Recreation Fund associated with utility taxes generated from City Light rate surcharges, by a three-fourths vote of the City Council.

 WHEREAS, the price for electricity has reached unprecedented levels in the wholesale power markets due largely to deregulation and weather conditions; and

 WHEREAS, the chaotic wholesale power markets have created a severe strain on the financial performance and cash flow of Seattle City Light; and

 WHEREAS, the City Council has passed Council Bill 113530 to provide for the implementation of a Power Cost Adjustment effective March 1, 2001 in order to secure the long-term financial strength of Seattle City Light; and

 WHEREAS, the implementation of the March 1, 2001 Power Cost Adjustment is estimated to result in an additional $4,000,000 in utility tax revenue to the City's General Fund and the Park and Recreation Fund; and

 WHEREAS, the City supports elderly, disabled and low-income rate assistance programs and this period of escalating utility costs places greater importance on enrolling eligible utility customers into these programs; and

 WHEREAS, the City can avoid paying the high prices in the wholesale power market by aggressively promoting conservation programs and implementing power-saving improvements; NOW, THEREFORE,

 BE IT ORDAINED BY THE CITY OF SEATTLE AS FOLLOWS:

 Section 1. The following amounts are appropriated and transferred from the unexpended and unencumbered balances in the General Subfund, to the following accounts in the Department of Finance General:

 Description Fund # Summit Code Amount

 A) Low-Income Utility 00100 Q (TBD) $200,000 Customer Outreach

 B) Rate Assistance 00100 Q (TBD) $800,000

 C) Municipal Conservation 00100 Q (TBD) $1,000,000 Investments

 D) Electricity Conservation and Curtailment Program 00100 Q (TBD) $2,000,000

 Final allocation of the funds appropriated to the Department of Finance General will be completed once the information requested below and associated ordinances are provided to Council:

 A) Funding provided for Low-Income Utility Customer Outreach will support efforts to increase awareness of existing assistance programs. By March 1, 2001, Seattle City Light, Seattle Public Utilities, the Human Services Department, the Office of Housing, the Department of Neighborhoods and other relevant City agencies will provide to the Energy and Environmental Policy Committee an integrated plan for promoting the existence of and increasing participation in existing low-income rate assistance, weatherization, and conservation programs offered by the City and/or other governmental entities. This plan will consider opportunities to contract with agencies outside the City or with local community organizations to further this goal. As necessary, funds from the Department of Finance General will be transferred to the Light Fund and various Funds within Seattle Public Utilities for this general purpose.

 B) Funding provided for Rate Assistance could be used for purposes including, but not necessarily limited to: (1) increasing funding for rate assistance programs such as City Light's Project Share; and (2) offsetting the revenue losses associated with exempting low-income customers from the rate increase to be implemented on March 1, 2001. After coordinating with other relevant agencies, City Light will present to the Energy and Environmental Policy Committee, by March 1 2001, specific recommendations regarding allocation of the funds provided for rate assistance. As necessary, funds from the Department of Finance General will be transferred to the Light Fund for this general purpose.

 C) Funding provided for Municipal Conservation Investments will support the implementation of conservation measures needed to help reach the target of reducing the City government's electricity consumption by 10% and to meet longer term conservation and sustainability goals. By March 1, 2001, the Office of Sustainability and Environment will provide a summary report to the Energy and Environmental Policy Committee describing the steps that have been taken to date in promoting and implementing municipal conservation, the opportunities that are still available, and the barriers that remain to further advancing the goal of increasing conservation within the City. This report will include recommendations about what how best to direct additional conservation funding for City departments and agencies.

 D) Funding for Electricity Conservation and Curtailment will be directed towards achieving both short- and long-term reductions in electricity use among City Light's overall customer base. If necessary, funds from the Department of Finance General will be transferred to the Light Fund for this purpose. City Light will provide to the Energy and Environmental Policy Committee by February 8, 2001 an assessment of how additional investments in conservation and curtailment can be targeted to help achieve the short-term goal of reducing overall electricity use by 10%. This assessment will include, but not be limited to, opportunities such as distributing compact fluorescent lights to every residential customer, enhancing existing and developing new incentive programs for the residential and commercial sectors, and increasing public awareness of how short-term behavioral changes can help reduce electricity consumption.

 In addition, working with the Office of Housing and other relevant City Agencies, City Light will, by March 1, 2001, provide a plan to support partnerships with the Seattle Housing Authority and other low-income housing providers to help enhance the implementation of energy conservation measures in the housing units under the direct administration of these housing providers. If necessary, funds from the Department of Finance General will be transferred to the Light Fund for this purpose.

 Section 2. In order to offset unanticipated charter revenues to the Parks and Recreation Fund the expenditure allowance in the designated account of the 2001 Budget of the Department of Finance General is reduced as follows:
