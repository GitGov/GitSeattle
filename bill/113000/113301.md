 The City shall judge the adequacy and the sufficiency of records and the results produced in accordance with applicable WSDOT and federal regulations. If, during the course of this Agreement, the work or the documentation provided by the Foundation is out of compliance with the applicable requirements, the Foundation shall take such corrective action as the City may require.

 A. The contractor will not discriminate against any employee or applicant for employment because of race, color, religion, sex or national origin. The contractor will take affirmative action to ensure that applicants are employed and that employees are treated during employment without regard to their race, color, religion, sex, or national origin. Such action shall include, but not be limited to, the following: employment, upgrading, demotion or transfer; recruitment or recruitment advertising: layoffs or termination; rates of pay or other forms of compensation, and selection for training, including apprenticeship. The contractor agrees to post in conspicuous places, available to employees and applicants for employment, notices to be provided by the Foundation setting forth the provisions of this nondiscrimination clause.

 B. The contractor will, in all solicitations or advertisements for employees placed by or on behalf of the contractor, state that all qualified applicants will receive consideration for employment without regard to race, color, religion, sex or national origin.

 C. The contractor will send to each labor union or representative of workers with which he has a collective bargaining agreement or other contract or understanding, a notice to be provided by the Foundation advising the said labor union or workers' representative of the contractor's commitments under this Section 11-2 and shall post copies of the notice in conspicuous places available to employees and applicants for employment.

 D. The contractor will comply with all provisions of Executive Order 11246 of September 24,1965, and of the rules, regulations, and relevant orders of the Secretary of Labor.

 E. The contractor will furnish all information and reports required by Executive Order 11246 of September 24,1965, and by the rules and regulations and orders of the Secretary of Labor, or pursuant thereto, and will permit access to those books, records, and accounts by the Federal Highway Administration and the Secretary of Labor for purposes of investigation to ascertain compliance with such rules, regulations, and orders.

 F. In the event of the contractor's noncompliance with the nondiscrimination clauses of this contract or with any of such rules, regulations or orders, this contract may be canceled, terminated, or suspended in whole or in part and the contractor may be declared ineligible for further government contracts or federally assisted construction contracts in accordance with procedures authorized in Executive Order 11246 of September 24, 1965, and such other sanctions may be imposed and remedies invoked as provided in Executive Order 11246 of September 24,1965, or by rule, regulation, or order of the Secretary of Labor, or as otherwise provided by law.

 G. The contractor will include the provisions of this Section in every subcontract or purchase order unless exempted by rules, regulations, or orders of the Secretary of Labor, so that such provisions will be binding upon each subcontractor or vendor. The contractor will take such action with respect to any subcontract or purchase order as the Foundation, the City, the Washington State Department of Transportation, or Federal Highway Administration may direct as a means of enforcing such provisions including sanctions for noncompliance: Provided, however, that in the event a contractor becomes involved in, or is threatened with, litigation with a subcontractor, he may request the United States to enter into such litigation to protect the interests of the United States.

 H. The Foundation further agrees that it will be bound by the above equal opportunity clause with respect to its own employment practices when it participates in federally assisted construction work.

 I. The Foundation also agrees:

In addition the Foundation agrees to furnish the City such other information as it may require for the supervision of such compliance and that it will otherwise assist the City in the discharge of its primary responsibility for securing compliance.

 K. Violation. If, upon investigation, the ESD Director finds probable cause to believe that the Foundation has failed to comply with any of the terms of these provisions the Foundation and the Director of Seattle Transportation shall be so notified in writing. The Director of Seattle Transportation shall give the Foundation an opportunity to be heard, after ten day's notice. If the Director of Seattle Transportation concurs in the findings of the ESD Director, the Director of Seattle Transportation may suspend the Agreement and/or withhold any funds due or to become due to the Foundation, pending compliance by the Foundation with the terms of these provisions.

 L. Material Breach. Failure to comply with any terms of these provisions shall be a material breach of this Agreement. In addition, the Foundation agrees that, if it fails or refuses to comply with these undertakings, the City may take any or all of the following actions:

 2. Refrain from extending any further assistance to the Foundation under the program with respect to which the failure or refusal occurred until satisfactory assurance of future compliance has been received from the Foundation;

 The current list of firms accepted as certified by the Office of Minority and Women's Business Enterprises (OMWBE.) A list of firms accepted as certified by OMWBE is available from that office at (360) 704-1180 or on line through their web site at (www.wsdot.wa.gov/omwbe/).

C. DBE Participation

 When a DBE participates in a contract, only the value of the work actually performed by the DBE will be counted.

 1. Count the entire amount of the portion of the contract that is performed by the DBE's own forces. Include the cost of supplies and materials obtained by the DBE for the work of the contract. Include supplies purchased or equipment leased by the DBE. Exclude supplies and equipment the DBE subcontractor purchases or leases from the Contractor or its affiliate.

 2. Count the entire amount of fees or commissions charged by a DBE firm for providing a bona fide service, such as professional, technical, consultant, or managerial services, or for providing bonds or insurance, provided the fees are reasonable.

 3. When a DBE subcontracts part of the work of its contract to another firm, the value of the subcontracted work shall be counted if the DBE's subcontractor is also a DBE. The work that a DBE subcontracts to a non-DBE firm does not count as participation.

 D. DBE Prime Contractor

 A DBE prime contractor shall only count the work performed with its own forces as well as the work performed by DBE subcontractors and DBE suppliers.

 E. Joint Venture

 When a DBE performs as a participant in a joint venture, only count that portion of the total dollar value of the contract equal to the distinct, clearly defined portion of the work that the DBE performs with its own forces.

 F. Commercially Useful Function

 You may count expenditures to a DBE contractor if the DBE is performing a commercially useful function on that contract.

 1. A DBE performs a commercially useful function when it is responsible for execution of the work of the contract and is carrying out its responsibilities by actually performing, managing, and supervising the work involved. To perform a commercially useful function, the DBE must also be responsible, with respect to materials and supplies used on the contract, for negotiating price, determining quality and quantity, ordering the material, installing (if applicable) and paying for the material itself.

 2. A DBE does not perform a commercially useful function if its role is limited to that of an extra participant in a transaction, contract, or project through which funds are passed in order to obtain the appearance of DBE participation.

 3. A DBE does not perform a commercially useful function if it fails to exercise responsibility with its own work force for at least 30 percent of the total cost of its contract.

 G. Trucking

 Use the following factors in determining whether a DBE trucking company is performing a commercially useful function:

 1. The DBE must be responsible for the management and supervision of the entire trucking operation for which it is responsible for on a particular contract, and there cannot be a contrived arrangement for the purpose of meeting the DBE goals.

 2. The DBE must itself own and operate at least one fully licensed, insured, and operational truck that is used on the contract.

 3. Credit towards project goals for DBE trucking firms who do not own at least one truck, will be granted only for the fees the DBE firm retains for providing the hauling service.

 4. In order for DBE project goals to be credited, DBE trucking firms must be covered by a subcontract or a written agreement approved by WSDOT prior to performing their portion of the work.

 5. DBE trucking firms are required to perform at least fifty percent (50%) of the work with his/her own trucks and personnel.

 6. DBE trucking firms may utilize owner/operator trucks. The number of owner/operator trucks may not exceed any limitations on subletting or reassigning the work specified. All owner/operators must appear on the DBE contractor's or DBE subcontractor's payroll designated as owner/operator. The hours worked or wages paid may be reflected either on the payroll or on the record of payments to each owner/operator.

 7. DBE trucking firms may lease or rent trucks from other sources, except from prime contractors to whom they are contractors, provided:

 a) A written valid lease/rental agreement on all trucks leased or rented is submitted to the project manager prior to the beginning of work; and

 b) Only the vehicle (not the operator) is leased or rented.

 c) The agreement must include the lessors name, trucks to be leased, and agreed upon amount or method of payment (hour, ton or load hauled).

 d) All lease agreements shall be long-term agreements, not project-by-project.

 The DBE is limited to leasing or renting two (2) additional trucks for each truck owned by the DBE trucking firm.

 H. Expenditures with DBEs

 Expenditures with DBEs for materials or supplies shall be counted as provided in the following:

 I. Manufacturer

 If the materials or supplies are obtained from a DBE manufacturer, count 100 percent of the cost of the materials or supplies.

 J. Regular Dealer

 1. Counting

 If the materials or supplies are purchased from a DBE regular dealer, count 60 percent of the cost of the materials or supplies.

 2. Definition

 a) To be a regular dealer, the firm must be an established, regular business that engages, as its principal business and under its own name, in the purchase and sale or lease of the products in question.

 b) A person may be a regular dealer in such bulk items as petroleum products, steel, cement, gravel, stone, or asphalt without owning, operating, or maintaining a place of business, as provided elsewhere in this specification, if the person both owns and operates distribution equipment for the products. Any supplementing of regular dealers' own distribution equipment shall be by a long-term lease agreement and not on an ad hoc or contract- by-contract basis.

 c) Packagers, brokers, manufacturers' representatives, or other persons who arrange or expedite transactions are not regular dealers.

 L. Purchased from a DBE

 With respect to materials or supplies purchased from a DBE who is neither a manufacturer nor a regular dealer, count the entire amount of fees or commissions charged for assistance in the procurement of the materials and supplies, or fees or transportation charges for the delivery of materials or supplies required on a job site, provided the fees are reasonable and typical for the services rendered. No part of the cost of the materials and supplies themselves shall be counted.

 M. Procedures Between Award and Execution

 After award and prior to execution of the contract, the Contractor shall provide the names and addresses of all firms that submitted a bid or quote to the contractor as part of bidding this contract and note which of those firms were successful and will participate in the contract. These firms may be contacted to solicit general information as follows:

 1. Age of the firm

 2. Average of its gross annual receipts

 This information is necessary to maintain a bidder's list in compliance with the requirements of the 49 CFR, Part 26. Simply stated: who is soliciting the work and what is their capacity? The contracting agency will use this information to accurately determine an overall goal based on the percentage of DBEs who are ready, willing and able to perform the work.

 N. Reporting

 The contractor shall submit a "Quarterly Affidavit of Amounts Paid DBE Participants" on a quarterly basis for every quarter in which the contract is active (work is accomplished) or upon completion of the project, as appropriate. The quarterly reports are due on the 20th of April, July, October, and January for the four respective quarters. The dollars reported will be in accordance with the "DBE Eligibility" section of this specification.

 O. Payment

 Payment for complying with the conditions of this specification and any associated DBE requirements is the contractor's responsibility. Those costs shall be incidental to the respective bid items.
