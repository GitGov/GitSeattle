Investment earnings attributable to the subfunds within the Fleets and Facilities Fund shall be deposited into the appropriate subfunds. Prior to January 1, 2002, all revenues and expenditures of the Fleets and Facilities Department will continue to be included in existing separate subfunds of the Executive Services Fund. The Director of Finance, under the authority of the Mayor, and after consultation with the Director of the Fleets and Facilities Department, shall reallocate assets and liabilities from the Executive Services Fund to the Fleets and Facilities Fund in order to effectuate this ordinance. Until the January 1, 2002 effective date of this section creating a new Fleets and Facilities Fund, the Director of the Department of Fleets and Facilities has authority to expend, and the responsibility for, funds allocated to the existing separate subfunds in the Executive Services Fund for Fleets and Facilities.

 Section 2. Effective January 1, 2002, the assets and liabilities of the Department of Finance, the Personnel Department, and the Office of Sustainability and Environment shall move from the Executive Services Fund to the General Fund. The Director of Finance, under the authority of the Mayor, and after consultation with the Personnel Director and the Director of the Office of Sustainability and Environment, shall reallocate assets and liabilities from the Executive Services Fund to the General Fund in order to effectuate this ordinance. Until the January 1, 2002 effective date of this section, the Director of Finance, the Personnel Director, and the Director of the Office of Sustainability and Environment have authority to expend, and the responsibility for, funds allocated to their separate subfunds for the Department of Finance, the Personnel Department, and the Office of Sustainability and Environment within the Executive Services Fund.

 Section 3. Effective January 1, 2002, the Executive Services Fund is hereby abolished.

 Section 4. Per Council policy, the Department of Finance will assess a Debt Management Policy Advisory Committee (DMPAC) fee on all revenue and general obligation debt issued by the City or guaranteed by the City. This fee, as detailed in SMC 3.76.030, will be collected at the time of issuance and will be deposited in a dedicated accounting unit. The total balance in the DMPAC accounting unit, including the balance of fee proceeds, and all unexpended appropriation authority will be carried forward each year by ordinance.

 To comply with the above policy, the Council directs the Executive to carry over any remaining 2001 expenditure authority and associated revenues in Project Q5142323 in Finance General and Project A8120002 in the Finance Subfund of the Executive Services Fund, which are the two existing DMPAC expenditure projects. The expenditure authority and revenues so carried over will be transferred into a new DMPAC Expenditure Project Account in the General Subfund of the General Fund, the designation of which will be determined by City Accounting. Future appropriation authority and revenue in the DMPAC Expenditure Project Account will be carried over each year, by ordinance, until fully expended. For budgetary purposes and financial reporting purposes, City Accounting will designate the net revenue balance in this DMPAC Expenditure Project Account as "reserved."

 Section 5. Any action taken consistent with the authority and prior to the effective date of this ordinance is hereby ratified and confirmed.
