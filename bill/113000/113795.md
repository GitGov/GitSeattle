 Notes for Default Table 10-5B(2)

 1. It is acceptable to use the U-factors in Table 10-5B(2) for all concrete and masonry walls, provided that the grouting is equal to or less than that specified.

 - For ungrouted walls, use the partially-grouted column.

 - For metal studs and z-furring, use the continuous-metal-framing category.

 - For discontinuous metal clips 1 inch square or smaller, use the metal-clip category.

 - For insulation that is attached without any framing members (e.g. glued), use the continuous-insulation-uninterrupted-by-framing category. Continuous insulation may be installed on the interior or exterior of masonry walls, or between stand-alone walls in multi-layer masonry walls, or on the interior or exterior of the concrete.

 2. For Table 10-5B(2), the U-factor includes R-0.17 for exterior air film and R-0.68 for interior air film - vertical surfaces. For insulated walls, the U-factor also includes R-0.45 for 0.5 in. gypsum board. U-factors are provided for the following configurations:

(a) Concrete wall: 8-in. normal weight concrete wall with a density of 145 lb/ft3.

(b) Solid grouted concrete block wall: 8-in. medium weight ASTM C90 concrete block with a density of 115 lb/ft3 and solid grouted cores.

(c) Partially grouted concrete block wall: 8-in. medium weight ASTM C90 concrete block with a density of 115 lb/ft3 having reinforcing steel every 32 in. vertically and every 48 in. horizontally, with cores grouted in those areas only. Other cores are filled with insulating material only if there is no other insulation.  3. For walls with insulation contained in a framing layer, the U- factors in Table 10-5B(2) assume contact (and thermal bridging) between the mass wall and other framing. For wall assemblies with multiple layers where the wood or metal framing layer does not contact the concrete or masonry layer (i.e. walls with an airspace between the stud wall layer and the mass wall layer), it is acceptable to use the appropriate wood or metal frame wall default U-factors in Tables 10-5 or 10-5A. Note, it is acceptable to use this approach where the insulation extends beyond the framing and is in contact with the mass wall layer (e.g. a nominal four-inch metal stud containing insulation that is nominally six inches thick and therefore extends two inches beyond the back of the metal stud).

 4. Except for wall assemblies qualifying for note 3, if not taken from Table 10-5B(2), mass wall U-factors shall be determined in accordance with ASHRAE/IESNA Standard 90.1-1999, Appendix A, Section A3.1 and Tables A-5 to A-8, or Section A9.4. If not taken from Table 10-9, heat capacity for mass walls shall be taken from ASHRAE/IESNA Standard 90.1-1999, Appendix A, Table A-6 or A-7.

 Section 3. Table 10-6 of the Energy Code is amended as follows:

2. The Code Official may approve alternative designs not in full compliance with this Code when existing building or occupancy constraints make compliance impractical or where full compliance would place an unreasonable economic burden on the project.  1132.2.2 Economizer Capability for Water Source Heat Pump Systems: Where water-source heat pumps are being replaced, the individual heat pump being replaced shall have valves complying with Section 1432.2.2 and

 a. the individual heat pump being replaced shall be equipped with economizer coil and operating controls. When the total capacity of all the heat pumps with economizer coil connected to a particular system exceeds 50% of the installed capacity of that system, then the condenser water system and cooling tower for the entire system shall be capable of providing economizer that complies with Section 1433. (This may necessitate changing the cooling tower and loop piping size.), or

 b. the system shall comply with a long-term plan that has been approved by DCLU and that will bring the mechanical system serving that floor into compliance with the economizer requirements in Section 1433 through incremental changes. For projects using this option, the plan shall be updated whenever the Energy Code is revised.

EXCEPTIONS:

1. Systems that comply with the air economizer requirements.

2. The Code Official may approve alternative designs not in full compliance with this Code when existing building or occupancy constraints make compliance impractical or where full compliance would place an unreasonable economic burden on the project.

 Section 5. Section 1132.3 of the Energy Code is amended as follows:

 1132.3 Lighting and Motors:  Where the use in a space changes from one use in Table 15-1 to another use in Table 15-1, the installed lighting wattage shall comply with Section 1521 or 1531.

(Where this threshold is triggered, the areas of the affected spaces may be aggregated for code compliance calculations.)

 Where less than 60% of the fixtures in a space enclosed by walls or ceiling-height partitions are new, the installed lighting wattage shall be maintained or reduced. Where 60% or more of the lighting fixtures in a suspended ceiling are new, and the existing insulation is on the suspended ceiling, the roof/ceiling assembly shall be insulated according to the provisions of Chapter 13, Section 1311.2.

 Where new wiring is being installed to serve added fixtures and/or fixtures are being relocated to a new circuit, controls shall comply with Sections 1513.1 through 1513.5. Where a new lighting panel (or a moved lighting panel) with all new raceway and conductor wiring from the panel to the fixtures is being installed, controls shall comply with Section 1513.6.

 Those motors which are altered or replaced shall comply with Section 1511.

 Section 6. Section 1133 of the Energy Code is amended as follows:

 1133 Change of Occupancy or Use: Changes of occupancy or use shall comply with the following requirements:

 a. Any unconditioned space that is altered to become semi- heated, cooled, or fully heated, or any semi-heated space that is altered to become cooled or fully heated space shall be required to be brought into full compliance with this Code. For spaces constructed prior to this Code, the installed heating output capacity shall not exceed 16 Btu/h per square foot unless the building envelope complies with Chapter 13. Existing warehouses and repair shops are considered unconditioned space unless they are indicated as conditioned space in DCLU records or they were built after 1980 and they comply with the building envelope requirements for conditioned space in effect at the time of construction. (See the Seattle Mechanical Code for requirements for combustion appliances.)

 b. Any Group R occupancy which is converted to other than a Group R occupancy shall be required to comply with all of the provisions of Sections 1130 through 1132 of this Code.

 Section 7. Section 1301 of the Energy Code is amended as follows:

 1301 Scope: Conditioned buildings or portions thereof shall be constructed to provide the required thermal performance of the various components according to the requirements of this chapter. Unless otherwise approved by the building official, all spaces shall be assumed to be at least semi-heated.

 EXCEPTIONS:

 1. Greenhouses isolated from any conditioned space and not intended for occupancy.

 2. As approved by the building official, spaces not assumed to be at least semi-heated.

 3. Unconditioned Group ~~M~~U occupancy accessory to Group R occupancy.

 Section 8. Section 1310.2 of the Energy Code is amended as follows:

 1310.2 Semi-Heated Spaces: All spaces shall be considered conditioned spaces, and shall comply with the requirements in Section 1310.1 unless they meet the following criteria for semi- heated spaces. The installed heating equipment output, in Climate Zone 1, shall be 3 Btu/(h ( ft2) or greater but not greater than 8 Btu/(h ( ft2) and in Climate Zone 2, shall be 5 Btu/(h ( ft2) or greater but not greater than 12 Btu/(h ( ft2). Heating shall be controlled by a thermostat mounted not lower than the heating unit and capable of preventing heating above 44 degrees space temperature. ~~For semi-heated spaces, the only prescriptive, component performance or systems analysis building envelope requirement shall be that:~~Climate Zone 1

~~a. U-0.10 maximum for the roof assembly or~~

~~b. continuous R-9 insulation installed entirely outside of the roof structure, or~~

 Section 9. Section 1312.2 of the Energy Code is amended as follows:

 1312.2 Solar Heat Gain Coefficient and Shading Coefficient: Solar Heat Gain Coefficient (SHGC), shall be determined, certified and labeled in accordance with the National Fenestration Rating Council (NFRC) Standard by a certified, independent agency, licensed by the NFRC.

 EXCEPTION: Shading coefficients (SC) or solar heat gain coefficient for the center of glass shall be an acceptable alternate for compliance with solar heat gain coefficient requirements. Shading coefficients or solar heat gain coefficient for the center of glass for glazing shall be taken from Chapter ~~29~~30 of Standard RS-27 or from the manufacturer's ~~test~~data using a spectral data file determined in accordance with NFRC 300.

Note that using the exception for the SHGC for the center-of- glass does not give the full credit for the overall product (including the frame) that the NFRC-certified SHGC does. Though the SHGC for the frame is not zero (the ASHRAE Handbook of Fundamentals indicates that the SHGC can range from 0.11-0.14 for metal frames and from 0.02-0.07 for wood/vinyl/fiberglass frames), the SHGC for the frame is invariable lower than that for the glass. Consequently, an NFRC-certified SHGC will generally be lower.

 Section 10. Section 1322 of the Energy Code is amended as follows:

 1322 Opaque Envelope: Roof/ceilings, opaque exterior walls, opaque doors, floors over unconditioned space, below grade walls, slab on grade floors and radiant floors enclosing conditioned spaces shall be insulated according to Section 1311 and Tables 13-1or 13-2. Compliance with nominal R-values shall be demonstrated for the thermal resistance of the added insulation in framing cavities and/or insulated sheathing only. Nominal R-values shall not include the thermal transmittance of other building materials or air films.

 For metal frame assemblies used in spaces with electric resistance space heat, compliance shall be demonstrated with the component U-factor for the overall assembly based on the assemblies in Chapter 10.

Area-weighted averaging of the R-value is not allowed. When showing compliance with R-values, the minimum insulation R- value for all areas of the component shall comply with Table 13-1. When calculating compliance using U-factors, area-weighted averaging is allowed. Where insulation is tapered (e.g. roofs), separate assembly U-factors shall be calculated for each four-foot section of tapered insulation.

 EXCEPTIONS:

 1. Opaque smoke vents are not required to meet insulation requirements.

 2. For prescriptive compliance only,

a. for glazing areas that are 30% and less of the gross wall area, the insulation of the perimeter edge of an above grade floor slab which penetrates the exterior wall may be reduced to R-5 provided that the glazing U-factor is reduced by U-0.05 below that required in Tables 13-1 and 13-2.

b. for glazing areas that exceed 30% of the gross wall area, the perimeter edge of an above grade floor slab which penetrates the exterior wall may be left uninsulated provided that the glazing U-factor is reduced by U-0.10 below that required in Tables 13-1 and 13-2.((~~The perimeter edge of an above grade floor slab which penetrates the exterior wall may be left uninsulated provided that the wall insulation is increased by R-2 above that required in Tables 13-1 and 13-2.~~

3. For roofs with continuous rigid insulation on the top of the roof, the insulation R-value may be averaged for compliance with minimum prescriptive R-values only, provided that both:

a. the minimum insulation is no less than R-5 (but not including area within 6 inches of each roof drain), and

b. the area-weighted average insulation is R-46 (in lieu of R-30) for electric resistance space heat and R-27 (in lieu of R-21) for other fuels.

 a. (i) is double-glazed with a minimum 1/2 inch airspace and with a low-e coating having a maximum emittance of e-0.40 in any type of frame or

(ii) has an area-weighted U-factor of 0.60 or less.

U-factor calculations shall use overall assembly U-factors. When this exception is used there are no SHGC requirements) and

b. has a visible transmittance of (i) 0.60 or greater for the center of the glazing assembly in any type of frame or (ii) has an area-weighted visible transmittance for the overall assembly including the frame of 0.52 or greater for fixed glazing and 0.44 or greater for operable glazing. Visible transmittance shall be determined in accordance with Section 1312.2, and,

~~b.))~~c. does not exceed 75% of the gross exterior wall area of the display side of the street level story. However, if the display side of the street level story exceeds 20 feet in height, then this exemption may only be used for the first 20 feet of that story.

 When this exception is utilized, separate calculations shall be performed for these sections of the building envelope and these values shall not be averaged with any others for compliance purposes. The 75% area may be exceeded on the street level, if the additional glass area is provided from allowances from other areas of the building.

 2. Single glazing for ornamental, security, or architectural purposes shall be included in the percentage of total glazing area, U-factor calculation and SHGC as allowed in the Tables 13-1 or 13- 2.

 Section 24. Section 1413.2 of the Energy Code is amended as follows:

 1413.2 Control: Air and water economizers shall be controlled by a control system capable of determining if outside air can meet part or all of the building's cooling loads.

 Section 25. Section 1413.3 of the Energy Code is amended as follows:

Controls shall not preclude the economizer operation when mechanical cooling is required simultaneously.

 EXCEPTIONS:

1. ~~Economizers on individual, direct expansion, cooling systems with capacities not greater than 75,000 Btu/h may include controls that limit simultaneous operation of the economizer and mechanical cooling for the purpose of preventing ice formation on cooling coils.~~Individual direct expansion units that have a rated cooling capacity less than 65,000 Btu/h and use nonintegrated economizer controls that preclude simultaneous operation of the economizer and mechanical cooling.

2. Water cooled chillers with waterside economizer.

 Section 26. The Energy Code is amended by adding a new Section 1413.4 to read as follows:

 1413.4 Economizer Heating System Impact: Any HVAC system that increases the building heating energy use during economizer operation is not allowed (e.g. single-fan/dual-duct systems and multizone systems).

 EXCEPTIONS:

 1. Where the heating is allowed by Section 1435.

 2. Water source heat pump systems that comply with Section 1433, Exception 3.

 Note that single-fan/dual-duct systems and multizone systems do not comply with this requirement. This is because economizer operation lowers the temperature of the air entering the hot deck heating coil, increasing its energy use. In order to use this type of system, a water economizer must be used, or the system must meet one of the economizer exceptions and have neither type of economizer. (Another resolution is to use a dual-fan/dual-duct system where the hot deck fan supplies only return air or return air plus minimum ventilation air.)

 This requirement will not affect three-deck multizone since they cannot work with an air economizer in any case (it would make the neutral deck a cold deck).

 An exception to the heating impact is provided for economizers on VAV systems that cause zone level heating to increase due to a reduction in supply air temperature. Reducing supply air temperatures on a cooling-VAV system will reduce fan energy (particularly if the system has a variable speed drive), offsetting the energy lost due to increased reheat energy.

 See the discussion and diagrams of Section 6.3.1.4 of ASHRAE/IESNA Standard 90.1-1999 in the Users Manual.
