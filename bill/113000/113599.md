 WHEREAS, green spaces are a major component of the City's comprehensive open space system.

 WHEREAS, a property known as "Hitt's Hill," generally located in the Columbia City area of Seattle, has been identified by the community as possessing characteristics that favor its inclusion in the City's green spaces inventory; and

 WHEREAS, the 2001 Adopted Budget earmarked $700,000 in Finance General for potential acquisition of the "Hitt's Hill" property, the actual expenditure of which would only be made after the City determined by preliminary study that acquisition is feasible, and adopted an ordinance that fully and legally describes the property as well as the terms of acquisition; and

 WHEREAS, the Open Space and Trails Bond Fund has sufficient resources to provide interim funding of $285,000 for the Hitt's Hill property purchase; and

 WHEREAS, a number of possible sources have been identified to secure the acquisition and purchase of the Hitt's Hill property; and

 WHEREAS, the Department of Parks and Recreation is conducting such studies to determine that the acquisition of the property is feasible; and

 WHEREAS, Metropolitan King County's 2001 Adopted Budget allocates $200,000 of Conservation Futures Tax funds for The City of Seattle's acquisition of the "Hitt's Hill" property; NOW, THEREFORE,
