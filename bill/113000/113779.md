 AGREEMENT FOR SALE OF REAL ESTATE

 THIS AGREEMENT is entered into as of the last date of execution hereof by PAUL V. DE AUSTRIA and HAZEL I. TUGADI (collectively "Seller"), husband and wife, and THE CITY OF SEATTLE ("Purchaser"), a first class city of the State of Washington.

 RECITALS:

 Purchaser desires to purchase from Seller and Seller desires to sell to Purchaser a parcel of real property consisting of approximately eight thousand four hundred thirty (8,430) square feet of land, located in the City of Seattle, King County, Washington, as described on the attached Exhibit A, together with all improvements, rights, easements and appurtenances located thereon and appertaining thereto (the "Property"), in consideration of the Purchase Price, as hereinafter defined, and the other terms, covenants and agreements contained in this Agreement.

 NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of and in reliance on the parties' mutual promises and undertakings and the mutual benefits to be derived from this Agreement, the parties agree as follows:

 1. Sale of Property. Subject to the terms of this Agreement, Purchaser shall purchase from Seller and Seller shall sell and convey to Purchaser the Property, subject to: (a) all taxes, assessments, restrictions, easements, agreements and other matters affecting the Property; (b) all applicable zoning rules, restrictions, regulations, resolutions and ordinances and building restrictions and governmental regulations now or hereafter in effect; and (c) the right of the public in any street or highway forming a boundary of the Property.

 2. Purchase Price. The total purchase price for the Property ("Purchase Price") shall be TWO HUNDRED SEVENTY FIVE THOUSAND AND NO/100 DOLLARS ($275,000.00), all in cash at Closing, as hereinafter defined. Within fifteen (15) days after the execution of this Agreement by both parties (hereinafter referred to as "the date hereof"), Purchaser shall deliver to the local office of Transnation Title Insurance Company, or such other escrow agent as may be satisfactory to both Purchaser and Seller ("Escrow Agent"), an earnest money deposit ("the Deposit") in an amount equal to Five Percent (5%) of the Purchase Price stated herein, which equals the sum of Thirteen Thousand Seven Hundred Fifty Dollars ($13,750.00). The Deposit shall be paid in cash or cashier's check or remitted in the form of a wire transfer according to instructions given to Purchaser by the Escrow Agent, and shall be applied to the Purchase Price on the date of Closing (hereinafter defined). The balance of  the Purchase Price shall be paid by Purchaser to Seller on the date of Closing as provided in Paragraph 8. In addition, the Seller shall be reimbursed for eligible relocation expenses as stated in Exhibit B-1 and Exhibit B-2.

 3. Title; Investigation, Study and Survey; Repair & Indemnification Obligation.

 (a) "Marketable Title" to be Provided by Seller: Seller shall furnish Purchaser with marketable title to the Property. "Marketable title" means title insurable by Transnation Title Insurance Company (the "Title Company") at its standard rates, without exception except as approved or deemed approved by Purchaser in accordance with this paragraph. Upon the execution of this Agreement, Purchaser shall order (at its sole cost and expense in the event this Agreement is terminated, but otherwise at Seller's cost and expense except for the additional premium for extended coverage, which additional premium shall be at Purchaser's expense), a current title commitment for the issuance of an extended coverage 1987 ALTA form of Owner's Policy of Title Insurance covering the property that Purchaser is purchasing under this Agreement (the "Title Commitment") together with a list of encumbrances enumerated thereon. Every item in the Title Commitment to which Purchaser does not object in writing within fifteen (15) days from Purchaser's receipt of the Title Commitment shall be deemed to be a "Permitted Exception." As to every item on the Title Commitment to which Purchaser objects, Seller shall have ten (10) days after receipt of Purchaser's notice of objections (the "Cure Period") within which (i) to remove or render otherwise acceptable to Purchaser each item to which Purchaser has objected, or (ii) to commit to Purchaser in writing signed by Seller and delivered to Purchaser, that without additional consideration, Seller shall do so within 15 days of the Execution of this Agreement or (iii) give notice to Purchaser that Seller declines to correct such objection to title; provided, that all monetary liens and encumbrances shall be paid in full or removed on or before the Closing Date, whether or not objected to by Purchaser. If Seller does not correct such objections within forty-five (45) days after full execution of this Agreement, Purchaser shall either (i) waive such uncured objections and accept title to the Property subject to such uncured objections (each of which shall be deemed a Permitted Exception) without an adjustment to the Purchase Price or (ii) terminate this Agreement by written notice to Seller and Escrow Agent, in which event this Agreement shall terminate, the Deposit and all interest earned thereon shall be refunded to Purchaser, and neither party shall have any further rights, duties or obligations under this Agreement. If Purchaser does not make such election within forty-five (45) days after full execution of this Agreement, Purchaser shall be conclusively deemed to have elected to accept the Property subject to such objections and to have approved title as marketable. If Purchaser approves or is deemed to have approved the title shown in the Title Commitment, Seller's obligation to furnish to Purchaser marketable title to the Property shall be satisfied.

 (b) License Granted for Entry onto Property for Inspection, Study and Survey Purposes: Seller grants to Purchaser and its officers, employees, designated consultants and contractors a license to enter the Property for the purpose of completing an inspection, study and survey of the Property at Purchaser's expense to determine the physical condition of the Property and if the Property contains any Hazardous Materials. Purchaser is to give Seller five (5) days' notice of Purchaser's intent to enter the Property for said purposes. The license granted in this Subparagraph 3(b) shall expire on the date of Closing or the date this Agreement is terminated, whichever is earlier. The survey shall be made by a licensed surveyor or Registered Professional Engineer in accordance with ALTA/ACSM class standards in detail that is sufficient to permit the Title Company to delete the standard printed exception from the Owner's policy of title/insurance pertaining to discrepancies in area or boundary lines, encroachments, overlapping improvements or similar matters, and to show the total square footage and the boundaries of the Property together with the location of any and all easements and rights-of-way, the location of any and all utilities, and topographic elevations at the Property corners. Within ten (10) days after Purchaser's receipt of any such inspection, study or survey, Purchaser shall deliver to Seller and the Escrow Agent a copy of any report regarding the same and, if received by Purchaser, revised Exhibits A and B that correspond to and accurately describe the area to be purchased and identified herein as the Property.

 (c) Purchaser's Property Repair Obligation: If Purchaser does not purchase the Property, Purchaser covenants and agrees to repair any damage to the Property occasioned by the entry upon the Property or the conduct of any inspection, study or survey pursuant to Subparagraph 3(b) by or for Purchaser. Such repair shall be to the condition in which the Property existed immediately prior to initial entry upon the Property by or for Purchaser pursuant to the license granted herein. This repair obligation shall survive the date of Closing and the termination of this Agreement.

 4. Representations and Warranties of Purchaser. Purchaser represents and warrants to and agrees with Seller as follows:

 (a) Purchaser is a municipal corporation duly organized, validly existing and in good standing under the laws of the State of Washington and has the power to own its property and assets.

 (b) As of the Date of Closing, this Agreement has been duly authorized, executed and delivered by Purchaser; constitutes the legal, valid and binding obligation of Purchaser; and is enforceable against Purchaser in accordance with its terms.

 (ii) a fully executed Certificate of Non-Foreign Status; (iii) a counterpart executed real estate excise tax affidavit; and (iv) such other instruments as are reasonably necessary to consummate this purchase and sale transaction.

 (f) Escrow Agent's Obligations. At Closing, following receipt of sufficient funds from Purchaser, the Escrow Agent shall pay to Seller the Purchase Price, as adjusted and prorated as provided in this Agreement. At or as soon as possible after Closing, the Escrow Agent shall have the Title Company issue to Purchaser an owner's extended coverage ALTA (1987) title insurance policy in the amount of the Purchase Price and insuring fee simple title to the Property subject only to exceptions approved or deemed to have been approved by Purchaser and not limited by any limitations of Purchaser's remedies against Seller contained in this Agreement.

Any documentary transfer tax, real estate excise tax, or other similar tax shall be paid by Seller. Purchaser shall pay the cost of recording the statutory warranty deed. Seller shall pay the premium for the issuance of a basic Title Commitment and the title policy to be issued to Purchaser at Closing, provided, however, that Purchaser shall pay the cost of extended (ALTA) coverage as well as any additional endorsement premiums. All other recording and closing costs (including the escrow fee but excluding attorneys' and brokers' fees, costs and expenses associated therewith) shall be shared equally by the parties. Each party shall pay the brokers' fees and attorneys' fees, costs, and expenses incurred by such party with respect to the negotiation of this Agreement, and the consummation of the transaction contemplated herein.

 9. Deed; Possession. Upon the Closing of the sale provided for in this Agreement, the Seller shall convey marketable title to the Property to Purchaser by statutory warranty deed, subject to the Permitted Exceptions, which deed shall be delivered to Purchaser through the Escrow Agent. Purchaser shall be entitled to possession of the Property on the calendar day immediately following the date of Closing.

 10. Default. In the event of default by Seller, Purchaser shall be entitled to immediate refund of the Deposit and all interest earned thereon, or Purchaser may bring suit for damages but its recovery shall be limited to recovery of the amount of the Deposit and all interest earned thereon, as liquidated damages, which remedies shall be Purchaser's sole and mutually exclusive remedies. In the event of default by Purchaser, in addition to any other remedy Seller may have at law or equity, Seller may direct the Escrow Agent to immediately deliver to Seller the Deposit and all interest earned thereon, as liquidated damages. Either party shall also have the right to specifically enforce this agreement (but without the right to claim damages in such a proceeding.)

 Purchaser and Seller hereby acknowledge that the extent of damages to Seller or Purchaser occasioned by a breach of this Agreement by the other would be impossible or extremely impracticable to ascertain and that the Deposit represents fair and reasonable compensation under the circumstances existing at the date of this Agreement for Seller having been prevented from selling the Property to a third party or of Purchaser being prevented from purchasing the Property from Seller.

 11. Condition of Property. The Property shall be delivered to Purchaser at Closing in substantially the same physical condition as of the date hereof, excepting ordinary wear and tear. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement or any investigation of the Property, Purchaser acknowledges and agrees that, if it purchases the Property, the Property is being purchased in its "as is" and "where is" condition as of the Closing Date and that neither Seller, nor any of its employees or agents, has made any express warranty or representation regarding the condition of the Property or its suitability for the intended use and none shall be implied by law. Except with respect to any liability resulting from a misrepresentation of Seller hereunder, Purchaser releases Seller from any liability to Purchaser arising out of or relating to the condition of the property, including but not limited to the physical condition of the property; zoning; environmental matters or contamination; effects of local, state and federal regulations on use and enjoyment of the property; soil suitability and compaction; drainage; and fitness or usability of improvements for any purpose. Purchaser represents and acknowledges that this provision was explicitly negotiated and bargained for as a material part of Seller's consideration being paid byPurchaser.

 12. Risk of Loss.

 Risk of loss or damage to the Property by fire or other casualty, from the date of this Agreement through the date of Closing shall be on the Seller, and thereafter shall be on the Purchaser.

 13. Brokers; Indemnification Against Brokers' Claims. Purchaser and Seller represent and warrant to and agree with each other that no person or entity is entitled to be paid a fee or commission in connection with the transfer of the Property by Seller to Purchaser. If any individual or entity shall assert a claim to a finder's fee or commission as a broker or a finder for the transfer of the Property, then the party who is alleged to have retained such individual or entity shall defend, indemnify and hold harmless the other party from and against any such claim and all costs, expenses, liabilities and damages incurred in connection with such claim or any action or proceeding brought thereon. This indemnification obligation shall survive the Closing and the termination of this Agreement.

 14. Indemnification Obligations.

 (a) Purchaser shall indemnify and hold Seller harmless from any costs, loss or damage incurred as a result of the entry upon the Property and conduct pursuant to Subparagraph 3(b) of any inspection, study or survey by or for Purchaser prior to the date of Closing or the date this Agreement is terminated, whichever is earlier, except any costs, loss or damage resulting from Seller's negligence.

 (b) Purchaser shall indemnify and hold Seller harmless from any costs, expenses or liability resulting from any proceedings to secure zoning changes, variances, permits or orders required for the intended use by Purchaser.

 (c) Seller shall indemnify and hold Purchaser harmless from any and all costs, losses, damages, suits, causes of actions, and liabilities whatsoever and howsoever incurred as a result of or in connection with the entry upon the Property for any reason whatsoever by or for Seller or by any of Seller's employees, contractors, or agents after the date of Closing.

 Legal Description of the Property

 Situated in the City of Seattle, County of King, State of Washington.

 EXHIBIT B-1

 RELOCATION AGREEMENT

 THIS RELOCATION AGREEMENT ("Agreement") is entered into between THE CITY OF SEATTLE (hereinafter "SEATTLE"), a Washington municipal corporation, and PAUL V. DE AUSTRIA and HAZEL I. TUGADI (hereinafter collectively "OWNERS"), husband and wife.

 A. Background

 SEATTLE intends to acquire OWNERS' real property located at 12538 - 27th Avenue NE, Seattle, WA (the "Existing Site"). Pursuant to and consistent with applicable state and federal law and Seattle Resolution 23390, SEATTLE intends to provide to OWNERS certain relocation assistance for the moving and re-establishment of OWNERS' residence as specified in this Agreement.

 SEATTLE and OWNERS have entered into a mutually accepted Real Estate Purchase & Sale Agreement dated _______________ (the "Purchase Agreement").

 General information about the property to be acquired by SEATTLE, the OWNERS, and the OWNERS' move, is set forth in Attachment 1, which is appended hereto and incorporated herein by this reference.

 OWNERS intend to relocate their residence to (the Replacement Site").

 B. Mutual Commitments.

 OWNERS hereby commit to SEATTLE that OWNERS shall move themselves and their personal property from OWNERS' Existing Site (as defined in Attachment 1) as provided in the Purchase Agreement and the Lease that is executed as part of Closing, except in the case of an event of force majeure. In accordance with the Uniform Relocation Act, Ch. 8.26 of the Revised Code of Washington, and Seattle Resolution 23390 and in consideration of OWNERS' moving themselves and their personal property from their Existing Site, SEATTLE shall pay moving and replacement housing expenses for OWNERS in accordance with such legislation and this Agreement. For the purposes of this Agreement, force majeure shall only mean fire, flood, and a similar act of nature, unavoidable casualty, war or insurrection, labor dispute not caused by OWNERS, or another cause solely beyond OWNERS' control that cannot be reasonably anticipated; provided that in no event shall changes in market conditions be deemed force majeure.

 C. Moving Expenses.

 1. General.

 OWNERS elect to accept a fixed payment for reasonable and necessary, actual moving and related expenses incurred by OWNERS for the relocation of personal property as described generally in Attachments 2, 3 and 5, which are appended hereto and incorporated herein by this reference. The determination of the amount of such payment is based upon a room count allowance provided by OWNERS identifying a total of 10 rooms in dwelling, attic area, out building, and exterior and agreed to by SEATTLE.

 2. Documentation and Limitation.

 OWNERS acknowledge that unless OWNERS actually move their personal items in accordance with this Agreement, SEATTLE shall have no obligation to make any payment to OWNER pursuant to law or this Agreement or otherwise for residential and non-business relocation purposes.

 (a) By electing to perform a self-move or use a commercial mover and/or rigger ("Mover"), OWNERS assume responsibility for the physical relocation of all personal property on the Existing Site. Either OWNER or OWNERS' designee shall act as the general contractor for the disassembly, packing, cartage, unpacking, re- assembly, placement, and any and all other related work and shall conduct the move pursuant to a workable plan for the relocation.

 (b) Either OWNER or the Mover shall be responsible for set-up and coordination of all work performed by subcontractors, implementation of the move, and final setup at the new facility, including any necessary openings in the wall or roof of either OWNERS' existing building or the Replacement Site if required.

 (c) Either OWNERS or the Mover shall provide adequate insurance to cover any expense in the event of casualty, loss or damage to personal or real property, the cost of which is agreed to be a reimbursable moving expense. OWNERS shall inquire whether full replacement insurance is available through a rider on any existing insurance OWNERS may have in place, and to obtain such insurance in the most cost-effective manner. In no event shall SEATTLE or any of its officers, employees, consultants or agents be responsible for any loss, casualty, damage, injury to person including death, or any other claim, liability or cause of action arising from the move. OWNERS shall indemnify, defend and hold harmless SEATTLE and its officers, agents, consultants and employees from any such loss, casualty damage, personal injury or death, claim, liability, or cause of action.

 (d) Each equipment reinstallation shall be completed so that the equipment is installed to a condition that is functionally equivalent to its present condition. Any betterments shall be OWNERS' responsibility

 (e) OWNERS may not request additional reimbursement because SEATTLE and OWNERS have agreed that OWNERS' total relocation for moving and the purchase price differential shall be capped as provided in this Agreement.

 D. Replacement Housing Payment.

 1. General.

 OWNERS elect to receive a replacement housing payment as described generally in Attachments 2, 3 and 5. Payment determination is based upon the selection of a comparable dwelling located at 19701 - 40th Place NE, Seattle, WA, and approved by SEATTLE.

 2. Documentation and Limitation.

 Replacement housing expenses are supported by the selection of a comparable dwelling that SEATTLE agrees is "reasonable, and necessary." OWNERS shall purchase a replacement site within twelve months (12) from the closing date specified in or pursuant to the Purchase Agreement. OWNERS shall complete a Decent Safe and Sanitary inspection of the replacement dwelling and understand that the statements, findings, decisions, and conclusions appearing in the report of such inspection are made solely for the purpose of determining the eligibility for replacement housing payments, and are not intended to be, nor do they constitute, warrantees or guarantees by SEATTLE or any of its employees or agents that said replacement dwelling is free from defects or meets local, state, or federal housing codes. SEATTLE hereby recommends that OWNERS obtain a structural inspection prior to purchasing a replacement dwelling.

 E. Final Payment and Release.

 Upon receipt of the requests marked for final payment, or deemed by SEATTLE to be a request for final payment, SEATTLE shall notify OWNERS that the final payment has been made and shall provide OWNERS with a written list of all payments made by SEATTLE and of those claims for payment SEATTLE finds to be outside the scope of this Agreement. If OWNERS do not respond in writing within fifteen (15) days of SEATTLE'S final payment notice with specific written objections as to particular expenses not paid by SEATTLE, OWNERS shall be deemed to have agreed that the final payments represent complete and final payment of all relocation and replacement housing benefits for pursuant to the Uniform Relocation Act, Ch. 8.26 RCW and Seattle Resolution 233390 and shall thereby release SEATTLE from any future claims or liability for payment of moving, relocation, or replacement housing expenses as described in the Uniform Relocation Act, Ch. 8.26 or Seattle Resolution 23390. OWNERS' written objections under this paragraph shall be considered under the appeals process.

 G. Payment

 SEATTLE shall make a direct relocation payment to OWNERS on the closing date specified in or pursuant to the Purchase Agreement for the Existing Site. Payment is based upon a fixed payment of a dislocation allowance for actual moving and related expenses and replacement housing expenses that aggregate $3,900.00. OWNERS shall sign and return to SEATTLE the following ATTACHMENTS, which are appended hereto and incorporated herein by reference, prior to SEATTLE's making any such payment, in part or in full, to OWNER:

 (i) Attachment 3: Relocation Claim Form

 (ii) Attachment 4: Relocation Certification Form

 (iii) Attachment 5: Payment Request Form

 . Specific Performance.

 This Agreement shall be subject to specific performance by either party in the event of default by the other party, in addition to any other remedy that may be available at law.

 I. Merger.

 This Agreement represents the complete and final understanding of the parties related to the subject matters referenced herein and sets forth all of the promises, agreements, conditions, representations and agreements between OWNER and SEATTLE.

 J. Applicable Law and Venue.

 This Agreement shall be governed and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of Washington. Venue for any action shall be in the Superior Court of Washington for King County.

 K. Cooperation.

 SEATTLE and OWNERS commit to cooperate in good faith to implement the terms of this Agreement recognizing that moving plans and improvements to the Replacement Site may need to be adjusted or accelerated and normal business operations altered to meet OWNERS' commitment to vacate and quit its Existing Site no later than 30 days from and after the closing date specified in or pursuant to the Purchase Agreement.

 L. SEATTLE Approvals.

 SEATTLE acknowledges that in order for OWNERS to meet SEATTLE's schedule, OWNERS require prompt turnaround in communications. SEATTLE therefore agrees that SEATTLE shall respond as rapidly as possible to any request from OWNERS. SEATTLE's approval of requests by OWNERS as required or permitted hereunder shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed.

 RELOCATION AGREEMENT

 THIS RELOCATION AGREEMENT ("Agreement") is entered into between THE CITY OF SEATTLE (hereinafter "SEATTLE"), a Washington municipal corporation, and NORTHWEST WATERPROOFING CO., INC. (hereinafter "OWNER"), a Washington corporation.

 A. Background

 SEATTLE intends to acquire OWNER's real property located at 12538 27th Avenue NE, Seattle, Washington. Pursuant to and consistent with applicable state and federal law and Seattle Resolution 23390, SEATTLE intends to provide to OWNER certain relocation assistance for the moving and re-establishment of OWNER's business as specified in this Agreement.

 SEATTLE and OWNER have entered into a mutually accepted Real Estate Purchase & Sale Agreement dated _______________ (the "Purchase Agreement").

 General information about the property to be acquired by SEATTLE, the OWNER, and the OWNER's move, is set forth in Attachment 4, which is appended hereto and incorporated herein by this reference.

 OWNER intends to relocate its business to _______________, WA (the Replacement Site")

 B. Mutual Commitments.

 OWNER hereby commits to SEATTLE that OWNER shall move its personal property from OWNER's Existing Site (as defined in Attachment 1, which is appended hereto and incorporated herein by this reference) as provided in the Purchase Agreement and the Lease that is to be executed as part of Closing, except in the case of an event of force majeure. In accordance with the Uniform Relocation Act, Ch. 8.26 of the Revised Code of Washington and Seattle Resolution 23390 and in consideration of OWNER's commitment to move from its Existing Site, SEATTLE shall make a fixed payment to OWNER in lieu of reimbursement for OWNER's moving and re-establishment expenses in accordance with such legislation and this Agreement. For the purposes of this Agreement, a force majeure event shall only mean fire, flood, and a similar act of nature, unavoidable casualty, war or insurrection, labor dispute not caused by OWNER, or another cause solely beyond OWNER's control that cannot be reasonably anticipated; provided that in no event shall a change in market conditions be deemed a force majeure event.

 C. Moving Expenses.

 OWNER elects to accept a fixed payment in lieu of reimbursement for reasonable actual moving and related expenses incurred by OWNER, as specified in Attachment 5, which is appended hereto and incorporated herein by this reference.

 D. Re-Establishment Expenses.

 OWNER elects to accept a fixed payment in lieu of reimbursement for reasonable, actual, re-establishment expenses

 E. Documentation and Limitations.

 (1) Unless OWNER actually moves its personal property and operations in accordance with this Agreement, SEATTLE shall have no obligation to make any payment to OWNER pursuant to law or this Agreement or otherwise for business relocation and re-establishment purposes.

 (2) By electing to perform a self-move or use a commercial mover and/or rigger ("Mover"), OWNER assumes responsibility for the physical relocation of all personal property on the Existing Site. Either OWNER or OWNER's designee shall act as the general contractor for the disassembly, packing, cartage, unpacking, re- assembly, placement, and any and all other related work and shall conduct the move pursuant to a workable plan for the relocation.

 (3) Either OWNER or the Mover shall be responsible for set-up and coordination of all work performed by subcontractors, implementation of the move, and final setup at the new facility, including any necessary openings in the wall or roof of either OWNER's existing building or the Replacement Site, if required.

 (4) Either OWNER or the Mover shall provide adequate insurance to cover any expense in the event of casualty, loss or damage to personal or real property, the cost of which is agreed to be a reimbursable moving expense. OWNER shall inquire whether full replacement insurance is available through a rider on any existing insurance OWNER may have in place, and to obtain such insurance in the most cost-effective manner. In no event shall SEATTLE be responsible for any loss, casualty damage, injury to any person, including death, or any other claim, liability, or cause of action arising from the move. OWNER agrees to and shall indemnify, defend and hold harmless SEATTLE, its officers, agents, consultants and employees from any such loss, casualty damage, personal injury or death, claim, liability, or cause of action.

 (5) Each equipment reinstallation shall be completed so that the equipment is installed to a condition that is functionally equivalent to its present condition. Any betterments shall be OWNER'S responsibility.

 (6) OWNER may not request additional reimbursement or payment for OWNER's business relocation and re-establishment beyond that specified in this Agreement. In no event shall the fixed payment to be made by Seattle hereunder exceed $20,000.00 in the aggregate, regardless of the amount of expenses actually incurred or expended by OWNER in connection with the relocation and re-establishment of its business.

 (7) The determination of the amount of the payment to be made by SEATTLE under this Agreement is based upon documentation provided by OWNER showing the average annual net earnings during the last two (2) tax years and agreed to by SEATTLE.

 F. Final Payment and Release.

 Upon receipt of the requests marked for final payment, or deemed by SEATTLE to be a request for final payment, SEATTLE shall notify OWNER that the final payment has been made and shall provide OWNER with a written list of all payments made by SEATTLE and of those claims for payment SEATTLE finds to be outside the scope of this Agreement. If OWNER does not respond in writing within fifteen (15) days after SEATTLE's final payment notice with specific written objections as to particular expenses not paid by SEATTLE, OWNER shall be deemed to have agreed that the final payment represents complete and final payment of all relocation and re- establishment benefits for the move of its business pursuant to the Uniform Relocation Act, Ch. 8.26 RCW and Seattle Resolution 23390, and shall thereby release SEATTLE from any future claims or liability for payment of moving, relocation, or re-establishment expenses as described in the Uniform Relocation Act, Ch. 8.26 RCW and Seattle Resolution 23390. OWNER'S written objections under this paragraph shall be considered under the appeals process.

 G. Payment

 SEATTLE shall make a direct, fixed payment to OWNER in lieu of reimbursement for actual moving and related expenses and actual reasonable re-establishment expenses, which payment shall total $20,000.00. OWNER shall sign and return to SEATTLE Attachments 3, 4 and 5, which are appended hereto and incorporated herein by reference, prior to SEATTLE's making any such payment, in part or in full, to OWNER:

 (i) Attachment 3: Relocation Claim Form

 (ii) Attachment 4: Relocation Certification Form

 (iii) Attachment 5: Payment Request Form

 In order to avoid or reduce hardship to OWNER, SEATTLE shall make a partial payment of $10,000 on the closing date of the Purchase Agreement for the subject property if Attachments 3, 4, and 5 have been signed by OWNER and returned to SEATTLE. The remaining $10,000 relocation benefit shall be paid after the complete removal of ALL personal property and OWNER's operations from the Existing Site. SEATTLE shall not unreasonably withhold any relocation payment.

 H. Specific Performance.

 This Agreement shall be subject to specific performance by either party in the event of default by the other party, in addition to any other remedy that may be available at law.

 I. Merger.

 This Agreement represents the complete and final understanding of the parties related to the subject matters referenced herein and sets forth all of the promises, agreements, conditions, representations and agreements between OWNER and SEATTLE.

 J. Applicable Law and Venue.

 This Agreement shall be governed and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of Washington. Venue for any action shall be in the Superior Court of Washington for King County.

 K. Cooperation.

 SEATTLE and OWNER commit to cooperate in good faith to implement the terms of this Agreement recognizing that moving plans and improvements to the Replacement Site may need to be adjusted or accelerated and normal business operations altered to meet OWNER'S commitment to vacate and quit its Existing Site no later than 30 days from and after the closing date specified in or pursuant to the Purchase Agreement.

 L. SEATTLE Approvals.

 SEATTLE acknowledges that in order for OWNER to meet SEATTLE's schedule, OWNER requires prompt turnaround in communications. SEATTLE shall respond as rapidly as possible to any request from OWNER.

 Re: Acquisition of 12538 27th Avenue, Seattle, Washington

 Dear Mr. De Austria and Ms. Tugadi:

 Please be advised that The City of Seattle, a first class city of the State of Washington (the "City"), has, under RCW 8.12.030, the authority to condemn real property.

 It is our understanding, at this time, that in order to avoid condemnation proceedings, you will cooperate in a negotiated sale of the property at 12538 27th Avenue NE, in Seattle, and for that cooperation we express our appreciation. If these negotiations are unsuccessful, it is the intent of the undersigned to present legislation to the City Council to acquire your property at 12538 - 27th Avenue in Seattle, WA, through exercise of the City's power of eminent domain.

 Very truly yours,

 THE CITY OF SEATTLE
