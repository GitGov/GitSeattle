 ORDINANCE __________________

 AN ORDINANCE relating to the Department of Parks and Recreation authorizing the exchange of portions of Lots 23 and 24, Block 3, Sander's First Addition to West Seattle, adjacent to and within a portion of park land located in the West Duwamish Greenbelt to accomplish a Lot Boundary Adjustment for the purposes of correcting an encroachment onto and extinguishing an easement for vehicle access over a portion of the West Duwamish Greenbelt; finding such exchange of property meets the requirements of Ordinance 118477; and authorizing acceptance of reimbursement of associated costs thereto.

 WHEREAS, a Lot Boundary Adjustment is sought which will eliminate an encroachment onto and an easement for vehicle access over property held for open space purposes; and

 WHEREAS, in accordance with the directives of Ordinance 118477, no land held for park open space purposes shall be sold, transferred or changed to a non-park use unless it shall be replaced with equivalent or better property or facilities in the same vicinity and serving the same community; and

 WHEREAS, equivalent property has been identified that is acceptable as replacement property for the park land to be transferred to accomplish the Lot Boundary Adjustment; and

 WHEREAS, the parcels proposed for exchange have been appraised and determined to be of equal value; and

 WHEREAS, the Lot Boundary Adjustment will reflect an exchange of similar and close to equal areas of land resulting in no reduction in size of the property to be held for open space purposes; and

 WHEREAS, the Lot Boundary Adjustment and conveyance documents related thereto will make the vehicle access easement granted by the City of Seattle in instrument recorded under King County Recording Number 8102100638 over, through and across park land in the West Duwamish Greenbelt part of the property exchanged by the City, merging fee title and extinguishing the easement; and
