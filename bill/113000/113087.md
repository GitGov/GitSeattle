All grants or interagency agreements exceeding $500,000 for the life of the grant or interagency agreement, or which are not provided for in the annual budget, or which represent a significant departure from or new direction from projects and programs approved in SPU's budget, shall require a separate acceptance ordinance and budget amendment before such grants or interagency agreements can be accepted.

 Section 3. Normal budget ordinance amendments shall continue to be required when the expenditure of any grant or interagency agreement funds when added to funds already budgeted will exceed the total funds budgeted for the relevant budget category.

In order that the Council retain the opportunity to review any specific grant proposals, grant offers, and interagency agreements even though such proposals, grants or interagency agreements would not fall within the requirements of Section 2 above, the Director of Seattle Public Utilities shall regularly notify the Chair of the appropriate City Council Committee of all grant applications and interagency agreements which were not budgeted and not approved by Council resolution when the application is made or at the time that the opportunity for a new interagency agreement becomes known to the Department.
