~~3. The agency must be registered with the Finance Director pursuant to Sections 5.40.080 and 5.40.085 at least thirty (30) days prior to the event.~~ C. The exemption in subsection A shall apply to activities conducted by a person other than a nonprofit human services agency only if:

 1. A nonprofit human services agency contracts with that person to conduct the activities on its behalf; and

~~4~~2. The nonprofit human services agency ~~must be~~remains fiscally responsible for the ~~event~~activities and receives the full benefit and use of the proceeds from ~~the event.
