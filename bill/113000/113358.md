Attachments:

 Attachment 1: Early Implementation Fund Recommendation for First Hill Improvement Association Early Implementation Fund

 Evaluation using Criteria established in Resolution 29783

 Applicant: First Hill Improvement Association

 Criterion 1: The project must be a high priority element of a proposed neighborhood plan that has been through the community validation process or a neighborhood plan for which the Council has taken final action on the approval and adoption package. The project must be discrete and have a defined product or outcome that is likely to be completed within two years. Funds may be used as seed money for conceptual or detailed engineering design, or for a phase of a project.

First Hill Improvement Association Stewardship Organization Project  - This project is a high priority and II-B-2 in the plan matrix. The project proposes to formalize the First Hill Improvement Association as a broad-based stewardship organization for the neighborhood plan. This project's goals include the development of a business plan, the development of a central management organization for various neighborhood capital projects, the creation of a neighborhood promotional brochure and the initiation of newsletter publication by the stewardship organization. DON's budget authority will be increased by $10,000 and the funds will be disbursed to the First Hill Improvement Association for project implementation as pursuant to the scope of work and contract negotiated with DON and as consistent with this ordinance.

Yesler Terrace Ballfield Improvements - This project is a high priority and II-B-6 in the plan matrix. The project will make improvements to the ballfield at Yesler Terrace. The project is expected to be completed by June 2000. DPR's budget authority will be increased by $20,000 to manage and implement the project.

Union/Terry Pathway Improvements - This project is an extension of activities in II-B-11 and I-C-3 in the matrix. The project will make improvements to the pedestrian passage through the greenbelt at Union Street and Terry Avenue between Hubbel Avenue and Pike Street. Additional design work will also be performed to determine whether the grade of the path can be reduced to make the path easier to use. The project is expected to be completed by ~~June 2000~~ December 31, 2000. City Light's budget authority will be increased by ~~$20,000~~ $17,000 and the Department of Neighborhoods' budget authority will be increased by $3,000 to manage and implement the project.

 Criterion 2: The project must be consistent with the Comprehensive Plan. The project must also be consistent with other adopted City plans, such as the Seattle Comprehensive Transportation Program and the Parks COMPLAN. If the project is subject to City regulatory standards, the project must meet or appear capable of meeting those standards.

 These projects are consistent with the Comprehensive Plan.

 Criterion 3: The project requires no or minimal increases in City staff or City contribution for ongoing operation and maintenance. The project must not duplicate an existing or planned project already included in a departmental CIP or operating budget.

 DPR has agreed to manage and implement the Yesler Terrace Ballfield improvements. City Light and the Department of Neighborhoods have~~s~~ agreed to manage and implement the Union/Terry Pathway Improvements.

 Criterion 4: If the project is to be implemented by an entity other than the City, the entity must demonstrate that it has the capacity to implement the project in a timely manner, and propose measures the City can use to hold the entity accountable.

 The First Hill Improvement Association has the capacity to implement the First Hill Improvement Association Stewardship Organization Project in a timely manner.

 Any further conditions for this applicant:

 None.
