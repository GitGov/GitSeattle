 ATTACHMENT A

 CITY OF SEATTLE

 EDA - PLANNING ASSISTANCE GRANT

 Program Description

 I. Purpose

 The City of Seattle - Office of Economic Development (OED) will contract with Seattle Business Assistance Center, a community based non-profit organization, to provide technical assistance for small businesses and individuals at every stage from start-up to existing businesses. The goals of the assistance are to develop, grow and sustain small businesses located within Seattle with a special emphasis on providing services within Seattle's low-income communities and to create employment opportunities for low- and moderate-income persons.

 II. Objectives

 The project includes the activities described below:

 Business technical assistance services such as business planning, financial planning, marketing, contract procurement and loan application assistance will be provided to approximately 300 businesses over an eleven month period. Loan application assistance will include Small Business Administration (SBA) Loans, include SBA's 7(a) Guaranty Loan Program.

 The City will match the EDA funds with money for additional technical assistance if needed or for business lending as the preferred approach to implement City and community strategies for providing technical assistance and lending activities to start-up and existing businesses in the City's lower-income neighborhoods. The purpose is to originate, package and service small business loans for existing and startup businesses in the City of Seattle that could not obtain conventional financing on their own and in a manner that predominantly benefits disadvantaged communities.

 Businesses who receive assistance will include those who receive loans from the same non-profit, businesses referred by other financial and technical assistance service providers, other small businesses and individuals starting businesses in Seattle.

 III. Use of EDA Funds

 The EDA funds are being sought and will be used to contract with a community based organization to provide business technical assistance services.

 IV. Eligible Areas

 The technical assistance services will help to develop, grow and sustain small businesses located in Seattle, with a focus on Seattle's low-income communities. These services are also intended to address economic conditions in a Target Area roughly equivalent to the City's preferred area in its Enterprise Community (EC) application, which represents the Southeast Seattle and Central Area neighborhoods.
