 AN ORDINANCE relating to the City Light Department; amending Seattle Municipal Code Chapter 21.49 to increase rates for the use of electricity.

 WHEREAS, Ordinance 120149, passed by the City Council on November 6, 2000, increased rates for the sale of electricity by the Department for the period beginning January 1, 2001 to offset increased purchased power expenses resulting from high prices in wholesale power markets; and

 WHEREAS, Ordinance 120247, passed by the City Council on January 29, 2001, provided for a further increase in rates beginning March 1, 2001 to offset the effect of poor water conditions and the resulting need to purchase additional energy in the wholesale market at continuing high prices; and

 WHEREAS, streamflows in the Skagit and Pend Oreille rivers have continued to decline in the current water year and are now expected to be at the lowest levels ever recorded; and

 WHEREAS, as a result of deteriorating water conditions the Department will be required to buy additional power in the wholesale market at high prices; and

 WHEREAS, financial results in 2001 will be far below acceptable levels unless action is taken to increase revenues; and

 WHEREAS, in April 2001 the Department issued $182,210,000 in Revenue Anticipation Notes to provide the cash required to meet the Department's financial obligations during the current period of high purchased power costs; and

 WHEREAS, the Department needs to establish rates sufficient to ensure that the principal amount of the Revenue Anticipation Notes will be paid at the March 28, 2003 maturity date; and

 WHEREAS, in order to provide additional incentive for residential customers with high levels of consumption to adopt conservation measures and otherwise curtail their consumption, it is desirable to establish a third rate block for residential customers, with the rate for consumption in that block set closer to the marginal cost of power and applied to high consumption levels; and

 WHEREAS, as a result of the fact that they were exempted from the March 1, 2001 Power Cost Adjustment, low-income customers constitute the only rate class for which rates are differentiated by season, and

 WHEREAS, it is desirable to eliminate the seasonal rate differential for low-income customers; and

 WHEREAS, the Department recommends that a portion of excess power costs in 2001 be deferred on an accounting basis and recognized as expenses in 2002 and 2003; and

 WHEREAS, the Department has proposed that rates be increased by adding a power cost adjustment equivalent to $0.0049/kWh effective July 1, 2001; and

 WHEREAS, revenue from the proposed power cost adjustment effective July 1, 2001, together with revenue from the power cost adjustments which took effect on January 1, 2001 and March 1, 2001 and/or revenue from wholesale market sales, will be used to offset excess power costs incurred in 2001, including those costs deferred on an accounting basis and recognized as expenses in 2002 and 2003; and

 WHEREAS, the City Council has expressed its commitment to taking whatever future rate actions are necessary to preserve the financial integrity of the Department; NOW THEREFORE,

 BE IT ORDAINED BY THE CITY OF SEATTLE AS FOLLOWS:

 Section 1. Section 21.49.030 A of the Seattle Municipal Code (as amended by Ordinance 120247) is amended to read as follows:

 Schedule VRC (Variable Rate General Service)

 Schedule VRC is an optional rate schedule for high demand general service provided to customers eligible to be served under Schedule HDC.

 At the time a customer elects to take service under Schedule VRC, the customer must choose whether to pay an energy charge as defined in Option 1 - DJ-COB or Option 2 - DJ Mid-Columbia. After choosing an energy charge option, a customer may not choose a different energy charge option for a period of one (1) year except that, should a new rate ordinance which changes Schedule VRC be adopted during this time, the customer may request a change in energy charge option upon the effective date of the new ordinance or may request return to a standard rate schedule upon the effective date of the new ordinance.

 Section 7. Section 21.49.081 of the Seattle Municipal Code (as created by Section 6 of Ordinance 120247) is amended to read as follows:

 Automatic BPA Cost Adjustment

 City Light will calculate the difference (in dollars) between what City Light would have paid for its BPA purchases for a twelve month period beginning October 1, 2001 under the rates contained in the BPA Final Proposal of May 2000 and what City Light will actually pay for the same period under the BPA rates in effect October 1, 2001. The dollar difference will then be multiplied by 1.1095, which is the effective tax rate, and the product divided by forecast load (in kWh) over the twelve month period beginning October 1, 2001 to calculate a number (in dollars/kWh rounded to the nearest ten- thousandth of a dollar) which will be called the "BPA increment".

 For example, if the increase in BPA contract costs equaled $18,422,543 per year (a 17% increase), this cost increase would be multiplied by the 1.1095 effective tax rate to get required additional customer revenue of $20,439,811. This additional revenue required would then be divided by the forecast 9,136,407,000 kWh load to calculate a BPA increment of $.0022/kWh{.

 Energy charges in effect on October 1, 2001 under all rate schedules except Schedules T, F, and VRC and energy charges scheduled to take effect on March 1, 2002 under all rate schedules except T, F, and VRC will be increased by the BPA increment, provided that for customers served under Schedules REC, RLC, RES, and RLS, energy charges shall be increased by one-half of the BPA increment. The BPA increment will increase equally first block and second block charges in residential rates and peak and off-peak rates for large and high demand general service customers as well as the single energy charges for small and medium general service customers.

 If at any time after October 1, 2001 BPA announces an adjustment in the rates to be charged for sales of power to City Light, then City Light shall recompute the BPA increment for the purpose of ensuring that only the increase in costs under City Light's contract with BPA will be passed through to City Light's customers. City Light's rates shall be adjusted to give effect to the recomputed BPA increment, and the adjusted rates shall take effect on the same date as the adjusted BPA rates.

 Section 8. Starting in September of 2001 and continuing on a quarterly basis, City Light shall submit to the Energy and Environmental Policy Committee a brief report summarizing its cumulative power costs and the incremental revenues generated from the three power cost adjustments that have been instituted to offset these costs. Formal briefings regarding the status of the Power Cost Adjustment will be scheduled by the Chair of the Energy and Environmental Policy Committee. These quarterly reports will supplant reporting requirements established in Section 10 of Ordinance 120149.

 Section 9. The provisions of this ordinance are declared to be separate and severable. If any one or more of the provisions of this ordinance shall be declared by any court of competent jurisdiction to be contrary to law, then such provision or provisions shall be null and void and severed from the rest of this ordinance, and all other provisions of this ordinance shall remain valid and enforceable.

 Section 10. This ordinance shall take effect and be in force thirty (30) days from and after its approval by the Mayor, but if not approved and returned by the Mayor within ten (10) days after presentation, it shall take effect as provided by Municipal Code Section 1.04.020.
