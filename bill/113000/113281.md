 AMENDMENT No. ____

 The June 30, 1995, Golf Course Operation Agreement Between the City of Seattle and Municipal Golf of Seattle is amended as follows:

 1. ARTICLE XIII, ASSIGNMENT, is amended to read as follows:

 A. Assignments; Generally. MGS shall not assign or transfer this Agreement without the prior written approval of the City. Any such assignment shall be specifically subject to all terms and provisions of this Agreement. In the event of any proposed assignment of the Agreement, MGS shall cause to be delivered to the city simultaneously with such proposed assignment, as instrument in writing, executed by the assignees, in which the assignees shall assume and agree to perform all of the terms and provisions of this Agreement.

 B. Assignment for Capital Improvement Loan. Notwithstanding the restrictions of Section XIII.A., MGS may assign this Agreement to a reputable lending institution solely for the purpose of securing funds to implement the latest approved Five-Year Capital Improvement Plan required by Section V.H.3. The terms and conditions of such assignment may permit, in the event of MGS's default on the loan, the further assignment of the rights of MGS or the lender in the Golf Course Operation Agreement, provided that any such further assignment shall be subject to approval by the City Council by ordinance. MGS shall provide the City with such additional information and documents as the Superintendent or City Council determines are necessary for their review. The City, through the Superintendent shall inform MGS of such changes, if any, that the City requires to make the loan acceptable to the City. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing sentence, the assignment shall include a default provision whereby the City shall have the option to pay off the loan.

 If the City exercises its option to pay off the loan, the City shall have the right to terminate this Agreement and install a new golf course operator. In the event of such a termination, MGS or its assignee shall, without further consideration, transfer ownership of all improvements (whether completed or under construction), materials, supplies, equipment, inventory, cash, receivables, accounts, contracts, rights, designs, reports, books, and any other assets (tangible and intangible), documents or records (electronic or hard copy) related to the construction or operation of the Golf Courses and its obligations under this Agreement. MGS or its assignee shall take all steps, execute such documents and render such other assistance to facilitate the quick and orderly transfer of such assets to the City.

 IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the City and MGS have executed this amendment by having their authorized representatives affix their signatures in the spaces below.

 THIS AGREEMENT dated as of July ___, 2000, between Frontier Bank, a Washington banking corporation (Lender), Municipal Golf of Seattle, a Washington Not-for-Profit Corporation (Borrower) and The City of Seattle, a Washington municipal corporation (City). Lender, Borrower and City agree as follows:

 I. Facts.

 1.1 Borrower and City entered into a Golf Course Operation Agreement dated June 30, 1995, assigning the right to operate certain golf courses located in Seattle, Washington to Borrower.

 1.3 In a separate document, Borrower is assigning all of its right, privileges and interest under the Golf Course Operation Agreement to Lender to secure a loan in the principal amount of $2,000,000.00, which indebtedness is evidenced by that certain note dated May ____, 2000. Such note, extensions, renewals, modifications and replacements of said note are collectively referred to as the Note.

 II. City's Consent to Assignment.

 City hereby consents to Borrowers assignment of Borrowers interest in the Golf Course Operation Agreement to Lender.

 III. Lenders Rights.

 3.1 Right to Cure Default: Lender shall be entitled to rely on the truthfulness and accuracy of any allegation made by City concerning a breach or default by Borrower in the payment, performance or observance of any of Borrowers obligations under the Golf Course Operation Agreement, to take any action and incur any cost or expense and make any payments that Lender deems appropriate, in its sole discretion, to cure such alleged breach or default.

 3.2 Acceptance of Cure by City: City shall accept from Lender fulfillment of any obligation to be performed by Borrower under the Golf Course Operation Agreement or law.

 3.3 No other Security Interests: City shall not agree to, grant or permit any person or entity to hold any security interest in the Golf Course Operation Agreement nor to succeed to Borrowers interest thereon except Lender or its designee.

 3.4 Lenders Rights Upon Default: If Lender acquires the Borrowers entire interest in the Golf Course Operation Agreement, the Golf Course Operation Agreement shall continue in full force and effect as if Lender were the original grantee of rights under the Agreement, except that the Golf Course Operation Agreement shall be modified in the following respects:

 a. Lender shall be entitled to operate the Golf Courses through a manager or other representative for such period of time as Lender is in good faith attempting to locate an assignee reasonably acceptable to the City who is ready, willing and able to assume the obligations of the Golf Course Operation Agreement then in effect or as the same may be amended by the parties.

 b. Lender shall not be liable nor shall the Golf Course Operation Agreement be terminated for any act or omission of Borrower under the Golf Course Operation Agreement provided Lender promptly undertakes to secure an assignee as described in Section 3.4.a;

 c. Lender shall not be subject to any offsets, defenses or claims which City might have had against Borrower;

 d. Lender shall not be bound by any amendment or modification of the Golf Course Operation Agreement or by any waiver or forbearance on the part of Borrower made or given without the written consent of Lender;

 e. Other than payments owing under the Interim Maintenance Agreement dated June 30, 1995, or a subsequently negotiated Permanent Maintenance Agreement, there shall be no obligation on the part of Lender to remit any sums to City or to the Minimum Capital Improvement Account. The terms of the Interim Maintenance Agreement shall remain in effect and binding until such time as the Permanent Maintenance Agreement is executed by the City and Borrower and approved by Lender, and such approval shall not be unreasonably withheld;

 f. City will have no right to terminate Lender's rights and interests in the Golf Course Operation Agreement under Article XII.B.2 of the Agreement.

 g. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, following a default by MGS, City shall have the option of paying Lender all sums owing under the Note and related loan documents and obtaining a release of Lender's interest in the Golf Course Operation Agreement, and in such event, the Golf Course Operation Agreement shall immediately terminate.

 3.5 Assignment of Lenders Rights: Lender shall have the right to assign its right to operate the Golf Course and other rights under the Golf Course Operation Agreement to a third party ("Assignee") with the prior approval of the City, by ordinance, which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld.

 a. There shall be no requirement that Lender assign its Golf Course Operation Rights only to a non-profit corporation. Lender may assign its Golf Course Operation Rights to any individual or entity, including a for-profit corporation.

 b. The Assignee shall be subject to the terms of the Golf Course Operation Agreement and shall be responsible for curing any defaults existing under that Agreement at the time of the assignment; provided, the City will allow any monetary defaults to be cured on a pro-rata basis over the remaining term of the Golf Course Operation Agreement.

 c. Upon the request of Lender, City will renegotiate the terms of the Golf Course Operation Agreement to make it possible to locate an Assignee. The terms subject to renegotiation shall include, but shall not necessarily be limited to, the length of the remaining term of the Golf Course Operation Agreement, the amount and timing of payments required to be made to the City, cure of defaults and/or the contribution to capital improvements under the Golf Course Operation Agreement.

 d. If the Lender and City are not able to reach an agreement on the terms of a renegotiated Golf Course Operation Agreement, the matter shall be submitted to binding arbitration before the American Arbitration Association. Each party shall bear its own costs and expenses associated with such arbitration.

 e. Lender shall have the right to operate the Golf Courses through a manager or other representative without any obligation to cure defaults or make payments to the City except as provided in paragraph 3.4.e., above, during the period of time Lender and the City are attempting to renegotiate the terms of the Golf Course Operation Agreement, engaged in an arbitration proceeding, or otherwise attempting to locate an Assignee.

 3.6 If Borrower disaffirms or rejects the Golf Course Operation Agreement in bankruptcy proceedings, at the request of Lender or its Assignee, the City and Lender or its Assignee shall promptly sign, acknowledge and deliver a Golf Course Operation Agreement between the City, as assignor, and Lender, or its successor, as Assignee, containing the same terms and provisions as the original Golf Course Operation Agreement, together with the modifications set forth in paragraph 3.4 (a) through (f) above, with a term which would expire on the same date the term of the original Golf Course Operation Agreement would expire, subject to any renewal or extension rights provided for in the Golf Course Operation Agreement.

 3.7 City shall not terminate the Golf Course Operation Agreement on account of any default by the Borrower, unless and until City gives Lender or its Assignee written notice of the default and an opportunity to cure the default or acquire the Borrower's entire interest in the Golf Course Operation Agreement within a period of 60 days from the receipt of the notice. If the default is one that cannot reasonably be cured by Lender within such 60 days, the City shall not terminate the Golf Course Operation Agreement so long as Lender has undertaken a good faith effort to cure the default or acquire Borrowers entire interest in the Golf Course Operation Agreement and diligently pursues the same to completion.

 3.8 Nothing contained in this Section 3 imposes upon the Lender any obligation to cure any default on behalf of the Borrower.

 IV. Limitation on Lender's Liability.

 Neither the Lender nor its Assignee shall be required to assume any of the obligations of the Borrower under the Golf Course Operation Agreement unless the Lender or its Assignee exercises its rights under the Assignment of Golf Course Operation Agreement and assumes responsibility for golf course operations. Under no circumstances shall Lender be required to assume any of the obligations of Borrower which arise after Lender makes a bona fide assignment of Borrowers interest under the Golf Course Operation Agreement.

 V. Modification of Golf Course Operation Agreement.

 The Golf Course Operation Agreement shall not be surrendered, modified or amended without the prior written consent of Lender or its Assignee.

 VI. Miscellaneous.

 6.1 Except for the specific modifications set forth in this Agreement, the provisions of the Golf Course Operation Agreement remain in full force and effect.

 6.2 This Agreement shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the parties to this Agreement and their successors and assigns.
