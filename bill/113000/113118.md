 AN ORDINANCE related to the 2000 adopted budget; making appropriations for the operation of the SeaPark Garage in 2000 and for the payment in 2000 of debt service from the Municipal Civic Center Fund; all by a three-fourths vote of the City Council.

 WHEREAS, Ordinance 119722 authorized the Director of the Executive Services Department to negotiate for and acquire the property commonly known as the SeaPark Garage by negotiation or condemnation in order to carry out the Civic Center Master Plan; and

 WHEREAS, the City has negotiated a purchase in lieu of condemnation of the SeaPark Garage with the owner, and Ordinance 119849 authorized execution of a purchase and sale agreement and acceptance of a deed for that property; and

 WHEREAS, once the City acquires the SeaPark Garage, the Executive Services Department will have responsibility for operating the garage, and the Executive Services Fund will receive both internal and external revenues from its operation; and

 WHEREAS, expenditure authority is needed to pay for the anticipated operating expenses of the SeaPark Garage for the remainder of 2000; and

 WHEREAS, during the remainder of 2000, the operating revenues from the SeaPark Garage are expected to be sufficient to provide $500,000 towards the cost of paying debt service (principal and interest) on the bonds authorized by Ordinance 119630, a portion of the proceeds of which were used, pursuant to Ordinance 119849, to acquire the SeaPark Garage; and

 WHEREAS, due to expected investment earnings on the proceeds of limited tax general obligation bonds sold in 1999, the Municipal Civic Center Fund should pay a portion of debt service during 2000 on those bonds; Now therefore,

To pay costs associated with the operation of the SeaPark Garage, there is hereby appropriated from the Facility Services program category (A33) in the Executive Services Fund Five Hundred Thousand Dollars ($500,000) and the expenditure authority in the 2000 budget of the Executive Services Department is increased accordingly.

 Section 2. Due to expected interest earnings on a portion of the proceeds of the 1999 Limited Tax General Obligation Bonds, Series B (Various Purposes), authorized by Ordinance 119630, which were used, in part, to finance implementation of the Civic Center Master Plan, One Million Eight Hundred Thousand Dollars ($1,800,000) is appropriated from the Municipal Civic Center Fund, allocated from its subfunds as deemed appropriate by the Finance Director, for the purpose of paying debt service in 2000 on those bonds. In addition, due to the anticipated sufficiency of revenue from SeaPark Garage operations, Five Hundred Thousand Dollars ($500,000) is hereby appropriated from the Facility Services program category (A33) in the Executive Services Fund also for the purpose of paying debt service in 2000 on these bonds.

 Section 3. Any act consistent with the authority and prior to the effective date of this ordinance is hereby ratified and confirmed.

 Section 4. The appropriations in Sections 1 and 2 above are made to meet actual necessary expenditures of The City of Seattle for which insufficient or no appropriation has been made due to causes which could not have reasonably been foreseen at the time of the making of the 2000 budget.
