 AN ORDINANCE relating to taxation, adopting the provisions of the model business license tax ordinance, creating separate chapters for administrative provisions and definitions governing taxation, repealing chapter 5.44 of the Seattle Municipal Code, and amending and repealing various other sections of the Seattle Municipal Code in connection therewith.

 BE IT ORDAINED BY THE CITY OF SEATTLE AS FOLLOWS:

 SECTION 1. Effective January 1, 2002, Chapter 5.44 of the Seattle Municipal Code is repealed in its entirety.

 SECTION 2. Effective January 1, 2002, a new Chapter 5.45, "Business License Tax", is added to Title 5 of the Seattle Municipal Code as follows:

 5.45.010 Exercise of revenue license power.

 The provisions of this chapter shall be deemed an exercise of the power of the City to license or tax for revenue. The provisions of this chapter are subject to periodic statutory or administrative rule changes or judicial interpretations of the ordinances or rules. The responsibility rests with the licensee or taxpayer to reconfirm tax computation procedures and remain in compliance with the City Code.

 5.45.020 Administrative Provisions.

 All of the provisions contained in Chapter 5.55 of the Seattle Municipal Code shall have full force and application with respect to taxes or license fees imposed under the provisions of this chapter except as expressly stated to the contrary herein.

 5.45.030 Definitions.

 The definitions contained in Chapter 5.30 of the Seattle Municipal Code shall be fully applicable to this chapter except as expressly stated to the contrary herein.

 5.45.040 Agency - Sales and services by agent, consignee, bailee, factor or auctioneer.

 A. Sales in own name - sales or purchases as agent. Every person, including agents, consignees, bailees, factors or auctioneers, having either actual or constructive possession of tangible personal property or having possession of the documents of title thereto, with power to sell such tangible personal property in his or her or its own name and actually so selling shall be deemed the seller of such tangible personal property within the meaning of this chapter.

 The burden shall be upon the taxpayer in every case to establish the fact that such taxpayer is not engaged in the business of selling tangible personal property but is acting merely as broker or agent in promoting sales or making purchases for a principal. Such claim will be recognized only when the contract or agreement between such persons clearly establishes the relationship of principal and agent and when the following conditions are complied with:

 1. The books and records of the broker or agent show the transactions were made in the name and for the account of the principal, and show the name of the actual owner of the property for whom the sale was made, or the actual buyer for whom the purchase was made;

 2. The books and records show the amount of the principal's gross sales, the amount of commissions and any other incidental income derived by the broker or agent from such sales. The principal's gross sales must not be reflected as the agent's income on any of the agent's books and records. Commissions must be computed according to a set percentage or amount, which is agreed upon in the agency agreement;

 3. No ownership rights may be conferred to the agent unless the principal refuses to pay, or refuses to abide by the agency agreement. Sales or purchases of any goods by a person who has any ownership rights in such goods shall be taxed as retail or wholesale sales; and

 4. Bulk goods sold or purchased on behalf of a principal must not be co-mingled with goods belonging to another principal or lose their identity as belonging to the particular principal. Sales or purchases of any goods which have been co-mingled or lost their identity as belonging to the principal shall be taxed as retail or wholesale sales.

 B. If the requirements in subsection A above are not met, the consignor, bailor, principal or other shall be deemed a seller of such property to the agent, consignee, bailee, factor or auctioneer.

 C. Services in own name - procuring services as agent. For purposes of this subsection, SMC Section 5.45.040 C, an agent is a person who acts under the direction and control of the principal in procuring services on behalf of the principal that the person could not itself render or supply. Amounts received by an agent for the account of its principal as advances or reimbursements are exempted from the measure of the tax only when the agent is not primarily or secondarily liable to pay for the services procured.

 Any person who claims to be acting merely as agent in obtaining services for a principal will have such claim recognized only when the contract or agreement between such persons clearly establishes the relationship of principal and agent and when the following conditions are complied with:

 1. The books and records of the agent show that the services were obtained in the name and for the account of the principal, and show the actual principal for whom the purchase was made; and

 2. The books and records show the amount of the service that was obtained for the principal, the amount of commissions and any other income derived by the agent for acting as such. Amounts received from the principal as advances and reimbursements must not be reflected as the agent's income on any of the agent's books and records. Commissions must be computed according to a set percentage or amount, which is agreed upon in the agency agreement.

 5.45.050 Imposition of the tax - Tax or fee levied.

 There is hereby levied upon and shall be collected from every person as hereinafter provided, for the act or privilege of engaging in business activities within the City, whether his or her office or place of business be within or without the City, a business and occupation tax or fee, sometimes herein referred to as the "tax." The tax shall be in amounts to be determined by application of rates against gross proceeds of sale, gross income of business, or value of products, including by-products, as the case may be, as follows:

 A. Upon every person engaging within the City in business as an extractor; as to such persons the amount of the tax with respect to such business shall be equal to the value of the products, including by-products, extracted for sale or for commercial or industrial use, multiplied by the rate of two hundred fifteen one- thousandths of one percent (.00215). The measure of the tax is the value of the products, including by-products, so extracted, regardless of the place of sale or the fact that deliveries may be made to points outside the City.

 B. Upon every person engaging within the City in business as a manufacturer, except persons taxable under subsection D of this Section; as to such persons the amount of the tax with respect to such business shall be equal to the value of the products, including by-products, manufactured or processed, multiplied by the rate of two hundred fifteen one-thousandths of one percent (.00215). The measure of the tax is the value of the products, including by-products, so manufactured or processed, regardless of the place of sale or the fact that deliveries may be made to points outside the City.

 C. Upon every person engaging within the City in the business of making sales at wholesale or retail (including public road construction), except persons taxable under subsection D of this section; as to such persons, the amount of tax with respect to such business shall be equal to the gross proceeds of such sales of the business without regard to the place of delivery of articles, commodities or merchandise sold, multiplied by the rate of two hundred fifteen one-thousandths of one percent (.00215).

 D. Upon every person engaging within the City in the business of:

 1. Buying wheat, oats, corn, barley and rye, but not including any manufactured or processed products thereof, and selling the same at wholesale, the tax imposed shall be equal to the gross proceeds of such sales of the business without regard to the place of delivery of articles, commodities or merchandise sold, multiplied by the rate of two hundred fifteen ten-thousandths of one percent (.000215); or

 2. Manufacturing wheat into flour; the tax imposed shall be equal to the value of the flour manufactured, multiplied by the rate of two hundred fifteen ten-thousandths of one percent (.000215).

 E. Upon every person engaging within the City in the business of:

 1. printing;

 2. both printing and publishing newspapers, magazines, periodicals, books, music, and other items;

 3. publishing newspapers, magazines and periodicals;

 4. processing for hire; or

 5. conducting a tour operator business;

 as to such persons, the amount of tax on such business shall be equal to the gross income of the business multiplied by the rate of two hundred fifteen one-thousandths of one percent (.00215).

 F. Upon every other person engaging within the City in any business activity other than or in addition to those enumerated in the above subsections; as to such persons, the amount of tax on account of such activities shall be equal to the gross income of the business multiplied by the rate of four hundred fifteen one- thousandths of one percent (.00415). This subsection includes, among others, and without limiting the scope hereof (whether or not title to material used in the performance of such business passes to another by accession, merger or other than by outright sale), persons engaged in the business of developing, or producing custom software or of customizing canned software, and persons engaged in the business of rendering any type of service which does not constitute a sale at retail or a sale at wholesale.

 5.45.060 Doing business with the City.

 Except where such a tax is otherwise levied and collected by the City from such person, there is hereby levied a tax on the privilege of accepting or executing a contract with the City involving the sale to the City of materials, supplies, equipment, improvements or contractual services. Such tax shall be levied and collected whether the goods or services are delivered within or without the City and whether or not such person has an office or place of business within or without the City.

 As to such persons the amount of tax shall be equal to the gross contract price multiplied by the rate under SMC Section 5.45.050 that would otherwise apply if the sale or service were taxable pursuant to that section. The gross contract price shall be allocated to the city with which the contract is made. No other city shall have jurisdiction to tax the gross receipts from such contract. The gross contract price may not be reduced by the deduction contained in SMC Section 5.45.100 Q or the interstate deduction SMC Section 5.45.100 T.

 A. The tax levied in this section shall not be levied when:

 1. The aggregate value of all City contracts with the person during the calendar year is Five Thousand Dollars ($5,000) or less, or

 2. The person's only source of revenue consists of contracts with the City for neighborhood planning purposes, sister city associations, or Arts Commission grants, and is less than the taxable threshold amount provided in SMC Section 5.55.040 D.

 B. All persons subject to this section, other than those exempted by subsection (A) above, are required to obtain and maintain a business license as prescribed by SMC Section 5.55.030.

 D. All persons are required to pay in full all taxes or fees due under this chapter on account of such contract, or otherwise, before accepting any warrant as final payment for performing any contract for the City. The Director of Finance may withhold payment due a City contractor pending satisfactory resolution of unpaid taxes and fees due the City under this title.

 5.45.070 Multiple activities credit when activities take place in one or more cities with eligible gross receipt taxes.

 A. Persons who engage in business activities that are within the purview of two (2) or more subsections of SMC Section 5.45.050 shall be taxable under each applicable subsection.

 B. If imposition of the City's tax would place an undue burden upon interstate commerce or violate constitutional requirements, a taxpayer shall be allowed a credit to the extent necessary to preserve the validity of the City's tax, and still apply the City tax to as much of the taxpayer's activities as may be subject to the City's taxing authority.

 C. To take the credit authorized by this section, a taxpayer must be able to document that the amount of tax sought to be credited was paid upon the same gross receipts used in computing the tax against which the credit is applied and that the taxpayer paid the amount of tax sought to be credited. In order to qualify as an "eligible gross receipts tax," the tax must be imposed at the local level.

 D. Credit for persons that sell in the City products that they extract or manufacture. Persons taxable under the retailing or wholesaling classification with respect to selling products in this City shall be allowed a credit against those taxes for any eligible gross receipts taxes paid:

 1. with respect to the manufacturing of the products sold in the City; and

 2. with respect to the extracting of the products, or the ingredients used in the products, sold in the City.

 The amount of the credit shall not exceed the tax liability arising under this chapter with respect to the sale of those products.

 E. Credit for persons that manufacture products in the City using ingredients they extract. Persons taxable under the manufacturing classification with respect to manufacturing products in this City shall be allowed a credit against those taxes for any eligible gross receipts tax paid with respect to extracting the ingredients of the products manufactured in the City. The amount of the credit shall not exceed the tax liability arising under this chapter with respect to the manufacturing of those products.

 F. Credit for persons that sell within the City products that they print, or publish and print. Persons taxable under the retailing or wholesaling classification with respect to selling products in this City shall be allowed a credit against those taxes for any eligible gross receipts taxes paid with respect to the printing, or the printing and publishing, of the products sold within the City. The amount of the credit shall not exceed the tax liability arising under this chapter with respect to the sale of those products.

 5.45.080 Persons conducting business both within and without the City.

 Where SMC 5.45.100 Q (pertaining to the allocation of gross income between jurisdictions that impose an eligible gross receipts tax) does not apply:

 A. A person who maintains an office or place of business in the City shall be taxable on the gross income, gross proceeds from sales, or value of products, that is derived from the business activities rendered by, generated from, or attributable to the office or place of business located within the City, unless specific deductions or exemptions apply.

 B. A person who maintains an office or place of business in the City and also elsewhere may allocate to the office or place of business located outside the City that portion of the taxpayer's gross income, gross proceeds of sales, or value of products derived from business activities rendered by, generated from, or attributable to the office or place of business located outside the City. The taxpayer shall allocate gross income to the City based on a segregation of business within and business without the City, as shown and supported by accounting records satisfactory to the Director.

 If the Director determines that the allocation of gross income from business reported under the "other business activities" classification (SMC 5.45.050(F)) does not fairly reflect gross income derived from business activities within the City, the Director shall determine such gross income by either of the following methods: (a) by a fair and equitable formula agreed upon by the Director and the taxpayer after a consideration of the facts; or (b) by the ratio that the cost of doing business within the City bears to the cost of doing business both within and without the City.

 C. A person performing business activities in the City who does not maintain an office or place of business in the City shall allocate to the City that portion of the taxpayer's gross income or gross proceeds of sales that is derived from business activities performed in the City.

 F. Compensation from public entities for health or social welfare services-exception.

 A. Taxes shall be paid to the Director in United States currency by bank draft, certified check, cashier's check, personal check, money order, cash, or by wire transfer or electronic payment if such wire transfer or electronic payment is authorized by the Director. If payment so received is not paid by the bank on which it is drawn, the taxpayer, by whom such payment is tendered, shall remain liable for payment of the tax and for all legal penalties, the same as if such payment had not been tendered. Acceptance of any sum by the Director shall not discharge the tax or fee due unless the amount paid is the full amount due.

 B. A return or remittance which is transmitted to the City by United States mail shall be deemed filed or received on the date shown by the cancellation mark stamped by the Post Office upon the envelope containing it.

Any license issued upon payment with a NSF check will be considered void, and shall be returned to the Director. No license shall be reissued until payment (including the Twenty Dollars ($20.00) NSF fee) is received.

The Director is authorized to determine the amount of the tax or fees payable by obtaining facts and information upon which to base the estimate of the tax or fees due. Such fee or tax assessment shall be deemed prima facie correct and shall be the amount of tax owing the City by the taxpayer.

In case of a deficiency assessment the interest shall be computed from the first day of the month following each calendar year or portion thereof included in the audit period. The rate of interest to be charged to the taxpayer shall be an average of the federal short- term rate as defined in 26 U.S.C. Sec. 1274(d) plus two (2) percentage points. The rate shall be computed by taking an arithmetical average to the nearest percentage point of the federal short-term rate, compounded annually, for the months of January, April, July, and October of the year immediately preceding the calendar year as published by the United States Secretary of the Treasury. The rate shall be adjusted on the first day of January of each year for use in computing interest for that calendar year.

Except as provided in subsection (B) of this section, no refund or credit shall be made for taxes, penalties, or interest paid more than four (4) years prior to the beginning of the calendar year in which the refund application is made or examination of records is completed.

 B. The execution of a written waiver, pursuant to SMC 5.55.095, shall extend the time for applying for, or making, a refund or credit of any taxes paid during, or attributable to, the years covered by the waiver if, prior to the expiration of the waiver period, an application for refund of such taxes is made by the taxpayer or the Director discovers that a refund or credit is due.

 C. Refunds shall be made by means of vouchers approved by the Director and by the issuance of a City check, warrant, or wire transfer drawn upon and payable from such funds as the City may provide.

 B. Any person who becomes a successor shall be liable for the full amount of any tax owing. The successor shall withhold from the purchase price a sum sufficient to pay any tax due to the City from the taxpayer until such time as:

 2. more than six (6) months has passed since the successor notified the Director of the acquisition and the Director has not issued and notified the successor of an assessment.

 C. Payment of the tax by the successor shall, to the extent thereof, be deemed a payment upon the purchase price. If such payment is greater in amount than the purchase price, the amount of the difference shall become a debt due such successor from the taxpayer.

 D. Notwithstanding the above, if a successor gives written notice to the Director of the acquisition, and the Department does not within six (6) months of the date it received the notice issue an assessment against the taxpayer and mail a copy of that assessment to the successor, the successor shall not be liable for the tax.

C.~~D.~~ A deduction from gross income shall be allowed, only to cellular telephone service companies who keep their regular books of account on an accrual basis, for credit losses actually sustained by a taxpayer as a result of cellular telephone service business. ~~which shall be phased in as follows: twenty (20) percent of the credit losses occurring in 1995; forty (40) percent of the credit losses occurring in 1996; sixty (60) percent of the credit losses occurring in 1997; and eighty (80) percent of the credit losses occurring in1998; and a complete deduction for the credit losses occurring in1999 and thereafter.~~

 SECTION 21. Effective January 1, 2002, Section 5.48.260 of the Seattle Municipal Code is amended as follows:

 5.48.260 Allocation of revenues - Cellular telephone service.

 A. ~~Service address.~~ In determining the total gross income from telephone business in the City for purposes of Section 5.48.050A, there shall be included all gross income from cellular telephone service (including roaming charges incurred by Seattle customers outside this state) provided to customers whose  "place of primary use"~~principal service address~~ is in the City, regardless of the location of the facilities used to provide the service. The customer's "~~principal service address~~place of primary use" is, with respect to each telephone: (a) the customer's ~~plant, store, office, or other facility where the telephone is normally assigned for use in conjunction with the customer's business activity;~~ address; or (b) the customer's place of residence if the telephone is for personal use, and in both cases must be located within the licensed service area of the home service provider. Roaming charges and cellular telephone charges to customers whose principle service address is outside Seattle will not be taxable even though those mobile services are provided within Seattle.

 B. There is a rebuttable presumption that the ~~principal service~~"place of primary use" address shown on the cellular telephone service company's records is accurate. If the cellular telephone service company knows or should have known that a customer's ~~principal service~~place of primary use address for a telephone is within the City then the gross revenue from cellular telephone service provided to that customer with respect to that telephone is to be included in the company's gross income.

~~C. Non-Washington roaming phones. In determining the total gross income from telephone business in the City for purposes of Section 5.48.050A, there shall be included all gross income from cellular telephone services rendered to customers using non- Washington telephones (which means cellular telephones with principal service addresses outside the state) through the use of switching facilities located in the City. In the event technological advances result in a cellular telephone service company's accounting system accurately assigning revenue from such a customer's call to the location of the originating cell site rather than to the location of the main cellular switching office that switched the call, and the company has elected to report, to all taxing jurisdictions throughout Washington State, its revenues from non-Washington telephones according to the location of the originating cell site, then that company's gross revenue for purposes of Section 5.48.050A shall, instead of the preceding sentence, include all gross income from services rendered to customers using non-Washington telephones derived from calls originating in cell sites within the City.~~D. Dispute resolution. If there is a dispute between or among the City and another city or cities as to the principal service address for a customer's cellular telephone service, or any other matter concerning allocation of revenues, and the dispute is not resolved by negotiation among the parties, then the dispute shall be resolved by the City and the other city or cities through the Association of Washington Cities. Once taxes on the disputed revenues have been paid to one (1) of the contesting cities, the cellular telephone service company shall have no further liability with respect to additional taxes, penalties, or interest on the disputed revenues so long as it promptly changes its billing records for future revenues to comport with the settlement facilitated by the Association of Washington Cities.
