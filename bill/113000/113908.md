 Section 1. Seattle Municipal Code Chapter 4.20, Section 4.20.430, Ordinance 119411 as amended is hereby amended as follows:

 4.20.430 Information Technology Professional (ITP) Compensation Program-Description

 A. There is established an Information Technology Professional Compensation Program to which positions identified as "Information Technology Professional" are assigned. The Personnel Director is authorized to administer the Information Technology Professional Compensation Program and to develop and maintain a plan document that describes the program elements.

 B. The Personnel Director shall recommend to the City Council for approval, market adjustments to the pay zones annually. The market adjustment will be based upon labor market analysis of selected benchmark positions to be conducted as needed, and/or at least

 every two (2) years with the biennial budget. Program incumbents will receive an adjustment to their base salary to retain a competitive position in the labor market. No ITP incumbent shall be eligible for such an adjustment if his or her performance in the most recent evaluation cycle failed to be described as "satisfactory" or better. Other adjustments to base salaries must be made in accordance with Program Guidelines and within budget and spending guidelines.

 C. The Personnel Director will assign positions within the Information Technology Professional category to a pay zone.

 D. Each employee in the Information Technology Professional Compensation Program will be assigned a base rate of pay within the pay zone by the appointing authority, upon the Personnel Director's approval. If during the initial program implementation in January 2000 the rate of pay received by an incumbent immediately prior to assignment to the Information Technology Professional Compensation Program is higher than the upper limit of the pay zone recommended by the Personnel Director, or is higher than the rate established for the position by the appointing authority, the employee will retain an incumbency rate of pay in

 such position until any market adjustments to the pay zone equal or exceed the incumbency rate.; provided, the incumbency rating shall be maintained only as long as the duties assigned to the position are commensurate with the rate of pay.

 E. The appointing authority may recommend a premium of up to twenty-five (25) percent of base salary, not to exceed one hundred twenty-five (125) percent of the maximum rate of Pay Zone A to any employee appointed to an IT Professional A exempt position in the Information Technology Professional Compensation Program. The Personnel Director has the authority to approve or discontinue the premium.. The premium shall be considered part of regular compensation for purposes of withholding retirement contributions and determining retirement benefits for affected employees who are members of the City Employees Retirement System.

 F. For positions in the Information Technology Professional CompensationProgram that are included in the City's classified service, "Information Technology Professional" shall constitute the class series and the pay zone shall constitute the classification for all relevant provisions of the Seattle Municipal Code and Personnel Rules.

 Section 2. This Ordinance shall take effect and be in force thirty (30) days from and after its approval by the Mayor, but if not approved and returned by the Mayor within ten (10) days after presentation, it shall take effect as provided by Municipal Code Section 1.04.020.
