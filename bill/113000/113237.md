 ORDINANCE ______

 AN ORDINANCE relating to the City Light Department; authorizing the Mayor to enter into an agreement with the Public Utility District No. 1 of Pend Oreille County that commits the District to support Seattle's effort to relicense the Boundary Project and commits Seattle to continue delivery of up to 48 MW of power to the District from the Boundary Project for the term of a new federal license.

 WHEREAS, the 50-year federal license for Seattle's Boundary Project will expire in 2011; and

 WHEREAS, the initial licensing effort for the Boundary Project was marred by protracted disputes between Seattle and the District over which public agency should be allowed to develop a new hydroelectric project on the Pend Oreille River, just south of the Canadian border; and

 WHEREAS, in 1961, the Federal Power Commission (now the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission) issued a new license for such a project to Seattle rather than the District; and

 WHEREAS, upon reconsideration of the original license conditions, the Commission added Article 49 to Seattle's license which gave the District the right to receive up to 48 MW of power from the Boundary Project, at cost, at the District's load factor; and

 WHEREAS, in the late 1980s, the District began taking delivery of its entitlement under Article 49 to serve newly developed industry in the District's service area; and

 WHEREAS, over the last ten years, Seattle and the District have worked together with increasing effectiveness as public power agencies; and

 WHEREAS, the agreement authorized by this ordinance will provide both Seattle and the District with certainty of mutual support during the federal relicensing process for the Boundary Project and with mutual benefits throughout the term of the new license; Now Therefore,

 BE IT ORDAINED BY THE CITY OF SEATTLE AS FOLLOWS:

 Section 1. The Mayor is hereby authorized to enter into an agreement with the Public Utility District No. 1 of Pend Oreille County, substantially in the form of the "Memorandum of Agreement" attached to this ordinance. The Agreement commits the District to support Seattle's effort to relicense the Boundary Project. Seattle in turn pledges to support retaining a slightly modified form of Article 49 of the Boundary license in any new federal license. Article 49 allows the District to take up to 48 MW of power from the Boundary Project at cost at the District's system load factor for use in the District's service territory. The modified form of Article 49 would eliminate the geographic restriction on the use of that power and formalize the current operating agreement whereby Seattle delivers the power at the District's weekly load factor.

 In addition, the agreement commits Seattle to deliver up to 48 MW of power from Boundary to the District, even if a modified version of Article 49 should not be retained in a new license. In return, the District agrees to limit its request and delivery from the Boundary Project to 48 MW, even if a new Article 49, or its equivalent, in a new license should grant the District access to greater than 48 MW of power.

 Section 2. Any action taken in furtherance of this ordinance, prior to its effective date, is hereby ratified and confirmed.

 Section 3. This ordinance shall take effect and be in force thirty (30) days from and after its approval by the Mayor, but if not approved and returned by the Mayor within ten (10) days after presentation, it shall take effect as provided by Municipal Code Section 1.04.020.

 ISSUES BRIEF

 Pend Oreille County PUD Support for Boundary Project Relicensing

 Date: May 1, 2000

 Supersedes: NA

 Introduction

 The City of Seattle's federal license for Boundary Hydroelectric Project will expire on July 1, 2011. The City Light Department has begun planning for extending the license of this highly productive, low-cost resource and has sought the support of the Public Utility District No. 1 of Pend Oreille County ("POPUD") to support our relicensing. This Issues Brief describes a proposed memorandum of agreement by which POPUD will support City Light's relicensing efforts.

 Background

 * In October 1953, the City of Seattle ("City") filed with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission ("FERC") an application for a preliminary permit for a major hydroelectric development on the Pend Oreille River designated the Boundary Project (No. 2144). A preliminary permit was issued in 1954.

 * In 1956, City Light executed a Power Purchase Contract with POPUD to purchase surplus firm power from the Box Canyon Project through August 1, 2005.

 * In July 1957, POPUD filed an application for the license of a competing project on the Pend Oreille River at Z Canyon, but FERC rejected such application because the City already held a preliminary permit for the Boundary Project in the same vicinity. Soon thereafter, the City filed the application for a license for the construction and operation of the Boundary Project.

 * Later that year, POPUD filed a petition to intervene in Project No. 2144 together with a competing plan for a dam and power plant at the Z Canyon site. FERC permitted this intervention.

 * Finally, in March 1961 FERC issued a 50-year license to the City for the Boundary Project. The order was ultimately modified in September 1961 to add the following provision:

 Article 49. The Licensee shall assign 48,000 kilowatts to the PUD from the Boundary Project at the PUD's system load factor, any part or all of which shall be available to the PUD at cost upon two years' notice by the PUD, to meet the load requirements of present or potential consumers (not including purchases for resale) within the PUD's service area; Provided, That the amount of power made available by this article shall be reduced by the amount of any power recaptured by the PUD under the Box Canyon Contract with Seattle and sold for use outside Pend Oreille County.

 * In September 1969, POPUD and City Light executed an agreement to settle several issues between the parties ("Box Canyon Settlement Agreement"). This Agreement also tied the Boundary obligation to the Box Canyon contract so that POPUD's withdrawal rights under both could be coordinated and predictable for both parties.

 * Due to the moderate level of loads in the POPUD service area, there was no request made to City Light for Boundary Withdrawals until 1983. At that time, POPUD sent the required advance Notice of Withdrawal of Boundary Power in 1985 for the construction of a paper mill and fiber mill plant at Usk. The parties began to discuss an appropriate methodology for determining the "at cost" power price.

 * Power deliveries pursuant to Article 49 finally began at 24 MW in 1989, after multiple years of interim agreements and a final decision by FERC on the application and interpretation of the license assignment. The Settlement Agreement for the Article 49 Power Assignment to Pend Oreille Public Utility District No. 1 by the City of Seattle was executed in 1992. It extends through the term of the current Boundary License, July 1, 2011.

 * Article 49 deliveries to POPUD increased to 28 MW in 1992, to 32 MW in 1995, and are expected to increase to 36 in August 2000 and finally to the full 48 MW in August 2005, concurrent with the expiration of the Box Canyon Power Purchase Contract.

 * In the last five years, POPUD has taken an average of 243,601 MWh of Boundary Project power each year, for which it paid City Light on average $704,861 per year, which amounts to less than 0.29 cents per kilowatt hour. This is lower than City Light's total cost of Boundary is 0.48 center per kilowatt hour under the formula used in the FERC Order, because POPUD receives power at their system load factor (88%), which is higher than the power plant load factor (43%). (The load factor is the ratio of average energy to peak.)

 Recent Developments

 * Last year, in the spirit of cooperation and seeking support of the POPUD for City Light's relicensing efforts for Boundary Project, the parties began to discuss mutually beneficial terms that might be included in a license extension after July 1, 2011. The parties exchanged letters outlining the understanding, but eventually agreed that it was important to memorialize the terms of this quid pro quo arrangement in a Memorandum of Agreement.

 * In the proposed Memorandum of Agreement, City Light and POPUD agree to include in the succeeding Boundary license the current provisions and interpretation of Article 49, with the exception that the restriction on the use of Article 49 power within POPUD's service area would be lifted. In exchange, POPUD has promised to commit to full support of such an agreement and assist the City of Seattle in its Boundary relicensing.

 * Even more important, POPUD would agree to contract language that would limit its Boundary Withdrawals to no more than 48 MW, whether or not a revised version of Article 49 is included in the succeeding FERC license. In turn, City Light would agree to make available 48 MW to POPUD even in the unlikely event that Article 49 is eliminated from the next Boundary License.

 Implications for City Light

 * The proposed contract with POPUD would reduce the risk of a competitive license application for Boundary Project because PUD will affirmatively support City Light's.

 * Under the proposed agreement, City Light would commit to make available 48 MW to POPUD even if such a requirement is not stipulated in the license.

 * The SCL replacement cost of this power at $30/mwh is $11 million, and POPUD would pay SCL approximately $1 million. The $10 million net cost of the obligation could only be reduced if the City was successful in eliminating or reducing its Article 49 obligation from its future license, an event which is highly unlikely.

 * The net cost to SCL could be greater than $10 million if POPUD is successful in convincing FERC that SCL should increase its Article 49 obligation in light of changes in the last 50 years.

 Next Steps/Schedule

 * The POPUD General Manager, Larry Weiss, has announced he will be leaving the utility July 1. If we concur with the proposed approach, it is probably in our interests to complete this transaction before the management change takes effect at POPUD.

 Key Messages

 * Although this agreement commits both parties to a substantial limitation of their future interests, both parties recognize that there are considerable risks associated with what may happen in a complex federal regulatory process ten years from now. Seattle recognizes that it is highly unlikely that FERC would discontinue or substantially reduce the Article 49 condition. POPUD realizes the benefit of being able to count on a firm power supply after our relicensing. Both parties benefit from the certainty this agreement provides. Early commitment to our mutual interests should facilitate the relicensing process.
