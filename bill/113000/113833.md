Purchaser may suspend its duty to accept and pay for Energy and Environmental Attributes under this Agreement if and to the extent, at any time during the Term, the Project, Expansion Project, and/or any project that delivers Additional Energy and Option Energy and Environmental Attributes under this Agreement, (a) in fact fails to comply in any material respect with any federal, state or local law, regulation or ordinance applicable to such project, and (b) Seller cannot cause the developer of such project or its lender to cure such failure to comply within forty (40) Days after Purchaser receives notice from the Seller describing the default in reasonable detail; provided, however, that if the failure to comply is not reasonably capable of being cured within the forty-day cure period, the developer of such project or its lender will have additional time to cure the event of non-compliance if either (i) commences to cure the failure within the forty-day cure period, (ii) diligently pursues the cure, and (iii) the failure is capable of being cured and is in fact cured within no more than one-hundred ninety (190) Days after the Seller receives notice of the failure from Purchaser. The suspension would commence at the end of the 40-day cure period, unless the cure period is extended as contemplated by the proviso set forth in the preceding sentence (in which case the suspension would commence at the end of such extended cure period). If Seller is relying on the project developer's or lender's commencement of a cure within the forty (40) day cure period and subsequent diligent pursuit of the cure in accordance with the proviso set forth above, Seller shall provide Purchaser with reasonably detailed information concerning the commencement of the cure and anticipated diligent pursuit of the cure on or before the 41st day following Purchaser's notice. Seller shall provide updates of such information as reasonably requested by the Purchaser. If the failure to comply with law affects fewer than all of the wind generating projects that supply Energy and Environmental Attributes under this Agreement, Purchaser's suspension right shall extend only to Energy and Environmental Attributes produced by the project(s) so affected. Upon receipt of a reasonably detailed notice of failure to comply from Purchaser, Seller shall forward the notice or a substantially similar statement of Purchaser's concern to the developer of such project. Any such suspension of Purchaser's duty to accept and pay for Energy and Environmental Attributes under this Agreement shall expire two Business Days after (a) the project developer or the lender corrects the non-compliance described in Purchaser's notice, and (b) the Seller gives Purchaser notice that the non-compliance has been corrected. If any suspension under this Section 2.3.3 continues for a period of more than one hundred eighty (180) Days, Seller shall have the right to terminate this Agreement in its sole discretion. A suspension shall not extend the term of this Agreement, and neither Party shall be required to make up the suspended deliveries of Energy and Environmental Attributes.

 2.4 Notice of Termination. If a Party elects to terminate this Agreement under Section 2.3, it shall give the other Party at least fifteen (15) Days prior written notice of the termination date, unless a longer period is expressly required by Section 2.3.

 2.5 Effect of Termination. Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement to the contrary, if a Party terminates this Agreement under Section 2.3, the Parties shall be released and discharged from any obligations arising or accruing under this Agreement from and after the date of such termination, but only to the extent of such termination.

 2.6 Effect of Suspension. Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement to the contrary, if Purchaser suspends this Agreement under Section 2.3.3, (a) the Purchaser shall be released and discharged from any obligations to take and pay for Energy and Environmental Attributes under this Agreement from and during the period of such suspension, but only to the extent of such suspension, and (b) the Seller shall be released and discharged from any obligations to sell and deliver Energy and Environmental Attributes under this Agreement from and during the period of such suspension, but only to the extent of such suspension.

To the extent that Additional Energy does not satisfy the conditions set forth in Section 4.2.3(d), Seller shall have until one (1) year after the date of each notice respectively to identify substitute wind turbine generating system(s) that will satisfy such conditions and be used to supply Additional Energy. If Seller is unable to do so, Purchaser's duty to take and pay for, and Seller's duty to sell and deliver, such Additional Energy and associated Environmental Attributes shall terminate, but only to the extent of the portion of Additional Energy that does not satisfy the conditions set forth in Section 4.2.3(d).

 4.2.4. Example. An Example illustrating the calculation of Base Energy, Expansion Energy and Additional Energy under certain stated assumptions is set forth in Exhibit B.

 4.2.5. Option Energy.

 (a) Seller shall have the irrevocable right and option to sell to Purchaser additional Energy and Environmental Attributes associated with up to 25 MW of Installed Capacity from wind turbine generating systems (the "Option Energy"). The Option Energy may be stated as a percentage of the capacity of specified wind turbine generating systems.

 (b) To exercise its right to sell and deliver Option Energy, Seller shall give notice to Purchaser on or before July 1, 2003 of Seller's intent to sell and deliver up to 25 MW of Option Energy (the "Option Notice"). Within ten (10) Days after sending the Option Notice, Seller shall specify by notice to Purchaser (i) the point(s) at which Seller will deliver the Option Energy (the "Option Energy Delivery Point(s)"), which point(s) shall be subject to Purchaser's consent (not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed), (ii) the expected monthly and daily generation profile of the Option Energy, shown in MWh, based on the customary and typical meteorological and statistical analysis for developing wind resource projects, and (iii) a description of the wind turbine generating systems that will generate the Option Energy.

 (c) Option Energy may be generated by (i) wind turbine generating systems that are part of an expansion of the Project (but are not part of the Project as described on Exhibit A or the Expansion Project) and that achieve their commercial operation date on or after July 1, 2001, (ii) wind turbine generating systems located within the WSCC that are not part of the Project, the Expansion Project or any other expansion of the Project and that achieve their commercial operation date on or after July 1, 2001, or (iii) any combination of such wind turbine generating systems.

 (d) If Seller exercises its option to supply Option Energy, then beginning on January 1, 2004 and continuing until the end of the Term, Seller shall sell and deliver Option Energy to Purchaser at the Option Energy Delivery Point(s) as and to the extent that it is generated, and Purchaser shall accept and pay for such Option Energy at the Option Energy Delivery Point(s), all in accordance with the terms and conditions of this Agreement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, (i) Purchaser shall not be required to take and pay for Option Energy at an Option Energy Delivery Point to the extent that firm transmission from such Option Energy Delivery Point to Purchaser's System exceeds $4.00 per kW month, (ii) Purchaser shall not be required to accept and pay for Option Energy that is generated by wind turbine generating systems that are not in compliance in all material respects with federal, state and local laws, regulations and ordinances applicable to such systems, and (iii) for a wind generation project located outside of Washington, Oregon, Idaho and western Montana, the transmission losses shall not exceed five percent (5%) (unless Seller agrees to mitigate such losses by appropriate adjustment to quantity or price terms).

 (e) The Purchaser shall pay Seller the price specified in Exhibit D for each MWh of Option Energy delivered to the Option Energy Delivery Point(s). This amount shall be added to amounts due under Article 7, and shall be billed pursuant to Article 9.

 (f) If Seller exercises this option, the Parties shall, if and to the extent necessary, use commercially reasonable efforts to amend this Agreement and any filings with FERC to give effect to the transactions contemplated by this provision.

 4.3. Documentation of Environmental Attributes. Sale of Environmental Attributes under this Agreement shall transfer to Purchaser all right, title, and interest in and to the Environmental Attributes associated with the Energy purchased by Purchaser under Section 4.2 of this Agreement. At Purchaser's request, Seller shall provide reasonable evidence of Purchaser's right, title and interest in such Environmental Attributes and reasonable information with respect to such Environmental Attributes. Seller makes no representation or warranty, expressed or implied, regarding the current or future existence of any Environmental Attributes, but will transfer to Purchaser any and all Environmental Attributes associated with the Energy purchased by Seller under this Agreement.

 4.4. Title and Risk of Loss. Title to and risk of loss of Energy and Environmental Attributes sold to Purchaser under this Agreement shall pass from Seller to Purchaser when the a transmission provider receives the Energy at the Delivery Point, the Additional Energy Delivery Point or the Option Energy Delivery Point(s), as applicable; provided, however, that the quantity of Energy delivered from the Project shall be determined by the Project Developer's Meters pursuant to Article 8 of this Agreement.

 5. Scheduling of Energy.

 5.1. General. The Seller shall schedule, or cause the Project Developer to schedule, Energy to the Delivery Point, the Additional Energy Delivery Point or the Option Energy Delivery Point(s), as applicable, for delivery to Purchaser consistent with Prudent Utility Practices. By giving Seller notice at least ten (10) Business Days in advance, Purchaser may from time to time designate a third party to handle scheduling on behalf of Purchaser. Seller shall submit to Purchaser or Purchaser's designee a schedule of expected hourly deliveries of Energy for the next Day or Days no later than 10 a.m. Pacific Prevailing Time on the immediately preceding Business Day before the Day on which electric power deliveries are to be made, provided, however, that for scheduling of deliveries on weekends and holidays (as defined by the North American Electric Reliability Council), Seller and Purchaser or Purchaser's designee shall follow prevailing scheduling procedures within the WSCC with regard to multiple Day scheduling. The Parties acknowledge that actual deliveries of Energy from the Project or other wind generating facilities depend primarily on the prevailing wind conditions at the Project or such other wind generating facilities and that the schedule from the prior Day or Days is only an estimate of expected deliveries of Energy under this Agreement. Seller shall make commercially reasonable efforts to provide accurate schedules given then available information and forecasting methods. To the extent practicable, Seller shall

 update daily schedules of Energy from the Project and/or other wind generating facilities as forecasts of wind conditions change.

 5.2. Changes in Circumstances. If Purchaser elects to dynamically schedule or if normal industry scheduling practices for electric Energy change in a way that causes a conflict with the provisions of this Article 5, the Parties shall make commercially reasonable efforts to make necessary changes to this Agreement to conform to the prevailing industry scheduling practices or the requirements of dynamic scheduling in effect at that time. Similarly, if a shaping agreement entered into by Purchaser or a similar arrangement affects the scheduling of Energy in a way that causes a conflict with the provisions of this Article 5, the Parties shall make commercially reasonable efforts to make changes in this Agreement to conform to the shaping agreement or similar arrangement.

 5.3. Transmission and Delivery.

 5.3.1. Termination of PacifiCorp Shaping Agreement.

 (a) Purchaser intends to enter into an Integration and Exchange Agreement with PacifiCorp (the "PacifiCorp Shaping Agreement") contemporaneously with this Agreement. Purchaser shall be responsible for its defaults under the PacifiCorp Shaping Agreement and shall otherwise use commercially reasonable efforts to keep the PacifiCorp Shaping Agreement in effect. If it is reasonably likely that the PacifiCorp Shaping Agreement will terminate, Purchaser shall give Seller notice promptly after Purchaser becomes aware of the possibility of termination but in no event less than thirty- five (35) Days before any expected date of termination.

 (b) After the PacifiCorp Shaping Agreement terminates, Purchaser shall continue to take and pay for Energy and Environmental Attributes at the Delivery Point (or such other delivery point(s) as are specified under this Agreement or to which the Parties may otherwise mutually agree) in accordance with this Agreement to the extent that (i) firm or non-firm transmission rights are available under the Open Access System Integration Service (OASIS) or its successor (or that can be otherwise obtained using Prudent Utility Practices) to transmit the Energy delivered at the Delivery Point or other point(s) to Mid-Columbia or another mutually agreed point(s) (regardless of the price of such transmission rights), or (ii) the Parties agree to an Alternative Shaping/Transmission Arrangement (as defined in the PPM Shaping Agreement) (including one in which Purchaser provides such services) and such arrangement enables Purchaser to receive Energy at Mid-Columbia or another mutually agreed point, or (iii) a combination of (i) and (ii) enables Purchaser to receive Energy at Mid-Columbia or another mutually agreed point. To the extent and for as long as the conditions described in (i), (ii) or (iii) above are not satisfied, and to the extent that non-firm transmission is interrupted, Purchaser's duty to take and pay for Energy and Environmental Attributes under this Agreement shall be suspended, except to the extent that the PacifiCorp Shaping Agreement terminates because of a default by Purchaser under that Agreement.

 5.3.2. Seller Transmission Rights.

 (a) After the PacifiCorp Shaping Agreement terminates for reaons other than a Purchaser default, Purchaser may upon at least thirty- five (35) days prior notice to Seller require Seller to assign to Purchaser available Seller Transmission Rights to the extent and for the period that such rights are reasonably needed to transmit Energy from the Delivery Point to Mid-Columbia.

 (b) Seller may at any time assign or release all or part of the Seller Transmission Rights; provided, however, that Seller shall give Purchaser at least one hundred twenty (120) Days prior notice of its intent to assign or release all or part of the Seller Transmission Rights. By notice given within thirty (30) Days after Seller's notice, Purchaser will give notice of its intent to take an assignment of and assume the Seller Transmission Rights that Seller intends to assign or release. If Purchaser does not respond to Seller's notice within such thirty (30) Day period, or if it declines Seller's offer, Seller may assign or release the offered portion of the Seller Transmission Rights. If Purchaser gives notice of its intent to take an assignment of and assume the Seller Transmission Rights that Seller intends to assign or release, Purchaser shall have one hundred twenty (120) Days from the date of Seller's initial notice above in which to complete the assignment and assumption of such Seller Transmission Rights, after which Seller may assign or release the offered portion of the Seller Transmission Rights. The right of first refusal contemplated by this provision shall not apply to arrangements between Seller and third parties that allow Seller to retrieve the affected portion of the Seller Transmission Rights before the date on which they are required by Purchaser under Section 5.3.2(a).

 (c) If Purchaser elects to take an assignment of Seller Transmssion Rights under either Section 5.3.2(a) or (b), then (i) Seller shall assign to Purchaser the Seller Transmission Rights or portion of such rights, and (ii) Purchase shall assume the Seller Transmission Rights assigned to it and all future costs of such rights. Seller has paid a refundable reservation fee to the Transmission Provider to reserve the Seller Transmission Rights. Accordingly, Seller reserves the right to receive from the Transmssion Provider a refund of the reservation fee paid by Seller, plus any interest on that fee due from the Transmission Provider. At Seller's discretion, an assignment of Transmission Rights may take the form of a full assignment of such rights or a back-to-back arrangement in which Seller retains the Seller Transmission Rights but Purchaser enjoys the benefit of those rights. If the Seller Transmission Rights are assigned on a day other than the first day of the month, prepaid costs for any given month shall be prorated on a per diem basis between Seller and Purchaser. In addition, such costs shall be further prorated to the extent that Purchaser assumes only a portion of the Seller Transmission Rights.

 5.3.3. Transmission Services. Purchaser shall enter into one or more agreements with the Transmission Provider and/or with others that provide for the receipt of the Project Energy, Expansion Energy, Additional Energy and/or Option Energy at the Delivery Point, the Additional Energy Delivery Point or the Option Energy Delivery Point(s), as applicable, and for the transmission and delivery of such Energy to points beyond the applicable delivery point. Subject to Sections 5.3.1 and 5.3.2, Purchaser shall be solely responsible for negotiating and maintaining such transmission and delivery agreements during the Term of this Agreement. This Agreement does not include charges for Transmission Services. Purchaser shall arrange for Transmission Services during the Term at its expense and shall be responsible for arranging any OASIS, tagging, transmission scheduling or similar protocols with any transmission providers during the Term.

 5.3.4. Service Modification under PacifiCorp Shaping Agreement.

 (a) If it is reasonably likely that the integration and exchange service provided by Purchaser may be modified under the PacifiCorp Shaping Agreement due to a reduction in the Walla Walla load, Purchaser shall give Seller notice promptly after Purchaser becomes aware of the possibility of such load reduction.

 (b) After notice is received that there is a Walla Walla load decrease under the PacifiCorp Shaping Agreement, Purchaser shall continue to take and pay for Energy and Environmental Attributes at the Delivery Point (or such other delivery point(s) as are specified under this Agreement or to which the Parties may otherwise mutually agree) in accordance with this Agreement to the extent that (i) firm point-to-point transmission rights are available under the Open Access System Integration Service (OASIS) or its successor (or that can be otherwise be obtained using Prudent Utility Practices) from the Walla Walla 230 kV bus to the Wanapum generation bus in an amount equal to the amount by which PacifiCorp's Walla Walla load falls (or is expected to fall) below the Integration Amount as defined in the PPM Shaping Agreement, or (ii) non-firm point-to-point transmission rights are available under the Open Access System Integration Service (OASIS) or its successor (or that can be otherwise be obtained using Prudent Utility Practices) from the Walla Walla 230 kV bus to the Wanapum generation bus in an amount equal to the amount by which PacifiCorp's Walla Walla load falls (or is expected to fall) below the Integration Amount under the PPM Shaping Agreement, or (iii) a combination of (i) and (ii) that enables Purchaser to deliver Energy to PacifiCorp pursuant to the PacifiCorp Shaping Agreement or receive Energy at Mid-Columbia or another mutually agreed point. To the extent and for as long as the conditions described in (i) or (ii) above are not satisfied, and to the extent that non-firm transmission is interrupted, Purchaser's duty to take and pay for, and Seller's duty to sell and deliver, Energy and Environmental Attributes under this Agreement shall be suspended.

 5.3.5. No Obligation to Construct or Expand Transmission. Purchaser shall have no obligation to (a) construct or cause to be constructed any new transmission facilities for the receipt of the Base Energy, Expansion Energy, Additional Energy and/or Option Energy, or (b) expand or cause to be expanded any existing transmission facilities necessary for the receipt of the Base Energy, Expansion Energy, Additional Energy and/or Option Energy.

 5.3.6. Effect of Suspension. If Purchaser suspends this Agreement under Section 5.3.1 and/or Section 5.3.4, (a) the Purchaser shall be released and discharged from any obligations to take and deliver Energy and Environmental Attributes under this Agreement from and during the period of such suspension, but only to the extent of such suspension, (b) the Seller shall be released and discharged from any obligations to sell and deliver Energy and Environmental Attributes under this Agreement arising or accruing under this Agreement from and during the period of such suspension, but only to the extent of such suspension. Seller may re-sell Purchaser's suspended Energy and Environmental Attributes in these circumstances, but if Seller re-sells the suspended Energy and Environmental Attributes at a price greater than the Purchase Price, Purchaser shall be entitled to receive ninety percent (90%) of the amount paid for such Energy and Environmental Attributes in excess of the Purchase Price. This amount shall be due and payable to Purchaser on the 20th Day of the month following the month in which the Seller receives payment for such Energy and Environmental Attributes.

 5.4. Balancing Procedures. The Parties shall balance deliveries of Energy from the Project and the Expansion Project in accordance with the balancing procedures set forth as attached Exhibit F. Exhibit F describes the procedures to ensure that Purchaser receives its share (Exhibit C) of the Energy generated by the Project and the Expansion Project each calendar month. The balancing mechanism is required because Energy from the Project and the Expansion Project will be delivered to two different delivery points, the Delivery Point at Wallulla Substation, where the Transmission Provider will receive Energy for the Purchaser, and BPA's 115 kV line (Exhibit A-4). To the extent that Additional Energy is generated by the Project and the Expansion Project, the balancing procedures in Exhibit F will also apply to the Additional Energy. If after the Effective Date circumstances change in a way that causes a conflict with the provisions of this Section 5.4, the Parties shall make commercially reasonable efforts to make necessary changes to Exhibit F to conform to the circumstances in effect at that time. To the extent Additional Energy or Option Energy is delivered under this Agreement, the Parties shall cooperate in good faith to develop a similar balancing procedure for such Energy, if necessary.

 5.5. Curtailment.

 5.5.1. Purchaser acknowledges that the Project Developer (or the developer of a wind generation project that is supplying Additional Energy or Option Energy under this Agreement) may curtail deliveries of Energy in accordance with Prudent Utility Practices and in a commercially reasonable manner if such project developer reasonably believes that curtailment is necessary: (i) to construct, install, maintain, repair, replace, remove or inspect any of the Turbines or such project's equipment, or (ii) in connection with an emergency condition likely to result in significant damage to Turbines or to the Project's equipment or is deemed necessary by such project developer to protect life or property. If the project developer notifies Seller of any curtailment under clause (i) above, Seller shall promptly notify Purchaser.

 5.5.2. Purchaser acknowledges that the Project Developer (or the developer of a wind generation project that is supplying Additional Energy or Option Energy under this Agreement) shall curtail deliveries of Energy if notified by a transmission provider pursuant to the applicable interconnection agreement that a System Emergency exists, but only for so long as such System Emergency continues and only to the extent required by such transmission provider.

 5.5.3. Seller shall use commercially reasonable efforts under the Project PPA (or under the agreement pursuant to which Seller purchases Energy from a wind generation project that is supplying Additional Energy or Option Energy) to cause the project developer to resume deliveries of Energy as soon after curtailment as is reasonably possible, safe, and in accordance with Prudent Utility Practices.

 5.5.4. During any period in which Seller's receipt of Energy, Expansion Energy, Additional Energy, Option Energy and associated Environmental Attributes from a given wind generation project is curtailed, Purchaser shall bear a pro- rata share of the curtailment in relation to all other purchasers of Seller's share of such Energy, Expansion Energy, Additional Energy, and/or Option Energy and associated Environmental Attributes (including Seller).

 6. Project Operation, Maintenance, and Availability.

 6.1. Operating Standards. Seller shall use reasonable efforts to cause the Project Developer to construct, operate and maintain the Project in accordance with Prudent Utility Practices and consistent with any interconnection agreement related to the Project.

 6.2. Site Visits. Upon Purchaser's reasonable prior request to Seller, Seller shall use reasonable efforts to cause Project Developer to permit representatives of Purchaser to visit the Project and to ascertain the condition of the Project, all at Purchaser's sole risk and expense. (Purchaser shall, where possible, make this request at least thirty (30) Days in advance of the visit.) Purchaser shall defend, indemnify and hold Seller harmless against any claims, demands, or liabilities of any nature whatsoever asserted by any of its representatives on account of any personal injury or property damage suffered by such representative while visiting the Project. Seller shall defend, indemnify and hold Purchaser harmless against any claims, demands, or liabilities of any nature whatsoever asserted by any of its representatives on account of any personal injury or property damage suffered by such representative while visiting the Project. This Section 6.2 is not intended to waive or otherwise affect any claim that either Purchaser or Seller may have against Project Developer arising as a result of any such site visit.

 6.3. Inspections, Maintenance and Repairs. Seller shall use reasonable efforts to cause Project Developer (a) to devise and implement a plan of inspection, maintenance and repair for the Project and its components in order to maintain such equipment in safe and reliable operating conditions and in accordance with Prudent Utility Practices, and (b) to keep records with respect to inspections, maintenance and repairs to the Project. Seller shall use reasonable efforts to cause Project Developer to permit Purchaser to inspect the plan and records during Project Developer's regular business hours upon reasonable notice.

 6.4. Scheduled Maintenance Schedule. Purchaser acknowledges that Project Developer is required to deliver its Scheduled Maintenance schedule for a Contract Year at least sixty (60) Days before the beginning of that Contract Year. Within ten (10) Days after Seller receives the Scheduled Maintenance schedule from Project Developer, Seller shall provide Purchaser with written notice of Scheduled Maintenance Outages for the upcoming Contract Year, including a good faith estimate of the duration and timing of such outages. Seller shall use commercially reasonable efforts, consistent with its obligations to other purchasers and to the Project Developer, to accommodate any outage schedule adjustment that is requested by Purchaser. To the extent that Additional Energy and Option Energy come from wind generating facilities other than the Project or Expansion Project, Seller shall use commercially reasonable efforts to provide Purchaser with the schedule maintenance schedule and scheduled maintenance outages for such wind generating facilities consistent with the provisions above.

 6.5. Mechanical Availability.

 6.5.1. Seller guarantees that (a) as calculated at the beginning of the second Contract Year, the Project and the Expansion Project shall have achieved a Mechanical Availability Percentage of 90.75% for the prior one-year period, and (b) as calculated at the beginning of the third Contract Year and each Contract Year thereafter, the Project, Expansion Project, and any wind generating facilities that provide Additional Energy and Environmental Attributes and/or Option Energy and Environmental Attributes under this Agreement shall have achieved a Mechanical Availability Percentage of 93.75% for the prior one-year period.

 6.5.2. For each percentage point (rounded to the nearest 1/100 of one percent) that the Mechanical Availability Percentage is lower than the guaranteed Mechanical Availability Percentage, Seller shall pay Purchaser liquidated damages equal to the difference between the guaranteed Mechanical Availability Percentage and the actual Mechanical Availability Percentage multiplied by the sum of: (a) Mean Base Energy, (b) Mean Expansion Energy, (c) Mean Additional Energy, (d) Mean Option Energy, multiplied by the applicable Cost to Cover for the Contract Year in which the Project, the Expansion Project and/or any wind generating projects supplying Additional Energy and/or Option Energy failed to achieve the applicable Mechanical Availability Percentage ("Availability LDs"), all as contemplated by this Section 6.5. The Purchase Price for purposes of the Cost to Cover calculation shall be determined on a weighted average basis based on the relative magnitudes of Mean Base Energy, Mean Expansion Energy, Mean Additional Energy and Mean Option Energy for the Contract Year that is the subject to the mechanical availability test.

 6.5.3. Purchaser shall not be entitled to receive Availability LDs under this Section 6.5 to the extent that the Project's failure or the Expansion Project's failure to achieve the guaranteed Mechanical Availability Percentage was caused by (a) the Transmission Provider or any of its agents, contractors, vendors, or employees, (b) the Purchaser or any of its agents, contractors, vendors or employees, or (c) a Force Majeure Event.

 6.5.4. Within thirty (30) Days after the end of a Contract Year in which the applicable Mechanical Availability Percentage set forth in this Section 6.5 is not met, Seller will pay Purchaser the Availability LDs.

 6.5.5. An Example illustrating the calculation of Availability LDs under certain stated assumptions is set forth in Exhibit B.

 6.6. Total Guaranteed Annual Energy.

 6.6.1. Seller guarantees that as calculated at the beginning of the third Contract Year and each Contract Year thereafter, the Total Average Annual Energy for the prior twenty-four-month period shall have been no less than the Total Guaranteed Annual Energy. To produce a single annual number for comparison to the Total Guaranteed Annual Energy, the Total Average Annual Energy for each year in the prior 24 month period shall be added together and divided by two. For each kWh that the Total Average Annual Energy as so determined is less than the Total Guaranteed Annual Energy, Seller shall pay Purchaser liquidated damages in an amount equal to the difference between Total Guaranteed Annual Energy and the Total Average Annual Energy as so determined (stated in MWh) multiplied by the Cost to Cover for the same 24 month period preceding the Contract Year in which the calculation contemplated by this Section 6.6.1 is made, with the Purchase Price for purposes of the Cost to Cover calculation to be determined on a weighted average basis based on the relative magnitudes of the Mean Base Energy, Mean Expansion Energy, Mean Additional Energy and Mean Option Energy ("Energy LDs"); provided, however, that any Availability LDs owing under Section 6.5 above shall be deducted from any Energy LDs owing under this Section 6.6.

 6.6.2. Purchaser shall not be entitled to any Energy LDs to the extent the failure to achieve the guaranteed levels was caused by (a) a transmission provider or any of its agents, contractors, vendors or employees, (b) the Purchaser or any of its agents, contractors, vendors or employees or (c) a Force Majeure Event.

 6.6.3. An Example illustrating the calculation of Energy LDs under certain stated assumptions is set forth in Exhibit B.

 6.7. Exclusiveness and Non-Duplication of Remedies. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, the remedies provided for in this Article 6 shall be Purchaser's exclusive remedy for Seller's breach of this Article 6. In addition, the remedies in Section 6.5 and 6.6 shall be construed so as not to produce duplicative remedies.

 6.8. Liquidated Remedies. The Parties acknowledge that it is extremely impractical and difficult to assess actual damages in the event that Seller fails to perform in the delivery of Energy or Environmental Attributes under this Agreement, and the Parties therefore agree that the payment of liquidated damages as contemplated in this Article 6 constitutes a fair and reasonable calculation of actual damages to Purchaser in the event that Seller fails to perform.

 7. Purchase Price; Credit Support.

 7.1. Purchase Price. The price for Energy and all Environmental Attributes delivered under this Agreement shall be as shown in Exhibit D (the "Purchase Price").

 7.2. Credit Support.

 7.2.1. During the Term, if there is any Material Adverse Change affecting Purchaser or Seller's Affiliate, the other party, in its discretion, may require the party experiencing the Material Adverse Change to provide Credit Support sufficient to assure that the Party experiencing or affected by the Material Adverse Change will continue to meet its current contractual obligations under this Agreement and its contractual obligations for the next twelve (12) Months from the date of the demand for Credit Support (or if the remaining Term of this Agreement is less than twelve (12) Months, for the remaining Term of this Agreement).

 7.2.2. Following a demand for Credit Support and until such time as the Party is no longer experiencing or affectd by a Material Adverse Change, the Party experiencing or affected by the Material Adverse Change shall maintain satisfactory Credit Support on an ongoing, rolling basis sufficient to assure its current contractual obligations and its contractual obligations for the following twelve (12) Months. At the request of either Party, Credit Support shall be increased or decreased as appropriate once per calendar month such that the party providing Credit Support will be able to meet the affected Party's then-current contractual obligations and its contractual obligations under this Agreement for the next twelve (12) month period (or if the remaining Term of this Agreement is less than twelve (12) months, for the remaining Term of this Agreement).

 7.2.3. In the case of a Material Adverse Change being experienced by Seller's Affiliate, such Credit Support will be provided by Seller's Affiliate on behalf of Seller. If the Seller's Affiliate is experiencing a Material Adverse Change, Seller's Credit Support for the above period shall be in an amount sufficient to provide replacement power, the calculation of which shall be the positive difference between the forward power prices at Mid-Columbia (as determined using information from a commercially reasonable independent source) for the above-referenced rolling twelve (12) Month period and the Purchaser Price herein multiplied by the MWh that would be delivered for the above-referenced twelve (12) Month period under this Agreement (assuming deliveries of 125% of the Total Guaranteed Annual Energy applicable to such period).

 7.2.4. If Purchaser is experiencing a Material Adverse Change, Purchaser's Credit Support for the above period shall be in an amount equal to the greater of (a) two month's of anticipated receivables, or (b) the negative difference between the forward power prices at Mid-Columbia (as determined using information from a commercially reasonable independent source) for the above referenced twelve (12) Month period and the Purchase Price herein multiplied by the MWh that would be delivered for the above referenced twelve (12) Month period under this Agreement (assuming deliveries of 125% of the Total Guaranteed Annual Energy applicable to such period).

 7.2.5. If the party experiencing a Material Adverse Change (Seller's Affiliate or Purchaser) fails to provide such Credit Support within ten (10) Days of a request for Credit Support or fails to maintain Credit Support as set forth above, the requesting Party may suspend its performance under this Agreement until such Credit Support is posted or may treat the failure to provide Credit

 Support as a default and exercise its rights under Article 10 of this Agreement.

 7.2.6. At a Party's written request, the other Party shall furnish the requesting Party financial information as may be reasonably required to confirm that the Purchaser or the Seller's Affiliate has not been affected by a Material Adverse Change.

 7.2.7. Either Party may assign its Credit Support obligation to a guarantor that will be able to meet the minimum credit standards set forth in the definition of Material Adverse Change.

 7.3. Taxes. Purchaser shall be responsible for paying when due any sales, excise, business, use, Energy or other taxes applicable to the purchase of Energy and associated Environmental Attributes under this Agreement (other than taxes on the income produced from the sale of such Energy and Environmental Attributes).

 8. Measurement and Metering.

 8.1. Seller's Metering Equipment. Seller shall use commercially reasonable efforts under the Project PPA to cause Project Developer to install, own, operate, and maintain all metering and data processing equipment needed for the registration, recording, and transmission of information regarding the Energy generated from the Turbines included in the Project and the Expansion Project and delivered to the Delivery Point, real and reactive power output, voltage output, current output, and other related parameters that are required for computing the payments due to Seller from Purchaser (the "Project Developer's Meters"). Seller shall use commercially reasonable efforts under the Project PPA to cause Project Developer to install Project Developer's Meters on Purchaser's side of the Delivery Point. Seller shall, if requested by Purchaser and at the sole cost and expense of Purchaser, use commercially reasonable efforts under the Project PPA to cause the Project Developer to make such information available to Purchaser on a real-time basis by remote access.

 8.2. Check Meters. Purchaser may instruct Seller to exercise Seller's rights under the Project PPA to install, maintain, and operate Seller's own metering, telemetry and communication equipment for the purpose of comparison with Project Developer's metering equipment and observation of the Energy generation at the Project and the Expansion Project (collectively, the "Check Meters"). The Check Meters shall be installed at Purchaser's expense. Seller shall bill Purchaser monthly for Seller's costs of installing, maintaining and operating the Check Meters, all in accordance with Article 9; provided, however, that if other purchasers of Energy from the Project and/or the Expansion Project instruct Seller to exercise its right to install, maintain or operate Check Meters, the cost of installing, maintaining and operating the Check Meters shall be borne by the requesting parties on a pro rata basis. Purchaser acknowledges that the Check Meters may not interfere with the installation, maintenance and operation of Project Developer's metering equipment or the Project Developer's Interconnection Facilities. Seller shall use commercially reasonable efforts under the Project PPA to cause Project Developer to arrange for a location within or near Project Developer's Meters, accessible to Seller and Purchaser, for such metering, telemetry and communication equipment to be installed.

 8.3. Measurements. Readings of Project Developer's Meters shall be conclusive as to the amount of Energy delivered under this Agreement, except to the extent of any suspension under this Agreement; provided, however, that if any of Project Developer's Meters is out of service or is determined, pursuant to Section 8.4 hereof, to be registering inaccurately, measurement of Energy delivered under this Agreement shall be determined in the following sequence:

 8.3.1. by Check Meters, if they have been installed and are operational pursuant to Section 8.2; or

 8.3.2. by using the hourly integrated instantaneous MW value used to monitor the composite turbine output from the computer monitoring system (a) to compare to the hourly meter reading of the Project Developer's Meters to determine the beginning of the deviation event and (b) by using the integrated instantaneous MW value from beginning of the deviation event to the time when the meter was back in-service or repaired to estimate Energy delivered; or

 8.3.3. by the computer monitoring system for each Turbine included in the Project and/or Expansion Project, using a mathematical calculation agreed upon by Seller and Project Developer (subject to Purchaser's approval, which Purchaser shall not unreasonably withhold, condition or delay) to adjust the output thereof to account for electrical losses in the gathering system and Turbine transformers and substation transformers up to the Delivery Point; or

 8.3.4. by estimating the unmeasured or inaccurately measured quantities by referring to the measurements made during other comparable time periods having similar conditions when the Project Developer's Meters were registering accurately, subject to Purchaser's approval, which Purchaser shall not unreasonably withhold, condition or delay); or

 8.3.5. if no reliable information exists as to the period over which the Project Developer's Meter was registering inaccurately, it shall be assumed for correction purposes under this Agreement that such inaccuracy was equal to (i) if the period of inaccuracy can be determined, the actual period during which inaccurate measurements were made; or (ii) if the period of inaccuracy cannot be determined, one-half of the period from the date of the last previous test of such meter through the date of the adjustments, provided, however, that, in the case of clause (ii), the period covered by the correction shall not exceed six months.

 8.4. Testing. Seller shall use commercially reasonable efforts under the Project PPA (a) to cause Project Developer to test and verify the accuracy of Project Developer's Meters at least annually, and (b) to enable Purchaser to exercise Seller's rights under the Project PPA to test and verify the accuracy of Project Developer's Meters' measurements and recordings. Seller represents and warrants that the measurement and metering provisions of the Project PPA are as set forth in the attached Exhibit G. Seller shall not amend the measurement and metering provisions of the Project PPA without the Purchaser's prior written consent (which Purchaser shall not unreasonably withhold, condition or delay). Purchaser acknowledges that if Check Meters are installed in accordance with Section 8.2 of this Agreement, Seller will be obligated (at Purchaser's expense) to test and verify such Check Meters at least annually.

 8.5. Resolution of Disagreements Concerning Meter Accuracy. Each meter contemplated by this Agreement shall be accurate to within a two percent (2%) variance. Purchaser acknowledges that disputes regarding the accuracy of any meter will be resolved under the Project PPA as follows: If either Seller or Project Developer disputes a meter's accuracy or condition, it will so advise the owner of the meter in writing. The owner of the meter will, within fifteen (15) Days after receiving the notice, advise the disputing Party in writing as to its position concerning the meter's accuracy and reasons for taking such position. If the parties are unable to resolve their disagreement through reasonable negotiations, then either Party may submit such dispute to an unaffiliated third-party engineering company mutually acceptable to Seller and Project Developer to test the meter. Should the meter register within the permitted two percent (2%) variance, the disputing Party shall bear the cost of inspection; otherwise, the cost shall be borne by the owner of the meter. Any repair or replacement shall be made at the expense of the owner of the meter as soon as practicable, based on the third-party engineer's report. If the Purchaser wishes to dispute a meter's accuracy or condition, it will so advise Seller and Seller shall use commercially reasonable efforts to promptly exercise Seller's rights to dispute the meter's accuracy or condition under the Project PPA. If the meter registers within the permitted two percent (2%) variance, the Purchaser shall bear the cost of inspection; otherwise, the cost shall be borne by Purchaser or Project Developer.

 8.6. Meter Corrections. Following testing, corrections will be made as follows: If any meter contemplated by this Agreement is found to be accurate or to be in error by not more than the permitted two percent (2%) variance, previous recordings of such meter shall be considered accurate in computing deliveries under the Project PPA and this Agreement, and to the extent necessary the meter shall be promptly adjusted to record correctly. If any meter is found to be in error by an amount exceeding the two percent (2%) variance, then such meter shall be promptly adjusted to record correctly and any previous recordings by such meter shall be adjusted in accordance with Section 8.3 of this Agreement. If the difference of the payments actually made by Purchaser minus the adjusted payment is a positive number, Seller shall pay the difference to Purchaser; if the difference is a negative number, Purchaser shall pay the difference to Seller. In either case, the Party paying such difference shall also pay interest at the rate specified in Section 17.7, and such payment (including such interest) shall be made within thirty (30) Days of receipt of a corrected invoice.

 8.7. Interconnection Agreement. In the event (and to the extent) of a conflict between Sections 8.1 and 8.6 and the Interconnection Agreement, the provisions of the Interconnection Agreement shall control.

 8.8. Maintenance and Records. Within thirty Days after the end of each calendar month, Seller shall provide to Purchaser a written monthly report, which shall include information on the Mechanical Availability Percentage, summaries of production of the Turbines, any other significant events related to the operation of the Turbines, and any supporting information that Purchaser may reasonably request. Seller shall use reasonable efforts to cause Project Developer to maintain an electronic log showing operations of the Project and the Expansion Project during each hour of the Term beginning as of the Commercial Operation Date. Such log shall be sent to the Purchaser monthly and shall include all information reasonably required to confirm the Project and the Expansion Project availability.

 8.9. Metering and Measuring of Energy from Other Wind Generation Projects. If Seller is supplying Additional Energy or Option Energy under this Agreement from a wind generation project(s) other than the Project or the Expansion Project, the Parties shall meter and measure such Energy for all purposes under this Agreement in a manner consistent with the agreement(s) pursuant to which Seller purchases such Energy from those wind generation project(s); provided, however, that any such metering and measuring provisions shall be subject to Purchaser's consent, which Purchaser shall not unreasonably withhold, condition or delay.

 9. Billing And Payment.

 9.1. Monthly Billing. Seller shall bill Purchaser no later than the fifteenth (15th) Day of each calendar month for charges determined under Articles 7 and 8 for the preceding calendar month and shall transmit the bill to Purchaser by fax. Seller shall include in each faxed bill sufficient detail to allow Purchaser to verify the billing, together with the information required under Section 5.4. This Agreement shall be specifically excluded from inclusion in the consolidated settlement under the Mutual Netting Agreement between the Parties dated February 8, 1999.

 9.2. Payments to Seller. Purchaser shall pay the amount specified in the bill by electronic wire transfer of immediately available funds by the later of ten (10) Days after Purchaser's receipt of the bill or the 20th Day of the month in accordance with written wire transfer instructions given by Seller to Purchaser from time to time; provided, however, that any changes to such wire transfer instructions shall not be effective until five (5) Business Days after the date on which notice of the change is sent to Purchaser. If the due date is not a Business Day, Purchaser shall pay the monthly bill on the Business Day following such due date. In the event of a dispute, the entire bill shall be paid when due, but such payment shall not waive either Party's right to dispute the bill under Article 10.

 9.3. Interest on Unpaid Amounts. If a Party fails to pay the full amount due on or before the close of business on the due date, the owing Party shall pay interest on the unpaid amount for each Day it is late at the rate specified in Section 17.7.

 10. Audit Rights and Disputes.

 10.1 Audit Rights; Maintenance of Records.

 (a) Each Party shall have the right, upon reasonable notice to the other Party and during the other Party's regular business hours, to access all of the other Party's metering records, accounting records and supporting documents of any billing or delivery of Energy associated with this Agreement. Each Party shall keep complete and accurate records, and shall maintain such data as may be necessary for the purpose of ascertaining the accuracy of all relevant data, estimates, or statements of charges or a given invoice until the later of (i) two (2) years from the date of that invoice, or (ii) if there is a dispute relating to that invoice, the date on which the dispute is resolved. Each Party shall bear the costs of its own audit; provided, however, that the other Party agrees to cooperate with the audit and shall not charge the other Party for any reasonable costs (including without limitation the cost of photocopies) that the auditing Party may incur as a result of such audit. Should the audit discover an over-billing error or errors, the Seller shall compensate the Purchaser the amount of the error plus interest at the rate specified in Section 17.7. Such interest shall accrue from the date on which the Purchaser paid the overbilled amount to the Seller. Should the audit discover an under-billing error or errors, the Purchaser shall compensate the Seller the amount of the error plus interest at the rate specified in Section 17.7. Such interest will accrue from the date on which the Purchaser should have paid the underbilled amount to the Seller.

 (b) To the extent that any such rights are available or become available under the Project PPA, Seller shall at Purchaser's request use commercially reasonable efforts under the Project PPA to obtain access to Project Developer's metering records, accounting records and supporting documents of any billing or delivery of Energy associated the purchase and sale of Energy and Environmental Attributes under this Agreement to address matters of concern to Purchaser under this Agreement; provided, however, that neither Seller nor the Project Developer will be required to disclose pricing information or other information that is confidential under the Project PPA.

 10.2 Resolution of Alleged Billing Errors. Within eighty (80) Days after receipt of any invoice, Purchaser may provide written notice to Seller of any alleged error therein. If Seller notifies Purchaser in writing within thirty (30) Days of receipt of such notice that Seller disagrees with the allegation of error, the Parties shall meet, by telephone conference call or otherwise, within five (5) Business Days of Seller's response for the purpose of attempting to resolve the dispute. If the Parties are unable to

 resolve the dispute within thirty (30) Days after their initial meeting, either Party may proceed to seek whatever remedy may be available to that Party at law or in equity (except as limited by Articles 6 or 13). If the Seller is found to be in error, Seller will refund to Purchaser the amount that Purchaser paid in excess of the amount that Purchaser actually owed pursuant to Section 9.1 above, plus interest on such excess payment at the rate specified in Section 17.7. Such interest will accrue from the later of (a) the date on which the Purchaser paid the disputed amount to the Seller, or (b) the date on which the Purchaser gives the Seller notice of the dispute, until the date on which the Purchaser receives payment in full of the amount owed to it.

 10.3 Corrected Invoices. If Seller identifies an error in an invoice, it shall promptly give the Purchaser a reasonably detailed notice describing the nature and effect of the error. If the Purchaser notifies the Seller in writing within thirty (30) Days of receipt of such notice that Purchaser disagrees with the allegation of an error, the Parties shall meet, by telephone conference call or otherwise, within five (5) Business Days of the Purchaser's response for the purpose of attempting to resolve the dispute. If the Parties are unable to resolve the dispute within thirty (30) Days after their initial meeting, either Party may proceed to seek whatever remedy may be available to that Party at law or in equity. If the error requires the Seller to reimburse the Purchaser for amounts previously paid by the Purchaser, Seller shall promptly reimburse the Purchaser for such amounts or credit Purchaser for such amounts in the next invoice to Purchaser plus interest on such amount at the rate specified in Section 17.7. Such interest will accrue from the date on which Purchaser paid the disputed amount to Seller. If the error requires Purchaser to pay Seller additional amounts, Seller shall add the amount owed to a subsequent invoice plus interest on such amount at the rate specified in Section 17.7. Such interest will accrue from the later of (a) the date on which Purchaser payment was due, or (b) the date on which Seller gives Purchaser notice of the dispute.

 10.4 Time Limits on Disputes and Corrections. Until the second anniversary of the date on which Purchaser receives an invoice, (a) Purchaser may dispute the invoice under Section 10.2, and (b) Seller may give Purchaser a notice correcting the invoice under Section 10.3. An invoice that has not been disputed under Section 10.2 or noticed for correction under Section 10.3 before such second anniversary shall be conclusive, final and no longer subject to adjustment.

 11. Notices. Except as specifically provided below, any notice or notification required, permitted or contemplated hereunder shall be in writing, shall be addressed to the Party to be notified at the address set forth below or at such other address as a Party may designate for itself from time to time by notice hereunder, and shall be deemed to have been validly served, given or delivered (i) five Business Days following deposit in the United States mail, with proper first class postage prepaid, (ii) the next Business Day after such notice was delivered to a regularly scheduled overnight delivery carrier with delivery fees either prepaid or an arrangement, satisfactory with such carrier, made for the payment of such fees, or (iii) upon receipt of notice given by fax or personal delivery:

 12.1.8. Failure of Seller to post or maintain Credit Support pursuant to Section 7.2.

 12.2. Notice of Default. The Party in default under this Agreement shall be referred to as the "Defaulting Party," and the other Party shall be referred to as the "Non-Defaulting Party." The Non- Defaulting Party shall have the right to give the Defaulting Party a written Notice of Default, which shall describe the default in reasonable detail and state the date by which the default must be cured.

 12.3. Opportunity to Cure. In the case of a default described in Sections 12.1.2, 12.1.3, 12.1.4, 12.1.5, 12.1.6, there will be no cure period and no opportunity to cure outside of any time period expressly stated in such section. In the case of a failure to pay money when due under Section 12.1.1, the default must be cured within ten (10) Days after the Defaulting Party's receipt of the Notice of Default by payment of the amount due plus interest as provided in Section 17.7 from the date due until paid. In the case of all other defaults under Section 12.1.1, the default must be cured within thirty (30) Days after the Defaulting Party's receipt of the Notice of Default, except as provided in the next sentence. If the Defaulting Party cures the default within the applicable cure period, or if the failure is one (other than the failure to make payments or post Credit Support) that cannot in good faith be corrected within the thirty (30) Day cure period and the Defaulting Party begins to correct the default within the cure period and thereafter continues corrective efforts with reasonable diligence until a cure is effected, the Notice of Default shall be inoperative, and the Defaulting Party shall lose no rights under this Agreement; provided, however, that the default must be cured no later than one hundred eighty (180) days after the Defaulting Party's receipt of the Notice of Default. If, within the specified period, the Defaulting Party does not cure the default or begin to cure the default as provided above, the Non-Defaulting Party may exercise the remedies set forth in Section 12.4.

 12.4. Rights upon Default. After providing notice and an opportunity to cure as provided above, the Non-Defaulting Party shall have the right (but not the duty) to terminate this Agreement by giving written notice to the Defaulting Party.

 12.5. Remedies Not Exclusive. Except as limited by Section 2.3.3 and Articles 6 and 13, each and every power and remedy given to the Non-Defaulting Party shall be in addition to every other power and remedy now or hereafter available to the Non-Defaulting Party at law or in equity (including the right to specific performance). No delay or omission in the exercise of any power or remedy and no renewal or extension of any performance due under this Agreement shall impair any such power or remedy or waive any default. Notwithstanding any termination of this Agreement, all financial obligations that have accrued under this Agreement (including obligations for cover or replacement cost remedies through the end of the Term) shall remain until paid.

 12.6. Net Out of Payables Upon Termination. Without limiting its remedies under this Agreement, upon termination of this Agreement for default, the Non-Defaulting Party may elect to aggregate all payments due and amounts otherwise owing under this Agreement into a single amount by netting out (a) all payments and other amounts that are due to the Defaulting Party under this Agreement, plus, at the option of the Non-Defaulting Party, any cash or other form of security then available to the Non-Defaulting Party pursuant to Article 7, against (b) all payments and other amounts that are due to the Non-Defaulting Party under this Agreement, so that all such amounts shall be netted out to a single liquidated amount (the "Termination Payment") payable by one Party to the other within thirty (30) Days of the date on which the Non-Defaulting Party notifies the Defaulting Party of the amount of the Termination Payment. The Termination Payment shall be payable to or from the Non-Defaulting Party, as appropriate. Notwithstanding Article 13, Seller shall be entitled to recover, upon termination of this Agreement for Power Purchaser's default, all incidental and other costs reasonably incurred by Seller in closing out forward positions and similar transactions entered into in connection with this Agreement, including but not limited to liquidated damages incurred by Seller in closing out mark-to-market arrangements.

 12.7. Closeout Setoffs. After calculation of the Termination Payment in accordance with Section 12.6, if the Defaulting Party would be owed the Termination Payment, the Non-Defaulting Party shall be entitled, at its option and in its discretion, to set off against such Termination Payment any amounts due and owing by the Defaulting Party to the Non-Defaulting Party under any other agreements, instruments or undertakings between the Defaulting Party and the Non-Defaulting Party.

 13. Limitation of Liability. NEITHER PARTY SHALL BE LIABLE FOR SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, EXEMPLARY, INDIRECT OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, WHETHER BASED ON CONTRACT OR TORT (INCLUDING SUCH PARTY'S OWN NEGLIGENCE) AND INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, LOSS OF PROFITS OR REVENUE, LOSS OF USE OF THE EQUIPMENT OR ANY ASSOCIATED EQUIPMENT, COST OF CAPITAL, COST OF PURCHASED POWER, COST OF SUBSTITUTE EQUIPMENT, FACILITIES OR SERVICES, DOWNTIME COSTS, OR CLAIMS OF CUSTOMERS OF SELLER OR OF PURCHASER FOR SUCH DAMAGES.

 14. Dispute Resolution.

 14.1. Representatives. Not later than thirty (30) Days after the Effective Date of this Agreement, each Party shall appoint a representative to coordinate with the other Party the implementation of this Agreement (each a "Representative" and collectively the "Representatives"). Either Party may change their Representative by providing thirty (30) Days notice to the other Party. If any dispute arises with respect to either Party's performance under this Agreement, the Representatives shall meet to attempt to resolve such dispute, either in person or by telephone, within ten (10) Business Days after the written request of either Representative. If the Representatives are unable to resolve such dispute, a senior officer of Purchaser and a senior officer of Seller shall meet, either in person or by telephone, within ten (10) Business Days after either Representative provides written notice that the Representatives have been unable to resolve such dispute.

 14.2 Jurisdiction and Venue. Any disputes arising out of, in connection with or with respect to this Agreement, the subject matter of this Agreement, the performance or non-performance of any obligation under this Agreement, that cannot be resolved in accordance with subsection 14.1, shall be adjudicated in Thurston County Superior Court, Thurston County, Washington and nowhere else. Each of the Parties irrevocably consents to the jurisdiction of such Court. Provided, however, the Parties may mutually consent to binding arbitration in the alternative.

 15. Assignment.

 15.1. Restriction on Assignment by Seller. Except as expressly provided in this Section 15.1, Seller may not Transfer this Agreement without Purchaser's prior written consent, not to be unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned; provided, however, that Purchaser's consent is not required for any Transfer of this Agreement to an Affiliate of Seller. In addition, Seller may from time to time grant one or more security interests in its interest in this Agreement without Purchaser's consent.

 15.2. Restriction on Assignment by Purchaser. Purchaser may not Transfer this Agreement without Seller's prior written consent, not to be unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned. Seller may withhold its consent if Purchaser proposes to Transfer this Agreement to any party that has a credit rating from a Standard & Poor's Rating Group of BBB or less. If Purchaser wishes to Transfer this Agreement, it shall provide Seller with a detailed description of the nature and duration of the proposed Transfer and information concerning the proposed transferee.

 15.3. Assumption of and Release from Liabilities. Any permitted assignee or transferee of a Party's interest in this Agreement shall assume, as a condition to the effectiveness of the Transfer, all existing and future obligations of that Party to be performed under this Agreement.

 15.4. Binding Effect. This Agreement shall bind and inure to the benefit of the Parties and their permitted successors and assigns.

 15.5. No Waiver. A Party's consent to a Transfer shall not be construed or deemed to be a waiver of the restrictions contained in this Article 15 or to be a consent to any later Transfer.

 Exhibit A-1 PROJECT CONFIGURATION

 PROJECT DESCRIPTION

 The Project will be located on private agricultural land located in Umatilla County, Oregon and Walla Walla County, Washington, as more fully set forth in Exhibit A-2, on which Project Developer will obtain wind energy leases or other possessory real estate rights with the landowners. The real estate rights will allow Project Developer to construct and operate wind generation facilities for a defined term; and in exchange, each landowner will receive financial compensation.

 The wind generation facilities include the Turbines more fully described in Exhibits A-2 and A-3 and the electrical system. The Project's electrical system will consist of two key elements: (1) a collector system, which will collect Energy at 690 volts from each wind turbine increased to 34.5 kV by a pad-mounted transformer and connect it to the Project substation; and (2) the substation, which will transform Energy from 34.5 kV to 230kV (and 115 kV if interconnected to the BPA Transmission System).

 The collector system consists of the padmount transformers and the 34.5 kV electric cables. Each Turbine will generate power at 690 volts. A transformer adjacent to each tower will transform the power to 34.5 kV. Transformers will be located on a transformer pad located approximately 5 feet from the tower pad. From there, power will be transmitted via a combination of underground and overhead 34.5 kV electric cables.

 The substation site will occupy approximately 1 to 2 acres in an area just east of Hatch Grade Road in Washington. The substation site will be a graveled, fenced area with transformer and switching equipment and an area to park utility vehicles. Transformers will be non-polychlorinated biphenyl (PCB) oil-filled types.

 Exhibit A-2

 PROJECT MAP

 Exhibit A-3

 DESCRIPTION OF PROJECT TURBINES

 The Project consists of approximately 187 Vestas V-47-660-kW wind turbines located in Walla Walla County, Washington, as more fully set forth in Exhibit A-2. Wind turbines consist of two main components; the turbine tower and the nacelle. The nacelle is the portion of the wind turbine mounted at the top of the tower, which houses the wind turbine itself, the rotor and blades, hub, and gearbox.

 Nacelle: The V-47-660-kW wind turbines operate at wind speeds from 4 to 25 meters per second (m/s) at a relatively constant ( + 10 percent) speed. The turbines operate on a variable pitch principal in which the rotor blades rotate to keep them at the optimum angle to maximize output for all wind speeds. At speeds exceeding 25 m/s, the blades feather (rotate slightly on their axis) and the rotor stops turning. The turbines are equipped with a wind vane that signals wind direction changes to the electronic controller. Within the electronic controller, there is a yaw mechanism, which uses electrical motors to turn the nacelle and rotor so that the turbine faces into the wind.

 Towers: Turbines will be approximately 165 feet tall at the turbine hub, and with the nacelle and blades mounted, the total height of the wind turbine will be approximately 242 feet tall including the turbine blades. The towers will be smooth, hollow steel structures, approximately 14 feet in diameter at the base and weighing approximately 48 tons each. A controller cabinet will be located at the base inside each tower. Cables and a ladder will ascend to the nacelle to provide access for turbine maintenance. A locked door will provide access to the base of the tower. Tower foundations will be spread footing or pier-type footings.

 Exhibit A-5

 DESCRIPTION OF EXPANSION PROJECT TURBINES

 The Expansion Project Turbines will consist of approximately 127 Vestas V-47-660-kW wind turbines located in Umatilla County, Oregon and approximately 85 Vestas V-47-660-kW wind turbines located in Walla Walla County, Washington. The Turbines otherwise have the characteristics described in Exhibit A-3. The Expansion Project is shown on the map attached as Exhibit A-2.

 Exhibit B

 EXAMPLES

 1. Purchaser Termination (Section 2.3.2):

 This section gives Purchaser the right to terminate this Agreement with prior notice if the sum of the Purchaser's share of the Project, the Expansion Energy, the Additional Energy and the Option Energy fails to meet a minimum annual Capacity Factor of 20% for three separate, non-overlapping periods of 12 consecutive months each. An example of the conditions required for termination under this provision follows.

 Assume that:

 (a) Seller is delivering Base Energy to the Purchaser from the Project and the Project's Installed Capacity is 123.42 MW,

 (b) the Project Expansion has an Installed Capacity of 75 MW,

 (c) Expansion Energy is associated with 25 MW of installed capacity in the Project Expansion,

 (d) the Additional Energy is associated with 50 MW of installed capacity in the Project Expansion,

 (e) the installed capacity of the wind energy project used to provide Option Energy is 25 MW, and

 (f) the total Energy of the projects combined is as follows for the following periods:

 * 08/01/04 - 7/31/05: 293,735 MWh

 * 08/01/07 - 7/31/08: 275,790 MWh

 * 02/01/10 - 1/30/11: 297,712 MWh

 The Capacity Factor for the 04/01/04-03/31/05 period is calculated as follows:

 293,735 / ((123.42 x 0.6077+25+50+25) x 8760) = 0.1916 = 19.16%

 (Project Energy + Expansion Energy + Additional Energy + Option Energy)

 The similarly calculated Capacity Factor for each twelve-month period is as follows:

 * 08/01/04 - 7/31/05: 19.16%

 * 08/01/07 - 7/31/08: 17.99%

 * 02/01/10 - 1/30/11: 19.42%

 As a result, the Purchaser would have right to terminate Agreement in accordance with Section 2.3.2.

 2. Mean Project Energy (Definitions):

 If the Project and/or the Expansion Project are reduced in size or reconfigured, the following example shows the effect of such reconfiguration on Mean Project Energy and Mean Expansion Energy.

 Mean Project Energy: If at Project Completion the Project has an Installed Capacity of 123.42 MW, and an Expected Capacity Factor of 33%, the reconfigured Mean Project Energy would be calculated as 123.42 MW x 8,760 hours x 33% = 356,783 MWh.

 Mean Expansion Energy: If at Expansion Project Completion the Expansion Project has an Installed Capacity of 25 MW and an Expected Capacity Factor of 34%, the reconfigured Mean Expansion Energy would be calculated as 25 MW x 8,760 hours x 34% = 74,460 MWh.

 3. Calculation of Base Energy (Section 4.2.1):

 If the Energy generated by the Project from 01/01/02 - 12/31/02 is 348,500 MWh, with 209,000 MWh produced through 07/31/02, and 139,500 MWh produced over the period 08/01/02 through 12/31/02, then the Base Energy for the year 2002 would be calculated as 197,724 MWh, as shown below:

 (a) 01/01/02 - 07/31/02: 209,000 x 40.52% (from Exhibit C) = 84,687 MWh

 (b) 08/1/02 - 12/31/02: 139,500 x 81.03% (from Exhibit C) = 113,037 MWh,

 (c) Total Base Energy for 2002 = 84,687 + 113,037 = 197,724 MWh.

 4. Calculation of Base Energy (Section 4.2.1), Expansion Energy (Section 4.2.2 and Additional Energy (Section 4.2.3):

 Assuming that

 (a) the Expansion Project has an installed capacity of 140 MW,

 (b) the Additional Energy comes from the Expansion Project,

 (c) the Energy generated by the Project from 01/01/04 - 12/31/04 is 370,000 MWh,

 (d) the total energy from the Expansion Project between 01/01/04 and 12/31/04 is 417,000 MWh, with 215,000 MWh generated in the period 1/1/04 through 6/30/04 and 202,000 MWh generated over the period 07/01/04 through 12/31/04

 Then:

 * Base Energy for 2004: 370,000 x 60.77% (from Exhibit C) = 224,849 MWh

 * Expansion Energy for 2004: 417,000 x (25/140) = 74,464 MWh

 * Additional Energy:

 1/1/04 through 6/30/04, (25/140) x 215,000 = 38,393MWh

 7/1/04 through 12/31/04, (50/140) x 202,000 = 72,143 MWh

 * sum of Base, Expansion and Additional Energy = 224,849 + 74,464 + 38,393 + 72,143 = 409,849MWh

 5. Calculation of Mechanical Availability and Availability LDs (Section 6.5):

 (a) Mechanical Availability Percentage

 If during calendar year 2005 the Project consisted of three Turbines A, B and C, which had the following operating characteristics:

 Turbine A* Turbine B** Turbine C***

 Non-Generating Winds 300 194 120 Force Majeure 60 60 30

 Turbine mode = "emergency" 50 25 70

 Turbine mode = "stop" 100 50 75 Turbine mode = "service" 100 150 25 Turbine mode = "pause" 100 75 200 Turbine mode = "run" and faulted 300 105 400 Operational Hours 7750 8101 7840

 Base Hours 8400 8506 8610

 Mechanical Availability 92.26% 95.24% 91.06% Percentage by (Turbine)

 * Base Hours calculated at 8760, less 60 (Force Majeure Event), less 300 (Non-Generating Wind Conditions). Operational Hours calculated at 8760 less 650 (sum of turbine mode = emergency, stop, service, pause and run but faulted), and less 360 (Force Majeure and Non-Generating Wind Conditions).

 ** Base Hours calculated at 8760, less 60 (Force Majeure Event), less 194 (Non-Generating Wind Conditions). Operational Hours calculated at 8760 less 405 (sum of turbine mode = emergency, stop, service, pause and run but faulted), and less 254 (Force Majeure and Non-Generating Wind Conditions).

 *** Base Hours calculated at 8760, less 30 (Force Majeure Event), less 120 (Non-Generating Wind Conditions). Operational Hours calculated at 8760 less 770 (sum of turbine mode = emergency, stop, service, pause and run but faulted), and less 150 (Force Majeure and Non-Generating Wind Conditions).

 Thus, the Mechanical Availability Percentage for the Project would be:

 7750 + 8101 + 7840 = 92.85%

 8400 + 8506 + 8610

 (b) Availability LDs (Section 6.5.2)

 If, as in example 5.a), Seller achieved a Mechanical Availability Percentage of 92.85% for the Project and any other project(s) supplying Expansion Energy, Additional Energy and/or Option Energy during 2005, Availability LDs would be due Purchaser.

 If:

 (i) the Dow Jones Mid-Columbia Electricity Index (weighted average) of firm prices for 2005 is $38.00/MWh,

 (ii) the Purchase Price for the Base Energy and Expansion Energy is $36.50/MWh,

 (iii) the purchase price for the Additional Energy and for the Option Energy is $39.90/MWh,

 (iv) the Purchaser's percentage of the Project for 2005 is 60.77%,

 (v) the Expansion Energy, Additional Energy and the Option Energy have been contracted for, and

 (vi) the Mean Project Energy is 364,747, the Mean Expansion Energy is 73,883 MWh, the Mean Additional Energy is 147,766 MWh and the Mean Option Energy is 73,883,

 Then:

 Availability LDs would be calculated as follows:

 Guaranteed Mechanical Availability Percentage minus Mechanical Availability Percentage: 93.75% - 92.85% = 0.90%

 Mean Base Energy: 364,747 x 0.6077 = 221,657 MWh

 Sum of Mean Base Energy, Mean Expansion Energy, Mean Additional Energy and Mean Option Energy: 221,657 + 73,883 + 147,766 + 73,883 = 517,189 MWh

 Weighted average of contract prices:

 $36.50 x (221,657/517,189) + $36.50 x (73,883/517,189) + $39.90 x (147,766/517,189) + $39.90 x (73,883/517,189) = $37.96

 Cost to Cover: $38.00 - $37.96 = $0.04/MWh

 Availability LDs: (93.75% - 92.85%) x (0.04) x 517,189 = $ 186.19

 6. Calculation of Energy LDs (Section 6.6.1)

 Assuming that:

 (a) Both Additional Energy and Option Energy have been contracted for

 (b) Total energy delivered to Purchaser under this Agreement was 368,000 MWh in 2005 and 324,000 MWh in 2006

 (c) Mean Project Energy equals 364,747 MWh and the Purchaser's percentage of the Project is 60.77%,

 (d) Mean Expansion Energy is 73,883 MWh,

 (e) Mean Additional Energy equals 147,766 MWh,

 (f) Mean Option Energy equals 73,883 MWh,

 (g) The Purchase Price for the Base Energy and the Expansion Energy in 2006 is $36.50/MWh,

 (h) The Purchase Price for the Additional Energy and for the Option Energy in

 2006 is $39.90/MWh,

 (i) Availability LDs for 2005 is $200, and

 (j) The weighted average of the Dow Jones Mid-Columbia Electricity Index price for the 24-month period 2005 -2006 (from January 1, 2005 through December 31, 2006) is calculated to be $40.25/MWh, as follows:

 * Mid Columbia average price for on-peak hours $42.50/MWh

 * Mid Columbia average price for off-peak hours $37.39/MWh

 * Number of hours on-peak over the two years 2005 - 2006: 9,812

 * Number of hours off-peak over the two years 2005 - 2006: 7,708

 * Weighted average of market prices: (9,812/17,520) x 42.50 + (7,708/17,520) x 37.39 = $40.25

 Then:

 Given that: i)Total Guaranteed Annual Energy is the sum of Guaranteed Annual Base Energy, Guaranteed Annual Expansion Energy, Guaranteed Annual Additional Energy and Guaranteed Annual Option Energy; ii) each of these is equal to 73% of, respectively, Mean Base Energy, Mean Expansion Energy, Mean Additional Energy and Mean Option Energy, and iii) the Total Average Energy received by Purchaser over 2005-2006 is less than the Total Guaranteed Annual Energy, Energy LDs would be due Purchaser.

 Total Guaranteed Annual Energy: 0.73 x (364,747 x 0.6077 + 73,883 + 147,766 + 73,883) = 0.73 x 517,189 = 377,548 MWh

 Total Average Energy: 368,000 + 324,000 = 346,000 MWh

 Total Guaranteed Annual Energy minus Total Average Energy: 377,548 - 346,000 = 31,548 MWh

 Weighted average of contract prices: $36.50 x (364,747 x 0.6077/517,189) + $36.50 x (73,883/517,189) + $39.90 x (147,766/517,189 + $39.90 x (73,883/517,189 = $37.96

 Cost to Cover: $40.25 - $37.96 = $2.29

 Energy LDs: 2.29 x 31,548 = $72,244.92

 minus

 Availability LDs as assumed in Paragraph 6.i): $200.00

 equals:

 Energy LDs: $72,044.92

 4. Purchaser's Capacity Share. The Purchaser's share of the Total Project's Installed Capacity inclusive of the amount it shapes for the Seller (the "Purchaser's Capacity Share") shall be an amount stated in MW that is equal to the product of (a) the sum of (i) the Purchaser's percentage share of the Total Project (as defined in Exhibit C, equal to the sum of Purchaser's share in the Project and Purchaser's share in the Expansion Project, in relation to the total Installed Capacity of the Total Project), and (ii) the percentage share of the Total Project that the Purchaser will shape for the Seller pursuant to the PPM Shaping Agreement, multiplied by (b) the total MW of the Total Project's Installed Capacity. For example, if the Purchaser percentage share plus the percentage share that is being shaped for Seller is equal to 57% of the Total Project's Installed Capacity and the Total Project's Installed Capacity is 263 MW, then the Purchaser's Capacity Share is 57% of  263 MW, or 150 MW.

 5. Purchaser's Uncorrected Share. The Purchaser's Capacity Share as calculated above shall be divided by the Total Project's Installed Capacity that is interconnected to the PacifiCorp Control Area and multiplied by 100% to state a percentage called the "Purchaser's Uncorrected Share." For example, if 179 MW of a total of 263 MW of Installed Capacity is interconnected to the PacifiCorp Control Area, then the Purchaser's Uncorrected Share will be 150/179 or 83.80%.

 6. Allocation of Uncorrected Share to Purchaser's Balancing Account. In each calendar month and for each of the categories listed in Paragraph 3(a) and 3(b) above, the following (the "Uncorrected Allocation") shall be allocated to Purchaser's balancing account: Energy equal to the product of (a) the Purchaser's Uncorrected Share multiplied by (b) the total number of MWh attributable to each such category delivered to the PacifiCorp Control Area in that calendar month, as measured at the PacifiCorp Metering Point. For example, if the Purchaser's Uncorrected Share is 83.80% and the total Energy measured at the PacifiCorp Metering Point during On Peak Hours for January 2003 is 20,000 MWh and the total MWh measured at the PacifiCorp Metering Point during Off Peak Hours for January 2002 is 30,000 MWh, then (20,000 MWh x 83.80% = 16,760 MWh) will be allocated to Purchaser's balancing account for On Peak Hours and (30,000 MWh x 83.80% = 24,140 MWh) will be allocated to Purchaser's balancing account for Off Peak Hours.

 7. Actual Allocations.

 7.1 Purchaser's Actual Allocation. The "Purchaser's Actual Allocation" shall be an amount stated in MWh for each of the categories listed in Paragraphs 3(e) and 3(f) above that is equal to the product of (i) the Purchaser's percentage share of the Total Project's Installed Capacity, as set forth in Exhibit C, multiplied by (ii) the Total Metered Output for each of the categories in Paragraphs 3(e) and 3(f) above.

 7.2 Shaped Actual Allocation. The "Shaped Actual Allocation" shall be an amount stated in MWh for each of the categories listed in Paragraph 3(e) and 3(f) equal to the product of (i) the percentage share that the Purchaser will shape for the Seller under the PPM Shaping Agreement, multiplied by (ii) the Total Metered Output for each of the categories in Paragraphs 3(e) and 3(f).

 7.3 Total Actual Allocation. The "Total Actual Allocation" is an amount stated in MWh for each of the categories listed in Paragraphs 3(e) and 3(f) of this Exhibit that is equal to the sum of (i) the Purchaser's Actual Allocation, plus (ii) the Shaped Actual Allocation.

 8. Correction.

 8.1 On Peak Hours. If the Uncorrected Allocation for On Peak Hours in a given calendar month is greater than the Total Actual Allocation for On Peak Hours in that calendar month, the Purchaser shall return the excess MWh to the Seller as part of the shaped Energy that Purchaser delivers during On Peak Hours under the PPM Shaping Agreement in the "Return Month" (as defined in the PPM Shaping Agreement), as provided in Paragraph 9 of this Exhibit. If the Uncorrected Allocation is less than the Total Actual Allocation for On Peak Hours in a given calendar month, the Purchaser shall reduce its delivery of shaped Energy to the Seller under the PPM Shaping Agreement in the Return Month to the extent of the shortfall in MWh as provided in Paragraph 9 of this Exhibit.

 8.2 Off Peak Hours. The Parties shall apply the procedure set forth in Paragraph 8.1 of this Exhibit to Off Peak Hours.

 8.3 Correction. The difference between the Uncorrected Allocation and the Total Actual Allocation is a "Correction." There will be a Correction for On Peak Hours and a Correction for Off Peak Hours.

 9. Spreading of Correction Across On Peak Hours and Off Peak Hours. The Correction shall be spread evenly across On Peak Hours and Off Peak Hours, as applicable, in the Return Month. To do this, the Correction for On Peak Hours shall be divided by the number of On Peak Hours in the Return Month and the Correction for Off Peak Hours shall be divided by the total number of Off Peak Hours in the Return Month. The Corrections shall be rounded to the nearest MW. Any MWh remaining at the end of the Return Month shall be be transferred as a credit or a debit, as appropriate, to the Shaped Actual Allocation in the calendar month immediately following the Return Month, at which time the Total Actual Allocation shall be adjusted to reflect the Correction remaining from the Return Month, separately for On Peak Hours and Off Peak Hours.

 10. Remaining Correction. If the MWh of Correction remaining at the end of a Return Month cannot be eliminated in the first month following the Return Month, the Parties shall meet promptly to negotiate in good faith a commercially reasonable resolution.

 11. Correction Procedures if the Uncorrected Allocation is Lower than the Purchaser's Actual Allocation.

 11.1 Deficit. If the Uncorrected Allocation is lower than the Purchaser's Actual Allocation, the MWh of deficit shall be transferred to the first month following the Return Month and be subtracted from the Shaped Actual Allocation following the procedure described in paragraph 8 above.

 11.2. Unresolved Deficit. If the deficit identified in paragraph 11.1 above cannot be eliminated in the first month after the Return Month the Parties shall meet promptly to negotiate in good faith a commercially reasonable resolution.

 12. Additional Energy. If Additional Energy is generated from the Project, the Purchaser's Capacity Share, the Purchaser's Uncorrected Share, the Purchaser's Uncorrected Allocation, and the Purchaser's Actual Allocation, shall be adjusted to include such Additional Energy following the procedures in Paragraphs 4 through 11 above.

 13. Example.

 Total Project Installed Capacity = 263 MW

 Installed capacity interconnected to the PacifiCorp Control Area = 179 MW

 Installed capacity interconnected to the BPA Control Area = 84 MW

 Total Metered Output and Tracking Metered Output (Paragraphs 2 and 3)

 Total Metered Output for January 2003 30,000 MWh On Peak

 40,000 MWh Off Peak

 Metered Energy at PacifiCorp Control Area: 20,000 MWh On Peak

 30,000 MWh Off Peak

 Metered Energy at BPA Control Area: 10,000 MWh On Peak

 10,000 MWh Off Peak

 Purchaser's Uncorrected Share (Paragraph 5)

 Purchaser's Percentage Share of the Total Project: 100 MW/263 MW = 38.02%

 Purchaser receives power from the PacifiCorp Control Area (Exhibit C)

 In addition to its 38.02% share, Purchaser shapes 19.01% (50 MW/ 263 MW) of the Project for Seller at Mid-C (PPM Shaping Agreement)

 Purchaser's Capacity Share (Paragraph 4): (38.02% + 19.01%) x 263 MW = 150 MW

 Purchaser's Uncorrected Share (Paragraph 5):

 (150 MW/179 MW) x 100 = 83.80% of Metered Energy on PacifiCorp's system ( Paragraph 2)

 Allocation of Uncorrected Share to Purchaser (Paragraph 6)

 Purchaser's Uncorrected Allocation:

 20,000 MWh On Peak x 83.80% = 16,760 MWh On Peak

 30,000 MWh Off Peak x 83.80% = 25,140 MWh Off Peak

 Actual Allocation (Paragraph 7)

 Purchaser's Actual Allocation (Paragraph 7.1):

 30,000 MWh x 38.02% = 11,406 MWh On Peak

 40,000 MWh x 38.02% = 15,208 MWh Off Peak

 Shaped Actual Allocation (Paragraph 7.2):

 30,000 MWh x 19.01% = 5,703 MWh On Peak

 40,000 MWh x 19.01% = 7,604 MWh Off Peak

 Correction (Paragraph 8)

 On Peak Hours:

 Uncorrected Allocation (, Paragraph 6): 16,760 MWh

 Purchaser's Actual Allocation (Paragraph 7.1): 11,406 MWh

 Shaped Actual Allocation ( Paragraph 7.2): 5,703 MWh

 Total Actual Allocation (Paragraph 7.3): 11,406 + 5,703 = 17,109 MWh

 Correction for On Peak Hours (Paragraph 8): 16,760 MWh - 17,109 MWh = -349 MWh

 Purchaser receives Actual Allocation of 11,406 MWh and reduces shaped Energy for Seller by -349 MWh

 Off Peak Hours:

 Uncorrected Allocation (Paragraph 6): 25,140 MWh

 Purchaser's Actual Allocation (Paragraph 7.1): 15,208 MWh

 Shaped Actual Allocation (Paragraph 7.2): 7,604 MWh

 Total Actual Allocation (Paragraph 7.3): 15,208 + 7,604 = 22,812 MWh

 Correction for Off Peak Hours (Paragraph 8): 25,140 MWh - 22,812 MWh = 2,328 MWh

 Purchaser receives Actual Allocation of 15,208 MWh and increases shaped Energy for Seller by 2,328 MWh

 Spreading of Correction (Paragraph 9)

 Return Month is March 2003

 On Peak hours: (31 - 5) X 16 = 416 hours

 Off Peak hours: (31 - 5) X 8 +5 X 24 = 328 hours

 On Peak Hours:

 349 MWh / 416 hours = 0.8 MW ... round to 1 MW

 In March, every On Peak hour PPM shall receive 1 MW less of shaped Energy (total of 416 MWh)

 Remainder 1 X 416 = 416 MWh

 416 MWh - 349 MWh = 67 MWh

 In April, the Shaped Allocation to PPM will be increased by 67 MWh

 Off Peak Hours:

 2,328 MWh /328 hours = 7.1 MW, round to 7 MW

 Purchaser delivers to Seller 7 MW more each Off Peak hour to Seller than the Shaped Actual Allocation (a total of 2,296 MWh)

 Remainder 7 x 328 = 2,296 MWh

 2,328 MWh - 2,296 MWh = 32 MWh

 In April, the Shaped Allocation to Seller will be increased by 32 MWh.

 Exhibit G

 MEASUREMENT AND METERING PROVISIONS OF PROJECT PPA

 "Meter" shall mean an instrument or instruments meeting applicable Technical Requirements and electric industry standards used to measure and record the volume and other required delivery characteristics of the Energy delivered hereunder.

 "Technical Requirements" shall mean those codes, standards and specifications for the Meters that the Parties shall mutually agree upon, including without limitation, bi-directional measurement capabilities.

 MEASUREMENT AND METERING

 5.1 Metering Equipment.

 5.1.1 Seller shall provide, install, own, operate, and maintain all metering and data processing equipment needed for the registration, recording, and transmission of information regarding the Energy generated from the Turbines and delivered to the applicable Delivery Points, real and reactive power output, voltage output, current output, and other related parameters that are required for computing the payments due to Seller from Purchaser (the "Seller's Meters"). Seller shall install Seller's Meters on Purchaser's side of the existing Delivery Points. Seller shall, if requested by Purchaser and at the sole cost and expense of Purchaser, make such information available to Purchaser on a real- time basis by remote access. Seller's metering and data processing equipment shall meet or exceed the Technical Requirements. Seller may provide separate Meters for the measurement of all Expansion Energy generated from any Project Expansion and the provisions of this Agreement relating to installation, maintenance, operation and testing of Meters shall not be applicable to such other Meters.

 5.1.2 Purchaser may, at its own expense, install, maintain, and operate its own metering, telemetry and communication equipment for the purpose of comparison with Seller's metering equipment and observation of the Energy generation at the Project (the "Purchaser's Meters"); provided, however, that such equipment shall not interfere with the installation, maintenance and operation of Seller's metering equipment or the Seller Interconnection Facilities. Seller shall arrange for a location within or near the Seller's Meters, accessible to Seller and Purchaser, for such metering, telemetry and communication equipment to be installed.

 5.2 Measurements. Readings of Seller's Meters shall be conclusive as to the amount of Energy delivered under this Agreement; provided, however, that if any of Seller's Meters is out of service or is determined, pursuant to Section 8.3.5 hereof, to be registering inaccurately, measurement of Energy delivered hereunder shall be determined in the following sequence:

 5.2.1 by Purchaser's Meters, if they have been installed and are operational pursuant to Section 5.1.2; or

 5.2.2 by the computer monitoring system for each Turbine, using a mathematical calculation agreed upon by the Parties to adjust the output thereof to account for electrical losses in the gathering system and Turbine transformers and substation transformers up to the applicable Delivery Point; or

 5.2.3 by estimating by reference to quantities measured during periods of similar conditions when Seller's Meters were registering accurately; or

 5.2.4 if no reliable information exists as to the period over which such Meter was registering inaccurately, it shall be assumed for correction purposes hereunder that such inaccuracy was equal to (i) if the period of inaccuracy can be determined, the actual period during which inaccurate measurements were made; or (ii) if the period of inaccuracy cannot be determined, one-half of the period from the date of the last previous test of such Meter through the date of the adjustments, provided, however, that, in the case of clause (ii), the period covered by the correction shall not exceed six (6) months.

 5.3 Testing and Correction.

 5.3.1 The accuracy of Seller's Meters shall be tested and verified by Seller at least annually. Seller grants Purchaser the right to access, with reasonable notice to Seller and at reasonable times, Seller's Meters in order to test and verify the accuracy of Seller's Meters' measurements and recordings. Such inspections and verifications shall be at Purchaser's sole expense. If Purchaser has installed Meters in accordance with Section 5.1.2 hereof, Purchaser shall test and verify each Purchaser's Meters at least annually. Each Party shall bear the cost of the annual testing of its own Meters.

 5.3.2 Each Meter shall be accurate within a two percent (2%) variance. The following steps should be taken to resolve disputes regarding the accuracy of any Meter:

 5.3.2.1 If either Party disputes a Meter's accuracy or condition, it shall so advise the owner of the Meter in writing.

 5.3.2.2 The owner of the Meter shall, within fifteen (15) Days after receiving such notice, advise the disputing Party in writing as to its position concerning the Meter's accuracy and reasons for taking such position.

 5.3.2.3 If the Parties are unable to resolve their disagreement through reasonable negotiations, then either Party may submit such dispute to an unaffiliated third-party engineering company mutually acceptable to the Parties to test the Meter.

 5.3.2.4 Should the Meter be found to register within the permitted two percent (2%) variance, the disputing Party shall bear the cost of inspection; otherwise, the cost shall be borne by the owner of the Meter.

 5.3.2.5 Any repair or replacement shall be made at the expense of the owner of the Meter as soon as practicable, based on the third-party engineer's report.

 5.3.3 Following testing, corrections shall be made as follows:

 5.3.3.1 If any Meter is found to be accurate or to be in error by not more than the permitted two percent (2%) variance, previous recordings of such Meter shall be considered accurate in computing deliveries hereunder, and such Meter shall be promptly adjusted to record correctly.

 5.3.3.2 If any Meter is found to be in error by an amount exceeding the two percent (2%) variance, then such Meter shall be promptly adjusted to record correctly and any previous recordings by such Meter shall be adjusted in accordance with Section 8.2 hereof.

 5.3.3.3 If the difference of the payments actually made by Purchaser minus the adjusted payment is a positive number, Seller shall pay the difference to Purchaser; if the difference is a negative number, Purchaser shall pay the difference to Seller. In either case, the Party paying such difference shall also pay interest at the Prime Rate, and such payment (including such interest) shall be made within thirty (30) Days of receipt of a corrected invoice.

 5.4 Maintenance and Records. Within thirty (30) Days after the end of each calendar month, Seller shall provide to Purchaser a written monthly report, which shall include information on the Mechanical Availability Percentage, the Average Annual Output, the Summer Average Output and the Winter Average Output of the Turbines, summaries of production of the Turbines, any other significant events related to the operation of the Turbines, and any supporting information that Purchaser may reasonably request.

 5.5 Right to Audit. Purchaser shall have the right, upon reasonable notice to Seller and during Seller's regular business hours, to access all of Seller's records to audit the reports, data and calculations that Seller must provide to Purchaser under this Agreement. Purchaser shall bear the costs of such audit; provided, however, that Seller agrees to cooperate with such audit and shall not charge Purchaser for any reasonable costs (including without limitation the cost of photocopies) that Seller may incur as a result of such audit.

As of the date of this Agreement, the minimum hourly Walla Walla Load is approximately 200 MW.

 "WSCC" means the Western System Coordinating Council, or its successor organization.

 Section 2: Term & Termination

 2.1 Effective Date and Termination Date. This Agreement shall become effective (the "Effective Date") upon its execution by both Parties, but the effectiveness of this Agreement shall be subject to receipt of the approvals provided for in Section 2.2. Integration Service under this Agreement shall begin as of the Date of Initial Service. This Agreement shall remain in full force and effect, unless terminated pursuant to Sections 2.3, 2.4, 2.5 or 19, until December 31, 2011 (the "Term"). Delivery of Storage Energy will terminate on December 31, 2011 and delivery of Scheduled Energy will terminate on February 29, 2012.

 2.2 Regulatory Approval. PacifiCorp shall file this Agreement with FERC pursuant to its current FERC-approved market-based rate schedule. Within thirty (30) days following the date on which both Parties execute this Agreement, PacifiCorp shall file this Agreement with FERC and SCL shall, at PacifiCorp's request, file a letter supporting PacifiCorp's FERC filing. If FERC issues any order other than an order that accepts this Agreement for filing in its entirety without change, the Parties shall exercise commercially reasonable efforts either (a) to amend this Agreement to comply with the FERC order, or (b) to negotiate a replacement agreement, that in either case provides benefits similar to those provided under this Agreement to both Parties and that is expected to be accepted by FERC. The Parties shall enter into any such new amendment or agreement no later than sixty (60) days after the date on which FERC issues its order; provided, however, that if the Parties are unable to agree upon an amendment or a replacement agreement, this Agreement shall terminate sixty (60) days after the date on which FERC issues its order. Pending the issuance of a FERC order accepting this Agreement, the Parties have entered into a short-term interim agreement pursuant to PacifiCorp's FERC Electric Tariff, Volume No. 12, that incorporates the terms and conditions of this Agreement. The term of the short-term interim agreement shall not exceed one hundred eighty (180) days, and such agreement shall terminate automatically upon FERC's acceptance of this Agreement or an amendment or replacement of this Agreement entered into pursuant to this Section 2.2 or January 1, 2002 whichever is later.

 2.3 Termination and Suspension of Power Purchase Agreement.

 PacifiCorp acknowledges that this Agreement is based on SCL's purchase of energy and Environmental Attributes under the Power Purchase Agreement. Thus, to the extent that the Power Purchase Agreement terminates for a reason other than SCL's default or the mutual agreement of the parties under the Power Purchase Agreement, SCL reserves the right to terminate this Agreement on thirty (30) days written notice. To the extent the Power Purchase Agreement is suspended for a period greater than thirty (30) days because of an uncured failure by the developer of the State Line Wind Project to comply in any material respect with any federal, state or local law, regulation or ordinance applicable to the State Line Wind Project, SCL may opt to suspend its duty to deliver Storage Energy under this Agreement upon five (5) days notice to PacifiCorp (with PacifiCorp's duty to accept Storage Energy to be suspended as well). If any suspension under this Section 2.3 continues for a period of more than one hundred eighty (180) days, PacifiCorp shall have the right to terminate this Agreement in its sole discretion by providing SCL with thirty (30) days written notice.

 2.4 Revised Charges; Termination of Integration Services due to an Operational RTO. No earlier than one hundred eighty (180) days after the RTO Effective Date, PacifiCorp shall propose revised Variability Charge, Integration Charge, and the mechanism by which PacifiCorp will account for transmission losses affecting Storage Energy (collectively, "Revised Charges") by giving notice of the Revised Charges to SCL. The Revised Charges shall apply from the time period beginning ninety (90) days after the date of PacifiCorp's notice to SCL and continuing through the remainder of the Term. If SCL rejects the Revised Charges by written notice received by PacifiCorp no later than forty-five (45) days after the date on which SCL receives PacifiCorp's notice, this Agreement shall terminate ninety (90) days after the date on which SCL receives PacifiCorp's notice of the Revised Charges. Otherwise, this Agreement shall continue through the remainder of the Term using the Revised Charges in lieu of the Integration Charge and the Variability Charge.

 2.5 Network Generation Resource.

 (a) Inability to Maintain Storage Energy as a Network Generation Resource. PacifiCorp has determined that it is able to add the Storage Energy as a network generation resource to the network transmission service agreement between PacifiCorp and PacifiCorp Transmission. However, if after the Effective Date of this Agreement, PacifiCorp receives notice from PacifiCorp Transmission that PacifiCorp will be unable to maintain Storage Energy as a network generation resource despite PacifiCorp's commercially reasonable efforts, the Parties shall negotiate in good faith concerning a possible replacement arrangement that would provide equivalent benefits and burdens for each Party as are provided under this Agreement. PacifiCorp shall promptly notify SCL if it determines that it will be unable to maintain Storage Energy as a network generation resource. If the Parties are unable to agree to such an arrangement within forty-five (45) days after the date of PacifiCorp's notice, either Party may terminate this Agreement upon forty-five (45) days prior written notice to the other.

 (b) Additional Expense for Storage Energy as a Network Generation Resource. If after the Effective Date of this Agreement, PacifiCorp receives an invoice or other notice from PacifiCorp Transmission seeking to impose additional costs on PacifiCorp because PacifiCorp Transmission has designated the Storage Energy as a network generation resource, PacifiCorp shall promptly give SCL notice of such additional costs (the "Network Expense Notice"). Pending negotiations pursuant to this Section

 2.5(b), PacifiCorp and SCL shall each bear fifty percent (50%) of any cost incurred, due and payable to PacifiCorp Transmission (without waiving either Party's ability to challenge the appropriateness of such costs in a complaint before FERC or otherwise). If such additional costs are on-going, by five (5) days prior notice to PacifiCorp, SCL may elect to suspend its duty to deliver Storage Energy pursuant to this Agreement pending resolution of the following provisions (with PacifiCorp's duty to accept Storage Energy to be suspended as well). PacifiCorp shall use commercially reasonable efforts to obtain reasonably detailed information from PacifiCorp Transmission supporting such costs. The Parties shall use commercially reasonable efforts (i) to jointly determine whether the costs proposed by PacifiCorp Transmission are justified and correct, (ii) if not, to negotiate with PacifiCorp Transmission to appropriately adjust such costs, and (iii) to allocate such costs between the Parties on both a prospective and a retroactive basis. PacifiCorp acknowledges that SCL, as payer of fifty percent (50%) of any such additional costs (or such other allocation of additional costs as the Parties may agree upon pursuant to the provisions set forth above), will be harmed by any inappropriately imposed additional costs. Therefore, if requested by SCL, PacifiCorp shall make such assignment of obligations or other arrangements as are required for SCL to challenge such additional costs in a complaint proceeding, or for SCL to intervene in and protest any filing with the FERC by PacifiCorp Transmission for recovery of such additional costs. If the Parties are unable to agree upon the amount or allocation of such costs within ninety (90) days after the date on which SCL receives the Network Expense Notice (or, if SCL is challenging such costs before FERC, within ninety (90) days after the date on which FERC's decision on such challenge becomes final and unappealable), either Party may terminate this Agreement by giving forty-five (45) days prior notice to the other Party. If this Agreement is terminated pursuant to this Section 2.5(b), the Parties shall share equally the costs imposed by PacifiCorp Transmission and incurred before such termination date.

 2.6 Effect of Termination. If this Agreement terminates for any reason, the provisions of this Agreement shall remain in effect after any termination of the Agreement to the extent necessary to satisfy the terms and conditions of this Agreement (including the delivery of any Scheduled Energy that PacifiCorp is required to deliver with respect to Storage Energy delivered before the termination date) and to provide for final billings and adjustments related to (a) the period before termination, (b) the delivery of Scheduled Energy, and (c) payment of any money due and owing either Party pursuant to this Agreement.

 Section 3: Integration Service

 3.1 Delivery of Storage Energy. To allow PacifiCorp to provide the Integration Service, SCL shall deliver during the Term all Storage Energy attributable to the Integration Amount to PacifiCorp at the Point of Receipt. The Parties acknowledge that, on an instantaneous basis, the amount of Storage Energy delivered is the total energy associated with the Interconnected Portion actually delivered to the Point of Receipt multiplied by the Delivery Percentage. Except to the extent that Storage Energy varies because of wind conditions, SCL shall only be able to change the Integration Amount pursuant to Sections 3.3 and 18 of this Agreement.

 3.2 Designation of Storage Energy as a Network Generation Resource. During the Term and subject to Section 2.5 of this Agreement, PacifiCorp shall accept the Storage Energy at the Point of Receipt and designate it as a network generation resource pursuant to the network transmission agreement in effect between PacifiCorp and PacifiCorp Transmission.

 3.3 Minimum Walla Walla Load.

 (a) Notice of Walla Walla Load Decreases. PacifiCorp shall forecast the Walla Walla Load in accordance with Prudent Industry Practices. If the Walla Walla Load is expected to fall (or does in fact fall) below the Integration Amount in any hour, PacifiCorp shall provide SCL with at least thirty (30) days advance notice of the expected timing and amount of the reduction in the Walla Walla Load; provided, however, that if the Walla Walla Load falls (or is expected to fall) below the Integration Amount in any hour because of an event not anticipated by PacifiCorp in forecasting conducted in accordance with Prudent Industry Practices and PacifiCorp is therefore unable to give SCL at least thirty (30) days advance notice of the Walla Walla Load reduction, PacifiCorp shall provide as much advance notice of the Walla Walla Load reduction as is reasonably possible in the circumstances (but in no event less than sixty [60] minutes before the hour of delivery).

 (b) SCL's Options in the Event of Walla Walla Load Decreases. By notice given to PacifiCorp ten (10) days after SCL's receipt of a notice of a Walla Walla Load decrease (or by telephonic notice given within such shorter period as may be available before the hour of delivery), SCL may elect one or a combination of the following options:

 (1) to reduce the Integration Amount so that it is less than the projected minimum Walla Walla Load;

 (2) to provide PacifiCorp, at SCL's expense, with firm point- to-point transmission rights from the Walla Walla 230 kV bus to the Wanapum generation bus in an amount equal to the amount by which PacifiCorp's Walla Walla Load falls (or is expected to fall) below the Integration Amount; or

 (3) subject to (z) below, if SCL is unable to obtain such firm point-to-point transmission rights despite its reasonably diligent efforts to do so, SCL may provide PacifiCorp, at SCL's expense, with non-firm point-to-point transmission rights from the Walla Walla 230 kV bus to the Wanapum generation bus until such time as SCL is able, using reasonably diligent efforts, to obtain such firm point-to-point transmission rights; provided, however, that

 (x) if PacifiCorp gives such notice within one (1) week before the actual hour of delivery, it shall do so by telephoning the party or parties designated by SCL in writing for that purpose, which party or parties shall be deemed authorized to elect option (1), (2) or (3) above (or a combination of those options) on behalf of SCL;

 (y) to the extent that SCL or the party or parties designated by SCL elect option (3) above and transmission ceases to be available under such non-firm transmission rights, SCL shall immediately reduce the Integration Amount so that it is less than the Walla Walla Load; and

 (z) if the Walla Walla Load falls (or is expected to fall) below the Integration Amount for the reasonably foreseeable long- term future, SCL shall be required to choose between option (1) or option (2).

 SCL shall implement option (1), (2) or (3) (or a combination thereof), as applicable, for the duration of the period in which the Walla Walla Load is expected to be below the Integration Amount and sufficiently in advance of that period to allow PacifiCorp to plan for the use of and pre-schedule any such transmission rights pursuant to Prudent Industry Practices and the requirements of PacifiCorp Transmission or the Operational RTO, as the case may be.

 (c) Walla Walla Load Increases. In the event PacifiCorp's projected minimum Walla Walla Load subsequently increases so as to allow PacifiCorp to accept an amount of Storage Energy, on an instantaneous basis, up to the Integration Amount prior to such reduction, PacifiCorp shall promptly notify SCL in writing of the additional amount that PacifiCorp is able to accept. SCL shall promptly respond in writing as to SCL's desire to have PacifiCorp integrate an incremental amount of energy , not to exceed the amount specified in PacifiCorp's notice.

 3.4 Environmental Attributes. PacifiCorp shall not market or resell any Environmental Attributes associated with Storage Energy. As between SCL and PacifiCorp, SCL shall retain the exclusive right to all Environmental Attributes associated with the Storage Energy. At SCL's request, PacifiCorp shall from time to time provide to SCL such attestations and other documents as may be reasonably required to confirm that PacifiCorp is in compliance with this Section 3.4.

 3.5 Integration Service. During the Term, PacifiCorp shall accept Storage Energy at the Point of Receipt. PacifiCorp shall store such Storage Energy during each Generation Month during the Term until such time as Scheduled Energy is scheduled to SCL at the Point of Delivery pursuant to Section 5 of this Agreement. PacifiCorp shall maintain separate accounts of Off Peak Storage Energy and On Peak Storage Energy delivered during each Generation Month. PacifiCorp shall deliver Scheduled Energy by scheduling delivery of Scheduled Energy to SCL beginning on the first day of the Return Month that is two months following the Date of Initial Service and continuing through the Term. For example, if the Date of Initial Service is January 1, 2002, PacifiCorp shall schedule Storage Energy associated with the Generation Month of January 2002 to SCL as Scheduled Energy during the Return Month of March 2002.

 3.6 Losses Between Point of Metering and Point of Receipt. The losses between the Point of Metering and the Point of Receipt shall be zero (0)% for the purposes of this Agreement. If the calculated losses associated with the physical electrical path from the Point of Metering to the Point of Receipt change after the date on which this Agreement is executed, either Party may request a new value for this loss percentage by giving written notice to the other Party describing in reasonable detail the basis of the proposed change in the loss percentage. The proposed loss percentage will

 be subject to the other Party's consent, which the other Party shall not unreasonably withhold, condition or delay. The new loss percentage will apply prospectively from the date of the written notice.

 3.7 Operating Reserves. As an ongoing condition to and partial compensation for PacifiCorp's duty to provide the services contemplated by this Agreement, SCL shall provide PacifiCorp with Operating Reserves equal to ten percent (10%) of the Integration Amount delivered to the Point of Delivery. PacifiCorp may call upon these Operating Reserves pursuant to the guidelines of the Northwest Power Pool or any successor organization. PacifiCorp shall not call upon these Operating Reserves on a discriminatory basis relative to other reserve resources available to PacifiCorp. The Parties shall schedule the use of these Operating Reserves pursuant to Section 5.2 of this Agreement. During the clock hour following PacifiCorp's use of the Operating Reserves, PacifiCorp shall return to SCL at the Point of Delivery an amount of energy equal to the amount of energy, if any, that PacifiCorp used from the Operating Reserves in the preceding clock hour.

 3.8 Measurement and Metering. Readings of the meter recognized by PacifiCorp Transmission at the Point of Metering shall be conclusive as to the amount of Storage Energy delivered under this Agreement; provided, however, that if any such meter is out of service or is determined to be registering inaccurately, measurement of Storage Energy delivered under this Agreement shall be determined in the following sequence:

 (a) by Check Meters, if they have been installed and are operational; or

 (b) by using the hourly integrated instantaneous MW value used to monitor the composite turbine output from the computer monitoring system (i) to compare to the hourly meter reading of the Project Developer's Meters to determine the beginning of the deviation event, and (ii) by using the integrated instantaneous MW value from beginning of the deviation event to the time when the meter was back in-service or repaired to estimate Storage Energy delivered; or

 (c) by the computer monitoring system for each turbine, using a mathematical calculation developed pursuant to the Power Purchase Agreement (subject to PacifiCorp's approval, which PacifiCorp shall not unreasonably withhold, condition or delay) to adjust the output thereof to account for electrical losses in the gathering system and turbine transformers and substation transformers up to the Point of Receipt; or

 (d) by estimating the unmeasured or inaccurately measured quantities by referring to the measurements made during other comparable time periods having similar conditions when the project developer's meters were registering accurately, or

 (e) if no reliable information exists as to the period over which the meter at the Point of Metering was registering inaccurately, by assuming for correction purposes under this Agreement that such inaccuracy was equal to (i) if the period of inaccuracy can be determined, the actual period during which inaccurate measurements were made; or (ii) if the period of inaccuracy cannot be determined, one-half of the period from the date of the last

 previous test of such meter through the date of the adjustments, provided, however, that, in the case of clause (ii), the period covered by the correction shall not exceed six months.

 To the extent that the adjustment period covers a period of deliveries for which payment has already been made by SCL under this Agreement, the difference between the original bills paid and the recomputed bills, based on adjusted metering information, shall be paid to the Party entitled to receive such amount not later than thirty (30) days after the owing Party receives notice of the amount due. Adjustment schedules for prior deliveries of On-Peak Scheduled Energy and/or Off-Peak Scheduled Energy, due to inaccurate metering, shall be arranged as soon as possible between the Parties' schedulers; provided, however, that such adjustment schedules shall be arranged not later than one hundred eighty (180) days after the Party owing such energy receives notice of the energy amount owed. For example, if it is determined that less energy was generated than was stored as Storage Energy, then the Parties shall reduce the amount of Scheduled Energy appropriately. Likewise, if it is determined that more energy was generated than stored as Storage Energy, then the Parties shall increase the amount of Scheduled Energy appropriately.

 Section 4: Point of Receipt, Point of Delivery

 4.1 Point of Receipt. The Point of Receipt for On-Peak Storage Energy and Off-Peak Storage Energy shall be at the 230 kV level of PacifiCorp's Wallula substation in Walla Walla County, Washington, as shown on the one-line diagram attached as Exhibit A.

 4.2 Point of Delivery. The Point of Delivery for Scheduled Energy and for energy associated with Operating Reserves shall be the Mid-Columbia or as mutually agreed by the Parties, schedulers and dispatchers.

 Section 5: Scheduling/Provision of Operating Reserves

 5.1 Scheduled Energy Scheduling. During each Return Month, the Parties shall pre-schedule On-Peak Scheduled Energy and Off-Peak Scheduled Energy by 1000 hours Pacific Prevailing Time on the mutually recognized pre-scheduling day before the day(s) of delivery, for delivery at the Point of Delivery. The hourly rate of delivery shall be determined by taking the total megawatt-hours contained in the On-Peak Storage Energy account or Off-Peak Storage Energy account, as applicable, accrued during the Generation Month (after adjustment for losses pursuant to the definition of

 Scheduled Energy), and then dividing by the number of On-Peak Hours, or Off-Peak Hours as the case may be, in the Return Month. An example showing how the hourly rate of delivery would be determined in certain stated circumstances is attached as Exhibit C. The rate of delivery shall be rounded down to the nearest whole megawatt with any remaining amounts as a result of rounding to be held in the applicable Storage Energy account until the next Return Month. Notwithstanding the above provisions, the Parties' schedulers may mutually agree upon different delivery hours, delivery points or rates of delivery as necessary to fulfill the total monthly obligations of both Parties.

 5.2 Provision of Operating Reserves. PacifiCorp and SCL shall arrange for the receipt and schedule the return of energy associated with Operating Reserves pursuant to then applicable WSCC and applicable Operational RTO scheduling criteria such that PacifiCorp may consider such Operating Reserves as being generation reserves held by PacifiCorp. The purpose of such Operating Reserves will be to enable PacifiCorp to comply with the requirements of the Northwest Power Pool or successor organization. Notwithstanding the provisions of this Section 5.2, the Parties' real-time schedulers may mutually agree upon different delivery points or delivery hours for the return of energy associated with such Operating Reserves or for the payment of cash in lieu of the return of such energy.

 5.3 Records of Deliveries. All deliveries under this Agreement shall be deemed to be made during the hours and in the amounts as accounted for in SCL's and PacifiCorp's records; provided, however, if deliveries of Scheduled Energy are interrupted pursuant to a Transmission Constraint or pursuant to Section 18 (Uncontrollable Forces), such schedules shall be adjusted to reflect the interruption. The Parties shall mutually agree to schedule any undelivered On-Peak Scheduled Energy or Off-Peak Scheduled Energy during subsequent On-Peak Hours or Off-Peak Hours and at increased rates of delivery; provided further, if mutual agreement is not reached, PacifiCorp shall schedule additional amounts evenly during applicable On-Peak Hours or Off-Peak Hours similar to the On-Peak Hours or Off-Peak Hours during which the curtailing event occurred and as necessary to schedule such undelivered amounts of energy to SCL within four weeks following the curtailing event.

 Section 6: Integration Charge, Variability Charge

 6.1 Integration Charge.

 (a) Capacity and Energy Rates. During the Term, SCL shall pay PacifiCorp, pursuant to the provisions of Section 7, an Integration Charge at the capacity and energy rates specified below in Table A; provided, however, that if PacifiCorp provides Integration Service for less than a full calendar month, then PacifiCorp's invoice shall prorate the capacity portion of the Integration Charge based on the number of days in the calendar month during which PacifiCorp provided such service.

 Table A, Integration Charge

 Calendar Capacity Billing Energy Determinant Year ($/kw-mo) Determinant (in (@/MWh) in MWh) (i) kw-mo) (iii) (iv) (ii)

 2002 $1.075 Integration Amount $2.45 Storage Energy 2003 $1.075 Integration Amount $2.65 Storage Energy 2004 $1.075 Integration Amount $2.75 Storage Energy 2005 $1.075 Integration Amount $2.80 Storage Energy 2006 $1.075 Integration Amount $2.85 Storage Energy 2007 $1.075 Integration Amount $2.95 Storage Energy 2008 $1.075 Integration Amount $3.00 Storage Energy 2009 $1.075 Integration Amount $3.10 Storage Energy 2010 $1.075 Integration Amount $3.15 Storage Energy 2011 $1.075 Integration Amount $3.25 Storage Energy

 (b) Billing Determinants. The billing determinant for the capacity portion of the Integration Charge shall be the Integration Amount. The billing determinant for the energy portion of the Integration Charge shall be the amount of Storage Energy received by PacifiCorp at the Point of Receipt during the applicable Generation Month.

 (c) Adjustments to Integration Amount. During any Generation Month in which Section 3.3(b)(1) or 3.3(c) of this Agreement applies, the capacity charge ($1.075/kW-month) shall be prorated to a $/kW-day charge and calculated day-to-day based on the daily Integration Amount during such Generation Month. If an Uncontrollable Force and/or a suspension under Section 2.3 of this Agreement reduces the Integration Amount by at least 25 MW for at least twenty (20) days during a Generation Month, the capacity charge ($1.075/kW-month) shall be prorated to a $/kW-day charge and calculated day-to-day based on the daily Integration Amount during such Generation Month, until the Uncontrollable Force has been removed.

 6.2 Variability Charge. During the Term, in addition to the amounts provided for in Section 6.1, SCL shall pay PacifiCorp, pursuant to the provisions of Section 7, each month a Variability Charge at the rate specified below in Table B for each 1,000 kilowatts of Standard Deviation; provided, however, that if PacifiCorp provides Integration Service for less than a full calendar month, then PacifiCorp's invoice shall prorate the $/month rate contained in Table B based on the number of days in the calendar month during which PacifiCorp provided such service. An Example showing the calculation of the amount due as a Variability Charge in a given hypothetical month is set forth in Exhibit C.

 Table B, Variability Charge

 Calendar Variability Charge Year ($/per 1,000 kilowatts of Standard Deviation per month) i

 2002 $5,600 2003 $5,650 2004 $5,791 2005 $5,936 2006 $6,084 2007 $6,237 2008 $6,392 2009 $6,552 2010 $6,716 2011 $6,884

 6.3 Fixed Pricing Methodology. The pricing contained in this Section 6 shall remain in effect through the Term. Neither Party shall petition the FERC pursuant to the provisions of Section 205 or 206 of the Federal Power Act to amend such prices absent the agreement in writing of the other Party.

 6.4 Example. An example illustrating the calculation of the Invoice/Storage/Return Charge and the Variability Charge for a given calendar month, under certain stated assumptions, is set forth on Exhibit C.

 6.5 Adjustment to Integration Amount. SCL may propose to increase the Integration Amount by up to 50 MW for periods on and after January 1, 2004. If SCL does so, PacifiCorp and SCL shall negotiate in good faith to determine the terms and conditions under which PacifiCorp would be willing to increase the Integration Amount.

 Section 7: Billing and Payment

 7.1 Monthly Billings. No later than the 15th day of each month following a Generation Month, PacifiCorp shall bill SCL for charges applicable to the Generation Month determined in accordance with Section 6 as follows:

 (a) Integration Service Charge. Based on Section 6.1, Table A, the Integration Charge shall equal [(i) x (ii)] + [(iii) x (iv)], where

 (i) is the capacity charge ($/kw-mo),

 (ii) is the capacity billing determinant (in kw) applicable to the Generation Month;

 (iii) is the energy charge ($/MWh); and

 (iv) is the amount of Storage Energy received by PacifiCorp during the Generation Month.

 (b) Variability Charge. Based on Section 6.2, Table B, the Variability Charge shall equal [(i) x (ii)], where

 (i) is the $/month rate; and

 (ii) is each 1,000 kilowatts (calculated to three decimal places, e.g., 30,003 kilowatts = 30.003 MW) of Standard Deviation.

 PacifiCorp shall transmit the bill to SCL by fax. Each faxed bill shall contain detail sufficient to allow SCL to verify the billing. This Agreement shall be specifically excluded from inclusion in the consolidated settlement under the Mutual Netting Agreement between the Parties dated January 26, 1999.An example illustrating the calculation of the Integration Charge and Variability Charge billing, under certain stated assumptions, is attached as Exhibit C.

 7.2 Payments to PacifiCorp. SCL shall pay all amounts due PacifiCorp by electronic wire transfer by the later of ten (10) days after receipt of the bill or the twentieth (20th) of the month in accordance with written wire transfer instructions given by PacifiCorp to SCL from time to time; provided, however, that any changes to such wire transfer instructions shall not be effective until two (2) Business Days after the date on which notice of the change is sent to SCL. If the due date is not a Business Day, Purchaser shall pay the monthly bill on the Business Day following such due date.. Initially, payment for all services provided under this Agreement are to be electronically wire transferred to BankOne, ABA No. 071000013, for credit to PacifiCorp Account No. 5544688.

 7.3 Interest on Unpaid Amounts. In the event either Party has not paid the full amount due on or before close of business on the due date, the owing Party shall pay interest on the unpaid amount for each day it is late at a rate equal to (a) the Prime Rate plus 200 basis points, divided by (b) 360, or the rate allowed by law, whichever is less.

 7.4 Credit Support.

 (a) Demand. During the Term, if a Material Adverse Change affects PacifiCorp or SCL, the other Party, in its discretion, may require the Party experiencing the Material Adverse Change to provide Credit Support sufficient to assure that the Party experiencing the Material Adverse Change will continue to meet its current contractual obligations under this Agreement and its contractual obligations for the next twelve (12) Months from the date of demand for Credit Support (or if the remaining Term of this Agreement is less than twelve (12) Months, for the remaining Term of this Agreement). PacifiCorp may provide such Credit Support either directly or through an Affiliate of PacifiCorp.

 (b) Maintenance of Credit Support. Following a demand for Credit Support and until such time as the Party is no longer experiencing a Material Adverse Change, the Party experiencing the Material Adverse Change shall maintain satisfactory Credit Support on an ongoing, rolling basis sufficient to assure its current contractual obligations and its contractual obligations for the following twelve (12) calendar months. At the request of either Party Credit Support shall be increased or decreased as appropriate once per calendar month such that the Party providing Credit Support will be able to meet its then-current contractual obligations and its contractual obligations under this Agreement for the next twelve (12) calendar month period (or if the remaining Term of this Agreement is less than twelve (12) calendar months, for the remaining Term of this Agreement).

 (c) PacifiCorp Credit Support. If PacifiCorp is experiencing a Material Adverse Change, PacifiCorp's Credit Support for the above period shall be in an amount sufficient to provide replacement integration services that would be delivered for the above referenced twelve (12) Month period under this Agreement.

 (d) SCL Credit Support. If SCL is experiencing a Material Adverse Change, SCL's Credit Support for the above period shall be in an amount sufficient to cover anticipated receivables for the above referenced twelve (12) Month period under this Agreement.

 (e) Failure to Provide or Maintain Credit Support. If the Party experiencing a Material Adverse Change fails to provide required Credit Support within ten (10) Days of the request for Credit Support or fails to maintain Credit Support as provided above, the requesting Party may suspend its performance under this Agreement until the required Credit Support is posted or may treat the failure to provide Credit Support as a default and exercise its rights under Section 19 of this Agreement.

 7.5 Financial Information. At a Party's written request, the other Party shall furnish the requesting Party financial information as may be reasonably required to confirm that the other Party has not been affected by a Material Adverse Change. Either Party may assign its Credit Support obligation to a guarantor that will be able to meet the minimum credit standards set forth in the definition of Material Adverse Change.

 7.6 Assignment of Credit Support Obligation. Either party may assign its Credit Support obligation to a guarantor that will be able to meet the minimum credit standards set forth in the definition of Material Adverse Change.

 Section 8: Audit Rights; Disputes

 8.1 Audit Rights; Maintenance of Records. Each Party shall have the right, upon reasonable notice to the other Party and during regular business hours, to access all of the other Party's metering records, accounting records and supporting documents of any billing or delivery of energy associated with this Agreement. Each Party shall keep complete and accurate records, and shall maintain such records as may be necessary for the purpose of ascertaining the accuracy of all relevant data estimates, statements of charges or invoices until the later of (a) two (2) years from the date of that invoice, or (b) if there is a dispute relating to that invoice, the date on which the dispute is resolved. Each Party shall bear the costs of their own audit; provided, however, that the other Party agrees to cooperate with the audit and shall not charge for any reasonable costs (including without limitation the cost of photocopies) that the other Party may incur as a result of such audit. Should the audit discover an over-billing error or errors, PacifiCorp shall compensate SCL the amount of the error plus interest at the rate specified in Section 7.3. Such interest will accrue from the date on which SCL paid the overbilled amount to PaciCorp. Should the audit discover an under-billing error or errors, SCL shall compensate PacifiCorp the amount of the error plus interest at the rate specified in Section 7.3. Such interest will accrue from the date on which SCL should have paid the underbilled amount to PacifiCorp.

 8.2 Disputed Invoices. If SCL disputes an invoice, it shall give to PacifiCorp a reasonably detailed notice of any alleged error and explain the basis for the alleged error. Notwithstanding any such dispute, SCL shall pay the disputed amount when due. If PacifiCorp notifies SCL in writing within thirty (30) Days of receipt of such notice that PacifiCorp disagrees with the allegation of error, the Parties shall meet, by telephone conference call or otherwise, within five (5) Business Days of PacifiCorp's response for the purpose of attempting to resolve the dispute. If the Parties are unable to resolve the dispute within thirty (30) Days after their initial meeting, either Party may proceed to seek whatever remedy may be available to that Party at law or in equity. If PacifiCorp is found to be in error, PacifiCorp will refund to SCL the amount that SCL paid in excess of the amount that SCL actually owed pursuant to Section 7.1 above, plus interest on such excess payment at the rate specified in Section 7.3. Such interest will accrue from the later of (a) the date on which SCL paid the disputed amount to PacifiCorp, or (b) the date on which SCL gives PacifiCorp notice of the dispute, until the date on which SCL receives payment in full of the amount owed to it.

 8.3 Corrected Invoices. If PacifiCorp identifies an error in an invoice, it shall promptly give SCL a reasonably detailed notice describing the nature and effect of the error. If SCL notifies PacifiCorp in writing within thirty (30) Days of receipt of such notice that SCL disagrees with the allegation of an error, the Parties shall meet, by telephone conference call or otherwise, within five (5) Business Days of SCL's response for the purpose of attempting to resolve the dispute. If the Parties are unable to resolve the dispute within thirty (30) Days after their initial meeting, either Party may proceed to seek whatever remedy may be available to that Party at law or in equity. If the error requires PacifiCorp to reimburse SCL for amounts previously paid by SCL, PacifiCorp shall promptly reimburse SCL for such amounts or credit SCL for such amounts in the next invoice to SCL plus interest on such amount at the rate specified in Section 7.3. Such interest will accrue from the date on which SCL paid the disputed amount to PacifiCorp. If the error requires SCL to pay PacifiCorp additional amounts, PacifiCorp shall add the amount owed to a subsequent invoice. plus interest on such amount at the rate specified in Section 7.3. Such interest will accrue from the later of (a) the date on which SCL payment was due, or (b) the date on which PacifiCorp gives SCL notice of the dispute. To the extent either Party identifies an invoice error that impacts the previous delivery of Scheduled Energy, adjustment schedules for prior deliveries of On-Peak Scheduled Energy and/or Off-Peak Scheduled Energy, due to an inaccurate invoice, shall be arranged as soon as possible between the Parties' schedulers; provided, however, that such adjustment schedules shall be arranged not later than one hundred eighty (180) days after the Parties determine that such energy is owed pursuant to the provisions of this Section 8.3. For example, if it is determined that less Scheduled Energy was delivered to SCL than appropriate, then the Parties shall increase the amount of future Scheduled Energy appropriately. Likewise, if it is determined that more Scheduled Energy was delivered to SCL than appropriate, then the Parties shall decrease the amount of future Scheduled Energy appropriately.

 8.4 Time Limits on Disputes and Corrections. Until the second anniversary of the date on which SCL receives an invoice, (a) SCL may dispute the invoice under Section 8.2, and (b) PacifiCorp may give SCL a notice correcting the invoice under Section 8.3. An invoice that has not been disputed under Section 8.2 or noticed for correction under Section 8.3 before such second anniversary shall be conclusive, final and no longer subject to adjustment.

 Section 9: Assignment

 9.1 General Rule. Neither Party may assign its rights or delegate its duties under this Agreement without the consent of the other Party, which the other Party shall not unreasonably withhold, condition or delay. The assigning Party will remain liable under the Agreement. Any assignment in breach of this Section 9 shall be void.

 9.2 Exception to Consent Requirement. SCL's consent shall not be required if, and only if, PacifiCorp assigns its full rights and delegates all of its duties under this Agreement to (a) a party that purchases all or substantially all of PacifiCorp's assets, (b) the survivor of a merger of PacifiCorp with another person, (c) to a third party controlled by or under common control with PacifiCorp.

 Section 18: Uncontrollable Forces

 No Party shall be considered to be in default under this Agreement or in breach of this Agreement if it is delayed or prevented from performing its duties under this Agreement due to uncontrollable forces. For purposes of this Agreement, the term "uncontrollable forces" shall mean any act of God or any other casualty or occurrence, condition, event or circumstance of any kind or nature not reasonably within the excused Party's control (including, without limitation, acts or omissions of any utility regulatory authority or other governmental authority such as a taking by condemnation or power of eminent domain); requirement of any governmental authority; transmission outages or sudden or disruptive electrical events or disturbances; strikes; slow downs or labor difficulties (even though such difficulties could be resolved by conceding to the demands of a labor group); fires; flood; earthquakes; explosions; vehicular accidents or other hazards; acts of public enemies; riots; civil commotions; insurrection; and unavailability of supplies or delays in deliveries by suppliers, vendors or subcontractors of any Party, to the extent such suppliers, vendors or subcontractors are subject to an event of the type described in this sentence; any event considered to be a force majeure event under the Power Purchase Agreement; provided, however, that neither a Party's financial inability to perform any payment obligation pursuant to this Agreement nor any change in a Party's financial condition shall constitute an uncontrollable force. SCL represents and warrants to Pacificorp that a true and correct copy of the force majeure provisions from the Power Purchase Agreement is attached as Exhibit D. SCL shall not amend these provisions without PacifiCorp's prior written consent (which PacifiCorp may not unreasonably withhold, condition or delay). Nothing contained in this Section 18 shall be construed so as to require a Party to settle any strike or labor dispute in which it may be involved. Any Party rendered unable to fulfill any obligation by reason of uncontrollable forces shall exercise due diligence to remove such inability with all reasonable dispatch.

 Section 19: Defaults and Remedies

 19.1 Defaults. The following events shall constitute defaults under this Agreement:

 (a) Failure of a Party to perform any material duty imposed upon that Party by this Agreement, including its duty to make payment when due;

 (b) Filing of a petition in bankruptcy by or against a Party if such petition is not withdrawn or dismissed within sixty (60) days after it is filed;

 (c) Assignment by a Party for the benefit of creditors;

 (d) Allowance by a Party of the appointment of a receiver or trustee of all or any part of its property if such receiver or trustee is not discharged within sixty (60) days after such appointment;

 (e) Failure of SCL to provide credit support within ten (10) days as required by Section 7.4;

 (f) Failure of SCL to post or maintain credit support pursuant to Section 7.4

 (g) Failure of PacifiCorp to provide credit support within ten (10) days as required by Section 7.4;

 (h) Failure of PacifiCorp to post or maintain credit support pursuant to Section 7.4.

 19.2 Notice of Default. The Party in default under this Agreement shall be referred to as the "Defaulting Party," and the other Party shall be referred to as the "Non-Defaulting Party." The Non- Defaulting Party shall have the right to give the Defaulting Party a written Notice of Default, which shall describe the default in reasonable detail and state the date by which the default must be cured.

 19.3 Opportunity to Cure. In the case of a default described in Section 19.1 (b), (c), (d), (e) and (f) there will be no cure period and no opportunity to outside of any time period expressly stated in such section. In the case of a failure to pay money when due, the default must be cured within ten (10) days after the Defaulting Party's receipt of the Notice of Default by payment of the amount due plus interest as provided in Section 7.3 from the date due until paid. In the case of all other defaults, the default must be cured within thirty (30) days after the Defaulting Party's receipt of the Notice of Default, except as provided in the next sentence. If the Defaulting Party cures the default within the applicable cure period, or if the failure is one (other than the failure to make payments or post credit support) that cannot in good faith be corrected within the thirty (30) day cure period and the Defaulting Party begins to correct the default within the cure period and thereafter continues corrective efforts with reasonable diligence until a cure is effected, the Notice of Default shall be inoperative, and the Defaulting Party shall lose no rights under this Agreement. If, within the specified period, the Defaulting Party does not cure the default or begin to cure the default as provided above, the Non-Defaulting Party may exercise the remedies set forth in Section 19.4.

 19.4 Rights upon Default. After providing notice and an opportunity to cure as provided above, the Non-Defaulting Party shall have the right (but not the duty) to terminate this Agreement by giving written notice to the Defaulting Party.

 19.5 Remedies Not Exclusive. Except as limited by Section 10.1, each and every power and remedy given to the Non-Defaulting Party shall be in addition to every other power and remedy now or hereafter available to the Non-Defaulting Party at law or in equity (including the right to specific performance). No delay or omission in the exercise of any power or remedy and no renewal or extension of any performance due under this Agreement shall impair any such power or remedy or waive any default.

 19.6 Net Out of Payables Upon Termination. Without limiting its remedies under this Agreement, upon termination of this Agreement for default, the Non-Defaulting Party may elect to aggregate all payments due and amounts otherwise owing under this Agreement into a single amount by netting out (a) all payments and other amounts that are due to the Defaulting Party under this Agreement, plus, at the option of the Non-Defaulting Party, any cash or other form of security then available to the Non-Defaulting Party pursuant to Section 7, against (b) all payments and other amounts that are due to the Non-Defaulting Party under this Agreement, so that all such amounts shall be netted out to a single liquidated amount (the "Termination Payment") payable by one Party to the other within thirty (30) days of the date on which the Non-Defaulting Party notifies the Defaulting Party of the amount of the Termination Payment. The Termination Payment shall be payable to or from the Non-Defaulting Party, as appropriate.

 19.7 Closeout Setoffs. After calculation of the Termination Payment in accordance with Section 19.6, if the Defaulting Party would be owed the Termination Payment, the Non-Defaulting Party shall be entitled, at its option and in its discretion, to set off against such Termination Payment any amounts due and owing by the Defaulting Party to the Non-Defaulting Party under any other agreements, instruments or undertakings between the Defaulting Party and the Non-Defaulting Party.

 19.8 Setoff. If City Light fails to pay PacifiCorp when such payment is due under this Agreement, PacifiCorp may give City Light a notice of nonpayment and suspension. If City Light does not cure the nonpayment within two (2) business days, PacifiCorp may suspend deliveries of Scheduled Energy to the extent necessary to set off the nonpayment (with the value of such Scheduled Energy for setoff purposes to be based on the price per MWh at Mid-Columbia for the delivery of firm energy for the applicable hours and period, as published in the Dow Jones Mid-Columbia Electricity Index or its sucessor). Upon receipt of payment in full from City Light, any deliveries so suspended shall be made up by re-scheduling the delivery of Scheduled Energy in a commercially reasonable manner. If SCL's failure to pay continues for more than ten (10) days after PacifiCorp's initial notice, PacifiCorp may in addition declare an event of default under Section 19.2.

 Section 20: Representations and Warranties

 Exhibit A

 POINT OF METERING

 Exhibit B-1

 STATE LINE WIND PROJECT DESCRIPTION

 The Project will be located on private agricultural land located in Umatilla County, Oregon and Walla Walla County, Washington, as more fully set forth in Exhibit B-2, on which Project Developer will obtain wind energy leases or other possessory real estate rights with the landowners. The real estate rights will allow Project Developer to construct and operate wind generation facilities for a defined term; and in exchange, each landowner will receive financial compensation.

 The wind generation facilities include the Turbines more fully described in Exhibits B-2 and B-3 and the electrical system. The Project's electrical system will consist of two key elements: (1) a collector system, which will collect Energy at 690 volts from each wind turbine increased to 34.5 kV by a pad-mounted transformer and connect it to the Project substation; and (2) the substation, which will transform Energy from 34.5 kV to 230kV (and 115 kV if interconnected to the BPA Transmission System).

 The collector system consists of the padmount transformers and the 34.5 kV electric cables. Each Turbine will generate power at 690 volts. A transformer adjacent to each tower will transform the power to 34.5 kV. Transformers will be located on a transformer pad located approximately 5 feet from the tower pad. From there, power will be transmitted via a combination of underground and overhead 34.5 kV electric cables.

 The substation site will occupy approximately 1 to 2 acres in an area just east of Hatch Grade Road in Washington. The substation site will be a graveled, fenced area with transformer and switching equipment and an area to park utility vehicles. Transformers will be non-polychlorinated biphenyl (PCB) oil-filled types.

 Exhibit B-2

 PROJECT MAP

 Exhibit B-3

 The Project consists of approximately 187 Vestas V-47-660-kW wind turbines located in Walla Walla County, Washington, as more fully set forth in Exhibit B-2. Wind turbines consist of two main components; the turbine tower and the nacelle. The nacelle is the portion of the wind turbine mounted at the top of the tower, which houses the wind turbine itself, the rotor and blades, hub, and gearbox.

 Nacelle: The V-47-660-kW wind turbines operate at wind speeds from 4 to 25 meters per second (m/s) at a relatively constant ( + 10 percent) speed. The turbines operate on a variable pitch principal in which the rotor blades rotate to keep them at the optimum angle to maximize output for all wind speeds. At speeds exceeding 25 m/s, the blades feather (rotate slightly on their axis) and the rotor stops turning. The turbines are equipped with a wind vane that signals wind direction changes to the electronic controller. Within the electronic controller, there is a yaw mechanism, which uses electrical motors to turn the nacelle and rotor so that the turbine faces into the wind.

 Towers: Turbines will be approximately 165 feet tall at the turbine hub, and with the nacelle and blades mounted, the total height of the wind turbine will be approximately 242 feet tall including the turbine blades. The towers will be smooth, hollow steel structures, approximately 14 feet in diameter at the base and weighing approximately 48 tons each. A controller cabinet will be located at the base inside each tower. Cables and a ladder will ascend to the nacelle to provide access for turbine maintenance. A locked door will provide access to the base of the tower. Tower foundations will be spread footing or pier-type footings.

 Exhibit B-4

 EXPANSION PROJECT

 The Expansion Project Turbines will consist of approximately 127 Vestas V-47-660-kW wind turbines located in Umatilla County, Oregon and approximately 85 Vestas V-47-660-kW wind turbines located in Walla Walla County, Washington. The Turbines otherwise have the characteristics described in Exhibit B-3. The Expansion Project is shown on the map attached as Exhibit B-2.

 Exhibit C

 EXAMPLES

 1. Calculation of Standard Deviation (Definitions, Standard Deviation)

 The Standard Deviation measures the variability of the differences in hourly Storage Energy, when compared with the hourly Storage Energy two hours before, around the mean of such differences. The following example shows the calculation for the month of January 2003 based on theoretical hourly Storage Energy amounts. This is a simplified example; a full example showing all hours in the month is attached at the end of this Exhibit.

 Number of hours in January 2003: 744 Integration Amount: 150 MW Hourly Storage Energy in MWh

 Hour in Storage Energy Gj - Gj-2 Gj - Gj-2 - Mean D2 Month Gj MWh = D MWh

 Hour 1 72.425

 Hour 2 144.761

 Hour 3 128.210 55.785 55.785 - (55.785 - ( -0.259) ( -0.259))2

 Hour 4 142.613 (2.148) (2.148) - ((2.148) - ( -0.259) ( -0.259))2

 Hour 5 133.622 5.412 5.412 - ( -0.259) (5.412 - ( -0.259))2

 Hour 6 133.780 (8.833) (8.833) - (8.833 - ( -0.259) ( -0.259))2

 Hour 7 138.229 4.607 4.607 - ( -0.259) (4.607 - ( -0.259))2

 Hour 8 132.700 (1.080) (1.080) - ((1.080) - ( -0.259) ( -0.259))2

 Hour 9 98.995 (39.234) (39.234) - (39.234 - ( -0.259) ( -0.259))2

 Hour 10 68.147 (64.553) (64.553) - (64.553 - ( -0.259) ( -0.259))2

 . . . . .

 . . . . .

 . . . . .

 Hour 742 62.328 0.012 0.012- ( -0.259) (0.012 - ( -0.259))2

 Hour 743 90.189 7.861 7.861 - ( -0.259) (7.861 - ( -0.259))2

 Hour 744 100.690 38.362 38.362 - (38.362 - ( -0.259) ( -0.259))2

 Sum = 44,956.367 Sum = (192.088) Sum = 821,283.664 MWh MWh MWh

 Mean = 821,283.664/ (192.088)/(744-2) (742-1) = 1108.345 = (0.259) MW MW

 Square root of 1108.345 = 33.292 MW

 As the example above indicates, the calculation of the standard deviation requires the following steps:

 * Measurement of hourly Storage Energy in MWh: columns 1 and 2 in table above

 * Calculation of the difference between the Storage Energy in one hour versus the Storage Energy during the hourly period two hours prior: column 3 in table above

 * Calculation of the mean of such differences, identified in the last row of column 3 in the table above. In this example, the mean of the differences equals -0.259 MW. The sum of the differences is divided by 742 hours (instead of 744) because the differences are only computed within the month, which means that the first two hours of the month are not compared with the two hours prior, which are in the previous month. Therefore, the comparisons involve hours three to the end of the month and there are (n - 2) observations.

 * Calculation of the differences between the differences in hourly Storage Energy (measured over the hourly Storage Energy two hour prior) and the mean of such differences: column 4 in table above, identified as D

 * Computation of the squares of the differences computed in the previous step, or D2: column 5 in table above

 * Addition of all the squares of the differences computed in step above. In this example, this total equals 821,283.664 MWh.

 * Division of the sum above by the number of observations (742) minus 1, that is, division of 821,283.664 by 741, which equals 1,108.345 MW, as shown in the second to last row in column 5 in the table above

 * Finally, calculation of the square root of the number computed in the previous step, which in this example results in 33.292 MW, as shown in the last row of column 5 in the table above. This number is the Standard Deviation.

 2. Calculation of charges pursuant to Section 6.1 and Section 6.2

 Assumptions:

 Integration Amount: 150 MW Transmission losses: 4.48%

 Generation Month: January 2003, with hourly Storage Energy as in the example attached at the end of this exhibit.

 Heavy Load Hours in January 2003: 416 Light Load Hours in January 2003: 328 Heavy Load Hours in March 2003: 416 Heavy Load Hours in March 2003: 328

 On Peak: 21,365.119 MWh x (1 - 0.0448) = 20,407.962 MWh Off Peak: 23,817.15 MWh x (1 - 0.0448) = 22,750.142 MWh Total Scheduled Energy: 20,407.963 + 22,750.142 = 43,158.105 MWh

 PacifiCorp's Applicable Charges: Capacity Charge: $1.075/kW month Energy Charge: $2.65/MWh

 Variability Charge: $5,650 per 1,000 kilowatts of Standard Deviation per month

 Total Energy Returned in Return Month (March 2003) On Peak 20,407.962 MWh /416 hours = 49 MW delivered over On Peak Hours in March, or On Peak Scheduled Energy: 49 MW x 416 hours = 20,384 MWh

 Energy transferred to February 2003 Storage Energy and to be delivered as Return Energy in April 2003: 20,407.962 - 20,384 = 23.962 MWh

 Off Peak

 22,750.142 MWh /328 hours = 69 MW delivered over Off Peak Hours in March, or Off Peak Scheduled Energy: 69 MW x 328 hours = 22,632 MWh

 Energy transferred to February 2003 Storage Energy and to be Delivered as Return Energy in April 2003: 22,750.142 - 22,632 = 118.142 MWh

 Total Scheduled Energy in March 2003: 20,384 + 22,632 = 43,016 MWh

 Total Bill to Seattle for Scheduled Energy Returned in Return Month of March (January Generation, billed February 2003)

 Capacity Charge: 150 MW x $1,075 = $ 161,250.00

 Energy Charge: 45,182 MWh (Storage Energy) x $2.65 = $ 119,732.30

 Variability Charge: 33.459 MW x $5,650= $189,043.35

 Total Bill (issued in February 2003) = $470,025.65

Integration Service under this Agreement shall begin as of the Date of Initial Service and shall remain in full force and effect, unless terminated pursuant to Article 19, through December 31, 2021 (the "Term").

 2.2 Regulatory Matters.

 (a) Filing By PPM. PPM may file this Agreement with FERC if it determines in its sole discretion that such a filing is necessary or desirable.

 (b) Changes to Underlying Integration and Exchange Agreement. The Parties acknowledge that PacifiCorp will need to file the Underlying Integration and Exchange Agreement with FERC. If FERC issues any order other than an order that accepts the Underlying Integration and Exchange Agreement for filing in its entirety without change, the Parties shall exercise commercially reasonable efforts to amend or replace this Agreement as needed to conform with any amendment or replacement of the Underlying Integration and Exchange Agreement that is entered into to comply with the FERC order. Any such amendment or replacement of this Agreement shall provide benefits similar to those provided under this Agreement to both Parties. The Parties shall enter into any such amendment or replacement agreement effective as of the date on which the Underlying Integration and Exchange Agreement is amended or replaced; provided, however, that if the Parties are unable to agree upon an amendment or a replacement agreement, this Agreement shall terminate sixty (60) days after the date on which FERC issues its order with respect to the Underlying Integration and Exchange Agreement. The Parties may enter into a short-term interim agreement that will incorporate the terms and conditions of the Underlying Integration and Exchange Agreement.

 2.3 Termination and Suspension of Power Purchase Agreement. PPM acknowledges that this Agreement is based on City Light's purchase of energy and Environmental Attributes under the Power Purchase Agreement. Thus, to the extent that the Power Purchase Agreement terminates for a reason other than City Light's default under the Power Purchase Agreement, City Light reserves the right to immediately terminate this Agreement.

 2.4 Revised Charges; Termination of Integration Services due to an Operational RTO. PPM acknowledges that after the RTO Effective Date, PacifiCorp will propose revised Variability Charges, Integration Charges and the mechanism by which PacifiCorp will account for transmission losses affecting Storage Energy (collectively, "Revised Charges") pursuant to the Underlying Integration and Exchange Agreement. No later than five (5) days after City Light receives the Revised Charges from PacifiCorp, City Light will inform PPM of the Revised Charges together with any commercially reasonable, good faith revisions to the Operating Reserves Charge, Administrative Charge and other miscellaneous charges. City Light and PPM will work to identify the least cost commercially available alternative to PacifiCorp's Revised Charges that will provide services most like the Underlying Integration and Exchange Agreement. If the Parties do not agree on whether to accept or reject the Revised Charges no later than thirty-five (35) days after the date on which City Light receives PacifiCorp's notice of Revised Charges and the Parties have not previously agreed to a commercially available alternative including City Light negotiating with PacifiCorp for a reduction in the Integration Amount, this Agreement shall terminate ninety (90) days after the date on which City Light receives PacifiCorp's notice of the Revised Charges, provided, however, either Party's request for termination may not cause the other Party financial harm. Otherwise, this Agreement shall continue through the remainder of the Term using the Revised Charges.

 2.5 Network Generation Resource.

 (a) Inability to Maintain Storage Energy as a Network Generation Resource. The Parties understand that PacifiCorp has determined that it is able to add the Storage Energy as a network generation resource to the network transmission service agreement between PacifiCorp and PacifiCorp Transmission. However, if PacifiCorp receives notice from PacifiCorp Transmission in the future that PacifiCorp will be unable to maintain Storage Energy as a network generation resource despite PacifiCorp's commercially reasonable efforts, the Parties to this Agreement shall negotiate in good faith concerning a possible replacement arrangement that would provide comparable benefits and burdens for each Party as are provided in this Agreement based on either (i) the replacement arrangements agreed to between City Light and PacifiCorp; or (ii) any other reasonable integration and exchange alternative. City Light shall promptly notify PPM if PacifiCorp determines that it will be unable to maintain Storage Energy as a network generation resource. If the Parties are unable to agree to an alternative replacement arrangement within forty-five (45) days after the date of PacifiCorp's notice to City Light, either Party may terminate this Agreement upon forty-five (45) days written notice, provided, however, the Party requesting termination may not cause the non- requesting Party financial harm.

 (b) Additional Expense for Adding Storage Energy as a Network Generation Resource. In the event that PacifiCorp gives City Light notice of PacifiCorp's receipt of an invoice or other notice from PacifiCorp Transmission seeking to impose additional costs on PacifiCorp after the date on which the Underlying Integration and Exchange Agreement is entered into because PacifiCorp has designated the Storage Energy as a network generation resource, PPM agrees to pay (without waiving either Party's ability to challenge the appropriateness of such costs in a complaint before FERC or otherwise), PPM's Percentage Share multiplied by the additional expense amount billed to City Light. If such additional costs are on-going, by five (5) days written notice to PPM, City Light may elect to suspend its duty to accept Storage Energy under this Agreement pending resolution of the issues of whether the additional costs are reasonable and the proper allocation of such additional costs between City Light and PacifiCorp under the Underlying Integration and Exchange Agreement. City Light acknowledges that PPM, as payer of a share of any such additional costs, will be harmed by any inappropriately imposed additional costs. Therefore, if requested by PPM, City Light shall make such assignment of any arrangements they may have as are required for PPM to challenge such additional costs in a complaint proceeding, or for PPM to intervene in and protest any filing with the FERC by PacifiCorp Transmission for recovery of such additional costs. If the parties to this Agreement are unable to agree with PacifiCorp upon the proper amount or allocation of such additional costs between the Parties and PacifiCorp, either Party may terminate this Agreement by giving forty-five (45) days prior notice to the other Party, provided, however, the Party requesting termination may not cause the non-requesting Party financial harm. If this Agreement is terminated pursuant to this Section 2.5(b), PPM agrees to pay PPM's Percentage Share of the costs imposed and incurred by PacifiCorp Transmission and assigned to City Light through the Underlying Integration and Exchange Agreement.

 2.6 Effect of Termination. If this Agreement terminates for any reason, the provisions of this Agreement shall remain in effect after any termination of the Agreement to the extent necessary to satisfy the terms and conditions of this Agreement (including the delivery of any Scheduled Energy that City Light is required to deliver with respect to Storage Energy delivered before the termination date) and to provide for final billings and adjustments related to (a) the period before termination, (b) the delivery of Scheduled Energy, and (c) payment of any money due and owing either Party pursuant to this Agreement, provided, however, in the event of a termination of this Agreement for a reason other than City Light's default, City Light may require PPM to assign to City Light all or a portion of its available Seller Transmission Rights (as defined in the Power Purchase Agreement) as provided in Section 5.3.2 of the Power Purchase Agreement.

 2.7 Termination of Underlying Integration and Exchange Agreement.

 (a) Promptly after receiving a notice that the Underlying Integration and Exchange Agreement will terminate, the Parties shall meet to discuss whether either or both wish to continue with integration and exchange services consistent with those contemplated by the Underlying Integration and Exchange Agreement and/or the PPM Integration and Exchange Agreement or to consider alternatives to such integration and exchange services. If PPM does not wish to continue such services or an alternative to such integration and exchange services, this Agreement shall terminate on the date on which the Underlying Integration and Exchange Agreement terminates.

 (b) If the Underlying Integration and Exchange Agreement will terminate and PPM wishes to continue with integration and exchange services and/or transmission services that produce benefits substantially similar to the Underlying Integration and Exchange Agreement and this Agreement, both Parties shall use good faith, commercially reasonable efforts to identify alternative arrangements for transmitting, integrating, and/or exchanging Storage Energy from the Delivery Point to Mid-Columbia or another mutually agreed point, including arrangements in which City Light performs the integration and exchange services contemplated by this Agreement (an "Alternative Integration and Exchange/Transmission Arrangement"). The Parties shall consider only Alternative Integration and Exchange/Transmission Arrangements that are commercially reasonable and do not unfairly allocate the burdens or benefits of the arrangement to one Party. If PPM elects to enter into one or some combination of the Alternative Integration and Exchange/Transmission Arrangements, the Parties shall amend this Agreement to the extent reasonably necessary to account for the arrangements that PPM will enter into. If PPM declines to enter into an Alternative Integration and Exchange/Transmission Arrangement, City Light's performance under this Agreement shall be suspended until such time as PPM accepts and enters into an Alternative Integration and Exchange/Transmission Arrangement. In such case, the Parties shall from time to time cooperate in the effort to identify Alternative Integration and Exchange/Transmission Arrangements acceptable to PPM, but City Light shall not be obligated to meet with PPM more than once per year for that purpose.

 (c) Notwithstanding the foregoing, City Light shall be responsible for its default under the Underlying Integration and Exchange Agreement to the extent such default is not caused by PPM's acts or omissions under this Agreement or the Power Purchase Agreement. If the Underlying Integration and Exchange Agreement is terminated because of City Light's default, City Light shall continue to be liable for the performance of this Agreement in accordance with its terms.

 Article 3: Integration and Exchange Service

 3.1 Delivery of Storage Energy. PPM shall deliver to City Light or its designee (as named in a notice given to PPM by City Light), and City Light shall accept or use commercially reasonable efforts to cause such designee to accept, all energy attributable to PPM's Integration Amount at the Point of Receipt. The Parties acknowledge that, on an instantaneous basis, the amount of Storage Energy delivered is the total energy actually delivered to the Point of Metering multiplied by the Delivery Percentage. Except to the extent that Storage Energy varies because of wind conditions or as otherwise provided in Section 3.3 or Article 18 of this Agreement or in Section 5.3.4(b) of the Power Purchase Agreement, PPM shall take no action, contractual or otherwise, to reduce the amount of energy attributable to the Integration Amount and delivered to City Light or its designee at the Point of Receipt.

 3.2 Additional Energy. If the Additional Energy (as defined in the Power Purchase Agreement) comes from the State Line Wind Project, City Light will attempt to enter into a binding, commercially reasonable arrangement for integration and exchange service for the Additional Energy. The Parties shall negotiate in good faith to make such changes to this Agreement as may be reasonably necessary to incorporate the increased integration amount into the definition of PPM's Integration Amount under this Agreement.

 3.3 Minimum Walla Walla Load.

 (a) Notice of Walla Walla Load Decreases. The Parties acknowledge that, pursuant to the Underlying Integration and Exchange Agreement, PacifiCorp is required to forecast the Walla Walla Load in accordance with Prudent Industry Practices. If the Walla Walla Load is expected to fall (or does in fact fall) below the Integration Amount in any hour, City Light shall provide PPM with at least twenty (20) days advance notice of the timing and amount of the expected reduction in the Walla Walla Load; provided, however, that if the Walla Walla Load falls (or is expected to fall) below the Integration Amount in any hour because of an event not anticipated by PacifiCorp in forecasting conducted in accordance with Prudent Industry Practices and City Light is therefore unable to give PPM at least twenty (20) days advance notice of the Walla Walla Load reduction, City Light shall provide as much advance notice of the Walla Walla Load reduction to PPM as is reasonably possible in the circumstances (but in no event less than sixty [60] minutes before the hour of delivery).

 (b) PPM's Options in the Event of Walla Walla Load Decreases. By notice given to City Light five (5) days after PPM's receipt of a notice of an anticipated Walla Walla Load decrease (or by telephonic notice given within such shorter period as may be available before the hour of delivery), PPM may elect one or any combination of the following options:

 (1) to reduce PPM's Integration Amount so that the Integration Amount is less than the projected minimum Walla Walla Load;

 (2) to provide City Light, at PPM's expense, with firm point- to-point transmission rights for PPM's Integration Amount from the Walla Walla 230 kV bus to the Wanapum generation bus in an amount equal to the amount by which PacifiCorp's Walla Walla Load falls (or is expected to fall) below the Integration Amount (but not to exceed PPM's Integration Amount); or

 (3) subject to (z) below, if PPM is unable to obtain such firm point-to-point transmission rights despite its reasonably diligent efforts to do so, PPM may provide City Light, at PPM's expense, with non-firm point-to-point transmission rights for PPM's Integration Amount from the Walla Walla 230 kV bus to the Wanapum generation bus until such time as PPM is able, using reasonably diligent efforts, to obtain such firm point-to-point transmission rights; provided, however,

 (x) if City Light gives notice within one (1) week before the actual hour of delivery, it shall do so by telephoning the party or parties designated by PPM in writing for that purpose, which party or parties shall be deemed authorized to elect option (1), (2), or (3) above on behalf of PPM;

 (y) if PPM or the party or parties designated by PPM elect option (3) above and transmission ceases to be available under such non-firm transmission rights, PPM shall immediately reduce the Integration Amount so that it is less than the Walla Walla Load; and

 (z) if the Walla Walla Load falls (or is expected to fall) below the Integration Amount for the reasonably foreseeable future, PPM shall be required to choose between option (1) or option (2) to ensure that City Light's Integration Amount is able to reach the Mid-Columbia.

 PPM shall implement option (1), (2) or (3), as applicable, for the amount and duration of the period in which the Walla Walla Load is expected to be below the Integration Amount and sufficiently in advance of that period to allow PacifiCorp to plan for the use of and pre-schedule any such firm transmission rights pursuant to Prudent Industry Practices and the requirements of PacifiCorp Transmission or the Operational RTO, as the case may be.

 (c) Walla Walla Load Increases. In the event PacifiCorp's projected minimum Walla Walla Load subsequently increases so as to allow PacifiCorp to accept an increased amount of Storage Energy under the Underlying Integration and Exchange Agreement, on an instantaneous basis, up to the Integration Amount before such reduction, City Light shall promptly notify PPM of the additional amount that PacifiCorp is able to accept. PPM shall promptly respond in writing as to PPM's desire to have City Light integrate an incremental amount of energy, not to exceed the amount specified in PacifiCorp's notice.

 3.4 Environmental Attributes. City Light shall not market or resell any Environmental Attributes associated with Storage Energy. As between City Light and PPM, PPM shall retain the exclusive right to all Environmental Attributes associated with the Storage Energy.

 3.5 Integration and Exchange Delivery. PPM shall deliver Storage Energy to City Light or its designee at the Point of Receipt. Pursuant to the Underlying Integration and Exchange Agreement, City Light shall, or shall use commercially reasonable efforts to cause its designee to:

 (a) store such Storage Energy during each Generation Month during the Term until such time as Scheduled Energy is scheduled pursuant to Article 5 of this Agreement; and

 (b) maintain separate accounts of Off Peak Storage Energy and On Peak Storage Energy delivered during each Generation Month; and,

 (c) deliver Scheduled Energy beginning on the first day of the Return Month that is two months following the Date of Initial Service and continuing through the Term. For example, if the Date of Initial Service is January 28, 2002 Storage Energy associated with the Generation Month of January 2002 shall be scheduled for the benefit of PPM as Scheduled Energy during the Return Month of March 2002.

 In addition, City Light shall provide PacifiCorp, on behalf of PPM with Operating Reserves equal to ten percent (10%) of PPM's Integration Amount.

 Throughout the Term of this Agreement, if PPM is unable or unwilling to receive Scheduled Energy at the Point of Delivery or a mutually agreed alternative delivery point, PPM shall be responsible for imbalance charges, administrative costs and any other damages suffered by City Light (acting in a good faith, commercially reasonable manner) caused by PPM's inability or unwillingness to receive Scheduled Energy. In such an event, PPM shall be responsible for the full amount of any bill due and payable under Article 7 of this Agreement.

 3.6 Losses Between Point of Metering and Point of Receipt. The losses between the Point of Metering and the Point of Receipt shall be zero percent (0%) for the purposes of this Agreement. If the calculated losses associated with the physical electrical path from the Point of Metering to the Point of Receipt changes after the date on which this Agreement is executed, either Party may request a new value for this loss percentage by giving written notice to the other Party describing in reasonable detail the basis of the proposed change in the loss percentage. The proposed loss percentage will be subject to the other Party's consent, which the other Party shall not unreasonably withhold, condition or delay. The new loss percentage will apply prospectively from the date of the written notice.

 3.7 Measurement and Metering. Readings of the meter recognized

 by PacifiCorp Transmission at the Point of Metering shall be conclusive as to the amount of Storage Energy delivered under this Agreement; provided, however, that if any such meter is out of service or is determined to be registering inaccurately, measurement of Storage Energy delivered under this Agreement shall be determined in the following sequence:

 (a) by Check Meters, if they have been installed and are operational; or

 (b) by using the hourly integrated instantaneous MW value used to monitor the composite turbine output from the computer monitoring system (i) to compare to the hourly meter reading of the project developer's meters to determine the beginning of the deviation event and (ii) by using the integrated instantaneous MW value from beginning of the deviation event to the time when the meter was back in-service or repaired to estimate Storage Energy delivered; or

 (c) by the computer monitoring system for each turbine, using a mathematical calculation developed pursuant to the Power Purchase Agreement to adjust the output thereof to account for electrical losses in the gathering system and turbine transformers and substation transformers up to the Point of Receipt; or

 (d) by estimating the unmeasured or inaccurately measured quantities by referring to the measurements made during other comparable time periods having similar conditions when the project developer's meters were registering accurately, or

 (e) if no reliable information exists as to the period over which the meter at the Point of Metering was registering inaccurately, by assuming for correction purposes under this Agreement that such inaccuracy was equal to (i) if the period of inaccuracy can be determined, the actual period during which inaccurate measurements were made; or (ii) if the period of inaccuracy cannot be determined, one-half of the period from the date of the last previous test of such meter through the date of the adjustments, provided, however, that, in the case of clause (ii), the period covered by the correction shall not exceed six months.

 To the extent that the adjustment period covers a period of deliveries for which payment has already been made by PPM under this Agreement, the difference between the original bills paid and the recomputed bills, based on adjusted metering information, shall be paid to the Party entitled to receive such amount not later than thirty (30) days after the owing Party receives notice of the amount due. Adjustment schedules for prior deliveries of On-Peak Scheduled Energy and/or Off-Peak Scheduled Energy, due to inaccurate metering, shall be arranged as soon as possible between the Parties' schedulers; provided, however, that such adjustment schedules shall be arranged not later than one hundred eighty (180) days after the Party owing such energy receives notice of the energy amount owed. For example, if it is determined that less energy was generated than was stored as Storage Energy, then the Parties shall reduce the amount of Scheduled Energy appropriately. Likewise, if it is determined that more energy was generated than stored as Storage Energy, then the Parties shall increase the amount of Scheduled Energy appropriately.

 Article 4: Point of Receipt, Point of Delivery

 4.1 Point of Receipt. The Point of Receipt for On-Peak Storage Energy and Off-Peak Storage Energy shall be at the 230 kV level of PacifiCorp's Wallula substation in Walla Walla County, Washington, as shown on the one-line diagram attached as Exhibit A. If the Underlying Integration and Exchange Agreement terminates, City Light may change the Point of Receipt for On-Peak Storage Energy and Off-Peak Storage Energy (subject to PPM's prior consent, which PPM may not unreasonably withhold, condition or delay).

 4.2 Point of Delivery. The Point of Delivery for Scheduled Energy and for the return of energy from Operating Reserves shall be Mid-Columbia or as mutually agreed by the Parties schedulers and dispatchers.

 Article 5: Scheduling

 5.1 Scheduled Energy Scheduling. During each Return Month, the Parties shall pre-schedule On-Peak Scheduled Energy and Off-Peak Scheduled Energy by 1000 hours Pacific Prevailing Time on the mutually recognized pre-scheduling day before the day(s) of delivery, for delivery at the Point of Delivery. The hourly rate of delivery shall be determined by taking the total megawatt-hours contained in the On-Peak Storage Energy account or Off-Peak Storage Energy account, as applicable, accrued during the Generation Month (after adjustment for losses pursuant to the definition of Scheduled Energy), and then dividing by the number of On-Peak hours, or Off-Peak hours as the case may be, in the Return Month. An example showing how the hourly rate of delivery would be determined in certain stated circumstances is attached as Exhibit C. The rate of delivery shall be rounded down to the nearest whole megawatt with any remaining amounts as a result of rounding to be held in the applicable Storage Energy account until the next Return Month. Notwithstanding the above provisions, the Parties' schedulers may mutually agree upon different delivery hours, delivery points or rates of delivery as necessary to fulfill the total monthly obligations of both Parties.

 5.2 Records of Deliveries. All deliveries under this Agreement shall be deemed to be made during the hours and in the amounts as accounted for in City Light's records and the records of City Light's designee; provided, however, if deliveries of Scheduled Energy are interrupted pursuant to a Transmission Constraint or pursuant to Article 18 (Force Majeure), such schedules shall be adjusted to reflect the interruption. The Parties shall mutually agree to schedule any undelivered On-Peak Scheduled Energy or Off- Peak Scheduled Energy during subsequent On-Peak or Off-Peak hours and at increased rates of delivery; provided further, if mutual agreement is not reached, City Light shall use commercially reasonable efforts pursuant to the Underlying Integration and Exchange Agreement to cause its designee to schedule additional amounts evenly during applicable On-Peak or Off-Peak hours similar to the On-Peak or Off-Peak hours during which the curtailing event occurred and as necessary to schedule such undelivered amounts of energy to City Light within four weeks following the curtailing event.

 5.3 Balancing. Attached Exhibit E sets forth the procedures by which the Parties have agreed to balance deliveries of Energy from the Project.

 Article 6: Integration, Variability and Other Charges

 6.3 Miscellaneous Charges.

 (a) Operating Reserves Charge. PPM shall pay City Light, pursuant to the provisions of Article 7,for (i) the Operating Reserves that City Light will provide to its designee with respect to PPM's Integration Amount, at a rate of $3.00 per MW per hour for 10% of PPM's Integration Amount (the result of multiplying 10% by PPM's Integration Amount must be rounded to the next highest even number of MW), plus, (ii) the transmission that City Light

 will provide with respect to the Operating Reserves, an amount equal to the then current BPA Open Access Transmission Tariff, Point-To-Point Firm Transmission Rate Schedule for 10% of PPM's Integration Amount, plus (iii) Value of Losses. These charges may be revised pursuant Section 2.4

 (b) Transmission Transfer Charge. PPM shall pay City Light, pursuant to the provisions of Article 7, any transmission transfer charges or other like charges incurred by City Light to deliver Scheduled Energy to PPM's Point of Delivery. Currently, this amount is anticipated to be $0. The Parties shall cooperate in good faith to minimize any transmission transfer charge.

 6.4 Administrative Charge. PPM shall pay to City Light an Administrative Charge of One Thousand Dollars ($1000.00) per month subject to revision pursuant to Section 2.4.

 6.5 Pricing Revisions. The pricing contained in this Article 6 shall remain in effect through the term of the Underlying Integration and Exchange Agreement, provided, however, if Revised Charges take effect, then the Revised Charges shall then apply through the term of the Underlying Integration and Exchange Agreement. After the Underlying Integration and Exchange Agreement terminates, City Light shall provide PPM with new charges for the integration and exchange service determined by City Light in its reasonable discretion before the termination of the Underlying Shaping Agreement (subject to PPM's approval, which PPM shall not unreasonably withhold, condition or delay). Neither Party shall petition the FERC pursuant to the provisions of Section 205 or 206 of the Federal Power Act to amend such prices absent the agreement in writing of the other Party.

 6.6 Example. An example illustrating the calculation of the Invoice for the Integration Charge, the Variability Charge, the Miscellaneous Charge and the Administrative Charge for a given calendar month, under certain stated assumptions, is set forth on Exhibit C.

 Article 7: Billing and Payment

 7.1 Monthly Billings. No later than the 20th day of each month following a Generation Month, City Light shall bill PPM for charges applicable to the Generation Month in accordance with Article 6. City Light shall transmit the bill to PPM by fax. The total monthly charges shall be determined as follows:

 (a) Integration Charge. From Section 6.1, PPM's Integration Charge shall equal PPM's Percentage Share in the Generation Month multiplied by the Integration Charge (Capacity Charge plus the Energy Charge) billed to City Light under the Underlying Integration and Exchange Agreement.

 (b) Variability Charge. From Section 6.2, PPM's Variability Charge shall equal PPM's Percentage Share in the Generation Month multiplied by the Variability Charge billed to City Light under the Underlying Integration and Exchange Agreement.

 (c) Miscellaneous Charges.

 (i) Operating Reserves. From Section 6.3, the Operating Reserve Charge shall equal (v) 10%, multiplied by PPM's Integration Amount (in MW) in the Generation Month, rounded to the next highest even number, multiplied by (w) $3 per MW, multiplied by (x) the number of hours in the Generation Month, plus (y) transmission calculated according to BPA's then current PTP Firm Transmission Rates for 10% of PPM's Integration Amount, plus (z) the Value of Losses.

 (ii) Transmission Transfer Charges. From Section 6.3, all transmission transfer charges or other like charges incurred by City Light to deliver Scheduled Energy to PPM's Point of Delivery.

 (d) Administrative Charge. The administrative charge is $1,000 per month.

 City Light shall include in each faxed bill sufficient detail to allow PPM to verify the billing. An example illustrating the calculation of this billing under certain stated assumptions is attached as Exhibit C.

 7.2 Payments to City Light. PPM shall pay all amounts due City Light by electronic wire transfer by the later of ten (10) days after receipt of the bill or the twenty-fifth (25th) of the month in accordance with written wire transfer instructions given by City Light to PPM from time to time; provided, however, that any changes to such wire transfer instructions shall not be effective until two (2) Business Days after the date on which notice of the change is sent to PPM. If the due date is not a Business Day, Purchaser shall pay the monthly bill on the Business Day following such due date. Payment for all services initially provided under this Agreement are to be electronically wire transferred to Wells Fargo Bank, ABA No. 121000248, Account No. 4758359921 for the benefit of Seattle City Light.

 7.3 Interest on Unpaid Amounts. In the event either Party has not paid the full amount due on or before close of business on the due date, the owing Party shall pay interest on the unpaid amount for each day it is late at a rate equal to (a) the Prime Rate plus 200 basis points, divided by (b) 360, or the rate allowed by law, whichever is less.

 7.4 Credit Support.

 (a) Demand. During the Term, if a Material Adverse Change affects PPM's Affiliate or City Light, the other Party, in its discretion, may require the Party experiencing or affected by the Material Adverse Change to provide Credit Support sufficient to assure that the Party experiencing or affected by the Material Adverse Change will continue to meet its current contractual obligations under this Agreement and its contractual obligations for the next twelve (12) Months from the date of demand for Credit Support (or if the remaining Term of this Agreement is less than twelve (12) Months, for the remaining Term of this Agreement). PPM may provide such Credit Support either directly or through PPM's Affiliate.

 (b) Maintenance of Credit Support. Following a demand for Credit Support and until such time as the Party or PPM's Affiliate is no longer experiencing or affected by a Material Adverse Change,

 the Party experiencing or affected by the Material Adverse Change shall maintain satisfactory Credit Support on an ongoing, rolling basis sufficient to assure its current contractual obligations and its contractual obligations for the following twelve (12) calendar months. At the request of either Party, Credit Support shall be increased or decreased as appropriate once per calendar month such that the Party providing Credit Support will be able to meet the affected Party's then-current contractual obligations and its contractual obligations under this Agreement for the next twelve (12) calendar month period (or if the remaining Term of this Agreement is less than twelve (12) calendar months, for the remaining Term of this Agreement).

 (c) City Light's Credit Support. If City Light is experiencing a Material Adverse Change, City Light's Credit Support for the above period shall be in an amount sufficient to provide replacement integration services that would be delivered for the above referenced twelve (12) Month period under this Agreement.

 (d) PPM's Affiliate Credit Support. If PPM's Affiliate is experiencing a Material Adverse Change, PPM's Affiliate's Credit Support for the above period shall be in an amount sufficient to cover anticipated receivables for the above referenced twelve (12) Month period under this Agreement.

 (e) Failure to Provide or Maintain Credit Support. If the Party experiencing a Material Adverse Change fails to provide required Credit Support within ten (10) Days of the request for Credit Support or fails to maintain Credit Support as provided above, the requesting Party may suspend its performance under this Agreement until the required Credit Support is posted or may treat the failure to provide Credit Support as a default and exercise its rights under Article 19 of this Agreement.

 7.5 Financial Information. At a Party's written request, the other Party shall furnish the requesting Party financial information as may be reasonably required to confirm that City Light or PPM's Affiliate has not been affected by a Material Adverse Change. Either Party may assign its Credit Support obligation to a guarantor that will be able to meet the minimum credit standards set forth in the definition of Material Adverse Change.

 7.6 Assignment of Credit Support Obligation. Either party may assign its Credit support obligation to a guarantor that will be able to meet the minimum credit standards set forth in the definition of Material Adverse Change.

 Article 8: Audit Rights; Disputes

 8.1 Audit Rights; Maintenance of Records. Each Party shall have the right, upon reasonable notice to the other Party and during regular business hours, to access all of the other Party's metering records, accounting records and supporting documents of any billing or delivery of energy associated with this Agreement. Each Party shall keep complete and accurate records, and shall maintain such records as may be necessary for the purpose of ascertaining the accuracy of all relevant data, estimates, statements of charges or invoices until the later of (a) two (2) years from the date of that invoice, or (b) if there is a dispute relating to that invoice, the date on which the dispute is resolved. Each Party shall bear the costs of its own audit; provided, however, that the other Party agrees to cooperate with the audit and shall not charge for any reasonable costs (including without limitation the cost of photocopies) that the other Party may incur as a result of such  audit. Should the audit discover an over-billing error or errors, City Light shall compensate PPM the amount of the error plus interest at the rate specified in Section 7.3. Such interest will accrue from the date on which PPM paid the overbilled amount to City Light. Should the audit discover an under-billing error or errors, PPM shall compensate City Light the amount of the error plus interest at the rate specified in Section 7.3. Such interest will accrue from the date on which PPM should have paid the under- billed amount to City Light.

 8.2 Disputed Invoices. If PPM disputes an invoice, it shall give City Light a reasonably detailed notice of any alleged error explaining the basis for the alleged error. Notwithstanding any such dispute, PPM shall pay the disputed amount when due. If City Light notifies PPM in writing within thirty (30) Days of receipt of such notice that City Light disagrees with the allegation of error, the Parties shall meet, by telephone conference call or otherwise, within five (5) Business Days of City Light's response for the purpose of attempting to resolve the dispute. If the Parties are unable to resolve the dispute within thirty (30) Days after their initial meeting, either Party may proceed to seek whatever remedy may be available to that Party at law or in equity. If City Light is found to be in error, City Light will refund to PPM the amount that PPM paid in excess of the amount that PPM actually owed pursuant to Section 7.1 above, plus interest on such excess payment at the rate specified in Section 7.3. Such interest will accrue from the later of (a) the date on which PPM paid the disputed amount to City Light, or (b) the date on which PPM gives City Light notice of the dispute, until the date on which City Light receives payment in full of the amount owed to it.

 8.3 Corrected Invoices. If City Light identifies an error in an invoice, it shall promptly give PPM a reasonably detailed notice describing the nature and effect of the error. If PPM notifies City Light in writing within thirty (30) Days of receipt of such notice that PPM disagrees with the allegation of an error, the Parties shall meet, by telephone conference call or otherwise, within five (5) Business Days of PPM's response for the purpose of attempting to resolve the dispute. If the Parties are unable to resolve the dispute within thirty (30) Days after their initial meeting, either Party may proceed to seek whatever remedy may be available to that Party at law or in equity. If the error requires City Light to reimburse PPM for amounts previously paid by PPM, City Light shall promptly reimburse PPM for such amounts or credit PPM for such amounts in the next invoice to PPM invoice plus interest on such amount at the rate specified in Section 7.3. Such interest will accrue from the date on which PPM paid the disputed amount to City Light. If the error requires PPM to pay City Light additional amounts, City Light shall add the amount owed to a subsequent invoice plus interest on such amount at the rate specified in Section 7.3. Such interest will accrue from the later of (a) the date on which City Light payment was due, or (b) the date on which PacifiCorp gives City Light notice of the dispute. To the extent either Party identifies an invoice error that impacts the previous delivery of Scheduled Energy, adjustment schedules for prior deliveries of On-Peak Scheduled Energy and/or Off-Peak Scheduled Energy, due to an inaccurate invoice, shall be arranged as soon as possible between the Parties' schedulers; provided, however, that such adjustment schedules shall be arranged not later than one hundred eighty (180) days after the Parties determine that such energy is owed pursuant to the provisions of this Section 8.3. For example, if it is determined that less Scheduled Energy was delivered to PPM than appropriate, then the Parties shall increase the amount of future Scheduled Energy appropriately. Likewise, if it is determined that more Scheduled Energy was delivered to PPM than appropriate, then the Parties shall decrease the amount of future Scheduled Energy appropriately.

 8.4 Time Limits on Disputes and Corrections. Until the second anniversary of the date on which PPM receives an invoice, (a) PPM may dispute the invoice under Section 8.2, and (b) City Light may give PPM a notice correcting the invoice under Section 8.3. An invoice that has not been disputed under Section 8.2 or noticed for correction under Section 8.3 before such second anniversary shall be conclusive, final and no longer subject to adjustment.

 Article 9: Assignment

 9.1 General Rule. Neither Party may assign its rights or delegate its duties under this Agreement without the consent of the other Party, which the other Party shall not unreasonably withhold, condition or delay. The assigning Party will remain liable under the Agreement. Any assignment in breach of this Article 9 shall be void.

 9.2 Exception to Consent Requirement. The consent of the non- assigning Party shall not be required if, and only if, the assigning Party assigns its full rights and delegates all of its duties under this Agreement to (a) a party that purchases all or substantially all of that Party's assets, (b) the survivor of a merger of the assigning Party with another person, or (c) a third party controlled by or under common control with the assigning Party. City Light's consent shall not be required in connection with the sale or other transfer of stock of PPM or any Affiliate of PPM.

 Article 10: Liability; No Dedication

 10.1 No Consequential Damages. NEITHER PARTY SHALL BE LIABLE FOR SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, EXEMPLARY, INDIRECT, PUNITIVE, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, WHETHER BASED ON CONTRACT OR TORT (INCLUDING SUCH PARTY'S OWN NEGLIGENCE) AND INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, LOSS OF PROFITS OR REVENUE, LOSS OF USE OF THE EQUIPMENT OR ANY ASSOCIATED EQUIPMENT, COST OF CAPITAL, COST OF SUBSTITUTE EQUIPMENT, FACILITIES OR SERVICES, DOWNTIME COSTS, OR CLAIMS OF CUSTOMERS OF CITY LIGHT OR OF PPM FOR SUCH DAMAGES.

For purposes of this Agreement, the term "Uncontrollable Forces" shall mean any act of God or any other casualty or occurrence, condition, event or circumstance of any kind or nature not reasonably within the excused Party's control (including, without limitation, acts or omissions of any utility regulatory authority or other governmental authority such as a taking by condemnation or power of eminent domain); requirement of any governmental authority; transmission outages or sudden or disruptive electrical events or disturbances; strikes; slow downs or labor difficulties (even though such difficulties could be resolved by conceding to the demands of a labor group); fires; flood; earthquakes; explosions; vehicular accidents or other hazards; acts of public enemies; riots; civil commotion; insurrection; and unavailability of supplies or delays in deliveries by suppliers, vendors or subcontractors of any Party, to the extent such suppliers, vendors or subcontractors are subject to an event of the type described in this sentence; any event considered to be a force majeure event under the Power Purchase Agreement and/or an event that is an event of Uncontrollable Forces under the Underlying Integration and Exchange Agreement; provided, however, that neither a Party's financial inability to perform any payment obligation pursuant to this Agreement nor any change in a Party's financial condition shall constitute an uncontrollable force. City Light represents and warrants to PPM that a true and correct copy of the Uncontrollable Forces provision from the Underlying Integration and Exchange Agreement is attached as Exhibit D. City Light shall not amend these provisions without PPM's prior written consent (which PPM may not unreasonably withhold, condition or delay). Nothing contained in this Article 18 shall be construed so as to require a Party to settle any strike or labor dispute in which it may be involved. Any Party rendered unable to fulfill any obligation by reason of Uncontrollable Forces shall exercise due diligence to remove such inability with all reasonable dispatch.

 Article 19: Defaults and Remedies

 19.1 Defaults. The following events shall constitute defaults under this Agreement:

 (a) Failure of a Party to perform any material duty imposed upon that Party by this Agreement, including its duty to make payment when due;

 (b) Filing of a petition in bankruptcy by or against a Party if such petition is not withdrawn or dismissed within sixty (60) days after it is filed;

 (c) Assignment by a Party for the benefit of creditors;

 (d) Allowance by a Party of the appointment of a receiver or trustee of all or any part of its property if such receiver or trustee is not discharged within sixty (60) days after such appointment;

 (e) Failure of PPM to provide credit support within ten (10) days as required by Section 7.4;

 (f) Failure of PPM to post or maintain credit support pursuant to Section 7.4;

 (g) Failure of City Light to provide credit support within ten (10) days as required by Section 7.4;

 (h) Failure of City Light to post or maintain credit support pursuant to Section 7.4.

 19.2 Notice of Default. The Party in default under this Agreement shall be referred to as the "Defaulting Party," and the other Party shall be referred to as the "Non-Defaulting Party." The Non- Defaulting Party shall have the right to give the Defaulting Party a written Notice of Default, which shall describe the default in reasonable detail and state the date by which the default must be cured.

 19.3 Opportunity to Cure. In the case of a default described in Sections 19.1 (b), (c), (d), (e) and (f) there will be no cure period and no opportunity to outside of any time period expressly stated in such section. In the case of a failure to pay money when due, the default must be cured within ten (10) days after the Defaulting Party's receipt of the Notice of Default by payment of the amount due plus interest as provided in Section 7.3 from the date due until paid. In the case of all other defaults, the default must be cured within thirty (30) days after the Defaulting Party's receipt of the Notice of Default, except as provided in the next sentence. If the Defaulting Party cures the default within the applicable cure period, or if the failure is one (other than the failure to make payments or post credit support) that cannot in good faith be corrected within the thirty (30) day cure period and the Defaulting Party begins to correct the default within the cure period and thereafter continues corrective efforts with reasonable diligence until a cure is effected, the Notice of Default shall be inoperative, and the Defaulting Party shall lose no rights under this Agreement. If, within the specified period, the Defaulting Party does not cure the default or begin to cure the default as provided above, the Non-Defaulting Party may exercise the remedies set forth in Section 19.4.

 19.4 Rights upon Default. After providing notice and an opportunity to cure as provided above, the Non-Defaulting Party shall have the right (but not the duty) to terminate this Agreement by giving written notice to the Defaulting Party.

 19.5 Remedies Not Exclusive. Except as limited by Section 10.1, each and every power and remedy given to the Non-Defaulting Party shall be in addition to every other power and remedy now or hereafter available to the Non-Defaulting Party at law or in equity (including the right to specific performance). No delay or omission in the exercise of any power or remedy and no renewal or extension of any performance due under this Agreement shall impair any such power or remedy or waive any default.

 19.6 Net Out of Payables Upon Termination. Without limiting its remedies under this Agreement, upon termination of this Agreement for default, the Non-Defaulting Party may elect to aggregate all payments due and amounts otherwise owing under this Agreement into a single amount by netting out (a) all payments and other amounts that are due to the Defaulting Party under this Agreement, plus, at the option of the Non-Defaulting Party, any cash or other form of security then available to the Non-Defaulting Party pursuant to Article 7, against (b) all payments and other amounts that are due to the Non-Defaulting Party under this Agreement, so that all such amounts shall be netted out to a single liquidated amount (the "Termination Payment") payable by one Party to the other within thirty (30) days of the date on which the Non-Defaulting Party notifies the Defaulting Party of the amount of the Termination Payment. The Termination Payment shall be payable to or from the Non-Defaulting Party, as appropriate. Notwithstanding Article 10, Seller shall be entitled to recover, upon termination of this Agreement for Power Purchaser's default, all incidental and other costs reasonably incurred by Seller in closing out forward positions and similar transactions entered into in connection with this Agreement, including but not limited to liquidated damages incurred by Seller in closing out mark-to-market arrangements.

 19.7 Closeout Setoffs. After calculation of the Termination Payment in accordance with Section 19.6, if the Defaulting Party would be owed the Termination Payment, the Non-Defaulting Party shall be entitled, at its option and in its discretion, to set off against such Termination Payment any amounts due and owing by the Defaulting Party to the Non-Defaulting Party under any other agreements, instruments or undertakings between the Defaulting Party and the Non-Defaulting Party.

 19.8 Setoff. If PPM fails to pay City Light when such payment is due under this Agreement, City Light may give PPM a notice of nonpayment and suspension. If PPM does not cure the nonpayment within two (2) business days, City Light may suspend deliveries of Scheduled Energy to the extent necessary to set off the nonpayment (with the value of such Scheduled Energy for setoff purposes to be based on the price per MWh at Mid-Columbia for the delivery of firm energy for the applicable hours and period, as published in the Dow Jones Mid-Columbia Electricity Index or its successor). Upon receipt of payment in full from PPM, any deliveries so suspended shall be made up by re-scheduling the delivery of Scheduled Energy in a commercially reasonable manner. If PPM's failure to pay continues for more than ten (10) days after City Light's initial notice, City Light may in addition declare an event of default under Section 19.2.

 EXHIBIT A

 POINT OF METERING

 EXHIBIT B-1

 STATE LINE WIND PROJECT DESCRIPTION

 The Project will be located on private agricultural land located in Umatilla County, Oregon and Walla Walla County, Washington, as more fully set forth in Exhibit B-2, on which Project Developer will obtain wind energy leases or other possessory real estate rights with the landowners. The real estate rights will allow Project Developer to construct and operate wind generation facilities for a defined term; and in exchange, each landowner will receive financial compensation.

 The wind generation facilities include the Turbines more fully described in Exhibits B-2 and B-3 and the electrical system. The Project's electrical system will consist of two key elements: (1) a collector system, which will collect energy at 690 volts from each wind turbine increased to 34.5 kV by a pad-mounted transformer and connect it to the Project substation; and (2) the substation, which will transform energy from 34.5 kV to 230kV (and 115 kV if interconnected to the BPA Transmission System).

 The collector system consists of the padmount transformers and the 34.5 kV electric cables. Each Turbine will generate power at 690 volts. A transformer adjacent to each tower will transform the power to 34.5 kV. Transformers will be located on a transformer pad located approximately 5 feet from the tower pad. From there, power will be transmitted via a combination of underground and overhead 34.5 kV electric cables.

 The substation site will occupy approximately 1 to 2 acres in an area just east of Hatch Grade Road in Washington. The substation site will be a graveled, fenced area with transformer and switching equipment and an area to park utility vehicles. Transformers will be non-polychlorinated biphenyl (PCB) oil-filled types.

 EXHIBIT B-2

 PROJECT MAP

 EXHIBIT B-3

 DESCRIPTION OF TURBINES

 The Project consists of approximately 187 Vestas V-47-660-kW wind turbines located in Walla Walla County, Washington, but may be expanded to include 127Vestas V-47-660-kW wind turbines located in Umatilla County, Oregon and approximately 85 Vestas V-47-660-kW wind turbines located in Walla Walla County, Washington, as more fully set forth in Exhibit B-2. Wind turbines consist of two main components; the turbine tower and the nacelle. The nacelle is the portion of the wind turbine mounted at the top of the tower, which houses the wind turbine itself, the rotor and blades, hub, and gearbox.

 Nacelle: The V-47-660-kW wind turbines operate at wind speeds from 4 to 25 meters per second (m/s) at a relatively constant ( + 10 percent) speed. The turbines operate on a variable pitch principal in which the rotor blades rotate to keep them at the optimum angle to maximize output for all wind speeds. At speeds exceeding 25 m/s, the blades feather (rotate slightly on their axis) and the rotor stops turning. The turbines are equipped with a wind vane that signals wind direction changes to the electronic controller. Within the electronic controller, there is a yaw mechanism, which uses electrical motors to turn the nacelle and rotor so that the turbine faces into the wind.

 Towers: Turbines will be approximately 165 feet tall at the turbine hub, and with the nacelle and blades mounted, the total height of the wind turbine will be approximately 242 feet tall including the turbine blades. The towers will be smooth, hollow steel structures, approximately 14 feet in diameter at the base and weighing approximately 48 tons each. A controller cabinet will be located at the base inside each tower. Cables and a ladder will ascend to the nacelle to provide access for turbine maintenance. A locked door will provide access to the base of the tower. Tower foundations will be spread footing or pier-type footings.

 EXAMPLES

 1. Calculation of Standard Deviation (Definitions, Standard Deviation)

 The Standard Deviation measures the variability of the differences in hourly Storage Energy, when compared with the hourly Storage Energy two hours before, around the mean of such differences. The following example shows the calculation for the month of January 2003. This is a simplified example; a full example showing all hours in the month is attached at the end of this Exhibit.

 Number of hours in January: 744 Integration Amount: 150 MW Hourly Storage Energy in MWh

 Hour in Storage Energy Gj - Gj-2 Gj - Gj-2 - Mean D2 Month Gj MWh = D MWh

 Hour 1 72.425

 Hour 2 144.761

 Hour 3 128.210 55.785 55.785 - (55.785 - ( -0.259) ( -0.259))2

 Hour 4 142.613 (2.148) (2.148) - ((2.148) - ( -0.259) ( -0.259))2

 Hour 5 133.622 5.412 5.412 - ( -0.259) (5.412 - ( -0.259))2

 Hour 6 133.780 (8.833) (8.833) - (8.833 - ( -0.259) ( -0.259))2

 Hour 7 138.229 4.607 4.607 - ( -0.259) (4.607 - ( -0.259))2

 Hour 8 132.700 (1.080) (1.080) - ((1.080) - ( -0.259) ( -0.259))2

 Hour 9 98.995 (39.234) (39.234) - (39.234 - ( -0.259) ( -0.259))2

 Hour 10 68.147 (64.553) (64.553) - (64.553 - ( -0.259) ( -0.259))2

 . . . . .

 . . . . .

 . . . . .

 Hour 742 62.328 0.012 0.012- ( -0.259) (0.012 - ( -0.259))2

 Hour 743 90.189 7.861 7.861 - ( -0.259) (7.861 - ( -0.259))2

 Hour 744 100.690 38.362 38.362 - (38.362 - ( -0.259) ( -0.259))2

 Sum = 44,956.367 Sum = (192.088) Sum = 821,283.664 MWh MWh MWh

 Mean = Mean = 821,283.664/ 44,956.367/744 = (192.088)/(744-2) (742-1) = 1108.345 60.425MW = (0.259) MW MW

 Square root of 1108.345 = 33.292 MW

 As the example above indicates, the calculation of the standard deviation requires the following steps:

 * Measurement of hourly Storage Energy in MWh: columns 1 and 2 in table above

 * Calculation of the difference between the Storage Energy in one hour versus the Storage Energy during the hourly period two hours prior: column 3 in table above

 * Calculation of the mean of such differences, identified in the last row of column 3 in the table above. In this example, the mean of the differences equals -0.259 MW. The sum of the differences is divided by 742 hours (instead of 744) because the differences are

 only computed within the month, which means that the first two hours of the month are not compared with the two hours prior, which are in the previous month. Therefore, the comparisons involve hours three to the end of the month and there are (n - 2)

 observations.

 * Calculation of the differences between the differences in hourly Storage Energy (measured over the Storage Energy two hour prior) and the mean of such differences: column 4 in table above, identified as D

 * Computation of the squares of the differences computed in the previous step, or D2: column 5 in table above

 * Addition of all the squares of the differences computed in step above. In this example, this total equals 821,283.664 MWh.

 * Division of the sum above by the number of observations (742) minus 1, that is, division of 821,283.664 by 741, which equals 1,108.345 MW, as shown in the second to last row in column 5 in the table above

 * Finally, calculation of the square root of the number computed in the previous step, which in this example results in 33.292 MW, as shown in the last row of column 5 in the table above. This number is the Standard Deviation.

 2. Calculation of Invoice: Integration, Variability and Other Charges (Article 6)

 UNCONTROLLABLE FORCES CLAUSE FROM UNDERLYING INTEGRATION AND EXCHANGE AGREEMENT

 Section 18: Uncontrollable Forces

 No Party shall be considered to be in default under this Agreement or in breach of this Agreement if it is delayed or prevented from performing its duties under this Agreement due to uncontrollable forces. For purposes of this Agreement, the term "uncontrollable forces" shall mean any act of God or any other casualty or occurrence, condition, event or circumstance of any kind or nature not reasonably within the excused Party's control (including, without limitation, acts or omissions of any utility regulatory authority or other governmental authority such as a taking by condemnation or power of eminent domain); requirement of any governmental authority; transmission outages or sudden or disruptive electrical events or disturbances; strikes; slow downs or labor difficulties (even though such difficulties could be resolved by conceding to the demands of a labor group); fires; flood; earthquakes; explosions; vehicular accidents or other hazards; acts of public enemies; riots; civil commotions; insurrection; and unavailability of supplies or delays in deliveries by suppliers, vendors or subcontractors of any Party, to the extent such suppliers, vendors or subcontractors are subject to an event of the type described in this sentence; any event considered to be a force majeure event under the Power Purchase Agreement; provided, however, that neither a Party's financial inability to perform any payment obligation pursuant to this Agreement nor any change in a Party's financial condition shall constitute an uncontrollable force. SCL represents and warrants to Pacificorp that a true and correct copy of the force majeure provisions from the Power Purchase Agreement is attached as Exhibit D. SCL shall not amend these provisions without PacifiCorp's prior written consent (which PacifiCorp may not unreasonably withhold, condition or delay). Nothing contained in this Section 18 shall be construed so as to require a Party to settle any strike or labor dispute in which it may be involved. Any Party rendered unable to fulfill any obligation by reason of uncontrollable forces shall exercise due diligence to remove such inability with all reasonable dispatch.

 EXHIBIT E

 BALANCING

 1. Total Project. The combination of the State Line Wind Project and the Expansion Project (the "Total Project").

 2. Total Metered Output. Seller shall cause the Project Developer to record the quantity of Energy (the "Metered Energy") that is produced from the Total Project and measured at (a) the point of metering (the "BPA Metering Point") for the Project Developer's 115kV substation at the Project, which interconnects a portion of the Total Project with BPA's control area (the "BPA Control Area"), and (b) the point of metering (the "PacifiCorp Metering Point") for the Project Developer's 230kV substation at the Project, which interconnects the balance of the Total Project with the PacifiCorp's Control Area (the "PacifiCorp Control Area"). The BPA Metering Point and the PacifiCorp Metering Point are shown on Exhibit A-4 of this Agreement. The quantities of Energy as measured at the BPA Metering Point and the PacifCorp Metering Point shall be added together to determine the total Energy generated by the Total Project (the "Total Metered Output").

 3. Tracking Project Energy Generation by On Peak and Off Peak Hours. Seller shall cause the Project Developer to track the Metered Energy on an hourly basis. On or before the 15th Day of each month, Seller shall submit to Purchaser a report in electronic format (including supporting data files) that separates the Total Metered Output for the prior calendar month into the following six categories:

 (a) Energy delivered to the PacifiCorp Control Area during On Peak Hours;

 (b) Energy delivered to the PacifiCorp Control Area during Off Peak Hours;

 (c) Energy delivered to the BPA Control Area during On Peak Hours;

 (d) Energy Delivered to the BPA Control Area during Off Peak Hours;

 (e) Total Metered Output delivered during On Peak Hours; and

 (f) Total Metered Output delivered during Off Peak Hours.

 4. Purchaser's Capacity Share. The Purchaser's share of the Total Project's Installed Capacity inclusive of the amount it shapes for the Seller (the "Purchaser's Capacity Share") shall be an amount stated in MW that is equal to the product of (a) the sum of (i) the Purchaser's percentage share of the Total Project (as defined in Exhibit C, equal to the sum of Purchaser's share in the Project and Purchaser's share in the Expansion Project, in relation to the total Installed Capacity of the Total Project), and (ii) the percentage share of the Total Project that the Purchaser will shape for the Seller pursuant to the PPM Shaping Agreement, multiplied by (b) the total MW of the Total Project's Installed Capacity. For example, if the Purchaser percentage share plus the percentage share that is being shaped for Seller is equal to 57% of the Total Project's Installed Capacity and the Total Project's Installed Capacity is 263 MW, then the Purchaser's Capacity Share is 57% of  263 MW, or 150 MW.

 5. Purchaser's Uncorrected Share. The Purchaser's Capacity Share as calculated above shall be divided by the Total Project's Installed Capacity that is interconnected to the PacifiCorp Control Area and multiplied by 100% to state a percentage called the "Purchaser's Uncorrected Share." For example, if 179 MW of a total of 263 MW of Installed Capacity is interconnected to the PacifiCorp Control Area, then the Purchaser's Uncorrected Share will be 150/179 or 83.80%.

 6. Allocation of Uncorrected Share to Purchaser's Balancing Account. In each calendar month and for each of the categories listed in Paragraph 3(a) and 3(b) above, the following (the "Uncorrected Allocation") shall be allocated to Purchaser's balancing account: Energy equal to the product of (a) the Purchaser's Uncorrected Share multiplied by (b) the total number of MWh attributable to each such category delivered to the PacifiCorp Control Area in that calendar month, as measured at the PacifiCorp Metering Point. For example, if the Purchaser's Uncorrected Share is 83.80% and the total Energy measured at the PacifiCorp Metering Point during On Peak Hours for January 2003 is 20,000 MWh and the total MWh measured at the PacifiCorp Metering Point during Off Peak Hours for January 2002 is 30,000 MWh, then (20,000 MWh x 83.80% = 16,760 MWh) will be allocated to Purchaser's balancing account for On Peak Hours and (30,000 MWh x 83.80% = 24,140 MWh) will be allocated to Purchaser's balancing account for Off Peak Hours.

 7. Actual Allocations.

 7.1 Purchaser's Actual Allocation. The "Purchaser's Actual Allocation" shall be an amount stated in MWh for each of the categories listed in Paragraphs 3(e) and 3(f) above that is equal to the product of (i) the Purchaser's percentage share of the Total Project's Installed Capacity, as set forth in Exhibit C, multiplied by (ii) the Total Metered Output for each of the categories in Paragraphs 3(e) and 3(f) above.

 7.2 Shaped Actual Allocation. The "Shaped Actual Allocation" shall be an amount stated in MWh for each of the categories listed in Paragraph 3(e) and 3(f) equal to the product of (i) the percentage share that the Purchaser will shape for the Seller under the PPM Shaping Agreement, multiplied by (ii) the Total Metered Output for each of the categories in Paragraphs 3(e) and 3(f).

 7.3 Total Actual Allocation. The "Total Actual Allocation" is an amount stated in MWh for each of the categories listed in Paragraphs 3(e) and 3(f) of this Exhibit that is equal to the sum of (i) the Purchaser's Actual Allocation, plus (ii) the Shaped Actual Allocation.

 8. Correction.

 8.1 On Peak Hours. If the Uncorrected Allocation for On Peak Hours in a given calendar month is greater than the Total Actual Allocation for On Peak Hours in that calendar month, the Purchaser shall return the excess MWh to the Seller as part of the shaped Energy that Purchaser delivers during On Peak Hours under the PPM Shaping Agreement in the "Return Month" (as defined in the PPM Shaping Agreement), as provided in Paragraph 9 of this Exhibit. If the Uncorrected Allocation is less than the Total Actual Allocation for On Peak Hours in a given calendar month, the Purchaser shall reduce its delivery of shaped Energy to the Seller under the PPM Shaping Agreement in the Return Month to the extent of the shortfall in MWh as provided in Paragraph 9 of this Exhibit.

 8.2 Off Peak Hours. The Parties shall apply the procedure set forth in Paragraph 8.1 of this Exhibit to Off Peak Hours.

 8.3 Correction. The difference between the Uncorrected Allocation and the Total Actual Allocation is a "Correction." There will be a Correction for On Peak Hours and a Correction for Off Peak Hours.

 9. Spreading of Correction Across On Peak Hours and Off Peak Hours. The Correction shall be spread evenly across On Peak Hours and Off Peak Hours, as applicable, in the Return Month. To do this, the Correction for On Peak Hours shall be divided by the number of On Peak Hours in the Return Month and the Correction for Off Peak Hours shall be divided by the total number of Off Peak Hours in the Return Month. The Corrections shall be rounded to the nearest MW. Any MWh remaining at the end of the Return Month shall be be transferred as a credit or a debit, as appropriate, to the Shaped Actual Allocation in the calendar month immediately following the Return Month, at which time the Total Actual Allocation shall be adjusted to reflect the Correction remaining from the Return Month, separately for On Peak Hours and Off Peak Hours.

 10. Remaining Correction. If the MWh of Correction remaining at the end of a Return Month cannot be eliminated in the first month following the Return Month, the Parties shall meet promptly to negotiate in good faith a commercially reasonable resolution.

 11. Correction Procedures if the Uncorrected Allocation is Lower than the Purchaser's Actual Allocation.

 11.1 Deficit. If the Uncorrected Allocation is lower than the Purchaser's Actual Allocation, the MWh of deficit shall be transferred to the first month following the Return Month and be subtracted from the Shaped Actual Allocation following the procedure described in paragraph 8 above.

 11.2. Unresolved Deficit. If the deficit identified in paragraph 11.1 above cannot be eliminated in the first month after the Return Month the Parties shall meet promptly to negotiate in good faith a commercially reasonable resolution.

 12. Additional Energy. If Additional Energy is generated from the Project, the Purchaser's Capacity Share, the Purchaser's Uncorrected Share, the Purchaser's Uncorrected Allocation, and the Purchaser's Actual Allocation, shall be adjusted to include such Additional Energy following the procedures in Paragraphs 4 through 11 above.

 13. Example.

 Total Project Installed Capacity = 263 MW

 Installed capacity interconnected to the PacifiCorp Control Area = 179 MW

 Installed capacity interconnected to the BPA Control Area = 84 MW

 Total Metered Output and Tracking Metered Output (Paragraphs 2 and 3)

 Total Metered Output for January 2003 30,000 MWh On Peak

 40,000 MWh Off Peak

 Metered Energy at PacifiCorp Control Area: 20,000 MWh On Peak

 30,000 MWh Off Peak

 Metered Energy at BPA Control Area: 10,000 MWh On Peak

 10,000 MWh Off Peak

 Purchaser's Uncorrected Share (Paragraph 5)

 Purchaser's Percentage Share of the Total Project: 100 MW/263 MW = 38.02%

 Purchaser receives power from the PacifiCorp Control Area (Exhibit C)

 In addition to its 38.02% share, Purchaser shapes 19.01% (50 MW/ 263 MW) of the Project for Seller at Mid-C (PPM Shaping Agreement)

 Purchaser's Capacity Share (Paragraph 4): (38.02% + 19.01%) x 263 MW = 150 MW

 Purchaser's Uncorrected Share (Paragraph 5):

 (150 MW/179 MW) x 100 = 83.80% of Metered Energy on PacifiCorp's system ( Paragraph 2)

 Allocation of Uncorrected Share to Purchaser (Paragraph 6)

 Purchaser's Uncorrected Allocation:

 20,000 MWh On Peak x 83.80% = 16,760 MWh On Peak

 30,000 MWh Off Peak x 83.80% = 25,140 MWh Off Peak

 Actual Allocation (Paragraph 7)

 Purchaser's Actual Allocation (Paragraph 7.1):

 30,000 MWh x 38.02% = 11,406 MWh On Peak

 40,000 MWh x 38.02% = 15,208 MWh Off Peak

 Shaped Actual Allocation (Paragraph 7.2):

 30,000 MWh x 19.01% = 5,703 MWh On Peak

 40,000 MWh x 19.01% = 7,604 MWh Off Peak

 Correction (Paragraph 8)

 On Peak Hours:

 Uncorrected Allocation (, Paragraph 6): 16,760 MWh

 Purchaser's Actual Allocation (Paragraph 7.1): 11,406 MWh

 Shaped Actual Allocation ( Paragraph 7.2): 5,703 MWh

 Total Actual Allocation (Paragraph 7.3): 11,406 + 5,703 = 17,109 MWh

 Correction for On Peak Hours (Paragraph 8): 16,760 MWh - 17,109 MWh = -349 MWh

 Purchaser receives Actual Allocation of 11,406 MWh and reduces shaped Energy for Seller by -349 MWh

 Off Peak Hours:

 Uncorrected Allocation (Paragraph 6): 25,140 MWh

 Purchaser's Actual Allocation (Paragraph 7.1): 15,208 MWh

 Shaped Actual Allocation (Paragraph 7.2): 7,604 MWh

 Total Actual Allocation (Paragraph 7.3): 15,208 + 7,604 = 22,812 MWh

 Correction for Off Peak Hours (Paragraph 8): 25,140 MWh - 22,812 MWh = 2,328 MWh

 Purchaser receives Actual Allocation of 15,208 MWh and increases shaped Energy for Seller by 2,328 MWh

 Spreading of Correction (Paragraph 9)

 Return Month is March 2003

 On Peak hours: (31 - 5) X 16 = 416 hours

 Off Peak hours: (31 - 5) X 8 +5 X 24 = 328 hours

 On Peak Hours:

 349 MWh / 416 hours = 0.8 MW ... round to 1 MW

 In March, every On Peak hour PPM shall receive 1 MW less of shaped Energy (total of 416 MWh)

 Remainder 1 X 416 = 416 MWh

 416 MWh - 349 MWh = 67 MWh

 In April, the Shaped Allocation to PPM will be increased by 67 MWh

 Off Peak Hours:

 2,328 MWh /328 hours = 7.1 MW, round to 7 MW

 Purchaser delivers to Seller 7 MW more each Off Peak hour to Seller than the Shaped Actual Allocation (a total of 2,296 MWh)

 Remainder 7 x 328 = 2,296 MWh

 2,328 MWh - 2,296 MWh = 32 MWh

 In April, the Shaped Allocation to Seller will be increased by 32 MWh.
