 AN ORDINANCE correcting drafting errors to the ordinance (Ordinance 119956) amending the Boost Program; repealing Ordinance 119956; repealing and reenacting Sections 1, 4, 5, and 8 of Ordinance 119602, and repealing Section 11 of Ordinance 119602 to finalize design for a pilot small business contracting program and to clarify the process to be used for the program; and codifying the Boost Program as Chapter 20.49 of the Seattle Municipal Code.

 WHEREAS, The City of Seattle wants to continue to ensure opportunities for small businesses on City contracts, and will work to ensure that those opportunities are in compliance with Title VI, the 1964 Civil Rights Act, and the City's non-discrimination in contracting ordinance; and

 WHEREAS, the Housing, Human Services, Education and Civil Rights Committee ("Committee") considered CB 113221 related to making various changes to the City's Boost Program, Ordinance 119602; and

 WHEREAS, the Committee recommended passage of the CB 113221 with certain changes; and

 WHEREAS, the Council passed Ordinance 119956 (CB 113221 as amended) by the full Council on May 30, 2000; and

 WHEREAS, Ordinance 119956 contained drafting errors such that the ordinance passed does not reflect the changes agreed to by the Council and the Committee; and

 WHEREAS, the intent of this Ordinance is only to correct the drafting errors contained in Ordinance 119956, and not to make additional changes to the City's Boost program; Now, therefore

 BE IT ORDAINED BY THE CITY OF SEATTLE AS FOLLOWS:

 Section 1. Ordinance 119956 is repealed.

 Section 2. Section 1 of Ordinance 119602 is repealed and reenacted to read as follows:

 Findings. The City Council finds the following:

 1. The success of small economically disadvantaged businesses is important to the region's overall economy, including the development of job opportunities and social mobility in the City.

 2. Businesses located within the City that seek contracting opportunities operate under a competitive disadvantage with businesses located elsewhere in the State of Washington because of higher taxes and higher operating and administrative costs (including, but not limited to, higher costs of property acquisition and/or leasing of property).

 3. Economic justice is served by enhancing opportunities for small economically disadvantaged business owners who pursue relevant technical and entrepreneurial training to become more skilled competitors.

 4. Businesses located in King County provide a significant benefit to the economy of the City.

 5. Through its contracting activities, the City is in a position to create important economic incentives to use small economically disadvantaged businesses.

 6. It is in the City's economic interest to provide incentives to encourage small economically disadvantaged businesses to locate and remain within the City.

 Section 3. Section 4 of Ordinance 119602 is repealed and reenacted to read as follows:

 Definitions.

 "Area Economically Benefiting the City" means the area located within King County.

 "Director" means the Director of the Executive Services Department.

 "Located within" the City or an Area Economically Benefiting the City means that a business at least:

 (a) has its primary offices or distribution points (other than residential or post office box) physically within the relevant boundaries; and

 (b) lists the address on a valid business permit as being within the relevant boundaries; and

 (c) has been doing business within the relevant boundaries for at least 12 months; and

 (d) submits other proof as required by the Director.

 "Small Economically Disadvantaged Business" means that a business and the person or persons who own and control it are in a financial condition which puts the business at a substantial disadvantage in attempting to compete for public contracts. In assessing these financial conditions, ESD shall substantially adopt the approach used by the Federal Small Business Administration ("SBA"), provided that the SBA dollar ceilings for various standard business classifications and levels for owners' personal net worth shall be adjusted by the Director to account for local market conditions.

 Section 4. Section 5 of Ordinance 119602 is repealed and reenacted to read as follows:

 Criteria for Participation. To be certified for the Boost Program, a business must be a Small Economically Disadvantaged Business serving a commercially useful function and must meet at least one of the following additional criteria:

 (a) Located within the City of Seattle. A business located within the City, as defined above, may meet this criterion as a means to offset the competitive disadvantages experienced by Small Economically Disadvantaged Businesses and to encourage other such businesses to locate and remain within the City.

 (b) Business Development. A Small Economically Disadvantaged Businesses can meet and maintain this criterion by having the person(s) who owns and controls the business annually complete at least 15 hours of business-related training in a program approved by the Director. In establishing regulations for approval of any such training program, the Director shall look for one or more of the following indications of the program's value: (1) the program's historical use or support from within the relevant industry, (2) any affiliation the program has with established schools, if any, (3) accreditation by an established association.

 (c) Located within an Area Economically Benefiting the City. A Small Economically Disadvantaged Business may meet this criterion by being located within an Area Economically Benefiting the City.

 Section 5. Section 8 of Ordinance 119602 is repealed and reenacted to read as follows:

 Methods of Providing Incentive. The Boost Program shall use one or more methods to create an incentive to promote the use of Boost businesses. This incentive shall be produced either through a bonus system in which the increased participation of Boost businesses is a factor in the award of contracts or a factor in compensation to the contractor, or through a set-aside system under which contractors are required to achieve a specified level of participation by Boost businesses. Where the bonus system is used, the contract shall state the maximum incentive available for Boost participation and the possible methods for making use of the incentive. Where a set-aside system is used, the contract shall state a required minimum utilization. The program may provide additional incentives for Boost businesses meeting two or more of the additional criteria for certification.

 Section 6. ESD shall promulgate rules to implement the "Boost Program" authorized by Ordinance 119602, as amended, in accordance with the requirements of Seattle Municipal Code Ch. 3.02.

 Section 7. Section 11 of Ordinance 119602 is repealed.

 Section 8. ESD shall report to the Housing, Human Services, Education and Civil Rights Committee by no later than November 22, 2000, and annually thereafter on the progress of the Boost program. The report shall include among other things: the number of certified businesses; the utilization rate of Boost businesses on public works projects; the demography of businesses utilized; information regarding consultant contracts implementation status; findings of small business limits and recommendations. In addition, ESD shall report potential changes and strategies for improvement; emerging issues and the status of community outreach/reaction.
