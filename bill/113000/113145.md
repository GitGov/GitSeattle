 ORDINANCE ______

 AN ORDINANCE relating to the City Light Department; authorizing the Superintendent to enter into three related agreements with the Bonneville Power Administration allowing for greater reliability of the interconnected transmission system by providing for Bonneville's use of the Maple Valley to Sno-King 230 kV line #1 and the Maple Valley to Sno-King 230 kV line #2 owned by City Light and by providing for improved transmission reliability on Bonneville's system from the Boundary Project.

 WHEREAS, City Light and Bonneville have been in discussions for over two years regarding Bonneville's request to upgrade, reconnect and use both the Maple Valley to Sno-King 230 kV line #1 and the Maple Valley to Sno-King 230 kV line #2 owned by City Light; and

 WHEREAS, entering into the Maple Valley to Sno-King agreement will put into place a related letter agreement between City Light and Bonneville in which Bonneville pledges to provide power backup (which power is later returned by City Light) when automatic outages at the substations supplying power from City Light's Boundary Project prevent scheduled transmission from occurring; and

 WHEREAS, City Light and Bonneville have agreed to a companion agreement to provide for better planned outage coordination for transmission services at the Boundary Project; and NOW, THEREFORE,

 BE IT ORDAINED BY THE CITY OF SEATTLE AS FOLLOWS:

 Section 1. The Superintendent of the City Light Department is hereby authorized to execute on behalf of the City of Seattle an agreement with the Bonneville Power Administration, substantially in the form of the Contract No. 00TX-10277 attached to this ordinance. The agreement provides for Bonneville's use of City Light's Maple Valley to Sno-King 230 kV line #1 and line #2. The agreement has a term of three years, and it provides for Bonneville to pay City Light up to $500,000 completing vegetation removal in the transmission corridor. The agreement also provides for Bonneville to pay City Light $700,000 per year in monthly installments for the term of the agreement.

 Section 2. Upon entering into this agreement, the Superintendent is also authorized to activate a letter agreement with Bonneville (Contract No. 00PB-10654) in the form attached to this ordinance. This letter agreement is contingent on the agreement authorized by Section 1, and provides for back up power to be supplied by Bonneville when automatic outages at the substations supplying power from City Light's Boundary Project prevent scheduled transmission from occurring. The power is later returned by City Light.

 Section 3. The Superintendent is further authorized to enter into an Outage Planning agreement with Bonneville, substantially in the form of Agreement No. 00TX-10293, attached to this ordinance which will provide for planned outage coordination for transmission services at the Boundary Project throughout the term of the current and any continuing transmission agreements with Bonneville to supply transmission from Seattle's Boundary Project.

 Section 4. Any acts taken in furtherance of this ordinance prior to its effective date are hereby ratified and confirmed.

 Section 5. This ordinance shall take effect and be in force thirty (30) days from and after its approval by the Mayor, but if not approved and returned by the Mayor within ten (10) days after presentation, it shall take effect as provided by Municipal Code Section 1.04.020.

 Contract No. 00TX-10277

 Settlement Agreement

 Mr. Gary Zarker, Superintendent

 Seattle City Light

 700 Fifth Avenue, Suite 3300

 Seattle, WA 98104-5031

 Dear Gary:

 As the result of discussions between Bonneville Power Administration (BPA), Transmission Business Line and Seattle City Light (Seattle), the parties have agreed on the following terms of a settlement of their dispute concerning both parties' obligations to meet established reliability criteria. By entering into this settlement, neither party admits any liability to the other party and expressly retains all legal arguments concerning BPA's or Seattle's rights to use their respective systems in the Puget Sound area and Seattle's and BPA's obligation to operate and maintain said lines.

 1. MAPLE VALLEY TO SNO-KING 230 KV LINE #1

 1.1 Seattle has completed the construction and tree clearing work specified in BPA Contract No. 98TX-10166, and restored the normal line configuration, of the Maple Valley to Sno-King 230 kV line #1 (MV-SNK #1) effective November, 1999.

 1.2 Seattle will operate and maintain, and perform continuing vegetation management on the MV-SNK #1 line, in the same manner and to the same standards for all other Seattle owned transmission.

 1.3 Seattle has established the line rating at 891 amps (continuous) at thirty degrees Centigrade ambient temperature, and 1063 amps (emergency) and will make best efforts to maintain such rating.

 2. MAPLE VALLEY TO SNO-KING 230 KV LINE #2

 2.1 By March 1, 2000, or as soon as possible thereafter using best efforts, Seattle shall:

 2.1.1 Clear sufficient trees in the Maple Valley to Sno-King 230 kV Line #2 (MV-SNK #2) right-of-way to make the line operational for Seattle's and BPA's system needs.

 2.1.2 Allow connection of the MV-SNK #2 at Maple Valley Substation and at Sno-King Substation; and

 2.1.3 Operate and maintain, and perform continuing vegetation management on the MV-SNK #2 line, in the same manner and to the same standards for all other Seattle owned transmission.

 2.1.4 Establish the line rating at 891 amps (continuous) at thirty degrees Centigrade ambient temperature, and 1063 amps (emergency); provided, however, that if Seattle is enjoined by a court of competent jurisdiction from completing tree clearing to establish such rating, Seattle shall use best efforts to contest such injunction and Seattle's performance shall be delayed until final resolution of such litigation. After Seattle has established such rating, Seattle shall use best efforts to maintain such rating.

 2.2 BPA:

 2.2.1 Has installed a 230 kV breaker at Sno-King Substation to accommodate the connection in section 2.1.2;

 2.2.2 Has installed a 230 kV breaker at Maple Valley Substation to accommodate the connection in section 2.1.2.

 2.2.3 Shall perform the necessary work to connect the MV-SNK #2 line at Maple Valley Substation and at Sno-King Substation.

 3. OPERATING PROCEDURES

 3.1 The parties will agree to each utility's operating procedure for the MV-SNK #1 and #2 lines prior to the commercial operation of MV-SNK #2.

 4. SNO-KING TO BOTHELL 230 KV LINE #2

 4.1 Seattle recognizes BPA's request to connect Seattle's Sno-King Bothell #2 230 kV transmission line to Seattle's Snohomish-Bothell #2 230 kV transmission line. Seattle agrees to make best efforts to work with BPA to allow a connection by June 1, 2000, or as soon thereafter as possible, between the parties in a manner that is compatible with Seattle's use of the line as a temporary connection between Seattle and the Snohomish County PUD systems, and all parties longer term transmission needs.

 5. PAYMENT FOR SETTLEMENT OF DISPUTE

 5.1 BPA will pay Seattle the actual costs associated with vegetation removal specified in section 2.1.1 above, not to exceed $500,000, upon completion of the remaining vegetation removal.

 Seattle shall send invoices to:

 Seattle City Light Transmission Account Executive

 Bonneville Power Administration

 RE: Contract No. 00TX-10277

 P.O. Box 491 - TM/Ditt2

 Vancouver, WA 98666

 BPA will reimburse Seattle for all invoiced costs associated with vegetation removal within thirty (30) days of the billing date. Late payments will be subject to interest charge of 1.5 percent per month on the unpaid balance.

 5.2 Upon establishment of the line rating by Seattle pursuant to section 2.1.4, BPA will pay Seattle $700,000 per year, paid by monthly installments, for the term of this Agreement.

 6. CONTIGUOUS POD TREATMENT

 6.1 The interconnection described in this Agreement shall not interfere with Seattle's Contiguous Points of Delivery for receipt of power delivered to Seattle by BPA's transmission system under Seattle's Point-to-Point Transmission Agreement, Contract No. 96MS- 96018.

 7. TERM

 7.1 The term of this agreement shall be for three years from March 1, 2000 through February 28, 2003, or three years from the date that Seattle establishes the rating described in section 2.1.4; however, the term shall not exceed June 1, 2003. Seattle agrees to implement the Agreement upon execution for 6 months, pending the formal approval of Seattle City Council.

 8. MISCELLANEOUS

 8.1 AGENCY PROVISIONS. BPA and Seattle agree that neither party is the agent or principal for the other, and the parties agree that they will not represent to any other party that they act in the capacity of agent or principal for the other.

 8.2 HOLD HARMLESS. To the extent allowed by law, which in the case of BPA is the Federal Tort Claims Act, each party shall indemnify and hold the other party harmless from all claims, damages, losses, liability and expenses arising from the first party's own negligent or other tortious acts or omissions of its officers, employees, or agents, in the performance of obligations arising under this Agreement.

 8.3 Nothing contained in this Agreement shall be construed to limit or exclude any right or remedy of either party (arising on account of the breach or default by the other party or otherwise) now or hereafter existing under any provision of any other Agreement, or by operation of law.

 Should Seattle find this Agreement acceptable, please sign both originals, retain one original for your files, and send the other original to me at the address above. This offer is valid until February 29, 2000, after which time it is withdrawn.

 Mr. Gary Zarker, Superintendent

 Seattle City Light

 700 Fifth Avenue, Suite 3300

 Seattle, WA 98104-5031

 Dear Gary:

 Pursuant to recent discussions between the Bonneville Power Administration Transmission Business Line (BPA TBL) and Seattle City Light (Seattle) regarding outage planning for BPA TBL's transmission system, BPA TBL and Seattle agree as follows:

 1. Seattle will sign up for BPA TBL's Transmission Capacity E-Mail Forum, the mechanism whereby transmission customers and market participants comment on planned transmission outages, and agrees to comment on proposed planned outages that affect Seattle's Boundary hydroelectric generator or other Seattle resources through that Forum.

 2. Through its outage planning process, BPA TBL will seek to minimize spill at Seattle's Boundary hydroelectric generator when scheduling transmission system outages for planned maintenance and related activities.

 3. This agreement shall run with the term of the current and any future transmission agreements between Seattle and BPA TBL for transmission services for generation from Seattle's Boundary hydroelectric generator.

 Should Seattle find this agreement acceptable, please sign both originals, retain one original for your files, and send the other original to me at the address above. Feel free to call Sally Long at (360) 418-8285 if you have any questions.
