 AN ORDINANCE creating an Alcohol Impact Area in Pioneer Square and requiring a report to Council by March 1, 2001 regarding voluntary efforts to reduce chronic public inebriation.

 WHEREAS, Section 314-12-215 of the Washington Administrative Code ("WAC") provides that as a condition precedent to the City requesting that the Washington State Liquor Control Board enact additional restrictions on off-premises alcohol sales within an area of the City adversely affected by chronic public inebriation or illegal activity associated with alcohol sales or consumption, an ordinance must designate such an area as an Alcohol Impact Area; and

 WHEREAS, the King County Board of Health has declared by resolution that chronic public inebriation is a public health problem of the highest order; and

 WHEREAS, over the past four years the Chronic Public Inebriate Systems Solution Committee, a community-based partnership representing local neighborhood associations, the business community, health care and human service providers, citizen advocates and Seattle and King County governments has developed a comprehensive strategy to reduce chronic public inebriation, including expanded and improved access to treatment, housing, case management, and vocational development as well as law enforcement, and

 WHEREAS, an important element in the plan to reduce chronic public inebriation is to restrict the availability of alcohol sold to chronic public inebriates in areas where such sales threaten both the public's health, safety and welfare and that of the chronic public inebriates;

 Now therefore,

 BE IT ORDAINED BY THE CITY OF SEATTLE AS FOLLOWS:

 Section 2.

 Pioneer Square Alcohol Impact Area.

 That area bounded by South King Street on the South, Alaskan Way on the West, Columbia Street on the North and Fourth Avenue on the East, including in all instances both sides of each boundary street.

 B. By March 1, 2001, the Director of the Department of Neighborhoods and the Chief of Police shall provide a report to the Council's Finance, Budget and Economic Development Committee on the voluntary efforts to address chronic public inebriation issues in the Pioneer Square Alcohol Impact Area. This report shall include relevant crime statistics, police reports, emergency medical response data, detoxification reports, sanitation reports, public health records and other information which document the success or failure of efforts to address chronic public inebriation issues in the Pioneer Square Alcohol Impact Area. Based on the information contained in the report, the Council may consider the adoption of legislation directing the Chief of Police to request the State Liquor Control Board to impose further restrictions on liquor licensees, pursuant to WAC 314- 12-215, in the Pioneer Square Alcohol Impact Area. Such legislation must be adopted by Council before any representative of the City requests the State Liquor Control Board to impose such restrictions.

 Section 3. This ordinance shall take effect and be in force thirty (30) days from and after its approval by the Mayor, but if not approved and returned by the Mayor within ten (10) days after presentation, it shall take effect as provided by Municipal Code Section 1.04.020.
