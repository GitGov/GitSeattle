 Attachment A: Preliminary Draft Agreement for the Rainier Court Brownfields Project December 4, 2001 (Version 3)t ATTACHMENT A DRAFT PRELIMINARY AGREEMENT FOR THE RAINIER COURT BROWNFIELDS PROJECT

 Between King County Office of Regional Policy and Planning and City of Seattle Office of Economic Development

 THIS AGREEMENT is made between King County, acting through its Director of the Office of Regional Policy and Planning (herein after known as "ORPP"), and The City of Seattle, acting through its Director of the Office of Economic Development (hereinafter known as "OED"), to fund environmental assessment of certain property intended to be included in the Rainier Court Brownfields project.

 In consideration of the mutual covenants set forth below, the parties agree as follows:

 I. Statement of Purpose:

 To provide SouthEast Effective Development (SEED), a non-profit community development corporation, with $25,000 to fund environmental assessments of key parcels to be part of the Rainier Court Brownfields project. The assessments will provide key information on the environmental condition of the parcels. This information is required by Simpson Development, SEED's development partner in the project, prior to preparation of the recommended remediation plan to be presented to the Washington State Department of Ecology ("DOE") for clean up of the project site. Simpson needs an indication from DOE on the extent of clean up required before it can finalize its due diligence investigation and commit to the project. This information also is needed by SEED to secure financing for the overall project. A prompt transfer of the funds from the County to the City as agreed to in this agreement will help ensure SEED maintains its schedule for preparing and submitting the proposed remediation plan to DOE and for developing Rainier Court.

 II. Background:

 A. Rainier Court Project

 Rainier Court, when completed, will be the largest and most significant City-supported community revitalization project developed in Southeast Seattle in the last 20 years. Development of this 8-acre site located at 3700 Rainier Avenue South in Seattle is intended to provide affordable housing and jobs, act as a catalyst for additional redevelopment, stimulate local reinvestment, and create pride and ownership in one of Rainier Valley's most diverse neighborhoods, Courtland Place. The current plans for the project include the following:

 The project will be a multifamily housing project with retail on the ground level. The housing will be a mixture of market rate and affordable rental units, including live/work space and, possibly, for-sale townhouses. The project will be developed in two phases. Phase I will include approximately 455 units in three, four-story buildings with about 23,000 square feet of retail on the first floors. Construction is expected to start in 2003. Phase II would be constructed in 2004 and include 88 units, in a complex of two- story flats/townhouses.

 The project has had long-standing support from the community and The City of Seattle.

 B. Environmental Cleanup

 Knowledge of the nature of the environmental contamination on the site and associated clean-up costs are critical elements of the Rainier Court project's overall project feasibility. The remediation costs can only be determined once a thorough assessment has been made of the nature and level of the contamination on the site. Analysis performed by EPA for this project has provided extensive information on soil contamination, but has provided limited information on groundwater conditions. The proposed additional assessments will gather more extensive information on groundwater conditions, including data from test wells strategically located in and around the site. This information will be used in the proposed remediation plan that will be prepared and submitted to DOE and is needed to enable DOE to provide the maximum possible guidance regarding SEED's proposed cleanup method for the project site. This guidance from DOE will, in turn, allow SEED to determine the site remediation expense for the project. If SEED can demonstrate that the cost to clean up the site will not be prohibitively expensive, a lender will be willing to provide the financing needed by SEED to develop Rainier Court, assuming the project meets the lender's other financing requirements. SEED hopes to submit the proposed remediation plan to DOE by the end of the year in order to meet key project milestones.

 III. Sources and Amounts of Funding:

 The environmental sampling and analysis is being funded through the King County/City of Seattle Brownfields Showcase Community Program (Brownfields Program). The Brownfields Program is designed to assist public, private and nonprofit entities assess, clean up and redevelop contaminated brownfield properties and is funded primarily through grants from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). In 2000, ORPP was awarded supplemental funding by EPA for the Brownfields Program, $150,000 of which is to be used to assess properties to be used for commercial or industrial redevelopment. Of the $150,000, $25,000 is designated for the Rainier Court project.

 King County agrees to provide to OED, for the purposes stated below, a minimum of $25,000 in grant funds provided by EPA.

 Additional funding may be added and managed under this agreement at a later date. The funding delineated above shall not be used for any costs of staffing or administrative overhead incurred by the parties.

 IV. Use of Funds:

 The funds provided to OED under this agreement shall be used to pay costs of environmental assessments of property intended to be part of the Rainier Court project, under a contract or contracts between OED and SEED. The assessments may include but not be limited to environmental sampling, surveying and cleanup planning and design, subject to approval by ORPP.
