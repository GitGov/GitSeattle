 ORDINANCE ____________

 AN ORDINANCE relating to the Department of Parks and Recreation; appropriating funds for two Capital Improvement Program Projects: the Seward Park Habitat Improvements Project and the Smith Cove Navy Property Acquisition Project; and increasing the expenditure authority of the Department in the 2001 Adopted Budget; all upon a three-fourths vote of the City Council.

 WHEREAS, the Seward Park Salmon Habitat Improvements Project provides for implementation of recommendations from a study completed earlier this year by the Army Corps of Engineers in consultation with state and federal resource agencies; and

 WHEREAS, the project will provide for nearshore substrate modification along the eastern edge of the Seward Park shoreline, remove an old concrete bulkhead, develop a soft shore with riparian plantings along a portion of the southern shoreline of the park, and provide for other riparian plantings elsewhere around the park shoreline; and

 WHEREAS, the nearshore substrate modification is being undertaken with Seattle Public Utilities and the Army Corps of Engineers as part of the ongoing general investigation studies on Lake Washington; and

 WHEREAS, the studies have already involved pre-construction monitoring of the park's eastern shore by the United States Fish and Wildlife Service and the Washington Department of Fisheries to assess utilization of the area by chinook salmon and bass (a salmon predator); and

 WHEREAS, the Army Corps of Engineers will import gravels to cover rock from a failed bulkhead in order to improve conditions for juvenile salmon and further monitoring will occur in succeeding years to assess the effectiveness of this demonstration project; and

 WHEREAS, Seattle Public Utilities and Parks will jointly provide the local matching monies for the Corps project; and

 WHEREAS, the Smith Cove Navy Property Acquisition Project will provide for the acquisition of Navy property that is comprised of an uplands greenbelt and a flat meadow area whose exact boundaries are being determined by a survey; and

 WHEREAS, the absence of "water access" has resulted in this project being ineligible for funding previous allocated to it from the state's Inter-Agency Committee for Outdoor Recreation (IAC), and the IAC funding previously allocated to this project has been reprogrammed; and

 WHEREAS, further park development will be determined by a community process and a market appraisal to determine the property's value is underway; and

 WHEREAS, both projects were approved in the 2001-2006 Capital Improvement Program and the requested funding is available;

 NOW THEREFORE, BE IT ORDAINED BY THE CITY OF SEATTLE AS FOLLOWS:
