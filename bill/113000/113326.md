 WHEREAS, the Fairview - Valley corridor realignment project in South Lake Union will improve safety and reduce accidents. The corridor is a high accident area, currently averaging 42 accidents per year.

 WHEREAS, the Fairview-Valley corridor realignment project will reduce congestion and result in a more efficient flow of traffic. Levels of service on the Mercer on- and off- ramps to Interstate 5 and on the northbound leg of Fairview Avenue North will be improved. In addition, emergency response time will be improved; and

 WHEREAS, the Fairview-Valley corridor realignment project is a high priority in the South Lake Union Neighborhood Plan, and is contained in the neighborhood plan adoption matrix; and
