 9. The failure of the Grantee, or of its successors and assigns, to comply with any of the conditions and covenants contained in this deed shall constitute a default if such default shall continue, after written notice from the Grantor specifically identifying the nature of the default, for a period of not less than ninety (90) days, or such longer period as may be reasonably required to cure the default, provided the Grantee commences the cure within said ninety (90) days after the Grantor's written notice of default and covenants to diligently complete the cure within such reasonable period. In the event the Grantee is in default of any covenant or condition contained in this deed relating to the use of the property for park and recreation purposes or to nondiscrimination, only, then upon failure to eliminate, rectify, cure, or commence action to cure said breach within the time agreed upon , all right, title, and interest in and to said premises shall, at the Grantor's option revert to and become the property of the Grantor. In addition to all other remedies for such breach, the Grantee, its successors and assigns, at the Grantor's option, shall forfeit all right, title, and interest in any and all of the tenements, hereditaments, and appurtenances thereunto belonging. With regard thereto, the Grantee shall execute a deed, as directed by the Grantor, covering all interest in the premises and improvements thereon to the Grantor. The failure of the grantor to require in any one of more instances complete performance of any of the conditions or covenants shall not be construed as a waiver or relinquishment or such future performance, but obligation of the Grantee, its successors and assigns, with respect to such future performance shall continue in full force and effect.

 10. The Grantee acknowledges that said property is located within the vicinity of general aviation airports, and covenants and agrees to obtain a determination of no hazard to air navigation issued by the Federal Aviation Administration, as required by 14 CFR 77, for any proposed structures on the subject parcel.

 11. The Grantee, by its acceptance of this deed, covenants and agrees that in the event the Grantor exercises its option to revert all right, title, and interest in the property to the Grantor, or the Grantee voluntarily returns title to the property in lieu of a reverter, then the Grantee shall provide protection to and maintenance of said property at all times until such time as the title is actually reverted or returned to and accepted by the Grantor, including the period of any notice of intent to revert. Such protection and maintenance shall, at a minimum, conform to the standards prescribed by the General Services Administration in its regulations FPMR 101- 47.402 in effect as of the date of this deed.
