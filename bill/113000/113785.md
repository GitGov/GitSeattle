The fee for the year July 6, 1980 - July 5, 1981, shall be Four Hundred Twenty-Three Dollars ($423.00) (called "the base amount"). It shall be increased or decreased from such base amount in accordance with fluctuations in the purchasing power of the dollar. The rate of increase or decrease in the value of money shall be measured as of JULY each year using the Consumer Price Index issued by the United States Department of Labor for the Seattle-Everett area for all Urban Consumers, and, in the event of its discontinuance, by another comparable index. The fee shall also be subject to revision as provided in Section 2.

 The Permittee, its successors and assigns, shall pay to the City such amounts as may be justly chargeable by said City as costs of inspection of said tunnel during construction, reconstruction, repair, annual structural inspections, and at other times under the direction of the Director of Transportation and in addition shall promptly pay to the City in advance upon statements rendered by the Director of Transportation an annual fee for the privileges granted and exercised hereunder of Two Thousand Ninety-One Dollars ($2,091.00) for each of the first five years of the renewal period between July 6, 2000, and July 5, 2010.

All payments shall be made to the City Finance Director for credit to the General Fund.
