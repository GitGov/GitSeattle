 AN ORDINANCE related to cable television; amending Seattle Municipal Code Chapter 21.60 to establish a city-wide cable television franchise district, raise the application fee for franchise applications, establish transition rules for services in previously unfranchised areas, and establish an administrative waiver to service requirements.

 WHEREAS, the granting of cable television franchises is the method provided by State and Federal law for assuring that citizens are provided cable television services that meet community needs and interests; and

 WHEREAS, the Telecommunications Act of 1996 established a national policy to promote competition in telecommunications and cable television services and encourage the deployment of advanced technology; and

 WHEREAS, the City in granting both franchise renewals and a competitive franchise in 1996 established policies that are consistent with this national policy; and

 WHEREAS, the provisions of Chapter 21.60 which govern the granting of cable television franchises are not current with the changes in federal law, nor do they fully reflect the policies adopted in the 1996 franchise ordinances; and

 WHEREAS, the promotion of competition will be served by the creation of a City-wide franchise district option with provisions to assure that consumers now served in any unfranchised area have appropriate transition opportunities; and

 WHEREAS, the cost of reviewing a franchise application and negotiating a franchise should be recovered in the franchise application fee; Now, therefore,

For the purpose of granting an administrative waiver, the presence of three cable services franchise grantees providing services throughout the area of the waiver shall constitute effective competition.

 Section 6. SMC 21.60.390 is amended to read as follows:

 SMC 21.60.390 Erection of poles and wires -- Undergrounding.

Prior to the approval of a Franchise for the Central Business Franchise District or a Citywide Franchise, the Director of the Department of Information Technology shall propose a Transition Rule for Council adoption to balance the desire to have cable television services provided by franchise holders for the district in which services are provided, to minimize customers who desire cable service from being denied such service, and to have current cable services customers protected from a reduction in service or increase in cost as a result of the issuance of the franchise for the Central Business Franchise District or Citywide franchise.

 Section 8. Any acts done consistent with the authority granted herein and prior to the effective date of this ordinance are hereby ratified and confirmed.

 Section 9. This ordinance shall take effect and be in force thirty (30) days from and after its approval by the Mayor, but if not approved and returned by the Mayor within ten (10) days after presentation, it shall take effect as provided by Municipal Code Section 1.04.020.
