 AN ORDINANCE relating to Ordinance 119738, and directing the City Clerk to replace an incorrect map identified in that Ordinance.

 Whereas, as a result of the Denny Triangle neighborhood planning process a rezone was proposed for three half-blocks located between Lenora and Blanchard Street in the vicinity of Sixth and Seventh avenues, and

 Whereas, during its consideration of the proposed rezone the City Council decided to expand the rezone area to include an additional half-block located between Lenora and Blanchard and fronting on Eighth Avenue, and

 Whereas, the City Council conducted an additional public hearing on September 21, 1999 for the express purpose of receiving public comment regarding the proposed expansion of the rezone area, and

 Whereas, on October 19, 1999 the Council's Business, Economic and Community Development Committee considered the proposed rezone, including the expanded rezone area, and voted to recommend approval of the rezone as expanded, and

 Whereas, on November 1, 1999 the full City Council considered the proposed rezone, and at that meeting understood that the proposed rezone included the expanded rezone area based upon staff briefing provided to the Council, and

 Whereas, by clerical error the original rezone map contained in the Clerk's file, Exhibit A-1 to Ordinance 119738, was not replaced with an amended rezone map showing the expanded rezone area before the Council voted on Ordinance 119738, and

 Whereas, when the Council adopted Ordinance 119738 it intended to and believed it was approving the expanded rezone rather than the rezone as originally proposed, and that Exhibit A-1 was an incorrect map and erroneously retained in the Clerk's file, and

 Whereas, the Council finds that Exhibit A-1 should be replaced by Exhibit B, attached, which shows the expanded rezone area which the Council intended to rezone when it approved Ordinance 119738,

 NOW THEREFORE, BE IT ORDAINED BY THE CITY OF SEATTLE AS FOLLOWS:

 Section 1. The City Clerk is directed to replace Exhibit A-1 of Ordinance 119738, with Exhibit B, a copy of which is attached hereto. The Council hereby ratifies the rezone of the expanded rezone area as shown on Exhibit B.

 Section 2. This ordinance shall take effect and be in force thirty (30) days from and after its approval by the Mayor, but if not approved and returned by the Mayor within ten (10) days after presentation, it shall take effect as provided by Municipal Code Section 1.04.020.

 Approved by me this _____ day of _________________, 2000. ___________________________________________ Mayor
