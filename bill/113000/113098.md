 AN ORDINANCE increasing the utility business tax on the business of selling or furnishing water; and amending Seattle Municipal Code Section 5.48.050.

 WHEREAS, Seattle Municipal Code Section 5.48.050 establishes a utility business tax on the selling or furnishing water for hire at a rate of ten percent (10%) of the total gross income of such retail business in the City; and

 WHEREAS, pending the completion of environmental review, the City is considering becoming a participant in and making a major financial commitment to the joint development with the City of Tacoma and certain other utilities of the proposed Second Supply Project, which would allow water from Tacoma's second water right on the Green River to be brought to Seattle's Cedar River water supply system; and

 WHEREAS, the City finds that the indirect administrative overhead costs to be incurred by the City's general fund in connection with the Second Supply Project in particular and in connection with providing for the environmentally responsible stewardship of the City's water supply system in general warrants increasing the City's utility business tax on the sale or furnishing of water; and

 WHEREAS, the City believes that the purported blanket voter approval requirement Section 2 of Initiative 695 is neither constitutionally valid as applied to City taxes, which are all specifically authorized by existing legislation, nor in the public interest;

 NOW THEREFORE, BE IT ORDAINED BY THE CITY OF SEATTLE AS FOLLOWS:

 Section 1. Subsection C of Section 5.48.050 of the Seattle Municipal Code is amended as follows:

 5.48.050 Occupations subject to tax-Amount.

 C. Upon everyone, including The City of Seattle, engaged in or carrying on the business of selling or furnishing water for hire, a fee or tax equal to ~~ten percent (10%)~~ten and one tenth percent (10.1%) of the total gross income from such retail business in the City; provided that as to The City of Seattle in the conduct of its municipal water utility, such tax shall be applicable to the business of such utility done without, as well as within, the City.

 Section 2. Anyone wishing to file a petition opposing this tax increase must file a referendum petition with the City Clerk pursuant to RCW 35.21.706 within 7 (seven) days after passage of the ordinance by the City Council.

 Section 3. This ordinance shall take effect and be in force thirty (30) days from and after its approval by the Mayor, but if not approved and returned by the Mayor within ten (10) days after presentation, it shall take effect as provided in Municipal Code Section 1.04.020.
