 AN ORDINANCE creating an Alcohol Impact Area in Pioneer Square and authorizing appropriate city officials to request the Washington State Liquor Control Board to restrict off-premises alcohol sales in the Alcohol Impact Area if voluntary efforts to reduce chronic public inebriation are not successful.

 WHEREAS, Section 314-12-215 of the Washington Administrative Code ("WAC") provides that as a condition precedent to the City requesting that the Washington State Liquor Control Board enact additional restrictions on off-premises alcohol sales within an area of the City adversely affected by chronic public inebriation or illegal activity associated with alcohol sales or consumption, an ordinance must designate such an area as an Alcohol Impact Area; and

 WHEREAS, the King County Board of Health has declared by resolution that chronic public inebriation is a public health problem of the highest order; and

 WHEREAS, over the past four years the Chronic Public Inebriate Systems Solution Committee, a community-based partnership representing local neighborhood associations, the business community, health care and human service providers, citizen advocates and Seattle and King County governments has developed a comprehensive strategy to reduce chronic public inebriation, including expanded and improved access to treatment, housing, case management, and vocational development as well as law enforcement, and

 WHEREAS, an important element in the plan to reduce chronic public inebriation is to restrict the availability of alcohol sold to chronic public inebriates in areas where such sales threaten both the public's health, safety and welfare and that of the hronic public inebriates;

 Now therefore,
