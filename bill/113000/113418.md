This tax is levied for the purpose of raising revenue to finance the various departments and activities of the municipal government of the City of Seattle for the fiscal (calendar) year 2001. The following two sentences are provided for information only: This levy has been calculated at the following dollar rates per thousand dollars of assessed value: Three Dollars and Fifteen Cents ($3.15) for general municipal purposes as allowed by RCW 84.52.043; Twenty-two and One-half Cents ($0.225) for the Firemen's Pension Fund as allowed by RCW 41.16.060; and Twenty-two and One-half Cents ($0.225) for general municipal purposes as allowed by RCW 41.16.060. This levy includes an amount of Eight Hundred Twenty-eight Thousand Dollars ($828,000) for low-income housing that is not restricted to serving very low-income households, in accordance with Ordinance 117711; an amount of Ten Million Dollars ($10,000,000) for educational and developmental services in accordance with Ordinance 118557; and an amount of Sixteen Million Five Hundred Thousand Dollars ($16,500,000) to improve the Opera House, replace the Flag Pavilion, and expand nine Parks Department community recreation centers in accordance with Ordinance 119522.

 (ii) In addition, there is also hereby levied a tax on all taxable property, both real and personal, within the City of Seattle and subject to taxation under the laws of the State of Washington, in the amount of Seven Million, Six Hundred Thirty Thousand, Seven Hundred Fourteen Dollars ($7,630,714), such tax being levied for the purpose of financing affordable housing for very low-income households pursuant to RCW 84.52.105, pursuant to Ordinance 117711, which tax levy shall be outside of and in addition to the limitations in RCW 84.52.043.

 B. If the total of the amounts of taxes imposed in subsections 1.A(i) and (ii) exceeds One Hundred Ninety-two Million Two Hundred Eighty-eight Thousand One Hundred Dollars ($192,288,100), then the total levy made in subsection 1.A shall be reduced to One Hundred Ninety-two Million Two Hundred Eighty-eight Thousand One Hundred Dollars ($192,288,100) or the rate necessary to produce that amount.

 Section 2. Pursuant to Chapter 3, Laws of 1997, as approved by the voters of the state on November 4, 1997, and because of the investments of resources that will be necessary in 2001 in order to implement the City Council's and Mayor's top budget priorities for both the operating budget and the 2001-2006 Capital Improvement Program, as reflected in Resolution 30224, and in order to continue to carry out the 2000-2005 Capital Improvement Program, and to reserve the potential for preserving future levy capacity under RCW 84.55.092, the City Council finds that there is a substantial need to use and hereby does use one hundred and six percent (106%) as the regular property tax limit factor, formerly known as the "106% lid," for regular property taxes to be collected in 2001.
