 AN ORDINANCE relating to land use, amending Plat 43E, page 115, Plat 44W, page 116, Plat 50E, page 129, and Plat 51W, page 130 of the Official Land Use Map, Seattle Municipal Code Section 23.32.016, to rezone property generally bounded by Alaskan Way South, Railroad Way South, First Avenue South, South Royal Brougham Way, Fourth Avenue South, South Holgate Street, and Utah Avenue South, and implementing a rezone recommendation of the Greater Duwamish Manufacturing/Industrial Center Plan.

 WHEREAS, on July 25, 1994, by Ordinance 117221, the City Council adopted the Seattle Comprehensive Plan, which includes a neighborhood planning element; and

 WHEREAS, pursuant to that neighborhood planning element, the Greater Duwamish Planning Committee developed a plan for the Duwamish Manufacturing/Industrial Center; and

 WHEREAS, the Greater Duwamish Manufacturing/Industrial Center Neighborhood Plan proposed the creation of a Stadium Transition Area Overlay District, and the rezoning of an area around the stadiums to Industrial Commercial with the Stadium Transition Area Overlay; and

 WHEREAS, legislation accompanying this ordinance creates a Stadium Transition Area Overlay District, and all the properties rezoned by this ordinance are located within that area and meet the criteria for rezoning to Industrial Commercial and inclusion in the Stadium Transition Area Overlay District; and

 WHEREAS, the City Council encourages innovative proposals to further the City's goals and policies, if such proposals would require further modification of zoning, the City Council encourages submission of petitions for changes on properties within the Stadium Transition Area Overlay District;

 WHEREAS, the City Council finds that the land use code changes established by this ordinance will protect and promote the health, safety and welfare of the general public;

 NOW THEREFORE, BE IT ORDAINED BY THE CITY OF SEATTLE AS FOLLOWS:

 Section 1. The Official Land Use Map zoning classification for the properties, as adopted by Ordinance 113658 and established on Plat 43E, page 115, Plat 44W, page 116, Plat 50E, page 129, and Plat 51W, page 130 of the Official Land Use Map, is amended to rezone the properties from Industrial General (IG) 2 U/85 to Industrial Commercial (IC)-65 and to Industrial Commercial (IC) - 85, as shown on "Exhibit A" attached to this ordinance.

 Section 2. The City Clerk is hereby authorized and directed to file a copy of this ordinance and attached "Exhibit A" at the King County Records and Elections Division, and to deliver copies of the same to the Director of the Department of Design, Construction and Land Use and to the King County Assessor's Office.

 Section 3. The rezone of the parcel generally bounded by Alaskan Way South, First Avenue South, South Dearborn Street and South Royal Brougham Way accomplished by this ordinance is expected to be the first phase of rezoning of that site as a result of the Duwamish Manufacturing/Industrial Center planning effort. The Council is considering further amendments to the zoning for the site but the final terms of such zoning have not been determined or memorialized in a Property Use and Development Agreement ("PUDA"). Because the Council has decided that the rezoning accomplished by this ordinance is preferable to the existing zoning, the Council has decided to rezone the site now while recognizing that additional changes may occur if and when agreement on a PUDA is reached.

 Section 4. The provisions of this ordinance are declared to be separate and severable. The invalidity of any particular provision shall not affect the validity of any other provision.

 Section 5. This ordinance shall take effect and be in force thirty (30) days from and after its approval by the Mayor, but if not approved and returned by the Mayor within ten (10) days after presentation, it shall take effect as provided by Municipal Code Section 1.04.020.

 Passed by the City Council the ___ day of ____________, 2000, and signed by me in open session in authentication of its passage this ___ day of _____________, 2000.
