 AN ORDINANCE relating to drivers with suspended licenses, increasing access to information about obtaining a valid driver license, and transferring expenditure authority from the 2000 Department of Finance General Jail Services budget to the 2000 budget of the Seattle Municipal Court to pay for costs associated with these efforts.

 WHEREAS in 1998 the City Council passed Ordinance 119180 allowing the impoundment of vehicles driven by persons arrested for driving while license suspended or revoked in the first, second, or third degree; and

 WHEREAS an increased effort by the City to assist people with suspended driver licenses in obtaining valid licenses and to assist people receiving traffic citations in responding to those citations would reduce the number of people driving with suspended licenses and thus the number subject to vehicle impounds, fines, and jail; and

 WHEREAS such an effort would not diminish every driver's responsibility to drive safely and meet the legal requirements resulting from driving infractions; and

 WHEREAS in 1999 and 2000 the Seattle Municipal Court and King County District Court convened a Relicensing Summit that identified a wide range of potential actions to ease access to court payment systems and educate citizens on how to resolve traffic infractions; and

 WHEREAS a decline in 1999 and 2000 in the number of persons cited for driving while license suspended (DWLS) has allowed the City to reduce its Jail Services costs below the amount projected in the 1999 and 2000 Adopted Budgets and those savings are expected to continue relative to the 1998 jail costs associated with people cited for DWLS; and

 WHEREAS the Seattle Municipal Court has proposed to contract with one or more community agencies to give persons with suspended driver licenses information about their legal obligations and advise them on how to obtain a valid license, and to create a Relicensing Ombudsperson in the Municipal Court to assist the contractor community agencies and also provide information and advice directly to persons with suspended licenses; and

 WHEREAS the amount required to support such a contract or contracts and to support a Relicensing Ombudsperson is no greater than the expected cost savings in Jail Services; and

 WHEREAS the Seattle Municipal Court is seeking the cooperation of the King County Department of Adult Detention in providing counseling to jail inmates with suspended driver licenses, and of the State Department of Licensing in obtaining information about individuals' legal obligations and driver licenses status;

 NOW, THEREFORE,

 BE IT ORDAINED BY THE CITY OF SEATTLE AS FOLLOWS:

 Section 1. In order to support a six-month pilot project aimed at assisting people in regaining and maintaining valid drivers licenses, the Seattle Municipal Court's expenditure authority is increased as follows:

 Department Fund Program Category Amount

 Seattle Municipal Court 00100 M10 $94,416

 by the appropriation, hereby made and authorized, of the sum of ninety-four thousand four hundred sixteen dollars from the General Subfund. To provide the necessary funds for these expenditures, the appropriation in the 2000 budget of the Department of Finance General for Jail Services (Summit Code Q523600) is reduced by a like amount, and that amount is re-appropriated as set out in this section.

 Section 2. The funds appropriated in Section 1 shall be used to support a pilot project for the remainder of the year 2000. This pilot shall cover the costs of a temporary or contract position in the Seattle Municipal Court, specifically a Relicensing Ombudsperson who shall assist people who have current DWLS obligations with the Seattle Municipal Court and work with community-based organizations with whom the Court may contract for similar counseling, educational, and financial planning services; one-time start-up costs associated with support for such a position/function; and a contract(s) for community- based services to help people in the community at large with DWLS issues.

 Section 3. This ordinance shall take effect and be in force thirty (30) days from and after its approval by the Mayor, but if not approved and returned by the Mayor within ten (10) days after presentation, it shall take effect as provided by Municipal Code 1.04.020.
