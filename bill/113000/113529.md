 AN ORDINANCE relating to Seattle Transportation's Fairview- Valley Corridor Realignment project; making an appropriation of $4,500,000 from the Transportation Operating Fund, and increasing the expenditure authority in the subfund for all the costs related to the acquisition of properties as authorized in Ordinance 120071; and authorizing an interfund loan to support that appropriation; all upon a three-fourths vote of the City Council.

 WHEREAS, Ordinance 120071 authorized the acquisition of certain real property and property rights in the vicinity of Fairview Avenue North and Valley Street; and

 WHEREAS, Ordinance 120071 provided that the cost of the acquisitions, including, but not limited to, the purchase prices, appraisals, environmental site assessments, closing costs, title insurance, protective rents, and relocation benefits to qualified, displaced persons as provided shall be paid from such General Funds of the City of Seattle as may be provided by law; and

 WHEREAS, the City Council, in Ordinance 120165 adopted the 2001 Budget and Capital program, including the Fairview-Valley project in TC365500 and in Ordinance 120169 authorized bonds in the amount of $4,616,000 for this project to be sold in the Summer of 2000; and

 WHEREAS, negotiations to acquire the properties are currently underway, and are expected to conclude before the referenced bond sale; and

 WHEREAS, selling municipal bonds separate from the regular City bond sale planned for the summer of 2001 is not the most cost-effective or timely way to finance the acquisition and related costs for the Fairview-Valley Corridor Realignment project; and

 WHEREAS, the Cumulative Reserve Subfund is intended to support capital improvement projects and has a sufficient fund balance available to loan the project funding to support the acquisition and related costs; and

 WHEREAS, the Cumulative Reserve Subfund will earn market rate interest on the project loan and will be reimbursed at such time as longer-term financing is secured;

 NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT ORDAINED BY THE CITY OF SEATTLE AS FOLLOWS:

 Section 1. To provide for the payment of the costs of the acquisition of the properties in the vicinity of Fairview Avenue North and Valley Street, as identified in Ordinance 120071, the expenditure allowances in the 2001 Budget for Seattle Transportation in the following program category is increased as follows:

 Program Category Summit Code Amount Transportation 18300 $4,500,000 Infrastructure Line of Business

 by the appropriation and transfer of Four Million, Five Hundred Thousand Dollars ($4,500,000) to the appropriate expenditure accounts in the Transportation Operating Fund, from an interfund loan, hereafter authorized, from the Cumulative Reserve Subfund. Unexpended and unencumbered appropriation amounts will carry forward from year to year until fully expended, or abandoned by ordinance.

 Section 2. To support the appropriation made in Section 1, an interfund loan from the Cumulative Reserve Subfund to the Transportation Operating Fund is authorized in the maximum amount of Four Million, Five Hundred Thousand Dollars ($4,500,000) or so much thereof as may be necessary to support the property acquisition and related costs of the Fairview- Valley Corridor Realignment project. The loan shall last no longer than August 31, 2001, unless extended by subsequent ordinance. The Transportation Operating fund shall pay interest to the Cumulative Reserve Subfund on the borrowed funds at a rate that reflects the Cumulative Reserve Subfund's earnings on its other investments. The principal amount of the loan from the Cumulative Reserve Subfund together with interest will be repaid with proceeds from longer-term project funding expected to be obtained by the sale of General Obligation Bonds as provided by Ordinance 120169. Ultimately the net proceeds from the disposition of surplus City land in the South Lake Union neighborhood contemplated in Resolution 30080 and that from any remainders of property parcels to be acquired pursuant to the appropriation in this ordinance shall be used to fully repay the cost of acquiring the property necessary for the Fairview-Valley Corridor Realignment project. The Director of Finance is hereby authorized to execute all necessary interfund loan documents and warrants and to make fund transfers as necessary.

 Section 3. All acts consistent with the authority and prior to the effective date of this ordinance, including expenditures consistent with the purpose of this ordinance, are hereby ratified and confirmed.

 Section 4. The foregoing appropriations are made to meet actual necessary expenditures of the City for which insufficient appropriations have been made due to causes that could not reasonably have been foreseen at the time of the adoption of the 2001 Budget;

 Now, Therefore, in accordance with RCW 35.32A.060, by reason of the facts stated above, this ordinance shall take effect and be in force thirty (30) days from and after its passage and approval, if approved by the Mayor, but if not approved and returned by the Mayor within ten (10) days after presentation, it shall take effect as provided by Municipal Code Section 1.01.020.
