 AN ORDINANCE relating to the impoundment of vehicles, amending Subsections 11.30.105A and 11.30.120B, C and D and Section 11.30.160 of the Seattle Municipal Code.

 WHEREAS in 1998 the City Council passed Ordinance 119180 authorizing the impoundment of vehicles driven by drivers with a suspended or revoked driver's license; and

 WHEREAS an increased effort by the City to assist persons with suspended licenses in obtaining valid licenses and to assist persons receiving traffic citations in responding to those citations would reduce the number of persons driving with suspended licenses and thus the number subject to criminal penalties and the number of vehicles subject to impoundment; and

 WHEREAS such an effort would not diminish every driver's responsibility to drive safely and meet the legal requirements resulting from driving infractions; and

 WHEREAS Ordinance 119180 gave to the Police Department the responsibility for conducting vehicle impoundment hearings, but giving this responsibility to Municipal Court would provide a greater opportunity for drivers with suspended licenses whose vehicles have been impounded to learn about and meet their legal obligations; and

 WHEREAS in adopting Ordinance 119180, the City Council intended the term "arrested" to include drivers temporarily detained and then released by the police upon service of a citation and notice to appear and did not intend to require that as a condition of impounding the vehicle the driver first had to be physically taken into custody and booked into jail for the offense of Driving While License Suspended or Revoked, (SMC 11.56.320 or 11.56.340); and

 WHEREAS the amendment by this ordinance of Subsection 11.30.105A is intended to clarify, and not change, the intended meaning of the term "arrested" used in that subsection; NOW THEREFORE

 BE IT ORDAINED BY THE CITY OF SEATTLE AS FOLLOWS:

 Section 1. Subsection A of Section 11.30.105 of the Seattle Municipal Code (Ordinance 119180 Section 4, part) is amended as follows:

 A. Whenever the driver of a vehicle is arrested for a violation of Section 11.56.320 or 11.56.340, the vehicle is subject to impoundment at the direction of a police officer. For purposes of this subsection, "arrested" includes, but is not limited to, being temporarily detained under Section 12A.02.140B and served with a citation and notice to appear pursuant to Section 12A.02.140C and RCW 46.64.015.

Section 2. Subsections B, C and D of Section 11.30.120 of the Seattle Municipal Code (Ordinance 108200 Section 2 (11.30.120), part, as last amended by Ordinance 119180 Section 5) are further amended as follows:

 11.30.120 Redemption of impounded vehicles.

 Vehicles impounded by the City shall be redeemed only under the following circumstances:

 * * *

 B. Any person so redeeming a vehicle impounded by the City shall pay the towing contractor for costs of impoundment (removal, towing, and storage) and administrative fee prior to redeeming such vehicle. Such towing contractor shall accept payment as provided in RCW 46.55.120(1)(b), as now or hereafter amended. If the vehicle was impounded pursuant to Section 11.30.105 and was being operated by the registered owner when it was impounded, it may not be released to any person until all penalties, fines, or forfeitures owed by the registered owner have been satisfied by payment in full, by establishment of a time payment agreement with the Municipal Court, or by other means acceptable to the Municipal Court.

 C. The Municipal Court~~Chief of Police~~ is authorized to release a vehicle impounded pursuant to Section 11.30.105 prior to the expiration of any period of impoundment upon petition of the spouse of the driver, or the person registered pursuant to Ordinance 117244 as the domestic partner of the driver, based on economic or personal hardship to such spouse or domestic partner resulting from the unavailability of the vehicle and after consideration of the threat to public safety that may result from release of the vehicle, including, but not limited to, the driver's criminal history, driving record, license status, and access to the vehicle. If such release is authorized, the person redeeming the vehicle still must satisfy the requirements of Section 11.30.120 A and B.

 D. Any person seeking to redeem a vehicle impounded as a result of a parking or traffic citation has a right to a hearing before a Municipal Court judicial officer~~an administrative hearings officer~~ to contest the validity of an impoundment or the amount of removal, towing, and storage charges or administrative fee if such request for hearing is in writing, in a form approved by the  Municipal Court~~Chief of Police~~ and signed by such person, and is received by the Municipal Court~~Chief of Police~~ within ten (10) days (including Saturdays, Sundays, and holidays) of the latter of the date the notice was mailed to such person pursuant to Section 11.30.100 A or B, or the date the notice was given to such person by the registered tow truck operator pursuant to RCW 46.55.120(2)(a). Such hearing shall be provided as follows:

 1. If all of the requirements to redeem the vehicle, including expiration of any period of impoundment under Section 11.30.105, have been satisfied, then the impounded vehicle shall be released immediately, and a hearing as provided for in Section 11.30.160 shall be held within ninety (90) days of the written request for hearing.

 2. If not all of the requirements to redeem the vehicle, including expiration of any period of impoundment under Section 11.30.105, have been satisfied, then the impounded vehicle shall not be released until after the hearing provided pursuant to Section 11.30.160, which shall be held within two (2) business days (excluding Saturdays, Sundays and holidays) of the written request for hearing.

 3. Any person seeking a hearing who has failed to request such hearing within the time specified in Section 11.30.120 D may petition the Municipal Court~~Chief of Police~~ for an extension to file a request for hearing. Such extension shall only be granted upon the demonstration of good cause as to the reason(s) the request for hearing was not timely filed. For the purposes of this section, "good cause" shall be defined as circumstances beyond the control of the person seeking the hearing that prevented such person from filing a timely request for hearing. In the event such extension is granted, the person receiving such extension shall be granted a hearing in accordance with this chapter.

 4. If a person fails to file a timely request for hearing and no extension to file such a request has been granted, the right to a hearing is waived, the impoundment and the associated costs of impoundment and administrative fee are deemed to be proper, and the City shall not be liable for removal, towing, and storage charges arising from the impoundment.

 5. In accordance with RCW 46.55.240(1)(d), a decision made by a Municipal Court judicial officer~~an administrative hearings officer~~ may be appealed to Municipal Court for final judgment. The hearing on the appeal under this subsection shall be de novo. A person appealing such a decision must file a request for an appeal in Municipal Court within fifteen (15) days after the decision of the  Municipal Court judicial officer~~administrative hearings officer~~ and must pay a filing fee in the same amount required for the filing of a suit in district court. If a person fails to file a request for an appeal within the time specified by this section or does not pay the filing fee, the right to an appeal is waived and the Municipal Court judicial officer's~~administrative hearings officer's~~ decision is final.

 Section 3. Section 11.30.160 of the Seattle Municipal Code (Ordinance 108200 Section 2 (11.30.160), as last amended by Ordinance 119180 Section 6) is further amended as follows:

 11.30.160 Post-impoundment hearing procedure.

 Hearings requested pursuant to Section 11.30.120 shall be held by a Municipal Court judicial officer~~an administrative hearings officer~~, who shall determine whether the impoundment was proper and whether the associated removal, towing, storage, and administrative fees were proper. The Municipal Court judicial officer~~administrative hearings officer~~ shall not have the authority to determine the commission or mitigation of any parking infraction unless a timely response under Section 11.31.050 A was filed to that notice of infraction requesting a hearing and the hearing date for that infraction has not passed, in which case the  Municipal Court judicial officer~~administrative hearings officer~~ has discretion to consolidate the impoundment hearing and the notice of infraction hearing.

 A. At the hearing, an abstract of the driver's driving record is admissible without further evidentiary foundation and is prima facie evidence of the status of the driver's license, permit, or privilege to drive and that the driver was convicted of each offense shown on the abstract. In addition, a certified vehicle registration of the impounded vehicle is admissible without further evidentiary foundation and is prima facie evidence of the identity of the registered owner of the vehicle.

 B. If the impoundment is found to be proper, the Municipal Court judicial officer~~administrative hearings officer~~ shall enter an order so stating. In the event that the costs of impoundment (removal, towing, and storage) and administrative fee have not been paid or any other applicable requirements of Section 11.30.120 B have not been satisfied or any period of impoundment under Section 11.30.105 has not expired, the Municipal Court judicial officer's ~~administrative hearings officer's~~ order shall also provide that the impounded vehicle shall be released only after payment to the City of any fines imposed on any underlying traffic or parking infraction and satisfaction of any other applicable requirements of Section 11.30.120 B and payment of the costs of impoundment and administrative fee to the towing company and after expiration of any period of impoundment under Section 11.30.105. In the event that the Municipal Court judicial officer~~administrative hearings officer~~ grants time payments for the costs of impoundment and administrative fee, the City shall be responsible for paying the costs of impoundment to the towing company.

 The Municipal Court judicial officer~~administrative hearings officer~~ shall grant such time payments only in cases of extreme financial need, and where there is an effective guarantee of payment.

 C. If the impoundment is found to be improper, the Municipal Court judicial officer~~administrative hearings officer~~ shall enter an order so stating and order the immediate release of the vehicle. If the costs of impoundment and administrative fee have already been paid, the Municipal Court judicial officer~~administrative hearings officer~~ shall enter judgment against the City and in favor of the person who has paid the costs of impoundment and administrative fee in the amount of the costs of the impoundment and administrative fee.

 D. In the event that the Municipal Court judicial officer~~administrative hearings officer~~ finds that the impound was proper, but that the removal, towing, storage, or administrative fees charged for the impoundment were improper, the Municipal Court judicial officer~~administrative hearings officer~~ shall determine the correct fees to be charged. If the costs of impoundment and administrative fee have been paid, the Municipal Court judicial officer~~administrative hearings officer~~ shall enter a judgment against the City and in favor of the person who has paid the costs of impoundment and administrative fee for the amount of the overpayment.

 E. No determination of facts made at a hearing under this section shall have any collateral estoppel effect on a subsequent criminal prosecution and such determination shall not preclude litigation of those same facts in a subsequent criminal prosecution.

 F. An appeal of the Municipal Court judicial officer's~~administrative hearings officer's~~ decision in Municipal Court shall be conducted according to, and is subject to, the procedures of this section. If the court finds that the impoundment or the removal, towing, storage, or administrative fees are improper, any judgment entered against the City shall include the amount of the filing fee.

 Section 4. Should Council Bill 113254 also become an ordinance, then the amendments made by that ordinance and this ordinance to subsection 11.30.120B of the Seattle Municipal Code shall be given full force and effect. Should Council Bill 113113 also become an ordinance, then the amendmentsmade by that ordinance and this ordinance to subsection 11.30.105A of the Seattle Municipal Code shall each be given full force and effect.  Section 5.

 This ordinance shall take effect and be in force thirty (30) days from and after its approval by the Mayor, but if not approved and returned by the Mayor within ten (10) days after presentation, it shall take effect as provided by Municipal Code Section 1.04.020.
