 The Grantor and the COUNTY, by accepting and recording this easement, hereby mutually covenant and agree as follows:

The COUNTY's restoration obligation hereunder shall include and is not limited to the replanting or replacement in kind and size of any landscaping element (e.g., any shrub, tree or lawn area) that is located within the above-described permanent easement area and has been disturbed by any work undertaken by or for the COUNTY, and the COUNTY's ensuring that for a period of not less than one (1) year after such restoration has been completed (the "landscaping maintenance guarantee period"), all landscaping elements that have been replanted or replaced as part of that restoration effort continue to thrive; Provided, that if any such  landscaping element has become diseased or has died during the landscaping maintenance guarantee period, the COUNTY shall replace such landscaping element in kind and size subject to an identical landscaping maintenance guarantee period.

 3. Except for negligence on the part of Grantor, its successors and assigns, COUNTY shall protect and save harmless Grantor and its successors and assigns from any and all claims, demands, loss, damage, expense and liability of every kind and description including personal injury and for any damage to or loss or destruction of property whatsoever suffered by Grantor or any such successors and assigns, or by any person, firm or corporation, because of the construction and/or maintenance of any of said facilities.
