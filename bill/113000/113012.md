 Section 2. At any stage of this Project, any public agency that is not initially a participant in this Project may, if the Chief Technology Officer approves, participate in this Project provided that an agreement that conforms to the principles and terms and conditions of the Project Agreement, as described in Ordinance 117981, is executed, and provided that addition of any such agency does not create additional net cost to the City. Project modifications consistent with the intent of the Project, which may include the addition of elements for public agencies participating in the Project, such as additional building entrances or fiber terminations paid for by the requesting agency or agencies, may proceed provided the budget authorizations (including that made in Section 3 of this ordinance) are sufficient to complete the Project without additional net cost to the City.
