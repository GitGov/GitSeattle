 PMA 95 Ordinance

 July 18, 2001

 version 4

PRELIMINARY REPORT  EVALUATION OF PMA #95 - SOUTH LAKE UNION PARK PLAN

Resolution 29799 directs the Executive to make its recommendations on the reuse or disposal of excess property on a case by case basis, using the Procedures for Evaluation of the Reuse and Disposal of the City's Real Property adopted by that Resolution. Additionally, the Resolution identifies guidelines, which are to be considered in making a recommendation. This report addresses each of the guidelines outlined in Resolution 29799 in support of the recommendation.

Property Management Area: PMA #95 - South Lake Union Park Plan - 815 Boren Avenue N.

 BACKGROUND INFORMATION

Legal Description: Lots 5 through 8, inclusive, and the easterly 60 feet of Lots 1 through 4, inclusive, of Block 74, as shown on the official maps of Lake Union Shore Lands, filed in the office of the Commissioner of Public Lands at Olympia, Washington, July 1st, 1907, situate in King County, State of Washington,

 Subject to the reservations made by the State of Washington.

Physical Description and Related Factors: The site is irregularly shaped, consisting of a 60 foot strip over the easterly portion of Lots 1 through 4 together with all of Lots 5 through 8 of Block 74 of the Lake Union Shorelands plat. King County Assessor information indicates that there are 63,905 square feet in the parcel, of which, approximately 3,120 square feet are under water. The site is basically level with a small portion of the northeast corner submerged in Lake Union. Seattle City Waterway No. 4 is located along the east property line. All public utilities are available to the property.

GUIDELINE A: CONSISTENCY

The analysis should consider the purpose for which the property was originally acquired, funding sources used to acquire the property, terms and conditions of original acquisition, the title or deed conveying the property, or any other contract or instrument by which the City is bound or to which the property is subject, and City, state or federal ordinances, statues and regulations.

 The City acquired the westerly 145.598 feet of Lots 5 to 13, both inclusive, of Block 74 of Lake Union Shore Lands from the State of Washington in 1910, under the authority of Ordinance 24983. That ordinance accepted the deed. Ordinance 33297, dated June 22, 1914, accepted the deed for the east 60 feet of Block 74 of the Lake Union Shore Lands from T. L. Quigley. Research did not reveal a specific ordinance that authorized acquiring the property for a special purpose, although references are made to the use of "general funds." During the period of City ownership, a portion of the property was used by the Seattle Engineering Department as an asphalt plant. The City deeded Lots 9 through 13 to the U. S. Government for a Naval Reserve Armory in 1940, under the authority of Ordinance 70241. Lots 9 through 13 were deeded back to the City pursuant to Ordinance 119944, passed on May 22, 2000. Ordinance 119944 authorized accepting deeds and executing such documents as may be necessary to acquire the Naval Reserve Center from the United States of America.

Guideline B: Compatibility and Suitability

The recommendation should reflect an assessment of the potential for use of the property in support of adopted Neighborhood Plans, as or in support of low-income housing, in support of economic development, in support of affordable housing, for park or open space; in support of Sound Transit Link Light Rail station area development; as or in support of child care facilities, and in support of other priorities reflected in adopted City policies.

Context. The property is located at the south end of Lake Union and is heavily influenced by the South Lake Union Neighborhood Planning Program. In 1991, a master plan was adopted by The City of Seattle for development of a multi-use park at South Lake Union. Although there were some uncertainties in the master plan, the open public process provided clear direction to the types of uses and the environment desired along the southern shore of Lake Union. The South Lake Union Park Master Plan was updated, and as updated, was adopted by the City Council in 2000. The updated plan clarifies the types of uses for the park open space passive uses on the western part of the park and maritime heritage type uses east of the Terry Right of Way. The South Lake Union Planning Committee recommended allowing expansion of the Center for Wooden Boats to occur in Waterway No. 4, including access to the eastern side of the Naval Reserve bulkhead pier. The South Lake Union Neighborhood Plan was adopted in March 1999, with development of the South Lake Union park as the number one priority in the plan. The City, through the Department of Parks and Recreation, supports the community's efforts to expand the Center for Wooden Boats.

Range of Options. Since the property is part of a master plan for development of a multi-use park and contained in the South Lake Union Neighborhood Plan and is currently used for a purpose consistent with the master plan, other options contemplating a reuse of this property were not investigated.

 Guideline C: Other Factors

The recommendation should consider the highest and best use of the property, compatibility of the proposed use with the physical characteristics of the property and with surrounding uses,

 timing and term of the proposed use, appropriateness of the consideration to be received, unique attributes that make the property hard to replace, potential for consolidation with adjacent public property to accomplish future goals and objectives, conditions in the real estate market, and known environmental factors that make affect the value of the property.

 Highest and Best Use

: Generally, the C2-40' zoning designation has a wide range of allowed uses (Light and General Manufacturing uses). The shoreline designation of Urban Stable (US), which has a 30' height limit supercedes the underlying zoning. The parcel is also within the jurisdiction of the Seattle Shoreline Master Program. The most recent appraisal report, covering the property to be transferred to Parks, was submitted by The Eastman Company showing an indicated value of $1,152,000 as of December 15, 1988. No appraisal report for this transfer of jurisdiction is recommended. The current assessed value is $3,196,200.

Compatibility with surrounding uses: This property is wholly compatible with surrounding uses.

Potential for Consolidation with adjacent public property: The purpose for transferring the jurisdiction of this property is to consolidate it with other City property for inclusion into the South Lake Union Park Plan.

Timing and Term of Proposed Use: With the acceptance of the deed for the Naval Reserve Center, it is appropriate that jurisdiction for this property be transferred to the Department of Parks and Recreation in furtherance of the adopted master plan.

 Appropriateness of the consideration: The current fair market value for the site has not been determined as this is a transfer of jurisdiction. No funding is involved in this transfer of jurisdiction from Fleets and Facilities Department to the Department of Parks and Recreation.

Known environmental factors: There are no known clean-up or other remedial treatment indicated for the property covered by this transfer.

Guideline D: Sale

The recommendation should evaluate the potential for selling the property to non-City public entities and to members of the general public.

 Given that the South Lake Union Neighborhood Plan places a high priority on incorporating this property into the South Lake Union Park Plan, it would not be in the best interest of the City to recommend selling the property for any other use.

RECOMMENDATION

 The Fleets and Facilities Department and the Department of Parks and Recreation jointly recommend that the jurisdiction for this property be transferred from the Fleets and Facilities Department to the Department of Parks and Recreation.
