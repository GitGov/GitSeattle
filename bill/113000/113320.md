 AN ORDINANCE relating to land use and zoning; amending Seattle Municipal Code Section 23.47.012 to allow, as a special exception, specific commercial properties in the South Lake Union Neighborhood to increase their maximum structure height from forty (40) feet to sixty five (65) feet.

 WHEREAS, encouraging redevelopment of properties in the Mercer Corridor is a high priority of the Mayor and Council; and

 WHEREAS, the South Lake Union Neighborhood Plan, adopted by City Council in March 1999, encourages redevelopment of properties in the Mercer Corridor area. The neighborhood plan recognizes that there is a need to review existing zoning to determine if any aspects of the code that may need refinement to reflect planning goals, such as parking requirements, affordability, setbacks, height limits, and allowing compatible cultural uses in the area; and

 WHEREAS, the three blocks between Valley and Mercer Streets and Westlake and Fairview Avenues act as an important transition zone that connects the neighborhood with South Lake Union Park in terms of pedestrian connections, view corridors, types of uses, and architecture; and

 WHEREAS, in the spring of 1999, the City and the South Lake Union Planning Committee hired consultants to evaluate development opportunities on the three blocks between Valley and Mercer Streets and Westlake and Fairview Avenues. The analyses show that there are potential benefits to allowing some or all new uses to be compatible with heights in the surrounding zones, which could yield improved public open space, and design and parking opportunities; and

 WHEREAS, while it is possible to individually redevelop these properties at current height limits, and without any land assembly, real estate and urban design analyses show that there are potentially greater opportunities for public open space and other public amenities, public parking accommodation with accessible weekend and evening public parking, site circulation, design coherence, and integration with park development across Valley Street, if the three blocks between Valley and Mercer Streets and Westlake and Fairview Avenues are developed as an integrated development plan at heights compatible with surrounding zoning; and

 WHEREAS, in December of 1999, the City Council adopted Resolution 30080, which concurs with the consultants' analysis and lays out public objectives for redevelopment of the three block area; and

 NOW THEREFORE,

 BE IT ORDAINED BY THE CITY OF SEATTLE AS FOLLOWS:

 Section 1. Section 23.47.012 of the Seattle Municipal Code, which Section was last amended by Ordinance 119370, is amended as follows:

 23.47.012 Structure height and floor area ratio.

 ***

C. Additional Height Permitted. Within the area bounded by Valley and Mercer Streets and Westlake and Fairview Avenues North, maximum structure height may be increased from forty (40) feet to sixty-five (65) feet as a special exception pursuant to Chapter 23.76, Procedures for Master Use Permits and Council Land Use Decisions. In order to grant the special exception, the Director must find that all of the following criteria are met:

1. The lot is not located within the shoreline district. However, if a lot is located partially within the shoreline district, those portions of that lot which are not in the shoreline district may be eligible for the special exception.

2. In order to reduce potential height, bulk and scale and view impacts, enhance pedestrian connections across Valley and Mercer Streets, and provide greater opportunities for public open space, the following development standards must apply:

a. A minimum of twenty (20) percent of the total development area must be provided as useable open space at street level. The useable open space must be directly accessible to the public during the hours of operation of South Lake Union Park, and no occupied portion of the structure may extend into the required useable open space.

b. If the Director determines that greater public benefit will result, a portion of the required useable open space may be located above street level, provided the following criteria are met:

(1) A minimum of twenty five (25) percent of the total development area is provided as useable open space.

(2) The useable open space is directly accessible to the public during the hours of operation of South Lake Union Park, and no occupied portion of the structure may extend into the required useable open space.

(3) The useable open space enhances visual and physical pedestrian connection(s) between South Lake Union Park and the development area.

(4) The required useable open space is provided at heights less than forty (40) feet, measured from existing or finished grade, whichever is lower.

c. If the Director determines that greater public benefit will result, a portion of the required useable open space may be located below street level, provided the criteria listed in this subsection are met. When useable open space is provided below street level, the height of facades that abut the useable open space shall be measured from existing grade.

(1) A minimum of twenty five (25) percent of the total development area is provided as useable open space.

(2) The useable open space is directly accessible to the public during the hours of operation of South Lake Union Park, and no occupied portion of the structure may extend into the required useable open space.

(3) The useable open space enhances the pedestrian connection(s) between South Lake Union Park and the development area.

(4) The useable open space provides visual and physical connections from street level to the useable open space. Required useable open space allows for ease of access to pedestrians from street level and may include streetscape elements such as semi-transparent fencing and low-level vegetation.

(5) The design and siting of the required useable open space provides adequate light and air exposure and encourages lively pedestrian activity.

d. All portions of a structure that exceed forty (40) feet in height are limited to a maximum lot coverage of sixty-four (64) percent. In addition, portions of a structure above forty (40) feet in height must be located at least fifteen (15) feet from the street property line along Valley Street and Westlake, Terry, Boren, and Fairview Avenues North.

e. Departures from development standards may be granted pursuant to Chapter 23.41, Design Review, except for open space quantity or upper level lot coverage requirements in this Section.

3. In buildings constructed under permits applied for after the effective date of this ordinance, all uses at street level, except for parking, must have a minimum floor to floor height of thirteen (13) feet. Along Terry Avenue North between Valley and Mercer Streets and along Valley Street between Westlake and Boren Avenues North, the following standards apply:

a. A minimum of eighty (80) percent of a structure's street front faade at street level must be occupied by uses other than parking. For purposes of calculating the eighty (80) percent, twenty-two (22) feet for the width of a driveway to access parking may be subtracted from the length of the street front faade if the Director determines that access to parking from Valley Street or Terry Avenue North is the best opportunity to avoid traffic problems or pedestrian conflicts.

b. A minimum depth of thirty (30) feet from the street front faade of the structure must be occupied by uses other than parking. The minimum required depth may be averaged, with no depth less than fifteen (15) feet.

c. If the street front faade and depth requirements result in a space greater than fifty (50) percent of the structure's footprint, the Director may modify the street front faade and depth requirements to reduce the space to fifty (50) percent of the structure's footprint.

~~C.~~ D. Exemptions From FAR Calculations. The following areas shall be exempted from FAR calculations:

 1. All gross floor area below grade;

 2. All gross floor area used for accessory parking.

~~D.~~ E. Split Zoned Lots. When a lot is subject to more than one (1) height and FAR limit, the height and FAR limits for each zone shall apply to the portion of the lot located in that zone.

~~E.~~ F. Sloped Lots. On sloped lots, additional height shall be permitted along the lower elevation of the structure footprint, at the rate of one (1) foot for each six (6) percent of slope, to a maximum additional height of five (5) feet (Exhibit 23.47.012 A).

~~F.~~ G. Pitched Roofs. The ridge of pitched roofs may extend up to five (5) feet above the maximum height limit in zones with height limits of thirty (30) or forty (40) feet. All parts of the roof above the height limit shall be pitched at a rate of not less than three to twelve (3:12)(Exhibit 23.47.012 B). No portion of a shed roof shall be permitted to extend beyond the height limit under this provision.

~~G.~~ H. Rooftop Features.

 1. Radio and television receiving antennas excluding dish antennas; ham radio towers; smokestacks;~~,~~ chimneys; flagpoles; and religious symbols for religious institutions are exempt from height controls, except as regulated in Chapter 23.64, Airport Height Overlay District, provided they are a minimum often (10) feet from any side or rear lot line.

 2. Open railings, planters, skylights, clerestories, greenhouses, parapets and firewalls may extend up to four (4) feet above the maximum height limit with unlimited rooftop coverage.

 3. Solar Collectors.

 a. In zones with height limits of (30) thirty or forty (40) feet, solar collectors may extend up to four (4) feet above the maximum height limit, with unlimited rooftop coverage.

 b. In zones with height limits of sixty-five (65) feet or more, solar collectors may extend up to seven (7) feet above the maximum height limit, with unlimited rooftop coverage.

 4. The following rooftop features may extend up to fifteen (15) feet above the maximum height limit, so long as the combined total coverage of all features listed in this subsection does not exceed twenty (20) percent of the roof area or twenty-five (25) percent of the roof area if the total includes stair or elevator penthouses or screened mechanical equipment:

 a. Solar collectors;

 b. Stair and elevator penthouses;

 c. Mechanical equipment;

 d. Play equipment and open-mesh fencing which encloses it, so long as the fencing is at least fifteen (15) feet from the roof edge; and

 e. Dish antennas, according to the provisions of Chapter 23.57.

 5. In order to protect solar access for property to the north, the applicant shall either locate the rooftop features listed in this subsection at least ten (10) feet from the north edge of the roof, or provide shadow diagrams to demonstrate that the proposed location of such rooftop features would shade property to the north on January 21st at noon no more than would a structure built to maximum permitted bulk:

 a. Solar collectors;

 b. Planters;

 c. Clerestories;

 d. Greenhouses;

 e. Dish antennas, according to the provisions of Chapter 23.57;

 f. Non-firewall parapets;

~~H.~~ I. Solar Retrofits. The Director may permit the retrofitting of solar collectors on conforming or nonconforming structures existing on June 9,1986 as a special exception pursuant to Chapter 23.76, Procedures for Master Use Permits and Council Land Use Decisions. Such a retrofit may be permitted even if it exceeds established height limits, if the following conditions are met:

 1. There is no feasible alternative solution to placing the collector(s)on the roof;

 2. The positioning of such collector(s) minimizes view blockage and shading of property to the north, while still providing adequate solar access for the collectors; and

 3. Such collector(s) meet minimum energy standards administered by the Director.

~~I.~~ J. Television Receiving Antennas. The maximum height of television receiving antennas, except for dish antennas, shall be no more than fifty (50) feet in zones where the maximum height limit does not exceed fifty (50) feet. In zones with a maximum height limit which exceeds fifty (50) feet the maximum height of the antenna shall not exceed the maximum height allowed for all structures.

~~J.~~ K. Height Exceptions for Public Schools.

 1. For new public school construction on new public school sites, the maximum permitted height shall be the maximum height permitted in the zone.

 2. For new public school construction on existing public school sites, the maximum permitted height shall be the maximum height permitted in the zone or thirty-five (35) feet plus fifteen (15) feet for a pitched roof, whichever is greater.

 3. For additions to existing public schools on existing public school sites, the maximum height permitted shall be the maximum height permitted in the zone, the height of the existing school, or thirty-five (35) feet plus fifteen (15) feet for a pitched roof, whichever is greater.

 4. Development standard departure for structure height may be granted or required pursuant to the procedures and criteria set forth in Chapter23.79. For construction of new structures on new and existing public school sites to the extent not otherwise permitted outright, maximum height which may be granted as a development standard departure in zones with height limits of thirty (30) or forty (40) feet shall be thirty-five (35) feet plus fifteen (15) feet for a pitched roof for elementary schools and sixty (60) feet plus fifteen (15) feet for a pitched roof for secondary schools. All height maximums may be waived by the Director when waiver would con-tribute to reduced demolition of residential structures.

 5. To qualify for the pitched roof exception, all parts of the roof above the height limit must be pitched at a rate of not less than three to twelve (3:12). No portion of a shed roof shall extend above the height limit under this provision.
