 AN ORDINANCE relating to Seattle Public Utilities; authorizing Seattle's participation in an Agreement between Seattle, Tacoma, Kent, Covington Water District and the Lakehaven Utility District providing for the development and the operation by Tacoma of a water supply project known as the Second Supply Project.

 WHEREAS, the City of Seattle's ability to meet its mission and statutory responsibilities as the water supplier to the greater Seattle metropolitan area requires ongoing development of reliable, long-term water supply sources to complement the ongoing development and implementation of water conservation measures; and

 WHEREAS, the City of Tacoma has been working in conjunction with Seattle and South King County cities and water districts over the past 15 years to develop a proposal for a regional water supply project that would be capable of providing water supply and environmental benefits to both King and Pierce counties; and

 WHEREAS, Seattle's participation in the proposed Second Supply Project Agreement would provide for:

 * A flexible and reliable new source of water supply to meet the future needs of Seattle's current and future water supply customers in a manner that targets peak demands;

 * The development of a transmission system for this new source of supply that will link the Seattle, South King County and Tacoma supply systems, and in so doing open up new opportunities for Seattle to participate in cost-effective conservation measures to supplement supplies from this and other projects;

 * A water resource strengthening Seattle's ability to both enhance flows on the Cedar River in dry years and lessening the likelihood of a water supply shortage in these dry years;

 * Supply and transmission tools that will create opportunities to address emergent fish needs in streams tributary to the Tolt, Cedar and Green River mainstems within the Seattle system service area;

 * A mutual aid pact between Tacoma and Seattle in the event of a major pipeline failure or seismic event; and

 WHEREAS, the City of Seattle has been working with the City of Tacoma, the City of Kent, the Lakehaven Utility District and the Covington Water District since 1992 to develop a Second Supply Project proposal in a manner that achieves these benefits for Seattle, while affording the regional benefits sought by all of the potential parties to this proposed agreement; and

 WHEREAS, agreement on the terms of the proposed Second Supply Project Agreement was reached by all the parties on November 3rd of 1999, in support of project construction commencing in early 2001; and

 WHEREAS, the City of Seattle has completed an environmental review process under SEPA examining the potential environmental impacts of Seattle's decision to participate in the Second Supply Project Agreement as compared with the potential environmental impacts of developing five water supply alternatives (including increased conservation beyond the system-wide 1% conservation measures currently being implemented) and a "no action" alternative; and

 WHEREAS, the Council has reviewed the Final Environmental Impact Statement (FEIS) prepared in connection with the proposal that Seattle enter into the proposed Second Supply Project Agreement and has fully considered the potential environmental impacts of that action as described in the FEIS documents; and

 WHEREAS, further project-specific environmental review will be carried out by Tacoma in connection with project construction and pipeline routing alternatives; and

 WHEREAS, it is now necessary to take those actions needed to ensure that Seattle's future water supply commitments for both people and fish can be met through a combination of existing supply sources, conservation and Seattle's participation the Tacoma Second Supply project, Now, Therefore,

 BE IT ORDAINED BY THE CITY OF SEATTLE AS FOLLOWS:

 Section 1. The Director of Seattle Public Utilities is hereby authorized to execute on behalf of the City of Seattle the proposed Second Supply Project Agreement in substantially the same form as the final draft agreement attached hereto as Exhibit A.

 2. The cost of the Project Master Meter will be charged to the Project. The cost of individual connections and meters, vaults and associated equipment will be charged to the applicable project participant.
