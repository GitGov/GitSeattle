 WHEREAS, the City Council held a public hearing on February 8, 2000, and there heard testimony regarding the potential for cruelty to exotic animals when such animals are displayed and also heard testimony regarding the potential for danger to the public arising from the display of such animals; and

 WHEREAS, exotic animals have unique and specific biological requirements, best met in their natural habitats, and such requirements are frequently neglected when such animals are displayed to the public; and

 WHEREAS, when exotic animals are kept in captivity and displayed to the public, they are often exposed to unsuitable and cruel conditions; and

 WHEREAS, exotic animals have, on specific occasions, when displayed in other cities, inflicted severe injuries or death upon humans; and
