 AN ORDINANCE relating to the Queen Anne Greenbelt-Land Slide Repair Project; appropriating funds from the Emergency Subfund to pay for the Department of Parks and Recreation's costs of continuing work on the project, all upon a three-fourths vote of the City Council.

 WHEREAS, the soils in the slope area between the 1700 and 1900 blocks of Aurora Avenue North have been moving since late winter, 2000 and an emergency was declared by the Executive Services Department (Finance Department) on August 24, 2000; and

 WHEREAS, a designer and contractor were brought on board and the contractor working with the consultant provided an estimate of the cost of the project on September 13, 2000; and

 WHEREAS, pricing and additional contingencies for the project were developed into the original budget amount of Eight Hundred Forty Thousand, Five Hundred Ninety-Eight Dollars ($840,598); and

 WHEREAS, in November 2000 Ordinance 120180 (Section 26) appropriated the sum of Eight Hundred Forty Thousand, Six Hundred Dollars ($840,600) from the Emergency Account of the Emergency Subfund, all as part of Capital Improvement Program K721003, to pay for emergency work on the west side of Aurora Avenue at approximately the 1700 to 1900 blocks (Queen Anne Greenbelt-Land Slide Repair Project) made necessary by water-induced soil instability and sliding, which could present a danger to people driving on Aurora; and

 WHEREAS, the Department of Parks and Recreation's 2000 Capital Improvement Program expenditure authority was correspondingly increased; and

 WHEREAS, the original construction contract was required by the Executive Services Department to be a force account (time and material) contract due to the process of designing while constructing; and

 WHEREAS, the cost estimates changed as the design progressed, while the pricing changed as the site conditions were exposed and caused additional construction modifications; and

 WHEREAS, the pricing on the ballast rock for fill behind the retaining wall assumed that the original supplier's rock would meet the specifications for strength; and

 WHEREAS, the City of Seattle's material lab determined that the original supplier's rock did not meet fracture strength requirements; and

 WHEREAS, the only rock that would meet the specifications for strength was more expensive and came from a quarry southeast of Tacoma, thereby increasing project expenses; and

 WHEREAS, other changes to the work that increased the project's total price to $1,267,238 included increasing the wall height, adding tiebacks, cleaning up several small slides that occurred during construction, developing a pre-cast concrete section over the H piles, and adding drill casings on the tie backs due to poor soils; and

 WHEREAS, current project activities include the review of manufacturer drawings to determine the most favorable price for cladding; and

 WHEREAS, the City Budget Office affirms that there are sufficient funds and recommends the use of the Emergency Account to pay for this project;

 NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT ORDAINED BY THE CITY OF SEATTLE AS FOLLOWS:

 Section 1. As requested by the Superintendent of the Department of Parks and Recreation and recommended by the Mayor, in addition to the amounts appropriated in Ordinance 120180, to pay for slide prevention in the 1700 to 1900 blocks on the west side of Aurora Avenue North, the amount of Four Hundred Twenty-Six Thousand, Six Hundred Dollars ($426,600) is hereby appropriated from the General Fund, Emergency Subfund, Emergency Account (#00185) to fund the Queen Anne Greenbelt-Land Slide Repair Project (Capital Improvement Program Project K732131).The Superintendent of the Department of Parks and Recreation, or his authorized representative, is hereby authorized to enter into such agreements with other City departments, governments, private organizations, firms, and individuals as are necessary to carry out said improvements.

 Section 2. Any act consistent with the authority and prior to the effective date of this ordinance is hereby ratified and confirmed.

 Section 3. The foregoing appropriation is made to meet actual necessary expenditures of the City for which insufficient appropriation has been made due to causes which could not reasonably have been foreseen at the time of making the 2001 Budget.
