 ORDINANCE __________________

 AN ORDINANCE relating to land use and zoning, adding the Building Code definition of on-premises signs to Section 23.84.036 of the Land Use Code, Seattle Municipal Code Title 23.

 WHEREAS, chapter 23.55 of the Land Use Code follows the general model for sign regulation approved by the United States Supreme Court in City of San Diego v. Metromedia, 453 U.S. 490 (1981); and

 WHEREAS, consistent with that model the City has determined that to promote traffic safety and aesthetics signs should not be allowed because they contribute to traffic hazards and visual blight; and

 WHEREAS, consistent with that model the City has determined that to promote the economic welfare of the City an exception should be made only for signs relating to activities occurring on the site where the sign is located; and

 WHEREAS, consistent with protecting First Amendment rights the City allows non-commercial messages either to be substituted for commercial messages on any lawful sign or to be added to any lawful sign, as stated in the definition of on-premises sign in the Building Code; and

 WHEREAS, the term "on-premises sign" used in the Land Use Code SMC chapter 23.55 is defined in the Building Code, and it will assist the public to include this definition in the Land Use Code;

 NOW THEREFORE, BE IT ORDAINED BY THE CITY OF SEATTLE AS FOLLOWS:

 Section 1. Section 23.84.036 of the SMC, which Section was last amended by Ordinance 119391, is hereby amended as follows:

"Sign, on-premises" means a sign or sign device used solely by the business establishment on the lot where the sign is located which displays either (1) commercial messages which are strictly applicable only to a use of the premises on which it is located, including signs or sign devices indicating the business transacted, principal services rendered, goods sold or produced on the premises, name of the business, and name of the person, firm or corporation occupying the premises or (2) noncommercial messages. This definition shall not include signs located within a structure except those signs oriented so as to be visible through a window."

 Section 2. This ordinance shall take effect and be in force thirty (30) days from and after its approval by the Mayor, but if not approved and returned by the Mayor within ten (10) days after presentation, it shall take effect as provided by Municipal Code Section 1.04.020.

 Passed by the City Council the _____ day of _______________, 2000, and signed by me in open session in authentication of its passage this _____ day of _______________, 2000.
