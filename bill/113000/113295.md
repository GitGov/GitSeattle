 ORDINANCE ____________

 AN ORDINANCE relating to the Department of Parks and Recreation; authorizing the Superintendent to proceed with consideration of planning options for the development of a new aquarium facility and waterfront park in the area covered by the Central Waterfront Master Plan; making appropriations from the Unrestricted Subaccount of the Cumulative Reserve Subfund Capital Projects Account and from the Shoreline Park Improvement Fund; all by a three-fourths vote of the City Council.

 WHEREAS, on January 27, 1997, the Seattle City Council adopted the Central Waterfront Master Plan through Council Resolution #29423, which provided a conceptual physical plan for The Aquarium, Waterfront Park, and Piers 62 and 63; and

 WHEREAS, the Master Plan was based on the recommendations of a Citizen Advisory Committee that the City reconfigure Waterfront Park to create more inviting and usable public access to the waterfront, a stronger physical connection to The Aquarium and open space for civic events and Aquarium programs; and

 WHEREAS, a goal of the Master Plan is to create, in phases, a new Waterfront Park by incorporating The Aquarium, the existing Waterfront Park and Piers 62 and 63 into a single larger park which provides improved public access to the water, open space for both general use and special events, and viewing areas of Elliott Bay; and

 WHEREAS, the Master Plan provides alternatives for the ultimate creation of a single unified space combining Pier 59 and the current Waterfront Park, capable of handling concerts and other major events as well as providing public open space for general use and views of Elliott Bay; and

 WHEREAS, alternative concept designs for development of the new park and aquarium facility were evaluated in a Programmatic Environmental Impact Statement completed in February of 1996; and

 WHEREAS, the Seattle City Council has approved funding to be used, along with private funds raised by the Seattle Aquarium Society, to begin designing the new Aquarium facility in the 2000 Budget as part of the Department of Parks and Recreation 2000-2005 Capital Improvement Program; and

 WHEREAS, the City of Seattle and the Seattle Aquarium Society have agreed to examine planning options for the development of a new aquarium facility and public parks and open space for possible inclusion in the adopted Central Waterfront Master Plan;

 NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT ORDAINED BY THE CITY OF SEATTLE AS FOLLOWS:

 Section 1. As requested by the Superintendent of the Department of Parks and Recreation and recommended by the Mayor, the Superintendent is authorized to proceed with a contract with

 professional consultants to examine planning options for the development of a new aquarium facility and waterfront park for possible inclusion in the City's Central Waterfront Master Plan as part of CIP Program K72465. For such purposes, the Sum of One Hundred Fifty Thousand Dollars ($150,000) is hereby appropriated from the Cumulative Reserve Subfund, Capital Projects Account, Unrestricted Subaccount (Fund 00164) and the Sum of Fifty Thousand Dollars ($50,000) is hereby appropriated from the Shoreline Park Improvement Fund. The 2000 Capital Budget of the Department of Parks and Recreation is increased accordingly. The Superintendent of the Department of Parks and Recreation, or his authorized representative, is hereby authorized to enter into such agreements with other City departments, governments, private organizations, firms, and individuals as are necessary to carry out the examination of an alternative design approach. .

 Section 2. Any act consistent with the authority and prior to the effective date of this ordinance is hereby ratified and confirmed.

 Section 3. The foregoing appropriation is made to meet actual necessary expenditures of the City for which insufficient appropriation has been made due to causes which could not reasonably have been foreseen at the time of making the 2000 Budget.
