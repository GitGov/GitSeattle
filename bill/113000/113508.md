 Between

 The City of Seattle

 and

 The Inn at the Center, LLC

 This Ground Lease is made as of this ___ day of _______, 1999, by and between THE CITY OF SEATTLE, a municipal corporation of the State of Washington (the "City"), acting through its Seattle Center Director ("Director"), and THE INN AT THE CENTER, LLC (the "Inn"), a Washington limited liability company.

 1. PREMISES.

 Subject to the terms and conditions set forth herein, the City leases to the Inn the property depicted on the attached Exhibit A and legally described on Exhibit B, which are hereby incorporated by reference. The property described above is referred to herein as the "Premises."

 2. USE.

 During the term of this Ground Lease, the Inn shall construct or install on the Premises and maintain, operate and hold title to a building together with related facilities and improvements for the primary purpose of operating a limited service first class hotel of not more than 159 rooms, together with all necessary or incidental activities reasonably related thereto (the "Hotel"). Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Inn shall be permitted to construct and/or operate only a limited service restaurant on the Premises. The restaurant shall not be a destination restaurant, shall have no exterior signage, and shall not be permitted to operate with a Class H liquor license unless the Inn obtains the consent of the Experience Music Project therefor. The number of seats for the restaurant shall not exceed seventy-five (75).

 Throughout the term of this Ground Lease, the Inn shall operate the Hotel pursuant to a current franchise agreement with an established franchiser of limited service first class hotels and shall make a copy of its current franchise agreement available to the Director upon request.

 The improvements to be constructed pursuant to this Ground Lease are referred to herein as the "Hotel Improvements". The Hotel Improvements shall include any and all fixtures, furnishings, equipment and other items of personal property that are used or necessary to generally operate the above-referenced Hotel and any discrete systems and elements of the foregoing (e.g., HVAC, electrical, water, sewer, humidity controls, elevators, security, telephones, fire alarms, sprinklers and fire suppression devices, security, public address systems, and signage). The Hotel Improvements shall also include the City Parking Facility, as further described in Subsection 9.1, below. The cost of construction of the Hotel Improvements shall not be less than $10,000,000.

 During the term of this Ground Lease and any extension or renewal thereof, the Inn shall not use or permit the Premises, any part thereof or any part of the Hotel Improvements to be used for any purpose other than those set forth above except with the consent of the Director, or in any manner that will disturb or injure the owner, occupants or tenants of any adjoining property.

 3. TERM.

 The initial term of this Ground Lease shall be forty (40) years, commencing on __________, and ending at midnight, ________, 20_ ("Initial Term"), unless sooner terminated as provided in this Ground Lease. Upon the agreement of the parties, and provided the Inn is not in default of any of its obligations hereunder at the expiration of the Initial Term, this Ground Lease may be extended for two additional fifteen (15)-year periods ("Extended Terms") upon the terms and conditions contained herein. The Inn shall notify the City, in writing, of its desire to extend the term of this Ground Lease not later than one (1) year prior to expiration of the Initial Term and the first Extended Term, if applicable.

 Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, this Ground Lease shall be null and void and of no further force and effect unless the Inn has commenced construction of the Hotel Improvements, as defined in Subsection 10.11, below, no later than sixty (60) days after the Inn's receipt of all necessary permits and approvals for construction or December 31, 2000, whichever occurs first. In such event, the Inn shall restore the Premises to their original condition in accordance with Subsection 10.15 if the same have been altered in any way.

 4. CONSTRUCTION FINANCING.

 Prior to commencement of any construction on the Premises, the Inn shall demonstrate to the Director's satisfaction that the Inn has secured one or more binding commitments for the financing of one hundred percent (100%) of the anticipated construction cost of the Hotel Improvements by delivering to the Director for review, a copy of every agreement and document creating any loan or line or letter of credit therefor. The Inn's failure to provide documentation of construction financing as required by this Section 4 shall render this Ground Lease null and void and of no further force and effect, and the Inn shall restore the Premises to their original condition in accordance with Subsection 10.15 of this Ground Lease if the same have been altered in any way.

 5. POSSESSION AND OCCUPANCY.

 Upon the commencement of the Initial Term of this Ground Lease, the Inn shall have possession and use of and may construct the Hotel Improvements on the Premises, subject to the rights reserved by the City herein. The Inn shall not, however, occupy any of the Hotel Improvements until it has obtained a certificate of occupancy therefor.

 6. RENT.

 6.1. Initial Term. Subject to the provisions of Subsection 6.6, below, the initial Annual Rent for the Inn's occupation and use of the Premises, which the Inn agrees to pay the City without deduction or offset, shall be the Fair Market Rate of Return for the Premises multiplied by the appraised Fair Market Value of the Premises. The parties agree that the initial Fair Market Rate of Return shall be eight and 1/2 percent (8.5%)of the appraised Fair Market Value of the Premises and that for the first year of this Ground Lease, the Annual Rent, based upon an independent appraisal, would be $204,000 were the Hotel constructed to the height and according to the elevations presented to the City's Culture, Arts and Parks Committee on October 13, 1999 and containing a maximum of 195 units. The parties agree that upon execution of this Ground Lease the Premises shall be promptly reappraised and the Fair Market Value of the Premises shall be adjusted to reflect restrictions imposed by the City upon the design and development of the Hotel since October 13, 1999, to the extent relevant to a determination of Fair Market Value. Within thirty (30) days of the receipt of such reappraisal, the City shall reimburse the Inn for any overpayment of the Good Faith Deposit described in Section 8 or any overpayment of prepaid Annual Rent. The cost of any such reappraisal shall be shared equally by the parties.

 6.1.1. The Annual Rent shall be adjusted upward each year on the anniversary of the commencement date of this Ground Lease (each, a "Rent Adjustment Date") to reflect increases in the total noncompounded percentage change in the Consumer Price Index for all Urban Consumers in the Seattle-Tacoma-Bremerton Metropolitan Area ("CPI"), as published by the U.S. Department of Labor, Bureau of Labor Statistics for the preceding twelve months. The City shall notify the Inn in writing at least two (2) months prior to each Rent Adjustment Date of the new Annual Rent amount that will be due starting on such Rent Adjustment Date. By way of example only, if the CPI on the commencement date of this Ground Lease is 100 and the CPI two months prior to the Rent Adjustment Date is 110 and the annual rent due under this Ground Lease immediately prior to the Rent Adjustment Date is $100,000, then the total CPI adjustment would be 10% and annual rent under this Ground Lease would increase  to $110,000 effective as of the Rent Adjustment Date. If the CPI two months prior to the second annual Rent Adjustment Date is 107 and the annual rent due under this Ground Lease immediately prior to the second Rent Adjustment Date is $110,000, then the total CPI adjustment would be 7% and annual rent under this Ground Lease would increase to $117,700 effective as of the Rent Adjustment Date. In the event the CPI is discontinued, the parties shall agree upon another similar index to be used to calculate the contemplated adjustments, and in the event of an inability to agree, the parties shall request the American Arbitration Association or its successor to appoint a qualified arbitrator to establish an appropriate adjustment standard.

 6.1.2. There shall be an option exercisable one time for each two and one-half (2 1/2) year period commencing ____________, 20__, and every two and one-half (2 1/2) years thereafter during the Initial and any Extended Term to have the fair market value of the Premises reappraised (the "Reappraisal Option"). Either the City or the Inn may exercise the Reappraisal Option for any of the two and one-half (2 1/2) year periods specified above, subject to the following limitations: (a) the applicable Reappraisal Option for a two and one-half (2 1/2) year period may only be exercised during such two and one-half (2 1/2) year period and the one (1) year immediately prior to such two and one-half (2 1/2) year period, (b) once one party has exercised the applicable Reappraisal Option for a two and one-half (2 1/2) year period, neither party shall have any further rights to exercise a Reappraisal Option during such two and one-half (2 1/2) year period. Subject to the foregoing limitations, a party can exercise a Reappraisal Option by simply delivering written notice of its exercise of the Reappraisal Option to the other party. Upon delivery of the exercise notice, the parties shall proceed to obtain the Fair Market Value of the Premises (each, a "Reappraisal Date") in the manner described in Subsection 6.5, below. Said reappraisal shall be the Fair Market Value for the purpose of computing the Annual Rent until the next Reappraisal Date or until the Initial Term or any Extended Term expires.

 6.1.3. In addition to the reappraisal of Fair Market Value described in Subsection 6.1.2, the City shall have an option exercisable one time for each fifteen (15)-year period commencing ____________, 20__, and every fifteen (15) years thereafter while this Ground Lease is in effect, to have the Current Fair Market Rate of Return for the Premises reappraised. Reappraisals to determined the Current Fair Market Rate of Return shall be at the City's sole expense provided the parties mutually agree upon a single appraiser. If the City and the Inn cannot agree upon one appraiser, then the procedures for selection of appraisers described in Subsection 6.5, including the allocation of costs therefor, shall apply.

 6.2. Extended Terms. The Annual Rent for the Inn's occupation and use of the Premises throughout the Extended Terms shall be then- Current Fair Market Rate of Return multiplied by the then-current Fair Market Value of the land subject to this Ground Lease as of the commencement date of each Extended Term. The City and the Inn shall obtain an appraisal according to the terms of this Ground Lease in order to determine the Current Fair Market Rate of Return and the current Fair Market Value of the Premises prior to the commencement of an Extended Term.

 6.3. Fair Market Value. The term "Fair Market Value" of the land shall mean the price that a commercially-reasonable purchaser, who is willing but not obligated to purchase the land, would be willing to pay for the land in an unimproved state to an owner willing but not obligated to sell it, taking into consideration all uses for which the land was suited and might be applied, any restrictions imposed by the City, and assuming the land was owned by a private seller and contained 28,838 square feet.

 6.4. Fair Market Rate of Return. The term "Fair Market Rate of Return" shall mean the rental income that a property would most probably command in the open market, indicated by current rents paid and asked for comparable land as of the date of the appraisal.

 6.5. Selection of Qualified Appraiser and Allocation of Appraisal Costs. When an appraisal of the Premises is required by the terms of this Ground Lease, the City and the Inn shall attempt to agree, by the date one hundred fifty (150) days prior to the Reappraisal Date or commencement of the Extended Term, on one qualified appraiser who will determine the Fair Market Value of the land and the Fair Market Rate of Return, if applicable. If the City and the Inn cannot mutually agree upon an appraiser, then one qualified appraiser shall be appointed by the Inn and one qualified appraiser shall be appointed by the City within fifteen (15) days of notice by one party to the other of such disagreement. In such a case, the Inn shall be solely responsible for the fees of the Inn's appointed appraiser, and the City shall be solely responsible for the fees the City's appointed appraiser. The two qualified appraisers shall determine the Fair Market Value of the land and, if applicable, the Fair Market Rate of Return; provided, however, if either party fails to appoint a qualified appraiser within such fifteen (15) day period, then the conclusion of the qualified appraiser first appointed shall be final, conclusive and binding upon both parties. The qualified appraiser(s) appointed shall proceed to determine Fair Market Value and Fair Market Rate of Return, if applicable, within thirty (30) days following such appointment. The conclusion shall be final, conclusive and binding upon both the City and the Inn. If said appraisers should fail to agree, but the difference in their conclusions as to either the Fair Market Value or Fair Market Rate of Return is ten percent (10%) or less of the lower of the two corresponding appraisals, the Fair Market Value or Fair Market Rate of Return, as appropriate, shall be deemed the average of the two.

 If the two appraisers should fail to agree on the Fair Market Value or the Fair Market Rate of Return, and the difference between the two corresponding appraisals exceeds ten percent (10%), then the two appraisers thus appointed shall appoint a third qualified appraiser, and in case of their failure to agree on a third appraiser within fifteen (15) days after their individual determination of the Fair Market Value or Fair Market Rate of Return, either party may apply to the Presiding Judge of the King County Superior Court, requesting said Judge to appoint the third qualified appraiser. The third appraiser so appointed shall determine the Fair Market Value of the land or the Fair Market Rate of Return, as applicable, and the average of the appraisals of the two closest appraisers shall be final, conclusive and binding upon both parties. The fees and expenses of said third appraiser or the one appraiser the City and the Inn agree upon, shall be borne equally by the City and the Inn. The City and the Inn shall pay the fees and expenses of their respective appraisers if the parties fail to agree on a single appraiser. All appraisers appointed or selected pursuant to this Section shall have at least ten (10) years experience appraising properties in the Seattle, Washington, metropolitan area and shall be members of the American Institute of Real Estate Appraisers or its equivalent.

 Notwithstanding anything in this Section to the contrary, in no event shall the Annual Rent as recalculated as the result of any reappraisal be less than the amount of Annual Rent paid by the Inn for the year immediately prior to said reappraisal.

 6.6. Reduced Rent During Hotel Construction. From the date the Premises are closed for public parking as indicated in the notice referred to in Subsection 9.3, through completion of construction as defined in Subsection 10.11, below, the Inn shall pay an Interim Rent equal to fifty percent (50%) of the Annual Rent as adjusted each year in accordance with Paragraph 6.1.1.

The City shall deduct the balance of Interim Rent due, in advance at the City's discretion, from the Good Faith Deposit described in Section 8. In the event construction continues beyond seventeen (17) months, the City shall continue to deduct Interim Rent from the Good Faith Deposit at intervals determined by the City until the deposit is exhausted. Thereafter, the Inn shall directly pay the City the entire amount of Interim Rent due on a monthly basis. The Interim Rent shall be prorated to reflect the date the certificate of occupancy for the Hotel is issued.

All work required for the construction of the Hotel Improvements, including any site preparation work, landscaping work, utility installation work as well as actual construction work on the Hotel Improvements, shall be performed only by contractors duly licensed and bonded as such under the laws of the State of Washington and shall be performed pursuant to written contracts with such contractors. Each such contract shall provide for a retention fund of at least five percent (5%). The retention shall not be released to the contractor until or after the settlement and discharge of all liens of records, provided, however, the Inn may release those portions of the retention that are allocable to subcontracted work upon such subcontractors completing their subcontracted work and delivering lien releases for such work to the Inn. At no cost to the City, the Inn shall incorporate and require its contractor to comply with the Seattle Center Guidelines for Construction, attached hereto as Exhibit E, and with the insurance requirements contained in Exhibit G.

 10.10. Compliance with Law and Quality of Work. The Inn, at the Inn's sole cost and expense, shall cause all construction to be performed by or on behalf of the Inn under this Ground Lease to be approved by all appropriate governmental agencies and all applicable permits and authorizations shall be obtained by the Inn as and when required. The Hotel Improvements shall be constructed and all work performed shall be in accordance with all valid laws, ordinances, regulations, and orders of all federal, state, county, or local governmental agencies or entities having jurisdiction over the Premises; provided, however, that the Hotel Improvements shall be deemed to have been constructed in full compliance with all such valid laws, ordinances, regulations, and orders when a valid final certificate of occupancy entitling the Inn to occupy and use the Hotel Improvements has been duly issued by proper governmental agencies or entities. All work performed or authorized by this  Ground Lease, shall be done in a good workmanlike manner and only with new or recycled materials of good quality.

 10.11. Completion of Construction. The Inn shall apply for a master use permit within sixty (60) days following execution of this Ground Lease; shall cause construction of the Hotel Improvements to be commenced within sixty (60) days of receipt of said permit; shall cause construction of the Hotel Improvements to thereafter be diligently pursued without unnecessary interruption; and shall cause the Hotel to be completed and ready for occupancy not later than seventeen (17) months from commencement of construction. The Inn's failure to commence or complete construction of the Hotel Improvements within the times specified in this Section shall constitute a default by the Inn under this Ground Lease; provided, however, the Inn shall not be deemed in default by reason of any delay in commencement or completion of construction caused by any Force Majeure Event or other causes beyond the Inn's reasonable control. The Inn shall, however, use reasonable diligence to avoid any such delay and to resume and complete construction as promptly as possible after any delay. For the purposes of this Section, the term "commencement of construction" shall mean the date upon which the Inn commences preparatory site work, including grading, after necessary permits and approvals for such work have been obtained by the Inn from appropriate governmental agencies and the term "completion of construction" shall mean the date upon which a certificate of occupancy for the Hotel Improvements has been issued by the appropriate governmental authority and a copy of such certificate has been delivered to the City.

 10.12. Certificate and Survey. If requested by the Director, the Inn shall, within six months following completion of construction, procure and deliver to the Director the following:

 A. A certificate executed by the architect for the Hotel in favor of the City certifying that not only substantial completion, but also final completion of construction of the Hotel Improvements has occurred.

 B. A survey in a format acceptable to the City evidencing that the Hotel Improvements have been constructed within the property lines or confines of the Premises.

 10.13. Liens; Indemnification of the City. The Inn shall keep the Premises and the Hotel Improvements free and clear from any liens arising out of any work performed, materials furnished or obligations incurred by the Inn. If the Inn, in the Inn's discretion and in good faith, determines that any such lien should be contested, the Inn shall, at the Inn's sole cost and expense, procure and record a lien release bond, in an amount equal to one and one-half (1.5) times the amount of the claim of lien, issued by an insurance company acceptable to the City that is authorized to do business in the State of Washington. The bond shall provide for the payment of any sum that the claimant may recover on the claim (together with costs of suit, if any recovered in the action). The Inn's failure to procure and record such lien release bond within thirty (30) calendar days after demand by the City shall be deemed a default by the Inn under the terms of this Ground Lease. The Inn agrees to hold the City, the Premises and the Hotel Improvements free and harmless of all liability from any and all such liens, claims or demands, together with costs and expenses, including but not limited to reasonable attorney's fees, and other costs incurred by the City in connection therewith or arising out of the Inn's failure to comply with the requirements of this Section. The Inn shall pay to the City within five (5) calendar days after written demand, all such costs and expenses incurred by the City. In addition, the Inn shall indemnify and hold the City harmless from any and all claims for unpaid wages due to any laborer who has worked on the Hotel Improvements, whether such claim is made directly by any such laborer or any governmental entity on such laborer's behalf, together with any claims for interest and penalties associated with such unpaid wages. The indemnification provided herein shall survive the termination of this Ground Lease.

 10.14. Ownership of Plans and Specifications. All plans and specifications for the Hotel Improvements shall be the sole property of the Inn, subject to any rights of the architect.

 10.15. Ownership and Removal. For the duration of this Ground Lease, title to the Hotel Improvements as well as any and all additions to or alterations of the Hotel Improvements, shall remain in the Inn. Upon the expiration or sooner termination of this Ground Lease, the Hotel Improvements shall become at once a part of the realty and shall become the property of the City; provided, however, the City shall have the right by giving written notice to the Inn not later than two years before the expiration of this Ground Lease, or any renewal or extension thereof, or within ten calendar days after any termination of this Ground Lease (other than termination arising out of (i) natural expiration of the term of this Ground Lease, (ii) condemnation, or (iii) a default by the City hereunder), to require the Inn to demolish the Hotel Improvements. If the City so elects, the Inn shall remove said additions and alterations and use all reasonable efforts to restore the Premises to the condition existing immediately prior to the commencement of this Ground Lease before the last day of the term or, if later, within thirty (30) calendar days after the notice of such election is given to the Inn by the City. In the event the City elects to have the Hotel Improvements demolished only upon the expiration of the term of this Ground Lease, including any Extended Term(s), then the estimated cost of demolition shall be credited against the rental amounts due the City from the Inn for the last two years in which this Ground Lease is in effect, but in no event shall the credit exceed the actual demolition cost. Upon notification by the City of its election to have the Hotel Improvements demolished, the Annual Rent subject to the credit shall be deposited, when ordinarily due, in a separate account established by a national bank or other financial institution approved by the City and naming the City and the Inn as joint signatories. Funds in the account shall be invested in interest- bearing instruments approved by the Director in the exercise of such official's discretion. The interest earned on such deposited funds shall become the property of the City and both interest and principal shall be withdrawn or distributed only at the request of the Director. Upon determination of the actual cost of demolition if the actual cost of demolition varies from the estimated cost of demolition, the Inn shall be reimbursed for the difference by the City.

 10.16. Zoning. The Director agrees, from time to time upon request of the Inn, to execute such documents, petitions, applications and authorizations as may be required by governmental authorities in order to permit construction of the Hotel Improvements; provided, however, that such documents, petitions, applications and authorizations must be either consistent with the plans and specifications previously approved by the Director or otherwise acceptable to the City in its reasonable discretion.

 10.17. Covenants, Conditions and Restrictions. At the request of the Inn, the Director shall, from time to time, under terms and conditions acceptable to the City in its reasonable discretion, execute and deliver or join in the execution and delivery of such documents as are appropriate, necessary or required to permit the orderly development of the Premises.

 10.18. Cost and Expense. In each of the instances described in Subsections 10.16 and 10.17, above, the City shall be without expense therefor, the cost and expense thereof to be borne solely by the Inn.

 10.19. Bus Parking. The Inn shall be responsible for obtaining all necessary permits to allow temporary bus parking at the Premises.

 11. PROJECT MANAGEMENT AND COORDINATION.

 11.1. Designation of Project Manager. Within five business days after the date this Ground Lease has been fully executed, the Inn shall notify the Director, in writing, of the name and business and home telephone numbers of the individual who shall serve as the Inn project manager for the purpose of liaison between the City and the Inn regarding any and all matters related to the construction of the Hotel Improvements, and the City shall so notify the Inn of the identity of the Seattle Center project manager. In the event either such person is replaced, then not later than the effective date of such replacement the party making such change in personnel shall notify the other of the change, indicating the effective date of the replacement, and the name and business and home telephone numbers of the replacement.

 11.2. Coordination Meetings. The Inn's project manager shall schedule and hold, not less than bi-weekly, project construction meetings with the Seattle Center project manager, and shall keep the Seattle Center project manager informed of the time and place of each regularly scheduled meeting between the Inn project manager and the Inn's contractor to enable the Seattle Center project manager to attend, become informed about the status of the construction, participate in discussions and present the Seattle Center's position with respect to matters being discussed. The Inn project manager shall also participate in such separate meetings with the Seattle Center project manager and, at the Director's option, with the Director's designee, as are scheduled by the Seattle Center project manager with at least three (3) day's prior notice.

 11.3. Status Reports. Within seven days after the receipt by the Inn of the Hotel construction progress meeting minutes, change orders, and the Hotel contractor's monthly schedules, a copy of each of the same shall be sent to the Seattle Center project manager.

 11.4. Removal, Damage or Destruction of Trees. No trees located off the Premises shall be moved or destroyed without the written approval of the Seattle Center project manager. At the Seattle Center's discretion, the Inn shall replace or compensate the City for any tree destroyed in an amount to be determined by a certified arborist designated by the Director, but in no event shall the payment be less than $500.00 per tree. Existing street trees on the eastern edge of the Premises shall be retained and protected during construction wherever possible. In the event construction necessitates the removal of any of these trees, they shall be replaced with the same or with new trees of the same species and size, and approved by the Director or her designee.

 11.5. Seattle Center Project Manager's Review of Design Plans and Specifications, Changes Thereto, and Construction. The Inn project manager shall ensure that the Seattle Center project manager is provided the opportunity to become actively involved and to serve as an equal participant in on-going decision-making with respect to the exterior finishes, landscaping and design of the garage levels of the Premises, whether such decision-making occurs during the design phase or the construction phase of the project. The Inn project manager shall ensure that in the periodic construction meetings and otherwise, as necessary, from the date this Ground Lease is fully executed until final completion of the Hotel Improvements, the Seattle Center project manager is provided a reasonable opportunity to review and comment on such features of the Hotel Improvements, and on the status of construction progress. Any question regarding whether or not an exterior finish, landscape, or garage-related matter requires review and participation by the Seattle Center project manager shall be resolved in favor of its being significant and warranting the involvement of the Seattle Center project manager in decision- making with respect thereto. The Inn project manager shall also ensure that a copy of each request for information, change request and construction change directive relating to said exterior finishes, landscaping and garage is made available to the Seattle Center project manager for inspection and copying, at no charge to the City.

 11.5.1. The Seattle Center project manager shall review and provide comment, as contemplated in Subsection 11.5, in an expeditious and reasonable manner so as to not unreasonably delay the work; provided, that in the event the Seattle Center project manager's review of, and comment on, any particular design, plan, or specification element or any proposed change thereto is required on or by a particular date and time, the Inn project manager shall provide reasonable advance notice to the Seattle Center project manager of such need and identify the specific date by when such review and comment must be completed and provided. If, in the exercise of his or her reasonable discretion under the circumstances, the Inn project manager determines that the Seattle Center project manager's response is required so quickly that there is insufficient time to allow for written notice of the need for such official's review and comment by the critical date, such notice may be given orally, but shall then be immediately confirmed in writing by the Inn project manager.

 11.5.2. In the event that the Seattle Center project manager does not respond to a request for comment from the Inn project manager on or by the specified date therefor, and provided reasonable advance notice has been provided to the Seattle Center project manager as contemplated herein, then the Seattle Center project manager shall be deemed to have waived the opportunity to review and comment on the particular matter(s) made available for review and comment, and the Inn may proceed as if the Seattle Center project manager had reviewed and commented consistent with the Inn project manager's decision with respect to the reviewable matter(s).

Prior to commencing any construction on the Premises, the Inn shall develop and submit to the Seattle Center project manager for approval a traffic control plan addressing the following issues, among others: pedestrian safety, traffic routing, pedestrian routing, and mobilization of truck traffic to and from the Premises. The traffic control plan shall be implemented and remain in effect throughout the period of construction, at the Inn's sole cost and expense, and shall not be altered without the Seattle Center project manager's approval, which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned. To the extent the traffic control plan conflicts with the Guidelines for Construction set forth in Exhibit E hereto, the traffic control plan shall govern

 12.6. Director's Right to Suspend Project for Cause. If the Inn fails or refuses to perform any of its obligations in accordance with this Ground Lease and such failure or refusal constitutes a material breach and default, the Director may issue a notice ordering the Inn to stop construction work on the Premises, or any portion thereof, until satisfactory corrective action has been taken; provided, however, that except in cases of emergency, the Director will provide the Inn with at least ten (10) days' advance written notice that it intends to issue such a suspension notice unless the breach and default involves a perceived threat to life or safety, in which case only three (3) days' advance written notice shall be required. The Inn shall not be entitled to damages from the City as a consequence of any increased cost or time of performance attributable to the Inn's failure or refusal to perform or from any reasonable remedial action taken by the City based upon such failure or refusal to perform. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Inn may seek damages from the City if it is determined in accordance with the procedures outlined in Section 36 that the Director issued such notice without a reasonable basis.

 12.7. Record Drawings and Operations and Maintenance Manuals.

The Inn shall not be entitled to an offset, reduction, or return of rental as a result of any interruption or failure of said services.

 13.3. The Inn's Right to Contest. The Inn shall have the right to contest or review by legal proceedings or in such other manner as may be legal, any tax, assessment, utility charge or other governmental imposition and to pay such items under protest; provided, that nothing in this Section shall be construed to restrain the exercise of any remedy by any City utility for nonpayment, and provided further that notwithstanding any protest or challenge the Inn shall timely pay such amounts as are necessary to avoid interruption in service, including any interruption that would occur from application of the normal policy or procedure of any City utility.

 14. INSURANCE.

 14.1. Compliance with Insurance Requirements. No use shall be made by the Inn or permitted by the Inn to be made on, to or of the Premises, nor acts done, which will cause the cancellation of any insurance policy covering the Premises or the Hotel Improvements, nor shall the Inn sell or permit to be kept, used or sold in and about the Premises or the Hotel Improvements any article which may be prohibited by the standard form of fire insurance policy. The Inn shall, at the Inn's sole cost and expense, comply with any and all requirements pertaining to the Premises and the Hotel Improvements, of any insurance organization or company, necessary for the maintenance of reasonable fire and public liability insurance covering the Premises and the Hotel Improvements.

Throughout the term of this Ground Lease and any renewal or extension thereof, the Inn, its sublessees and contractors, shall procure and maintain at all times in full force and effect, at no cost to the City, the insurance specified in Exhibit G hereto, (or its then-available equivalent); provided, however, that the Inn shall have the right at any time it believes the insurance required by Exhibit G is no longer consistent with industry standards for comparable tenants, to request that the City consent to an alteration in the insurance coverages or amounts required hereunder, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld.

 14.3. Disposition of Insurance Proceeds. If the Hotel Improvements are partially or totally destroyed from a risk covered by insurance required by this Section, the Inn shall make the loss adjustment with the insurance company insuring the loss. The insurance proceeds allocable to the Hotel Improvements (but specifically excluding the insurance proceeds allocable to the personal property, moveable furniture and trade fixtures in and to which the City shall have no rights or interest), shall be paid directly to an institutional lender or title company, hereinafter referred to as the "Insurance Trustee," mutually selected by the City and the Inn. If the Hotel Improvements shall be partially or totally destroyed from a risk not covered by insurance required by this Section, the Inn shall immediately deposit with the Insurance Trustee the cost of repair and restoration. All sums deposited with the Insurance Trustee in accordance with the foregoing shall be held, administered and disbursed in accordance with Section 19 below. In connection with the foregoing, the Insurance Trustee shall have the following powers and duties:

 B. Payments shall be made on presentation of certificates or vouchers from the architect or engineer retained by the Inn showing the amount due. If the Insurance Trustee, in its reasonable discretion, determines that the certificates or vouchers are being improperly approved by the architect or engineer retained by the Inn, the Insurance Trustee shall have the right to appoint an architect or an engineer to supervise construction and to make payments on certificates or vouchers approved by the architect or engineer retained by the Insurance Trustee. The Insurance Trustee shall pay the reasonable expenses and charges of the architect or engineer retained by the Insurance Trustee out of the Trust Fund.

 C. Any sums not disbursed by the Insurance Trustee after construction has been completed and final payment has been made to the Inn's contractor shall be paid to the Inn.

 The Inn and the City shall share all actual costs and charges of the Insurance Trustee equally. If the Insurance Trustee resigns or for any reason is unwilling to act or continue to act, the City and the Inn shall agree upon a substitute institutional lender or title company as a new Insurance Trustee. The City and the Inn shall each execute all documents and perform all acts reasonably required by the Insurance Trustee to perform its obligations under this Section.

 19.3. Major Damage or Destruction.

All repair and reconstruction work under this Subsection 19.4 shall be conducted substantially in the same manner and in accordance with the requirements and procedures set forth in Sections 10, 11 and 12 of this Ground Lease.

 20. CONDEMNATION.

 20.1. Definitions.

 A. "Eminent domain" is the right of the people or government to take private property for public use. As used in this Section 20 the words "condemned" and "condemnation" are coextensive with such right, and a voluntary conveyance by the City to the condemnor under threat of a taking under the power of eminent domain in lieu or after commencement of formal proceedings shall be deemed a taking within the meaning of this Section 20.

 B. "Total condemnation" and "total taking" mean the taking of the entire Premises under the power of eminent domain or a taking of so much of the Premises under such power as to prevent or substantially impair the conduct of the Inn's business thereon.

 C. "Partial condemnation" and "partial taking" mean any condemnation of the Premises other than a total taking as defined above.

 20.2. Effect of Total Condemnation. In the event that there shall be a total taking of the Premises during the term of this Ground Lease, or any renewal or extension thereof, under the power of eminent domain as defined in this Section, the leasehold estate hereby created in the Premises shall cease and terminate as of the date title to the Premises is taken by the condemnor. On termination of this Ground Lease by a total taking of the Premises under the power of eminent domain, all rentals and other charges payable by either party to or on behalf of the other under the provisions of this Ground Lease shall be paid (or refunded to the extent rent has been prepaid) up to the date on which actual physical possession of the Premises shall be taken by the condemnor, and the parties hereto shall thereafter be released from all further liability in relation thereto.

 20.3. Effect of Partial Condemnation. In the event that there shall be a partial taking of the Premises during the term of this Ground Lease, or any renewal or extension thereof, under the power of eminent domain as defined in this Section, this Ground Lease shall terminate as to the portion of the Premises so taken on the date title is taken by the condemnor or at the time the condemnor is authorized to take possession of said real property as stated in the order for possession, whichever is earlier. This Ground Lease shall also terminate on such date as to the balance of the Premises once more than ten percent (10%) of the ground area (including the common area) or five percent (5%) of the floor area of the Hotel Improvements have been taken and the Inn gives written notice of termination to the City within thirty (30) calendar days after the City shall have given the Inn written notice of said taking, or in the absence of said notice, within ten (10) calendar days after the condemnor is authorized to take possession as stated in the order for possession. If less than such percentage of ground area or floor area is taken or the Inn fails to timely elect to terminate, this Ground Lease shall continue in full force and effect as to the remainder of the Premises not so taken.

 20.4. Award. Any compensation or damages awarded or payable because of the taking of all or any portion of the Premises by eminent domain shall be allocated between the City and the Inn as follows:

 A. All compensation or damages awarded or payable for the taking by eminent domain of any land that is part of the Premises shall be paid to and be the sole property of the City free and clear of any claim of the Inn or any person claiming rights to the Premises through or under the Inn.

 B. All compensation or damages awarded or payable because of the Hotel Improvements, where only a portion of the Premises is taken by eminent domain and the Inn is not entitled to or does not terminate this Ground Lease shall be applied toward the replacement of the Hotel Improvements with their equivalent on the remaining portions of the Premises.

 C. All compensation or damages awarded or payable because of the Hotel Improvements, where this Ground Lease is terminated because of the taking by eminent domain, whether all or only a portion of the Premises is taken by eminent domain, shall be allocated between the City and the Inn as follows:

 (1) That percentage of the compensation or damages awarded or payable because of the Hotel Improvements, excluding the City Parking Facility, that equals the percentage of the initial term of this Ground Lease that has at the time of the taking, not expired shall belong to and be the sole property of the Inn.

 (2) That percentage of the compensation or damages awarded or payable because of the Hotel Improvements, excluding the City Parking Facility, that equals the percentage of the full term of this Ground Lease has, at the time of the taking, expired shall belong to an be the sole property of the City.

 (3) That percentage of the compensation or damages awarded or payable because of the City Parking Facility shall belong to and be the sole property of the City.

 (4) The term "time of taking" as used in this subsection shall mean 12:01 a.m. of whichever shall occur first, the date title or the date physical possession of the Premises or any portion thereof is taken by the agency or entity exercising the eminent domain power.

 D. Any severance damages awarded or payable because only a portion of the Premises is taken by eminent domain shall be the sole and separate property of the City.

 21. BANKRUPTCY OR INSOLVENCY.

 In the event the Inn voluntarily or involuntarily files for an order for relief under the bankruptcy code, or similar provisions of succeeding law or makes an assignment for the benefit of creditors, or if a receiver is appointed over all or any portion of the Inn's assets located upon the Premises, and such receivership continues for a period of 120 calendar days, or if an attachment or execution or process of court issuing upon or against all or any portion of the Inn's property located upon the Premises remains unreleased for a period of 120 calendar days, such event shall constitute, at the option of the City, an event of Default (as defined in Section 22 below) and the City shall thereafter have all of the remedies for such Default set forth in Section 22 below (including the right to terminate this Ground Lease).

 22. INN DEFAULT AND CITY REMEDIES.

 22.1. Definition. If the Inn materially violates or breaches or fails to keep or perform any covenant, term or condition of this Ground Lease, the Inn shall be deemed in default hereunder (a "Default"). If a Default continues for or is not remedied within ten (10) days or such longer period as may be reasonably required to cure the default, provided the Inn commences the cure within said ten (10) days after the City's written notice of default and covenants to diligently complete the cure within such reasonable period, then the City shall have the following rights and remedies, at its option which are not exclusive: (i) to declare the term hereof ended and to reenter the Premises and take possession thereof, including the Hotel Improvements, and remove all persons therefrom, and the Inn shall have no further claim thereon or hereunder; (ii) to cure such default on the Inn's behalf and at the Inn's sole expense and charge the Inn for all costs and expenses incurred by the City in effecting such cure as Additional Rent; (iii) without declaring this Lease terminated, to reenter the Premises, including the Hotel Improvements and occupy the whole or any part thereof for and on account of the Inn and to collect any unpaid Annual Rent which has become payable, or which may thereafter become payable; or (iv) even though it may have reentered the Premises, at any time thereafter elect to terminate this Lease and all of the rights of the Inn in or to the Premises and the Hotel Improvements.

 22.2. Reentry. If the City reenters the Premises under option (iii) of Subsection 22.1, the City shall not be deemed to have terminated this Lease or the liability of the Inn to pay any Annual Rent thereafter accruing as it becomes due, or to have terminated the Inn's liability for damages under any of the provisions hereof, by any such reentry or by any action, in unlawful detainer or otherwise, to obtain possession of the Premises, unless the City shall have notified the Inn in writing that it has so elected to terminate this Lease, and the Inn shall be liable for and reimburse the City upon demand for all costs and expenses of every kind and nature incurred in retaking possession of the Premises and all other losses suffered by the City as a consequence of the Inn's default. In the event of any entry or taking possession of the Premises, the City shall have the right, but not the obligation, to remove therefrom all or any part of the personal property located therein and may place the same in storage at a public warehouse at the expense and risk of the Inn.

 22.3. Termination. If the City elects to terminate this Lease pursuant to the provisions of options (i) or (iv) of Subsection 22.1, the City may recover from the Inn as damages, the following: (i) the worth at the time of award of any unpaid Annual Rent which had been earned at the time of such termination; plus (ii) the worth at the time of award of the amount by which the unpaid Annual Rent which would have been earned after termination until the time of award exceeds the amount of the Annual Rent loss the Inn proves could have been reasonably avoided; plus (iii) the worth at the time of award of the amount by which the unpaid Annual Rent for the balance of the term after the time of award exceeds the amount of the Annual Rent loss that the Inn proves could be reasonably avoided; plus (iv) any other amount necessary to compensate the City for all the detriment proximately caused by the Inn's failure to perform its obligations under this Ground Lease or which in the ordinary course of things would be likely to result therefrom, including but not limited to, any costs or expenses incurred by the City in retaking possession of the Premises, including reasonable attorneys fees therefor; maintaining or preserving the Premises after such default; preparing the Premises for reletting to a new tenant, including repairs or alterations to the Premises for such reletting; leasing commissions; and any other costs necessary or appropriate to relet the Premises; and (v) such other amounts in addition to or in lieu of the foregoing as may be permitted from time to time by the laws of the State of Washington. As used in items (i) and (ii) of this Subsection 22.3, the "worth at the time of award" shall be computed by allowing interest at the interest rate specified in Section 7 of this Ground Lease. As used in item (iii) above, the "worth at the time of award" shall be computed by using the then applicable discount rate quoted by the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco or its successor. For purposes of this Section 22 only, the term "Annual Rent" shall be deemed to be the Annual Rent and all Additional Rent and other sums required to be paid by the Inn pursuant to the terms of this Ground Lease.

 22.4. Vacation or Abandonment. If the Inn vacates or abandons the Premises and fails to reoccupy them within ten (10) days after the City (1) delivers a notice to the Premises (which will be unoccupied) demanding such reoccupancy and (2) mails by certified or registered mail a copy of the notice to any forwarding address given by the Inn to the City in writing, the Inn shall be in default under this Ground Lease and, in addition to all of the City's rights and remedies provided for above, in the event of such a default by the Inn, the City shall have the right to increase the Annual Rent during the entire time that the Premises are abandoned or have been vacated to one hundred twenty-five percent (125%) of the Annual Rent otherwise in effect during such period under Section 6. Moreover, the Inn agrees that such right on the part of the City to increase the Annual Rent shall not be deemed to be a penalty; rather, the 125% figure has been agreed to by the City and the Inn as a fair approximation of the damages the City will suffer as a result of a vacation or abandonment by the Inn, which damages would otherwise be extremely difficult to ascertain.

 22.5. The City's Remedies Cumulative; Waiver. The City's rights and remedies hereunder are not exclusive, but cumulative, and the City's exercise of any right or remedy due to a default or breach by the Inn shall not be deemed a waiver of, or alter, affect or prejudice any other right or remedy which the City may have under this Ground Lease or by law or in equity. Neither the acceptance of rent nor any other acts or omissions of the City at any time or times after the happening of any event authorizing the cancellation or forfeiture of this Ground Lease shall operate as a waiver of any past or future violation, breach or failure to keep or perform any covenant, agreement, term or condition hereof or to deprive the City of its right to cancel or forfeit this Lease, upon the written notice provided for herein, at any time that cause for cancellation or forfeiture may exist, or be construed so as at any future time to estop the City from promptly exercising any other option, right or remedy that it may have under any term or provision of this Lease.

 23. SUBLEASES AND ASSIGNMENTS.

 The Inn shall not voluntarily, involuntarily or by operation of law, assign, license, mortgage, hypothecate, sublet or in any manner transfer this Ground Lease, any interest herein, any option that may be contained herein to all or any portion of the Premises or any title or interest in all or a portion of the Inn's interest in the Hotel Improvements, nor shall the Inn authorize, allow or permit any person (the employees of the Inn excepted), to occupy or use the Premises or any portion thereof or the Hotel Improvements, without first obtaining the written consent and approval of the Director which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld. Any transfer of this Ground Lease by merger, consolidation or liquidation, or any direct or indirect change, in the membership of the Inn, shall constitute an assignment for the purposes of this Ground Lease. Any assignment, license, mortgage, sublease, hypothecation, transfer, occupancy or use of the Premises or the Hotel Improvements in violation of this paragraph shall be null and void and of no force and effect and shall further constitute a breach of this Ground Lease by the Inn. The giving by the Director of such consent and approval shall not be deemed to be a consent or approval to any subsequent assignment, license, mortgage, sublease, hypothecation, transfer, occupancy or use by any other person nor shall it release the Inn of any of the Inn's obligations to pay the Annual Rent and perform all other continuing obligations to be performed by the Inn hereunder. Any dissolution, merger, consolidation or other reorganization of the Inn shall constitute and be deemed an assignment for purposes of this Section.

 24. SURRENDER.

 Unless requested to demolish the Hotel Improvements and restore the Premises in accordance with Subsection 10.15, above, the Inn agrees that on the last day of the term or the sooner termination of this Ground Lease, the Inn will surrender the Premises and the Hotel Improvements to the City in good condition, reasonable use and wear and tear of the Hotel Improvements excepted. Upon termination of this Ground Lease, the Inn shall have no further interest in the Hotel Improvements or the Premises. If so requested by the City, the Inn shall convey to the City by special warranty deed and/or by bill of sale, all Hotel Improvements, subject only to such encumbrances and leases as shall have been specifically approved in writing by the Director. On or before such termination date the Inn shall deliver to the Director (a) all keys to any structures, fixtures or personal property on the Premises; and (b) all plans, blueprints, surveys, diagrams, leases, contracts and documents relating to the Premises or the Hotel Improvements. Upon the termination or expiration of this Ground Lease, the Inn shall have the right and shall be given a reasonable opportunity not to exceed 90 days, provided the Inn is not then in default, to remove from the Premises any furnishings, equipment and other personal property not constituting Hotel Improvements as defined in Section 2. The Inn shall, at the Inn's sole cost and expense, immediately repair all damage done or occasioned by reason of the removal of any such furnishings, equipment and personal property. All property not removed by the Inn within 90 days of termination shall be deemed to have been abandoned by the Inn and may be appropriated, sold, stored, destroyed or otherwise disposed of by the City without notice to the Inn and without obligation to account therefor. If the Ground Lease shall be terminated as to a portion of the Premises then this Section shall apply to such portion and all improvements thereon, together with all related personal property.

 25. HOLDING OVER.

 If the Inn shall, with the acknowledgment and consent of the City, continue to remain in possession of the Premises after the expiration of the term of this Ground Lease or any extension or renewal hereof, such holding over shall be on a month-to-month basis and shall not constitute a re-letting or releasing of the Premises. Said tenancy from month-to-month shall be upon the same terms and conditions herein specified and shall continue to be such until 30 calendar days after the Inn shall have given to the City or the City shall have given to the Inn a written notice of termination of such monthly tenancy. Nothing contained herein shall be construed as a consent by the City to the occupancy or possession of the Premises by the Inn after the expiration of the term hereof.

Nothing in this Ground Lease, including the City's receipt, review or approval of any request for authorization, data, record, report, or plan shall relieve the Inn of any legal obligation, including but not limited to the obligation to provide a safe and healthful working environment or to comply with all Environmental and Safety Laws.

 31.6. Completion of Remedial Work; Accounting. Once the Inn or the City has completed any Remedial Work, the Inn or the City shall provide to the other party invoices and accounting of costs for the completed Remedial Work, including the Remedial Work Agreement and any subsequent Remedial Work Notice and documentation establishing the nature, extent and cost of the work (the "Remedial Work Accounting"). Each party shall endeavor to submit only one Remedial Work Accounting. The Inn's recoverable costs for Remedial Work are limited to incremental costs incurred after the date of execution of the Ground Lease and over and above the ordinary and usual costs to the Inn for construction of the Hotel Improvements, to the extent such incremental costs are caused by the presence or suspected presence of Existing Hazardous Substances. Recoverable costs do not include costs, losses, or claims of any kind associated with delay or incidental or consequential damages to any entity. The party receiving the Remedial Work Accounting shall have thirty (30) days to review the Remedial Work Accounting. If such party disagrees with the accounting, such party shall provide written notice of its disagreement within thirty (30) days. If the party receiving notice of the accounting does not provide written notice of disagreement within thirty (30) days of actual receipt of a Remedial Work Accounting, the costs of the Remedial Work Accounting shall be deemed approved.

 31.7. Dispute Resolution. At the request of the City or the Inn, the parties shall meet to discuss any disagreements and shall in good faith attempt to reach resolution without delay. If construction or renovation activity has been delayed because of the presence of Existing Hazardous Substances, and the Inn and the City are unable to reach agreement between subordinate staff within five (5) days regarding an appropriate Remedial Work Agreement, the appropriateness or conduct of remediation work, or termination pursuant to Subsection 31.9, then the matter shall immediately be referred to the Director and the Inn Managing Director, the remaining dispute resolution procedures set forth in Section 36 of this Ground Lease shall be used, and both parties shall use best efforts to expedite resolution. If the Inn and the City are not able to reach agreement on cost of Remedial Work or Remedial Work Accounting, then the City and the Inn shall use the dispute resolution procedures set forth in Section 36 of this Ground Lease. The parties shall attempt to resolve all Remedial Work Accounting disagreements through one dispute resolution process.

 31.8. Remedial Work Costs; Rent Credit. The "Approved Costs Total" is the total of costs of any approved Remedial Work Accountings and of any Remedial Work amounts agreed by the City and the Inn to be recoverable costs or upon which final judgment is entered. The Inn shall be solely responsible for payment of the first $100,000 of the Approved costs Total. That portion of the Approved Costs Total exceeding $100,000 that the parties have agreed shall be the responsibility of the City (the "Approved City Costs Sum") shall be treated as rental payment credits as follows unless some other payment plan is agreed upon by the parties:

 Twenty percent (20%) of the Approved the Inn Costs Sum shall be credited against each of the first five (5) payments of annual rent due under this Ground Lease after the total for the recoverable cost of such Remedial Work is finally determined.

 31.9. Right of Termination. If in the opinion of the Inn, the recoverable costs of Remedial Work are reasonably anticipated to exceed $100,000, as substantiated and documented by the written opinion of a qualified environmental professional and detailed cost estimates approved by such professional ("Documentation") and the parties are unable to agree on a cost-sharing formula, then either party may notify the other in writing of its intention to terminate this Ground Lease at the end of thirty (30) days, providing the Documentation to the City with the notice. The party giving notice shall arrange a meeting of the parties within ten (10) days after providing actual notice, and the parties shall meet and in good faith discuss options for resolution that would allow the construction of Hotel Improvements to proceed. If prior to the expiration of the thirty (30) day period, the Director gives written notice to the Inn that the City agrees to accept a lesser degree of remediation in fulfillment of the Inn's remediation obligations stated in this Section 31 or if the Inn and the City reach another agreement to continue the Ground Lease, then the Ground Lease shall not terminate pursuant to this Section. In the event of termination, the Inn shall thereafter have no further obligation to construct the Hotel Improvements, and the Inn shall bear the costs it has expended through the date of termination relating to the Ground Lease and the development of the Hotel to the date of termination. Upon termination, at the City's request and at its option, and provided the Inn is permitted to do so by the agencies with jurisdiction over the discovered Hazardous Substances, the Inn shall restore the Premises to its condition immediately prior to the date of this Ground Lease or such other condition as may be agreed upon by the parties, or pay the City directly the estimated cost of such restoration, exclusive of any remediation costs, which shall be the responsibility of the City.

 31.10. Compliance and Correction of Violations. With respect to the Premises and the Hotel Improvements, the Inn shall comply, and shall guarantee compliance by all of its employees, agents and contractors, with all Environmental or Safety Laws at all times during the term of this Ground Lease. If the Inn or any of the Inn's employees, agents or contractors violates any applicable Environmental or Safety Law or any of the terms of this Ground Lease concerning the presence or use of Hazardous Substances or the handling or storing of Hazardous Substances, upon receipt of notice of such violation or the expiration of all challenges and appeals of such notice, whichever occurs later, the Inn shall promptly take such action as is necessary to mitigate and correct the violation. If the Inn does not act in a prudent and prompt manner, the City reserves the right, but not the obligation, upon reasonable prior notice to the Inn, to act in place of the Inn (for which purpose, only, the Inn hereby appoints City as its agent), to come onto the Premises or the Hotel Improvements and to take such action as is necessary to ensure compliance or to mitigate the violation, all at the Inn's sole cost and expense. If the Director has reason to believe that the Inn or the Inn's agent or contractor is in violation of any Environmental or Safety Law, or that the Inn's actions or omissions present a threat of violation or a threat of damage to the Premises or the Hotel Improvements, the City reserves the right, upon reasonable prior notice to the Inn, to enter onto the Premises or the Hotel Improvements and take such corrective or mitigating action as the Director deems necessary. All reasonable costs and expenses incurred by the City directly attributable to any such action shall become immediately due and payable by the Inn upon presentation of an invoice therefor.

 31.11. Testing. The Inn shall provide City with access to the Premises and the Hotel Improvements to conduct an environmental inspection at such reasonable time(s) as may be requested by City. In addition, the Inn shall permit City access to the Premises and the Hotel Improvements at any time, upon reasonable notice, for the purpose of conducting environmental testing at the City's expense. The Inn shall promptly inform the Director of the existence of any environmental study, evaluation, investigation or results of any environmental testing conducted on the Premises or the Hotel Improvements whenever the same becomes known to the Inn, and the Inn shall provide a written copy of the same to the Director as soon as reasonably possible and not later than thirty (30) days after the preparation of any such material.

 31.12. Removal of Hazardous Substances. In addition to all other requirements under this Ground Lease, the Inn or the Inn's contractor shall promptly remove any and all Hazardous Substances released on the Premises or in the Hotel Improvements by the Inn or any of its employees, agents or contractors during the term of this Ground Lease. Upon the expiration or termination of this Ground Lease, the Inn shall remove from the Premises and Hotel Improvements all Hazardous Substances stored on site as a result of any activities by or for the Inn or any activities associated with the operation of the Hotel. The Inn shall demonstrate such removal and any necessary remediation to the Director's reasonable satisfaction, which may include, but is not limited to, attaining MTCA cleanup levels and applying for and obtaining from the Washington Department of Ecology ("DOE") a final No Further Action ("NFA") letter pursuant to the Independent Remedial Action Program. The NFA letter shall not be considered "final" for the purposes of the Ground Lease if the letter describes institutional controls or other conditions, unless the City has agreed to such institutional controls or conditions in lieu of further Remedial Work. The Inn shall make available for inspection at the Inn's place of business, upon reasonable request by the City, all records pertaining to remediation and disposal, and shall not destroy any such records without prior City approval.

 31.13. Reimbursement of City Costs. In addition to any remedy provided above, the City shall be entitled to full reimbursement from the Inn whenever the City incurs any cost directly resulting from a violation by the Inn or the Inn's employees, agents or contractors of any Environmental or Safety Law or of the terms of this Section, including, but not limited to, the costs of any investigation, clean-up and other remedial activity; the fees of consultants, contractors, and attorneys; fines and penalties assessed directly against the City; injuries to third persons or other property; and losses of revenue resulting from an inability to lease or re-license or market the Premises or the Hotel Improvements due to its environmental condition as the result of the Inn's violation of the terms of this Ground Lease (even if such loss of revenue occurs after the expiration or earlier termination of this Ground Lease).

 31.14. Release and Indemnification. In addition to all other indemnification provided in this Ground Lease, and notwithstanding the expiration or earlier termination of this Ground Lease, the Inn shall release, defend, indemnify and hold the City free and harmless from any and all claims, causes of action, regulatory demands, liabilities, fines, penalties, losses, damages, consequential damages and expenses, including without limitation environmental cleanup or other remedial costs (and including the fees of consultants, contractors and attorneys, costs and all other reasonable litigation expenses when incurred and whether incurred in defense of actual litigation or in reasonable anticipation of litigation), whether made, commenced or incurred during the term of this Ground Lease or after the expiration or termination of this Ground Lease if arising out of any of the following: (i) the presence on, in or under the Premises or Hotel Improvements during the term of the Ground Lease (unless as the result of in-migration of a Hazardous Substance for which the Inn is not responsible), or the migration from the Premises or Hotel Improvements to other property or into the surrounding environment, of any Hazardous Substance other than an Existing Hazardous Substance or a Hazardous Substance brought onto the Premises or the Hotel Improvements by the City or by any of its employees, agents or contractors, (ii) the Inn's breach of any provision of the Environmental Protection portion of this Ground Lease (Section 31), (iii) the acts or omissions of the Inn or any of the Inn's employees, agents or contractors in remedying any environmental contamination discovered in preparation for or during any construction or renovation undertaken by or for the Inn, or (iv) any claims against the City by the Inn or any of its employees, agents, contractors or subcontractors based upon delay in construction or other activity resulting from Remedial Work or other environmental remediation activities conducted during the term of the Ground Lease. The Inn further agrees to release the City from any and all claims, causes of action, liabilities and damages arising from the City's exercise of its right (or from the City's choice not to exercise its right) to undertake investigation or remediation of contamination existing off the Premises, except to the extent caused by the City's negligence.

 32. SECURITY.

 The Inn, at its sole expense, shall provide or cause to be provided all security services on the Premises and for the Hotel as are customary and appropriate for a facility of this type. The City shall provide exterior security to the same extent as provided to other Seattle Center tenants.

 33. RIGHTS RESERVED BY CITY.

 The City reserves for itself, its officers, employees, agents and contractors, free access to those areas of the Premises, including the Hotel Improvements, containing any control or other equipment necessary to the operation of any systems affecting the operation of the City Parking Facility. The City shall also be permitted access to the Hotel Improvements, at all reasonable times and without any rebate of rent to the Inn for any loss of occupation or quiet enjoyment of the Premises occasioned thereby, for the purpose of inspecting, cleaning, or making repairs, additions or alterations to the Premises or any other property owned by or under the control of the City, but this right shall not be construed as an agreement on the part of the City to make inspections, clean or make repairs, additions or alterations. In addition, the City expressly reserves the right, without liability of any kind, to do the following:

 A. increase, reduce, or change in any manner whatsoever the number, appearance, dimensions, and locations of City streets, walks, buildings, and parking and service areas except the Premises; and may make improvements, alterations or additions to buildings and add buildings adjoining the Premises or elsewhere in the Seattle Center;

 B. regulate all traffic within the Seattle Center;

 C. impose a reasonable charge for admission to the Seattle Center and the facilities thereon;

 D. erect, display and remove promotional exhibits and material and permit special events on the Seattle Center grounds, buildings, and facilities, including the City Parking Facility;

 E. promulgate, from time to time, reasonable rules and regulations regarding the use and occupancy of all areas of the Seattle Center, including the City Parking Facility;

 F. determine the days and hours the Seattle Center and various business operations, including the City Parking Facility will be open to the public, with the exception of the Hotel;

 G. determine the size, number, type and identity of other concessions, stores, businesses and operations being conducted or undertaken at Seattle Center, and to operate and to authorize others to engage in any and all forms and locations of business activity at the Seattle Center;

 all without affecting the obligations of the parties hereunder. The City shall not be liable to the Inn for any interference with light, air, view, or for interference caused by operations by or for the City in the maintenance or construction of any public work provided that the City utilizes all reasonable efforts to minimize any interference occasioned thereby.

 The rights reserved hereunder may be transferred by the City wholly or in part to any private or public parties, whether or not in connection with the transfer of a fee interest in the Premises or any part thereof, and shall be exercised in such manner as does not unreasonably interfere with the Inn's access to and use of the Hotel on the Premises or conflict with the other provisions of this Ground Lease.

 34. RECOGNITION OF HOTEL LOCATION AT SEATTLE CENTER.

 At Seattle Center's request, the Inn shall include in any promotional material imprinted, published or otherwise produced by or on behalf of the Inn that makes reference to the Hotel, notice that the Hotel is located at the Seattle Center; provided, however, that the words "Seattle Center" shall not be used in the Hotel name without the prior written consent of the Director.

 35. CITY'S CONSENT OR APPROVAL.

 Whenever the consent of the City or the Director to any act to be performed by the Inn is required under this Ground Lease (a) the Inn must obtain the consent or approval in writing expressly for purposes of this Ground Lease, regardless of whether a consent or approval shall have been granted by the City in its regulatory, public utility, or other capacity; and (b) unless otherwise expressly stated herein, such consent or approval may be withheld in the exercise of the City's reasonable discretion.

 No permission, consent, or approval of the City or the Director contained herein or given pursuant to this Ground Lease is, or shall be construed as, a representation or assurance that the matter consented to or approved complies with applicable laws, regulations, ordinances or Codes, nor shall any such consent or approval be construed to authorize any failure to comply with any of the foregoing.

 36. MEDIATION OF DISPUTES.

 36.1. Involvement of Mediator & Mediator's Consultants. In the event an issue cannot be resolved by negotiations between subordinate staff of the Inn and Seattle Center, the matter shall be referred to the Director and the Inn Managing Director. If those officials are unable to resolve the dispute within a period of 15 days after the matter has been formally referred to them for resolution, they shall meet during the immediately succeeding seven days to select a mediator to assist in the resolution of such dispute. If the Director and the Inn Managing Director cannot agree upon a mediator within such seven day period, either party may apply to the American Arbitration Association or the Judicial Arbitration & Mediation Service for the appointment of a mediator according to the process that is established by such entity for such action. The Inn and the City shall share equally the cost charged for the mediation of any dispute. The mediator shall have the authority to engage one or more expert consultants with knowledge in the field(s) or area(s) involved in the matter(s) that are in dispute to assist the mediator and the parties to evaluate their respective claims and resolve their dispute.

 36.2. Continuation of Efforts in Event of Dispute; No Litigation without Mediation. Notwithstanding the existence of any dispute between them, the parties shall continue to carry out, without unreasonable delay, all of their respective responsibilities under this Ground Lease which are not affected by the dispute. Neither party to this Ground Lease shall commence any litigation against the other with respect to any claim or dispute arising hereunder without first participating, in good faith, in mediation as contemplated in this Section.

 37. RELATIONSHIP OF PARTIES.

 Nothing contained herein shall be construed as to make the parties hereto partners, associates, joint venturers, or participants in any legal relationship other than that of lessor and lessee. Neither party hereto shall have the power to contract or incur any obligation or liability in the name of the other party.

 38. AMENDMENTS.

 The parties hereto expressly reserve the right to renegotiate and change the provisions of this Ground Lease from time to time as may be necessary. No alteration or modification of the terms or conditions of this Ground Lease shall be valid and binding unless made in writing and signed by the authorized representatives of the parties hereto.

 39. NO WAIVER OF DEFAULT.

 The City does not waive full compliance with the terms and conditions of this Ground Lease by acceptance of rent hereunder. No waiver of default by either party of any of the terms, covenants, and conditions hereof to be performed, kept and observed by the other party shall be construed as, or operate as, a waiver of any subsequent default of any of the terms, covenants and conditions of this Ground Lease to be performed, kept and observed by the other party.

 40. BINDING EFFECT.

 This Ground Lease shall be binding upon the successors and assigns of the parties hereto.

 47.1. Definition of Force Majeure Event.

 47.2. Effect of Force Majeure Event. If either party is rendered wholly or partly unable to perform its material obligations (excluding, however, any monetary obligations) under this Ground Lease within three (3) years from the first occurrence of a Force Majeure Event, then the party whose performance is not so effected may elect to terminate this Ground Lease and such termination shall take effect ninety (90) days following notice thereof. In the event it is the Inn, which is unable to perform its obligations due to a Force Majeure Event, the City may require the Inn to restore the Premises to their original condition in accordance with Subsection 10.15 at the Inn's sole cost and expense.
