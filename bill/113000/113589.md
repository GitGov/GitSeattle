 Section 5. A new section SMC 22.206.305 is added to the Seattle Municipal Code, as follows:

 SMC 22.206.305 Tenant's Private Right of Action.

 Nothing in this Code is intended to affect or limit a tenant's right to pursue a private right of action pursuant to chapter 59.18 RCW for any violation of chapter 59.18 RCW for which that chapter provides a private right of action. When an owner commits an act prohibited by SMC section 22.206.180 A(1), 22.206.180 A (2), or 22.206.180 A(7), a tenant has a private right of action against the owner for actual damages caused by the prohibited act. To the extent that actual damages are unliquidated or difficult to prove, a court may award liquidated damages of up to One Thousand Dollars ($1,000.00) instead of actual damages. Such damages when awarded are to be on a per incident, rather than a per tenant basis. The prevailing party in any such action may recover costs of the suit and attorney fees.

 Section 6. If any provision of this ordinance or its application to any person or circumstance is held invalid, the remainder of the ordinance or the application of the provision to other persons or circumstances is not affected.

 Section 7. This ordinance shall take effect and be in force thirty (30) days from and after its approval by the Mayor, but if not approved and returned by the Mayor within ten (10) days after presentation, it shall take effect as provided by Municipal Code Section 1.04.020.
