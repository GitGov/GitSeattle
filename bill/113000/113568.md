 C. Schedules REC, RLC, RES and RLS and any other form of residential rate assistance established by the Department are not available to those otherwise eligible persons who own their dwelling unit and who use electric heat as defined in Seattle Municipal Code Section 21.52.210 (Ordinance 109675, Section 2) but who have not completed or who are not in the process of completing the energy conservation measures required for participation in the Comprehensive Residential Weatherization Program described in Seattle Municipal Code Section 21.52.260 (Ordinance 109675, Section 8).

Eligibility for residential rate assistance may be continued by the Department, however, if the Department determines that the customer's failure to complete the required energy conservation measures is the fault of the City in failing to furnish or properly administer the Low Income Electric Program set forth in Seattle Municipal Code Section 21.52.250 (Ordinance 109675, Section 7).

 I. All electric service provided for domestic uses to a single residential account, including electrically heated swimming pools, shall have all consumption of electricity added together for billing on Schedules REC, RLC, RES and RLS.
