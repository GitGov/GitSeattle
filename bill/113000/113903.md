 AN ORDINANCE relating to the Police Department; abrogating two positions; establishing two positions, exempt from the Civil Service, of Police Chief, Deputy; and providing payment therefor; all by a two-thirds vote of the City Council.

 WHEREAS, the Seattle Police Department hired the consulting firm of Public Administration Service of McLean, Virginia to among other things, study the approach to, and organization of, policing in Seattle; and

 WHEREAS, based on their review, the consultant has recommended a change in the organizational structure of the Police Department; and

 WHEREAS, the proposed changes will improve the command structure of the Police Department by merging bureaus that need to coordinate their efforts and share resources under the control of a single Deputy Chief; and

 WHEREAS, the proposed changes conform to "best practices" and important lessons learned elsewhere by integrating patrol and investigative functions under a single Deputy Chief; by consolidating all public outreach, public relations, and public affairs functions and expertise under one Assistant Chief; and, recognizing information as a critical organizational resource, drawing all information-related functions together for more effective management and better support of the Department's mission; and

 WHEREAS, the Chief of Police has agreed that a civilian, at least at a level of authority and standing equivalent to that of a sworn Captain, reporting directly to an Assistant Chief, will lead the human resource management efforts of the Police Department, thus ensuring visibility and access as a key decision-maker of the Department; and
