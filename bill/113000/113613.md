 ORDINANCE __________

 BE IT ORDAINED BY THE CITY OF SEATTLE AS FOLLOWS:

 Section 1. Section 2.04.~~180~~370 of the Seattle Municipal Code, as last amended by Ordinance 118569, is amended by adding a new subsection as follows:

~~C~~E. Adjustment Index.

 1. In March of each even-numbered calendar year, the Commission shall promulgate a rule in accordance with Chapter 3.02 of the Seattle Municipal Code. This Rule may increase the dollar amount in Subsection A based on changes in economic conditions as reflected by the Implicit Price Deflator of the United States Domestic Product as published by the United States Department of Commerce Bureau of Economic Analysis ("IPD"). If application of the IPD would result in a decrease in the dollar amount, the dollar amount shall remain unchanged

 2. The new dollar amounts established by the Commission shall be determined by multiplying the base amount provided in this chapter (six hundred dollars) by the percentage change in the most recently published IPD since January 1, 2000. The resulting amount shall be added to the amount derived from the multiplication of the base amount, and the amount resulting from that calculationshall be rounded to the nearest whole dollar amount that can be divided by fifty. In cases where the unrounded amount derived from this procedure is exactly twenty-five dollars different from the two nearest numbers evenly divisible by fifty dollars, the amount shall be rounded up to the next number evenly divisible by fifty dollars. The new dollar amount shall become effective on May 1 of the even- numbered calendar year. Once adopted, any increase in the contribution limit shall be effective for all election cycles that have not ended by May 1 of that even-numbered year.

 3. This subsection shall expire six years after the effective date of the enabling ordinance.

 Section 2. This ordinance shall take effect and be in force thirty (30) days from and after its approval by the Mayor, but if not approved and returned by the Mayor within ten (10) days after presentation, it shall take effect as provided by Municipal Code Section 1.04.020.
