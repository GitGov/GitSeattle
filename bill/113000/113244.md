 AN ORDINANCE relating to parks and open space; authorizing the Executive to enter into a Design Agreement with the Seattle Art Museum; authorizing the expenditure of certain capital improvement project funds; making an appropriation from the Shoreline Park Improvement Fund; and directing the Executive to present a financing plan for City improvements associated with Olympic Sculpture Park; all by a three-fourths vote of the City Council.

 WHEREAS, the City of Seattle Comprehensive Plan, the Seattle Parks and Recreation COMPLAN, the Downtown Plan and the downtown neighborhood plans identify the desire for additional public open space and the desire for public space for the arts that is free to the public; and

 WHEREAS, the City of Seattle has experienced substantial recent commercial and residential development in the downtown neighborhoods without significant additional development of public open space or public space for display of art and cultural resources; and

 WHEREAS, substantial increases in downtown development densities are anticipated in the next decade which will decrease opportunities for acquisition and development of public open space and public space for the arts; and

 WHEREAS, the Cultural Resources Element of the Comprehensive Plan specifically supports the concentration of regional cultural facilities in downtown Seattle and the Seattle Center, and in general supports development of cultural facilities such as museums and art exhibition facilities in urban centers; and

 WHEREAS, the Seattle Art Museum (SAM) acquired two upland parcels and one tideland parcel from Union Oil Company of California ("Unocal") in December, 1999. SAM and the Trust for Public Land have worked in partnership to raise private funds toward the development of the Olympic Sculpture Park, establishing an initial fundraising goal of $37 million and raising $29.3 million as of February 2000; and

 WHEREAS, SAM is in the process of developing design criteria, a physical program and an artistic program that contemplates use of the upland parcels as a sculpture park and use of the tideland parcel to preserve views of Puget Sound and the Olympic mountains. The Olympic Sculpture Park, an open space dedicated to outdoor sculpture on the downtown Seattle waterfront, will generally be open to the public; and

 WHEREAS, it will be beneficial and desirable to the accomplishment of City and neighborhood objectives, to develop a joint design project that coordinates City Park access and connections to and through the Olympic Sculpture Park; and

 WHEREAS, on December 7, 1999, the City and SAM executed an agreement addressing responsibility for contamination of rights-of-way and certain other matters related to development and operation of a public sculpture park. In that agreement, SAM agreed to provide free public access to the sculpture park in perpetuity (with the exception of scheduled closings for special events and to perform other site management responsibilities). That agreement further contemplated a future agreement in which SAM and the City would cooperatively fund and jointly participate in the design of SAM's Olympic Sculpture Park and the City's adjacent and nearby redevelopment of Myrtle Edwards Park, Alaskan Way and other adjacent City facilities and rights-of- way; and

 WHEREAS, SAM has budgeted an estimated $500,000 for such a design project and the City can realize a significant benefit in the more efficient master planning of its interests, by coordinating its planning for its adjacent and nearby redevelopment of City facilities (including Myrtle Edwards Park, Alaskan Way and other adjacent rights- of-way) with SAM; and

 WHEREAS, the Seattle Transportation Department has received a grant from the State of Washington Transportation Improvement Board to study north waterfront access improvements at this vicinity; and

 WHEREAS, Ordinance 119482 appropriated $500,000 to the Executive Services Department for preliminary studies and engineering of emergent potential capital projects; and

 WHEREAS, a design project that integrates design of the new sculpture park with existing park space and identifies comprehensive solutions to improve public access to the waterfront and surrounding neighborhoods will greatly enhance the quality of new and existing public spaces in the north waterfront area;

 NOW THEREFORE,

 BE IT ORDAINED BY THE CITY OF SEATTLE AS FOLLOWS:

 Section 1.

 OSP-ORD 5/30/00 V 1

 DESIGN AGREEMENT for THE OLYMPIC SCULPTURE PARK AND MYRTLE EDWARDS PARK INTEGRATION between THE CITY OF SEATTLE and THE SEATTLE ART MUSEUM

 This Agreement is dated _____________, 2000, and is entered into by and between the City of Seattle, ("City") a Washington municipal corporation, and the Seattle Art Museum ("SAM"), a Washington nonprofit corporation.

 1. RECITALS

 1.1 SAM currently operates two visual arts facilities, the downtown museum and the Seattle Asian Art Museum in Volunteer Park.

 1.2 SAM has proposed development of a third facility on Seattle's downtown waterfront to be dedicated to the exhibition of outdoor sculpture.

 1.3 SAM and the Trust for Public Land (TPL), a national nonprofit land conservation organization, worked in partnership to raise private funds for land acquisition and capital costs needed to develop a sculpture park. As of February 23, 2000, $29.3 million had been raised from private sources towards a preliminary budget goal of $37 million.

 1.4 In December 1999, SAM purchased a 7.4-acre property from the Union Oil Company of California ("Unocal"), consisting of two upland parcels and one tideland parcel. It was also announced that the sculpture park would be officially known as the Seattle Art Museum's Olympic Sculpture Park ("Sculpture Park").

 1.5 Prior to the land purchase, SAM entered into a prospective purchaser agreement with the Washington State Department of Ecology governing liability and cleanup requirements related to the property's environmental conditions, including portions of some of the adjacent rights-of-way.

 1.6 In July 1999, the Seattle City Council adopted Resolution 30001 authorizing and directing City agencies to develop policies, programs and funding strategies necessary to develop the Sculpture Park.

 1.7 In November 1999, the Seattle City Council adopted Resolution 30089 supporting the Executive's decision to enter into an agreement addressing responsibility for contamination in rights-of-way and certain other matters related to development and operation of a public sculpture park. The resolution further resolved that the Executive should "work cooperatively with the Seattle Art Museum in the development of a master plan that will guide the development of the sculpture park, adjoining rights-of-way and Myrtle Edwards Park."

 1.8 In December 1999, The City and SAM executed an agreement addressing responsibility for contamination in rights-of-way and certain other matters related to development and operation of a public sculpture park (hereafter, the December 1999 Agreement). In the December 1999 Agreement, SAM agreed to provide free public access to the sculpture park with the exception of scheduled closings for special events and to perform other site management responsibilities. The Parties agreed to cooperatively fund and develop a master plan to guide the future design and development of the tidelands, Myrtle Edwards Park and adjacent rights-of-ways in a manner consistent with the sculpture park, and to cooperate in raising funds to develop, operate and maintain the park.

 1.9 In March 2000, Seattle Public Utilities sponsored a salmon- friendly design workshop to promote concepts in landscape design and site restoration to help protect and restore salmon habitat in the urban environment. A Puget Sound shoreline restoration site (inclusive of the Olympic Sculpture Park Site, the Alaskan Way right- of-way, Myrtle Edwards Park and Elliott Bay Park) was used to demonstrate possible habitat improvements for juvenile Chinook and other species.

 1.10 In March 2000, the Seattle Transportation Department (hereafter "SEATRAN") issued a request for proposals for its North Waterfront Access Project. The project will consider issues of access to and from the waterfront and surrounding neighborhoods in the vicinity of the Olympic Sculpture Park for pedestrians, bicyclists and motor vehicles. The scope of the project includes preliminary engineering of a variety of alternatives, ranging from traffic management measures to new roadway structures, aimed at reducing congestion and mode conflicts associated with operations of the existing at-grade mainline railroad tracks.

 1.11 The Parties wish to continue their cooperative efforts and to develop a master plan that provides for both the physical and aesthetic integration of the Olympic Sculpture Park, the Alaskan Way right-of-way (between Bay and Broad Streets) and Myrtle Edwards Park. Towards this end and as provided in this Agreement, SAM shall manage a design process (hereafter, the "Design Project"), with the participation of the City, that results in a final design concept for the Olympic Sculpture Park, the Alaskan Way right-of-way, and suggested improvements to Myrtle Edwards Park.

 ACCORDINGLY, the City and SAM agree as follows:

 2. DESIGN CRITERIA, PHYSICAL PROGRAM & ARTISTIC PROGRAM

 2.1 Preliminary Design Principles

 SAM shall direct the design of the Sculpture Park in consideration of the following preliminary design principles as developed by SAM and endorsed by the City of Seattle:

 * The Olympic Sculpture Park will be designed as an extraordinary setting for sculpture of a high artistic standard;

 * It will be a comfortable, inviting environment that is welcoming to a broad community;

 * The site will be designed to establish a physical and thematic connection between the sculpture park and Myrtle Edwards Park;

 * The design will include native plants as landscaping and will seek to promote creative solutions to the restoration of shoreline habitat;

 * The park is envisioned as one link in a chain of cultural sites and public parks in north downtown, including the Odyssey Maritime Center, the Pacific Northwest Aquarium, the Experience Music Project, the Pacific Science Center and South Lake Union Park;

 6. COORDINATION WITH THE NORTH WATERFRONT ACCESS PROJECT

 6.1 Project Summary

 Seattle Transportation (SEATRAN) is proceeding with the North Waterfront Access Project, including community outreach, civil/urban/architectural design, and environmental services to determine the need and feasibility of transportation improvements for motor vehicles, bicycles, and pedestrians in the vicinity of the sculpture park, while meeting the urban design challenges of the area. The Transportation Improvement Board of the State of Washington has provided project funding for this project.

 6.2 Coordination

 In recognition of the close relationship between the transportation and urban design issues under study in the North Waterfront Access Project and the Design Project, the City and SAM agree to closely coordinate these projects. These coordinated efforts are expected to include (but shall not be limited to):

 * Regular meetings between the project managers for each project;

 * Coordinated presentations to community and business groups, when appropriate;

 * A joint design workshop including members of the consultant teams for each project and representatives of the city agencies serving as advisors to the Design Project; and

 * An iterative process of developing recommendations and design concepts for transportation connections, whereby the interim findings of each project are made available to the other.

 Notwithstanding this agreement to provide close coordination and a desire to reach consensus on key issues, SAM and SEATRAN shall reach their final conclusions independently and are not obligated to reach consensus.

 7. COORDINATION WITH THE LAKE UNION/DENNY WAY COMBINED SEWER OVERFLOW PROJECT

 7.1 Project Background

 The City maintains a network of drainage systems located throughout the Seattle area, including combined sewers. Combined sewers are designed with overflow pipes so that during heavy rains, excess water in the system will flow into lakes and streams rather than back-up into houses. A collector system connects to large trunk lines that flow into the larger system, operated by the Water Pollution Control Division of the King County Department of Natural Resources. Most of Seattle's sewage flows to the West Point Treatment Plant. Following treatment, wastewater from West Point is discharged into the deep waters of Puget Sound. Uncontrolled overflows of the system pollute the shoreline and waters of Puget Sound.

 Over the next several years, the DennyWay/Lake Union combined sewer overflow (CSO) will be upgraded to control overflows through a joint City-King County project. This Denny Way/Lake Union CSO project is part of the City's overall CSO control plan, adopted in response to state regulations requiring control of CSOs.

 7.2 Coordination of CSO Project Improvements with the Master Plan

 The City and SAM will engage King County and Seattle Public Utilities in the design process and identify opportunities to coordinate the design of the CSO mitigation and restoration activities in the planning area.

 8. COORDINATION WITH PORT OF SEATTLE

 The City and SAM will engage the Port of Seattle in the design process and identify opportunities to coordinate with Port projects and activities in this area.

 9. NON-DISCRIMINATION & UTILIZATION OF WOMEN- AND MINORITY OWNED BUSINESS ENTERPRISES

 SAM shall comply, and shall require all consultants and subconsultants performing work under the Design Project, and any contractors and subcontractors under construction contracts resulting from this Design Agreement, to comply with the following provisions:

 9.1 Non-Discrimination

 SAM and any consultants, subconsultants, contractors, and subcontractors, will not discriminate against any employee or applicant for employment because of race, religion, creed, age, color, sex, marital status, sexual orientation, gender identity, political ideology, ancestry, national origin, or the presence of any sensory, mental or physical handicap, unless based upon a bona fide occupational qualification. SAM and any consultants, subconsultants, contractors, and subcontractors, will take affirmative action to ensure that applicants are employed, and that employees are treated during employment, without regard to their creed, religion, race, age, color, sex, national origin, marital status, political ideology, ancestry, sexual orientation, gender identity, or the presence of any sensory, mental or physical handicap. Such action shall include, but not be limited to the following: employment, upgrading, demotion, or transfer; recruitment or recruitment advertising; layoff or termination; rates of pay or other forms of compensation; and selection for training, including apprenticeship. All City contracts, and these provisions, must be consistent with Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, and the Civil Rights Restoration Act of 1987 (P.L. 100.259).

 9.2 Utilization of Women- and Minority Owned Business Enterprises

 The City encourages the utilization of Minority Business Enterprises ("MBEs") and Women's Business Enterprises ("WBEs") (collectively, "WMBEs") in all City contracts. SAM, and all consultants, subconsultants, contractors, and subcontractors, shall not create barriers to open and fair opportunities for WMBEs to participate in, obtain or compete for contracts and subcontracts as sources of supplies, equipment, construction and services.

 9.3 Additional City Requirements During Subsequent Construction Phases

 Under any construction project subsequently undertaken by SAM as a result of this Design Project, SAM agrees: (1) to comply with the provisions of the City's Apprenticeship Program (Seattle Municipal Code Ch. 20.38) and (2) to comply with the provisions of the City's "Boost" Program (Ordinance 119602), as now or hereafter amended.
