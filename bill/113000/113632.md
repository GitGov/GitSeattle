 WHEREAS the primary mission of the Seattle Housing Authority is to enhance the Seattle community by creating and sustaining decent, safe and affordable living environments that foster stability and increase self-sufficiency for people with low incomes; and

 WHEREAS the State Housing Cooperation Law (RCW Chapter 35.83) recognizes the public purpose and essential governmental function served by housing authorities, and allows the City to zone or rezone, and make exception to building regulations and ordinances to aid in the development of housing by such authorities;

 NOW, THEREFORE,

 BE IT ORDAINED BY THE CITY OF SEATTLE AS FOLLOWS:

 Section 1. Subsection E of Section 23.47.004 of the Seattle Municipal Code, which Section was last amended by Ordinance 120117, is amended to read as follows:

 23.47.004 Permitted and prohibited uses.

 * * *

 E. Residential Uses.

 1. Residential Use in Single-purpose Residential Structures.  The term "single-purpose residential structure" may include a structure with both residential and non-residential uses, but does not include an assisted living facility or any structure that is part of a mixed-use development meeting the standards in Section 23.47.008. Residential use in single-purpose residential structures is permitted as an administrative conditional use, unless:

 a. The structure is located within an area in which the use is either permitted outright or prohibited, as shown on the Maps 23.47.004 A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, and I;

 b. The structure is located in a pedestrian-designated zone, in which case residential use prohibited at street level along the designated principal pedestrian street as provided in Section 23.47.042;

 c. The structure is located within a zone which has a height limit of eighty-five (85) feet or higher, in which case single-purpose residential structures are prohibited;

 d. The residential use is a nursing home, in which case it is permitted outright unless prohibited as provided in subsection E1b~~.~~;

e. The structure is developed and owned by the Seattle Housing Authority, and is located on a lot owned by the Seattle Housing Authority as of May 1, 2001, in which case the residential use is permitted outright, except in a zone that has a height limit of eighty-five (85) feet or higher, and except that when the structure is located in a pedestrian-designated zone, street level use requirements apply along the designated principal pedestrian street as provided in Section 23.47.042;  f. The structure is in a part of the International Special Review District east of the Interstate 5 Freeway, in which case residential use is permitted outright as provided in Section 23.66.330; or

 g. The structure, in any commercial zone, is for a low-income housing project and:

 (1) An application for a reservation of tax credits for 1988 and 1989 under the low-income tax credit program administered by the Washington State Housing Finance Commission was filed on or before March 15, 1988; or

 (2) A nonprofit corporation purchased sites, signed options or entered into a real estate purchase agreement prior to March 15, 1988, in either of which cases the residential use is permitted outright.

* * *

Section 2. Subsection B of Section 23.47.006 of the Seattle Municipal Code, which Section was last amended by Ordinance 119217, is amended to read as follows:

 23.47.006 Conditional uses.

 * * *

 B. The following uses, identified as administrative conditional uses on Chart A of Section 23.47.004, may be permitted by the Director when the provisions of this subsection and subsection A are met:

 1. Fast-food restaurants which have a gross floor area greater than seven hundred fifty (750) square feet are identified as heavy traffic generators and may be permitted as a conditional use according to the following criteria:

 a. The design of the structure, including architectural treatment, signage, landscaping and lighting, is compatible with other structures in the vicinity; and

 b. Appropriate litter-control measures are provided; and

 c. The applicant, if required by the Director, prepares an analysis of traffic, circulation and parking impacts, and demonstrates that the use does not:

 (1) Cause significant additional traffic to circulate through adjacent residential neighborhoods, or

 (2) Disrupt the pedestrian character of an area by significantly increasing the potential for pedestrian-vehicle conflicts, or

 (3) Create traffic or access problems which will require the expenditure of City funds to mitigate, or

 (4) Interfere with peak-hour transit operations, by causing auto traffic to cross a designated high-occupancy vehicle lane adjacent to the lot, or

 (5) Cause cars waiting to use the facility to queue across the sidewalk or onto the street, or

 (6) Interrupt established retail or service frontage designed to serve pedestrians;

 d. In addition to the criteria in subsections B1a, B1b and B1c, in pedestrian-designated zones, the use shall not:

 (1) Include a drive-in facility, or

 (2) Provide any accessory parking, or

 (3) Attract a significant number of customers who drive to the pedestrian district for the primary purpose of patronizing the business. This shall be determined by a transportation analysis of travel modes and patterns of customers of similar businesses in the same or similar commercial areas, which shall be prepared by a traffic consultant retained by the applicant;

 e. Fast-food restaurants which are drive-in businesses shall also comply with the provisions of Section 23.47.028, Standards for drive-in businesses.

 2. Taverns and brewpubs in NC1 and NC2 zones may be permitted as conditional uses. A tavern or brewpub in an NC1 or NC2 zone shall be evaluated according to the following criteria:

 a. The size of the tavern or brewpub, design of the structure, signing and illumination shall be compatible with the character of the commercial area and other structures in the vicinity, particularly in areas where a distinct and definite pattern or style has been established.

 b. The location, access and design of parking shall be compatible with adjacent residential zones.

 c. Special consideration shall be given to the location and design of the doors and windows of taverns and brewpubs to ensure that noise standards will not be exceeded. The Director may require additional setbacks and/or restrict openings on lots which abut residential zones.

 d. Taverns and brewpubs shall not generate traffic which creates traffic congestion or further aggravates spillover parking on residential streets.

 3. Park-and-ride lots in NC3, C1 and C2 zones may be permitted as conditional uses.

 a. Conditional Use Criteria.

 (1) The park-and-ride lot shall have direct vehicular access to a designated arterial improved to City standards.

 (2) If the proposed park-and-ride lot is located on a lot containing accessory parking for other uses, there shall be no substantial conflict in the principal operating hours of the park- and-ride lot and the other uses.

 b. Mitigating Measures. Landscaping and screening in addition to that required for surface parking areas, noise mitigation, vehicular access controls, signage restrictions, and other measures may be required to provide comfort and safety for pedestrians and bicyclists and to insure the compatibility of the park-and-ride lot with the surrounding area.

 4. Single-purpose ~~R~~residential ~~S~~s tructures may be permitted outright, permitted as an administrative conditional use or prohibited as provided by Section 23.47.004 E. In order to conserve the limited amount of commercially zoned land for commercial uses, single-purpose residential structures shall generally not be allowed in commercial zones. However, additions to, or on-site accessory structures for, existing single-family structures are permitted outright. Where single-purpose residential structures may be permitted as an administrative conditional use, such a permit may be granted only when the following circumstances exist:

 a. Due to location or parcel size, the proposed site is not suited for commercial development; or

 b. There is substantial excess supply of land available for commercial use near the proposed site, evidenced by such conditions as a lack of commercial activity in existing commercial structures for a sustained period, commercial structures in disrepair, and vacant or underused commercially zoned land; provided that single- purpose residential development shall not interrupt an established commercial street front. As used in this subsection, an "established commercial street front" may be intersected by streets or alleys, and some lots with no current commercial use.

 5. Residential Uses in C2 Zones.

 a. In order to conserve the limited amount of commercially zoned land for commercial uses, residential uses in single-purpose or mixed-use structures shall generally not be allowed in C2 zones. However, additions to, or on-site accessory structures for, existing single-family structures shall be permitted outright. Residential uses in single-purpose or mixed-use structures may be permitted in C2 zones as administrative conditional uses according to the following criteria:

 (1) Availability of Suitable Land for C2 Activities. Residential uses shall generally be discouraged in areas which have limited vacant land and where, due to terrain and large parcel size, land is particularly suitable for commercial rather than residential development.

 (2) Relationship to Transportation Systems. Residential uses shall generally be discouraged in areas with direct access to major transportation systems such as freeways, state routes and freight rail lines.

 (3) Compatibility With Surrounding Areas. Residential uses shall not be allowed in close proximity to industrial areas and/or in areas where nonresidential uses may create a nuisance or adversely affect the desirability of the area for living purposes.

 b. Residential uses required to obtain a shoreline conditional use shall not be required to obtain an administrative conditional use.

~~6. Residential Use in International Special Review District. Single-purpose residential structures shall be permitted outright in those parts of the International Special Review District east of the Interstate 5 Freeway as provided in Section 23.66.330.~~7. Low-income Housing Projects. Single-purpose residential structures for low-income housing projects shall be permitted outright in all commercial zones if:

 a. Applications for a reservation of tax credits for 1988 and 1989 under the low-income tax credit program administered by the Washington State Housing Finance Commission have been filed on or before March 15, 1988; or

 b. A nonprofit corporation has purchased sites, signed options or entered into real estate purchase agreements prior to March 15, 1988.

~~~~~~8~~6. Development of a medical service use over ten thousand (10,000) square feet, outside but within two thousand five hundred (2,500) feet of a medical Major Institution overlay district boundary, shall be subject to administrative conditional use approval, unless included in an adopted master plan. In making a determination whether to approve or deny a medical service use, the Director shall determine whether an adequate supply of commercially zoned land for businesses serving neighborhood residents will continue to exist. The following factors shall be used in making this determination:

 a. Whether the amount of medical service use development existing and proposed in the vicinity would reduce the current viability or significantly impact the longer-term potential of the neighborhood- serving character of the commercial area; and

 b. Whether medical service use development would displace existing neighborhood-serving commercial uses at street level or disrupt a continuous commercial street front, particularly of retail and personal services uses, or significantly detract from an area's overall neighborhood-serving commercial character.

~~9~~7. Change of One Nonconforming Use to Another.

 a. A nonconforming use may be converted by an administrative conditional use authorization to a use not otherwise permitted in the zone based on the following factors:

 (1) New uses shall be limited to those first permitted in the next more intensive zone;

 (2) The relative impacts of size, parking, traffic, light, glare, noise, odor and similar impacts of the two (2) uses, and how these impacts could be mitigated.

 b. The Director must find that the new nonconforming use is no more detrimental to property in the zone and vicinity than the existing nonconforming use.

 * * *

 Section 3. Subsection B of Section 23.47.009 of the Seattle Municipal Code, which Section was last amended by Ordinance 120117, is amended to read as follows:

 23.47.009 Density limits for residential uses.

 * * *

 B. Density limits in this section shall not apply for single-purpose residential structures along selected streets in the Pike/Pine Overlay District, pursuant to Chapter 23.73, and for Seattle Housing Authority structures permitted pursuant to Section 23.47.004 E1e.

 * * *

 Section 4. Subsection A of Section 23.47.023 of the Seattle Municipal Code, which Section was last amended by Ordinance 119239, is amended, and a new subsection D is added to that Section, to read as follows:

 23.47.023 Standards for single-purpose residential structures.

 A. In all commercial zones, single-purpose residential structures shall be subject to the density standards provided for in Section 23.47.009, except as provided for in the Northgate Overlay District, Chapter 23.71, and in the Pike/Pine Overlay District, Chapter 23.73, and except for Seattle Housing Authority development permitted pursuant to Section 23.47.004 E1e.

 * * *

D. A single-purpose residential structure developed pursuant to Section 23.47.004 E1e shall meet all development standards applicable to mixed use development, except that Section 23.47.008 B shall not apply, and that the structure at street level shall not be required to meet the minimum thirteen foot (13') floor to floor height specified in Section 23.47.008 C2.

Section 5. The provisions of this ordinance are declared to be separate and severable. The invalidity of any particular provision shall not affect the validity of any other provision.

 Section 6. This ordinance shall take effect and be in force thirty (30) days from and after its approval by the Mayor, but if not approved and returned by the Mayor within ten (10) days after presentation, it shall take effect as provided by Municipal Code Section 1.04.020.
