 ORDINANCE __________________

 AN ORDINANCE relating to the Office of Housing, accepting and appropriating grant funds from Freddie Mac; amending the 2001 Budget of the Office of Housing; and ratifying and confirming prior acts.

 WHEREAS, many cities and communities have experienced a ten-fold increase in the number of subprime mortgage loans since 1993, according to a recently published report by the Department of Housing and Urban Development; and

 WHEREAS, several federal regulators and others recognize that a subset of subprime lenders engages in predatory lending, which includes unscrupulous lending practices involving misleading marketing and high pressure lending tactics, excessive fees, exorbitant interest rates, and hidden loan terms; and

 WHEREAS, these lending practices strip hard-earned equity from homeowners, including senior citizens, putting them at risk of foreclosure and damaging their credit ratings; and

 WHEREAS, Freddie Mac has launched a national campaign to alert home owners and home buyers about predatory lending risks; and

 WHEREAS, Freddie Mac has made available to The City of Seattle a grant of $25,000 for activities intended to prevent predatory lending practices in Seattle;

The money when received shall be deposited in the Low-Income Housing Fund (164), Housing Grant Programs Subfund (16460). The Mayor or Director of OH is authorized to execute, for and on behalf of The City of Seattle, a grant agreement and such other documents and assurances as Freddie Mac may require for such purpose. The agreements and such other documents shall be in form and content consistent with the City Charter and other applicable law.

Contingent upon the receipt of grant funds identified in Section 1, the expenditure allowance in the 2001 Budget of the Office of Housing is increased by the appropriation, hereby made and authorized, of the sum of Twenty-Five Thousand and No/100 Dollars ($25,000.00) from the Low-Income Housing Fund (164), Housing Grant Programs Subfund (16460). Any unexpended and unencumbered balance of this appropriation shall be carried forward to 2002 unless expressly abandoned by ordinance.
