 AN ORDINANCE relating to the Seattle Center Department; authorizing interim bridge financing for the McCaw Hall project; and increasing appropriation authority in the 1999 Seattle Center/Community Centers Fund for the construction phase of the McCaw Hall project; all upon a three-fourths vote of the City Council.

 WHEREAS, on November 2, 1999, the voters of Seattle approved a special property tax levy lid lift to provide $29,000,000 toward the renovation of the Opera House into the Performance Hall (now known as Marion Oliver McCaw Hall) at Seattle Center; and

 WHEREAS, the City Council adopted Ordinance 119520 authorizing the issuance of up to $9 million of Councilmanic bonds as additional funding for the renovation of the Opera House; and

 WHEREAS, the City Council adopted Ordinance 119931 in May 2000, authorizing an agreement with the Seattle Center Foundation to raise $55 million in private funds for the McCaw Hall project and designating a City Financial Representative (subsequently designated as the City's Finance Director) to review and approve the validity of private pledges for the project; and

 WHEREAS, the Seattle Center Foundation subsequently increased the private fundraising goal for the McCaw Hall project to $72 million, for a total project budget of $127.78 million; and

 WHEREAS, the City Council has adopted Ordinances 119811, 120125, and 120165, authorizing appropriations of $25,791,000, in the aggregate, for the McCaw Hall project; and

 WHEREAS, the City Council adopted Resolution 30303 on April 2, 2001, establishing two funding thresholds for the McCaw Hall project to proceed: Threshold One required $40 million in private pledges prior to the issuance of a Notice to Proceed for work in the Mercer Arena and for early construction elements while the Opera House is still open, and Threshold Two, which requires total public and private funding commitments of $100 million prior to the issuance of a Notice to Proceed for the full renovation of the Opera House; and

 WHEREAS, on May 10, 2001, the City Finance Director certified that Threshold One had been met, allowing for work to proceed in the Mercer Arena and for early construction elements while the Opera House is still open; and

 WHEREAS, the construction schedule for the McCaw Hall project is determined in part by performances which must be scheduled several years in advance and in order for the project to stay on schedule, Notice to Proceed for the full renovation of the Opera House must be issued by the end of September 2001; and

 WHEREAS, Seattle Center received $2 million in State funds for redevelopment of the Opera House in the 2001 State legislative session; and

 WHEREAS, Seattle Center still expects to receive a total of $12 million of State funds for the renovation, but over a longer time than originally planned, necessitating interim or "bridge" financing to provide for the potential delay in State funding in the 2001-03 biennium and consequent shortfall on a cashflow basis; and

 WHEREAS, on August 8, 2001, the City's Debt Management Policy Advisory Committee approved Seattle Center's proposal for up to $4.75 million in bridge financing for the McCaw Hall project; NOW THEREFORE,

 BE IT ORDAINED BY THE CITY OF SEATTLE AS FOLLOWS:

 Section 1. The City Council hereby authorizes up to $4.75 million in interim financing for the McCaw Hall project for State funds that are anticipated but not yet received. The final amount and term of this interim financing will be established in a subsequent ordinance.

 Section 2. It is the City Council's intent that the principal amount of the interim financing authorized in Section 1 above be repaid from State funds. If State funds are not available for this purpose at the time of repayment, it is the City Council's intent that repayment be made from other non-City funds. If non-City funds are not available for this purpose at the time of repayment, it is the City Council's intent that repayment be made from Seattle Center's Capital Improvement Program or from a Seattle Center Department revenue source, over a term of up to twenty years.

 Section 3. As requested by the Seattle Center Director and recommended by the Mayor, the sum of Ninety-Seven Million Two Hundred Sixty Four Thousand Dollars ($97,264,000) is hereby appropriated from the 1999 Seattle Center/Community Centers Fund, Seattle Center Subfund (33820) to the Marion Oliver McCaw Hall Project (S0001), contingent upon the City's Finance Director certifying that the Threshold Two funding level has been reached, in accordance with Resolution 30303.

 Section 4. The Director of Seattle Center is authorized, upon compliance with State laws and City ordinances, to proceed with construction activities for the McCaw Hall project.

 Section 5. The foregoing appropriations are made to meet actual necessary expenditures of the City for which no appropriation has been made due to causes which could not reasonably have been foreseen at the time of the adoption of the 2001 Budget.

 Section 6. Any act consistent with the authority and prior to the effective date of this ordinance is hereby ratified and confirmed.

 Section 7. This ordinance shall take effect and be in force thirty (30) days from and after its approval by the Mayor, but if not approved and returned by the Mayor within ten (10) days after presentation, it shall take effect as provided by Municipal Code Section 1.04.020.
