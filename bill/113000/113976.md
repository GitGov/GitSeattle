 WHEREAS, the City Council believes that the purpose of the Program, which is to increase the participation of small. businesses in City construction projects, will be better served by amending the Seattle Municipal Code to change the enrollment requirements for Boost, as recommended by Task Force.

 Section 1. Section 20.49.010 of the Seattle Municipal Code, most recently amended by Ordinance 120021, is further amended as follows:

 SMC 20.49.010 Findings.

 The City Council finds the following:

 A. The success of small economically disadvantaged businesses is important to the region's overall economy, including the development of job opportunities and social mobility ~~in the City~~.

~~B. Businesses located within the City that seek contracting opportunities operate under a competitive disadvantage with businesses located elsewhere in the State of Washington because of higher taxes and higher operating and administrative costs (including, but not limited to, higher costs of acquisition and/or leasing of property).~~

~~C~~B. Economic justice is served by enhancing opportunities for small economically disadvantaged business owners ~~who pursue relevant technical and entrepreneurial training~~ to become more skilled competitors.

~~D. Businesses located in King County provide a significant benefit to the economy of the City.~~

~~E~~C. Through its contracting activities, the City is in a position to create important economic incentives to use small economically disadvantaged businesses.

~~F~~D. It is in the City's economic interest to provide incentives to encourage small economically disadvantaged businesses to successfully do business with, and in, the City~~locate and remain within the City~~.

 Section 2. Section 20.49.020 of the Seattle Municipal Code, most recently amended by Ordinance 119602, is further amended as follows:

 SMC 20.49.020 Boost for small economically disadvantaged businesses.

 The ~~Executive Services Department ("ESD")~~Department of Finance ("Department") shall implement a "Boost" Program under which the City and its contractors have either an incentive or requirement, to make use of small economically disadvantaged businesses as prime contractors, subcontractors, and suppliers on City contracts.as determined by the Department

 Section 3. Section 20.49.040 of the Seattle Municipal Code, most recently amended by Ordinance 120021, is further amended as follows:

 2. Lists the address on a valid business permit as being within the relevant boundaries; and

 3. Has been doing business within the relevant boundaries for at least twelve (12) months; and

 4. Submits other proof as required by the Director.

 "Small economically disadvantaged business" means that a business and the person or persons who own and control it are in a financial condition which puts the business at a substantial disadvantage in attempting to compete for public contracts. In assessing these financial conditions, ~~ESD)~~the Department shall substantially adopt the approach used by the federal Small Business Administration ("SBA"), provided that the SBA dollar ceilings for various standard business classifications ~~and levels for owners' personal net worth~~ shall be adjusted by the Director to account for local market conditions as appropriate.
