 ORDINANCE ___________

 AN ORDINANCE related to the Municipal Civic Center; declaring surplus and authorizing the sale and partial leaseback of property at 710 Second Avenue, commonly known as the Dexter Horton Building; directing the deposit of proceeds of the sale; authorizing the Finance Director to take action with respect to a portion of the sale proceeds in order to preserve the tax exempt status of bonds issued to refinance the City's acquisition of the Dexter Horton Building; and making appropriations in connection with the sale and partial leaseback of the Dexter Horton Building; all by a three- fourths vote of the City Council.

 WHEREAS, Ordinance 117739 authorized the purchase of Key Tower for housing general government, City Light, and other utility offices, saving an estimated $90 million as compared to the alternative of renovating the Municipal and Public Safety Buildings; and

 WHEREAS, Resolution 29795 provided guidance for the creation of a Municipal Civic Center Master Plan, which included researching re- use strategies for the Dexter Horton and Alaska Buildings; and

 WHEREAS, Resolution 29953 endorsed "Concept 4" as the preferred alternative among the options set forth in the Civic Center Master Plan, proposing the use of Key Tower for most City office functions, a new City Hall on the current Municipal building site, public/private development on the north half of the Public Safety Building site, open space, and a plaza on the north side of James Street from 5th to 3rd Avenues, linkages to the new Courthouse/Police Administration building, the Arctic Building and the Metro Tunnel, and the disposition of excess properties; and

 WHEREAS, one of the Municipal Civic Center Master Plan's goals is to realize revenue from the sale or lease of assets that are no longer needed to meet the City's space needs; and

 WHEREAS, following a March 1999 review of City departments' space programming requirements, the Mayor and City Council agreed that City offices currently occupying the Dexter Horton Building would eventually move to Key Tower or other City facilities and, therefore, that it was prudent to dispose of the Dexter Horton Building; and

 WHEREAS, Resolution 29612 reaffirmed the Mayor and City Council's support for preserving the Dexter Horton Building and protecting its historic character; and

 WHEREAS, notice of the availability of the Dexter Horton Building has been circulated to City departments and other government agencies, but no City department or government agency has indicated an interest in owning or having jurisdiction over the property; and

 WHEREAS, the master schedule for relocating City departments and offices into Key Tower contemplates that the City will continue to occupy portions of the Dexter Horton Building until the programmed space at Key Tower becomes available; and

 WHEREAS, Resolution 30023 requested the Executive Services Department to offer the Dexter Horton Building for sale through a competitive process, for office space use; and

 WHEREAS, the Executive Services Department, through its real estate advisor for the Civic Center project, conducted a publicly- advertised competitive process for the sale of the Dexter Horton Building to one or more qualified investors; and

 WHEREAS, after extensive evaluation of all offers and negotiations with the entity that submitted the highest and most responsive offer for the Dexter Horton Building, the Executive Services Department recommends that the Dexter Horton Building be declared surplus and sold subject to a lease of portions of such building for occupancy by certain City departments for varying periods of time that last into 2006; and

 WHEREAS, federal income tax laws and rules require that to preserve the exemption from federal income tax of interest paid on certain City bonds issued to refinance the acquisition of the Dexter Horton Building when that building is sold, the City must either defease those bonds or restrict its use of the sale proceeds properly allocable to those bonds to an alternative governmental capital use, an action referred to by the applicable federal regulations as a "remedial action" with respect to the "disposition proceeds;" and

 WHEREAS, the "disposition proceeds," as defined by the applicable federal regulations, are presently estimated to be approximately $20,560,496, or 65.23% of the outstanding 1992 refunding bonds; and

 WHEREAS, the City intends to spend at least ten percent (10%) of the "disposition proceeds" on capital costs of the Civic Center project within six (6) months after the sale of the Dexter Horton Building; and

 WHEREAS, in order to fairly allocate the cost of debt service on the 1992 and 1998 refunding bonds attributable to just the Dexter Horton Building, which is presently estimated to be 65.23% of the share of total debt service on those 1992 and 1998 refunding bonds attributable to the Dexter Horton, Alaska, and Arctic Buildings, the Municipal Civic Center Fund's 2000 Budget should be increased to pay that debt service; and

 WHEREAS, the conceptual public art by John Baldessari, "A Sixteenth View of Seattle at Sixteen Locations," was designed specifically for the Dexter Horton Building and is appropriately transferred with the building to the new owner; and

 WHEREAS, a portion of the proceeds from the sale of the Dexter Horton Building should be reserved and used to pay a portion of the rent payable by City departments that will occupy that building after it is sold so that the net rent charged by the Executive Services Department to City tenants in the Dexter Horton Building will be the same, on a per square foot basis, as such department charges to City departments and offices for similar space in City- owned downtown buildings; NOW, THEREFORE,

 BE IT ORDAINED BY THE CITY OF SEATTLE AS FOLLOWS:

 Section 1. The real property located at 710 Second Avenue commonly known as the Dexter Horton Building and legally described as follows:

 Lots 5, 6, 7 and 8 in Block 6 of Town of Seattle, as laid out on the claims of C.D. Boren and A.A. Denny (commonly known as Boren & Denny's Addition to the City of Seattle), as per plat recorded in Volume 1 of Plats, page 27, records of King County;

 TOGETHER WITH that portion of the vacated alley in said block between and adjoining the northeasterly boundary lines of Lots 5 and 8, and the southwesterly boundary lines of Lots 6 and 7;

 EXCEPT the southwesterly 12 feet of said Lots 5 and 8 condemned for widening 2nd Avenue by the City of Seattle;

 AND EXCEPT the northeasterly 9 feet of said Lots 6 and 7 condemned for widening 3rd Avenue by the City of Seattle;

 Situate in the City of Seattle, County of King, State of Washington;

 is hereby declared to be surplus. The Executive Services Director is authorized to sell the described real property in accordance with a purchase and sale agreement as authorized in Section 2 below.~~~~

Section 2. The Executive Services Director is authorized to execute the Purchase and Sale Agreement, the First Amendment to Purchase and Sale Agreement, and the March 30, 2000 contingency period extension, all of which are attached hereto and collectively labeled "Attachment 1," except that the Executive Services Director (a) is authorized to further modify the amended Purchase and Sale Agreement shown in Attachment 1 prior to the closing of such building's sale as agreed with the buyer to modify time deadlines and to recognize the completion, prior to such closing, of certain phases of public works projects currently underway on that site, and (b) so long as the City's rights with respect to the gross sale price are not reduced or the City's financial liabilities increased, may agree, in his discretion, to minor modifications in other aspects of the agreement. The Executive Services Director is also authorized to execute such other documents as he reasonably determines are necessary to effectuate the sale of the Dexter Horton Building consistent with Section 1 and the remainder of this Section 2.

 Section 3. The Executive Services Director is authorized to execute, for and on behalf of The City of Seattle, a lease agreement with the buyer of the Dexter Horton Building substantially in the form of the lease attached hereto and labeled "Attachment 2" providing for occupancy by The City of Seattle of a portion of the real property identified in Section 1; and is further authorized to execute such minor amendments to such lease prior to the closing of the sale of the Dexter Horton Building as he reasonably determines to be necessary.

 Section 4. To the extent necessary to preserve the tax-exempt status of the outstanding City bond issues that have refinanced the Dexter Horton Building, namely, the City's Limited Tax General Obligation Refunding Bonds, 1992, and the combined issue of Unlimited Tax General Obligation Refunding Bonds, 1998, and Limited Tax General Obligation Refunding Bonds, 1998 (the "Outstanding Issues"), the Finance Director is hereby authorized to use and apply such portion of the gross proceeds of the sale authorized in Section 1 as the Finance Director determines is required ("disposition proceeds") to carry out a remedial action with respect to those bonds of the Outstanding Issues that become "nonqualified bonds" as a result of the sale of the Dexter Horton Building. Pending their application to a remedial action, those "disposition proceeds," presently estimated to be approximately Twenty Million Five Hundred Sixty Thousand Four Hundred Ninety-six Dollars ($20,560,496), or such other amount as the Finance Director determines is the correct amount, shall be deposited in a segregated subfund within the Municipal Civic Center Fund called the "Dexter Horton Building Disposition Proceeds Subfund." From this subfund, ten percent (10%) of the amount deposited pursuant to this section (but in no event greater than Two Million Five Hundred Thousand Dollars ($2,500,000)) is hereby appropriated for the implementation of the Municipal Civic Center Master Plan including but not limited to the activities authorized in Ordinance 119690.

 Section 5. Consistent with SMC 3.56.070.A, the difference between the sum of Two Hundred Fifty Thousand Dollars ($250,000), which is the fair market value of the site-specific public art work transferred with the Dexter Horton Building, and the share of the total costs incurred by the City in selling the Dexter Horton Building that is attributable to the sale of such art work, shall be deposited into the Municipal Art Fund (Fund 62600), City Light Account (VA 0000), which sum, but in no event greater than Two Hundred Fifty Thousand Dollars ($250,000), is hereby appropriated from the Municipal Art Fund to pay for the acquisition and exhibition of art as contemplated in SMC Ch. 20.32.

 Section 6. The remaining net proceeds from the sale authorized by Section 1, after the deduction and deposit of the amounts called for in Sections 4 and 5, shall be deposited into the Municipal Civic Center Fund. To pay the transaction costs related to the sale of the Dexter Horton Building including but not limited to the site-specific artwork located therein and the partial leaseback of such building, there is hereby appropriated from the Municipal Civic Center Fund (project number A12940) the sum of One Million One Hundred Thousand Dollars ($1,100,000), or so much thereof as may be necessary.

 Section 7. The City shall reserve Six Million Six Hundred Thirty- seven Thousand Three Hundred Seventy-four Dollars ($6,637,374) and investment earnings thereon in the Municipal Civic Center Fund for the purpose of paying a portion of the rent due under the lease agreement authorized in Section 3. This amount has been determined so that the net rent charged by the Executive Services Department to City tenants in the Dexter Horton Building will be the same on a per square foot basis as such department charges to City departments and offices for similar space in City-owned downtown buildings. The intent of this section is to ensure that City departments and offices remaining in the Dexter Horton Building do not bear the burden of additional rent as a result of the City's decision to sell that building.

 Section 8. In recognition that the Executive Services Operating Fund will no longer pay debt service on that portion of the Outstanding Issues attributable to the Dexter Horton Building, but the Executive Services Department will continue to charge City offices and departments as though the City had not sold the building and will, instead, apply those collected amounts to make rent payments to the buyer, the Municipal Civic Center Fund shall be used to pay that future debt service. Therefore, Seven Hundred Five Thousand Three Hundred Twenty-five Dollars ($705,325) is hereby appropriated from the Municipal Civic Center Fund (project number A12938) to make the September 1, 2000 interest payment on the Outstanding Issues attributable to the Dexter Horton Building.

 Section 9. Consistent with Section 7, Two Million Three Hundred Sixty-six Thousand Three Hundred Forty-two Dollars ($2,366,342) is hereby appropriated from the Municipal Civic Center Fund (Program Category A12939) to pay the increased cost in the year 2000 of office space under the lease authorized in Section 3.

 Section 10. The execution of contracts and agreements and other acts consistent with the authority and prior to the effective date of this ordinance are hereby ratified and confirmed.

 Section 11. The foregoing appropriations are made to meet actual necessary expenditures of the City for which no appropriation has been made due to causes that could not reasonably have been foreseen at the time of the making of the 2000 Budget; Now, Therefore, in accordance with RCW 35.32A.060, by reason of the facts above stated, this ordinance shall take effect and be in force thirty (30) days from and after its approval by the Mayor, but if not approved and returned by the Mayor within ten (10) days after presentation, it shall take effect as provided by Municipal Code Section 1.04.020.
