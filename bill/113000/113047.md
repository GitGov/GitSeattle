This segregation is intended to allow appropriate tracking of expenditures of bond proceeds and related investment earnings on bond proceeds. As appropriated in Sections 4 and 5 of this ordinance, these bond proceeds will be used for upgrades and replacement of the Fire Department's and the Police Department's wireless infrastructure (hereinafter referred to as "the Project"), and will be expended for the Project before all other money for the Project is used.
