 ORDINANCE ______

 AN ORDINANCE relating to the City Light Department; authorizing the Superintendent or his designee to enter into a ten-year power sales contract with the Bonneville Power Administration and a related creditworthiness agreement.

 WHEREAS, for many years, City Light has purchased power from the Bonneville Power Administration (BPA) to meet a portion of its electric load, currently under a 1981 power sales contract that will expire September 30, 2001, and BPA desires to enter into a new power sales contract with City Light by September 25, 2000 to provide electricity from October 1, 2001 through September 30, 2011; and

 WHEREAS, BPA plays a key role in the economy and environment of the Pacific Northwest by providing revenues from the sale of electricity at cost to pay the annual and capital expenses of the Federal Columbia River Power System, including substantial fish and wildlife restoration costs and debt service to the United States Treasury to repay the Federal government's investments in the system; and

 WHEREAS, City Light has requested up to 520 average megawatts of electricity from BPA for the new contract and that at least half of that amount be in the form of BPA's "Slice of the System" product which provides a percentage of BPA's actual annual power output in exchange for paying that percentage of BPA's actual annual costs, and that the remainder be in a Shaped Block sized to City Light's monthly net requirement; and

 WHEREAS, BPA will determine by September 1, 2000 the total amount of power it will sell to City Light and by September 27, 2000 the maximum amount of the "Slice of the System" product it will sell to City Light; and

 WHEREAS, BPA wants a related creditworthiness agreement with purchasers of the "Slice of the System" product to determine whether to require a letter of credit or other deposit for the Slice payments; and

 WHEREAS, the 36-resource Federal Slice System includes nearly 20,000 megawatts of installed capacity that has been producing energy for up to sixty years, currently about 7,000 average megawatts under critical conditions, and nearly 10,000 average megawatts under expected water. While the amount of power produced will vary with water conditions and non-power constraints like fish and wildlife recovery requirements, there is little likelihood that the system would ever not generate any electricity at all. In that unlikely event, the contract contains a provision to relieve a Slice purchaser from payment obligations in any month that BPA does not deliver power under this contract; and WHEREAS, City Light recommends continuing to purchase power from BPA both because it is expected to be less costly than other sources of power, and to support BPA's contributions to the region's economy and environmental objectives; and

 WHEREAS, budget authority and necessary staffing for this new agreement will be included in the Mayor's Proposed 2001-02 Budget; Now Therefore,

 BE IT ORDAINED BY THE CITY OF SEATTLE AS FOLLOWS: Section 1. The Superintendent of the City Light Department, or his designee, is hereby authorized to enter into a power sales agreement and related creditworthiness agreement with the Bonneville Power Administration substantially in the forms attached to this ordinance. The power sales agreement may include purchases of two BPA power products: the "Slice of the System" product, which is a percentage of the output of the Federal Columbia River Power System in return for paying that same percentage of BPA's actual costs of the system; and a Shaped Block of energy equal to the monthly difference between City Light's loads and the output of its own resources. At the time Seattle initially signs a contract with Bonneville for "slice" and "block" components of power delivery, Bonneville is not expected to have a final resolution of the amount of "Slice of System" it is able to offer. Accordingly, the Superintendent of City Light or his designee is hereby authorized to sign a final power purchase contract with Bonneville that in his view best meets the needs of City Light in balancing the slice and block components of the contract. Section 2. Any act taken in furtherance of this ordinance prior to its effective date is hereby ratified and confirmed. Section 3. This ordinance shall take effect and be in force thirty (30) days from and after its approval by the Mayor, but if not approved and returned by the Mayor within ten (10) days after presentation, it shall take effect as provided by Municipal Code Section 1.04.020. Passed by the City Council the _____ day of ____________, 2000, and signed by me in open session in authentication of its passage this _____ day of _________________, 2000.
