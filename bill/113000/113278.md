 ORDINANCE __________________

 AN ORDINANCE relating to Initiative 41 and the Elevated Transit Corporation's request for additional public funding, adopting certain legislative findings, responding to the writ of mandamus issued in Huber vs. City of Seattle, and repealing Initiative 41.

 WHEREAS, the electors of the City of Seattle approved Initiative 41 on November 4, 1997, creating a public corporation called the Elevated Transportation Company ("ETC"); and

 WHEREAS, Initiative 41 chartered the ETC with the principal purpose of implementing a plan to build, maintain, and operate a 40-mile electrically powered, rubber tired and principally elevated mass transportation system along specified routes and with the locations of many stations specified ("the Monorail system"); and

 WHEREAS, after the voters approved Initiative 41, the Seattle City Council passed and the Mayor signed Ordinance 118902, which provided $200,000 in initial funding for the ETC; through an agreement between the ETC and SEATRAN, such funding was intended to carry the ETC through its first year, with the hope that private investors would come forward to advance the Monorail system plan described in Initiative 41, and that the balance of unexpended funds has twice been carried over by the Council and Mayor for the ETC's continued use; and

 WHEREAS, Initiative 41, which included no specific funding mechanism, did not legally obligate the City Council to fund the Monorail system plan described in the initiative, and did not and could not have required the City to issue Councilmanic bonds, or to raise the City's Business and Occupations tax, instead generally provided that the ETC should attempt to locate private funding to carry out its goal of building the Monorail system described in the initiative; however, the ETC has been unable, to date, to locate any significant private funding to advance the Monorail system proposed in Initiative 41 or even to pay ETC's organizational costs or fund preliminary studies; and

 WHEREAS, Initiative 41 stated that the ETC could, after seeking private funding, seek public funds from the City to be provided by the issuance of an unspecified amount of Councilmanic revenue bonds or by an unspecified increase in the City's Business and Occupations tax:

 "To this purpose, the City Council of Seattle shall make funds available to the PDA either by issuing Councilmanic Revenue bonds or raising the City's Business and Occupations tax." (Initiative 41, Article IV); and

 WHEREAS, the ETC has served as a partner in the Seattle Transit Initiative (STI) since STI's inception in 1998, along with the City of Seattle, King County Metro, Sound Transit, the Washington State Department of Transportation; and a product of the STI will be an "intermediate capacity transit" study that will examine the feasibility of new transit services along several corridors throughout the city and across a broad range of technologies -- technologies that range from enhanced bus operations to exclusive guideway systems such as monorails; and

 WHEREAS, on June 7, 2000, a ruling from King County Superior Court in Case No. 00-2-11207-6SEA directed that the City should exercise its discretion to either provide or propose to the electors additional funding for continued operation of the ETC toward their purpose of building and operating a Monorail system within the City, or amend or repeal the initiative; and

 WHEREAS, because it has been over two years since Initiative 41 took effect, the City Council now has the authority, affirmed by the King County Superior Court in Case No. 00-2-11207-6SEA, to amend or repeal the initiative by a simple majority vote;

 NOW THEREFORE, BE IT ORDAINED BY THE CITY OF SEATTLE, THE MAYOR CONCURRING:

 Section 1. City Goals.

 Providing for transportation improvements is an important public and municipal purpose.

 The public mass transportation system in Seattle and the Puget Sound Region is in need of major improvements. In particular, intermediate-capacity transit currently provided by Metro Transit is inadequate to meet the needs of Seattle citizens.

 The City Council affirms the underlying purposes of Initiative 41:

 (a) to provide cross-town intermediate-capacity transit linking Seattle neighborhoods and connecting with Sound Transit;

 (b) to consider monorail technology --- elevated, rubber-tired, electrical, on exclusive guideways --- as one of the transit options.

 The Council directs the Executive to continue to include monorail technologies in the options under consideration by the Seattle Transit Initiative. The City has contracted with Parsons Brinkerhoff for a study of Seattle's intermediate capacity transit needs and options, and anticipates completion in November 2000. The Executive is directed to report to the Council by December 1, 2000 on the results of the Seattle Transit Initiative study and proposed implementation.

 Section 2. Findings: Initiative 41 Funding Infeasible.

 The City Council makes the following findings concerning the various methods for financing the Monorail system described in Initiative 41.

 (a) System-wide costs for the 40-mile Monorail system described in Initiative 41 are in the following range:

 $1.4 - $2.0 billion capital costs, excluding right-of- way acquisition

 $61 - 86 million annual operating/maintenance costs, which could be partially offset by fares or other subsidies.

 These cost ranges are derived from information presented at the August 1998 Charrette conducted by ETC.

 (b) Private sector financing of the Monorail system is deemed impractical. The ETC sought funding through a Request for Expression of Interest issued March 6, 1999, and a Request for Partners issued October 1999. After two years of study and these efforts, the ETC narrowed the scope of its efforts to secure private funding from the full 40-mile neighborhood-serving "X" system described in Initiative 41 to a downtown circulator.

 (c) Funding through Councilmanic revenue bonds, as proposed in Initiative 41, is infeasible. The lack of interest by private investors in financing the Monorail demonstrates that revenue bonds would be unmarketable unless guaranteed by the City. The remaining Councilmanic debt capacity is $137 million, far short of the $1.4 billion needed to build the system.

 (d) Funding through Business and Occupation (B&O) tax increases, as proposed in Initiative 41, is infeasible. Seattle B&O tax rates are already among the highest in the state, implicating the City's competitive advantage as a place to do business. Doubling the B&O tax would raise approximately $100 million a year, and could fund build-out of the system over 14 to 20 years. However, a B&O tax increase could not be used to support debt service on Councilmanic bonds without violating debt capacity limits.

 (e) Funding through voter-approved bonds, which goes beyond the funding proposed by Initiative 41, is indefensible. The City's remaining legal debt capacity for voted bonds is $432 million of which $96 million is committed to Libraries for All, far short of the $1.4 billion needed for Monorail system build-out.

 Section 3. Findings: Initiative 41 Administrative Structure Impractical

 Initiative 41 chartered the Elevated Transportation Company to build and operate a 40-mile monorail system in Seattle. The City Council finds that creation and operation of an intermediate capacity transit system, particularly one with high up-front capital costs, necessitates governmental powers, legislative authority, and funding sources beyond those available to a PDA. Through the Seattle Transit Initiative, the City will seek targeted improvements in the transit systems and services for which Sound Transit and Metro Transit are chartered and funded. The Seattle Transit Initiative will also assess and make recommendations on the feasibility of Seattle funding and operating its own transit system or portion thereof.

 Section 4. Findings: Ballot Measure Impractical

 The City Council finds as follows:

 (a) The cost of putting a proposition on the September 2000 primary election ballot is approximately $500,000.

 (b) An Evans/McDonough poll of Seattle voters on March 28, 2000 indicated that only 36% approved or were likely to approve a twenty-year, one hundred million dollar ($100,000,000) bond to begin extension of the monorail, while 52% rejected or were likely to reject the measure. Even a one-time, $2 million levy to fund a feasibility study failed to win approval (44% favorable, 48% unfavorable).

 The City Council concludes that it would be a waste of public funds to present a ballot issue to Seattle voters with the expectation or intent that it be voted down.

 Section 5. Repeal

 Initiative 41 is hereby repealed, and the ETC is directed to conclude its current phase of operations and issue a report which summarizes its activities and accomplishments to date. The City Council will provide a limited amount of funding for the report and other close-out activities.
