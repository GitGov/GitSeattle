 AN ORDINANCE relating to land use and zoning, repealing the moratorium adopted by Ordinance 119487 as amended, amending Seattle Municipal Code Sections 23.55.003, 23.55.030, 23.55.034, 23.55.036, 23.55.040, 23.66.160, 23.66.338, 23.69.021, 23.84.036 and adding a new section 23.55.005, Video Display Methods, to regulate use of video display on signs.

 WHEREAS, among the purposes of the Sign Code are to allow signs that invite rather than demand the public's attention, to encourage the use of signs that enhance the visual environment of the city, and to protect the public interest and safety;

 WHEREAS, the City of Seattle regulates signs and displays on signs in order to reduce potential traffic safety hazards and visual blight, among other reasons set out in SMC 23.55.001;

 WHEREAS, for these reasons the City prohibits or otherwise regulates signs that flash, or that rotate or have moving parts that rotate rapidly;

 WHEREAS, a major study on electronic signs prepared by the Federal Highway Administration found that "motion or the illusion of motion of lights or other display features," including animation, has "the greatest potential for motorist distraction as well as a dominant visual impact on the aesthetic environment."
