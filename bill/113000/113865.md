 AN ORDINANCE related to the Legislative Department, establishing a procedure for regularly revising the salaries of Councilmembers.

 WHEREAS, a more consistent and equitable procedure for setting and updating Councilmember's salaries needs to be established;

 NOW THEREFORE, BE IT ORDAINED BY THE CITY OF SEATTLE AS FOLLOWS:

 Section 1. Consistent with Article XI, Section 8 of the Washington State Constitution and Article XV11, Section 1 of the Seattle City Charter, the salary for the title 'Councilmember' will be revised by the Legislative Department in each odd-numbered year beginning in 2001 according to the following procedure:

 Step 1) Based on consumer price index projections provided by independent, third-party sources, the Legislative Department will develop estimates of the annual cost-of-living adjustments needed to preserve the effective purchasing power of current Councilmember salaries over the next four years.

 Step 2) These estimates of the annual cost-of-living adjustments will then be applied to the existing salary for the title 'Councilmember' to develop estimates of the corresponding annual salary levels for each year of the same four-year period.

 Step 3) The salary for the title "Councilmember" will then be calculated as the average of the salary levels computed for each of these four years.

 Section 2. The Legislative Department shall, no later than October 31, communicate the salary determined in Step 3 to the City Budget Office and human resource/payroll system for implementation and inclusion in the Legislative Department's proposed budget. At the same time, each Councilmember will be provided a written summary of the results of the salary adjustment procedure described here. As appropriate, this summary will include recommendations about how the existing salary for the title "Councilmember" could be revised to reflect actual inflation patterns since the last salary adjustment and how such adjustments would affect the salary revision developed under the three steps outlined above. The resulting salary adjustments will be adopted as part of the City budget and will take effect January 1 of the next year. Consistent with Article XI, Section 8 of the Washington State Constitution and Article XV11, Section 1 of the Seattle City Charter, the salary associated with a particular Council position shall not be adjusted until a new term of office begins for that Council position.

 Section 3. Upon implementation of this procedure, Councilmember salaries will no longer be eligible for any cost-of-living adjustments that may be provided to non-represented employees.

 Section 4. This ordinance shall take effect and be in force thirty (30) days from and after its approval by the Mayor, but if not approved and returned by the Mayor within ten (10) days after presentation, it shall take effect as provided by Municipal Code Section 1.04.020 effective date

 Passed by the City Council the _____ day of _______________, 2001, and signed by me in open session in authentication of its passage this _____ day of _______________, 2001. ___________________________________ President of the City Council
