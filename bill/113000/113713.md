 ORDINANCE __________

 AN ORDINANCE relating to Emergency Medical Services; authorizing execution, pursuant to the Interlocal Cooperation Act, of an agreement with King County regarding the imposition and allocation of property tax revenues generated by a six-year, voter-approved King County-wide tax levy for emergency medical services, and approving the submittal by King County of a proposition to the voters seeking authority to levy those additional taxes.

 WHEREAS, King County desires to place before the qualified electors of King County a ballot proposition authorizing the County to levy additional regular property taxes in amounts up to twenty-five cents per thousand dollars of assessed valuation each year, for exactly six consecutive years, on all taxable property within King County for the support of emergency medical services ("EMS"), pursuant to the powers granted to it in RCW 84.52.069; and

 WHEREAS, RCW 84.52.069 does not permit a County-wide regular tax levy for emergency medical services to be placed on the ballot until after the legislative authority of every city having a population in excess of fifty thousand within such county has approved such action; and

 WHEREAS, State law allows King County to place on the ballot a proposition to authorize tax levies at less than the maximum tax rate as allowed by law to provide for emergency medical services, thereby allowing the City to impose, with its voters' approval, its own EMS tax levy, if it so desires; and

 WHEREAS, King County proposes to carry out its obligation to provide emergency medical services on a County-wide basis by, among other actions, making funds available for expenses incurred in the City's independent emergency medical services program through the allocating and transferring to the City of that portion of the tax revenues generated by the County EMS tax levy that is attributable to taxable property within the City, with certain minimum amounts established; NOW, THEREFORE,

 BE IT ORDAINED BY THE CITY OF SEATTLE AS FOLLOWS:

 Section 1. The placing before the qualified electors of King County, pursuant to the powers granted to King County by RCW 84.52.069, of a ballot proposition on November 6, 2001, authorizing the County to levy each year for exactly six (6) consecutive years commencing in 2001 (for collection beginning in 2002) additional regular property taxes County-wide in amounts up to twenty-five cents ($0.25) per thousand dollars of assessed valuation on all taxable property within King County, for the support of emergency medical services ("EMS"), is hereby approved, conditioned upon the execution by King County, prior to placement of the measure on the ballot, of the interlocal agreement authorized by Section 2, and subject to the terms of that agreement.

 Section 2. The Mayor is hereby authorized to execute, for and on behalf of The City of Seattle, an agreement with King County substantially in the form of the attached Exhibit A, "Interlocal Cooperation Agreement for Allocation of Property Tax Revenues between The City of Seattle and King County;" no deviation from the form of agreement shown in Exhibit A may reduce the City's right to receive the minimum amounts shown in Paragraph 2 of Exhibit A.

 Section 4. This ordinance shall take effect and be in force the later of:

 INTERLOCAL COOPERATION AGREEMENT

 FOR ALLOCATION OF PROPERTY TAX REVENUES

 BETWEEN THE CITY OF SEATTLE

 AND

 KING COUNTY

 (2001 - 2007)

 THIS AGREEMENT is entered into pursuant to the "Interlocal Cooperation Act," codified as Ch. 39.34 RCW, by and between The City of Seattle ("The City") and King County ("The County"); WITNESSETH:

 WHEREAS, the County desires to place before the qualified electors of King County a ballot proposition authorizing the County to levy additional regular property taxes County-wide in amounts up to 25 cents per thousand dollars of assessed valuation each year for six consecutive years on all taxable property within King County for the support of emergency medical services ("EMS") pursuant to the powers granted to it in RCW 84.52.069; and

 WHEREAS, the City operates and funds an emergency medical services program which is independent from the County's program; and

 WHEREAS, a portion of the revenues to be collected pursuant to the County-wide EMS levy will be attributable to taxable property located within the legal boundaries of the City; and

 WHEREAS, the parties hereto desire to reimburse and transfer to the City for the support of its emergency medical services program all revenues to be collected pursuant to the County-wide EMS levy from the taxable property located within the legal boundaries of the City of Seattle; and

 WHEREAS, the County has determined that the reimbursement and transfer agreement set forth below will not affect the County's ability to provide emergency medical service throughout the County; and

 WHEREAS, RCW 84.52.069 provides that no County-wide EMS levy proposal may be placed on the ballot without approval of the legislative authority of the City;

 Now, Therefore, the parties agree as follows:

 1. The County shall submit to the qualified electors of King County at a general election to be held on November 6, 2001, a proposition authorizing the County to levy additional regular property taxes each year for exactly six consecutive years beginning in 2001 for collection beginning in 2002 on taxable property within the County in amounts up to twenty-five (25) cents per thousand dollars of assessed valuation pursuant to RCW 84.52.069 for expenses incurred in the provision of emergency medical services.

 2. This Agreement shall commence upon its signing by both parties. Upon the approval by the qualified electors of King County of the authority for additional regular property tax levies as set forth in RCW 84.52.069, the King County Council shall by ordinance each year impose said levy at a rate that is at least the lowest of (a) the rate of twenty-five (25) cents per thousand dollars of assessed valuation; (b) the rate that, when applied to the assessed valuation in Seattle that year, would yield the amount identified for the corresponding tax collection year as the "EMS Levy Projected Assessments: Seattle" set forth in the "Forecasted Assessed Value and Levy Assessment for 2002-2007" table on page 46 of the "2002 Strategic Plan Update of the 1998-2003 Emergency Medical Services Strategic Plan" attached to King County Proposed Substitute Motion No. 2001-0236.2; or (c) the highest rate lawful under state law. The County shall levy said voter-approved regular property tax beginning in 2001, and each year thereafter for a total of six consecutive years. This Agreement shall terminate on the later of December 31, 2007, or when all property taxes levied by King County under this Agreement have been collected and the proper share transferred to the City.

 3. The County shall transfer to the City all revenues collected pursuant to the County-wide EMS levy from taxable property located within the legal boundaries of the City at the levy rate authorized herein. The County shall not by ordinance or by public vote or otherwise impose any constraints on the City's use of the revenues from the County-wide EMS levy beyond those imposed by State law or by Paragraph 5 of this Agreement.

 4. Transfer of the revenues set forth in Paragraph 3 above shall be administered by the King County Office of Finance in the manner and at such times as the County transfers revenues produced pursuant to levies listed in or authorized by RCW 84.52.043.

 5. All revenues received pursuant to the County-wide EMS levy and this Agreement shall be used only for the provision of emergency medical services as specified in RCW 84.52.069 (3), and shall be deposited into a special revenue account established by the City for that purpose.

 6. In return for the County's agreement to impose taxes and transfer tax proceeds as set forth in Paragraphs 2 and 3 above, the City gives its approval by ordinance for the submission to the qualified electors of King County of the County-wide multi-year additional property tax levy proposition for emergency medical services described in Section 1 above.

 7. Nothing in this Agreement shall be deemed to prohibit the City from levying an annual tax levy pursuant to RCW 84.52.052 or a levy pursuant to RCW 84.52.069 to fund emergency medical services.

 8. The parties hereto expressly reserve for themselves the right to amend this Agreement. No amendment hereto will be effective unless it is in writing and signed by the authorized representatives of the parties hereto.
