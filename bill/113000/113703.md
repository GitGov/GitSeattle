 WHEREAS, the City Light Department has been granted authority by Ordinance 113633 to enter into any longer term power purchase contracts to assist it in managing the power crisis; and

 WHEREAS, prudent management of its power portfolio in the face of market uncertainty also requires it to have the authority to enter into longer terms sales agreements; Now Therefore,

 Section 1. Seattle Municipal Code Section 21.49.130 is hereby amended to read as follows:

 21.49.130 Authority.

 A. The Department shall have the authority to interpret the provisions of this chapter where necessary to implement and enforce its terms and provisions, provided, however, such interpretation shall be consistent with the intent of the City Council in setting the rates and terms and conditions for the use of the electric service provided under this chapter and shall not expand the scope and authority contained therein.

 B. Rule-making and Contract Authority.

 1. The Department shall have authority to adopt and file as appropriate rules, regulations, policies, and procedures relating to its performance of the provisions of this chapter and to the operation of the Department's light and power system. The Department may require compliance with such rules, regulations, policies and procedures as a condition for the supply or continued supply of electric service.

 2. Upon determining availability or necessity for purchase, or a short-term surplus of nonfirm energy, the Department may enter into contracts with any city or town, public utility district, governmental agency, municipal corporation, mutual association, broker, agent, or with any person, firm, or corporation, or any other member of the general public, outside its service area, terminable on not more than eighteen (18) months' notice, providing for the acquisition, exchange or sale of energy on terms most favorable to the Department under such circumstances and in compliance with state law, including RCW 43.09.210. Such sale or exchange shall be made on a basis representing the value of such energy under existing market conditions.

 3. The Department may enter into or amend agreements with the Bonneville Power Administration providing for reimbursements from Bonneville of some or all of the costs of operating energy conservation programs authorized by the City Council. The Department shall determine that such agreements or amendments to such agreements shall not incur any indebtedness or the acceptance of moneys imposing any duties or obligations on the City which are inconsistent with the Department's budget appropriation for such energy conservation programs. The Department shall provide a written notification prior to the execution of such contracts and a copy of such contracts to the appropriate authorizing committee of the City Council.

 4. In addition to the authority provided in subsection B.2 above, the Department, upon approval of each such contract by Council resolution, also shall have the authority through April 1, 2002, to enter into longer-term power { + sales, + } purchase or exchange contracts with any city or town, public utility district, governmental agency, municipal corporation, mutual association, broker, agent, or with any person, firm, or corporation, or any other member of the general public, either inside or outside its service area. Each such contract shall have a term of not more than seven years. The combined total of all long-term contracts entered into by the Department pursuant to the authority of this subsection may not exceed an average of 100 MW at any one time.

 C. Contracts and Authorized Agents. The Department may also enter into contracts of a general nature relating to the utility system. No promise, agreement, or representation of any employee or agent of the Department with reference to furnishing electricity shall be binding on the Department unless it is embodied in writing and signed by a duly authorized agent of the Department in accordance with the provisions of this chapter.

 D. Authority to Interrupt Service. The Department shall have the authority to restrict the use of loads and/or services during scheduled maintenance outages and during periods of emergency when the Department determines that the continued use of the loads would jeopardize the Department's generation, transmission, or distribution system.

 E. Special Service Charges and Interest Charges. The Department may add service charges or may separately bill customers to recover certain administrative, investigative and collection expenses in addition to any civil fine or forfeiture imposed under Section 21.49.140. These may include but are not limited to dishonored checks; field calls on delinquent accounts; service disconnections and reconnections resulting from City ordinance violations or failure to pay; and field calls, lab tests and office work involved in detecting, reporting, investigating and correcting cases of current diversion. The Department may also add interest charges on delinquent customer accounts and for other services including, but not limited to, C-bills and bills for damage. The Department may develop a standard per month charge for accounts that are too small to economically calculate interest. Such interest charges or standard charges may be added to the bill for each month or part thereof that the bill is delinquent. The Department shall have authority to bill for interest charges applied to the value of diverted current or unbilled service used during a billing period or periods, with interest charges beginning to run on the established due date for each billing period during which current was diverted or unbilled. Interest charged is to be at the statutory nominal percentage rate, compounded monthly.

 F. Recovery of Service Disconnection Costs. The Department shall have the authority to establish and collect service disconnection charges based on cost when such charges are adopted pursuant to and in accordance with the provisions of the Administrative Code (Seattle Municipal Code Chapter 3.02, Ordinance 102228, as amended). If service is disconnected for any violation of the provisions of this chapter, a service disconnection charge shall be added to the account. If service is disconnected at the request of a customer or property owner, a service disconnection charge shall be billed to the customer or property owner making the request, unless the service is disconnected when the purpose is to maintain service entrance equipment or enhance its safety. If service is disconnected for failure to pay bills when due, the service shall not be restored until payment in full has been received by the Department, or satisfactory arrangements have been made for payment of all charges. Reconnection cannot be assured on the same day payment is made.

 G. Equipment Rental. The Department shall have authority to sell, rent, lease, construct, install, operate, and/or service material, supplies, facilities, appliances, or equipment for the use or conservation of electricity. The Department may also establish and collect charges based on cost, conservation, and/or the use of electricity and enter into related agreements. Any agreements entered into or charges made prior to the effective date of the ordinance codified in this chapter are ratified and confirmed.

 Section 2. Any act taken in furtherance of this ordinance prior to its effective date is hereby ratified and confirmed.

 Section 3. This ordinance shall take effect and be in force thirty (30) days from and after its approval by the Mayor, but if not approved and returned by the Mayor within ten (10) days after presentation, it shall take effect as provided by Municipal Code Section 1.04.020.
