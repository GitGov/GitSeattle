 AN ORDINANCE relating to the Seattle Department of Parks and Recreation; authorizing grant agreements with the State of Washington Interagency Committee for Outdoor Recreation for financial assistance to help develop the Lower Woodland, Judkins, and Riverview Ballfield Projects; increasing the expenditure authority in the Department's 2000 budget; and making a reimbursable appropriation from the Cumulative Reserve Subfund, all by three-fourths vote of the City Council.

 WHEREAS, the Department has recognized that there is a great demand for more sports fields and field use for athletic play and that most of our current fields are at capacity use or already overused; and

 WHEREAS, in order to meet rising demands for fields and field use, the Department must look at fields that are underused due to limited scheduling because of factors such as poor surface conditions caused by aging irrigation and drainage systems, insufficient or inadequate field maintenance resources, lack of lighting, etc.; and

 WHEREAS, the Department desires to make improvements to under-used fields to increase capacity use and seek funding in order to implement these improvements; and

 WHEREAS, in 1999, the Interagency Committee for Outdoor Recreation's Youth Athletic Fields Grant Program provided funding to support development and acquisition of athletic fields statewide; and

 WHEREAS, the Department identified and applied to the IAC for grants for three Projects--the Lower Woodland, Judkins, and Riverview ballfield Projects as viable candidates to increase field use; and

 WHEREAS, the Department was notified by the IAC that it had successfully competed for and secured funding in the total amounts of $427,883 for the three projects noted above; and
