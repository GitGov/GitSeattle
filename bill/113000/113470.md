 AN ORDINANCE relating to the evaluation of Seattle's vehicle impound program; authorizing the execution of an agreement with the Washington Traffic Safety Commission for financial assistance in the amount of One Hundred Twelve Thousand Dollars ($112,000) to evaluate the deterrent effects of impounding vehicles driven by persons arrested for driving while license suspended; increasing the 2000 Budget of the Legislative Department by making a reimbursable appropriation; and ratifying and confirming prior acts; all by a three-fourths vote of the City Council.

 WHEREAS in 1998 the City Council passed Ordinance 119180 allowing the impoundment of vehicles driven by persons arrested for driving while license suspended or revoked (DWLS) in the first, second, or third degree; and

 WHEREAS one main reason for impounding vehicles driven by persons arrested for DWLS is to improve traffic safety by deterring unsafe driving; and

 WHEREAS, although there is substantial evidence from evaluations of similar programs in California, Ohio, and Oregon that impounding vehicles driven by persons arrested for DWLS has a specific deterrent effect and reduces subsequent traffic offenses and crashes, a scientific evaluation of the deterrent effects of Seattle's program may contribute to its refinement and to the City's and public's understanding of the program; and

 WHEREAS the Washington Traffic Safety Commission grants financial support to programs and strategies to reduce the number of deaths and serious injuries that result from traffic crashes, and to this end has awarded Seattle a grant to evaluate the deterrent effects of its vehicle impound program; NOW THEREFORE

 BE IT ORDAINED BY THE CITY OF SEATTLE AS FOLLOWS:

 Section 1. The Director of the Legislative Department Central Staff is authorized to execute for and on behalf of the City of Seattle an agreement with the Washington Traffic Safety Commission for financial assistance in the amount of One Hundred Twelve Thousand Dollars ($112,000) to evaluate the deterrent effects of impounding vehicles driven by persons arrested for driving while license suspended. The funds, when received, are hereby accepted, and shall be deposited to the credit of the Supplemental Appropriation Account of the Emergency Subfund to reimburse for the appropriation made in Section 2.

 Section 2. To carry out the purpose of the grant agreement authorized in Section 1, and contingent on the execution of that agreement, the following program category in the 2000 budget of the Legislative Department is increased as follows:

 Legislative Department

 G1100 - Legislative $112,000

 by the appropriation hereby made and authorized of One Hundred Twelve Thousand Dollars ($112,000) from the Supplemental Appropriation Account of the Emergency Subfund to be reimbursed from funds to be received from the Washington Traffic Safety Commission as authorized in Section 1. The appropriations of funds in this ordinance shall carry forward from year to year unless expressly abandoned by ordinance.

 Section 3. To carry out the purpose of the grant agreement authorized in Section 1, the Director of the Legislative Department Central Staff is authorized to enter into one or more consultant contracts within the expenditure authority granted in Section 2, and consistent with applicable federal, state, and City laws.

 Section 4. Any act consistent with the authority but prior to the effective date of this ordinance is hereby ratified and confirmed.

 Section 5. The foregoing appropriation is made to meet actual necessary expenditures of the City for which no appropriation has been made due to causes which could not reasonably have been foreseen at the time of the making of the 2000 Budget; now, therefore, in accordance with RCW 35.32A.060 by reason of the facts stated above, this ordinance shall take effect and be in force thirty (30) days from and after its approval by the Mayor, but if not approved and returned by the Mayor within ten (10) days after presentation, it shall take effect as provided by Municipal Code 1.04.020.
