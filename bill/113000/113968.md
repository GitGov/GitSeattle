 1. Threshold Conditions. Subject to subsection B2 of this section, properties that may be considered for an L3 designation are limited to the following:

 a. Properties already zoned L3;

 b. Properties in areas already developed predominantly to the permitted L3 density and where L3 scale is well established; ~~or~~

 c. Properties within an urban center or village, except as provided in this subsection below, where less emphasis shall be placed on density and scale compatibility with existing development, when the designation will be consistent with the densities required for the center or village category as established in Section B of the Land Use Element of the Comprehensive Plan, unless otherwise indicated by a neighborhood plan adopted or amended by the City Council after January 1, 1995. This subsection B1c shall not apply in the Wallingford Residential Urban Village, in the Eastlake Residential Urban Village, in the Upper Queen Anne Residential Urban Village, in the Morgan Junction Residential Urban Village, in the Lake City Hub Urban Village, in the Bitter Lake Village Hub Urban Village, or in the Admiral Residential Urban Village~~.~~, or  d.

 2. Properties designated as environmentally critical may not be rezoned to an L3 designation, and may remain L3 only in areas predominantly developed to the intensity of the L3 zone.

 3. Other Criteria. The Lowrise 3 zone designation is most appropriate in areas generally characterized by the following:

 a. Development Characteristics of the Area.

 (1) Either:

 (a) Areas that are already developed predominantly to the permitted L3 density and where L3 scale is well established, ~~or~~

 (b) Areas that are within an urban center or urban village, except as provided in this subsection below, where less emphasis shall be placed on density and scale compatibility with existing development, when the designation will be consistent with the densities required for the center or village category as established in Section B of the Land Use Element of the Comprehensive Plan, unless otherwise indicated by a neighborhood plan adopted or amended by the City Council after January 1, 1995.

 (3) Properties in areas with existing multifamily zoning with close proximity and pedestrian connections to neighborhood services, public open spaces, schools and other residential amenities;

 (3) Properties with close proximity and with good pedestrian connections to services in neighborhood commercial areas, public open spaces and other residential amenities;

 (4) Properties with well-defined edges providing sufficient separation from adjacent areas of small scale residential development, or where such areas are separated by zones providing a transition in the height, scale and density of development.
