 AN ORDINANCE relating to land use and zoning, amending Ordinance 119838 by extending the date of the expiration of the Station Area Interim Overlay District, Chapter 23.70 of the Seattle Municipal Code, until March 1, 2001.

 BE IT ORDAINED BY THE CITY OF SEATTLE AS FOLLOWS:

 Section 1. The City Council hereby makes the following legislative findings of fact:

 a) On March 3, 1999, Ordinance 119394 was passed to establish the Station Area Interim Overlay District. The District established interim regulations applicable within approximately 1/4 mile of proposed light rail stations. Within the District, certain uses incompatible with transit-oriented development are prohibited and revised parking and access standards for uses in Commercial 1/ Commercial 2 zones are established.

 b) On January 18, 2000, Ordinance 119838 was passed to extend the duration of the Station Area Interim Overlay District to September 1, 2000.

 c) By adopting and extending the Interim Overlay District, the City Council ensured that the City's station area planning process could proceed without vesting of rights to establish uses incompatible with the City's station area planning goals.

 d) In spring 2000, the City Council recommended, and the Sound Transit Board decided, not to provide now for a possible future light rail station on Martin Luther King, Jr. Way S. at S. Graham Street. Following this action, the City Council passed Ordinance 119986 on June 19, 2000, deleting the Station Area Interim Overlay District as it applied to the formerly-proposed S. Graham Street light rail station.

 e) Ordinance 119838 is scheduled to expire on September 1, 2000.

 f) In order to allow station area planning to be completed, the City Council finds it necessary to extend the duration of the Interim Overlay District for an additional six months. The Council therefore finds that the protection of the public health, safety, and welfare requires extending the overlay district through March 1, 2001.

 Section 2. Section 2 of Ordinance 119838 is hereby amended to read:

 This Ordinance expires ~~September 1, 2000~~March 1, 2001.

 Section 3. This ordinance shall take effect and be in force thirty (30) days from and after its approval by the Mayor, but if not approved and returned by the Mayor within ten (10) days after presentation, it shall take effect as provided by Municipal Code Section 1.04.020.
