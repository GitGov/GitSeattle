 THIS EASEMENT AGREEMENT is made and entered into this _______ day of _______________, 2001, by the Port of Seattle, a municipal corporation of the State of Washington, Grantor(s), hereinafter the "Port" or "Grantor", and The City of Seattle, a municipal corporation of the State of Washington, hereinafter called the "City" or "Grantee".

 For and in consideration of the sum of FIVE HUNDRED AND NO/100THS DOLLARS ($500.00), receipt of which is hereby acknowledged, and the covenants and promises of the City and the Port hereinafter set forth, the Port hereby grants, convey(s) and warrant(s) to said City:

 A non-exclusive easement for a monitoring well,

 Said easement being for the purpose of installing, operating, maintaining, repairing, and monitoring a monitoring well and data recorder ("well"), together with the right of ingress to and egress from the premises for the foregoing purposes, including gating, subject to the conditions and limitations stated herein. This easement shall be effective on the date executed by the Port, over, under, through, across and upon the following described property:

 The south 10 feet of the northeast one-quarter of the southwest one-quarter of the southwest one-quarter of Section 16, Township 23 North, Range 4 East. W.M. EXCEPT the west 150 feet thereof, AND EXCEPT portion within County Road.

 Situate in the City of SeaTac, County of King, State of Washington.

 The Port and City covenant as follows:

 1. The City shall not disturb the Port-owned real property other than to the extent that such disturbances are necessary for the activities permitted in this easement. The City shall, at its cost, restore the Port-owned real property which is disturbed to its pre-existing condition (except as specified herein) in a timely fashion, including but not limited to, removal of all debris from Port property. All existing improvements and personal property on said real property damaged by the City's activities shall, at the City's cost, be repaired or replaced at the Port's option.

 2. No part of the well may penetrate the atmosphere more than 3 feet above the existing ground level without the prior written approval of the Managing Director, Aviation Division of the Port. A locking steel casing approximately 36 inches in diameter standing 3 feet above ground will serve to protect the well and house the data collection and sampling equipment.

 3. The premises and surrounding property are leased to various Port tenants (hereafter "Tenants"). The City shall therefore provide 24 hours written notice to the Port's Managing Director, Aviation Division for all activities described herein, except for routine, periodic monitoring and maintenance of the well during normal working hours. The City agrees to ensure that existing Tenants shall have reasonable access to and from their leased properties to such an extent that such Tenants will be able to carry out their normal business activities. Leases or other instruments of tenancy entered into subsequent to the effective date herein shall be made subject to this easement.

 4. The Port shall not be responsible for any injury, loss or damage of any kind or description, which may accrue to or be sustained by any person (including persons directly or indirectly employed by the City, its contractors or agents), firm, corporation or other entity by reason of the use and occupancy of the easement area by the City, its successors or assigns. In the event any suit or action be brought against the Port by reason thereof, the City, its successors or assigns shall indemnify and save the Port harmless therefrom, and shall upon notice to it of the commencement thereof, defend such suit or action at its sole cost and expense and will fully satisfy the final judgement rendered in any such suit or action except for that portion, if any, of such injury, loss or damage that results in such judgement, which is attributable to and proximately results from negligence of the Port, its agents, employees or officers.

 5. All right, title and interest which may be used and enjoyed without unreasonably interfering with the easement rights herein granted are reserved to the Port. The Port, its successors and assigns shall have the right to use said property in any way not inconsistent with the rights herein granted to the City. The Port shall have the right to construct, erect or otherwise install buildings and/or structures and improvements within the premises.

 6. In the event that any portion of the premises is required by the Port for a major Port improvement, or if any building, structure or improvement shall unreasonably interfere with the easement rights herein granted, the Port retains the right to begin relocation of any or all portions of the well at its expense on at least 180 days prior written notice to the City. Such relocation to a mutually agreeable location shall be accomplished according to plans and with materials approved by the Managing Director of Seattle Public Utilities. The Port shall grant to the City a non-exclusive easement for the relocated well. The terms of said easement shall be substantially the same as the terms contained herein.

 7. The City shall be liable for, and shall pay throughout the duration of this easement, all license and excise fees and occupation taxes covering its activities conducted on the premises, and all taxes on City property on the premises and any taxes on the interest created by this easement.

 8. The City shall keep the premises free and clear of any liens and encumbrances arising out of its activities relating to this easement.

 9. The City shall comply with all applicable Port rules and regulations pertaining to the safe use of the premises and surrounding properties. The City shall further comply with all applicable federal, State and local laws, ordinances, and regulations.

 10. In the event the City abandons the well on the premises or otherwise terminates its utilization, this easement shall terminate.

 11. The City shall not assign or transfer this easement or any interest therein without the express written consent from the Port's Executive Director. The burdens, benefits, and conditions described herein shall run with the land and be binding upon and enforceable against all successors in right, title, or interest.

 12. In the event the City breaches or fails to comply with the conditions described herein, and fails to cure such breach within 90 days of receipt of written notice from the Port, the Port may, at its option, terminate this easement without penalty.
