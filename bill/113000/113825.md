The agreement may include such additional terms and conditions as the City Attorney or the Director of Finance determines are appropriate to serve the best interests of the City.

 C. In addition to the payments covering wage losses, the City Attorney or the Director of Finance may, prior to settlement of the claimant's claim or prior to judgment, pay medical costs and provide necessary transportation and other expenses of treatment which the claimant may be required to pay; provided, that all such payments under this chapter shall cease at such time as the City Attorney or the Director of Finance shall determine that one (1) or more of the circumstances enumerated above have changed or that the total sum paid the claimant approximates the amount the claimant is likely to recover by reason of his injury.
