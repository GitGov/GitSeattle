 All housing identified in Sections I-III of the Annual Production Targets shall be available for occupancy solely by households with annual incomes at or below the percentage of median income specified in the Annual Production Targets for a minimum of forty (40) years from the initial date of occupancy of each unit. Subject to requirements associated with any City Funds used for such housing under applicable laws, ordinances, regulations and policies, SHA may request review and modification of this Section: (a) ten (10) years from December 16, 1997; or (b) if Federal Operating Subsidies are reduced or withdrawn.

 SHA shall comply, and shall require all contractor and subcontractors to comply, with all applicable equal employment opportunity and nondiscrimination laws of the United States, the State of Washington, and The City of Seattle, including the Seattle Municipal Code ("SMC"), notably SMC Ch. 20.44, and rules, regulations, orders, and directives of the associated administrative agencies and their officers.

The provisions of this Section shall be inserted into all contracts and subcontracts for work involving City Funds.

 10.2. Women's and Minority Business Utilization

 For Phase I, this Agreement hereby incorporates by reference SMC Ch. 20.46A (the "WMBE Ordinance"). SHA shall fulfill all obligations of a contract-awarding authority under the WMBE Ordinance. Without limiting the foregoing, SHA shall:

 (a) Ensure that each contractor meets the set-asides for WBEs and MBEs established for the contract, if any;

 (b) Make affirmative efforts to utilize WMBEs in performing the contract, whether as contractors, subcontractors, suppliers, or in any other capacity;

 (c) Require that all contractors and subcontractors make affirmative efforts to utilize WMBEs in performance of the contract;

 (d) Maintain records reasonably necessary for monitoring compliance with the provisions of SMC Ch. 20.46A, and submit such information as may be requested by the City's Director of the Executive Services Department in order to monitor and enforce compliance;

 (e) Require that contractors and subcontractors maintain records reasonably necessary for monitoring the contractors' and subcontractors' compliance with the provisions of SMC Ch. 20.46A, and that the contractors and subcontractors submit such information as may be requested by the City's Director of the Executive Services Department in order to monitor and enforce compliance; and

 (f) Include in contracts the provisions required by the WMBE Ordinance.

 10.2.2. Phases II and III

 For Phases II and III, the City does not require any minimum level of WMBE subcontractor participation as a condition of awarding any contract. The City is encouraged when contractors use creative and innovative efforts to ensure that all contracting parties bidding on City funded or City administered contracts have an equal opportunity to participate. However, this goal is not a preference, and the City does not require SHA, nor is SHA permitted, to give any preference to a bidder or proposer for its WMBE utilization or WMBE status. While the City does not require WMBE utilization, the City does require that all City funded contracting be done in a nondiscriminatory manner.

 (a) Non-Discrimination: SHA shall not create, and shall not permit contractors or bidders to create, barriers to open and fair opportunities for WMBEs to participate in contracts, and to obtain or compete for contracts and subcontracts as sources of supplies, equipment, construction and services. SHA shall not, in considering offers from and doing business with contractors and suppliers, knowingly discriminate on the basis of race, color, creed, religion, ethnicity, sex, age, national origin, marital status, sexual orientation, or the presence of any mental or physical disability in an otherwise qualified disabled person.

 (b) Record-Keeping: SHA shall maintain, for at least twelve (12) months after completion of each of Phases I, II and III, all bids or proposals from general contractors, and relevant records and information necessary to document level of utilization of WMBEs and other businesses as subcontractors and suppliers. SHA shall require that its general contractor maintain and provide to the City on request all written quotes, bids, estimates, or proposals submitted to the contractor by all businesses seeking to participate as subcontractors or suppliers. The City shall have the right to inspect and copy such records. SHA and its general contractor shall comply with all record-keeping requirements set forth in any federal rules, regulations or statutes included or referenced in this Agreement, the City Contribution Agreements or the contract documents.

 (c) Affirmative Efforts to Utilize WMBEs: The City encourages the utilization of MBEs and WBEs in contracts funded by the City. The City encourages, and SHA shall encourage with respect to Phases I, II and III, the following practices to open competitive opportunities for WMBEs:

 (i) Attending a pre-bid or pre-solicitation conference, if scheduled, to provide project information and to inform WMBEs of contracting and subcontracting opportunities.

 (ii) Placing all qualified WMBEs attempting to do business in the City on solicitation lists, and providing written notice of subcontracting opportunities to WMBEs capable of performing the work, including without limitation all businesses on any list provided by the City, in sufficient time to allow such businesses to respond to the written solicitations.

 (iii) Breaking down total requirements into smaller tasks or quantities, where economically feasible, in order to permit maximum participation by small businesses including WMBEs.

 (iv) Establishing delivery schedules, where the requirements permit, that encourage participation by WMBEs.

 (v) Providing WMBEs that express interest with adequate and timely information about plans, specifications, and requirements of the contract.

 (vi) Utilizing the services of available minority community organizations, minority contractor groups, local minority assistance offices, the City, and other organizations that provide assistance in the recruitment and placement of WMBEs.

 (d) Sanctions for Violation: Any violation of any mandatory provision of this Section 10.2.2 parts (a) and (b) shall be a material breach of contract for which SHA may be subject to damages and sanctions provided for by contract and by applicable law. SHA's contract with its general contractor shall provide that the contractor may be subject to damages and sanctions for any violation of the provisions of this Section requiring performance by the contractor, and that the City is an intended beneficiary of such contract with respect to those provisions. SHA will not award any contract unless the contractor has first provided SHA with a preliminary statement of ability to comply with those requirements, will take appropriate action upon a finding that the contractor is in violation of any of those requirements.

 10.3. Prevailing Wage Law

 SHA shall comply, and shall cause its contractors to comply, with all applicable prevailing wage laws. Disbursement of City Funds may be conditioned upon receipt by the City of evidence satisfactory to the City that wages have been paid in compliance with this Section.

 10.4 Public Bidding

 SHA shall comply with applicable public bidding law, and shall, at the request of the City, certify and warrant such compliance.

 10.5 Performance Bond

 Prior to disbursement of City Funds, SHA shall provide evidence satisfactory to the Director of OH of compliance with Chapter 39.08 of the Revised Code of Washington.

 10.6 Residential Antidisplacement and Relocation Assistance Plan for Holly Park

 SHA shall comply with the City's Residential Antidisplacement and Relocation Assistance Plan for Holly Park as set forth, and adopted, in Resolution 29678 attached hereto as Attachment B.

 10.7 Compliance with Applicable Law

 SHA shall comply, and shall cause its contractors to comply, with all applicable City, state and federal law, and shall, in accordance with policies and procedures of the Director of OH, certify such compliance to the City upon request by the City. SHA shall hold the City harmless from any loss, damage, expense, claim or demand (including costs and attorneys' fees) resulting from SHA's failure to comply with any applicable City, state or federal law or SHA's failure to maintain adequate records to demonstrate such compliance.

 10.8 Boost Program

 With respect to Phase II work financed with City Funds, SHA shall comply, and shall cause its contractors to comply, with Boost Program rules to be adopted pursuant to Ordinance 119602, provided that the rules are adopted within a time frame that permits their incorporation into Phase II contracts and further provided that incorporation of the rules is otherwise feasible.

 The following are events of default by SHA under this Agreement:

 (a) Failure by SHA to comply with any term or provision of this Agreement within ninety (90) days of written notification from the City of SHA's breach or nonperformance of any term or condition; provided that if the breach or nonperformance cannot reasonably be cured within ninety (90) days then so long as SHA is diligently pursuing cure and such cure is completed within a reasonable period, it shall not be an event of default.

 (b) An event of default under any City Contribution Agreement.

 (c) An event of default under any Other Financing Document.

 Upon the occurrence of an event of default by SHA:

 (a) the City may cease making disbursements and providing credits, facilities, equipment and services from all City Funds under this Agreement and any City Contribution Agreement;

 (b) upon demand by the City, SHA shall pay the City an amount equivalent to the value of all City Funds that have been provided under this Agreement or any City Contribution Agreement;

 (c) the City may terminate this Agreement; and

 If the City fails to perform any material obligation under this Agreement within ninety (90) days of written notification from SHA of the City's breach or nonperformance, SHA may exercise such rights or remedies available at law or equity; provided that SHA shall not pursue any such rights or remedies if the breach or nonperformance cannot reasonably be cured within ninety (90) days and the City is diligently pursuing cure.

 11.7. Non-Waiver

 Failure to promptly enforce compliance with any term or provision of this Agreement shall not constitute a waiver or limitation of any right or remedy under this Agreement. No waiver shall be effective unless in writing. A waiver of any breach of this Agreement shall not constitute a waiver of any subsequent breach of the same or different provision of this Agreement.

 11.8. No Assignment

 Except as expressly provided in this Agreement, neither SHA nor the City shall assign any of its rights or interests or delegate any of its obligations or duties under this Agreement without the prior written approval of the other.
