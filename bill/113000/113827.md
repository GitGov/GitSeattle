 AN ORDINANCE relating to water conservation, increasing voluntary, cost-effective water conservation in Seattle, establishing a Water Bank and Environmental Block, creating the "Everyone Can Conserve" program to fund water conservation in low-income housing, and establishing that a primary source for funding for the conservation program shall be rates charged on residents and businesses that use extraordinary amounts of water.

 WHEREAS, Over 26,000 signatures were submitted on Initiative 63, demonstrating that the Citizens of Seattle strongly support the goal of increasing water conservation for the environment; and

 WHEREAS, The City Council agrees with this goal and, together with the proponents of Initiative 63, has developed this ordinance as a Substitute for Initiative 63 to resolve legal challenge and to reaffirm the City's commitment to regional conservation solutions, and to increase administrative efficiency; and

 WHEREAS, Seattle Citizens recognize that additional water conservation is necessary to balance the needs of our growing community and a healthy environment, and to avoid the future expense of developing new water sources; and

 WHEREAS, Seattle Citizens want a cost-effective conservation program that allows all individuals, regardless of their income, to contribute, by assisting in the retrofitting of low-income housing for water conservation. The public benefit of such a program would outweigh any incidental benefit to the participants in the program, as demonstrated by the City's successful programs providing weatherization and other energy conservation measures in low-income housing; and

 WHEREAS, Citizens of Seattle want a conservation program that respects personal and business choices about water consumption. However, those who choose to use extraordinary amounts of water should pay more because increased demand raises costs to all customers by burdening the community to fund additional conservation and to prematurely establish new, more expensive water supplies; and

 WHEREAS, Citizens of Seattle congratulate Seattle Public Utilities for its leadership in water conservation, including its Cedar River Habitat Conservation Plan, its work to extol environmental stewardship and conservation regionally through the Central Puget Sound Water Purveyor's Forum, and its commitment to working in partnership with the environmental community; and

 WHEREAS, The City of Seattle is committed to regional conservation, and is developing programs and policies that enhance holistic water resource management and the stewardship of the region's natural resources. Now, Therefore,

 BE IT ORDAINED BY THE CITY OF SEATTLE AS FOLLOWS:

 Section 1. Accelerated Conservation.

 To protect our natural environment, Seattle shall speed up its implementation of voluntary, cost-effective water conservation as follows:

 A. Seattle shall expand and accelerate its water conservation program such that by December 31, 2010, the City will be conserving an additional 12 mgd of water within the City of Seattle retail service area, as compared with water consumption in Seattle's retail service area during year 2000.

 B. The measures to be implemented under Section 2.A shall be voluntary on the part of customers, and do not include mandatory measures such as irrigation bans that would reduce customer service.

 C. Seattle Public Utilities shall update Seattle's Conservation Potential Assessment ("CPA") every four years, with the first update completed in 2004 and, beginning in 2010, shall implement all cost-effective conservation measures within the City of Seattle retail service area within eight years after the measure is identified. However, if a conservation measure is found to be cost-effective only if implemented over a period of longer than eight years, such measure shall be implemented on the shortest timeline upon which its implementation is cost-effective.

 D. Seattle Public Utilities shall annually track the water supply created by Seattle's conservation measures after passage of this ordinance.

 Section 2. Establishment of a Water Bank and Environmental Block.

 A. It is the intent of this ordinance as a Substitute for Initiative 63 to establish a Water Bank and environmental block of water for the purpose of protecting the environment and assisting salmon recovery by increasing flows in fish-bearing creeks and rivers where Seattle can legally supply that water.

 B. A supply of water will be set aside to achieve this purpose, which shall be known as the "environmental block" of water. Seattle Public Utilities shall provide the following amounts of water to the environmental block to be used for fish as provided in this section:

 Size of environmental block Years

 (1) 2 mgd By December 31, 2001;

 (2) 4 mgd By December 31, 2002;

 (3) 6 mgd By December 31, 2006, or sooner at such time that the Tacoma Second Supply Project becomes fully operational;

 (4) 9 mgd By December 31, 2010, or sooner, if the City, in conjunction with the Operating Board created by the 2001 Full Requirements Contracts, and the Central Puget Sound Water Suppliers Forum, reasonably determines based on the best available scientific data that the additional water is needed sooner by fish;

 (5) [12 mgd] By December 31, 2015, the environmental block shall increase to and remain at 12 mgd, unless the City, in conjunction with the Operating Board created by the 2001 Full Requirements Contracts, and the Central Puget Sound Water Suppliers Forum, reasonably determines based on the best available scientific data available that the additional 3 mgd is not needed by fish, in which case the environmental block shall remain 9 mgd.

 Sources of water for the environmental block may include water from conservation acquired elsewhere in the region, reused and reclaimed stormwater and wastewater, and other sources.

 The environmental block shall be maintained at the above levels at all times during the year, including summer peak periods and times of fish needs.

 C. The environmental block of water shall be used to protect the environment and assist salmon recovery by increasing flows in fish- bearing creeks and rivers, through one or more of the following mechanisms:

 (1) Placing the water in the State's water trust program, for the benefit of the environment and salmon through in-stream flows; or

 (2) Leaving the water in the rivers that supply Seattle's water, or a tributary thereof, to benefit the environment and salmon; or

 (3) Making the water available directly or through a Water Bank to other water districts or municipalities to replace an existing withdrawal or diversion of water that threatens salmon or other priority fish species (e.g., to replace a withdrawal from an aquifer that threatens to dewater a salmon-bearing creek) or to meet public health needs if required by law as determined by the Washington State Department of Health. Water from this program may be used only when the environmental benefit of such use is demonstrated by best available science, and only pursuant to a contract requiring, at a minimum, that:

 (a) the Water Bank water will result in at least a gallon for gallon reduction in withdrawal from a municipal water supply source that has been demonstrated by reasonable scientific analysis to be in continuity with surface waters used by anadromous or other priority fish species; and

 (b) the entity using the water agrees to implement cost-effective conservation measures and metering within its service territory. The Director of SPU shall adopt additional requirements for this program and a template for the contractual agreement defining the procedures for implementation and reporting of the conservation measures and metering.

 (c) The Director of SPU may propose that this Water Bank be operated as a regional entity. Such proposal may be made to the Operating Board established under the full requirement contracts for the supply of water entered into by the City in 2001.

 Section 3. The "Everyone Can Conserve" Program.

 A. Within six months after passage of this ordinance, the City shall design and implement the "Everyone Can Conserve" Program to retrofit Qualifying Low-income Units and Qualifying Low-income Buildings within the City's retail service area for water conservation. The Program shall be administered jointly by Seattle Public Utilities and the Office of Housing. The Directors of Seattle Public Utilities and the Office of Housing shall adopt rules for administration of the Program, including verification of eligibility, conservation priorities, inspection of work, and all other matters, and shall have all authority necessary to implement the Program.

 B. At a minimum, the Program shall:

 (1) Assist with supply and installation of cost-effective water conservation measures within Qualifying Low-income Units, with the assistance ratio and per unit assistance cap as follows:

 Qualifying Low-income Units that house extremely low-income individuals or families or that are owner-occupied: 100% assistance, to a maximum per unit assistance of $600, adjusted for inflation;

 Other Qualifying Low-income Units: 50% assistance, to a maximum per unit assistance of $300, adjusted for inflation; and

 (2) Assist with supply and installation of cost-effective water conservation measures in common areas of Qualifying Low-Income Buildings, with the assistance ratio and per unit assistance cap as follows:

 Qualifying Low-income Buildings in which at least 80% of units are Qualifying Low-income Units housing extremely low-income individuals or families: 100% assistance to a maximum per building assistance equivalent to $200 per Qualifying Low-income Unit, adjusted for inflation.

 Other Qualifying Low-income Buildings: 50% assistance to a maximum per building assistance equivalent to $100 per Qualifying Low- income Unit, adjusted for inflation.

 (3) The administering agencies may increase the ratio of assistance, the maximum per unit assistance, or the maximum per building assistance above those mandated herein. The administering agencies may provide assistance through grants or reimbursements, through providing materials and installation, or a combination thereof.

 (4) The administering agencies shall use their best efforts to retrofit substantially all Qualifying Low-income Units and Qualifying Low-income Buildings by December 31, 2010.

 Section 4. Rate Structures Providing Conservation Incentives.

 A. In recognition of contractual limitations, any additional costs associated with accelerating conservation within the Seattle service area that exceeds the anticipated costs of existing programs shall be borne by Seattle retail service area residential and commercial customers. SPU shall recommend a methodology for equitably distributing conservation costs between residential and commercial customers as part of the rate design study required in Paragraph 4.C below.

 B. The conservation required by this ordinance shall be funded, at least in part, by revenue from the residential summer peak use third block, which was proposed by Initiative 63 and thereafter adopted by Ordinance. That rate structure may be amended as appropriate.

 C. An equitable portion of the costs of implementing this ordinance shall be borne by commercial users. Within one year after passage of this ordinance, SPU shall present to the Council options for and recommendations for a rate design for commercial customers that will provide a rate incentive for additional conservation, and the Council will adjust rates soon thereafter.

 D. SPU shall expand its current program of auditing commercial customers, implementing conservation measures, and providing incentives where appropriate.

 E. If the conservation rate structure is ever invalidated or halted, the City Council shall provide an alternative method of funding the "Everyone Can Conserve Program" and other requirements of this ordinance consistent with the intent of Sections 4.B and C.

 F. The Director of SPU shall at the same time as providing the recommendations in Section 4.C make recommendations to the Council for establishing exceptions in the new rates adopted for customers or classes of customers who demonstrate water conservation or for whom the rate would create an undue hardship.

 Section 5. Conservation Planning And Compliance.

 A. Within eighteen months after passage of this ordinance as a Substitute for Initiative 63, the City shall adopt a revised Water Conservation Plan outlining the steps and timeline for implementation of this ordinance. Seattle Public Utilities shall thereafter demonstrate compliance with this ordinance through annual reporting, a summary of which shall be communicated to ratepayers.

 B. The mandates of this ordinance create non-discretionary duties for the City and its agencies, and any Seattle resident or organization shall have standing to seek enforcement of such duties by mandamus or other action, provided such action seeks to advance this ordinance's purpose as stated in Section 7. In order to attempt to settle issues and avoid possible litigation, the City shall respond in writing within thirty days to a written citizen claim that the City has failed to abide by the non-discretionary mandates of this ordinance, and the City shall designate representatives to meet with the citizens, if so requested. If litigation does result, and the City of Seattle is found to have willfully violated the mandates of this ordinance, the parties bringing the action shall be entitled to recover reasonable costs and attorneys fees incurred in bringing the action unless the court finds that the position of the City was substantially justified or there are other exceptional circumstances making the award of fees and costs unjust, provided that, the plaintiff, within thirty days of filing a complaint, stipulates that the plaintiff will pay the City its reasonable costs and attorneys fees if the City is determined to be the prevailing party.

 Section 6. Definitions.

 A. "Conservation Potential Assessment." A document prepared by Seattle Public Utilities that, at a minimum, contains the components of analysis contained in the 1998 Conservation Potential Assessment, including an analysis of cost-effective water conservation measures as defined by this ordinance.

 B. "Cost-effective water conservation" or "cost-effective water conservation measures." Any conservation measure, including water reuse and metering, that can be implemented at a cost that is less than that of the next available source of water supply, as identified in Seattle's current Water System Plan. This calculation must also take into consideration the following factors (1) a 15% multiplier to increase the calculated benefit of conservation measures to account for economic and ecological benefits of conservation; and (2) best estimates of other benefits obtained by conservation measures, including savings relating to reduced demand for electricity, sewer, wastewater, etc. In assessing what measures are cost-effective, potential timeline and geographic scope of implementation may be considered.

 C. "Extremely low-income" Individuals or families earning less than 30% of median income.

 D. "Median income" See SMC 21.04.280.

 E. "Qualifying low-income building." A building in which at least 80% of units are Qualified Low-income Units.
