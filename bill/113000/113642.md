 ORDINANCE __________________

 AN ORDINANCE related to the Seattle Public Utilities; authorizing an agreement for the design, construction, and operation of a Cedar River water treatment facility, and the design and construction of related components.

 WHEREAS, the City has determined to build a new water treatment facility at the Lake Youngs Reservation to treat Cedar River water in order to meet all current drinking water regulations, including the Cedar Agreed Order, as amended, to provide additional public heath protection against waterborne pathogens, and to substantially improve the periodic taste and odor of water from the Lake Youngs Reservoir; and

 WHEREAS, the City is authorized under RCW Chapter 39.10 to undertake alternative public works contracting procedures, including design-build contracts involving projects valued at over ten million dollars where the construction activities are highly specialized and a design-build approach is critical in developing the construction methodology; and

 WHEREAS, Seattle Public Utilities ("SPU") has successfully implemented a similar design-build-operate project for its Tolt Treatment Facility; and

 WHEREAS, in accordance with the requirements of RCW Chapter 39.10, the City issued a request for proposals (the "RFP") for the design, construction, and operation of a water treatment facility to treat 180 million gallons per day of raw water in compliance with all current and reasonably anticipated primary and interim primary drinking water regulations (the "Facility"); and

 WHEREAS, the RFP also included requirements for the selected proposer to design and construct certain modifications to SPU existing water supply and transmissions system and turnover operations of these components to SPU for operations (the "Related Components"); and

 WHEREAS, proposals deemed by SPU to be responsive to the RFP were received from two of the three qualified finalists; and

 WHEREAS, both of the two responsive proposals met or exceeded all of the RFP requirements; and

 WHEREAS, based on the further evaluation of its selection committee and the criteria set forth in the RFP, including but not limited to proposal price, financial qualifications, ability of professional personnel, past performance on similar projects, ability to meet time and budget requirements, ability to provide a performance and payment bond for the project, recent, current and projected workloads of firm, and the concept of the proposal, and utilizing the factors, weighting and process identified in the RFP, the City selected the proposal submitted by the CH2M Hill Mortenson OMI team as the highest ranked proposal; and

 WHEREAS, the City has initiated contract negotiations with the CH2M Hill Mortenson OMI team; and

 WHEREAS, the City expects to successfully negotiate an agreement with the CH2M Hill Mortenson OMI team consistent with the RFP, and is prepared to enter into a contract with CH2M Hill Constructors Inc;
