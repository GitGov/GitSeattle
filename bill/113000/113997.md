 AMENDMENT TO LEASE AND CONCESSION AGREEMENT

 BETWEEN THE CITY OF SEATTLE AND

 FUN FOREST AMUSEMENTS, INC.

 This Amendment is entered into by and between THE CITY OF SEATTLE (hereinafter called "City"), a first class City of the State of Washington, acting by and through the Director of the Seattle Center Department, and FUN FOREST AMUSEMENTS, INC. (hereinafter called "CONCESSIONAIRE"), a Washington corporation:

 WHEREAS, on October 27, 1997 the City and Concessionaire entered into a Lease and Concession Agreement ("Agreement") for the construction and operation of concession games of skill, chance and amusement; amusement rides; and the sale of foods, beverages, souvenirs and concession merchandise; and for the use of office space and storage space, for a term commencing November 1, 1996, and ending December 31, 2014; and

 WHEREAS, as a part of the Agreement, the Concessionaire was required and has constructed capital improvements to the premises valued at approximately Eight Million One Hundred Fifty Three Thousand Dollars ($8,153,000) defined in the Agreement as the "Concessionaire's Initial Capital Improvements"; and

 WHEREAS, Concessionaire and the City have agreed to changes to the Agreement, have performed according to such changes and wish to incorporate these changes into the Agreement; and

 WHEREAS, the Concessionaire is not currently in default with respect to any of the Concessionaire's material obligations to the City under the Agreement; and

 NOW, THEREFORE, the parties agree that the Agreement shall be amended as follows:

 Part A

 Special Covenants & Conditions of Agreement

 Subsection A-6.c of the Agreement is hereby amended to read as follows:

 A-6 CONCESSION FEE FOR PRIZE CONCESSION GAMES

 c. Annual Concession Fee Due For The Period From January 1, 2000, Or The Date Concessionaire's Initial Capital Improvements Are Substantially Complete, Whichever Is Earlier until the Expiration or Earlier Termination of the Agreement:

 Ninety Thousand Dollars ($90,000); Provided, that for the partial year following the date on which Concessionaire's Initial Capital Improvements are substantially complete, the fee shall be prorated by dividing $90,000 by 365 and multiplying the resulting quotient by the number of days from and after the day immediately following the date the Concessionaire's Initial Capital Improvements are substantially complete, through December 31 of that year, inclusive.

 Subsection A-9.c (2) of the Agreement is hereby amended to read as follows:

 A-9 OTHER CHARGES

 c. Entertainment Building Parking Covenant Charge:

 (1) For the period between June 1 and December 31, 1997, inclusive: $10,208.33

 (2) For calendar year 1998, the Base Amount of $17,500 shall be the entertainment building parking covenant charge ("Parking Charge"). Commencing January 1, 1999 and continuing each January 1st during the term of this Agreement, the Parking Charge for a given year shall be the Base Amount of $17,500.00 adjusted by the sum of annual percentage increase(s) (beginning with 1998) that occurred during the preceding calendar year(s) (hereinafter "Adjustment Percentage") in the Consumer Price Index for All Urban Consumers ("CPI-U") Seattle-Tacoma-Bremerton, WA Area (the "Index") using the base 1982-84 = 100, as published by the U.S. Department of Labor, Bureau of Labor Statistics, or its successor. Should any year's CPI percentage change be less than zero, the change to the Adjustment Percentage for that year shall be set at zero percent (0%). Therefore, in no case shall any year's Entertainment Building Parking Covenant Charge be less than the prior year's amount. In the event of any change in the Index base (1982-84=100) or other modification of the CPI Index, or in the event the CPI is discontinued, the Director shall select a similar index of comparable statistics on the cost of living for King County as shall be computed by an agency of the United States or by a responsible financial periodical or other recognized authority.

 For example, if the annual CPI-U index percentage change for the first, second and third calendar years were a%, b% and c% respectively, the Adjustment Percentage for the fourth year would be (a% + b% + c%) and the Parking Charge for the fourth year would be (a% + b% + c%) x $17,5000.

 Section A-10 of the Agreement is hereby amended to add a new subsection A-10.b, as follows:

 A-10 AUTHORIZED USE OF PREMISES BY CONCESSIONAIRE

 a. The Sites shall be used by Concessionaire only for the construction and operation of concession games of skill, chance and amusement, amusement rides, and the sale of foods, beverages, souvenirs and concession merchandise. The Office Space shall be used for general office services and storage. Concessionaire may use the Premises for other purposes only with the consent of the Director, which may be granted, conditioned or withheld at the discretion of the Director.

 b. The City has determined that it does not want development of the 4th Avenue North & Thomas Street Building Pad site, approximately in the location delineated on Part G attached hereto and incorporated herein by this reference (hereinafter "Placeholder"), for commercial use. The City and Concessionaire acknowledge that the Placeholder is not a site where the City would authorize placement of a ride. Therefore, the City desires and so designates the use for the Placeholder site as open space but reserves the sole right to change the site's designated use, or designate this area or nearby area for placement of an information kiosk and/or directional signage. Should the City change the designation of the Placeholder site to commercial use, the City will first offer in writing terms for use of the Placeholder site to the Concessionaire and provide a designated period of time of no less than ten (10) days for the concessionaire to respond prior to offering the opportunity to lease the Placeholder site to any other party. Should the concessionaire accept terms for use of the Placeholder site, the term of the concessionaire's use shall run concurrent with the primary lease.
