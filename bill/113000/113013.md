 AN ORDINANCE relating to library facilities; changing the allocation of Bond proceeds set forth in Section 1, Ordinance 119019 from the neighborhood library facilities component to the central library component to reflect a designated gift to the neighborhood library facilities component; and directing the execution of a contract with the Library Board in which the City commits to future City funding of neighborhood branch library facilities in accordance with the Libraries for All Capital Plan; all by a two-thirds vote of the City Council.

 WHEREAS, Ordinance 119019, relating to library facilities; providing for the submission to the voters of the City, at an election to be held therein in conjunction with the state election to be held on the same date, of a proposition authorizing the City to incur indebtedness by issuing its general obligation bonds or other evidence of indebtedness (the "Bonds"), payable in part by annual property tax levies to be made in excess of regular property tax levies, for the purpose of paying all or a part of the cost of designing, constructing, acquiring, improving, renovating, and equipping neighborhood and central library facilities and to levy those excess property taxes; and requesting an election, was passed by the City Council on May 26, 1998; and,

 WHEREAS, pursuant to Ordinance 119019, a proposition authorizing the City to incur indebtedness for library facilities was placed on the ballot at the November 3, 1998 election, and said ballot measure was passed by the voters of the City; and,

 WHEREAS, The Seattle Public Library received a gift in the amount of Fifteen Million Dollars from the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, which gift has been designated by the Gates Foundation to be used only for the neighborhood library facilities component; and,

 WHEREAS, the City remains committed to providing, for neighborhood library facilities, the $10.3 million in non-Bond City funds originally contemplated to carry out the Libraries for All capital plan, and wishes to provide reassurance that it will meet its commitment, whether from the Cumulative Reserve Subfund or from other non-Bond City sources; and

 WHEREAS, The City Council has decided that it is in the best interest of the City and its Public Library to change the allocation of Bond funds to reflect the resulting overage by reducing the neighborhood library facilities component by fifteen million dollars and increasing the central library component by fifteen million dollars where such a reallocation seeks to keep both components within the budget parameters approved by the voters; and,

 WHEREAS, Section 3 of Ordinance 119019 places procedural prerequisites on the City Council before it can change the allocation of Bond proceeds set forth in Section 1 of Ordinance 119019; NOW, THEREFORE,

 BE IT ORDAINED BY THE CITY OF SEATTLE AS FOLLOWS:

 Section 1. The City Council finds that the Seattle Public Library Board of Trustees (the "Board") has considered the proposed change to the allocation of Bond proceeds, and as reflected in the minutes of the October 4, 1999 meeting, the Board recommended the change in allocation.

 Section 2. The City Council finds that the Libraries for All Oversight Committee (the "Committee") has considered the proposed change to the allocation of Bond proceeds, and as reflected by the minutes of the September 10, 1999 meeting, the Committee recommended the change in allocation.

 Section 3. The City Council finds that the Mayor has considered the proposed change to the allocation of Bond proceeds, and by letter dated October 6, 1999, the Mayor recommended the change in allocation.

 Section 4. The City Council held a public hearing on this matter on November 9, 1999.

 Section 5. The City Council, having considered the recommendations of the Board, the Committee, and the Mayor, and the testimony received at the public hearing, finds that the provisions of Section 3 of Ordinance 119019 have been met, and that reallocation of the Bond proceeds is in the best interest of the City in order to ensure that funds from Bond proceeds and other sources are applied to the program components listed in Ordinance 119019 in a manner consistent with the parameters approved by the voters.

 Section 6. The allocation of Fifty Seven Million Nine Hundred Thousand Dollars ($57,900,000) to the neighborhood library facilities component in Section 1, Ordinance 119019 is reduced by Fifteen Million Dollars ($15,000,000) to Forty-Two Million Nine Hundred Thousand Dollars ($42,900,000).

 Section 7. The allocation of One Hundred Twenty-Eight Million Six Hundred Thousand Dollars ($128,600,000) to the central library component in Section 1, Ordinance 119019 is increased by Fifteen Million Dollars ($15,000,000) to One Hundred Forty-Three Million, Six Hundred Thousand Dollars ($143,600,000).

 Section 8. The executive is authorized and directed to execute a contract by December 31, 1999, with the Board committing the City to provide $10.3 million in non-Bond City funding for the neighborhood library facilities component of the Libraries for All program as follows: $2.410 million in 2001; $2.617 million in 2002; $1.204 million in 2003; $1.198 million in 2004; $1.416 million in 2005; and $1.455 million in 2006. The yearly amounts may be adjusted, before or after the contract is executed, by mutual agreement of the City and the Board but by 2006 the total amount will be at least $10.3 million.

 The contract shall provide that this funding is contemplated to be from the Cumulative Reserve Subfund of the City, but it shall not preclude the use instead of other City resources not derived from the voter-approved Bonds.

 Section 9. As part of future annual budget processes, the Council shall take into account progress in completing the neighborhood libraries and availability of funding for the neighborhood libraries in determining whether further reallocation of Libraries For All bond funds is necessary to complete the improvements consistent with the Libraries For All capital Program.

 Section 10. This ordinance shall take effect and be in force thirty (30) days from and after its approval by the Mayor, but if not approved and returned by the Mayor within ten (10) days after presentation, it shall take effect as provided by Municipal Code Section 1.04.020.
