 Definitions.

 1. The phrase "delegated pay discretion" describes compensation programs in which the appointing authority, in accordance with guidelines and procedures established by the Personnel Director, is granted discretion to set pay within the salary range.

 ((1.))2. "Limited term assignment" means the temporary assignment of duties and responsibilities typically associated with one (1) position to the incumbent ("assignee") of another position when the assignee's position is allocated to ((the Manager or Strategic Advisor )) a classification in a compensation program with delegated pay discretion ((and compensation programs)).

 ((2.))3. "Out-of-class assignment" means the temporary assignment of duties and responsibilities associated with a higher-paid position to the incumbent of a lower-paid position when the incumbent's position consist of consecutive work hours or work days. The threshold must be satisfied for each out-of-class or limited term assignment.

 C. An employee whose regular position is not included in ((the)) a compensation program with delegated pay discretion ((APEX, Manager or Strategic Advisor programs)) may be assigned to work out-of-class in a higher-paid position that is not included in ((the)) a compensation program with delegated pay discretion ((APEX, Manager or Strategic Advisor programs)); or may be assigned to work out-of-class in a position that is allocated to a ((Manager or Strategic Advisor)) classification in a compensation program with delegated pay discretion. Unless approved by the Classification and Compensation Director of the Personnel Division of the Executive Services Department, an employee who is not a Manager or Strategic Advisor may not be assigned to work out-of-class in an APEX position.

 Payment for the out-of-class assignment shall be determined as in promotion (Seattle Municipal Code Section 4.20.080 B).

 The threshold for payment of an out-of-class rate of pay is four (4) hours for hourly employees and ten (10) days for salaried employees.

 Hours worked in an out-of-class assignment will be credited toward salary step placement in the event the employee who was so assigned is promoted, or his or her position reclassified, to the same class as the out-of-class assignment, within twelve (12) months of the end of such out-of-class assignment; except that hours worked in an out-of- class assignment to a ((Manager or Strategic Advisor)) classification in a compensation program with delegated pay discretion shall not be counted toward salary placement in the event of promotion or reclassification to a ((Manager or Strategic Advisor)) classification in a compensation program with delegated pay discretion.

 For each consecutive twelve (12) month period that an employee is assigned to perform the same out-of-class duties on a full-time, continuous basis he or she will receive a step increment in the higher salary range; provided, that he or she has not already received an increment because of increases to the primary pay rate; provided further, that such increment does not exceed the top step of the higher salary range.

 D. An employee of a compensation program with delegated pay discretion ((Manager or Strategic Advisor)) may be assigned by proper authority to perform some or all of the duties associated with another classification or position on a limited term assignment. The appointing authority may grant a temporary increase to the employee's base salary to compensate him or her for the limited term assignment, but may not exceed the maximum of the pay zone to which the employee's regular position is allocated; provided, that such employee may be given a limited term assignment to a position assigned to the Accountability Pay for Executives (APEX) Program and paid at the minimum rate of the appropriate market group if such minimum rate exceeds his or her normal rate of pay. The threshold for compensation for a limited term assignment is ten (10) days.

 Section 8. Information Technology Professional Program: rates of pay for out-of-class assignments. Effective January 5, 2000, the following titles and rates of pay for the out-of-class (OOC) assignment of employees not regularly assigned to Information Technology Professional positions are established.

 IT Pay Band A OOC, Exempt: $30.58 $31.92 $33.32 $34.79 $36.31 $37.91 $39.57 $41.30

Information Technology out-of-class titles are only for regular employee out-of-class use in Information Technology Professional work assignments and shall not be used for the assignment of intermittent employees to any Information Technology Professional title.

 Section 9. Establishing guidelines for temporary employees in Information Technology Professional positions. Temporary Information Technology Professional employees shall receive no more than the equivalent of the base of the range of the corresponding regular class for all hours worked. Temporary IT Professional employees must receive pay consistent with the work they are assigned to perform and in accordance with procedures established by the Personnel Director. Temporary employees will receive premium pay in lieu of paid leave or benefits in addition to their hourly rate of pay.

 Section 10. This ordinance shall take effect and be in force thirty (30) days from and after its approval by the Mayor, but if not approved and returned by the Mayor within ten (10) days after presentation, it shall take effect as provided by Municipal Code Section 1.04.020.
