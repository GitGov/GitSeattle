 AN ORDINANCE relating to the levy of property taxes; fixing the rates and/or amounts of taxes to be levied, and levying the same upon all taxable property, both real and personal, in the City of Seattle, to finance the departments and activities of City government and to provide for the General Obligation Bond Interest and Redemption requirements for the year beginning on the first day of January 2002; and by a vote of a majority plus one of the Seattle City Council, finding a substantial need to use, and providing for the use of, 106% as the regular property tax limit factor or such lesser maximum amount as allowed by law.

 BE IT ORDAINED BY THE CITY OF SEATTLE AS FOLLOWS:

 Section 1. General Municipal and Firefighters' Pension.

 A. (i) There is hereby levied a tax on all taxable property, both real and personal, within the City of Seattle and subject to taxation under the laws of the State of Washington, at the rate of Three Dollars and Sixty Cents ($3.60) per thousand dollars of the assessed value of such property, which is estimated to be Two Hundred Sixty-one Million Two Hundred Fifty Thousand Nine Hundred Twenty-nine Dollars ($261,250,929). This tax is levied for the purpose of raising revenue to finance the various departments and activities of the municipal government of the City of Seattle for the fiscal (calendar) year 2002. The following two sentences are provided for information only: This levy has been calculated at the following dollar rates per thousand dollars of assessed value: Three Dollars and Fifteen Cents ($3.15) for general municipal purposes as allowed by RCW 84.52.043; Twenty-two and One-half Cents ($0.225) for the Firemen's Pension Fund as allowed by RCW 41.16.060; and Twenty-two and One-half Cents ($0.225) for general municipal purposes as allowed by RCW 41.16.060. This levy includes an amount of Eight Hundred Twenty-eight Thousand Dollars ($828,000) for low-income housing that is not restricted to serving very low- income households, in accordance with Ordinance 117711; an amount of Ten Million Dollars ($10,000,000) for educational and developmental services in accordance with Ordinance 118557; an amount of Sixteen Million Dollars ($16,000,000) to improve the Opera House, replace the Flag Pavilion, and expand nine Parks Department community recreation centers in accordance with Ordinance 119522, and an amount of Twenty-three Million Seven Hundred and Thirteen Thousand Dollars ($23,713,000) for neighborhood parks, green spaces, trails, and the zoo in accordance with Ordinance 120024.

 (ii) In addition, there is also hereby levied a tax on all taxable property, both real and personal, within the City of Seattle and subject to taxation under the laws of the State of Washington, in the amount of Seven Million Six Hundred Thirty Thousand Seven Hundred Fourteen Dollars ($7,630,714), such tax being levied for the purpose of financing affordable housing for very low-income households pursuant to RCW 84.52.105, pursuant to Ordinance 117711, which tax levy shall be outside of and in addition to the limitations in RCW 84.52.043.

 B. If the total of the amounts of taxes stated in subsections 1.A (i) and (ii) or the total of the tax rate stated in subsection 1.A (i) and the rate necessary to generate the amount of taxes stated in subsection 1.A.(ii) would be in excess of any maximum allowed by law or by vote of the people of the City of Seattle pursuant to RCW 84.55.050, then such taxes shall be reduced to the maximum amount allowed or the amount computed by applying the maximum rate to the value of the taxable property. The maximum amount of regular property taxes allowed by vote of the people shall be determined for purposes of this subsection as follows: There shall be determined the amount of regular City property taxes that could have been levied for collection in 2002 had the voters approved none of the levy lid lift measures submitted pursuant to RCW 84.55.050 and Ordinances 117711, 118557, 119522, and 120024. This amount shall be computed as One Hundred One percent (101%) of the general purpose regular property taxes levied for collection in 2001, plus the levy for tax refunds authorized by RCW 84.68.040 and RCW 84.55.070, plus the allowance for new construction and increases in state-assessed property value authorized by RCW 84.55.010 as calculated by the King County Assessor, plus One and Nine-tenths percent (1.9%) of the regular property taxes levied for collection in 2000 and devoted to general purposes, the latter amount representing unused regular levy capacity the City "banked" last year pursuant to RCW 84.55.092. Then, to that total amount shall be added the four (4) dollar amounts set forth in the last sentence of subsection 1.A(i) as authorized for 2002 collection by the voters of the City pursuant to RCW 84.55.050 and those enumerated ordinances, plus the dollar amount set forth in subsection 1.A(ii).

 Section 2. Pursuant to Chapter 3, Laws of 1997, as approved by the voters of the state on November 4, 1997, and pursuant to Resolution 30224 adopting the City Council's and Mayor's top budget priorities for the 2001 and 2002 budgets and in order to carry out those budget priorities and the 2002-2007 Capital Improvement Program, the City Council finds that there is a substantial need to use and hereby does use one hundred six percent (106%) as the regular property tax limit factor, formerly known as the "106% lid," for regular property taxes to be collected in 2002. If the City Council is prohibited from using 106% as the regular property tax limit factor, the City Council finds that there is a substantial need to use and hereby does use the highest lawfully allowable limit factor which is less than 106%.

 Section 3. Voter-approved excess taxes for bonds. In addition, a further tax is hereby levied to raise revenue to provide for the interest on and redemption of voter-approved general obligation bonds for the fiscal year 2002 in the amount of Twenty Million Six Hundred Sixty Thousand Three Hundred Thirty-six Dollars ($20,660,336). This tax is applicable to all taxable property within the City of Seattle.

 Section 4. Severability. The several provisions of this ordinance are declared to be separate and severable and the invalidity of any clause, sentence, paragraph, subdivision, section, subsection, or portion of this ordinance, or the invalidity of the application thereof to any person, property, or circumstance, shall not affect the validity of the remainder of this ordinance or the validity of its application to other persons, property, or circumstances.

 Section 5. Ratification and confirmation of prior acts. Any act consistent with the authority and prior to the effective date of this ordinance is hereby ratified and confirmed.

 Section 6. Effective date. This ordinance shall take effect and be in force thirty (30) days from and after its approval by the Mayor, but if not approved and returned by the Mayor within ten (10) days after presentation, it shall take effect as provided by Municipal Code Section 1.04.020.
