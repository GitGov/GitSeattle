 Director of Marketing

 Seattle Center

 Seattle, WA 98109

 Dear Jennifer,

 In our discussions of Northwest Folklife's new contract with the City, we agreed to review our need to erect canopies on Sunday and Virginia Anderson's very legitimate wish to keep the grounds free of unused paraphernalia for as much of the weekend as possible. The purpose of this letter is to address this question in detail and to propose an alternative to Sunday morning work.

 As you know, our production crews and decorators start the load-in for Northwest Folklife on the Sunday prior to the Festival. We do this out of necessity for the huge number of projects, stages and activities that need to be set up in time for the Festival opening on Friday at 11:00 AM. There are many years when we are still scrambling to get everything done on Friday morning. In a word, there is no time to waste. Every minute between the end of the Seattle International Children's Festival and our start is critical.

 Realizing that weekend traffic, especially in the mornings, has increased at Seattle Center with the opening of the EMP and agreeing with that Virginia Anderson that everything must be done to mitigate the visual impact of canopies that are not actually in use, I would like to propose the following alternative to loading in on Sunday morning.

 ? We do not start erecting canopies until 4:00 PM on Sunday afternoon.

 ? After 4:00 on Sunday, we would erect canopies around the grounds in pockets that do not disturb activities. I proposed the following sites: Seattle Center Pavilion Courtyard, Alki Courtyard, the Bagley Roadway and the Mural Roadway (facing the Mural Amphitheatre).

 ? After 6:00 pm on Sunday, we would erect the canopies in the Northwest Court, across from Michaelangelos on Thomas Street and set up all the stages.

 ? In those years when the Seattle International Children's Festival loads out on the Sunday before our Festival, the canopies that we intend to reuse would be allowed to remain in place until Monday morning when we move them to the locations required for our event.

 Our schedule now calls for erecting canopies on Sunday, stringing sidewalls on Monday and Tuesday, loading equipment into the tents on Tuesday, and having the tents ready for sponsor load-in on Wednesday. I cannot stress enough how much we need the time on Sunday. Without it, it is impossible for us to finish everything in time to open on Friday.

 I know you understand how important this issue for us. I believe the alternative schedule proposed here and the restrictions it imposes on us will make our load-in work for Seattle Center and Northwest Folklife.

 Sincerely,

 Mea Fischelis

 Director of Operations

 VISION STATEMENT

 Seattle Center is the nation's best gathering place. Its roots reach back more than 100 years as a site of Native American celebrations. Today this place is home to major sports teams, top performing arts groups and the city's most recognized attractions. It's the place to be for rock concerts and operas, art fairs, basketball, ballroom dancing and major festivals of the arts and culture that are signature events for Seattle, King County and the entire Pacific Northwest region.

 As an agency of the city, Seattle Center works hard to create environments respectful of each festival's distinctive mission, audience and needs. In order to meet the needs of each festival and to protect this precious site for all users at all times, these site guidelines have been drawn up as a framework around which to plan. They are designed to facilitate teamwork between Seattle Center staff and festival organizers. They convey the spirit of cooperation Seattle Center brings to making major festivals the heart of its outdoor programming.

 I. NORTHWEST FOLKLIFE FESTIVAL OBLIGATIONS

 A. NW Folklife shall employ or otherwise provide all professional staff necessary to ensure production of the Festival at Seattle Center. Such staff shall be employed consistent with the City's union agreements.

 Festival Report

 Facility Use Plan: Each Facility Use Plan shall describe which facilities and areas of Seattle Center are proposed to be used for the Festival and what general activities would take place during the next Festival. NW Folklife shall be permitted to use Center House Conference Rooms G & H, free of any license fee, from the Friday prior to the Festival through completion of the Festival move-out. This usage shall be noted on the facility use plan. Load-in days for the NW Folklife Festival shall occur as per Exhibit A dated Dec. 8, 2000.

 Draft Organizational Budget: Each Draft Organizational Budget shall pertain to Licensee's fiscal year and shall be prepared according to standard accounting practices.

 C. Event Service Order: Licensee shall develop and produce a separate Event Service Order for each Festival. If the Event Service Order submitted by Licensee is not consistent with the Site Guidelines and Facility Addenda, Seattle Center staff shall so notify Licensee and shall negotiate modifications to the Event Service Order to accommodate the needs of the parties and the Event Service Order shall thereafter be revised. Any costs incurred for the production of the revised Event Service Order shall be borne by Licensee.

 1) Each Event Service Order shall describe the complete technical and facility set-up desired in or on the Seattle Center facilities and grounds that have been reserved for use during that year's Festival, including all Seattle Center equipment, services, supplies and material within the specified facilities and available for use at specified "on-grounds areas", as indicated in the Site Guidelines and Facility Addenda, that Licensee desires to use for Festival purposes. Any equipment Licensee wishes to use that is not identified in the Site Guidelines for Major Festivals and the Seattle Center Facility Addenda publication as being generally available from Seattle Center is subject to the Director's approval, which approval shall be granted or denied, in writing, within fifteen (15) City working days after the City's receipt of the draft Event Service Order. No changes in the Final Event Service Order shall occur after May 1, unless due to circumstances beyond Licensee's. Licensee may supplement equipment provided by Seattle Center provide its own labor to set up, move out and operate said equipment provided such activities are consistent with then-current contracts between the City and its labor unions.

 2) Those items of Seattle Center production equipment that the Director approves for Festival use, as described in the approved Event Service Order, shall be provided to Licensee at no cost. If some or all of the requested equipment are or become unavailable for Festival use because of damage, destruction, or malfunction, the Director shall notify Licensee of the unavailability as soon as possible after such unavailability becomes known, and in such event the City shall make a good faith effort but shall not be obligated to furnish replacement items. A list of production equipment available for use during the Festival shall be given to Licensee each December during the term of this Agreement for the following year's Festival. Licensee shall return all Seattle Center equipment on or before the end of the move-out period specified for the facility or grounds area with respect to which such equipment is associated or related. The City shall cooperate with Licensee to install, in a timely manner, all stage and production facilities and equipment needed for the Festival, as determined by Licensee and as approved for such use by the Director. Supplying additional production equipment which is not available for use at Seattle Center generally throughout the year shall be the responsibility of Licensee.

 D. Festival Report: Each Festival Report shall include a complete financial and programmatic evaluation of the immediately preceding Festival, together with sample programs. Detailed recommendations for future efforts toward the planning, organizing, staging, production and evaluation of the Northwest Folklife Festival at Seattle Center also shall be submitted to the Director as part of the Festival Report.

 E. Acceptance of Documents. Except as otherwise provided in this section, if the Director determines that a portion or all of the documents or plans submitted by Licensee hereunder are unacceptable, for any reason, the Director shall notify Licensee of that determination, in writing, within thirty (30) working days after receipt of said document(s). Licensee shall have five (5) City working days to correct any deficiencies identified by the Director. The Director may forfeit a portion or all of the City obligations should the deficiencies not be corrected within this five (5) day period.

 10. INSTALLATION OR INTEGRATION OF ANY WORK OF VISUAL ART ON PREMISES

 a. Reservation of Rights by City; Prohibition Against Installation or Integration of Any Work of Visual Art on Premises Without City's Consent The City reserves to and for itself the right to approve or disapprove of the installation or integration on or in the Premises of any "work of visual art," as that term is defined in the Visual Artists Rights Act of 1990, as now existing or as later amended, and to approve or disapprove of each and every agreement regarding any such installation or integration. The Lessee shall not install on or integrate into, or permit any other person or entity to install on or integrate into, the Premises any such work of visual art without the prior, express, written consent of the Director. The Director's consent to the installation of any such art work may be granted, granted upon one or more conditions, or withheld in the Director's discretion; Provided, however, that the Director's consent to the installation by or for the Lessee of any such art work shall not be required under the following three (3) circumstances:

 (1) If such art work (a) weighs less than fifty (50) pounds; and (b) is of a size and has such dimensions and material composition that makes its passage through an open 32" x 78" or larger doorway a simple and easy maneuver; and (c) is to be installed on the floor, a piece of furniture, or similar surface without further anchoring of any kind or nature, or on a wall using no more than two (2) simple picture hooks and wire; all so that the easy removability from the Premises of such art work without its destruction, distortion, mutilation or other modification by reason of such removal is undeniable; or

 (2) If the Lessee delivers to the Director a waiver appropriately executed by the art work creator, for the benefit of the City and its successors and assigns as the owner of

 the Premises, of the creator's right of integrity regarding such art work, in a form of waiver that satisfies both the Director and the requirements of 17 U.S.C. onstruction106A(e), as the same now exists or is hereafter modified; or

 (3) If the Director executes with the creator of a work of visual art to be installed in the Premises a consent agreement of the type contemplated by 17 U.S.C. onstruction113(d)(1), as the same now exists or is hereafter amended, and in the form and manner specified by the Director.

 (4) In the event the creator of any work of visual art installed in the Premises by or for the Lessee has not executed a waiver, or such creator and the City have not executed a consent agreement, each as described herein, the Lessee shall ensure that, prior to removing or allowing the removal from the Premises of any such art work, such creator is given both notice, as contemplated in 17 U.S.C. onstruction113(d)(2), of the intended removal of such art work, and the time required by that statutory provision to respond to such notice, and that the Lessee takes whatever other action(s) may be required by such legislation to ensure that no claim, action or suit alleging a violation of the Visual Artists Rights Act of 1990, as now existing or hereafter amended, and arising out of any act or omission of or for the Lessee or any of its officers, employees, or agents, is filed or lodged against the City in its capacity as the Premises owner.

 b. Lessee's Indemnification of City Against Liability under Visual Artists Rights Act of 1990

 The Lessee shall protect, defend, and hold the City harmless from and against any and all claims, suits, actions or causes of action, damages and expenses (including attorneys' fees and costs) arising as a consequence of (a) the installation or integration of any work of visual art on or into the Premises; (b) the destruction, distortion, mutilation or other modification of the art work that results by reason of its removal; or (c) any breach of Subsection 10.a. of this Lease; or (d) any violation of the Visual Artists Rights Act of 1990, as now existing or hereafter amended; by the Lessee or any of its officers, employees or agents. This indemnification obligation shall exist regardless of whether the Director or any other person employed by the City has knowledge of such installation, integration, or removal or has consented to any such action or is not required to give prior consent to any such action. The indemnification obligation of this subsection shall survive the expiration or earlier termination of this Lease.

 11. ACCEPTANCE OF PREMISES: Lessee has inspected and examined the physical condition of the Premises and accepts the Premises in their present condition as of the commencement date of the Term hereof. The City disclaims all representations, statements or warranties, expressed or implied, have been made by or on behalf of the City with respect to the condition of the Premises or the use or occupancy authorized other than those contained in this Lease. Any expense incurred in mutually agreed upon alterations, improvements or repairs or new construction necessary for Lessee's use and occupancy shall be borne by Lessee.

 12. POSSESSION: If the City shall be unable for any reason to deliver possession of the Premises, or any portion thereof, at the time of the commencement of the term of this Agreement, City shall not be liable for any damage caused thereby to Lessee, nor shall this Agreement thereby become void or voidable, nor shall the term specified herein be in any way extended, but in such event, Lessee shall not be liable for any rent until such time as City can deliver possession; Provided, that if Lessee shall, in the interim take possession of any portion of Premises, it shall pay as rental the full rental specified herein reduced pro rata for the portion of the Premises not available for possession; And provided further, that if City shall be unable to deliver possession of said Premises, Lessee shall have the option to terminate this Agreement by providing to the City written notice thereof at least thirty (30) days prior to the effective date of termination, unless the

 City shall deliver possession of the Premises prior to the effective date of termination specified in such notice. If Lessee shall, with the City's consent, take possession of all or any part of the Premises prior to the commencement of the term of this Agreement, all of the terms and conditions of this Agreement shall immediately become applicable, with the exception that Lessee shall be obligated to pay a pro-rated rental for the period prior to the commencement of the term of this Agreement or such sum as may otherwise be mutually agreed upon.

 13. CONSTRUCTION, ALTERATIONS, IMPROVEMENTS, AND ADDITIONS: Lessee shall not make any alteration in, or addition or improvement to, the Premises without the prior written consent of City. Any change or alteration made shall be at the expense of Lessee. All alterations to or improvements upon the Premises, or the building of which the Premises form a part, made by either party (except furniture put in at the expense of Lessee, and movable without defacing or injuring the building or Premises) shall become the property of the City and shall remain upon and be surrendered with the Premises as a part thereof at the end of the term, without disturbance, molestation or injury thereof, except as provided herein.

 Lessee's building plans must set forth improvements and equipment of the highest quality and, in all respects, of sound and safe structure, and in accordance with the policies, motifs, designs and overall planning for the Seattle Center and the particular area in which such structure and equipment shall be installed. City shall have the right to approve and/or disapprove Lessee's plans or .portions thereof and Lessee shall not commence construction and/or installation of equipment or improvements until City has approved said plans in writing. Any expenditures in connection with said construction and equipment installation prior to the aforementioned approval of City, will be at the risk and expense of Lessee. Lessee shall remove any such improvements at its own expense at the end of lease term, if so requested by City.

 14. LIABILITY:

 a. Indemnification: The Lessee shall indemnify and hold the City harmless from any and all losses, claims, actions, damages, costs and expenses (including attorneys' fees) suffered by any person or entity by reason of or resulting from any negligent, reckless or intentional act or omission of the Lessee or any of its agents, employees, contractors, or invitees in connection with use or occupancy of the Premises, including trademark, patent, and copyright infringement; and except in connection with or collateral to the demolition, construction, alteration, addition, improvement, repair, or maintenance of the Premises or the moving thereto and therefrom, any concurrent, negligent act or omission of the Lessee or any of its officers, employees, agents, or invitees, and of the City or any of its officers, employees, agents, or invitees. In the event any suit or action is brought against the City, the Lessee, upon notice of the commencement thereof, shall defend the same, at no cost and expense to the City, and promptly satisfy any final judgment adverse to the City or to the City and the Lessee jointly; Provided, that in the event the Director determines that one or more principles of governmental or public law are involved, the City retains the right to participate in such action. Nothing contained in this section shall be construed as requiring the Lessee to indemnify the City against liability for damages arising out of bodily injury to persons or damage to property caused by or resulting from the sole negligence of the City or any of its officers, employees, or agents. Notwithstanding any provision to the contrary herein, in the event any bodily injury or damage to property results from or arises out of any construction, alteration, repair, addition to, subtraction from improvement to, or maintenance of, any excavation, building, structure, project, development or improvement attached to real estate, including moving and demolition in connection therewith, that has been undertaken or performed by or on behalf of the Lessee, the indemnification provided pursuant to this subsection shall be limited to the extent of the negligence of the Lessee and those acting by or for the Lessee.

Insurance coverage in the minimum amounts set forth herein shall not be construed to relieve the Lessee from liability in excess of such coverage.

 (2) Coverage: Coverage shall be provided for liability for any injury, death, damage and/or loss of any sort sustained by any person, organization or corporation (including the Lessee and any of its officers, employees and agents) in connection with or arising out of any act or omission of (a) the Lessee; or (b) any of the Lessee's officers, employees, agents, assigns or invitees; or (c) the Lessee and City or any of their officers, employees, agents, assigns, or invitees, jointly, upon the Premises; and for any activity performed by the Lessee under this Lease and shall include, but need not be limited to the following types (described in insurance industry terminology):

Lessee's Authorization to Use Premises Constitutes Assignment or Sublease: In the event the Lessee in any manner permits anyone to occupy all or any portion of the Premises for any purpose including but not limited to the conduct of any business or other activity, whether or not business-related, not within the intent of this Lease or any sublease, such permission shall be deemed an assignment or sublease, as deemed appropriate by the Director. Every sublease shall require the sublessee to submit to the Director and the Lessee not more than ten (10) days after the end of each month during the term of its sublease and the month after the expiration or earlier termination of such sublease, a written statement identifying the amount of gross receipts generated by such sublessee on and from the portion of the Premises used and occupied by such sublessee during the immediately preceding month. In the event of any assignment of this Lease, the Lessee shall cause to be delivered to the Director simultaneously with such assignment, an instrument, in writing, executed by the assignee, in which the assignee shall assume and agree to perform all of the terms and provisions of this Lease on the Lessee's part to be kept and performed that theretofore have not been fully performed.

 20. DAMAGE OR DESTRUCTION

 a. Report of Damage or Destruction: The Lessee shall submit a written report to the Director, in care of the Contracts and Concessions Office, regarding the circumstances of any damage to the Premises, within twenty-four (24) hours after its discovery.

 b. Rent Obligation in Event of Damage or Destruction: In the event the Premises are destroyed by fire or other casualty not occasioned by an act or omission of the Lessee, or are damaged so extensively as to render the Premises unusable, the Lessee's obligation to pay rent shall be suspended until the Premises are made usable; but in the event only a portion of the

 Premises are damaged or destroyed by fire or other casualty not occasioned by an act or omission of the Lessee and the remainder of the Premises remains usable, the Lessee shall pay only a prorated rent that is proportionate to the extent of the Premises that remains usable for the purposes identified in Sub-section 18.d hereof.

 c. Rebuilding, Repair & Restoration: In the event that insurance proceeds payable to the City will provide sufficient funds to enable the City to rebuild, repair and restore the Premises after their damage or destruction, and neither the Lessee nor the City elects to terminate this Lease pursuant to Subsection B-16.d hereof, the City shall diligently prosecute such rebuilding, repair, and restoration. Upon the rebuilding, repair and reconstruction of the Premises, the Lessee shall immediately re- occupy the Premises and again pay rent and additional rent for the right granted herein to use and occupy such area through the expiration or termination date of this Lease, whichever is earlier.

 d. Termination Rights in Event of Damage or Destruction:

 (2) By City: Notwithstanding any other provision in this Lease to the contrary, in the event that fifty percent (50%) of the Building on which the Premises are located is destroyed or is so damaged by fire or other casualty as to be untenantable or unusable, or if the City desires to discontinue the Lessee's operations because of substantial destruction of the Building or other part of Seattle Center, regardless of whether the Premises are destroyed, damaged, or otherwise, the City may terminate this Lease by providing prior written notice thereof to the Lessee.

 (3) Notice of Termination: Any notice of termination pursuant to this section shall be provided within sixty (60) days after the occurrence of the damage or destruction and shall specify the effective date of such termination.

 (6) The repeated failure to perform or the violation of any single condition or covenant of this Lease on two or more occasions in any twelve (12) month period; or

 b. City's Notice of Default & Breach: The Director shall provide written notice to the Lessee in the event the Lessee commits any act or omission specified in Subsection 19.a hereof, specifying the nature of the act or omission, the reasonable number of days (but not more than sixty (60) days) after the date of the notice within which such failure must be corrected or the violation must be ceased or remedied to avoid termination, and the City's intention to terminate this Lease in the event such act or omission has not been corrected within such stated period.

Remedies: In the event the Lessee fails to correct, remedy, or cease such failure or violation within the time specified in the Director's notice, the City may thereafter terminate this Lease without any further proceedings, re-enter the Premises, lease and license others to use said Premises during any portion of the period of use remaining under this Lease had it not been terminated, and receive rent, additional rent and license fees therefor; Provided, that notwithstanding such termination and re- entry, the Lessee's liability for the rent and additional rent to be paid to the City hereunder shall not be extinguished, and the Lessee shall pay to the City the difference between said rent and additional rent and the sum the City receives for the use of the Premises by one or more other users during the period beginning on the date the Lessee's rights under this Agreement are terminated and ending on the scheduled expiration date of this Lease. Such payment shall be made monthly, within fifteen (15) days after the date of the City's invoice to the Lessee. Such termination and payments shall not relieve the Lessee from liability to the City for any damages caused by the Lessee's default and breach and expenses incurred in the leasing or relicensure of the Premises.

 d. Criteria for Substitute Tenant: The City's obligation to mitigate damages after a default by the Lessee under this Lease that results in the City's regaining possession of all or part of the Premises shall be satisfied in full if the City undertakes to lease the Premises to another tenant (a "Substitute Tenant") in accordance with the following criteria:

 (1) The City shall have no obligation to solicit or entertain negotiations with any other prospective tenants for the Premises until the City obtains full and complete possession of the Premises including, without limitation, the final and unappealable legal right to re-let the Premises free of any claim of the Lessee.

 22. SURRENDER OF PREMISES; HOLDING OVER:

 a.

 d. Hold-over Use & Occupancy of Premises: In the event the Lessee, with the Director's consent, holds over after the date the Term expires or is terminated, whichever is earlier, the resulting use and occupancy shall be on a monthly basis, during which time the Lessee shall be bound by all of the provisions of this Lease other than the amount of the monthly base or adjusted base rent specified in Section 3, which amount shall be the greater of the amount charged for the month immediately preceding the expiration or termination date, whichever is earlier, or the fair market value for the Premises. If, however, the Lessee holds over, without Director's consent, after the expiration or termination date of this Lease, whichever is earlier, whether by failing to remove its personal property or any addition, alteration or improvement specified by the Director, or otherwise, the Lessee shall pay to the City, as liquidated damages, twice the amount of the most recently applicable periodic and percentage rents specified in Sections 3 and 4, hereof, and shall be bound by all of the other provisions of this Lease.

No Claim for Removal: In no event shall the Lessee make any claim or demand upon the City nor shall the City be liable for any inconvenience, annoyance, disturbance, or loss of business or any other damage suffered by the Lessee arising out of removal operations under Subsections 20.b and 20.c hereof.

 f. Inspection Upon Surrender of Premises: Immediately following the vacating of the Premises and the surrender of the same to the City, a representative of the Lessee shall inspect the Premises with the Director to determine the condition of the Premises and whether or not the Lessee is then eligible for the return of the Performance Guarantee provided pursuant to Section 4 hereof, and if not then eligible, what actions must be taken by the Lessee to establish eligibility for the future return of such deposit. The results of such inspection shall be summarized by the Director on a Premises inspection report, a copy of which shall be provided to the Lessee.

 23. NOTICES: All notices from either party to the other shall be in writing and delivered or mailed, postage prepaid, to the intended recipient at the address specified on the signature page hereof, or to such other address as may be specified, from time to time, by either party, by notice to the other party.

 24. NO RELATIONSHIP ESTABLISHED: The City shall in no event be construed to be a partner, associate, or joint venturer of the Lessee, or any party associated with the Lessee.

 26. DEFINITION AND AUTHORITY OF "DIRECTOR: The term "Director," as used throughout this Lease in regard to permission, warrant, consent, approval, rights, interpretation, and discretionary matters, shall mean the Director of the City's Seattle Center Department or such official's functional successor or designee; Provided, that the action of the Director pursuant to or in implementation of this Lease does not constitute any official action by any other City Department or official that may be required by law, ordinance, rule or regulation before the Lessee may rightfully commence, suspend, enlarge, or terminate any particular undertaking or may obtain or exercise any particular right or privilege under this Lease. Any approval, consent or permission required of the Director by this Lease may be granted, conditioned or withheld by the Director in the exercise of such official's sole discretion.

 28. NO WAIVER: Nothing other than a written document signed personally by the Director and specifically declaring a City intent to waive a particular breach or default by the Lessee shall constitute a waiver of such breach or default. No such document shall waive the Lessee's failure to fully comply with any term or condition of this Lease not specifically referenced therein, irrespective of any knowledge any City officer or employee may have of such breach, default, or noncompliance. No waiver by either party shall be construed to be, or operate as, a waiver of any subsequent default in full performance of any provision of this Lease. The payment or acceptance of rent, additional rent, delivery or acceptance of services, or other compensation, whether after a default or from a sublessee or assignee, shall not be deemed to constitute consent to or acceptance of such default or acceptance of defective or incomplete performance in the future or any such subtenancy or assignment.

 29. REMEDIES CUMULATIVE: Rights under this Lease are cumulative; failure to exercise on any occasion any right shall not operate to forfeit such right on another occasion. Each party shall also have any other remedy given by the law. The use of one remedy shall not be taken to exclude or waive the right to use another.

 30. JOINT & SEVERAL LIABILITY: In the event the Lessee is composed of more than one person, entity, or corporation, each of the persons, entities, and corporations composing the Lessee shall be jointly and severally liable under this Lease.

 34. ACKNOWLEDGMENT OF NEGOTIATED LEASE The parties to this Lease acknowledge that it is a negotiated lease, that they have had the opportunity to have this Lease reviewed by their respective legal counsel, and that the terms and conditions of this Lease are not to be construed against any party on the basis of such party's draftsmanship thereof.
