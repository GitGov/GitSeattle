 AN ORDINANCE related to the Boost Program; adding, amending, and repealing various provisions of Ordinance 119602 to finalize design for a pilot small business contracting program, to clarify the process to be used for the program; and making other amendments thereto.

 WHEREAS, the City Council passed Ordinance 119602 authorizing development of a pilot contracting program for small businesses; which has come to be known as the Boost Program; and

 WHEREAS, the Executive Services Department (ESD) worked with Seattle's regional partners to develop a final operating design for the Boost Program pilot that will be utilized throughout the region; maximize resources available for the program; and increase the number of contracts that will be affected by this small business initiative; and

 WHEREAS, the final program design includes a pilot program which applies to public works contracts, and outlines additional ways to apply Boost requirements to those contracts; and

 WHEREAS, the final program design proposes utilizing small businesses primarily from the local region that provide tax revenues, and constitute a significant part of our consortium partners' economic engine, including the Port of Seattle, King County, and the Seattle School District; and

 WHEREAS, the original legislation offered a program concept and required ESD to present a final design in the form of rules to the Council; Now, Therefore,

 BE IT ORDAINED BY THE CITY OF SEATTLE AS FOLLOWS:

 Section 1 of Ordinance 119602 is amended to read as follows:

 Findings. The City Council finds the following:

 1. The success of small economically disadvantaged businesses is important to the region's overall economy, including the development of job opportunities and social mobility in the City.

 2. Economic justice is served by enhancing opportunities for small economically disadvantaged business owners who pursue relevant technical and entrepreneurial training to become more skilled competitors.

 3. Businesses located in King County provide a significant benefit to the economy of the City.

 4. Through its contracting activities, the City is in a position to create important economic incentives to use small economically disadvantaged businesses.

 5. It is in the City's economic interest to provide incentives to encourage small economically disadvantaged businesses to locate and remain within the City.

 Section 2. Section 4 of Ordinance 119602 is amended to read as follows:

 Definitions.

 "Area Economically Benefiting the City" means the area located within King, Snohomish and Pierce Counties.

 "Director" means the Director of the Executive Services Department.

 "Located within" the City or an Area Economically Benefiting the City means that a business at least:

 (a) has its primary offices or distribution points (other than residential or post office box) physically within the relevant boundaries; and

 (b) lists the address on a valid business permit as being within the relevant boundaries; and

 (c) has been doing business within the relevant boundaries for at least 12 months; and

 (d) submits other proof as required by the Director.

 "Small Economically Disadvantaged Business" means that a business and the person or persons who own and control it are in a financial condition which puts the business at a substantial disadvantage in

 attempting to compete for public contracts. In assessing these financial conditions, ESD shall substantially adopt the approach used by the Federal Small Business Administration ("SBA"), provided that the SBA dollar ceilings for various standard business classifications and levels for owners' personal net worth shall be adjusted by the Director to account for local market conditions.

 Section 3. Section 5 of Ordinance 119602 is amended to read as follows:

 Criteria for Participation. To be certified for the Boost Program, a business must be a Small Economically Disadvantaged Business serving a commercially useful function and must meet at least one of the following additional criteria:

 (a) Located within the City of Seattle. A business located within the City, as defined above, may meet this criterion as a means to offset the competitive disadvantages experienced by Small Economically Disadvantaged Businesses and to encourage other such businesses to locate and remain within the City.

 (b) Business Development. A Small Economically Disadvantaged Businesses can meet and maintain this criterion by having the person(s) who owns and controls the business annually complete at least 15 hours of business-related training in a program approved by the Director. In establishing regulations for approval of any such training program, the Director shall look for one or more of the following indications of the program's value: (1) the program's historical use or support from within the relevant industry, (2) any affiliation the program has with established schools, if any, (3) accreditation by an established association.

 (c) Located within an Area Economically Benefiting the City. A Small Economically Disadvantaged Business may meet this criterion by being located within an Area Economically Benefiting the City.

 Section 4. Section 8 of Ordinance 119602 is amended to read as follows:

 Methods of Providing Incentive. The Boost Program shall use one or more methods to create an incentive to promote the use of Boost businesses. This incentive shall be produced either through a bonus system in which the increased participation of Boost businesses is a factor in the award of contracts or a factor in compensation to the contractor, or through a set-aside system under which contractors are required to achieve a specified level of participation by Boost businesses. Where the bonus system is used, the contract shall state the maximum incentive available for Boost participation and the possible methods for making use of the incentive. Where a set-aside system is used, the contract shall state a required minimum utilization. The program may provide additional incentives for Boost businesses meeting two or more of the additional criteria for certification.

 Section 5. ESD shall promulgate rules to implement the "Boost Program" authorized by Ordinance 119602, as amended, in accordance with the requirements of Seattle Municipal Code Ch. 3.02.

 Section 6. Section 11 of Ordinance 119602 is repealed.

 Section 7. ESD shall report to the Housing, Human Services, Education and Civil Rights Committee by no later than November 22, 2000, and annually thereafter on the progress of the BOOST program. The report shall include among other things: the number of certified businesses; the utilization rate of BOOST businesses on public works projects; the demography of businesses utilized; information regarding consultant contracts implementation status; findings of small business limits and recommendations. In addition, ESD shall report potential changes and strategies for improvement; emerging issues and the status of community outreach/reaction.
