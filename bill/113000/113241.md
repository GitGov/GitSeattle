 ORDINANCE ______

 AN ORDINANCE relating to the City Light Department; authorizing the Superintendent or his designee to enter into an agreement with the Bonneville Power Administration allowing for greater reliability of the interconnected transmission system by providing for Bonneville's use of the Sno-King to Bothell 230 KV Transmission Line #2 owned by City Light.

 WHEREAS, City Light and Bonneville have been in discussions for over two years regarding Bonneville's request to upgrade, reconnect and use Seattle's east-side transmission lines to provide for greater reliability on the interconnected transmission system; and

 WHEREAS, Ordinance 119914 authorized the first link in this planned upgrade and reconnection running from Bonneville's Maple Valley substation to Bonneville's Sno-King substation; and

 WHEREAS, an agreement has now been negotiated providing for an additional link in the east-side transmission lines by upgrading and connecting Seattle's 230KV transmission line #2 from Bonneville's Sno-King substation to Seattle's Bothell substation; Now Therefore,

 BE IT ORDAINED BY THE CITY OF SEATTLE AS FOLLOWS:

 Section 1. The Superintendent of the City Light Department, or his designee, is hereby authorized to execute an agreement with the Bonneville Power Administration, substantially in the form of the Contract No. 00TX-10292 attached to this ordinance. The agreement provides for Bonneville's use of City Light's Sno-King to Bothell 230KV line #2. The agreement has a term of thirty-two months, ending no later than June 1, 2003. Bonneville will pay for vegetation removal from the transmission corridor up to a combined total of $500,000 for the Maple Valley to Sno-King and the Sno-King to Bothell segments. The agreement also provides for Bonneville to pay City Light a total of $1.5 million in 32 equal monthly installments of $46,875 for use of the Sno-King to Bothell 230KV line #2.

 Section 2. Any act taken in furtherance of this ordinance prior to its effective date are hereby ratified and confirmed.

 Section 3 This ordinance shall take effect and be in force thirty (30) days from and after its approval by the Mayor, but if not approved and returned by the Mayor within ten (10) days after presentation, it shall take effect as provided by Municipal Code Section 1.04.020.

 ISSUES BRIEF

 Sno-King to Bothell Transmission Line Settlement Agreement

 Date: May 26, 2000

 City Light has negotiated an agreement with BPA, entitled Contract No. 00TX-10292 Settlement Agreement, which is related to the upgrade, reconnection and BPA's use of City Light's Sno-King to Bothell 230 kV #2 transmission line ("SNK-BTH #2") to improve reliability of the interconnected system. The proposed agreement will provide for BPA to compensate City Light to upgrade and reconnect these lines and for BPA's use of the SNK-BTH #2 line for a three year period.

 Background

 * City Light owns two double circuit 230 kV transmission lines on the east side of Lake Washington between BPA's Maple Valley and Sno-King Substations and City Light's Bothell Substation (see attached map). These are known as the Maple Valley to Sno-King ("MV-SNK") and Sno-King to Bothell ("SNK-BTH") transmission lines. City Light has had little need for direct use of these lines for its customers for many years. In 1998, BPA approached City Light about its desire to use these transmission lines to provide greater reliability for the interconnected transmission systems.

 * In June 1998, the parties entered into an agreement to restore one of the circuits of the MV-SNK line (MV-SNK line #1), which is known as the Maple Valley-SnoKing 230 kV Transmission Line Capacity Restoration Agreement (BPAT Contract No. 98TX-10166). This agreement provided for City Light to clear trees along the right- of-way and replace one transmission tower, at BPAT's expense, so that the line could be used by BPAT to support regional reliability. Under that agreement, BPA has already reimbursed City Light for costs of $1.9 million and has agreed to pay all of the remaining costs of approximately $600,000 to complete the work.

 * While the work of the Capacity Restoration Agreement was underway, the parties negotiated a second, longer term agreement with City Light to restore the capacity of the second circuit, MV- SNK #2, and to allow BPAT's use of both MV-SNK line #1 and line #2. The parties signed the Maple Valley to Sno-King Settlement Agreement related to these lines in April 2000 (pursuant to City of Seattle Ordinance 119914), in which BPA agreed to reimburse City Light for up to $500,000 for vegetation management this year and $700,000 per year for the use of the MV-SNK line #1 and line #2 for a three year period.

 * In the Maple Valley to Sno-King Settlement Agreement, approved by City Council in March,2000 for the Maple Valley-Sno-King Line number 1, City Light also agreed to make best efforts to work with BPA to allow a temporary interconnection between the SNK-BTH #2 line, and City Light's Snohomish to Bothell 230 kV #2 line, to further enhance the reliability of the interconnected transmission systems.

 Key Issues

 * City Light's execution of the proposed Settlement Agreement will settle the outstanding issues concerning both parties' obligations to meet established reliability criteria.

 * Some of the new capacity available on City Light's Eastside line circuits as a result of the proposed Settlement Agreement , as well as the preceding agreements, will provide additional reliability to City Light's customers for unlikely, multiple failures of our own and other interconnected transmission systems.

 Recent Developments

 * City Light has recently concluded negotiations with BPA regarding BPA's request to connect the SNK-BTH #2 line to the Snohomish to Bothell #2 230 kV transmission line. The proposed Settlement Agreement (Contract No. 00TX-10292) resolves all outstanding issues related to this interconnection.

 * City Light, BPA, and Public Utility District No. 1 of Snohomish County are currently negotiating three related operating procedures which will describe the specific responsibilities of the parties with respect to maintenance and operation of the for the interconnected facilities in the area.

 Implications for City Light

 * System reliability and power flow studies have indicated a need to restore and maintain the capacity of City Light's Eastside transmission lines to support the reliability of the interconnected system. The Settlement Agreement provides for BPA to compensate City Light for tree trimming and installing jumpers to effect an upgraded interconnection, as well as providing on-going compensation to City Light for continuing use of the facilities through a three year term.

 * BPA has agreed to pay City Light the actual costs of vegetation removal and jumper installation, not to exceed a total of $500,000 between this agreement and the Maple Valley to Sno-King Settlement Agreement. As compensation for the use of the line, BPA has agreed to pay City Light $1,500,000 in 32 monthly installments of $46,875 per month for the term of the agreement.

 Next Steps/Schedule

 * City Light staff have already begun the tree trimming and jumper installation work that is necessary to implement this agreement effective July 1, 2000.

 * BPA's offer of the Settlement Agreement expires July 31, 2000; subject to approval of the proposed ordinance, the Settlement Agreement must be signed prior to that date.

 Key Messages

 * The proposed Settlement Agreement will implement changes that enhance transmission reliability of the interconnected system throughout the Puget Sound Area, including within City Light's service area. Some of the new capacity available on the upgraded and reconfigured circuits will provide additional reliability to City Light's customers for unlikely, multiple failures of our own and other interconnected transmission systems.

 * City Light is reserving the right to use its improved Eastside facilities for its own purposes once both of the Settlement Agreements expire in 2003.
