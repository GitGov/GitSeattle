 ORDINANCE _________________

 AN ORDINANCE related to the disposition of City-owned property in the South Lake Union area; appropriating funds from the Cumulative Reserve Subfund for expenses associated therewith; and directing that future proposed legislation include provisions to reimburse the Cumulative Reserve Subfund from proceeds from said disposition; all by a three- fourths vote of the City Council.

 WHEREAS, redevelopment of City-owned properties in the South Lake Union area to provide a gateway to Seattle is a high priority of the Mayor and Council; and

 WHEREAS, the South Lake Union Neighborhood Plan, adopted by City Council in March 1999, calls for redevelopment of City properties in the Mercer Corridor area; and

 WHEREAS, the City Council passed Resolution 30080 outlining public objectives in redevelopment, and directing the Executive Services Department to issue a Request for Qualifications for the Disposal and Redevelopment of the surplus City-owned properties in the area; and

 WHEREAS, the City Council passed Resolution 30045 authorizing the Director of the Executive Services Department to allocate on a reimbursable basis up to $100,000 from the Cumulative Reserve Subfund as appropriated by Ordinance 119482, for certain preliminary costs associated with the redevelopment of City properties located adjacent to South Lake Union; and

 WHEREAS, in order to proceed with this redevelopment project involving capital improvements, the City must obtain appraisals of the involved parcels, conduct analyses of responses to proposed redevelopment, obtain environmental remediation negotiation guidance, secure legal advice, and begin negotiation with selected development partners; and

 WHEREAS, such appraisals, analysis, legal advice, and negotiation guidance costs are estimated to be $185,000 in 2000; and

 WHEREAS, among the possible development scenarios is the disposition of City property totaling over 200,000 square feet at a potential net financial gain to the City well in excess of the combined appropriations of $285,000, and the City Council desires that all of the items described above be reimbursed from such disposition proceeds; Now Therefore,

 BE IT ORDAINED BY THE CITY OF SEATTLE AS FOLLOWS:

 Section 1. As requested by the Director of the Executive Services Department and recommended by the Mayor, the sum of One Hundred Eighty Five Thousand Dollars ($185,000) is hereby appropriated from the Cumulative Reserve Subfund, Unrestricted Subaccount (00164), for the South Lake Union Redevelopment project (A17075), and the Director of the Executive Services Department is authorized to expend the same.

 Section 2. As part of a proposed legislative package to authorize any sale, trade, or other transaction involving said properties, the Director of the Executive Services Department is directed to include in a proposed ordinance provisions to reimburse total expended Cumulative Reserve Subfund funds to the fullest extent legally allowable, not to exceed Two Hundred Eighty Five Thousand Dollars ($285,000), from net proceeds from any sale, trade, or other transaction from said properties.

 Section 3. The appropriation in Section 1 above is made to meet actual necessary expenditures of The City of Seattle for which no appropriation has been made due to causes which could not have reasonably been foreseen at the time of the adoption of the 2000 budget.

 Section 4. The Council hereby ratifies and confirms prior actions taken by the Executive in carrying out the work supported by this appropriation.

 Section 5. This ordinance shall take effect and be in force thirty (30) days from and after its approval by the Mayor, but if not approved and returned by the Mayor within ten (10) days after presentation, it shall take effect as provided by Municipal Code Section 1.04.020.
