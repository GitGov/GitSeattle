 WOODLAND PARK ZOO OPERATIONS AND MANAGEMENT AGREEMENT December 17, 2001

 This Woodland Park Zoo Operations and Management Agreement (the "Agreement") is made and entered into as of ________________, 2001, by and between the CITY OF SEATTLE, a Washington first class city (the "City"), acting through its DEPARTMENT OF PARKS AND RECREATION (the "Parks Department"), and the WOODLAND PARK ZOOLOGICAL SOCIETY, a Washington non-profit corporation ("WPZS").

 RECITALS

 WHEREAS, the City currently owns public zoological gardens located in the City of Seattle and commonly known as the Woodland Park Zoo (the "Zoo"). The Zoo is located on certain park land owned by City and described in greater detail in Exhibit "A-2" attached hereto; and

 WHEREAS, WPZS is a non-profit public benefit corporation organized in 1965 for charitable, scientific and educational purposes for the study and promotion of zoology and wildlife conservation and for the education and recreation of the public. WPZS currently provides a limited range of services for the City's Parks Department at the Zoo, including educational programs and activities; wildlife and habitat conservation; marketing, management and operation of Zoo food and gift services; and fundraising; and

 WHEREAS, in 1976, the Zoo's first Long-Range Plan (the "1976 Long- Range Plan") was developed as a means of guiding the Zoo's evolution as a state-of-the-art zoo; and

 WHEREAS, since 1976, the Zoo has been a leader in "immersion" exhibit design, beginning with the African Savanna, the Gorilla Exhibit, Primate Islands, North American Marsh and Swamp Exhibits. This naturalistic exhibit design has been used as a model for zoos around the world and has brought the Zoo international prominence and recognition; and

 WHEREAS, in 1980, there was a crisis in the elephant population, leading to the "Save the Elephants" campaign. The "Save the Elephants" campaign led to the creation of Zoo Commission I in 1985, which was charged with evaluating the Zoo's deteriorating exhibits and physical facilities and recommending a method whereby the deficiencies could be addressed. Zoo Commission I was also a large citizen-based effort resulting in the recommendation for a sizable capital development program to rejuvenate the Zoo, financed through a regional, voter-approved taxing measure; and

 WHEREAS, the 1985 King County Zoo Bond Issue provided $31.5 million, and along with private donations in response to the "Save Our Elephants" campaign, WPZS raised an additional $10 million from private donations to match the bond and to build additional elements of the 1976 Long-Range Plan; and

 WHEREAS, the Zoo, which originated as a public park with a small menagerie of animals, is now an exceptional center for wildlife exhibition, education, conservation and scientific research; and

 WHEREAS, the Zoo is currently funded by a combination of public support and private contributions, and through the City and WPZS combined employs approximately 388 full- and part-time staff members, and benefits from the services of nearly 900 volunteers; and

 WHEREAS, WPZS membership and involvement has increased in recent years; and

 WHEREAS, WPZS endeavors to be a creative partner with the City and other local governments in improving and operating the Zoo for the greatest public good; and

 WHEREAS, in 1995, then-Mayor Norm Rice appointed the Zoo Commission II to review Zoo needs and to propose ways to finance the Zoo's operations and continued development into the 21st Century. The Zoo Commission II believed that non-profit management and stable public funding would result in increased private contributions and allow the Zoo to continue to develop and realize its potential for leadership in education and conservation; and

 WHEREAS, in Resolution 29386 adopted on July 1, 1996, the City Council expressed its general support for the recommendations of Zoo Commission II; and

 WHEREAS, the City and WPZS sought changes in state legislation to allow non-profit management of zoos; and

 WHEREAS, in the 2000 state legislative session, Chapter 35.64 of the Revised Code of Washington was passed to authorize certain cities, including the City, to enter into contracts with non- profits or other public organizations for the overall management and operation of a zoo; and

 WHEREAS, the City placed the Neighborhood Parks, Green Spaces, Trails and Zoo levy lid lift on the November 2000 ballot; and

 WHEREAS, in November 2000, the citizens of the City approved the Neighborhood Parks, Green Spaces, Trails and Zoo levy lid lift, which provides increased funding for the City's parks and recreation programs, including the Zoo; and

 WHEREAS, by virtue of its purposes, interests and past successes, WPZS is both experienced and well suited to administer, plan, manage and operate the Zoo through an agreement with the City executed by the Superintendent of the Department of Parks and Recreation; and

 WHEREAS, the City and WPZS believe that this Agreement will provide the greatest opportunity for success of the Zoo in fulfilling its mission in education, conservation of wildlife, recreation, providing benefits to the citizens of Seattle, and developing the Zoo as an important civic asset, cultural resource and attraction; and

 WHEREAS, the Zoo is actively involved in efforts to preserve endangered species through Species Survival Plans, and WPZS intends to continue and enhance such efforts in the future; and

 WHEREAS, this Agreement would continue City ownership of the Zoo property and facilities, consistent with the City Charter, and the City would retain control of the property through the conditions outlined in this Agreement; and

 WHEREAS, two separate studies, the 1988 Gardener study and the 1998 Transpo Study, found that the existing parking lots at the Zoo were inadequate to handle the current and projected Zoo attendance and recommended the addition of up to 1000 new spaces; and

 WHEREAS, the scoping process for the EIS for the 2002 revision to the Zoo's Long-Range Plan identified the impact of zoo visitor parking on the surrounding neighborhoods as the principal issue of the EIS; and

 WHEREAS, over 20 meetings, presentations and workshops and other opportunities for public comment, participation and discussion related to the Long-Range Plan generated over 300 comments from over 100 participants focused on parking alternatives; and

 WHEREAS, the proposed Woodland Park Zoo Long-Range Plan and EIS to be considered and adopted by the City Council in 2002 considered 5 parking garage alternatives; and

 WHEREAS, as set forth in the Board minutes of the January 23, 1996, Board of Directors meeting, the Board of Directors of WPZS has determined, consistent with the recommendations of Zoo Commission II, that it would be in the best interest of the Zoo and its future development if the City were to enter into an agreement with WPZS to provide for the management by WPZS of the entire Zoo operation under the terms and conditions set forth herein;

The Parks Department retains the right to determine the uses of the Woodland Park Rose Garden and the Neighborhood Parks, provided that any change in such uses shall be adopted as part of the Long-Range Plan or by amendment of the Long-Range Plan.

 Additionally, the water standpipe on the western perimeter of the Zoo will continue to be managed pursuant to the legislation establishing the standpipe and authorizing its location on Department of Parks and Recreation Park property.

 3.4.2 No Illegal Uses or Nuisances. WPZS shall not use or occupy any of the Premises, and shall not permit the use or occupancy thereof, in any unlawful manner or for any illegal purpose, and shall not permit to be carried on any activity that would constitute an actionable nuisance under the laws of the State of Washington. WPZS shall take all reasonable precautions to eliminate any nuisances or hazards relating to its activities on or about the Premises, except as to Pre-Existing Conditions.

 4. Existing Third Party Agreements. The Parties specifically acknowledge that there are existing leases, agreements, and arrangements between the City and third parties or between WPZS and third parties. The City shall assign all such existing leases, agreements, and arrangements affecting the Zoo (as identified in Exhibit B to this Agreement) to WPZS and WPZS shall have the exclusive option (if the City had such option) of renewing such leases, agreements, and arrangements that expire during the term of this Agreement and any extensions thereto. WPZS is hereby released from its obligation to make payments due after the effective date of this agreement, under the concession contract dated January 25, 1993, which was approved by City Council Ordinance number 116574.

 5. Maintenance and Operations.

 5.1 WPZS Responsibility. WPZS shall manage and operate the Zoo as a state-of-the art zoo, consistent with the Long-Range Plan, with emphasis on the Zoo's scientific and educational purposes and programs.

 5.2 City Operations Support Payments.

 5.2.1 Fee and Escalation. Subject to Section 5.2.2 below, the City shall transfer to WPZS an annual operations payment (the "Operations Support") equal to FIVE MILLION DOLLARS ($5,000,000.00) in the first Fiscal Year of this Agreement. For each year thereafter, the Operations Support shall be escalated by seventy (70) percent of the increase in the Consumer Price Index for Urban Wage Earners and Clerical Workers for the Seattle-Tacoma-Bremerton area, or its functional successor, measured as of June 30 of the prior year. The Operations Support shall be paid to WPZS in twelve equal monthly installments on or before the fifteenth (15th) day of each month. In the event that the Effective Date is not the first day of a Fiscal Year, the first year's Operations Support shall be reduced pro rata. Operations Support in all subsequent years shall be calculated as if the first year's payment had been the full annual amount.

 5.2.2 Fund Appropriation; Fiscal Emergency. The City intends to fund the payment of the Operations Support in each Fiscal Year from a General Fund appropriation. The payment of the Operations Support in any Fiscal Year shall also be governed by and subject to the following fiscal emergency provisions. For purposes of this Agreement, a "fiscal emergency" shall arise when total City General Fund revenue for a year is reasonably projected in the adopted budget to be less than the revenue projected, at the time of adoption of the budget for that next year, to be received in the previous year (the year during which the budget for the next year is adopted). In the event of a fiscal emergency, the Operations Support can be reduced from the amount provided the previous year by up to the percentage decline in expected General Fund revenue or by 5%, whichever is less. In subsequent years when the fiscal emergency criterion no longer applies, the Operations Support shall  be adjusted annually from the prior year's amount using the escalation factor defined in Section 5.2.1. If the amount provided is reduced due to a fiscal emergency, WPZS's match requirement as set forth in section 5.4.1 shall be reduced by an equal dollar amount for the year and in each subsequent year until the General Fund transfer reaches the amount provided prior to the fiscal emergency. The following example indicates how this provision is intended to apply. If the Operations Support in Year X is $6,000,000, and the Adopted Budget for Year X+1 shows a fiscal emergency with a General Fund revenue decline of 2% between Year X and Year X+1, the Operations Support for Year X+1 can be reduced by a maximum of 2%, producing a total of $5,880,000. If the Adopted Budget for Year X+2 shows that the fiscal emergency condition no longer applies because General Fund revenues are projected to grow between Year X+1 and Year X+2, the escalation factor for Year X+2 applies to the $5,880,000. If the annual change in the appropriate Consumer Price Index as of June 30 in Year X+1 was 4%, the escalation factor for Year X+2 would be 70% of 4%, or 2.8%. Thus, the Operations Support for Year X+2 would be 2.8% more than provided in Year X+1, or $6,044,640.

 5.2.3 Grant Funding. The City shall allow WPZS to apply for grants in its name for which the Society might not otherwise be eligible subject to prior approval by the Superintendent of Parks or if the Superintendent instructs, the City Council. The City Council retains the right to accept or not accept grant funds so applied for. All grants to the City received for the Zoo shall be transferred to WPZS within thirty (30) days of the receipt of the grant funds, if permitted by the terms of the grant.

 5.3 City Routine Maintenance Payments.

 5.3.1 Payment Schedule. The City shall transfer to WPZS a Routine Maintenance Payment equivalent to FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS ($500,000) of support on an annual basis, to be paid as follows:

 Fiscal Year of Agreement In-Kind Services Cash Payment First $500,000 $0 Second $400,000 $100,000 Third $300,000 $200,000 Fourth $200,000 $300,000 Fifth $100,000 $400,000 Each Year Thereafter $0 $500,000

 Such required cash payments shall be due in quarterly installments to be paid on February 15, May 15, August 15, and November 15 of each year.

 5.3.2 In-Kind Maintenance. In-Kind Maintenance shall include City labor, materials, and indirect maintenance services in substantially the same manner of maintenance support that is currently provided by the City to the Zoo. The City shall document the actual and direct labor hours and any materials provided as a part of the In-Kind Maintenance and submit such documentation to WPZS on a monthly basis.

 5.4 City Major Maintenance Payment.

 5.4.1 Payment Schedule. To address the existing major maintenance backlog at the Zoo and planned 2002 major maintenance projects, the City shall transfer to WPZS a total of SIX MILLION FOUR HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS ($6,400,000) over the first seven years of this Agreement, pursuant to the following schedule:

 Fiscal Year of Agreement Amount First $200,000 Second $1,000,000 Third $1,000,000 Fourth $1,000,000 Fifth $1,000,000 Sixth $1,000,000 Seventh $1,200,000

 The Major Maintenance Payment shall be transferred to WPZS on May 15 of each year. WPZS will provide documentation to the City showing, to the reasonable satisfaction of the Superintendent, that these funds were expended solely on backlog major maintenance projects and consistent with any legal constraints on their use. Payments for major maintenance by the City will be matched by WPZS fundraising. The City will provide $1.00 of major maintenance funding for each $2.50 raised by WPZS, up to the maximum limits in the schedule above. If WPZS does not raise sufficient funds to meet the total matching requirement in any Fiscal Year, City funding for major maintenance will be reduced proportionately for the following year.

 5.4.2 City Financing of Major Maintenance Projects. The City agrees to consider financing major maintenance projects subject to Section 7 below.

 6. Levy Proceeds.

 6.1 Generally. The City shall provide all of the proceeds from the Zoo portion of the Levy to WPZS to expand operations, maintenance, and programming at the Zoo.

 6.2 Payment Schedule. Throughout the term of the Levy, the City shall transfer TWO MILLION FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS ($2,500,000), or as much of that total as is actually received, to WPZS on an annual basis. Such payment shall be due in quarterly installments on February 15, May 15, August 15, and November 15, based on Levy receipts in the previous calendar quarter. Annual amounts shall be escalated as set forth in the Levy, but the actual amounts transferred shall never exceed the amounts actually received by the City.

 6.3 Levy Renewal. At least one year prior to expiration of the Levy, the City shall provide WPZS with notice indicating whether or not the City plans to commence the process for requesting voter approval of a renewal term for at least the Zoo portion of the Levy, on substantially the same terms and amounts as the original Levy. In the event that the City chooses not to request such voter approval, or the levy is not approved by the voters and the City does not provide for a replacement funding source of comparable magnitude, WPZS shall have the option of terminating this Agreement.

 7. City Financing. If requested by WPZS, the City will consider issuing debt for capital purposes at the Zoo. Funding for debt service on such debt, other than debt issued for the Parking Garage described in Section 8, shall be the responsibility of WPZS. In the event WPZS fails to provide funds to pay debt service in a timely fashion, the City will pay such debt service from its own funds and will reduce its payments under Section 5.2 by a corresponding amount.

 8. Parking Garage.

 8.1 Study. The City and WPZS shall conduct a study to address traffic and parking issues raised in the EIS for the Long-Range Plan. The study will be paid for by WPZS using funds provided in the Agreement or other WPZS funds. The study will examine issues including the size of a parking structure or structures on the Zoo property, possible locations, estimated costs, possible ancillary uses, and expected Net Parking Revenue.

 8.2 City Finance Responsibility. If a Parking Garage is identified in the Long-Range Plan adopted by the City, the City shall finance the Parking Garage. Such financing shall be authorized as soon as practicable after adoption of such Long-Range Plan. In the event such adopted Long-Range Plan identifies a garage and such financing has not been authorized by September 1, 2004, the WPZS may terminate this agreement. This date will allow construction of the garage to commence by December 31, 2004.

 8.3 Debt Service. The debt service for the Parking Garage shall be paid from the following sources:

 8.3.1 Net Parking Revenue. WPZS shall provide to the City the yearly Net Parking Revenue toward the debt service on the Parking Garage.

 8.3.2 Remaining Share. After the Net Parking Revenue is deducted from the yearly debt-service payment as required by subsection 8.3.1 above, the remaining debt service payment shall be split between the City and WPZS, with the City paying three- fourths (3/4) of the balance and WPZS paying one-fourth (1/4) of the balance. WPZS shall communicate its actual Net Parking Revenue for six-month periods ending June 30 and December 31 of each year within 45 days after each date. The City will then invoice WPZS for this amount plus WPZS's 25% share of the remaining debt service on the Parking Garage. The City will invoice the WPZS in order to ensure timely payment of debt service on the City's bonds. If WPZS fails to pay the invoiced amount within 45 days after the date of the invoice, the City will pay such amount for debt service from its own funds and will reduce its payments under Section 5.2 by a corresponding amount. Timely payment by WPZS is a central and material term of this Agreement. Notwithstanding the City's reduction of payments under Section 5.2 of this agreement, if WPZS two times within any five-year period fails to pay the invoiced amount within 45 days after the date of the invoice, that shall constitute a default and shall be grounds for the City to terminate this Agreement without the need to provide any period after the due date of the WPZS's debt service payment for WPZS to cure its default.

 8.4 Design and Construction. WPZS shall be responsible for design and construction of the Parking Garage consistent with Section 13 below.

 8.5 Parking Operation. WPZS shall be solely responsible for operating the Parking Garage. Operations responsibility shall include maintaining the Parking Garage consistent with Section 17 below. WPZS will implement policies and incentives to encourage Zoo visitors to use such a garage. WPZS shall have exclusive control over applicable rates for using the Parking Garage. WPZS agrees to set parking rates to encourage short-term parking and carpooling and to ensure that parking revenues provide the maximum feasible share of debt service on the Parking Garage. The City reserves the right to change any terms of this section 8.5 if and only to the extent that such changes are required, in the opinion of legal counsel to the City, to provide or maintain the tax-exempt status of bonds issued for the Parking Garage.

 8.6 Restricted Parking Zone. The City shall not institute a Restricted Parking Zone or other preferential parking for residents in the area within four blocks of the Zoo boundaries until the earlier of December 31, 2004 or completion of structured parking called for in an adopted Long- Range Plan. In the event that WPZS successfully promotes establishment of an RPZ within four blocks of the Zoo following completion of any such garage, WPZS will pay for one permit fee per household within any such RPZ for an initial two-year period.

 8.7 Alternative Transportation. To help relieve overflow parking in the neighborhood, WPZS will continue to develop an alternative transportation plan in conjunction with King County Metro and the City's policy office. The plan will provide incentives for improved transit, bicycle and pedestrian access, as well as bicycle corrals and transit options for major events. Improved transit, bicycle and pedestrian access will be built into all parking improvements. WPZS will also develop an employee trip reduction plan, dedicated employee carpool spaces, and explore extending transit pass subsidies to all Zoo staff, adding a flexcar and participation in the guaranteed ride home program.

 8.8 Apprenticeship Program. WPZS and its prime contractor(s) will establish a target that fifteen percent (15%) of estimated hours of construction work on the Parking Garage will be assigned to apprentices. WPZS has stated its intention that at least ten percent (10%) of the value of the construction work on the Parking Garage be subcontracted to women or minority-owned business enterprises.

 9. Long-Range Plan.

 The Parties acknowledge that this Agreement contemplates the adoption by the City of the Long-Range Plan, as deemed acceptable by WPZS, on or before April 1, 2002. In the event that such a Plan is not adopted by April 1, 2002, WPZS may terminate this Agreement.

 10. Permits, Licensing and Accreditation.

 10.1 Required Permits, Licenses and Accreditation. Throughout the Term (including any extensions thereof), WPZS shall cause both itself and the Zoo to be at all times (a) accredited by the AZA; (b) licensed with the United States Department of Agriculture; and (c) licensed by the Seattle-King County Health Department. Any failure on the part of WPZS to comply with this Section shall constitute a material breach of this Agreement.

 10.2 Other Licenses and Permits. As part of the transition plan described in Section 3.3, the City and WPZS will develop a list of all licenses and permits currently held by the City in connection with the operation of the Zoo. Subject to any necessary approvals, the City hereby agrees to transfer all such licenses and permits to WPZS, and WPZS and the City shall use their best efforts to either have those licenses and permits legally transferred to WPZS or to have them canceled upon WPZS's obtaining replacement permits or licenses in its name if transfer is not possible except that certain licenses and permits shall remain in the possession of the City and under the City's name, and WPZS shall hereby be authorized as the agent of the City to perform such services under such licenses and permits as are required in the operation of the Zoo to the extent permitted by applicable law, if such licenses or permits are required to be held by a governmental entity and/or owner of the Premises or for such other reasons as may be agreed to by the parties. Upon any termination of this Agreement for any reason, WPZS shall transfer all licenses and permits back to the City and WPZS shall use its best efforts to assist the City with the documentation of any such transfer or reapplication for any such permit or license to be held in City's name after such termination.

 11. New Facilities Operating and Maintenance Costs. As WPZS funds and builds new exhibits, support and visitor facilities, the corresponding increases in operating, program and maintenance costs will be the responsibility of WPZS, with the City being the owner of such new exhibits, support or visitor facilities (including the Parking Garage).

 12. Admissions.

 12.1 WPZS Responsibility. Subject to 12.2 and 12.3 below, WPZS shall have the authority to set Zoo admissions charges; provided that, the City and WPZS intend that the Zoo remain accessible to individuals from all economic circumstances. In general, admissions prices should reflect market rates for comparable attractions in Seattle and elsewhere and not increase by more than the rate of inflation being experienced by the Zoo (which includes, but is not limited to, costs such as personnel, supplies, equipment, and utilities). Prior City Council approval shall be required for increases in admission charges greater than such standard. WPZS shall retain all admission proceeds, including gate receipts, and expend such proceeds consistent with the Zoo's operation and programming.

 12.2 Access. WPZS agrees to operate the Zoo with the goal of providing the widest possible access to the Zoo to the general public, at an affordable cost. In furtherance of that goal, WPZS agrees to at a minimum maintain the practice of providing substantially reduced admission to the Zoo for school groups, making available at least 40,000 free passes annually to human services agencies and to pursue other options for ease of access to the Zoo and special services at the Zoo for children, seniors, the disabled and low-income individuals.

 12.3 Admissions Tax. The Parties acknowledge that no City admission taxes are currently charged on Zoo admission. The Parties further agree that the Zoo will continue to be exempt from City admission taxes, so long as similar facilities (such as the Seattle Aquarium and Pacific Science Center) are exempt from such taxes.

 13. Capital Improvements and Alterations.

 13.1 Improvements and Alterations, Generally. Subject to Section 13.3 below, the public participation terms in Section 20.6 of this agreement below, and the requirements of the Code, WPZS may make such capital improvements and alterations to the Premises and the Zoo facilities as WPZS shall determine in its reasonable discretion are necessary to operate the Zoo, all in accordance with the Long-Range Plan. Any alterations or capital improvements made by WPZS to or on the Premises shall comply with any and all applicable local, state and federal laws, rules and regulations, and WPZS shall obtain any required permits for such alterations and capital improvements, at its expense.

 13.2 Alternative Public Works Contracting Authority.

WPZS shall not under any condition (a) make any capital improvement or alteration to the Property or the Zoo facilities inconsistent with the Long-Range Plan; or (b) make any capital improvement or alteration to the Property or the Zoo facilities that is subject to the approval of a City department, commission or agency, when such approval has not been obtained.

 13.4 Title to Improvements. Except as otherwise provided in this Agreement, all appurtenances, fixtures, improvements, equipment, additions and other property attached to or installed in the Premises during the Term shall be and remain the property of City and shall not be removed by WPZS without approval of the Superintendent.

 13.5 WPZS's Personal Property. All furniture, furnishings and articles of movable personal property installed in the Premises by or for the account of WPZS, without expense to City, and which can be removed without structural or other material damage to the Premises (all of which are herein called "WPZS's Property") shall be and remain the property of WPZS and may be removed by it subject to the provisions of Section 25. At least ten (10) days prior to delinquency, WPZS shall pay all taxes levied or assessed upon WPZS's Property and shall deliver satisfactory evidence of such payment to City.

 14. Utilities and Services.

 14.1 Municipal Conservation Fund. The City agrees that the Zoo should have access to the Municipal Conservation Fund (or its substantive equivalent or successor) for conservation-related utility improvements.

 15. Zoo Animals.

 15.1 Rights to Animals. All Zoo animals currently owned by the City and all rights to animals acquired during the term of this Agreement (collectively, the "Zoo Animals"), shall be the sole property of WPZS, which shall also assume all obligations the City may have with respect to animals exhibited, housed, or otherwise kept or cared for at the Zoo during the term of this Agreement. The Zoo Animals shall become the property of the City when this Agreement is terminated. The Zoo Animals shall constitute Personal Property under this Agreement, but where the general terms of this Agreement relating to Personal Property conflict with this Section 15, the provisions of this Section 15 shall govern to the extent of the conflict.

 15.2 Care of Animals. WPZS shall care for all Zoo Animals in accordance with all federal, state and local laws and regulations, and in accordance with the Long-Range Plan and policies and guidelines adopted by the AZA.

 15.3 Sale and Purchase of Animals. WPZS shall have the authority to acquire or sell or otherwise dispose of Zoo Animals in the course of WPZS's operation of the Zoo. The acquisition, sale or other disposition of Zoo Animals shall be made in strict accordance with (a) all applicable federal, state or local laws, regulations and policies, (b) the guidelines and policies of the AZA, and (c) existing and any adopted acquisition and disposition policies approved by the City.

 16. Naming Rights.

 16.1 Zoo Name. Under no circumstances, with the exception of formal action by the Board of Parks Commissioners and the City Council, may the Zoo's name be changed from "Woodland Park Zoo."

 16.2 Donation Acknowledgement. Any donor recognition at the Zoo will be consistent with the Parks Department's naming policy for Zoo facilities, as those policies may be amended from time to time by the Superintendent. The Superintendent shall consult with WPZS prior to making any changes to the Zoo facility naming policy.

 17. Maintenance.

 17.1 Generally. WPZS shall maintain the Zoo in a clean, safe, sanitary and sightly condition, and as necessary to maintain all licenses and accreditations in accordance with Section 10 above; provided, however, that such obligation shall not, except as specifically set forth herein, require WPZS to repair or otherwise remedy a Pre-Existing Condition. WPZS shall employ sufficient personnel, or show evidence satisfactory to the City of personal service contracts which provide such personnel, to perform the maintenance and repair work in a prompt and efficient manner in order to keep the Zoo premises at all times in an operating condition that is clean, safe and attractive.

 17.2 Contractor Insurance. Each party hereto shall provide evidence acceptable to the other that every contractor engaged by a party to perform work on the Premises maintain insurance in amounts, on policies of coverage and offered by companies satisfactory to City and WPZS, including but not limited to Worker's Compensation Insurance (including Employers' Liability Insurance) and insurance against liability for injury to persons and property arising out of all such contractor's operations, and the use of owned, non-owned or hired automotive equipment in the pursuit of all such operations.

 18. Staffing and Employees

 18.1 Generally. The Parties acknowledge that as of the date of this Agreement, there are approximately 170 City Employees employed in connection with the Zoo. The Parties' intent is that the City Employees will be given the choice of electing Zoo-related employment with WPZS or other employment within the City in so far as is practical and allowable under City rules, state, federal and local laws and collective bargaining agreements.

 18.2 WPZS Supervision of Employees. Pursuant to RCW 35.64.010(4) and commencing ten (10) calendar days after WPZS first names a Zoo Director, WPZS shall, in carrying out the responsibilities under this Agreement, manage, supervise, and direct those employees of the City who are employed at the Zoo and may hire, fire, and otherwise discipline the City Employees subject to the provisions of the City Charter, City Municipal Code, City rules, state legislation and any applicable collective bargaining agreements. The Zoo Director shall be the ultimate appointing authority as provided for by City Charter and by City Ordinance. WPZS shall, in cooperation with the Personnel Director and the Superintendent, develop procedures for implementing this authority with regard to City Employees.

 18.3 Employees. WPZS shall comply with all applicable federal, state and local laws, ordinances and regulations pertaining to all employees at the Zoo. In addition, the WPZS shall be an equal opportunity employer and make reasonable efforts to maintain a diverse work force.

 18.4 Employee Transition Plan. WPZS and the Parks Department will develop and propose an Employee Transition Plan and present it to the City Council by December 31, 2002. The proposed Employee Transition Plan will be accompanied by one or more proposed ordinances to implementing elements of the Employee Transition Plan that require such City Council action and to amending this Agreement accordingly. Although City Employees may voluntarily resign City employment and be hired by WPZS, no City position existing in the "Zoo Program" in the City's Adopted Budget as of the Effective Date of this Agreement will be eliminated nor an employee involuntarily transferred to WPZS from these positions unless the change is adopted by the City Council by ordinance(s) described above.

 18.4.1 City Employees Not Subject to Collective Bargaining Agreements. The Employee Transition Plan may contain provisions for the following elements of employee transition for those employees not covered by City-negotiated collective bargaining agreements: 1) beginning and end dates for employees to elect transition to employment by WPZS; 2) the recognition and transfer of benefits such as retirement reserves, sick leave and vacation leave balances and employee status as might be offered under such transition; 3) the provisions for the City to "sunset" former Zoo jobs in the event that employees transition from City employment to WPZS employment; 4) provisions for employees to transition to other City jobs if the Employee Transition Plan calls for an absolute transition date for all employees; 5) a definition of the means by which WPZS shall direct and supervise the transitioned workforce to provide a high degree of courteous and efficient service to the public; and 6) such other provisions as the City and WPZS may deem appropriate.

 18.4.2 City Employees Subject To Collective Bargaining Agreements. The City has previously negotiated collective bargaining agreements with collective bargaining representatives representing certain City employees, and currently anticipates executing three-year labor contracts to be effective through 2004 covering these same bargaining units by December 31, 2001. The Parties recognize that the terms of these collective bargaining agreements are binding on the City unless altered by mutual agreement between the City and the collective bargaining agents and consistent with all applicable state, federal and local laws. WPZS agrees to supervise such employees consistent with those agreements. It is the intention of the Parties, subject to the Employee Transition Plan, that City employment positions at the Zoo subject to collective bargaining agreements shall become WPZS positions when: a) the position can remain a represented position under a collective bargaining agreement between WPZS and the union which represented such position under City employment; and b) WPZS can demonstrate that WPZS can offer employee benefits (including retirement benefits) that are comparable to City benefits.

 18.5 City Payment of Certain Benefits. It is the City's intention that the Employee Transition Plan shall have provisions for the carryover of certain benefits for those employees who move from City to Zoo employment. The Employee Transition Plan shall include the following financial elements:

 18.5.1 Vacation. For employees who transition from City to WPZS employment, the City shall calculate the vacation balances for all employees who transfer to Zoo Society employment, pursuant to the Employee Transition Plan and pay the WPZS for carried over vacation leave that WPZS credits to those employees. The City shall provide WPZS with full funding for all vacation hours balances credited to Transferred Employees at their current rates of pay. The City shall pay the WPZS in eight equal quarterly payments beginning with the end of the first quarter wherein the employees transfer to WPZS employment such that the liability for vacation will be paid out to the WPZS over a two- year period.

 18.5.2 Sick Leave The Parties agree that WPZS will credit employees with carried over sick leave when they transition from City employment to WPZS employment. The City shall pay WPZS half of the value of the unused sick leave for Transferred Employees in equal annual installments over 5 years (10% per year).

 18.5.3 Pension. The Employee Transition Plan shall address the means and the financial transactions for recognizing City Employee pension benefits. The Parties intend that City Employees who transition to employment with WPZS shall be credited by WPZS with their full retirement benefits they earned with the City. The Parties further intend that the City will pay to WPZS the present actuarial value of each employee's retirement benefit upon transition so that WPZS can offer roughly equivalent retirement benefits to transitioning employees. The funding for those benefits and City funding source(s) used to make that payment should be based on the value that most closely balances the objectives of making the transition neutral for City employees and neutral to the City's retirement system.

 18.6 Payroll and Taxation.

 18.6.1 City Payroll Until Transition. Until each City Employee leaves City employment, either to transition to WPZS employment or otherwise, that employee will remain on the City payroll for the continued provision of City compensation and benefits, employee status and payment of taxes and reporting, although the Zoo Director will supervise them.

 18.6.2 WPZS Payroll After Transition. After each City Employee who chooses to transition to employment with WPZS does so, WPZS shall make or cause to be made all necessary payroll deductions for disability and unemployment insurance, social security, withholding taxes and other applicable taxes, and prepare, maintain and file or cause to be filed all necessary reports with respect to such taxes or deductions, and all other necessary statements and reports.

 19. Fiscal Matters.

 19.2 WPZS Revenue. All revenue collected by WPZS associated with the Zoo, including without limitation fees and receipts from admission, concessions, souvenirs and other services offered by WPZS to the public at or in association with the Zoo, and all contributions collected by WPZS from any other source, shall be expended or invested by WPZS exclusively for Zoo Purposes.

 19.3 Miscellaneous Fees and Prices. Subject to Section 12 of this Agreement, WPZS shall have the authority to set the amount of all prices and fees for admissions, services rendered or sales made to the public or otherwise at the Zoo, including without limitation, food and drink concessions, membership passes, souvenirs, parking, special exhibits and other special events.

 19.4 Franchises or Concessions. WPZS shall have exclusive authority to grant to any non-profit corporation or public or private organization franchises or concessions that further the public use and enjoyment of the Zoo.

 19.5 Solicitation of Private and Public Funding. WPZS shall (a) use its best efforts to (i) actively solicit private support for WPZS through membership fees and charitable contributions and (ii) actively solicit federal, state or local grants or other funds to support the operation and purposes of the Zoo; and (b) apply all funds contributed to it as membership fees, charitable donations, public grants or loans, or any other sources, to the Operating Expenses, capital improvements at the Zoo and other Zoo Purposes in accordance with this Agreement, and to the administrative and operating expenses of WPZS. The City hereby agrees to use its reasonable efforts to assist WPZS in the solicitation of federal, state and county grants or other sources of public funding to support the operation of the Zoo.

 19.6 Prior Contracts Between WPZS and the City. This Agreement supercedes all prior contracts and reimbursement arrangements between WPZS and the City.

For each capital project, the Superintendent and WPZS will develop such a process for public involvement that is consistent with the Parks Department's Public Involvement Policy. In addition, the WPZS Public Affairs Committee can recommend to the Board of Directors as a whole that a public involvement process be held for other major activities at the Zoo. Such recommendation shall be subject to a vote of the Board of Directors.

 20.6.4 Neighborhood Liaison. The City and WPZS agree that there are and will continue to be unique concerns for the immediate neighbors of the Zoo. WPZS agrees to designate a neighborhood liaison from both the WPZS Board and the WPZS staff to communicate with the Phinney Ridge, Wallingford, Fremont, and Greenlake communities on a regular basis. WPZS, in consultation with such neighborhoods, will develop protocols for communicating with such neighborhoods and for conveying citizen concerns and opinions to the WPZS Board for consideration and response. Such protocols will be developed by the end of the first quarter of 2002.

Either party shall have the option of terminating this Agreement in the event the parties are unable to satisfactorily resolve any Pre-Existing Condition.

If WPZS intends to contest or to fail to pay when due any tax or fee referred to in the preceding sentence, WPZS shall provide the City with at least 30 days notice of that intention before the tax is due, explaining its reasons.

 WOODLAND PARK ZOO OPERATIONS AND MANAGEMENT AGREEMENT

 INSURANCE PROVISIONS

 A. Liability Insurance. WPZS, at no expense to the City, shall obtain and maintain continuously, throughout the Term of this Agreement, policies of insurance as enumerated below. Said policy(ies): (i) shall be subject to approval by the City's Risk Manager as to company, form and coverage, and primary to all other insurance the City may secure; and (ii) must protect the City from any and all claims and risks in connection with any activity performed by WPZS, or any of its respective officers, employees, agents, contractors or assigns, by virtue of this Agreement or any use and occupancy of the Premises authorized by this Agreement. Additionally, WPZS shall file with the City's Risk Manager, within twenty days of the Effective Date of this Agreement (and twenty days prior to any policy renewal), evidence of the policies required to be maintained by this Agreement.

 1. A policy of Commercial General Liability Insurance, written on an insurance industry standard occurrence form (CG 00 01) or equivalent including all the usual coverages known as:

 a. Premises/Operations Liability b. Products/Completed Operations c. Personal/Advertising Injury d. Contractual Liability e. Owners and Contractors Protective Liability f. Stop Gap or Employers Contingent Liability g. Host Liquor Liability h. Employees as Additional Insured

 Such policy(ies) shall provide the following minimum limit:

 1. Bodily Injury and Property Damage: (a) 2,000,000 per occurrence (b) 5,000,000 annual aggregate

 The minimum limits on these policies will be adjusted periodically by the City so that the limits generally reflect the values of the policies as of the date this agreement is signed.

 Deductibles or self-insured retentions of no more than One Hundred Thousand Dollars ($100,000.00) for property damage and/or bodily injury are acceptable.

 2. A policy of Business Automobile Liability Insurance, including coverage for any owned, non-owned, leased or hired vehicles written on an insurance industry standard form (CA 00 01) or equivalent. The following coverage extension shall also be included: Pollution Liability - Broadened Coverage for Covered Autos (CA 99 48), (MCS90) or equivalent.

 Such policy or policies must provide the following minimum limit:

 - Bodily Injury and Property Damage $1,000,000 per accident

 The insurance required in this section A shall be endorsed to include the City of Seattle, its officers, elected officials, employees, agents and volunteers as additional insureds if this can be done at little or no cost to WPZS, and shall not be reduced or canceled without sixty (60) days prior written notice to the City. If the cost of naming the City as an additional insured is substantial, the City may pay such cost. In addition, WPZS's insurance shall be primary as respects the City, and any other insurance maintained by the City shall be excess of and not contributing insurance with WPZS's insurance.

 WPZS shall provide for the prompt and efficient handling of all claims for bodily injury, property damage or theft arising out of the activities of WPZS under this Agreement. WPZS shall ensure that all such claims, whether processed by WPZS or WPZS' insurers, either directly or by means of an agent, will be handled by a person with a permanent office in the Seattle area.

 B. Property Insurance.

 The City currently maintains property insurance on a citywide basis for its facilities, including facilities on the Premises. Throughout the Term of this Agreement, the City shall maintain such property insurance (and be responsible for all premiums for such insurance) on City facilities, including Zoo facilities, as the City determines is fiscally responsible to maintain. The City will not determine what property insurance to maintain on Zoo facilities separately, but only as part of its overall determination as to the appropriate level of property insurance for City facilities citywide. Because the City's property insurance is a "scheduled" policy rather than a "blanket" policy, the parties shall review and concur on scheduled values for Zoo facilities on an annual basis prior to renewal of the City policy. Any property insurance maintained by the City shall, with respect to Zoo facilities, be endorsed to include WPZS as an additional insured, if this can be done at little or no cost to the City. If the cost of doing so is substantial, the WPZS may pay such cost. In addition, the City's insurance shall be primary as respects the WPZS, and any other insurance maintained by the WPZS shall be excess of and not contributing insurance with the City's insurance.

 WPZS will be responsible for paying all deductibles, self-insured retention or other insurance shortfall up to $500,000 for any individual Zoo facility, and $2,000,000 in the aggregate in any policy period for damage to multiple Zoo facilities as required by the property insurance acquired by the City. If available under the City's property insurance policies, WPZS shall have the right to pay the incrementally increased premiums associated with lowering the deductibles on such Zoo facilities and to such levels as WPZS deems reasonable. In the event that the City determines, consistent with the City's obligation herein to maintain insurance on Zoo facilities comparable to any property insurance it maintains for City facilities city-wide, that it is financially responsible to have deductibles or self-insured retention levels that in the aggregate exceed $500,000 for any single Zoo facility, or to otherwise insure individual Zoo facilities at levels where the replacement cost of the Zoo facility exceeds the amount of insurance coverage on an individual Zoo facility by more than $500,000, the City shall give notice of such determination (the "Insurance Notice") to WPZS. Until such time as the City gives WPZS the Insurance Notice, in the event of damage to a Zoo facility, the damage of which is covered by the City's property insurance, the City will be responsible for the payment of any deductible, self-insured retention, or other shortfall in the amount of insurance coverage as it relates to the cost of repairing the damaged Zoo facility (in the aggregate the "Total Shortfall"), to the extent that the Total Shortfall exceeds $500,000. At such time as the City gives WPZS the Insurance Notice, WPZS shall have the following options: a) attempt to negotiate changes to the Agreement to address the changes in the insurance coverages; or b) terminate the Agreement. For sixty (60) days following City presentation to the WPZS of the Insurance Notice or such earlier time the parties either agree on new insurance provisions or this Agreement is terminated, the City shall be responsible for all deductibles, self-insured retention, or other shortfalls in insurance coverage in excess of $500,000 (which WPZS shall remain responsible for); thereafter, the WPZS shall be responsible for all deductibles, self-insured retention, or other shortfalls in insurance coverage regardless of amount.

 In the event that damage to multiple facilities creates an aggregate obligation for WPZS greater than $2,000,000 in any policy period, the City is not otherwise responsible for making up the shortfall as provided herein, and WPZS is unwilling or unable to make up the difference, the City, in its sole discretion, after consultation with WPZS, shall determine whether to repair all damaged facilities. At a minimum, the City will make repairs to the extent that would be required if the $2,000,000 limit were not exceeded. If the City decides to not repair all damaged facilities, the City will consult with WPZS about which facilities to repair. If the City determines not to repair all damaged facilities, WPZS' sole remedy will be to terminate the Agreement.

 The $500,000 and $2,000,000 amounts for deductibles, self-insured retention, and other insurance shortfalls will be adjusted periodically by the City so that the limits generally reflect the values as of the date this agreement is signed.

 To illustrate the operation of the foregoing, assume that the City has determined that it is fiscally responsible on a citywide basis to insure City facilities (including Zoo facilities) as follows:

 Deductible $400,000 Self-insured retention for damages from $1.1 million to $1.5 million Insure City buildings at 90% of replacement value

 Assume further that the Zoo facility in the following examples has a replacement value of $4 million.

 Example 1. The Zoo facility is damaged and the repair cost is $375,000. In this example, WPZS is responsible for the entire $375,000 whether the City gives WPZS the Insurance Notice or not.

 Example 2. The Zoo facility is damaged and the repair cost is $735,000. In this example, WPZS is responsible for the $400,000 deductible and the insurance is responsible for $335,000 whether the City gives WPZS the Insurance Notice or not.

 Example 3. The Zoo facility is damaged and the repair cost is $1.3 million. In this example, if the City has not given WPZS the Insurance Notice, WPZS is responsible for $500,000 ($400,000 deductible + first $100,000 of self-insured retention), the City is responsible for $100,000 ($1.3 million total repair cost - $1.2 million ($1.1 million + first $100,000 of self-insured retention paid for by WPZS)), and the insurance company is responsible for $700,000. If the City has given WPZS the Insurance Notice (and WPZS has not elected to terminate the Agreement), WPZS is responsible for $600,000 ($400,000 deductible + $200,000 of self- insured retention), the City is responsible for $0 and the insurance company is responsible for $700,000.

 Example 4. The Zoo facility is completely destroyed. In this example, if the City has not given WPZS the Insurance Notice, WPZS is responsible for $500,000 ($400,000 deductible + first $100,000 of self-insured retention), the City is responsible for $700,000 ($4 million total repair cost - $3.6 million (policy limit) + $300,000 remaining self-insured retention ($1.5 million - $1.2 million ($1.1 million + first $100,000 of self-insured retention paid for by WPZS))), and the insurance company is responsible for $2.8 million. If the City has given WPZS the Insurance Notice (and WPZS has not elected to terminate the Agreement), WPZS is responsible for $1.2 million ($400,000 deductible + $400,000 of self-insured retention + $400,000 excess cost over policy limits), the City is responsible for $0 and the insurance company is responsible for $2.8 million.

 To the extent that the cost of repairing damage to a Zoo facility is covered by insurance, the City and WPZS shall mutually agree as to whether the Zoo facility shall be repaired. In the event that insurance proceeds do not cover the cost of repair, the City is not otherwise responsible for making up the insurance shortfall, as provided herein, and WPZS is unwilling or unable to make up the difference, the City, in its sole discretion, after consultation with WPZS, shall determine whether to repair the damaged facility. If the City determines not to repair a damaged facility, WPZS' sole remedy will be to terminate the Agreement.

 In the event that damage to multiple facilities creates an aggregate obligation for WPZS greater than $2,000,000 in any policy period, the City is not otherwise responsible for making up the shortfall, and WPZS is unwilling or unable to make up the difference, the City, in its sole discretion, after consultation with WPZS, shall determine whether to repair all damaged facilities. At a minimum, the City will make repairs to the extent that would be required if the $2,000,000 limit were not exceeded. If the City decides to not repair all damaged facilities, the City will consult with WPZS about which facilities to repair. If the City determines not to repair all damaged facilities, WPZS's sole remedy will be to terminate the Agreement.

 The $500,000 and $2,000,000 amounts for deductibles, self-insured retention, and other insurance shortfalls will be adjusted periodically by the City so that the limits generally reflect the values as of the date this agreement is signed.

 Mutual Waiver of Subrogation Rights. WPZS and the City hereby mutually release each other from all liabilities and claims and waive all rights of recovery against each other for and to the extent of their respective property insurance coverages for such liabilities and claims, including any extended coverage and endorsements thereto; provided, however, that this release and waiver shall be inapplicable if it would have the effect, but only to the extent that is would have the effect, of invalidating any insurance coverage of either party.

 C. Fidelity and Crime Coverage (Bond). WPZS, at no expense to the City, shall provide Fidelity and Crime coverage of the following minimum limit:

 Blanket Fidelity Coverage $250,000

 D. Business Interruption Insurance. The City will not be responsible for any "business interruption" losses suffered by WPZS as a result of damage to a Zoo facility. WPZS shall determine whether to acquire insurance to cover any such losses.

 E. Evidence of Insurance. The following applies to all insurance coverage required to be provided by WPZS. The following documents must be provided as evidence of insurance coverage:

 - A copy of the policies' declaration pages, showing the insuring company, policy effective dates, limits of liability, and the schedule of forms and endorsements. The City reserves the right to require copies of all policies and requested endorsements.

 - A copy of the endorsement naming The City of Seattle as an Additional Insured, showing the policy number, and signed by an authorized representative of the insurance company on Form CG20 10 (ISO) or equivalent for Commercial General Liability insurance and CA20 48 (ISO) or equivalent for Business Auto Liability Insurance.

 - A copy of an endorsement stating that the coverages provided by this policy to the City or any other named insured shall not be terminated, reduced or otherwise materially changed without providing at least sixty (60) days prior written notice to the City of Seattle.

 - For Commercial General Liability and Business Automobile Liability Insurance, a copy of a "Separation of Insureds" or "Severability of Interests" clause, indicating essentially that - except with respect to the limits of insurance, and any rights or duties specifically assigned to the first named insured - this insurance applies as if each named insured were the only named insured, and separately to each insured against whom claim is made or suit is brought.

 F. Policy Rating and Primary Insurance Requirements. All policies shall be subject to approval by the City's Risk Manager as to insurance company (must be rated A-:Vll or better in the A.M. Bests Key Rating guide and licensed to do business in the State of Washington or issued as a surplus lines by a Washington Surplus Lines broker), form and coverage, and primary to all other insurance.

 G. Remedies Upon Failure to Insure. The Superintendent shall notify WPZS whenever the Superintendent has a reasonable belief that WPZS has failed to secure or maintain insurance as required by this Agreement. At the option of the Superintendent, the City may procure the required insurance for and at the ultimate expense of WPZS, from whatever source the Superintendent or the City's Risk Manager deems reasonable. In the event the insurance required of WPZS is procured by the City, WPZS shall also reimburse all costs incurred by the City to secure such insurance coverage as well as a service charge, the initial amount of which shall be Two Hundred and Fifty Dollars ($250.00), which reimbursement and service charge, at the discretion of the Superintendent, may be either credited against any compensation or expense reimbursement due to WPZS or invoiced to them for payment to the City. ta EXHIBIT B
