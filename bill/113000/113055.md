 WHEREAS, the City's work plan for the University Urban Center Plan, approved by City Council in Resolution No. 29808, identifies key strategies that are critical to the successful implementation of the University Urban Center Plan, and one of the key strategies of the University Urban Center Plan is the acquisition of Ravenna Woods as a natural area (Approval and Adoption Matrix, Activity D18); NOW THEREFORE,
