 ORDINANCE ______

 AN ORDINANCE relating to the impoundment of vehicles, amending Section 11.30.105 of the Seattle Municipal Code.

 WHEREAS in 1998 the City Council passed Ordinance 119180 allowing the impoundment of vehicles driven by persons arrested for of driving while license suspended or revoked (DWLS) in the first, second, or third degree; and

 WHEREAS one of the main rationales for impounding the vehicles driven by persons arrested for DWLS is to increase public safety by deterring bad driving; and

 WHEREAS there is substantial evidence of significant public safety benefits from impounding vehicles of persons arrested for DWLS in the first or second degree, but as yet no compelling evidence of significant public safety benefits from impounding vehicles of persons arrested for DWLS in the third degree; and

 WHEREAS, if there is not a significant public safety benefit, the direct and indirect economic impacts on some persons of vehicle impounds exceeds the public benefits from the impound; and
