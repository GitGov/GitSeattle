 WHEREAS, Washington State Law establishes $100.00 (One Hundred Dollars) as the maximum permit fee for outdoor and indoor fireworks displays; and,

 WHEREAS, in order to be more consistent and equitable regarding charges for similar hazardous material permit inspection services, the Seattle Fire Department will eliminate a permit code for helicopter lifts and reinstate a time charge for special permits which address unique or infrequent hazardous operations, Now, Therefore,

 BE IT ORDAINED BY THE CITY OF SEATTLE AS FOLLOWS:

 Section 1. Seattle Municipal Code Section 22.602.040 and its Schedules (Ordinance 110893 Section 2 (part), as last amended by Ordinance 119256 Section 1), are further amended as follows:

 C. Hazardous Material Related Permits. Fees for hazardous material related permits are established in Schedule C (See Table 22.602.040 C). In some cases these fees are based on the quantity of hazardous material stored and/or handled at the site and the relative risk posed by each material.

 1. Definitions:

 a. "Quantity Range Number" as established in the Quantity Range Table below, is a number between 1 and 2 which is assigned to a hazard category based upon the amount of hazardous material located at the site.

 QUANTITY RANGE TABLE

 QUANTITY RANGE SOLIDS LIQUIDS GASES NUMBER (Pounds) (Gallons) (Cu. Ft.)

 1 0-550 0-55 0-1,000

 1.25 >550 - 5,500 >55 - 550 >1,000 - 5,000

 1.5 >5,500 - 27,500 >550 - 2,750 >5,000 - 50,000

 1.75 >27,500 - 55,000 >2,750 - 5,500 >50,000 - 100,000

 2 >55,000 >5,500 >100,000

 b. "Assigned Risk Factor" as established below, is a number assigned to each hazard class and category of hazardous material indicating the relative hazard posed by materials in that hazard category.

 Hazard Category Assigned Hazard Category Assigned Risk Risk Factor Factor

 Aerosol products 1.3 Liquid petroleum gas 1.4

 Cellulose nitrate 1.3 Magnesium 1.3

 Combustible fiber 1.2 Organic peroxides

 Combustible liquids Unclassified 1.5

 Class II 1.2 Class I 1.4

 Class III-A 1.1 Class II 1.3

 Class III-B 1.1 Class III 1.2

 Compressed gases Class IV 1.1

 Highly toxic 1.5 Oxidizers

 Pyrophoric 1.4 Class 4 1.5

 Flammable 1.4 Class 3 1.4

 Unstable 1.4 Class 2 1.~~3~~2

 Oxidizing 1.4 Class 1 1.~~2~~1

 Toxic 1.3 Pyrophoric liquids 1.3

 Cryogenic 1.3 Radioactives 1.4

 Corrosive 1.3 Toxic liquids/solids 1.2

 Corrosives 1.1 Unstable (reactive) liquids/solids

 Explosives/Blasting 1.5 Class 4 1.5 agents

 Flammable liquids Class 3 1.4

 Class I-A 1.5 Class 2 1.3

 Class I-B 1.4 Class 1 1.2

 Class I-C 1.3 Water-reactive materials

 Flammable solids 1.3 Class 3 1.5

 Highly toxic 1.5 Class 2 1.3 liquids/solids

 Class 1 1.1

 c. "Fixed permit cost" Ninety-eight Dollars ($98.00) is the minimum cost for the Seattle Fire Department to issue a hazardous material permit.

 d. "Base permit fee" is determined by multiplying the sum of the products of the quantity range number and assigned risk factor for each hazard class by the fixed permit cost divided by 1.1 and is represented by the following equation:

 Base permit fee = [ (Q)(R)][F/1.1] Where: Q = The quantity range number. R = The assigned risk factor. F = The fixed permit cost ($98.00).

 Example:

 XYZ Company stores five hundred (500) gallons of gasoline and two hundred (200) pounds of nitric acid. Gasoline is classified as a Class I-B flammable liquid which has an assigned risk factor of 1.4. Nitric acid is classified as a corrosive liquid and a Class 1 oxidizer, both of which have an assigned risk factor of 1.1.

 Base permit fee = [(1.25)(1.4)flammable + (1)(1.1)Class 1 oxidizer][$98./1.1]

 Base permit fee = $253.91

 When a material has multiple hazards, only the hazard presented by the material that has been assigned the highest risk factor shall be considered.

 D. All permits listed under subsection A and C of this section, except for those permits for which a time charge is indicated,  have a base fee which incorporates the cost of an initial site inspection and one (1) site reinspection to determine compliance with the Seattle Fire Code. Permits for which a time charge is indicated include a base fee and a labor charge calculated on actual costs for labor and other services incurred by the Fire Department before a permit is issued. Any subsequent inspections will result in a fee based on a time charge which shall be calculated on actual costs for labor and other services. Such fees shall include overtime costs only when the work performed outside normal business hours (eight a.m. (8:00 a.m.) to four-thirty p.m. (4:30 p.m.) Monday through Friday) is required by the Seattle Fire Code or is performed at the request of the owner or responsible person or permit holder.

 E. Temporary permits listed under Schedule A and C will not be renewed on an annual basis.

 F. Those permit applications which are required to be filed within time limitations specified under the Seattle Fire Code or by order of the Fire Chief, shall be subject to a late fee, if not filed within the prescribed time period. The late fee shall be calculated at 1.75 times the original permit fee.

 For permits listed under Schedules A and C as renewable, renewal payments received more than thirty (30) days, but less than ninety- one (91) days, past the permit expiration date, shall be subject to a late fee. Permit renewal payments received more than ninety (90) days past the expiration date will not be processed as a renewal and will be subject to original permit fees and the new permit application process.

 G. Unless specifically stated on the permit, no temporary use permit shall be valid for a term exceeding twelve (12) months.

 H. Each examination fee listed under this section shall include one (1) test and one (1) re-test.

 I. The annual permit renewal fee for Schedule C permits where the fee worksheet is used to determine permit fee will be one-half (1/2) of the original base permit fee, if the facility is found to be in compliance with the original permit conditions.

 J. Effective January 1, 1999, those facilities which have existing hazardous materials-related permits authorized under Ordinance 116258 shall have their permits renewed at the rate of Ninety Eight Dollars ($98.00) until the Fire Department Article 80 program inspection and inventory analysis for the facility has been performed.

 K. In special circumstances, hazardous material permit fees may be adjusted, modified or combined. Authority to adjust, modify or combine such permit fees is limited to the Fire Chief, the Fire Marshal and the Assistant Fire Marshal.

 Section 2. Any acts consistent with and prior to the effective date of this Ordinance are hereby ratified and confirmed.

 Section 3. This ordinance shall take effect and be in force thirty (30) days from and after its approval by the Mayor, but if not approved and returned by the Mayor within ten (10) days after presentation, it shall take effect as provided by Municipal Code Section 1.04.020.
