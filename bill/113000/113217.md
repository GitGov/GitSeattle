 Subsections XII.C.4, XII.C.5, and XII.C.8 of the Amended Premises Use & Occupancy Agreement are amended as follows:

 4. Advertising Display Opportunities Available for Hockey Franchise Acting as "Host Team" in KeyArena: Any semi-professional or professional hockey franchise using the KeyArena for events in which its team acts as the "host" or "home team" including but not limited to the Seattle Thunderbirds Hockey Club, Inc. and its successors and assigns shall have the exclusive right to provide Advertising services and to sell and display Advertising on the ice playing surface displayed, on the dasherboards erected, and on the Zamboni ice machine used, for any hockey game presented by any such entity in the KeyArena. SSI shall have the right to offer to the purchasers of SSI's KeyArena Advertising or any portion thereof, the right to advertise on the ice playing surface, the dasherboards, and Zamboni at a charge to be set by and paid to the hockey franchise. If the purchasers of SSI's KeyArena Advertising or any portion thereof elect not to advertise on the ice playing surface, the dasherboards, and the Zamboni or any of the same, then the hockey franchise shall have the right to sell Advertising rights on the ice playing surface, the dasherboards, and Zamboni or any of the same but only at the charge offered to the purchasers of SSI's KeyArena Advertising or any portion thereof. At SSI's request, the City shall perform a financial audit to determine the amount of revenue received or receivable by the Seattle Thunderbirds Hockey Club, Inc. from the sale of advertising pursuant to such hockey club's agreement with the City. Upon the City's receipt, pursuant to Ch. 42.17 R.C.W., of a written request for the data in or conclusions of such audit, the City shall provide to SSI such information as is requested by SSI unless the City is judicially ordered to not do so.

 5. City's Right to Temporarily Interrupt, Without Compensation to SSI, Certain Advertising Displays Due to Conflict with Theatrical Performance or User's Policies or Religious Tenets: Notwithstanding the Advertising rights granted to SSI herein, the City reserves the right to temporarily interrupt or otherwise prevent the illumination or display of particular Advertising on any and all signs installed by or for SSI in the KeyArena (including the scoreboard and signs on or incorporated in the same) for any event or activity other than an SSI use authorized under this Agreement, without having to remit to SSI the payment contemplated in Subsection XII.C.6, hereof, whenever the Seattle Center Director determines, in the exercise of such official's discretion, that the illumination of such Advertising on SSI's sign(s) would conflict with any aspect of a third party's actual theatrical presentation or activity occurring within the area of the KeyArena in which Seats are located (as opposed to the lobby, box office, concourses, concession facilities, the Food service areas associated with Club Seats, SSI Unlimited Use Facilities, and similar areas of the KeyArena); or such Advertising display (whether or not illuminated) would otherwise offend or be inconsistent or in conflict with any announced policy of the Western Interscholastic Athletic Association, the National Collegiate Athletic Association, or any successor of either such entity, or to any third party KeyArena user as a result of such user's religious tenets. (The exercise of this reserved right may be illustrated by the following non-exclusive examples: If the KeyArena were licensed or leased for use for the presentation of a musical or theatrical performance, circus, or similar event for which a blacking-out of the house is required during any portion of the performance itself (in contrast to the intermissions and the pre- and post-performance ingress and egress periods), then the illumination of Advertising displays in the area of the KeyArena in which Seats are located could be extinguished during such portion of the performance. Similarly, if the KeyArena were licensed or leased for use as the site of a religious organization's convention, and the religion of the members of such organization enjoined or proscribed the use of caffeinated beverages, and the Seattle Center Director is advised that the displaying of Advertising for a caffeinated beverage at such convention site would be offensive to the religious organization, then the displaying on SSI's signs of a logo, trademark, service mark, or other text or design element that promotes the sale or use, or contains the tradename of any caffeinated beverage could be limited, restricted, or otherwise interrupted during such third party's use of the KeyArena.) The City's right to interrupt or prevent the displaying of Advertising as reserved herein shall be exercised as specified in Subsection XII.C.8, hereof.

 8. City Notice to SSI of Need for Advertising Display Interruption; SSI's Implementation of City Notices: The City's right to interrupt or prevent the displaying of Advertising, as reserved in Subsections XII.C.4-6, hereof, may be effected after the Seattle Center Director has given notice to SSI of such conflict, by requesting that SSI cover such sign(s) or the image(s) thereon, or by not providing electricity to illuminate the same, and by specifying the necessary period of such Advertising display interruption. Immediately following SSI's receipt of such request, SSI shall cover or discontinue the electricity service to the subject Advertising for the duration of the specified interruption period or request City staff to perform such covering or electricity discontinuation on SSI's behalf, which service shall be performed for SSI at the City's direct cost therefor.
