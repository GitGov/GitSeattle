 ORDINANCE _________________

 AN ORDINANCE relating to the use of proceeds from the sale of City- owned parcels in the South Lake Union area; increasing certain expenditure allowances in the 2001 budgets of various City departments by appropriating and/or transferring funds; transferring funds and recognizing repayment of certain reimbursable appropriations to the Cumulative Reserve Subfund; appropriating funds to repay general obligation bonds; and authorizing the Director of Finance to transfer those funds, when appropriate; all by a three-fourths vote of the City Council.

 WHEREAS, Council directed, through Resolution 30334, that expenses in the amount of $411,918 incurred by various City departments in conjunction with the sale of said properties be repaid from property proceeds; and
