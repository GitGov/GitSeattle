 ORDINANCE _________________ AN ORDINANCE relating to the Department of Parks and Recreation, concerning Red Barn Ranch, authorizing the Superintendent to execute and deliver a Quitclaim Deed to King County for public right-of-way purposes, thereby correcting an omission in the 1970 deed to the City and completing the intent of the previous owner for the benefit of the subject property.

 WHEREAS, Red Barn Ranch, located in rural King County, was acquired by the City of Seattle from Recreation Services, Inc., a Washington corporation, under deed recorded May 28, 1970, as authorized by Ordinance 98919 as "an educational and recreational facility for the Seattle Model City Program and for open space purposes, to be under the jurisdiction of the Department of Parks and Recreation" and as accepted by Ordinance 99139; and

 WHEREAS, Recreation Services, Inc., prior to its sale of the Red Barn Ranch property to the City, had entered into an EASEMENT AND AGREEMENT with the abutting property owner to cooperate "to have a 60 foot county road located on the [abutting] property and on the north 30 feet of the property owned by Recreation Services, Inc." and "to execute such instruments as may be required to establish such county road"; and

 WHEREAS, that EASEMENT AND AGREEMENT was signed by the parties and notarized on October 12, 1967, but was not recorded and made a matter of public record until October 29, 1973, and, thus, was not noted on the deed transferring the Red Barn Ranch property to the City; and

 WHEREAS, that road was constructed and has been used continuously since its construction in approximately 1969 and did exist prior to the City's purchase of the Red Barn Ranch property; and

 WHEREAS, the City was aware of the intent to deed a portion of the Red Barn Ranch property for county road purposes, as evidenced by the City's Deed of Right to the State of Washington, recorded June 30, 1972, and the City's Deed to the United State of America, recorded July 13, 1972, both deeds executed in acknowledgment of receipt of funds for public recreation purposes and both deeds excepting out "the north 30 feet for road;" and

 WHEREAS, King County has approached the City, asking the City to complete the process to establish this existing road as a County right-of-way, thereby allowing King County to make certain drainage improvements within the right-of-way and to assume maintenance of the roadway; and

 WHEREAS, the provisions of Ordinance 118477 (Initiative 42) are not invoked in that there is no change of use from park use to another use by the transfer of this existing City-owned roadway to the County to be recognized as a formal public right-of-way; and

 WHEREAS, the benefits to the City, in the assurance of improved, public right-of-way access to Red Barn Ranch and in the County accepting responsibility for maintenance of the road, are considerable; NOW, THEREFORE,

 BE IT ORDAINED BY THE CITY OF SEATTLE AS FOLLOWS:

 Section 1. The Superintendent of Parks and Recreation is hereby authorized to execute and record, for and on behalf of the City of Seattle, a Quitclaim Deed to King County, Washington, for the following described property: The north 30 feet of the Southeast 1/4 of the Northeast 1/4 of Section 24, Township 21 North, Range 5 East, W.M., except County Road No. 212 [currently known as SE Lake Moneysmith Road], situated in the County of King, State of Washington.

 Section 2. Consideration to the City from King County shall be in the off-setting benefit of County assumption of responsibility for perpetual maintenance of the right-of-way.
