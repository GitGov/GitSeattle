 UNSAFE BUILDINGS, STRUCTURES OR PREMISES

 102.1 Definition. For the purpose of this section unsafe buildings, structures or premises shall be defined to include all buildings or structures, whether erected before or after the effective date of this code, and all premises immediately surrounding buildings or structures which are structurally unsound or unsafe or not provided with adequate egress, or which constitute a fire hazard, or are otherwise dangerous to human life or which in relation to existing occupancy constitute a hazard to safety, health or public welfare by reason of inadequate maintenance, deterioration, instability, dilapidation, obsolescence, damage by fire or other causes or abandonment as specified in this code or any other effective ordinance.

 102.2 Emergency Orders. Whenever the building official finds that any building or structure, or portion thereof is in such a dangerous and unsafe condition as to constitute an imminent hazard to life or limb, the building official may issue an emergency order directing that the building or structure, or portion thereof be restored to a safe condition. The order shall specify the time for compliance. The order may also require that the building or structure, or portion thereof, be vacated within a reasonable time, to be specified in the order. In the case of extreme danger, the order may specify immediate vacation of the building or structure, or may authorize disconnection of the utilities or energy source pursuant to the notice provisions of Section 104.6. No person shall occupy the building or structure, or portion thereof after the date on which the building is required to be vacated until the building or structure, or portion thereof, is restored to a safe condition as required by the order and this code. It shall be unlawful for any person to fail to comply with an emergency order issued by the building official.

 102.3 Hazard Correction Order. Whenever the building official finds that an unsafe building, structure or premises exists, the building official may issue a hazard correction order specifying the conditions causing the building, structure or premises to be unsafe and directing the owner or other person responsible for the unsafe building, structure or premises to correct the condition. In lieu of correction, the owner may submit a report or analysis to the building official analyzing said conditions and establishing that the building, structure or premises is, in fact, safe. The building official may require that the report or analysis be prepared by a licensed engineer and may require compliance with Chapter 34. It shall be unlawful for any person to fail to comply with a hazard correction order as specified in this subsection.

 SECTION 103

 VIOLATIONS AND PENALTIES

 103.1. Violations. It shall be a violation of this code for any person, firm or corporation to erect, construct, enlarge, repair, move, improve, remove, convert, demolish, equip, occupy, inspect or maintain any building or structure in the City, contrary to or in violation of any of the provisions of this code.

 It shall be a violation of this code for any person, firm or corporation to knowingly aid, abet, counsel, encourage, hire, commend, induce or otherwise procure another to violate or fail to comply with this code.

 It shall be a violation of this code for any person, firm or corporation to use any material or to install any device, appliance or equipment which does not comply with applicable standards of this code or which has not been approved by the building official.

 103.2. Notice of Violation. If after investigation the building official determines that standards or requirements of this code have been violated, the building official may serve a notice of violation upon the owner or other person responsible for the action or condition. The notice of violation shall state the standards or requirements violated, shall state what corrective action, if any, is necessary to comply with the standards or requirements, and shall set a reasonable time for compliance. The notice shall be served upon the owner or other responsible person by regular first class mail addressed to the last known address of such person. In addition, a copy of the notice may be posted at a conspicuous place on the property. The notice of violation shall be considered an order of the building official. Nothing in this subsection shall be deemed to limit or preclude any action or proceeding pursuant to Sections 102 or 104 of this code, and nothing in this section shall be deemed to obligate or require the building official to issue a notice of violation prior to the imposition of civil or criminal penalties in this section.

 103.3 Civil Penalties. Any person, firm or corporation failing to comply with the provisions of this code shall be subject to a cumulative civil penalty in an amount not to exceed $500 per day for each violation from the date the violation occurs or begins until compliance is achieved. In cases where the building official has issued a notice of violation, the violation will be deemed to begin, for purposes of determining the number of days of violation, on the date compliance is required by the notice of violation. In any civil action for a penalty, the City has the burden of proving by a preponderance of the evidence that a violation exists or existed; the issuance of the notice of violation or of an order following a review by the Director is not itself evidence that a violation exists.

 103.4 Criminal Penalty. Any person who violates or fails to comply with this chapter shall be guilty of a gross misdemeanor subject to the provisions of Chapters 12A.02 and 12A.04, except that absolute liability shall be imposed for such a violation or failure to comply and none of the mental states described in Section 12A.04.030 need be proved. The Director may request the City Attorney prosecute such violations criminally as an alternative to the civil penalty provision outlined in this code. Each day any person, firm or corporation shall continue to violate or fail to comply with the provisions of this chapter and each occurrence of a prohibited activity shall constitute a separate offense.

 103.5 Additional Relief. The building official may seek legal or equitable relief to enjoin any acts or practices and abate any condition that constitutes a violation of this code when civil or criminal penalties are inadequate to effect compliance. In any such action, the City has the burden of proving by a preponderance of the evidence that a violation exists or will exist; the issuance of the notice of violation or of an order following a review by the Director is not itself evidence that a violation exists or will exist.

 103.6 Notices. It shall be unlawful for any person to remove, mutilate, destroy or conceal any notice issued or posted by the building official pursuant to the provisions of this code, or any notice issued or posted by the building official in response to a natural disaster or other emergency.

 The building official may record a copy of any order or notice with the Department of Records and Elections of King County.

 The building official may record with the Department of Records and Elections of King County a notification that a permit has expired without a final inspection after reasonable efforts have been made to provide a final inspection.

 103.7 Review By The Director

When the last day of the period computed is a Saturday, Sunday, federal or City holiday, the period shall run until 5:00 p.m. of the next business day. Upon receipt of a request, the Director shall notify the person requesting the review of the date, time and place of the Director's review. The review shall be not less than ten nor more than twenty days after the request is received, unless otherwise agreed by the person requesting the review. Any person affected by the notice of violation may submit any written material to the Director for consideration on or before the date of the review.

 103.7.2 The review will consist of an informal review meeting held at the Department. A representative of the Director who is familiar with the case and the applicable regulations will attend. The Director's representative will consider any information presented by the persons attending and in the Department's enforcement file. At or after the review, the Director shall issue an order of the Director that may:

 1. Sustain the notice of violation; or

 2. Withdraw the notice of violation; or

 Section 40. Subsection 502.1 of the International Building Code, 2003 Edition, is amended as follows:

 502.1 Definitions. The following words and terms shall, for the purposes of this chapter and as used elsewhere in this code, have the meanings shown herein.

 AREA, BUILDING. The area included within surrounding exterior walls (or exterior walls and fire walls) exclusive of vent shafts and courts. Areas of the building not provided with surrounding walls shall be included in the building area if such areas are included within the horizontal projection of the roof or floor above.

 BASEMENT. That portion of a building that is partly or completely below grade plane (See "Story above grade plane" in Section 202). A basement shall be considered as a story above grade plane where the finished surface of the floor above the basement is:

 1. More than 6 feet (1829 mm) above grade plane;

 2. More than 6 feet (1829 mm) above the finished ground level for more than 50 percent of the total building perimeter; or

 3. More than 12 feet (3658 mm) above the finished ground level ~~at any point~~for more than 25 feet (7620 mm) of the perimeter. Required driveways up to 22 feet (6706 mm) shall not be considered in calculating the 25 foot distance if there is at least 10 feet (3048 mm) between the driveway and all portions of the 25-foot area. See Figure 502.1.

GRADE PLANE. A reference plane representing the average of finished ground level adjoining the building at exterior walls. Where the finished ground level slopes away from the exterior walls, the reference plane shall be established by the lowest points within the area between the building and the lot line or, where the lot line is more than 6 feet (1829 mm) from the building, between the building and a point 6 feet (1829 mm) from the building.

For grade of structures built over water, see Section 421.2.

 HEIGHT, BUILDING. The vertical distance from grade plane to the average height of the highest roof surface.

 HEIGHT, STORY. The vertical distance from top to top of two successive finished floor surfaces; and, for the topmost story, from the top of the floor finish to the top of the ceiling joists or, where there is not a ceiling, to the top of the roof rafters.

 INDUSTRIAL EQUIPMENT PLATFORM. An unoccupied, elevated platform in an industrial occupancy used exclusively for mechanical systems or industrial process equipment, including the associated elevated walkways, stairs and ladders necessary to access the platform (see Section 505.5).

 MEZZANINE. An intermediate level or levels between the floor and ceiling of any story with an aggregate floor area of not more than ~~one-third~~one-half of the area of the room or space in which the level or levels are located (see Section 505).

 STORY. That portion of a building included between the upper surface of a floor and the upper surface of the floor or roof next above (also see "Basement" and "Mezzanine").

Interpretation I502a: An unenclosed and uncovered roof deck shall not be considered a story for the purpose of determining the number of stories in a building.  Interpretation I502b: In stepped or terraced buildings, the number of stories is the number counted from the first story above grade plane of the lowest building segment to the top story of the highest building segment. For purposes of this interpretation, portions of buildings divided by fire walls shall be considered separate buildings.

 a + b = 25' Lowest level may be c = 10' a basement below d = 22' grade if all these are met

 503.1.1 Basements. Basements that are not stories above grade plane  need not be included in the total allowable area provided they do not exceed the area permitted for a one-story building.

 503.1.2 Special industrial occupancies. Buildings and structures designed to house low-hazard industrial processes that require large areas and unusual heights to accommodate craneways or special machinery and equipment including, among others, rolling mills; structural metal fabrication shops and foundries; or the production and distribution of electric, gas or steam power, shall be exempt from the height and area limitations of Table 503.

 503.1.3 Buildings on same lot. Two or more buildings on the same lot shall be regulated as separate buildings or shall be considered as portions of one building if the height of each building and the aggregate area of buildings are within the limitations of Table 503 as modified by Sections 504 and 506. The provisions of this code applicable to the aggregate building shall be applicable to each building.

 503.1.4 Type I construction. Buildings of Type I construction permitted to be of unlimited tabular heights and areas are not subject to the special requirements that allow unlimited area buildings in Section 507 or unlimited height in Sections 503.1.2 and 504.3 or increased height and areas for other types of construction.

 SECTION 3404

 MOVED BUILDINGS

 3404.1 Nonresidential Buildings or Structures. Nonresidential buildings or structures moved into or within the city shall comply with standards adopted by the building official. The building official may require an inspection of the building before or after moving. The permit holder shall correct all deficiencies identified by the inspection. A bond or cash deposit in an amount sufficient to abate or demolish the building may be required to be posted prior to issuance of a permit. See Section 106 for information required on plans. Any moved building that is not in complete compliance with standards for moved buildings within eighteen months from the date of permit issuance and is found to be a public nuisance may be abated.

 3404.2 Residential Buildings or Structures. Residential buildings or structures moved into or within the city are not required to comply with all of the requirements of this code if the original occupancy classification of the building or structure is not changed. Compliance with all of the requirements of this chapter will be required if the moved residential buildings or structures undergo substantial alteration. Work performed on new and existing foundations shall comply with all of the requirements of this code for new construction.

 SECTION 3405

 CHANGE OF OCCUPANCY

 No change shall be made in the character of occupancies or use of any building which would place the building in a different division or subdivision of the same group of occupancy or in a different group of occupancies, unless such building is made to comply with the requirements of this chapter and the requirements of Chapter 4 for such division or group of occupancy. Change of tenants will be permitted so long as the character of the occupancy is not changed.

 EXCEPTION: The character of the occupancy of existing buildings may be changed subject to the approval of the building official, as set forth in Section 3403. The building may be occupied for purposes in other groups without conforming to all the requirements of this code for those groups, provided the new or proposed use is not more hazardous, based on life and fire risk, than the existing use.

 No change in the character of occupancy of a building shall be made without a certificate of occupancy, as required in Section 109 of this code. The building official may issue a certificate of occupancy pursuant to the intent of the above exception without certifying that the building complies with all provisions of this code.

 In addition to the requirements of Sections 420, 1203 and 2903, upon conversion of an existing building to residential occupancy, the elements of the dwelling unit envelope which are altered shall comply with the sound transmission control requirements of Section 1207.

 See Section 3403.12 for additional requirements for substantial alterations.

 SECTION 3406

 ACCESSIBILITY FOR EXISTING BUILDINGS

 3406.1 Scope. The provisions of Sections 3406.1 through 3406.8 apply to maintenance, change of occupancy, additions and alterations to existing buildings, including those identified as historic buildings.

 Exception: Type B dwelling or sleeping units required by Section 1107 are not required to be provided in existing buildings and facilities.

 3406.1.1 Definition. The following term shall, for the purposes of this chapter and as used elsewhere in the code, have the following meaning:

 TECHNICALLY INFEASIBLE. An alteration of a building or a facility that has little likelihood of being accomplished because the existing structural conditions require the removal or alteration of a load- bearing member that is an essential part of the structural frame, or because other existing physical or site constraints prohibit modification or addition of elements, spaces or features which are in full and strict compliance with the minimum requirements for new construction and which are necessary to provide accessibility.

 3406.2 Maintenance of facilities. A building, facility or element that is constructed or altered to be accessible shall be maintained accessible during occupancy.

 3406.3 Change of occupancy. Existing buildings, or portions thereof, that undergo a change of group or occupancy shall have all of the following accessible features:

 1. At least one accessible building entrance.

 2. At least one accessible route from an accessible building entrance to primary function areas.

 3. Signage complying with Section 1110.

 4. Accessible parking, where parking is being provided.

 5. At least one accessible passenger loading zone, when loading zones are provided.

 6. At least one accessible route connecting accessible parking and accessible passenger loading zones to an accessible entrance.

 Where it is technically infeasible to comply with the new construction standards for any of these requirements for a change of group or occupancy, the above items shall conform to the requirements to the maximum extent technically feasible. Change of group or occupancy that incorporates any alterations or additions shall comply with this section and Sections 3406.4, 3406.5, 3406.6 and 3406.7.

 3406.4 Additions. Provisions for new construction shall apply to additions. An addition that affects the accessibility to, or contains an area of primary function, shall comply with the requirements in Section 3406.6 for accessible routes.

 3406.5 Alterations. A building, facility or element that is altered shall comply with the applicable provisions in Chapter 11 and ICC A117.1, unless technically infeasible. Where compliance with this section is technically infeasible, the alteration shall provide access to the maximum extent technically feasible. Where alterations would increase the number of public pay telephones to four, with at least one in the interior, or where the facility has four or more public pay telephones and one or more is altered; at least one interior text telephone shall be provided.

 Exceptions:

 1. The altered element or space is not required to be on an accessible route, unless required by Section 3406.6.

 2. Accessible means of egress required by Chapter 10 are not required to be provided in existing buildings and facilities.

 3. In alterations, accessibility to raised or sunken dining areas, or to all parts of outdoor seating areas is not required provided that the same services and amenities are provided in an accessible space usable by the general public and not restricted to use by people with disabilities.

 3406.5.1 Extent of application. An alteration of an existing element, space or area of a building or facility shall not impose a requirement for greater accessibility than that which would be required for new construction.

 Alterations shall not reduce or have the effect of reducing accessibility of a building, portion of a building or facility.

 3406.6 Alterations affecting an area containing a primary function. Where an alteration affects the accessibility to, or contains an area of primary function, the route to the primary function area shall be accessible. The accessible route to the primary function area shall include toilet facilities, telephones or drinking fountains serving the area of primary function.

 Exceptions:

 1. The costs of providing the accessible route are not required to exceed 20 percent of the costs of the alterations affecting the area of primary function.

 2. This provision does not apply to alterations limited solely to windows, hardware, operating controls, electrical outlets and signs.

 3. This provision does not apply to alterations limited solely to mechanical systems, electrical systems, installation or alteration of fire protection systems and abatement of hazardous materials.

 4. This provision does not apply to alterations undertaken for the primary purpose of increasing the accessibility of an existing building, facility or element.

 3406.7 Scoping for alterations. The provisions of Sections 3406.7.1 through 3406.7.11 shall apply to alterations to existing buildings and facilities. Where an escalator or new stairway is planned or installed requiring major structural changes, then a means of vertical transportation (e.g., elevator, platform lift) shall be provided in accordance with this chapter.

 3406.7.1 Entrances. Accessible entrances shall be provided in accordance with Section 1105.

 Exception: Where an alteration includes alterations to an entrance, and the building or facility has an accessible entrance, the altered entrance is not required to be accessible, unless required by Section 3406.6. Signs complying with Section 1110 shall be provided.

 3406.7.2 Elevators. Altered elements of existing elevators shall comply with ASME A17.1 and ICC A117.1. Such elements shall also be altered in elevators programmed to respond to the same hall call control as the altered elevator. Elevators shall comply with chapter 296-96 WAC.

 3406.7.3 Platform lifts. Platform (wheelchair) lifts complying with ICC A117.1 and installed in accordance with ASME A18.1 shall be permitted as a component of an accessible route. Platform lifts shall comply with chapter 296-96 WAC.

 3406.7.4 Stairs and escalators in existing buildings. In alterations where an escalator or stair is added where none existed previously, an accessible route shall be provided in accordance with Sections 1104.4 and 1104.5.

 3406.7.5 Ramps. Where steeper slopes than allowed by Section 1010.2 are necessitated by space limitations, the slope of ramps in or providing access to existing buildings or facilities shall comply with Table 3406.7.5.

 TABLE 3406.7.5

 RAMPS

 SLOPE MAXIMUM RISE

 Steeper than 1:10 but not steeper than 3 inches 1:8

 Steeper than 1:12 but not steeper than 6 inches 1:10

 3406.7.6 Performance areas. Where it is technically infeasible to alter performance areas to be on an accessible route, at least one of each type of performance area shall be made accessible.

 3406.7.7 Dwelling or sleeping units. Where I-1, I-2 , I-3, R-1, R-2 or R-4 dwelling or sleeping units are being altered or added, the requirements of Section 1107 for Accessible or Type A units and Chapter 9 for accessible alarms apply only to the quantity of spaces being altered or added.

 3406.7.8 Jury boxes and witness stands. In alterations, accessible wheelchair spaces are not required to be located within the defined area of raised jury boxes or witness stands and shall be permitted to be located outside these spaces where the ramp or lift access restricts or projects into the means of egress.

 3406.7.9 Toilet rooms. Where it is technically infeasible to alter existing toilet and bathing facilities to be accessible, an accessible unisex toilet or bathing facility is permitted. The unisex facility shall be located on the same floor and in the same area as the existing facilities. The number of toilet facilities and water closets required by the State Building Code may be reduced by one, in order to provide accessible features.

 3406.7.10 Dressing, fitting and locker rooms. Where it is technically infeasible to provide accessible dressing, fitting or locker rooms at the same location as similar types of rooms, one accessible room on the same level shall be provided. Where separate-sex facilities are provided, accessible rooms for each sex shall be provided. Separate- sex facilities are not required where only unisex rooms are provided.

 3406.7.11 Check-out aisles. Where check-out aisles are altered, at least one of each check-out aisle serving each function shall be made accessible until the number of accessible check-out aisles complies with Section 1109.12.2.

 3406.8 Historic buildings. These provisions shall apply to buildings and facilities designated as historic structures that undergo alterations or a change of occupancy, unless technically infeasible. Where compliance with the requirements for accessible routes, ramps, entrances or toilet facilities would threaten or destroy the historic significance of the building or facility, as determined by the authority having jurisdiction, the alternative requirements of Sections 3406.8.1 through 3406.8.5 for that element shall be permitted.

 3406.8.1 Site arrival points. At least one accessible route from a site arrival point to an accessible entrance shall be provided.
