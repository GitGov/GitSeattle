 ORDINANCE __________

 AN ORDINANCE relating to the illegal sex industry; setting the amount of the fee imposed for pretrial diversion of a prostitution-related offense, the proceeds of which would be used for the care and treatment of the victims of the illegal sex industry; amending SMC 12A.10.070; providing for forfeiture of any monies paid as part of the alleged violation to be used to support investigation and arrest of those who patronize the illegal sex industry; and amending Ordinance 116666.

 WHEREAS, a large majority of sex industry workers are victims, who believe that they have few or no alternatives; and

 WHEREAS, sex industry workers often have complex problems that require comprehensive services; and

 WHEREAS, studies show that a majority of sex industry workers have been victims of sexual abuse; and

 WHEREAS, Seattle Police Department arrest statistics demonstrate that of the individuals arrested for prostitution, 96% regularly use narcotics, 65% have children and 70% are homeless; and

 WHEREAS, in 1994, the City of Seattle Department of Housing and Human Services identified women in the sex industry as one of the three populations most in need of specialized services; and

 WHEREAS, in July 1995, the Seattle Women's Commission recommended that the City of Seattle should support provision of comprehensive services to help women get out of the sex industry; and

 WHEREAS, the City of Seattle does not provide any funding for comprehensive services to women in the sex industry; and

 WHEREAS, the Seattle City Attorney's office in cooperation with the Seattle Municipal Court operates a pretrial diversion program for first time non-violent offenders, including those accused of patronizing the illegal sex industry, the intent of which is to allow good citizens who have made a mistake to avoid conviction and jail and to retain clean criminal records in exchange for not re-offending; and

 WHEREAS, in the preceding three years, approximately 70% of those charged with patronizing a prostitute took advantage of the pretrial diversion program; and

 WHEREAS, those charged with patronizing a prostitute have generally tendered funds in excess of $100 prior to their arrest and therefore generally have the financial ability to pay; and
