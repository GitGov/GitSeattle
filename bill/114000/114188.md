 AN ORDINANCE relating to the Department of Parks and Recreation and animal control; amending Section 18.12.080B 3 Exhibit J of the Seattle Municipal Code to modify the shoreline portion of the designated off- leash area at Sand Point Magnuson Park.

 WHEREAS, in November 1999, following an extensive public process, the City Council adopted the Magnuson Park Conceptual Design (Resolution 30063) which identifies the preferred location and boundaries of both the upland and the shoreline portions of the Magnuson Park Off-Leash Area; and

 WHEREAS, Seattle voters approved the Neighborhood Parks, Green Spaces, Trails, and Zoo Levy (2000 Parks Levy) in November 2000, which included $700,000 for improvements to the Magnuson Park Off-Leash Area including, in the shoreline area, a shelter, pathway lighting, potable water, shoreline improvements, an improved trail and fencing; and

 WHEREAS, the City Council approved the upland boundaries of the Magnuson Park Off-Leash Area by Ordinance 120594 in October, 2001; and

 WHEREAS, on February 15, 2002, the Superintendent of the Department of Parks and Recreation determined that no significant environmental impacts were likely to occur as a result of the change in boundaries and related improvements to the shoreline portion of the Magnuson Park Off-Leash Area, and on February 15, 2002, issued a Determination of Non-Significance (DNS) that was not appealed; and

 WHEREAS, the Department of Parks and Recreation is currently working with a consultant team to complete the applications for required federal, state, and local permits for physical improvements to the shoreline portion of the off-leash area and codifying the Council's preferred location and boundaries of the shoreline portion ensures that the proper boundaries for the existing off-leash area are clearly delineated in the permit application materials; and

 WHEREAS, this ordinance is now needed to modify the boundaries of the shoreline portion of the Magnuson Park Off-Leash Area (OLA) as contained as an exhibit to the Parks and Recreation section of the Seattle Municipal Code; and

 WHEREAS, the map attached to this ordinance reflects the Council's intent as expressed in Resolution 30063 including 175 feet of shoreline access.
