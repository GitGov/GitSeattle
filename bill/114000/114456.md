 AN ORDINANCE relating to relocation assistance for emergency orders, amending SMC Section 22.200.020 relating to the intent of the Code regarding relocation assistance payments; amending SMC Section 22.202.050 relating to fines and penalties deposited in the Housing and Abatement Account; adding a new SMC Section 22.202.060 to establish an account for the payment of emergency relocation assistance; amending SMC Section 22.206.260 to provide for annual adjustment to the amount of relocation assistance for emergency orders; adding a new SMC Section 22.206.265 to establish procedures for paying relocation assistance for emergency orders; amending SMC Section 22.206.280 to increase the penalty when a property owner fails to pay relocation assistance for an emergency order; and adding a new SMC Section 22.206.295 providing a private right of action for tenants.

 WHEREAS, the Seattle Housing and Building Maintenance Code (SMC Chapter 22.206) provides that property owners are required to pay relocation assistance to tenants who vacate their housing units pursuant to an Emergency Order to Vacate and Close issued because the condition of the building is an imminent threat to the health and safety of the occupants or the public; and

 WHEREAS, tenants who are required to move by an Emergency Order to Vacate and Close often have very low incomes and lack the financial resources to secure, on short notice, other affordable living accommodations; and

 WHEREAS, an Emergency Order to Vacate and Close often gives tenants less than seventy-two (72) hours to vacate an unsafe premises; and

 WHEREAS, owners of properties who are required to pay relocation assistance to tenants who vacate pursuant to an Emergency Order to Vacate and Close issued under the Housing and Building Maintenance Code frequently do not pay within the timeframe required by the ordinance; and

 WHEREAS, poor and low income tenants who vacate as required by an Emergency Order are at a greater risk of becoming homeless, because they do not have sufficient resources to secure alternative accommodations;

 NOW, THEREFORE,

 BE IT ORDAINED BY THE CITY OF SEATTLE AS FOLLOWS:

 Section 1. Section 22.200.020 of the Seattle Municipal Code, which was last amended by Ordinance 115671, is amended as follows:

 B. It is further found and declared that these conditions are the result of, among other causes: inadequate original construction; dilapidation; failure to repair; lack of proper sanitary facilities and maintenance; structural defects; vacant or abandoned buildings or properties; overcrowding; electrical, mechanical and other defects increasing the hazards of fire, accidents or other calamities; uncleanliness; inadequate heating, lighting and ventilation.
