 AN ORDINANCE authorizing the Superintendent of Parks and Recreation to sign and accept all documents necessary to complete an exchange of real property consisting of an easement for ingress and egress across the South Winthrop Street portion of Cheasty Boulevard to be granted to the University of Washington for two parcels of land, one owned by the University of Washington and one owned by Sound Transit augmenting the Cheasty Natural Area and finding that said exchange is necessary and no reasonable alternative exists consistent with the requirements of Ordinance 118477.

 WHEREAS, the South Winthrop Street portion of Cheasty Boulevard is undeveloped park property that does not provide access to adjacent properties; and

 WHEREAS, the University of Washington owns property adjacent to said Cheasty Boulevard and access to said property will be severely reduced by virtue of Sound Transit's acquisition of land for the McClellan Station and elevated guideway components of the Sound Transit Central Link Light Rail Project; and

 WHEREAS, the City of Seattle has entered into an Inter Agency Cooperation Agreement with Sound Transit authorized by Ordinance No. 118927 and five Supplemental Agreements have also been executed, each providing for cooperation between the City and Sound Transit relating to the implementation of Light Rail services to the citizens of Seattle; and

 WHEREAS, traffic and public safety concerns arising from the re- configuration of the University of Washington property can only be resolved by providing an access to South Winthrop Street; and

 WHEREAS, Ordinance 118477 requires that the City Council find, after a public hearing, that changing the use of park land to another use is necessary and that no reasonable alternative is available and that replacement property of equal or greater size, value, and usefulness is available to serve the same community; and

 WHEREAS, the University of Washington and Sound Transit have offered two adjacent parcels of land of greater size, value and usefulness to replace the property required for said access to the University of Washington property; and

 WHEREAS, the Seattle City Council has held a public hearing in accordance with the requirements of Ordinance 118477; NOW, THEREFORE,

 BE IT ORDAINED BY THE CITY OF SEATTLE AS FOLLOWS:

 Section 1. The City Council finds that the exchange of certain park property along the South Winthrop Street portion of Cheasty Boulevard for two parcels of land owned by Sound Transit and the University of Washington adjacent to the Cheasty Natural Area and having a combined value, size and usefulness that is greater than said Cheasty Boulevard property is necessary because no reasonable alternative exists, due in part to changes in street access to University properties that will result from the Sound Transit McClellan light rail station.

 Section 2. At the time that the Superintendent receives the property described in Section 3 from the University of Washington and Sound Transit, the Superintendent of Parks and Recreation, or his designee, is authorized to execute an Easement Deed for ingress and egress and such other documents as may be necessary to convey the following described property, which is a portion of Cheasty Boulevard to the University of Washington: The east 8 feet of Lot 12 of Block 38 of T.
