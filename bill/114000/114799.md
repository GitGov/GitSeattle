In the event of mediation, each party shall share the costs of the mediator equally, but in mediation and in any subsequent litigation, each party shall bear all of its own attorney and witness costs.

 Any disputes arising under this Contract that are not settled through discussion or mediation shall be brought in the Superior Court of the State of Washington for King County, at Seattle.
