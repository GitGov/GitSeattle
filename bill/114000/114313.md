 ORDINANCE _________________

 AN ORDINANCE relating to employees of the Department of Parks and Recreation, Zoo Program; establishing an incentive program for eligible employees of the Department of Parks and Recreation, Zoo Program; authorizing an agreement with the Woodland Park Zoological Society ("Zoo Society") concerning the transfer of sick leave and vacation balances for departing zoo employees; providing for employee waivers of cash payments for accumulated and unused sick and vacation leave balances; amending SMC 4.36.120D to extend a temporary service credit purchase to participants of this incentive program; and authorizing and ratifying a memorandum of understanding between the City and the bargaining representatives of the employees of the Department of Parks and Recreation, Zoo Program.

 WHEREAS, City of Seattle Ordinance 120697 approved an agreement between the City and the Woodland Park Zoological Society (the "Zoo Society") whereby the Zoo Society assumed responsibility for the operation and management of the Woodland Park Zoo over a renewable twenty-year period, beginning March 1, 2002 (the "Operations and Management Agreement"); and

 WHERAS, the Operations and Management Agreement provides for an Employee Transition Plan to be developed by December 31, 2002; and

 WHEREAS, the complete transition of Department of Parks and Recreation employees currently assigned to the Zoo from City employment to Zoo Society employment will assist the Zoo Society in fully and efficiently executing its responsibilities under the Operations and Management Agreement; and

 WHEREAS, one hundred and twenty-four (124) employees of the Department of Parks and Recreation, Zoo Program, were accepted for the City's Separation Incentive Program with a deadline of September 30, 2002 for separation from City employment as authorized by City Ordinances 120880, 120881 and 120891; and

 WHEREAS, while the City's Separation Incentive Program offered eligible employees certain incentives for separation, the Program did not provide Zoo employees transitioning to the Zoo Society with credit for their accumulated and unused vacation and sick leave balances as provided in the Operations and Management Agreement; and

 WHEREAS, the City Council finds that the establishment of a special incentive program for City employees assigned to the Zoo ("Separation Incentive Program -- Zoo Program") offering incentives greater than those provided by the City's Separation Incentive Program is in the best interests of the City, the Woodland Park Zoo, and the Zoo Society, which has born the personnel expenses of the Zoo since March 2002, and would facilitate an expeditious and efficient transition of employment resources from the City to the Zoo Society, especially in light of the deadline of September 30, 2002 for separation from City employment under the City's Separation Incentive Program;

 NOW THEREFORE

 BE IT ORDAINED BY THE CITY OF SEATTLE AS FOLLOWS:

 Section 1. Authorization for Employee Transition Agreement. The Superintendent of Parks and Recreation ("Superintendent") is authorized to enter into an agreement with the Woodland Park Zoological Society (the "Zoo Society") in substantially the form attached hereto as attachment 1. Sections 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6 of this Ordinance shall not take effect until such an agreement has been executed by the Superintendent and a representative of the Zoo Society.

 Section 2. The Mayor and the City Council authorize the Superintendent to implement the Separation Incentive Program -- Zoo Program as herein described for qualified, regularly appointed employees of the Department of Parks and Recreation, Zoo Program.

 Section 3. The Separation Incentive Program -- Zoo Program shall be established as follows:

 A. Eligibility. Participation in the Separation Incentive Program -- Zoo Program (the "Program") is voluntary. An employee is eligible to participate in the Program if, in the judgment of the Superintendent, his or her separation from City employment supports the business need of the Department of Parks and Recreation (the "Department") and the Zoo Society to transition experienced employees from City to Zoo Society employment, and such employee agrees to separate from City employment on or before December 4, 2002.

 B. Zoo Separation Incentive Payment. The Zoo separation incentive payment shall be the equivalent of eight weeks of pay, determined by multiplying the employee's regular straight-time weekly wage by eight. The regular straight-time weekly wage is the hourly rate of pay the employee receives for the position to which he or she has a regular appointment, effective the date of his or her termination, times the number of non-overtime hours the employee is authorized to work on a weekly basis, not to exceed 40 hours per week. For part-time employees who work a fluctuating schedule, the regular straight-time weekly wage shall be calculated using an average of hours worked during the 26 pay periods preceding the date of his or her application to participate in the Program, or the number of pay periods since his or her initial appointment to City employment, whichever is less.

 C. Distribution of Zoo Incentive Payment. An employee accepted for participation in the Program may select any of the following options, or any combination of these options, for distribution of the Zoo separation incentive payment, less any mandatory deductions and subject to any legal limitations:

 1. A lump sum payment.

 2. Payment of the employee's and the employer's costs to purchase up to four additional years of service credit in the City Employees' Retirement System. The Zoo separation incentive payment may be combined with any payment the employee opts to receive for the cash- out of vacation, compensatory time, and/or sick leave as applicable and/or any additional personal resources to the extent permitted by law for purposes of purchasing such service credit. An employee who has been demoted or reduced to a lower-paying position within one month of his or her application for inclusion in the Program or is demoted or reduced at any time subsequent to his or her application through the date of actual termination from City employment may not elect this option.

 3. Deferral to the employee's existing Section 457 Deferred Compensation Account. The combination of the employee's year-to-date deferrals plus the amount deferred from the Zoo separation incentive payment may not exceed the Internal Revenue Code maximum deferral amount.

 4. Payment of currently-enrolled health care benefits at the City's COBRA rate, subject to any rate changes, for a maximum of 18 months.

 D. Two Year Prohibition of Re-Employment with City. Any employee who accepts the Zoo separation incentive payment is prohibited from re- employment with the City of Seattle for a period of two years following his or her termination date. This prohibition covers full- time, part-time, civil service exempt and non-exempt and temporary positions, as well as consulting and contract work.

 E. Release of All Claims. Any employee who accepts the Zoo separation incentive payment will be required, as a condition of such payment, to release all claims he or she may have against the City and/or its officers, employees and agents.

 F. Application and Approval.

 1. An employee who wishes to participate in the Program shall make application to the Superintendent on the form provided for that purpose between September 18, 2002 and close of business September 30, 2002, inclusive.

 2. The Superintendent shall make the determination whether to accept the application, and shall provide each applicant an irrevocable notification of his or her determination no later than close of business October 3, 2002.

 3. Each employee who receives notification of acceptance for receipt of the Zoo separation incentive payment shall have until close of business November 18, 2002 to consider whether to participate in the Program. Failure of the employee to complete and submit the required Agreement and Release Form and Options Distribution Form to the Human Resources Director of the Department by close of business on November 18, 2002 shall constitute his or her withdrawal from the Program.

 4. Each employee who submits the required Agreement and Release Form and Options Distribution Form shall have until close of business on the seventh calendar day following such submission but no later than November 25, 2002 to withdraw from participation in the Program. Thereafter the employee's participation is irrevocable.

 Section 4. Seattle Municipal Code Section 4.36.120 subsection D is hereby amended as follows:

 SMC 4.36.120 Modification of allowance for service.

 * * *

 D. A member of the City Employees' Retirement System who has entered into an irrevocable separation incentive agreement with the City pursuant to the terms of ((either of)) the ordinances introduced as Council Bills 114257, ((and)) 114258, or 114313 may purchase up to four years of service credit from the Retirement System. To acquire such service credit:

 1. The member shall, within 14 days of payment of the net proceeds of the separation incentive payment, pay a lump sum into the retirement fund representing the employee's and the employer's contributions otherwise required to receive such service credit pursuant to Seattle Municipal Code Chapter 4.36; and

 2. The member may include in this lump sum additional personal resources to the extent permitted by law in order to purchase the full four years of service credit. Direct transfers and other rollovers of funds from other retirement plans under Municipal Code Section 4.36.101 must be made prior to the member's separation from City employment; and

 3. All purchases under this Subsection are subject to all other limitations on total service credit and benefits allowable under SMC 4.36.

 * * *

 Section 5. Employee Waiver of Right to Receive Cash-out of Sick Leave and Vacation Leave Balances. Any City employee who has a regular appointment to a position authorized in the Zoo Program in the 2002 Adopted City Budget who separates from City employment under the auspices of the Separation Incentive Program -- Zoo Program as authorized in Sections 2 and 3 of this Ordinance, and who signs the legally necessary instructions to the City by his or her separation date, may waive his or her right to receive cash-out of accumulated and unused sick leave and vacation balances as provided for by Seattle Municipal Code Sections 4.24.210 and 4.34.065, respectively, or by any applicable collective bargaining agreement.

 Section 6. City Payment to Zoo Society for Sick Leave and Vacation Leave Balances of Qualified Employees. For any individual who waives his or her right to a cash-out of leave benefits as set forth in section 5 herein and who meets the definition of a "Qualified Employee" as set forth in the Employee Transition Agreement between the City and the Zoo Society executed under the authority of Section 1 of this Ordinance, the City, in accordance with the terms of such Agreement, shall pay the Zoo Society the current cash value of such individual's accumulated and unused vacation balance and one-half of the current cash value of such individual's accumulated and unused sick leave balance in exchange for the Zoo Society crediting such employee with such employee's full sick leave and full vacation leave balances accumulated prior to such employee's separation.

 Section 7. Termination of City Responsibility upon Transfer of Sick Leave and Vacation Balance. In accordance with the terms of the Employee Transition Agreement and upon the Zoo Society's receipt of the City's payment of the negotiated value of such employee's sick leave and vacation balances, the City shall have no further responsibility or duty to such former employee regarding the terms and/or conditions of such employee's use of and access to transferred sick leave and vacation balances.

 Section 8. The Mayor is hereby authorized for and on behalf of the City of Seattle to execute a Memorandum of Understanding attached hereto as Attachment 2 with the certified bargaining representatives of employees of the Department of Parks and Recreation assigned to the Zoo. The Memorandum of Understanding is substantially in the form attached hereto and identified as "Memorandum of Understanding by and between the City of Seattle and Identified Signatory Unions".

 Section 10. Any acts made consistent with the authority and prior to the effective date of this ordinance are hereby ratified and confirmed.

Such payment will be made in the manner set forth below:

 3.1 Vacation Leave Balances. The City shall calculate for purposes of payment the Vacation Leave Balances for each Qualified Employee who was employed at the Zoo as of the effective date of the Operations and Management Agreement.
