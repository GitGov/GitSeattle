 TOTAL $2,290,000

 Project Descriptions:

 City of Seattle - Ballard Parks $375,000

 Consists of three passive open spaces in the Ballard community in Seattle; the value of structures on any of these three sites may not be funded with Conservation Futures Funds: 1) Tax parcel # 2767601960, "17th NW Neighborhood Park" at 1702 NW 62nd Street; 2) Tax parcel # 7589200136, "Baker Park Addition" at 8341 14th Avenue; 3) "Salmon Bay Natural Area", located southwest of NW 54th Street at 34th Avenue NW at Chittenden Locks, adjacent to the Burke-Gilman Regional Trail.

 City of Seattle - Central Area Park $350,000

 This project consists of a .33-acre greenspace, located at 24th Avenue and East Howell Street. The site will be passive-use open space. The properties were once part of a larger site owned by William Grose, one of Seattle's African-American Pioneers. His former home is located across the street from the proposed park and it is considered to be the Central Area's oldest continuously occupied house.

 City of Seattle - Duwamish/Georgetown Waterfront $65,000

 This .27-acre site is located on 8th Avenue South at the Duwamish Waterway and provides additional waterfront access on the Duwamish. The site contains high-tide marshland that can be restored by removing fill material and retaining walls to provide critical salmonid inter-tidal zone habitat in the Waterway.

 City of Seattle - Ercolini (SW Alaska Street) Park $260,000

 This half-acre green space is located on SW Alaska Street and 48th Avenue Southwest, just west of the West Seattle Junction Hub Urban Village. This green space will be a passive-use open space.

 City of Seattle - Fremont Peak Park $100,000

 Acquisition of a .43-acre site between Palatine Avenue North, First Avenue Northwest and south of North 45th Street. The site has an excellent 180-degree view of the Lake Union Ship Canal, downtown Seattle, Mount Rainier, Puget Sound and the Olympic Mountains in the distance.

 City of Seattle - Greenwood Park $200,000

 This project will help fund the land portion of up to four inholdings totaling .31 acres within Greenwood Park, located on Fremont Avenue at North 88th Street. Each of the inholding properties contains a house, the value of which will not be purchased with Conservation Futures Funds. The park may provide a children's play space in conjunction with the Seattle Boy's and Girls Club, which is located across from the Park.

 City of Seattle - Maple Leaf Community Garden $200,000

 This project is currently a vacant lot, located at Northeast 103rd Street and 5th Avenue Northeast in the Northgate Urban Village. The project will include a community garden on the site and possibly other elements such as a children's play area, to be determined through a community design process.

 City of Seattle - Northgate Park $300,000

 This project is located at 5th Avenue Northeast and 105th Avenue Northeast, and consists of the purchase of the southerly 1.67 acres of a 3.55-acre, two-lot assembly on the east side of the Northgate neighborhood. The property is currently a paved parking lot and these Conservation Futures funds will be released to the City after the parking lot has been removed.

 City of Seattle - Pinehurst Park $75,000

 Located at Northeast 117th Street and 19th Avenue Northeast, this project will provide a small pedestrian-oriented open space in a highly developed neighborhood with no public open space. The site has a view of Mount Rainier and the Cascade Range and contains many mature evergreen trees and many native plants.

 City of Seattle - Thornton Creek Park #2 $200,000

 This project consists of the acquisition of an almost-one-acre property at Northeast 100th Street near Lake City Way. The property contains small structures that will be removed, made available for salvage, or demolished. The creek bed on this site, currently contained in a narrow rock-lined corridor, will be restored to a more natural riparian condition, including a meandering streambed, pools and streamside native vegetation.

 City of Seattle - Whittier Park $265,000

 This project is located at 6th Avenue Northwest and Northwest 76th Street and is intended to create a passive open space. Part of the site is a former Seattle City Light substation property that City Light must sell at fair market value. The other parcel contains a home that will be removed. The value of structures on the site may not be funded with Conservation Futures Funds. Once in public ownership, the City will remove, salvage or demolish the house and then develop the open space.
