 AN ORDINANCE creating two alcohol impact areas and requiring a report to Council regarding voluntary efforts to reduce chronic public inebriation in such areas.

 WHEREAS, Section 314-12-215 of the Washington Administrative Code ("WAC") provides that as a condition precedent to the City requesting that the Washington State Liquor Control Board enact additional restrictions on off-premises alcohol sales within an area of the City adversely affected by chronic public inebriation or illegal activity associated with alcohol sales or consumption, an ordinance must designate such an area as an Alcohol Impact Area; and

 WHEREAS, the Washington State Liquor Control Board has previously recognized and imposed restrictions on the sale of alcohol products in the Pioneer Square Alcohol Impact Area which became effective on September 15, 2003; and

 WHEREAS, records and anecdotal information from community residents and businesses indicate that other areas of the City are increasingly adversely affected by the effects of chronic public inebriation and illegal activity associated with alcohol sales or consumption, and

 WHEREAS, an important element in the plan to reduce chronic public inebriation is to restrict the availability of alcohol sold to chronic public inebriates in areas where such sales threaten both the public's health, safety and welfare and that of the chronic public inebriates;

 Now therefore,

 BE IT ORDAINED BY THE CITY OF SEATTLE AS FOLLOWS:

 Section 1. The City Council finds:

 A. In August 2000, the City Council adopted Ordinance 120067, creating the Pioneer Square Alcohol Impact Area and instituting voluntary efforts to reduce the impacts of chronic public inebriation. Both prior to and after adoption of Ordinance 120067, all off-premises liquor licensees in the area were notified of the problems and were asked to agree to certain business practices designed to reduce chronic public inebriation and improve the public health and safety in the area, such as product restrictions, limitations on container sizes and limitations on hours of off-premises alcohol sales. By August 2002, after those voluntary restrictions proved unsuccessful, Council adopted Ordinance 120878, directing the Department of Neighborhoods and Chief of Police to ask the Washington State Liquor Control Board ("Board") to impose mandatory restrictions. The Board granted that request and imposed restrictions, effective September 15, 2003. Preliminary data and anecdotal evidence suggest that the restrictions have fostered some improvement in the Pioneer Square AIA.

 B. Residents and businesses in other neighborhoods of the City, including the International District, Capitol Hill, Judkins Park, Belltown, the University District and other residents, business owners and community organizations have appealed to the City for relief from the adverse effects of chronic public inebriation and illegal activity associated with alcohol sales and consumption in their neighborhoods.

 C. Chronic public inebriation and illegal activity associated with alcohol sales and consumption within the neighborhoods described in this ordinance have contributed to the deterioration of the general quality of life within those neighborhoods and threaten the welfare, health, peace and safety of visitors and occupants, as demonstrated by relevant crime statistics, police reports, emergency response data, citizen complaints and other information.

 D. The City of Seattle has joined with King County and others in devising and implementing a comprehensive strategy to reduce chronic public inebriation and help those dependent on alcohol. Key elements of that strategy include a joint City/County housing plan for special populations, opening of the Dutch Shisler Sobering Center, a Crisis Triage Unit at Harborview Medical Center, integrated mental health and chemical dependency services, a Mental Health Crisis Intervention Team within the Seattle Police Department, an employment training component, and expanded Emergency Services Patrol and sobering services.

 E. Significant problems associated with chronic public inebriation persist in the two areas of the City described in this ordinance as the Central Core Alcohol Impact Area and the North Alcohol Impact Area. Although the two areas are relatively small, comprising only about 8% of the total area of the City, they represent a disproportionate percentage of the alcohol-related calls to police and fire departments, including approximately 55% of alcohol-related medical incidents and approximately 80% of calls for drinking in public. Designating these areas as AIAs and initiating voluntary efforts to combat chronic public inebriation are essential tools in the overall effort to remedy this problem.

 F. Like Seattle, the City of Tacoma went through a similar voluntary process that also was unsuccessful. In December 2001, the Board designated as an Alcohol Impact Area the urban core of the City of Tacoma, which encompasses approximately six square miles. The Board banned the sale of approximately 30 brands of high-alcohol content, low priced beer and wine products by liquor retailers located within the AIA effective March 2002.

 G. The Washington State University Social and Economic Sciences Research Center studied the effectiveness of the restrictions on alcohol sales in the Tacoma Alcohol Impact Area and concluded that the restrictions were effective in addressing the problem of chronic public inebriation. While the researchers were reluctant to attribute the improvements solely to the restrictions, they concluded that the restrictions were an important part of a community-wide effort to deal with chronic public inebriation.

 H. Upon designation of the Central Core Alcohol Impact Area and the North Alcohol Impact Area by this ordinance, the Department of Neighborhoods will initiate a six-month long voluntary process to reduce the negative impacts of chronic public inebriation in both AIAs. Specifically, the Department of Neighborhoods will continue to notify licensees in both AIAs of the chronic public inebriation problem in the areas and will request that licensees, with input from community residents, businesses, and consumers, agree to business practices designed to reduce chronic public inebriation that will improve the public health and safety in the area. These may include, but are not limited to, one or more of the following: restrictions on the sale of certain alcohol products, limitations on container sizes, reduced hours of off-premises sales, and restrictions on single can sales. At the conclusion of the voluntary process, the Department of Neighborhoods shall report back to the City Council's Housing, Human Services & Health Committee in accordance with Section 2B of this ordinance.

The report shall include crime statistics, police reports, emergency medical response data, detoxification reports, sanitation reports, public health records and other information which documents the success or failure of efforts to address chronic public inebriation issues in the alcohol impact areas.
