 AN ORDINANCE relating to Seattle Transportation; increasing an expenditure allowance in the 2002 Budget of Seattle Transportation to pay for petroleum pipeline consultants, and making a reimbursable transfer of cash from the Emergency Subfund; all by a three-fourths vote of the City Council.

 WHEREAS, The City of Seattle's ("City") previous petroleum pipeline franchise agreement terminated on December 31, 2000; and

 WHEREAS, time is of the essence as it is the City's goal to successfully negotiate and complete a new petroleum pipeline franchise agreement by the end of 2002 because the petroleum pipeline operator is currently operating the pipeline without a franchise agreement; and

 WHEREAS, the City expects to retain, as consultants, experts with technical, operational, and legal knowledge of the current and past petroleum pipeline operators and franchise agreements, first-hand field experience with operating petroleum pipelines, and general insight into Western Washington's main petroleum pipeline which supplies the Seattle lateral pipeline;

 NOW THEREFORE,

 BE IT ORDAINED BY THE CITY OF SEATTLE AS FOLLOWS:

 Section 1. In order to pay for necessary costs and expenses to be incurred in 2002 to retain experts with technical, operational and legal knowledge of petroleum pipelines, but for which insufficient appropriations were made, the appropriation for the following Line of Business in the 2002 Budget of Seattle Transportation is increased as follows:

 Fund Line of Business Amount Transportation Operating Traffic and Street Use $250,000.00 Subfund (10310) Management (18001)

 The associated cash transfer authorized in Section 2 of this ordinance supports this additional appropriation.

 Section 2. To support the appropriation made in Section 1 above, cash is hereby transferred from the Emergency Subfund of the General Fund to the Transportation Operating Subfund of the Transportation Fund, as shown in the following table:

 Fund Amount Transferred Transportation Operating Subfund (10310) $250,000.00 transferred in Emergency Subfund (00185) $250,000.00 transferred out

 Section 3. No funds shall be spent from the appropriation made in Section 1 above until Seattle Transportation has retained the petroleum pipeline consultants. Any portion of the appropriation made in Section 1 above that is unexpended at the end of 2002 shall lapse, and any cash transferred from the Emergency Subfund to the Transportation Operating Subfund in support of that unexpended appropriation shall be transferred back to the Emergency Subfund.

 Section 4. The cash transfer made from the Emergency Subfund to the Transportation Operating Subfund in Section 2 above shall be reimbursed to the maximum extent possible from the proceeds of funds received as payment of franchise fees from the pipeline franchise agreement, less any monies transferred back to the Emergency Subfund under Section 3 above. Such funds from the franchise fees, when received, are hereby accepted for such purposes and shall be deposited into the Emergency Subfund.

 Section 5. Any action taken consistent with the authority and prior to the effective date of this ordinance is hereby ratified and confirmed.

 Section 6. The foregoing appropriation is made to meet actual necessary expenditures of the City for which insufficient appropriation has been made due to causes which could not reasonably have been foreseen at the time of the making of the 2002 Budget, in accordance with RCW 35.32A.060.

 Section 7. This ordinance shall take effect and be in force thirty (30) days from and after its approval by the Mayor, but if not approved and returned by the Mayor within ten (10) days after presentation, it shall take effect as provided by Municipal Code Section 1.04.020.
