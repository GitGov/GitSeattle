 BE IT ORDAINED BY THE CITY OF SEATTLE AS FOLLOWS:

 Section 1. Seattle Municipal Code Section 3.35.060, as last amended by Ordinance 120985, is hereby amended as follows:

 SMC 3.35.060 Garden plot fee schedule; permits

A. To partially offset the costs of the P-Patch program, the Director of the Department of Neighborhoods ("Director") is authorized to establish and collect fees for applications for, and for the use of, P-Patch garden plots and to grant revocable permits for such use. ~~Subject to adjustments authorized in this section, f~~Fees shall include an application fee~~be~~and a permit fee. The permit fee shall vary~~established~~ in accordance with the size of garden plot used by the program participant~~s~~ and shall ~~be as follows:~~generally be based on a standard unit of one hundred square feet. Beginning January 1, 2004, the base application fee shall be Twenty Dollars ($20) per year for any size plot, and the base permit fee shall be Ten Dollars ($10) per year for each standard unit or any part of a standard unit.These initial base fees shall be subject to adjustments as authorized in subsections B, C and D of this section. The Director may waive fees and allow reductions from base fees as authorized in subsections E and F of this section.

~~A. Ten (10) foot by ten (10) foot plots, Twenty-five Dollars ($25) per year;~~B. Ten (10) foot by twenty (20) foot plots, Thirty-eight Dollars ($38) per year;

 C. Ten (10) foot by forty (40) foot plots, Fifty-eight Dollars ($58) per year.

B. The Director shall adjust the base fees every two (2) years approximately in proportion to the change in the Consumer Price Index, All Urban Consumers, published by the federal government, or a substitute or successor index selected by the Director. The ~~next~~first such adjustment shall take effect January 1, 2005.

C. The Director also may increase base fees for any year to reflect actual or expected increases in operating costs, including but not limited to water, lease fees, or equipment maintenance, provided that neither the base application fee nor the base permit fee for a standard unit shall vary by more than five per cent (5%) from the respective fee that would apply under subsections A and B of this section.

D. The Director may establish reduced base application fees or base permit fees , or both,for plots substantially smaller than a standard unit, including accessible raised beds,~~with different dimensions than those set forth above,~~so long as the total base fees~~at a rate~~ per square foot  are no less than an amount generally consistent with the total base fees per square foot~~rate~~ for the standard unit. ~~plot most nearly equal in size, as established under this section. For participants from households with incomes at or below the poverty level as defined by the federal government, the fee for any size plot shall be Five Dollars ($5), subject to cost of living adjustment as stated in this section.~~

E. The Director may accept a reduced permit fee from a participant who is given access to a plot after a significant portion of the growing season has expired, prorated to reflect the number of months remaining in the growing season.

F. The Director may waive application fees or permit fees, or both, or set reduced fees, for plots used by low-income persons, and for organizations using plots dedicated to food bank gardening, otherwise operated to benefit low-income persons, or dedicated to educational purposes. If the Director waives or reduces fees under this section, the Director shall adopt policies regarding the income levels eligible for waivers or reduced fees, the types of organizations and programs eligible for such waivers or reductions, and conditions of eligibility, consistent with the intended public purposes for such waivers and reductions. The Director may limit the amount of area for which specified waivers or reductions may be allowed in order to prevent undue impacts on the revenues of the program.

 Section 2. The City Council finds that the new fee structure authorized in Section 1 of this ordinance, which is expected to increase revenues by approximately ten thousand dollars ($10,000) in 2004, is necessary to cover the estimated increased costs of water due to rate increases and the increased number of P-Patches.

 Section 3. Nothing in this ordinance shall affect P-Patch fees for periods ending earlier than January 1, 2004. Subject to the foregoing, this ordinance shall take effect and be in force thirty (30) days from and after its approval by the Mayor, but if not approved and returned by the Mayor within ten (10) days after presentation, it shall take effect as provided by Municipal Code Section 1.04.020.

 Passed by the City Council the ____ day of _________, 2003, and signed by me in open session in authentication of its passage this _____ day of __________, 2003.
