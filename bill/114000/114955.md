 AMENDMENT NUMBER 1 PUBLIC WORKS TRUST FUND LOAN AGREEMENT NUMBER PW-5-93-280-044 BETWEEN THE PUBLIC WORKS BOARD AND CITY OF SEATTLE

 WHEREAS, the Public Works Board (hereinafter referred to as BOARD) is authorized to make loans to local governments pursuant to the provisions of Chapters 43.155 and 39.69 of the Revised Code of Washington, as supplemented and amended; and

 WHEREAS, the City of Seattle (hereinafter referred to as LOCAL GOVERNMENT) desires to amend Loan Agreement Number PW-5-93-280-044; and

 WHEREAS, consistent with its governmental purposes, the BOARD has an established program of lending money to local governments that, among other things, is intended to (i) minimize borrowing costs to local governments, (ii) operate with low administrative burdens on the BOARD and local governments, (iii) ensure future participation by local governments in the program and (iv) provide reasonable loan security for the BOARD and its funds; and

 WHEREAS, the BOARD's standard loan agreements contain provisions (the "Acceleration Provisions") allowing the BOARD, in certain circumstances, to declare the entire remaining balance of a loan made thereunder, together with accrued interest, immediately due and payable; and

 WHEREAS, various local government borrowers under the BOARD's programs believe that the Acceleration Provisions increase the cost of incurring indebtedness with a lien senior to that of the BOARD's loans and have requested that the BOARD either modify the loan agreements to remove the Acceleration Provisions or otherwise agree not to exercise the Acceleration Provisions; and

 WHEREAS; the BOARD, after receiving the analysis of its staff and advisors, has determined that the Acceleration Provisions have increased borrowing costs for certain borrowers and are likely to increase such costs in the future; and

 WHEREAS, the BOARD has rarely invoked acceleration as a remedy against the borrowers under its loan programs, has various other rights under the loan agreements following a default by a borrower and operates its programs without requirements that may be associated with a leveraged loan program; and

 WHEREAS, consistent with its program of lending, the BOARD desires to minimize the impact of its loan agreements on the borrowing costs of local governments and to increase demand for its loans; and

 WHEREAS, existing remedies contained within the loan agreements, together with clarifications of certain of the BOARD's existing rights in relation to other creditors, provide protection to the BOARD and its funds which the BOARD deems sufficient in light of its desire to decrease borrowing costs for local governments; and

 WHEREAS, on February 4, 2003 the BOARD modified its form loan agreements by removing acceleration provisions and adding provisions clarifying the existing right of the BOARD to notify a borrowers other creditors upon an event of default or other failure to comply with a loan agreement; and

 WHEREAS, consistent with its program of lending, the BOARD desires that its loan provisions be generally consistent and, therefore, desires to amend its existing loan agreements to conform to the modifications of its form loan agreements; and

 WHEREAS, the BOARD has lent funds to the LOCAL GOVERNMENT and the LOCAL GOVERNMENT is authorized to enter into loan agreements with the BOARD pursuant to the provisions of Chapter 39.69 of the Revised Code of Washington, as supplemented and amended; and

 WHEREAS, the execution and delivery of this Amendment has been duly authorized pursuant to proper action of the BOARD and of the governing body of the LOCAL GOVERNMENT; and

 WHEREAS, all acts, conditions and things required by law to exist, to have happened and to have been performed precedent to and in connection with the execution and delivery of this Amendment, have happened and have been performed in regular and due time, form and manner as required by law, and the parties hereto are now duly authorized to execute, deliver and perform their respective obligations under this Amendment;

 NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the mutual covenants and agreements contained herein and for other valuable consideration, the sufficiency of which is hereby acknowledged, the BOARD and the LOCAL GOVERNMENT agree to amend Public Works Trust Fund Loan Agreement Number PW-5-93-280-044 as described below:

 Section 4.05 Time of Performance is amended to delete the original section and replace it with the following:

In the event of extenuating circumstances, the LOCAL GOVERNMENT may request, in writing, that the BOARD extend the deadline for project completion. The BOARD may, by a two-thirds vote, extend the deadline.

 The term of this agreement shall be for the entire term of the loan, irrespective of actual project completion, unless terminated sooner as provided herein.
