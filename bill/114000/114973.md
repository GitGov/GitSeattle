 Section 1. Subject to terms and conditions of this ordinance, permission is hereby granted to the First & Utah Street Associates, L.P.

The permit granted hereby is subject to use by the public for pedestrian travel, emergency vehicle access and utility purposes.

 Section 2. The permission herein granted to the Permittee, its successors and assigns, shall be for a term of term of ten (10) years, commencing on the effective date of this ordinance and terminating at 11:59 p.m. on the last day of the tenth year. Upon written application of the Permittee at least thirty (30) days before expiration of the term, the Director of Seattle Transportation shall renew the permit for successive ten (10) year terms, unless the City Council determines pursuant to Section 3.A below that the area subject to this permit is necessary for a primary or secondary public use or benefit, or that Permittee's improvements interfere with a primary or secondary public use or benefit. The total term of the permission as originally granted and thus extended shall not exceed thirty (30) years, subject to the right of City Council by ordinance to revise any of the terms and conditions contained herein at the time of each renewal.

 Section 3. The permit granted hereby is subject to primary and secondary use by the public of the right-of-way for travel and utility purposes, and the City expressly reserves the right to require the Permittee to remove the open space improvements in the event that

 (A) the City Council determines, by ordinance, that the space occupied by the open space improvements is necessary for any primary or secondary public use or benefit, or that the improvements interfere with any primary or secondary public use or benefit, or

 (B) the Director of Transportation ("Director") determines that any term or condition of this ordinance has been violated, and such violation has not been corrected by the Permittee after notice of violation having been given by the City.

 A City Council determination that the space is necessary for a primary or secondary public use or benefit shall be conclusive and final.

 Section 4. In the event that the permission hereby granted extends to its termination in thirty (30) years, or the City orders removal of the open space improvements pursuant to the terms of this ordinance, then within ninety (90) days after such expiration, termination or order of removal, or prior to the date stated in an "Order to Remove", as the case may be, the Permittee shall remove the open space improvements and shall return all portions of the right-of-way that may have been disturbed for any part of the improvements, back to the condition for public use as it was prior to construction of the improvements, and in at least as good condition in all respects as the abutting portions thereof and consistent with the Restoration Plan set forth in Attachment A. Whereupon, the Director shall issue a certificate discharging the Permittee from responsibility under this ordinance for occurrences after the date of such discharge.

 Section 5. The Permittee shall not commence reconstruction, relocation, readjustment or repair of the open space improvements except under the supervision of, and in strict accordance with plans and specifications approved by the Director. The Director in her/his judgment may order such reconstruction, relocation, readjustment or repair of the open space improvements at the Permittee's own cost and expense subject to the provisions of Section 8 of this ordinance, because of the deterioration or unsafe condition of the open space improvements, or the installation, construction, reconstruction, maintenance, operation or repair of any and all municipally owned public utilities, or for any other cause.

 Section 6.

In a situation in which there is an immediate threat to the health or safety of the public, notice is not required.

 Section 7. Notwithstanding termination or expiration of the permission granted, or closure or removal of the open space improvements, the Permittee shall remain bound by its obligation under this ordinance until:

 (A) the area is left in a manner as required by Section 4 and

 (B) the Director certifies that the Permittee has discharged its obligation herein.

 Provided, that upon prior notice to the Permittee and entry of written findings that such is in the public interest, the Director may, in her/his sole discretion, excuse the Permittee, conditionally or absolutely, from compliance with all or any of the Permittee's obligation to remove the open space improvements and restore disturbed areas.

 Section 8. The permission granted by this permit is subject to the protection, support or relocation of existing utilities deemed necessary by the owner of the utility and shall be done at Permittee's expense with the Permittee being responsible for any subsequent damage to the utilities due to construction, maintenance or operation of the open space improvements. Whenever a utility needs to excavate within the street area subject to this permit, the Director will require the utility to restore, at its own expense, the pavement or other street area excavated in accordance with the City's Pavement Opening and Restoration Rules and with applicable Seattle Standard Plans and Specifications; provided, however, that if the utility's excavation has disturbed or removed Permittee's open space improvements, the utility shall not be required to be responsible for any additional cost incurred as a result of the open space improvements costing more than the applicable Seattle Standard Plans and Specifications for street surface restoration . Such additional restoration costs shall be the sole responsibility of the Permittee. If Permittee desires surface restoration with decorative or special paving materials, Permittee shall furnish such materials to the utility. Prior to commencement of any pavement opening work in the street area subject to this permit, the Director will require the utility to consult with the Permittee on the means for minimizing interference with the Permittee's use of the street, and the utility's restoration plan and schedule.

 (A) the City, its agents, contractors, or employees; and

 (B) the Permittee, its agents, contractors, employees or its successors or assigns, this indemnity provision shall be valid and enforceable only to the extent of the negligence of the Permittee or Permittee's agents, contractors, employees or its successors or assigns.
