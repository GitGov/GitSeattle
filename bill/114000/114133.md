The Chief of the Fire Department is hereby authorized to enter into an agreement with the Medic One Foundation for funds in the amount of Forty Thousand Two Hundred Sixty-seven Dollars and Seventy-one Cents ($40,267.71) for the purpose of fully supporting a position responsible for monitoring 911 call responses. The money, when received, shall be deposited into the General Subfund of the General Fund as reimbursement for the appropriation made in Section 2 of this ordinance.

 Section 2. The expenditure allowance for the Operations Line of Business in the 2002 Adopted Budget of the Fire Department is increased by Forty Thousand Two Hundred Sixty-seven Dollars and Seventy-one Cents ($40,267.71) by the appropriation, hereby made and authorized, of a like sum from the General Subfund of the General Fund. Any portion of the above appropriation unexpended at the end of 2002 shall not lapse but shall be carried into future budget years until fully expended or abandoned by ordinance.

 Section 3. Any act consistent with the authority and prior to the effective date of this ordinance is hereby ratified and confirmed.
