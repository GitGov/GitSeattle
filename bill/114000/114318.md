 AN ORDINANCE reducing the appropriation of the 2002 Purchased Power & Transmission Program within the Power Supply Line of Business of Seattle City Light and reappropriating an equal amount to the Power System Management Program within the Power Supply Line of Business of Seattle City Light.

 WHEREAS, Section 10(e) of the Federal Power Act and the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1986, provides that the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) "will assess reasonable annual charges against licensees and exemptees for the costs of administration of the Commission's hydropower regulatory program" (18 CFR 11.1); and

 WHEREAS, Section 10 (e) (1) of the Federal Power Act further authorizes FERC to collect costs assessed by other federal agencies (OFAs) that relate to hydropower licensees; and

 WHEREAS, Seattle City Light successfully joined with other utilities to challenge the OFA portion of the FERC administrative fees from 1995-1999 resulting in a $845,954 2001 credit for past OFA charges; and

 WHEREAS, Seattle City Light will again be paying the OFA portion of the 2002 FERC Administrative Fee under protest and joining with other utilities to challenge the 2000 - 2002 OFA charges; and

 WHEREAS, the 2002 annual bill for the FERC Administrative Fees is higher than the amount originally budgeted; and

 WHEREAS, the 2002 purchased power budget costs are expected to be significantly lower than the adopted budget due to lower wholesale power market prices, and

 WHEREAS, City Council Resolution No. 27726 provides that Seattle City Light will continue its past practice of not transferring its purchased power and transmission budget authority to other areas of the budget; and

 WHEREAS, the reduction in the power budget and the reappropriation of an equal amount of budget authority is consistent with City Council Resolution No. 27726; and

 WHEREAS, reducing the power budget by $304,761 and reappropriating the same amount to the non-power budget will not change the Department's total 2002 budget authority; NOW, THEREFORE,

 BE IT ORDAINED BY THE CITY OF SEATTLE AS FOLLOWS:

 Section 1. In order to pay for necessary costs and expenses incurred or to be incurred in 2002, but for which insufficient appropriations were made, the City authorizes the reduction of the Purchased Power & Transmission Program in the Power Supply Line of Business of Seattle City Light by $304,761 and the reappropriation of the same amount to the Power System Management Program in the same line of business.

 Section 2. All acts taken prior to the effective date and consistent with the authority of this ordinance are hereby ratified and confirmed.

 Section 3. This ordinance shall take effect and be in force thirty (30) days from and after its approval by the Mayor, but if not approved and returned by the Mayor within ten (10) days after presentation, it shall take effect as provided by Municipal Code Section 1.04.020.
