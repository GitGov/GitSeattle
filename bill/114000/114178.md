 SEWER EASEMENT MODIFICATION AGREEMENT

 This Sewer Easement Modification Agreement (the "Agreement") is made and entered into as of the ___ day of ______, 2002, by and among The City of Seattle, a municipal corporation of the State of Washington, acting by and through Seattle Public Utilities (the "City" or "Grantee") and U Village Imp. Limited Partnership and U Village Land Limited Partnership, each a Washington limited partnership (together, "U Village" or "Grantor"). The City and U Village are sometimes referred to collectively as the "Parties."

 RECITALS

 A. U Village Imp. Limited Partnership and U Village Land Limited Partnership together own the land and improvements located on the property in Seattle described in Exhibit A hereto (the "U Village Property").

 B. Pursuant to instruments recorded under King County Recording No. 4651607 and 4651608 (the "Sewer Easements"), attached hereto as Exhibit B, the City has been granted easements in the portion of the U Village Property described in the Sewer Easements (the "Existing Facilities Area") in which sewer facilities (the "Existing Facilities") are located and are operating. The location of the Existing Facilities is generally depicted in Exhibit C and the location of the Existing Facilities Area is generally depicted in Exhibit D.

 C. In connection with the continued development of the U Village Property, U Village desires to construct a structure, as described in Master Use Permit No. 2002354, consisting of a parking garage ("Garage") and retail unit, (collectively, the "Private Improvements"), as shown in Exhibit E-1, over a portion of the Existing Facilities. The Parties have determined that the best way to accomplish the development of the Private Improvements and to protect the City's interests is for U Village to relocate and replace the affected portion of the Existing Facilities (the "Build Over Facilities") with a new sewer facility and necessary appurtenances (the "Relocated Facilities") approximately 28 feet west of the Build Over Facilities, all as shown in Exhibit C. As shown in Exhibit C, (i) the north end of the Relocated Facilities shall be connected to a side sewer (the "UW Facilities") owned by the Board of Regents of the University of Washington ("UW") and serving University of Washington student housing pursuant to side sewer agreement dated __________, 2002 between U Village and UW (the "UW Side Sewer Agreement") and (ii) the south end of the Relocated Facilities shall be connected to the Existing Facilities. Pursuant to the UW Side Sewer Agreement, the connection described in clause (i) of the preceding sentence shall replace the connection between the current UW side sewer and the Build Over Facilities. The Parties recognize that the City requires access to the north and south ends of the Relocated Facilities for maintenance, repair, alteration and reconstruction of the Relocated Facilities.

 D. The Parties have entered into a Consent Agreement dated as of April 11, 2002 that sets forth certain requirements for construction and installation of the Relocated Facilities and disconnection of the Build Over Facilities (the "Consent Agreement"). The City has issued Sewer Permit No. 020372 (the "Sewer Permit") with regard to same. Pursuant to the Consent Agreement, U Village has delivered and the City has accepted the UW Side Sewer Agreement.

 E. The Parties are entering into this Agreement to amend the Sewer Easements to reflect their aforesaid intent by relocating the easement areas of, and modifying certain terms in, the Sewer Easements. The Parties also are entering into this Agreement to provide for the transfer of the Build Over Facilities to U Village.

 Now, therefore, in consideration of the mutual promises contained herein, the Parties agree as follows:

 AGREEMENT

 1. Amendment of Sewer Easements Effective as of the date that (i) U Village has completed construction of the Relocated Facilities, has connected them to the Existing Facilities and the UW Facilities, and has fulfilled all requirements of the Consent Agreement and the Sewer Permit, (ii) the City has conducted all required inspections with respect to the Relocated Facilities and (iii) and the City has accepted the Relocated Facilities (the "Amendment Date"), the Sewer Easements set forth in Exhibit B shall be deemed automatically amended, without any further action by the Parties, as follows:

 (a) The term "party of the first part" shall be replaced with "Grantor" and the term "party of the second part" shall be replaced with "Grantee."

 (b) The easement area described in each of the Sewer Easements shall be replaced with the following:

In such event, Grantee shall have no rights or liabilities hereunder or under the Sewer Easements with respect to the Garage Access Area or the Perimeter Access Area.

 4. Transfer of Build Over Facilities. Effective as of the Amendment Date and without any further action of the Parties, the City shall be deemed to automatically transfer, sell, convey, assign and quitclaim without warranty all of its right, title and interest in the Build Over Facilities to U Village, and thereafter the City shall have no rights, responsibilities or liabilities with regard to said facilities.

Solely for the purpose of effectuating the foregoing indemnity and not for the benefit of Grantor's employees or any third parties, Grantor expressly waives any immunity that may be granted under the Washington State Industrial Insurance Act, Title 51 RCW. U Village and the City acknowledge that the foregoing waiver of Title 51 immunity was specifically negotiated. If a court of competent jurisdiction, all appeals having been exhausted, determines that RCW 4.24.115 applies to U Village's obligations under the preceding sentence, such obligations shall not exceed those permitted under said statute.

 7. Recordation. U Village shall cause this Agreement to be recorded immediately upon execution. At the request of either Party, the Parties shall execute and record notices confirming that the transactions contemplated herein, such as the Amendment Date and the release of the easements with respect to the Garage Access Area and Perimeter Access Area , have taken place, but the Parties' obligations under this sentence shall only apply with respect to those transactions that have actually taken place.

 8. Covenant Running with the Land. This Agreement shall run with the land and shall be binding on all parties now or hereafter holding or acquiring any right, title or interest in the property on which the Amended Easement Area is located.

 9. Miscellaneous. This Agreement, including recitals and exhibits (which are hereby incorporated by this reference), constitutes the entire agreement between the Parties with respect to the subject matter hereof. No modification of this Agreement may be made except by written agreement signed by each of the Parties. It is not intended that this Agreement shall create any partnership, joint venture or other similar arrangement between the City and U Village. In the event of conflict between any depiction and legal description contained in this Agreement, the legal description shall control. The provisions of this Agreement shall be construed as a whole according to their common meaning, and not strictly for or against any party, in order to achieves the objectives of the Agreement. Each of the Parties and its counsel has reviewed and revised this Agreement and agrees that the normal rules of construction to the effect that ambiguities are resolved against the drafter shall not be employed in the interpretation of this Agreement.
