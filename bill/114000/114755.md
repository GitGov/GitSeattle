 AN ORDINANCE relating to financing certain capital activities of Seattle Transportation; authorizing the creation of a City fund; and authorizing the loan of funds from the City's Consolidated (Residual) Cash Pool, or its participating funds, to the new fund.

 WHEREAS, the Mayor has proposed, and the City Council has approved, a 2004 Budget and 2004-2009 Capital Improvement Program that include preliminary activities for the Mercer Corridor Project; and

 WHEREAS, the Mayor has proposed, and the City Council has approved, a 2004 Budget and 2004-2009 Capital Improvement Program that include a three-year program beginning in 2004 to install up to 1,650 Pay Stations to replace a majority of the single-space parking meters; and

 WHEREAS, it is in the City's best interest to fund and begin implementation of the Mercer Corridor and Pay Stations projects at this time; and

 WHEREAS, there is sufficient cash in the City's Consolidated (Residual) Cash Pool or its participating funds to support a loan of up to Seven Million Dollars ($7,000,000), plus accrued interest to the 2005 Multipurpose LTGO Bond Fund (the "Bond Fund") terminating no later than September 30, 2005; and

 WHEREAS, it is anticipated that this loan will be refinanced in 2005 with general obligation bonds when the City has sufficient financing needs to warrant a bond issue, or by another internal loan if the City is not yet prepared for a bond issue at that time; NOW THEREFORE,

 BE IT ORDAINED BY THE CITY OF SEATTLE AS FOLLOWS:

 Section 1. The Director of Finance is hereby authorized to create in the City Treasury the 2005 Multipurpose LTGO Bond Fund ("Bond Fund"), from which may be paid the costs of acquiring parking Pay Stations and certain capital costs related to the Mercer Corridor project other than costs that are paid from a fund that already exists in the City Treasury.

 Section 2. A loan of up to Seven Million Dollars ($7,000,000) principal amount outstanding at any one time, plus accrued interest, is hereby authorized to be made from the City's Consolidated (Residual) Cash Pool, or its participating funds, to the Bond Fund. Said loan is to be repaid no later than September 30, 2005, with interest on the loan at the rate of return of the City's Consolidated (Residual) Cash Pool.

 Section 3. Interest owed by the Bond Fund to the City's Consolidated (Residual) Cash Pool that is allocable to the Pay Stations project will be paid monthly by the Transportation Fund out of Seattle Transportation's operating budget. To accomplish this, negative Consolidated (Residual) Cash Pool earnings for the Bond Fund attributable to the principal outstanding for the Pay Stations project shall be allocated to the Transportation Operating Fund.

 Section 4. Interest owed by the Bond Fund to the City's Consolidated (Residual) Cash Pool that is allocable to the Mercer Corridor project will accrue in the Bond Fund and be repaid either with the proceeds of limited tax general obligation bonds issued by the City or by an extension of this internal loan.

 Section 5. The entire principal amount of the loan authorized by Section 2 above shall be repaid either with the proceeds of limited tax general obligation bonds to be issued by the City or by an extension of this internal City loan. In any event, the Executive shall submit a proposed ordinance to City Council seeking authorization to extend the internal City loan or to refinance it with bond proceeds.

 Section 6. The Director of Finance may effectuate the loan authorized in Section 2 of this ordinance by transferring cash from one or more of the funds participating in the City's Consolidated (Residual) Cash Pool to the Bond Fund, or by carrying the Bond Fund in a negative cash position in an amount not to exceed Seven Million Dollars ($7,000,000) plus accrued interest at any one time, until no later than September 30, 2005.

 Section 7. All acts taken prior to the effective date and consistent with the authority of this ordinance are hereby ratified and confirmed.

 Section 8. This ordinance shall take effect and be in force thirty (30) days from and after its approval by the Mayor, but if not approved and returned by the Mayor within ten (10) days after presentation, it shall take effect as provided by Municipal Code Section 1.04.020.
