 ORDINANCE __________

 AN ORDINANCE rejecting proposed Initiative 77 and ordering that it be submitted to the qualified electors of the City at a special election to be held on November 5, 2002 together with any substitute measure dealing with the same subject enacted by the Council.

 WHEREAS, the petition signatures that caused Initiative No. 77 to qualify for introduction and consideration by the City Council were submitted to the City Clerk on August 7, 2002; and

 WHEREAS, the City Clerk forwarded the petition signatures to King County Records and Elections for validation and determination of sufficiency; and

 WHEREAS, King County Records and Elections found the petition to contain sufficient valid signatures and issued a Certificate of Sufficiency to the City Clerk on August 12, 2002; and

 WHEREAS, pursuant to the City Charter, Article IV, Section 1. B, the City Clerk presented the City Clerk's Report and Certificate of Sufficiency to the City Council at its regular meeting on August 12, 2002 in Clerk File 305171; and

 WHEREAS, the City Council accepted the introduction of the Clerk File and referred it to the Full Council for deliberation; and

 WHEREAS, the City now provides approximately One and a Half Million Dollars ($1,500,000) on an annual basis for childcare and early childhood education services from its voter-approved Families and Education Levy which will be considered for renewal by the voters in 2004 and may be the most appropriate vehicle for providing long-term additional funding for childcare and early childhood education services. The planning process for this Levy will begin in 2003 and would provide the forum for public discussion and review of existing services provided, unmet demand for services, and decisions regarding most appropriate programs to fund given desired outcomes; and

 WHEREAS, for the above stated reasons, the City Council has decided not to enact Initiative No. 77 and

 is considering passage of a substitute measure dealing with the same subject; and
