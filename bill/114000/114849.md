 AN ORDINANCE relating to the impoundment of vehicles, amending Sections 11.30.105 and 11.30.120 of the Seattle Municipal Code.

 WHEREAS, in 1998 the City Council passed Ordinance 119180 allowing the impoundment of vehicles driven by persons arrested for driving while license suspended or revoked (DWLS) in the first, second, or third degree; and

 WHEREAS, one of the main rationales for impounding the vehicles driven by persons arrested for DWLS is to enhance public safety; and

 WHEREAS, there is substantial evidence of significant public safety benefits from impounding vehicles of persons arrested for DWLS in the first or second degree, but as yet no compelling evidence of significant public safety benefits from impounding vehicles of persons arrested for DWLS in the third degree; and

 WHEREAS, if there is not a significant public safety benefit, the direct and indirect economic impacts on some persons of vehicle impounds exceeds the public benefits from the impound; and

 WHEREAS, the City Council therefore desires to cease impounding vehicles of persons arrested for DWLS in the third degree; and

 WHEREAS, the City Council wishes to enhance the applicability of impound as it relates to violations associated with public safety, specifically its use to impound the cars of owner-drivers arrested for DUI; and

 WHEREAS, the City Council further intends to limit the use of impound in all cases to those instances in which the driver is the owner of the vehicle;

 NOW THEREFORE,

 BE IT ORDAINED BY THE CITY OF SEATTLE AS FOLLOWS:
