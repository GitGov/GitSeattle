 ORDINANCE __________

 AN ORDINANCE relating to the protection and enhancement of Seattle's fresh water and marine aquatic habitat areas; establishing a "Seattle Aquatic Habitat Enhancement Program," as an alternative to the creek restoration program proposed in Initiative Measure No. 80, to protect and enhance in-city aquatic areas, including areas that provide habitat for threatened chinook salmon and other species; establishing criteria to guide Program implementation; creating a new subfund within the General Fund; amending SMC Chapter 5.48 to impose an additional 1% utility tax on water, drainage and waste water utilities as a dedicated funding source for implementation of the Program; providing a mechanism to promote voluntary aquatic habitat enhancement measures and allowing for the use of City matching funds for selected projects; establishing a Citizen's Oversight Committee; and providing for the submission to the qualified voters of the City at a special election to be held in conjunction with the statewide primary election in September 2003 of this measure as a substitute for Initiative Measure No.80.

 WHEREAS, many species of fish and wildlife, including Puget Sound chinook salmon (which has been listed as a threatened species under the federal Endangered Species Act), utilize aquatic habitat within the City of Seattle; and

 WHEREAS, the protection and enhancement of in-city aquatic habitat for these species is an important public concern and a City purpose; and

 WHEREAS, the City of Seattle has adopted regulations and has undertaken various programs and projects to help protect and enhance aquatic habitat for salmonids, trout and other species; and

 WHEREAS, it is in the public interest to establish a dedicated funding source for the purpose of implementing a consolidated in-city aquatic habitat enhancement program for the City of Seattle; and

 WHEREAS, the City will continue to fund and carry out existing habitat restoration and enhancement efforts at current levels of investment utilizing other City resources; and

 WHEREAS, the City Council believes that an alternative to Initiative 80 should be submitted to Seattle voters that would establish a broader aquatic habitat protection and enhancement program with a specified, dedicated funding source; and

 WHEREAS, the City Council finds that the Seattle Aquatic Habitat Enhancement Program established by this ordinance will protect and promote the health, safety and welfare of the general public,

 NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT ORDAINED BY THE CITY OF SEATTLE AS FOLLOWS:

 Section 1. Purpose.

The purpose of this ordinance is to establish and provide for the funding and implementation of the Seattle Aquatic Habitat Enhancement Program to protect and enhance in-city aquatic habitat, including habitat that may be used by threatened chinook salmon and other species of concern. This Program is established in lieu of and as an alternative to the general "creek restoration" policies and requirements proposed in Initiative 80. Under this Program, new land use regulations are not imposed and proposed creek restoration projects will be considered on a case-by-case basis together with other aquatic habitat measures, and shall be subject to a process of prioritization and review. It shall be the policy of the City to consider costs and public benefits (in terms of habitat values and other factors) in connection with all such efforts.

 Section 2. Seattle Aquatic Habitat Enhancement Program Components .

A. Within 18 months after the effective date of this measure, and following an opportunity for public review and comment, Seattle Public Utilities, in coordination with the Department of Parks and Recreation, shall implement a long-term program to protect and enhance in-city aquatic habitat, to be known as the Seattle Aquatic Habitat Enhancement Program ("Program"), in accordance with the provisions of this ordinance. The Program shall be in lieu of the Creek Restoration Plan proposed in Initiative 80 and shall contain at least the following components:

 (1) The establishment of measurable objectives for the protection and enhancement of in-city aquatic habitat, including habitat used by threatened chinook salmon and other species as appropriate;

 (2) A resource assessment that identifies key habitat features important to the protection and recovery of salmon and other species to be protected;

 (3) A six (6) year capital project and maintenance plan (to be updated every two (2) years) for an array of projects that individually and collectively are capable of being accomplished with the additional tax revenues provided for by this ordinance (together with existing funding levels for such projects), and will aid the protection and enhancement of in-city aquatic habitat consistent with one or more of the criteria specified in section 3 of this ordinance. The projects identified in section 4(A) of this ordinance shall be given priority consideration for inclusion in such plan. The Citizen's Oversight Committee shall be provided an opportunity to review and make recommendations regarding the specific projects to be included in such plan, and the final plan shall be submitted for approval through the regular City budget process;

 (4) A set of proposed voluntary guidelines and incentive-based approaches aimed at further reducing the impact on in-city aquatic habitat of public and private development, especially development occurring within 200 feet of aquatic habitat areas, including shorelines of statewide significance;

 (5) A program of public education and involvement (including both school programs and programs for property owners) related to salmon recovery and habitat protection;

 (6) A funding strategy for future Program components that may require additional monies beyond those made available through this ordinance;

 (7) A monitoring and evaluation program focused on tracking habitat project performance, accumulated progress in protecting and restoring key habitat features, and changes in the productivity of species over time in order to provide a basis for considering Program amendments;

 (8) A program that addresses intergovernmental and tribal interests and opportunities regarding the protection and enhancement of aquatic habitat within Seattle;

 (9) Additional measures to be included in the City's Integrated Pest Management efforts to further reduce any effects of pesticide, herbicide and fungicide use on in-city aquatic habitat;

 B. The Program should be compatible with regional Water Resource Inventory Area (WRIA) plans being developed pursuant to state law.

 Section 3. Implementation Guidance Criteria.

 A. In making decisions regarding specific project selection and funding levels to implement the Program, the City shall take into account the extent to which the project or action in question meets one or more of the following criteria.

 (1) Biological effectiveness, including the degree to which the project or action:

 (a) Addresses a "limiting factor" for a listed (or candidate), threatened, endangered, or state priority species or other species of concern;

 (b) Helps protect, rehabilitate or restore habitat important to the life stage of a listed (or candidate), threatened, endangered, or state priority species or other species of concern;

 (c) Contributes to an important habitat system by increasing connectivity between habitat patches, or increasing habitat complexity and distribution;

 (e) Contributes to the genetic diversity of a listed (or candidate), threatened, endangered, or state priority species or other species of concern;

 (f) Contributes to the protection or restoration of riparian areas that support habitat features important to a life stage of a listed (or candidate), threatened, endangered, or state priority species or other species of concern;

 (g) Provides a significant opportunity to advance a key research question related to the mortality or productivity of a listed (or candidate), threatened, endangered or state priority species or other species of concern, including the productivity of specific critical habitat features.

 (2) Relationship to other habitat protection/restoration plans, including the extent to which the project or action:

 (a) Enhances an adopted Habitat Conservation Plan under the Federal Endangered Species Act;

 (b) Enhances some other environmental, land use, or utility plan or action.

 (3) Likelihood of success, including the extent to which:

 (a) Costs, scope, and schedule can be determined with relative certainty;
