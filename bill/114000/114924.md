 BE IT ORDAINED BY THE CITY OF SEATTLE AS FOLLOWS:

 Section 1. Seattle Municipal Code Section 4.20.300, Payment for performance of out-of-class duties, Ordinance 98316 as amended, is hereby further amended as follows:

 A. Definitions.

~~1. "Continuous out-of-class assignment" means a regularly scheduled part-time or full-time ongoing out-of-class assignment to perform and receive compensation for the duties of the same higher-paying title.~~2

. 1. "Discretionary pay program" means a compensation program in which the appointing authority, in accordance with guidelines and procedures established by the Personnel Director, is granted discretion to set pay within the pay zone.

~~3~~2. "Hourly employee" means an employee who is compensated on an hourly basis for each hour of work performed, including time in excess of forty (40) hours per workweek.

~~4~~3. "Out-of-class assignment" means the temporary assignment of one (1) or more employees to perform the normal ongoing duties and responsibilities associated with a higher- paying title.

~~5~~4. "Proper authority" means the appointing authority or his or her designated management representative.

~~6~~5. "Salaried employee" means an employee who is not eligible for overtime and who each pay period regularly receives a predetermined amount constituting all or part of his or her compensation.

~~7~~6. "Threshold" means the amount of time an employee must perform out-of-class duties prior to being compensated for the performance of those duties. The threshold shall consist of consecutive work hours or work days. ~~The threshold must be satisfied for each out-of-class assignment.~~~~~~B. Except as otherwise provided in authorized collective bargaining agreements, qualified employees assigned by proper authority to perform the ongoing duties and accept the responsibilities of a higher-paying title in order to avoid a significant interruption of

 work or services shall be paid as provided herein while performing such duties. Each out-of-class assignment is limited to six (6) months unless an extension is authorized by the appointing

 authority, except that an out-of-class assignment to be the head of an employing unit is limited to twelve (12) months following the occurrence of a vacancy and for up to ninety (90) days after a City Council rejection of a nominee to fill the vacancy. Appropriate reasons for the assignment of out-of-class duties include:

 1. Absence of a position incumbent;

 2. Peak workload periods;

 3. Position vacancy; or

 4. Completion of a special project.

 C. An employee whose primary title is not included in a discretionary pay program may be assigned to work out-of-class in a higher-paying title that is not included in a discretionary pay

 program; or may be assigned to work out-of-class in a title that is associated with a discretionary pay program.

 1. Payment for the out-of-class assignment to a title that is not associated with a discretionary pay program shall be determined as in promotion (SMC subsection 4.20.080 B).

 2. Payment for an out-of-class assignment to a title that is associated with a discretionary pay program must use the designated out-of-class pay rates established for the particular program. Within such out-of-class pay structure, the appointing authority or designated management representative shall have discretion for placement.

 3. Cumulative hours worked in an out-of-class ~~assignment~~ title will be credited toward salary step placement in the event the employee ~~who was so assigned~~ is appointed, or his or her position reclassified, to the same title as the out-of-class assignment, within twelve (12) months of the end of such out-of-class assignment; except that hours worked in an out-of-class assignment to a title in a discretionary pay program shall not be counted toward salary placement in the event of appointment or reclassification to a title in a discretionary pay program.

 4. An employee with an~~continuous~~ out-of-class assignment to a title that is not associated with a discretionary pay program will receive a step increment each two thousand and eighty- eight (2088) straight-time hours of actual service while so assigned; provided, that he or she has not already received an increment in the out-of-class title because of increases to the primary pay rate; provided further, that such increment does not exceed the top step of the higher salary range.

 D. An employee who is regularly appointed to a position with a title included in a discretionary pay program may be assigned by proper authority to perform the duties associated with another position in the same pay zone and his or her salary temporarily adjusted in accordance with the base salary-setting rules associated with that program.

 E. An employee whose position is assigned to a discretionary pay program may be assigned by proper authority to perform the duties associated with another pay zone in the same program or with another title in a different compensation program, and compensated as provided in subsections C1 or C2 or this section.

 F. The threshold for compensation for out-of-class assignments shall be four (4) hours for hourly employees and ten (10) days for salaried employees. The threshold must be satisfied for each out-of-class assignment.

 Section 2. This ordinance shall take effect and be in force thirty (30) days from and after its approval by the Mayor, but if not approved and returned by the Mayor within ten (10) days after presentation, it shall take effect as provided by Municipal Code Section 1.04.020.
