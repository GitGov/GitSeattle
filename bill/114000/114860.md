 AN ORDINANCE relating to Seattle Public Utilities; clarifying the charges for new connections to Seattle's water distribution system, and amending Seattle Municipal Code Chapter 21.04 by repealing sections 110, 120, 130, 340, and 350, and adding three new sections 105, 115, 125, and amending section 21.04.465.

 WHEREAS, RCW 35.92.025 authorizes a municipal water utility to require properties seeking to connect to the water system to make a contribution to the system, in addition to fees charged for establishing the installation of pipes, meter, appurtenances to the system; and

 WHEREAS, properties seeking to connect to the Seattle water distribution system may contribute to the system in one of several ways, i.e., by installing a standard water main, participating in a current Utility Local Improvement District project for a water main installation, contributing to a developer who is installing a water main, or paying a cash contribution to the Seattle Public Utilities; and

 WHEREAS, as a result of these different methods of paying or deferring a connection charge to the water distribution system, there can be different relationships between the existing connections on a substandard part of the distribution system; and

 WHEREAS, there is consequently a need to clarify the applicability of connection charges in different circumstances; Now Therefore,

 BE IT ORDAINED BY THE CITY OF SEATTLE AS FOLLOWS:

 Section 1. Seattle Municipal Code Sections 21.04.110, 21.04.120, 21.04.130, 21.04.340, and 21.04.350 are hereby repealed.

 Section 2. A new section of the Seattle Municipal Code is added to Chapter 21.04 to read as follows:

 21.04.105 Connection Charge

 A. In addition to water service installation fees and charges required by ordinance or administrative rule, the owner of a property seeking either for the first time to connect that property to the water distribution system for any water purposes, or to expand existing water service shall pay a Connection Charge prior to connection.

 B. A property may be exempt from paying the Connection Charge in circumstances where an equivalent contribution is made at the time the owner of the property is seeking to connect or reconnect to the water system, such as the construction of a water main accepted by Seattle Public Utilities as part of its distribution system. Any such exemptions for equivalent contributions shall be defined in Seattle Public Utilities Policy and Procedure, which may be amended from time to time by the Director.

 C. The collection of a Connection Charge to serve a single family residence may be deferred with interest at the request of an owner who meets both of the following criteria: (1) is economically disadvantaged, as defined in Section 20.12.020 B of the Seattle Municipal Code; and (2) also owns and occupies the residence which will be connected to the water distribution system. Interest on the principal will be calculated at the rate of 150 basis points (1.5%) added to the yield for 10-year U.S. Treasury Constant Securities (e.g., if the yield is 5.02%, the interest charge would be 6.52%). The interest rate shall be fixed for the duration of contract, using the Treasury yield for the most current month listed on the Federal Reserve's internet website, www.federalreserve.gov/releases/h15/data.htm#fnl13, or successor website, or other source. The rate will be determined at the time the finance contract is signed by the property owner. Such contract shall provide that any unpaid balance may be paid off in full at any time. All charges, including interest so deferred, shall become a lien against the property and shall be recorded by the Director of Seattle Public Utilities in the office of the County Recorder at the expense of the property owner, and such deferred payment shall be due and payable in full at the time of sale or transfer of the property or at the time the property ceases to be used as a single family residence.

 Section 3. A new section of the Seattle Municipal Code is added to Chapter 21.04 to read as follows:

 21.04.115 Payment of Connection Charge

 The Connection Charge shall be paid either in cash, or under an installment contract. An installment contract shall provide for a down payment of a minimum of one-fortieth (1/40) of the total Connection Charge, payable upon execution of such contract and for payment of the balance in equal installments of the unpaid balance payable at specified intervals throughout the term of the contract, together with interest as provided in this section. Interest on the principal will be calculated at the rate of 150 basis points (1.5%) added to the yield for 10-year U.S. Treasury Constant Securities (e.g., if the yield is 5.02%, the interest charge would be 6.52%). The interest rate shall be fixed for the duration of contract, using the Treasury yield for the most current month listed on the Federal Reserve's internet website, www.federalreserve.gov/releases/h15/data.htm#fnl13, or successor website, or other source. The rate will be determined at the time the finance contract is signed by the property owner. Such installment contract shall be no more than ten years in duration and shall provide that any unpaid balance may be paid off in full at any time. Such contract shall include a provision that in the event of failure to pay the required installments, the Director of Seattle Public Utilities may disconnect the City's water service from and refuse to supply water to the premises until the unpaid installments are paid. In addition, the installment contract shall become a lien against the property and shall be recorded by the Director of Seattle Public Utilities in the office of the County Recorder at the expense of the property owner, and such deferred payment shall be due and payable in full at the time of sale or transfer of the property.

 Section 4. A new section of the Seattle Municipal Code is added to Chapter 21.04 to read as follows:

 21.04.125 Calculation of the Connection Charge

 The Connection Charge shall be calculated as the product of Connection Charge Units (CCU) and Connection Charge Unit Rate (CCUR). The CCU is a measure of the size of the new water service connection or connections or the increase in the size of an existing connection or connections. The CCU is the aggregation of the new retail service connections being requested by the owner (or the requested connections for existing services) weighted by their hydraulic capacities and expressed as a multiple of a single 3/4-inch domestic service connection. The CCUR represents the equity value of the water system, as represented by the total asset value of the system less the value of outstanding bonds as detailed in the Water Fund's annual financial statement, attributable to a single customer with a 3/4-inch service. Measurement of the CCU and administration of the Connection Charge will conform to adopted Departmental Policy and Procedure.

 Section 5. Seattle Municipal Code Section 21.04.465, as last amended by Ordinance 119267, is amended as follows:

 SMC 21.04.465 Standard , connection, and administrative charges.

 A. The Director shall develop and update annually a schedule of charges for standard, recurring services which are incidental to the sale of water. Such charges shall be based on a review of the prevailing actual costs for providing these services.

 B. The Director shall develop and update annually the Connection Charge Unit Rate (CCUR). Updates to the CCUR shall make use of the most recent audited financial statements for the water system.

~~B~~C. The Director may establish reasonable administrative charges for handling dishonored checks, money orders, or other instruments; fees for turning water on or off; charges for delinquent accounts and for related field visits; charges for meter tests, hydrant flow tests, and hydrant use; fees for customer statements of prior billings; charges for utility crossing permits; and for other services not encompassed in the schedule of standard charges.

~~C~~D. Any standard charges, including administrative charges, shall be developed and adopted pursuant to the provisions of the Administrative Code (Seattle Municipal Code Chapter 3.02, Ordinance 102228, as amended).

~~D~~E. Administrative charges and interest rates developed and adopted pursuant to subsection ~~C~~D of this section shall apply to all delinquent sewer and solid waste charges that are assessed through the combined utility bill; provided that interest rates shall not exceed the maximum rate allowed by law. See RCW 35.67.200.

 Section 6. This ordinance shall take effect and be in force thirty (30) days from and after its approval by the Mayor, but if not approved and returned by the Mayor within ten (10) days after presentation, it shall take effect as provided by Municipal Code Section 1.04.020.
