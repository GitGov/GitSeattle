 ORDINANCE _________________

 AN ORDINANCE relating to the development of a monorail transportation system within The City of Seattle; proposing and providing for the submission to the qualified electors of The City of Seattle, at an election to be held on November 5, 2002, of a ballot measure: creating a city transportation authority, with a nine-member board, to plan, finance, build, acquire, complete, operate, charge for, and maintain a monorail system in the City of Seattle; authorizing the imposition of a special excise tax of up to 1.4 percent on the value of every motor vehicle owned by a resident of the Authority Area for the privilege of using a motor vehicle to provide initial funding for a monorail system; establishing an interim board and then a permanent board to govern the authority following approval by the voters of the creation of the authority; and repealing City of Seattle Initiative 41 and City of Seattle Initiative 53.

 WHEREAS, in 1997 voters in The City of Seattle (the "City") passed Initiative 41, establishing the Elevated Transportation Company ("ETC"), which was to study and make recommendations for the construction of a significantly expanded monorail mass transit system in the City; and

 WHEREAS, in 2000 Seattle voters passed Initiative 53/Proposition 2, which provided City funding for the ETC and its planning process, with the goal of having the ETC prepare a proposal to be submitted to the voters, allowing the voters to decide whether to establish an authority with the power to raise public funds to plan, finance, build, acquire, complete, operate, charge for, and maintain an expanded monorail system; and

 WHEREAS, in 2002 the Washington State Legislature enacted an enabling statute, 2002 Washington Laws ch. 248 (the "Enabling Legislation"), which allows voters to create a "city transportation authority," a municipal corporation that would have the power to plan, construct, and operate a monorail transportation system, and which thus creates a mechanism for the implementation of the goals and objectives of Initiative 53; and

 WHEREAS, the ETC has developed a plan providing direction for the first stage of planning, construction, and operation of a monorail system, as envisioned by Initiatives 41 and 53; and

 WHEREAS, a new city transportation authority should use its best efforts to see that such a monorail system is integrated with other transit systems such as those operated by Sound Transit, King County, Amtrak, and other such entities; and

 WHEREAS, a new city transportation authority would be authorized, pursuant to the Enabling Legislation, to utilize funding mechanisms for such a new monorail system and to prepare, adopt, and implement a plan for building such a system, and to refine such a plan through engineering, environmental, and other necessary inquiries and studies; and

 WHEREAS, a new city transportation authority should be accountable to the people of the City of Seattle; and

 WHEREAS, this Ordinance, developed in cooperation with the ETC, is formulated to carry out the intent of Initiatives 41 and 53; and

 WHEREAS, the Enabling Legislation provides that the qualified electors of the City may decide whether to establish a city transportation authority and the mechanisms for funding it, for the purposes authorized thereunder; and

 WHEREAS, the City Council finds it in the best interests of the City and its citizens that the voters determine whether a city transportation authority should be established, a monorail system plan implemented, specific funding mechanisms established, and other steps taken pursuant to the Enabling Legislation; NOW, THEREFORE,

If an SPMA Board member ceases to be a legally registered voter of the Authority Area at any time during his or her Term, that Board member shall be deemed to be immediately removed from the SPMA Board and his or her position shall be deemed vacant and filled as provided in Subsection 4(g).

 (B) if such member is convicted of a felony or crime of moral turpitude; or

 (C) for "gross neglect of duties," as that term is defined in the Seattle Popular Monorail Authority bylaws, and pursuant to any additional procedures that the bylaws specify shall govern the SPMA Board's determination of whether such gross neglect of duties has occurred.

 No appointed SPMA Board member may vote on his or her own removal, and such automatic disqualification shall not be counted to cause the automatic reduction described in the first sentence of this Subsection 4(g). If any appointed SPMA Board position becomes vacant during the Term for such position, for whatever reason, the entity that nominated the SPMA Board member to that position shall promptly nominate a replacement member to serve the remainder of such Term. Such nominee shall be subject to appointment by the entity that appointed the SPMA Board member to that position.

 (h) Interim Board. The ETC Council, constituted as of the Voter Approval Date pursuant to Initiative 41 and Initiative 53, shall become the Seattle Popular Monorail Authority's Interim Board upon the Voter Approval Date. The Interim Board shall act in the SPMA Board's stead and have all of its powers until such time as at least seven members of the first SPMA Board have been appointed pursuant to Subsection 4(b), at which time the Interim Board shall be succeeded by the first SPMA Board and cease to exist. The Interim Board shall govern the Seattle Popular Monorail Authority no longer than 14 months. Members of the Interim Board may be removed and replaced in the manner prescribed for SPMA Board members under Subsection 4(g)(1), except that any replacement member shall be nominated by a majority of the remaining members of the Interim Board and appointed by the City Council. For each reference in this Section 4 to the Interim Board (except for references in Subsections 4(d)(3), 4(f)(2), and 4(h)), the SPMA Board shall act instead of the Interim Board if the SPMA Board has succeeded the Interim Board as described in this Subsection 4(h).

 (i) Referral of Board Selection Method to the Voters.

 (1) The SPMA Board shall develop a proposal that:

 (A) shall provide that the voters within the Authority Area would elect members to a majority of the SPMA Board positions (with the actual number of such majority selected by the SPMA Board), while the rest of the SPMA Board positions would remain as appointed positions; and

 (B) shall include other provisions as determined appropriate by the SPMA Board.

 (2) The Seattle Popular Monorail Authority shall submit such proposal to the voters at a regular or special election to be held no earlier than November 2005 and no later than November 2009. Such proposal shall become effective only if approved by a majority vote of the electors residing with the Authority Area voting in such regular or special election.

 (3) If the Seattle Popular Monorail Authority is prohibited by law from submitting the proposal described in Subsection 4(i)(1) to the voters, then the Seattle Popular Monorail Authority may by vote of the SPMA Board deliver to the City Council an ordinance that would implement such proposal, and the City Council shall, if permitted by law, use reasonable efforts to submit such proposal to the voters in lieu of the Seattle Popular Monorail Authority doing so.

 Section 5. Adoption of the Seattle Popular Monorail Plan. Pursuant to the Enabling Legislation, the Seattle Popular Monorail Authority shall adopt the Seattle Popular Monorail Plan. The Seattle Popular Monorail Authority shall plan, finance, build, acquire, complete, operate, charge for, and maintain the Public Monorail Transportation Facilities, and otherwise exercise its authority concerning the Public Monorail Transportation Function as described in Section 3(a), consistent with this Ordinance and the ETC Plan.

 Section 6. Funding for Phase I.

 (a) The Seattle Popular Monorail Authority may levy and collect a special excise tax not to exceed 1.4 percent on the value of every motor vehicle owned by a resident of the Authority Area for the privilege of using a motor vehicle. The proceeds of such special excise tax shall be applied by the Seattle Popular Monorail Authority to pay all or a portion of the cost of Phase I, including without limitation all or a portion of the cost of any debt, including but not limited to principal and interest payments and financing costs, issued to pay some or all of such Phase I costs. The balance, if any, of the cost of Phase I shall be paid out of any other legally available funds. To the extent authorized by the Enabling Legislation, the Seattle Popular Monorail Authority may issue debt to pay the cost of Phase I, including without limitation financing costs, and may pledge the revenues from the special excise tax to secure repayment of such debt, but the Seattle Popular Monorail Authority shall not, without further voter approval, issue more than $1.5 billion (in 2002 dollars) principal amount of debt to finance Phase I costs (the "Bonding Limit"). The Bonding Limit shall automatically increase from $1.5 billion (in 2002 dollars) by an annual adjustment to account for inflation (measured by reference to the Seattle Building Cost Index maintained by Engineering News Record or, in the event that such index is no longer published or otherwise available, by reference to a comparable building cost inflation index selected by the Seattle Popular Monorail Authority). The Bonding Limit shall not apply to debt incurred to finance or refinance obligations previously issued or incurred within the Bonding Limit. Furthermore, the Seattle Popular Monorail Authority shall not, without further voter approval, after 2020 use revenues from the special excise tax to pay (1) non- capitalizable costs of operating or maintaining Phase I, or (2) the portion of any debt attributable to costs of operating or maintaining Phase I.

 (b) In addition to the special excise tax described in Subsection 6(a), the Seattle Popular Monorail Authority may collect rates, charges, and tolls for services relating to, advertising in, and use of Public Monorail Transportation Facilities, establish local improvement districts, and seek and obtain funding from other government entities, and from private entities consistent with applicable federal and State law, including without limitation through obtaining grants and other funding.

 (c) The Seattle Popular Monorail Authority shall not, without future voter approval, continue to levy the special excise tax provided for in Subsection 6(a) after all debt issued to plan, finance, build, acquire, complete, operate, charge for, or maintain Phase I, or debt issued to refund such debt, has been repaid or its payment irrevocably provided for. Further, the Seattle Popular Monorail Authority shall not accumulate a surplus from the proceeds of the special excise tax beyond Phase I expenses, except as determined by the SPMA Board to be required for prudent management of the Seattle Public Monorail Authority, including without limitation funding debt service reserves, complying with debt covenants, and providing for reasonable construction and operational contingencies.

 (d) If the SPMA Board determines to proceed with any proposed additional phases beyond Phase I, then proposals for raising the funds to pay for them shall be submitted to the Authority Area's voters.

 Section 7. Repeal of Initiatives.

 (a) To avoid confusion and allow for the efficient and effective operation of the Seattle Popular Monorail Authority, and make achievement of the objectives of Initiative 41 and Initiative 53 more likely, if the voters approve the proposition submitted to them pursuant to this Ordinance, Initiative 41 and Initiative 53 will be repealed as of the Voter Approval Date.

 (b) Effective upon the Voter Approval Date, and contingent upon the ETC governing body having adopted a resolution formally waiving the ETC's right to a hearing pursuant to SMC 3.110.460, this Ordinance shall constitute the adoption by the City Council of a resolution pursuant to SMC 3.110.460 and SMC 3.110.490(1):

 (1) terminating and dissolving the ETC;

 (2) providing that the ETC's obligations and liabilities shall be satisfied from the ETC's assets and properties;

 (3) providing that, when the ETC has no further unsatisfied obligations or liabilities, the ETC's rights, assets, and property shall pass to and be distributed as provided by any applicable agreements with donors or other parties at the time of acquisition of the property regarding its disposition; and

 (4) authorizing the Mayor to contract with the ETC for the disposition of all ETC rights, assets, and property remaining after the disposition described in the foregoing portions of this Subsection 7(b), and designating the Seattle Popular Monorail Authority as the recipient thereof pursuant to SMC 3.110.490(1), on such terms as will best effectuate the purposes of this Ordinance.

 The SPMA Board may assist the ETC in winding up and completing the ETC's dissolution.

 Section 8. Dissolution of the Seattle Popular Monorail Authority .

 (a) The Seattle Popular Monorail Authority may be dissolved by a vote of the people residing within the Authority Area, for the reasons stated in, and pursuant to, the Enabling Legislation.

 (b) Upon any determination that the Seattle Popular Monorail Authority shall be dissolved (however brought about), the Seattle Popular Monorail Authority shall promptly wind up. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the Seattle Popular Monorail Authority has debt outstanding and if permitted by applicable law (excluding this or any other City Ordinance), the Seattle Popular Monorail Authority may covenant with holders of debt that it shall not be dissolved and shall continue to exist solely for the purpose of continuing to levy and collect any taxes or assessments levied by it and pledged to the repayment of outstanding Seattle Popular Monorail Authority debt, and to take such other actions as necessary to allow it to repay any remaining Seattle Popular Monorail Authority debt, and when no Seattle Popular Monorail Authority debt remains unpaid (or when provision has been made for payment of all outstanding Seattle Popular Monorail Authority debt, in accordance with the terms of the debt and in such a manner that any bondholders' liens on any Seattle Popular Monorail Authority tax revenues have been discharged, by deposit into an escrow of sufficient funds or other assets for such purpose), the Seattle Popular Monorail Authority shall cease to exist, and this Ordinance shall no longer provide for a city transportation authority. Provided, however, that nothing in this Subsection 8(b) is intended or shall be construed to modify or limit Subsection 3(b).

 Section 9. Election - Ballot Title. The City calls for a special election at which to submit the proposition below to the voters, and requests that the Director of Records and Elections of King County, Washington, as ex officio Supervisor of Elections, find the existence of an emergency pursuant to RCW Chapter 29.13 and call and conduct a special election in the City in conjunction with the state general election to be held on November 5, 2002, for the purpose of submitting to the qualified electors of the City the proposition set forth in this Ordinance.
