 WHEREAS, on March 19, 2002, the Seattle City Council Transportation Committee recommended approval of the street vacation petition, subject to conditions; and

 WHEREAS, on March 25, 2002, the Seattle City Council granted approval of the street vacation petition, subject to conditions; and

 WHEREAS, The City requested SHA's execution of a Property Use and Development Agreement to ensure compliance with any conditions of street vacation approval that will not be fully satisfied prior to passage of the ordinance vacating the above-referenced streets and alleys; and

 WHEREAS, SHA executed and recorded, at King County Recording No. 20030708002895, a Property Use and Development Agreement prior to obtaining the City's approval of it; and

 WHEREAS, because the City will not approve or accept the recorded Property Use and Development Agreement, it must be replaced with a document containing language acceptable to the City:

 NOW, THEREFORE, SHA hereby covenants, bargains and agrees on behalf of itself, its successors and assigns, that if the ordinance vacating the above-referenced streets and alleys is passed by the Seattle City Council and approved by the Mayor, SHA shall operate and maintain the Rainier Vista Redevelopment in accordance with this Replacement Property Use and Development Agreement:

 Section 1. Addressed below are those conditions of the street vacation approval that require on-going effort during the construction and operation of the Rainier Vista Redevelopment, and could not, therefore, be met prior to passage of the ordinance vacating the above-referenced streets and alleys.

 A. Substantial Conformance: The Rainier Vista Redevelopment shall be substantially in conformance with the project presented to the City Council Transportation committee in February and March of 2002, as the same may be amended.

 B. Memorandum of Agreement: The Rainier Vista Redevelopment shall be in conformity with the terms and conditions outlined in the Memorandum of Agreement (MOA) authorized by Ordinance 120562.

 C. Street Improvements: All street improvements in the Rainier Vista Redevelopment shall be designed to City standards and be reviewed and approved by Seattle Department of Transportation ("SDOT"). SHA shall insure that the Redevelopment contains at a minimum the street improvements identified in the March 2002 conditions of street vacation approval adopted by the Seattle City Council in C.F. 304248.

 D. Utilities: SHA shall resolve all utility issues to the full satisfaction of impacted utilities which shall include Seattle City Light; Qwest Communications; Puget Sound Energy; Comcast; and Seattle Public Utilities. SHA shall insure that there will be no disruption in utility service to adjacent private property owners. SHA shall provide adjacent property owners who will be impacted by utility work with a schedule, notice prior to the commencement of work, and an emergency contact number. SHA shall restore to existing conditions any private property altered by utility work.

 E. Quarterly Reports: SHA shall provide SDOT with Quarterly Reports providing an update on the development activity and schedule of the Rainier Vista Redevelopment. The requirement to provide these quarterly reports shall end when the Rainier Vista Redevelopment is complete.

 F. Tree Preservation: SHA shall follow the tree preservation plan from the Master Use Permit submittal as revised and presented to the Transportation Committee on March 19, 2002 and the Settlement Agreement arising out of the lawsuit filed in the United States District Court for the Western District of Washington, Harris, et. Al v. HUD, et. al, No. CV02-1481 C. SHA shall continue to work to preserve as many trees on site as practicable without substantially altering the development pattern or master planning design recommended by the joint committee of the Seattle Design Commission and the Neighborhood Design Board. SHA's final plan for street tree removal and replacement and the landscaping plan shall require the review and approval of the Landscape Architect Office in Seattle Transportation.

 Section 2. The legal description of the property upon which the Rainier Vista Redevelopment is located (the "Property") is included in Exhibit 1 hereto, which is incorporated herein by this reference. An executed copy of this Replacement Property Use and Development Agreement shall be recorded in the records of King County and the covenants hereof shall be deemed to attach to and run with the Property. This Replacement Property Use and Development Agreement replaces and supersedes the Property Use and Development Agreement recorded under King County recording No. 20030708002895, which document shall be deemed null and void.

 Section 3. This Replacement Property Use and Development Agreement may be amended or modified by mutual agreement between the City and SHA, according to the following procedure. Minor changes to this Agreement may be approved by SDOT, if the proposed change is consistent with the purpose and intent of the conditions. Any major changes to this Agreement, as determined by SDOT, shall require approval by the City Council of the City by resolution or ordinance. SDOT shall provide SHA with notice and the opportunity to comment on whether a change is considered minor or major, prior to SDOT making that determination. Nothing in this Replacement Property Use and Development Agreement shall be construed as a surrender of the City's governmental powers.

 Section 4. SHA hereby agrees to indemnify, defend, and hold the City harmless from any and all claims, demands, suits, actions, damages, recoveries, judgments, costs, or expenses (including, without limitation, reasonable attorneys' fees) paid by the City and arising or growing out of or in connection with or resulting from, either directly or indirectly, the vacation of the above-named streets. The City shall give SHA prompt notice of any claims of which it is aware. SHA shall promptly assume responsibility for the claim or undertake the defense of any litigation on behalf of the City. The City shall cooperate fully with SHA in the defense of any claim. The City shall not settle any claim without the prior written consent of SHA, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld.

 Section 5. This Replacement Property Use and Development Agreement is made for the benefit of the City and the public. The City may institute and prosecute any proceeding law or in equity to enforce this Replacement Property Use and Development Agreement.

 Section 6. It is further expressly agreed that in the event any covenant or condition or restriction in this instrument or any portion thereof is invalid or void, such invalidity or voidness shall in no way affect any other covenant, condition or restriction.
