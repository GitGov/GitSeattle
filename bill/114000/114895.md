 ORDINANCE _________________

 AN ORDINANCE relating to the Department of Parks and Recreation; setting forth the terms of property transfers at the Aki Kurose (Sharples) Middle School/Brighton Playfield site and the Denny Middle School/Southwest Community Center site; authorizing the Superintendent to execute on behalf of the City a deed to the Seattle School District #1 for the Brighton parcel, to accept on behalf of the City a deed, easement and leases from the School District for the Southwest Community Center, and to accomplish Lot Boundary Adjustments in connection therewith; and superseding the requirements of Ordinance 118477 for the purpose of transfer of the Brighton parcel.

 WHEREAS, the 1999 Community Center and Seattle Center Levy and the 2000 Neighborhood Parks, Green Spaces, Trails and Zoo Levy authorized the funding of the expansion of the Southwest Community Center facility; and

 WHEREAS, such expansion requires the acquisition of property from the Seattle School District No.1 ("School District") located adjacent the Southwest Community Center at 2801 S.W. Thistle Street; and

 WHEREAS, a portion of the Aki Kurose school building at 39th S. and S. Graham is located upon property owned by the Department of Parks and Recreation (Parks) and the School District has expressed an interest in owning rather than leasing such property; and

 WHEREAS, the School District has offered to exchange the property needed by the City for the Southwest Community Center for the property owned by Parks and located under a portion of the Aki Kurose school building, all in lieu of cash payment; and

 WHEREAS, because the proposed transaction does not meet the literal requirements of Ordinance 118477; and

 WHEREAS, because the transaction provides that benefit to the Southwest Community Center without any detriment to park interests at Aki Kurose School, since a school is already located upon Parks-owned property, this ordinance supersedes the requirements of Ordinance 118477; and

 WHEREAS, the exchange serves the public interest by fulfilling the expansion of the Southwest Community Center, a purpose of the 1999 Community Center and Seattle Center Levy, and the 2000 Neighborhood Parks, Green Spaces, Trails and Zoo Levy; NOW, THEREFORE,

 BE IT ORDAINED BY THE CITY OF SEATTLE AS FOLLOWS:

The Superintendent of Parks and Recreation or his designee is authorized to join with the Seattle School District No. 1 (School District) in obtaining Lot Boundary Adjustments from the Department of Planning and Development in order to accomplish the transfer of property from the City to the District for Aki Kurose (Sharples) School and from the School District to the City for the Southwest Community Center.

 Section 2. The Superintendent of Parks and Recreation or his designee is authorized to execute a Quit Claim Deed to the District substantially in the form of Attachment 1 to this ordinance, transferring property adjacent to the Brighton Playfield and beneath the Aki Kurose School to the ownership of the School District.

 Section 3. The Superintendent of Parks and Recreation or his designee is authorized to accept a Quit Claim Deed, leasehold interests, and an easement from the School District for the real property interests described in Attachment 2 to this ordinance which shall be transferred and accepted for Parks and Recreation purposes.

 Section 4. The requirements of Ordinance 118477 adopting Initiative 42, regarding exchanges of land held for park and recreation purposes, are hereby superseded for the purposes of this ordinance.

 Section 5. Any act consistent with the authority and prior to the effective date of this ordinance is hereby ratified and confirmed.

 Section 6. This ordinance shall take effect and be in force thirty (30) days from and after its approval by the Mayor, but if not approved and returned by the Mayor within ten (10) days after presentation, it shall take effect as provided by Municipal Code Section 1.04.020.

City further agrees to indemnify, defend, and hold District and the Premises free and harmless from, and against, any and all damages, injuries, losses, liens, costs or expenses (including attorneys' fees) incurred, claimed or arising out of said work. District reserves the right to review and approve City's plans, specifications and contractor and, further, District reserves the right to impose such restrictions or conditions upon its consent to the above work, including the requirement that City appropriately bond the same, as District may deem reasonably appropriate.

 City acknowledges and agrees that District shall have no obligation whatsoever to make any alterations, additions, renovations or improvements to the Premises or to determine if any alterations are necessary in order for City to conduct its business. In the event that any federal, state, or city department or agency determines that certain alterations, additions, renovations or improvements are required to permit City to use the Premises for its business purpose(s), District shall have no obligation to make such changes. If City is unable, in its sole judgment, to make such changes, then this Agreement shall be terminated. In such case, the District may, at its option, decide to require City to leave in place any alterations, additions, renovations or improvements or remove any portion or all, at the City's cost.

ACCESS TO PREMISES For the term of this Lease, District assures Parks of both vehicular and pedestrian access to the Premises which will be equal to that existing at the time of the execution of this agreement.

District reserves the right to review and approve City's plans, specifications and contractor and, further, District reserves the right to impose such restrictions or conditions upon its consent to the above work, including the requirement that City appropriately bond the same, as District may deem reasonably appropriate.

 City acknowledges and agrees that District shall have no obligation whatsoever to make any alterations, additions, renovations or improvements to the Premises or to determine if any alterations are necessary in order for City to conduct its business.

If City is unable, in its sole judgment, to make such changes, then this Agreement shall be terminated. In such case, the District may, at its option, decide to require City to leave in place any alterations, additions, renovations or improvements or remove any portion or all, at the City's cost.
