 ORDINANCE __________________

 AN ORDINANCE relating to absences of City officers and employees from the usual worksite for purposes of voluntary participation as donors in certain medical procedures.

 WHEREAS, City employees who voluntarily participate as non-compensated donors in life-saving medical procedures provide a service that is in the public interest and furthers the public health mission of the City of Seattle; and

 WHEREAS, the City of Seattle recognizes the value of this service and the sacrifices made by City employees who participate;

 NOW THEREFORE,

 BE IT ORDAINED BY THE CITY OF SEATTLE AS FOLLOWS:

 Section 1. Seattle Municipal Code Section 4.24.035, Ordinance 112088 as last amended by Ordinance 117958, is hereby further amended as follows:

 4.24.035 - Paid sick leave-Use

 A. An officer's or employee's request for paid sick leave may be granted when the officer or employee is required to be absent from work because of:

 1. A personal illness, injury or medical disability incapacitating the officer or employee for the performance of duty, or personal medical or dental appointments; or

 2. An illness, injury, or medical or dental appointment of an officer's or employee's spouse, domestic partner, or the parent or dependent child of such officer or employee or his or her spouse or domestic partner when the officer or employee has established his or her eligibility for a non-personal sick leave use as contemplated by SMC Chapter 4.30 and the absence of the officer or employee from work is required, or when such absence is recommended by a health care professional;

 B. An officer or employee may participate in City-sponsored blood drives as a non-compensated donor without deduction of pay or paid leave balances. Such participation will include the time required to travel from the work site to the blood drive location and return to the work site, and a reasonable recuperation period, but may not exceed three (3) hours per occurrence.

C. 1. Officers and regularly appointed employees shall be eligible for up to five (5) workdays or forty (40) hours, whichever is less, of absence from their usual worksite without reduction in pay or use of paid leave to the extent their absence is medically necessary for the purpose of being a Transplant Donor, as that term is defined in this subsection. "Transplant Donor" means a regularly appointed employee or officer who:  a. voluntarily donates his or her bone marrow, other tissue, or organ to a human recipient for whom that particular donation has been medically matched and determined to be uniquely suited or critical to a successful outcome in a medical procedure intended to save the recipient's life;

 b. receives no compensation and has no ability to direct any compensation to any other person or entity for the officer or employee's donation or participation as a donor;

 c. provides to his or her appointing authority reasonable advance written notice of his or her need to be absent from the usual worksite as well as the reason for and expected duration of the absence;

 d. provides written documentation satisfactory to his or her appointing authority from an accredited medical institution, organization or individual of the need for the officer or employee to participate as a donor; and

 e. has not been a Transplant Donor under this subsection C for a different medical procedure within the twelve (12) months immediately preceding the date when the absence under this subsection would commence.

 2. A Transplant Donor for whom an absence in excess of the time allowed in subsection C1 is documented as being medically necessary shall be eligible to use any appropriate available leave balance or take unpaid leave in accordance with existing City ordinances and rules.

 3. No absence is authorized under this subsection C for tests or for other pre-donation appointments.

 Section 2. Any compensated or uncompensated absence from the usual worksite on or after March 1, 2002, pursuant to the authority but prior to the effective date of this ordinance is ratified and confirmed.

 Section 3. This ordinance shall take effect and be in force thirty (30) days from and after its approval by the Mayor, but if not approved and returned by the Mayor within ten (10) days after presentation, it shall take effect as provided by Municipal Code Section 1.04.020.
