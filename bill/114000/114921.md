 Public Bid

 Procedure for Disposing

 of Surplus Real Property

 * The basis for disposing of property shall be by competitive bid. Each property is to be conveyed AS-IS, WHERE-IS, WITH-ALL-FAULTS, AND WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY WHATSOEVER, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED AS TO ITS CONDITION, ENVIRONMENTAL OR OTHERWISE, OR ITS SUITABILITY OR SUFFICIENCY FOR THE PURCHASER'S INTENDED USES AND PURPOSES. The City makes no representation or warranty whatsoever as to the condition of the property to be conveyed to the purchaser. Prospective bidders will be given the opportunity to inspect the property prior to bidding, and to have any professional tests or inspections conducted at the bidders' sole expense and risk, subject to such conditions as the Director shall deem appropriate.

 * Conveyance shall be by Quit Claim Deed

 * Bid packets shall include a brief description of each property offered, a neighborhood map, an Offer Sheet and a sample Quit Claim Deed. Copies of the bid packet and other related documents shall be available to prospective bidders on request.

 * Notice of the sale shall be given in the Seattle Daily Journal of Commerce and other appropriate print media, through direct mail to interested parties, and by such other means as the Housing Director shall determine to be reasonable, fair, and effective for the marketing of the property, including a posted "For Sale" sign on the site.

 * The successful bidder shall be the responsive bidder offering the highest acceptable price and agreeing to the terms of the Quit Claim Deed.

 * An acceptable price shall be a price above a threshold set by OH below which it may reject any and all bids. The threshold will be based on an opinion of value, and will be made public prior to the bid opening.

 * If the OH Director determines that a competitive environment did not exist, the bid or bids may be rejected. OH will evaluate whether to re-advertise or to consider other alternatives for the property.

 * Sales will be completed within thirty (30) days after acceptance of the bid.

 * The Director may reserve the right to waive irregularities, to allow corrections, and to extend the period in which bids may be submitted.

 * A bid deposit will be required, and in the event that the winning bidder is unable to close on the transaction in the time allotted, their bid deposit will be retained as liquidated damages.
