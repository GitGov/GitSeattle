 1.1 Unocal is the former owner of that certain real property described in Exhibit A attached hereto and incorporated herein ("Property").

 1.2 Unocal sold the Property to the Union Group, but agreed under paragraphs 5.3 through 5.5 of the "Agreement for Sale of Real Property and Escrow Instructions" dated September 14, 1999, as amended by the "Addendum to Agreement for Sale of Real Property and Escrow Instructions" dated on or about December 28, 1999 (collectively referred to as the "Unocal Agreement"), to indemnify the Union Group and its successors from and against certain remedial action costs and certain claims of the owners and operators of the Marqueen Hotel property and the City of Seattle with respect to its rights of way adjacent to the Property. A true and correct copy of the Unocal Agreement is attached hereto as Exhibit B.

 1.3 The City has entered into a real estate purchase and sale agreement with the Union Group for acquisition of the Property subject to certain terms and conditions. A condition precedent to the City's obligation to purchase is the Union Group's assignment to the City of all of its rights to indemnification and remediation as set forth in the Unocal Agreement, Unocal's consent to such assignment, and Unocal's affirmative acknowledgment of continued responsibility for certain environmental matters, including migration of contaminants from the Property to the City's adjacent right of way.

 2. Assignment. Union Group hereby assigns, conveys, transfers and sets over to the City all if its rights and interests in and under paragraphs 5.3 through 5.5 of the Unocal Agreement.

 3. Warranty. Union Group and Unocal represent and warrant to the City that paragraphs 5.3 through 5.5 of the Unocal Agreement are in full force and effect, and that neither the Union Group nor Unocal is in default in the performance of any of their respective obligations thereunder.

Unocal agrees that the City may submit all claims directly to Unocal, and that the City need not bring a claim against itself, when the City's costs, claims, losses or expenses concern alleged migration of contamination from the Property to the City's right-of-way adjacent to the Property. The fact that the City is the owner of the Property and holder of an easement in the rights of way adjacent to the Property shall in no way affect Unocal's obligation to indemnify, defend, and hold the City harmless with respect to contamination in the rights of way. No covenants, conditions, restrictions, waivers or releases contained in the Unocal Agreement or in any other agreement or document executed by Unocal and the Union Group shall affect in any way Unocal's acknowledgement of Unocal's obligations or Unocal's affirmative undertaking to indemnify, defend, and hold the City harmless. In addition, nothing in these documents shall affect in any way the City's rights or claims against Unocal or others, under any environmental laws, with respect to the City's right-of-way or any contamination within the City's right-of-way, including alleged migration of contaminants from the Property to the right-of-way. Unocal acknowledges that the City does not release or indemnify Unocal for any claims, including claims relating to contamination under any environmental laws, within the right-of-way. In consideration for Unocal's affirmative undertaking, the City hereby agrees to undertake the obligations in and under paragraphs 5.4 and 5.5 of the Unocal Agreement. The City further acknowledges the disclosures set forth in and under paragraph 5.1 of the Unocal Agreement, and agrees to the releases and indemnification provisions set forth in paragraphs 5.2 and 6 of the Unocal Agreement except to the extent they conflict with Unocal's affirmative undertaking to the City set forth above.

 6. Severability. If any portion of this Assignment shall be held to be invalid, the same shall not affect in any respect whatsoever the validity of the remainder of this Assignment, which shall be enforced in accordance with its terms.
