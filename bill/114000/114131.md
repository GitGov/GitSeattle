 Seattle Police Department

 Emergency Preparedness Bureau

 Concept Paper

 Background

 The world has changed dramatically in many respects since September 11. This is especially true in the field of emergency management. Prior to September 11, law enforcement was a part-time player in emergency management; fire and emergency medical services exercised lead roles. While these latter services are still very important, the role of police has been elevated radically. As observed by Attorney General Ashcroft at a recent meeting of Major City Chiefs, the ever- present possibility of terrorist strikes in our cities means that police must regard emergency management as a critical full-time function, just like the patrol and investigative functions.

 The three key counter-terrorism roles that can only be filled by police agencies are preventive (intelligence gathering, analysis, and forecasting), operational (planning and executing effective deterrent strategies and tactics), and investigative (incident/crime scene follow up). The intelligence gathering role, conducted in concert with the FBI and other national agencies, requires security clearance. This fact suggests that police are the local agency best suited to perform a fourth critical counter-terrorism role: linkage with federal agencies.

 There is an emerging trend among major city police agencies to consolidate in one bureau or division, under a full-time senior commander, the numerous security disciplines required for analyzing, planning, and responding to terrorist threats.

 The foregoing points have led us to the conclusion that police have a new, critical role to play in emergency management post-September 11. Equally significant, the Police Department person on point for emergency management must be at the highest level of authority, experience, and credibility. Only the Chief or a Deputy/Assistant Chief can assume command of the Police Department and temporarily reorganize its resources to respond effectively to a large-scale disaster.

 Proposal

 SPD proposes the creation of a new Emergency Preparedness Bureau, headed by an Assistant Chief, with a direct report to the Chief of Police through the Deputy Chief of Operations (see chart attached). This action clearly meets the Mayor's goal of enhancing public safety and making Seattle the best prepared City in the nation.

 This Assistant Chief will be charged with ensuring City preparedness for disasters or emergencies, be they natural or manmade, including terrorist threats. The Assistant Chief will be responsible for:

 1. Directing emergency operations when the City's Emergency Operations Center (EOC) is activated;

 2. Reducing vulnerability to known threats and hazards, including protection of the City's power grid and water supply;

 3. Providing oversight of police training to deal with unusual occurrences and of readiness exercises conducted jointly with other Departments and outside agencies (e.g., the $4.7 million TOPOFF '03 exercise);

 4. Coordinating with other emergency management and law enforcement agencies at the local, state, and federal levels to ensure availability of outside assistance and information, when resource needs exceed local capabilities;

 5. Preparing appropriate plans and infrastructure surveys to ensure Citywide preparedness;

 6. Coordinating with other City Departments (e.g., Fire, Seattle Public Utilities, Public Health) through the City's Disaster Management Committee to ensure effective cooperation; and

 7. Directing City recovery efforts in the aftermath of disaster.

 The Emergency Preparedness Bureau will consolidate resources from three existing SPD units - Emergency Management (operations and planning), Criminal Intelligence (threat assessment), and Field Support (event staffing and mobilization). Together, the staff of these units represents more than 50 years of experience in the field of emergency management and special events planning.( In addition, when needed to meet priority planning and training requirements, the Assistant Chief of Emergency Preparedness will be able to enlist personnel Department-wide for temporary assignments with the Bureau. These "matrix resources" may include specialists from SWAT, Bomb Squad, Information Technology, Training, and Patrol Deployment.

 Next Steps

 With the approval of the Mayor and City Council, this Bureau can begin operations in April 2002. Within two weeks of authorization, the Bureau will be staffed and operations will begin. Within a month of beginning, the Bureau will have established a Work Program, with priorities.

 Three major areas of activity are envisioned for the first 18 months of operation: 1) intelligence gathering and vulnerability analysis, 2) plan development, and 3) training and exercise development (i.e., TOPOFF '03).

 ( The new Bureau will have a staff of 35, including 23 sworn and 12 civilian positions, as follows: 1 Assistant Chief, 1 Police Captain, 2 Police Lieutenants, 3 Police Sergeants-Detective, 11 Police Officers- Detective, 5 Police Officers, 1 Manager 3, 3 Strategic Advisors II, 4 Administrative Specialists II, 1 Emergency Preparedness Officer, 1 Planning & Development Specialist II, 1 Information Technology Professional B, and 1 half-time Systems Analyst.

 The Honorable Peter Steinbrueck

 President, Seattle City Council

 Dear President Steinbrueck,

 I fully endorse and have been involved in a collaborative process with the Chief of Police to support this proposal.

 Establishment of this senior position in the Police Department that consolidates policy, training, command and control, intelligence gathering, analysis and operational planning functions, in response to terrorism and weapons of mass destruction, strengthens the relationship and coordination between the City's two primary public safety departments.

 The Fire Department has traditionally provided leadership with our special operations and emergency medical services. This proposed position offers full time partnership with the Police as we work together to strengthen our emergency planning and complementary operational capabilities.

 Very truly yours,

 Gary P. Morris, Fire Chief

 Seattle Fire Department
