 ORDINANCE __________

 AN ORDINANCE relating to surveillance cameras in police squad cars; directing the Seattle Police Department to purchase thirty (30) video surveillance cameras, install them in thirty (30) squad cars, and operate the video cameras for the purpose of monitoring activities within the view of those cameras; reducing an appropriation in the 2002 budget of the Office of Policy and Management and reappropriating that money to the Seattle Police Department to purchase the aforementioned video surveillance cameras.

 WHEREAS the City is committed to policing procedures that are fair, equitable and constitutional; and

 WHEREAS the City condemned in Resolution 30223 racial profiling in policing procedures which is defined in the Resolution as the use of race or ethnicity as a factor in deciding to stop and question, arrest or search a persons without a legal basis under the United States and Washington State Constitutions; and

 WHEREAS the City authorized in Resolution 30223 the creation of the Citizen Task Force on Racial Profiling to work with City agencies and academics to propose a design for a racial profiling data collection process to the City Council; and

 WHEREAS the Citizen Task Force members performed a great service to the citizens of Seattle by devoting their time, energies and intellect to studying data collection programs designed to examine racial based profiling; and

 WHEREAS the report to the City Council issued by the Citizen Task Force recommended a proposed data collection system, as requested by the City Council, but contained discussions about the use of data collection systems for racial profiling in other jurisdictions that suggested that the data collected does not prove or disprove whether law enforcement engages in racial profiling; and

 WHEREAS the installation of video surveillance cameras and audio surveillance devices in police vehicles, if used during all stops of vehicles or pedestrians for whatever purpose, would advance the City's commitment to fair, equitable and constitutional policing procedures by identifying the individuals involved in the stop and providing a record of what transpired during the stop; and

 WHEREAS the installation of video surveillance cameras and audio surveillance devices in police vehicles, if used during stops, further the City's commitment to policing procedures that are fair, equitable and constitutional; and
