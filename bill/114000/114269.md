 AN ORDINANCE relating to land use and zoning, amending Section 23.54.015 of the Seattle Municipal Code, modifying minimum parking requirements for multifamily uses that provide housing to low-income households, clarifying regulations, and correcting minor errors.

 WHEREAS, Land Use Policy 138 in the Seattle Comprehensive Plan provides direction to balance the need to meet the approximate parking demand generated by new development so as to avoid adding to congestion of parked cars on surrounding streets, with the countervailing need to limit the effects structured parking can have on housing costs, and to recognize the Seattle Comprehensive Plan's policies encouraging the use of public transit and discouraging the use of automobiles; and

 WHEREAS, Land Use Policy 139 in the Seattle Comprehensive Plan recommends allowing exceptions to parking requirements for projects in which the parking demand of the occupants may be significantly different from those of the general population; and

 WHEREAS, Housing Policy 5 in the Seattle Comprehensive Plan recommends allowing lower off-street parking requirements where lower car ownership and parking utilization can be demonstrated; and

 WHEREAS, Housing Policy 7 in the Seattle Comprehensive Plan recommends conducting periodic assessment of the effects of City policies and regulations on housing development costs and overall housing affordability, considering the balance between housing affordability and the other objectives such as environmental quality, urban design quality, maintenance of neighborhood character, and protection of public health, safety and welfare; and

 WHEREAS, the Office of Housing conducted a survey of parking utilization in low- income housing projects in March 2001 to evaluate the impacts of the City's parking policies and regulations on development costs for low-income housing projects and to identify opportunities to lower off-street parking requirements based on survey findings; and

 WHEREAS, Council adopted Ordinance 120004 on June 26, 2000, implementing key recommendations in the Pike/Pine Urban Center Village Plan, including lower off- street parking requirements within the Pike/Pine Overlay District, recognizing that car ownership and parking utilization rates in this area are lower compared to those for the city as a whole, as demonstrated through a neighborhood parking study; and

 WHEREAS, Council adopted Resolution 30196 establishing the City's Neighborhood Planning Policy Docket 17, On and Off-street Parking Management Strategies, providing direction to the Strategic Planning Office, the Department of Design, Construction and Land Use, Seattle Transportation, City Budget Office, Executive Services Department, and other City departments to work with communities to develop and implement parking management strategies; and

 WHEREAS, Council adopted Ordinance 120541 on October 1, 2001 relating to land use and zoning, modifying minimum parking requirements for multifamily uses that provide housing for low-income households; and

 WHEREAS, in discussing Ordinance 120541, Councilmembers requested the Executive to study whether transitional housing or very low-income populations had car ownership patterns that justified further modifications in minimum parking requirements for multifamily uses serving such populations; and

 WHEREAS, the Executive found car ownership patterns to be significantly different in certain neighborhoods for households with incomes at or below thirty (30) percent of the median family income, adjusted for household size, for the Seattle-Bellevue-Everett Primary Metropolitan Statistical Area, as defined by the United States Department of Housing and Urban Development; NOW THEREFORE,

If the gymnasium contains bleachers, the parking requirement for the entire gymnasium shall be one (1) parking space for every eight (8) fixed seats. Each twenty (20) inches of width of bleachers shall be counted as one (1) fixed seat for the purposes of determining parking requirements. If the gymnasium does not contain bleachers and is in a school, there is no parking requirement for the gymnasium. If the gymnasium does not contain bleachers and is in a community center, the parking requirement shall be one (1) space for each three hundred fifty (350) square feet. If the gymnasium does not contain bleachers and is in a community center owned and operated by the Department of Parks and Recreation (DOPAR), the parking requirement shall be one (1) space for each five hundred fifty-five (555) square feet.

 7For public schools, when an auditorium or other place of assembly is demolished and a new one built in its place, parking requirements shall be determined based on the new construction. When an existing public school on an existing public school site is remodeled, additional parking is required if any auditorium or other place of assembly is expanded or additional fixed seats are added. Additional parking is required as shown on Chart A for the increase in floor area or increase in number of seats only. If the parking requirement for the increased area or seating is ten (10) percent or less than that for the existing auditorium or other place of assembly, then no additional parking shall be required.

 11 Required parking for spectator sports facilities or exhibition halls must be available when the facility or exhibition hall is in use. A facility shall be considered to be "in use" during the period beginning three (3) hours before an event is scheduled to begin and ending one (1) hour after a scheduled event is expected to end. For sports events of variable or uncertain duration, the expected event length shall be the average length of the events of the same type for which the most recent data are available, provided it is within the past five (5) years. During an inaugural season, or for nonrecurring events, the ~~bast~~best available good faith estimate of event duration will be used. A facility will not be deemed to be "in use" by virtue of the fact that administrative or maintenance personnel are present. The Director may reduce the required parking for any event when projected attendance for a spectator sports facility is certified to be fifty (50) percent or less of the facility's seating capacity, to an amount not less than that required for the certified projected attendance, at the rate of one (1) space for each ten (10) fixed seats of certified projected attendance. An application for reduction and the certification shall be submitted to the Director at least fifteen (15) days prior to the event. When the event is one of a series of similar events, such certification may be submitted for the entire series fifteen (15) days prior to the first event in the series. If the Director finds that a certification of projected attendance of fifty (50) percent or less of the seating capacity is  based on satisfactory evidence such as past attendance at similar events or advance ticket sales, the Director shall, within fifteen (15) days of such submittal, notify the facility operator that a reduced parking requirement has been approved, with any conditions deemed appropriate by the Director to ensure adequacy of parking if expected attendance should change. The parking requirement reduction may be applied for only if the goals of the facility's Transportation Management Plan are otherwise being met. The Director may revoke or modify a parking requirement reduction approval during a series, if projected attendance is exceeded.

 12 For purposes of this section, Center City neighborhoods are the following urban villages: Uptown Queen Anne, South Lake Union, Capitol Hill, Pike/Pine, First Hill, and 12th Avenue, as shown in the City of Seattle Comprehensive Plan.

 13 These general requirements for multifamily uses are superseded to the extent that a use, structure or development qualifies for either a greater or a lesser parking requirement under any provision below. To the extent that more than one of the provisions below applies to a multifamily use, the least of the applicable parking requirements applies. The different parking requirements for certain multifamily uses listed below shall not be construed to create separate uses for purposes of any requirements related to establishing or changing a use under this title.

 14 Notice of Income Restrictions. Prior to issuance of any permit to establish, construct or modify any use or structure, or to reduce any parking accessory to a multifamily use or structure, if the applicant relies upon these reduced parking requirements, the applicant shall record in the King County Office of Records and Elections a declaration signed and acknowledged by the owner(s), in a form prescribed by the Director, which shall identify the subject property by legal description, and shall acknowledge and provide notice to any prospective purchasers that specific income limits are a condition for maintaining the reduced parking requirement.
