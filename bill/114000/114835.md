 AN ORDINANCE relating to opinion-gathering activities undertaken by certain departments and offices in the City of Seattle; authorizing the use of funds appropriated for 2004 for certain kinds of opinion- gathering activities; establishing a process for City Council approval of opinion-gathering activities and related expenditures; and adding a new chapter to Title 5 of the Seattle Municipal Code.

 WHEREAS, in 2002 and 2003, certain City departments and offices spent at least $508,097 from various funding sources on polls, surveys, focus groups and other forms of opinion gathering; and

 WHEREAS, the budgets for those City departments and offices do not have line items of business for opinion-gathering activities, increasing the likelihood of misuse of appropriated funds and making it impossible for the Council to determine whether funds are being spent as Council intends; and

 WHEREAS, in approving the 2004 City Budget, the City Council included a proviso (Tab 011, Action ID 1, Option B, Version 3) limiting the use of funds appropriated for 2004 on opinion-gathering activities by requiring certain departments and offices to submit questions and supporting materials to the relevant City Council Committee Chairperson before spending any funds on opinion-gathering activity, and requiring an ordinance authorizing the expenditure of appropriated funds in excess of $2,500 on opinion-gathering activities; and

 WHEREAS, the proviso has been a source of confusion for, and has been interpreted differently by, various departments and offices; and

 WHEREAS, the City Council wishes to eliminate that confusion by establishing a process for approval of expenditures related to opinion-gathering activities going forward beyond the 2004 budget year, and to authorize the expenditure of funds appropriated for 2004 on certain kinds of such activities; and

 WHEREAS, as an interim measure, the President of the City Council has provided the Director of the Department of Finance with a letter clarifying the process for complying with the proviso, until such time as the City Council adopts an ordinance setting forth a permanent process;

 NOW, THEREFORE,

 BE IT ORDAINED BY THE CITY OF SEATTLE AS FOLLOWS:

 Section 1.

 A. Expenditures of 2004 appropriated funds on opinion-gathering activities, as defined in the 2004 budget proviso on polls and surveys (Tab 011, Action ID 1, Option B, Version 3), and on consultant contracts related thereto, that a department or office identified in writing to the Chairperson of the relevant standing committee of the City Council prior to the effective date of this ordinance, are hereby authorized, ratified and confirmed, so long as the department or office (1) presents the questions and supporting materials to the Chairperson of the relevant standing committee of the City Council before undertaking such activity and (2) commits to present the results as described in the 2004 budget proviso at the conclusion of such activity.

 B. In addition, funds appropriated for 2004 to each of the City departments and offices listed in the 2004 budget proviso on polls and surveys, if not already authorized for expenditure in accordance with subsection A of this section, may be spent on opinion-gathering activities and consultant contracts related thereto in accordance with the provisions of Section 2 of this ordinance.

 No Department may spend or encumber appropriated funds on Opinion- gathering Activities unless the Department has complied with the process set forth in this chapter and received approval from the Chairperson, in consultation with Members, to proceed with the Opinion-gathering Activity. For each Opinion-gathering Activity approved pursuant to this chapter, no Department may spend or encumber more appropriated funds than the maximum estimated Cost of that Opinion-gathering Activity indicated in the matrix as approved by the Chairperson.

 A. Initial Approval.

 1. Each Department shall submit a description of anticipated Opinion-gathering Activities using the matrix format shown below, along with supporting materials for each Opinion-gathering Activity, to the Chairperson and each Member.

 DATE & DIVISION/ SCOPE, PURPOSE TARGET TYPE OF RANGE OF TIMELINE PROJECT NAME & AND/OR LOST AUDIENCE RESULTS ESTIMATED MANAGER OPPORTUNITY EXPECTED COSTS

 2. Departments are encouraged to plan Opinion-gathering Activities on a yearly basis and to bring all proposed Opinion- gathering Activities for a calendar year to the Chairperson and Members in one matrix during the first quarter of that budget year. In addition, a Department may submit to the Chairperson and Members a second matrix in the first quarter, one additional matrix in the second quarter, and one final matrix no later than August 31st of the third quarter, for a total of no more than 4 matrices per year. A Department may ask the Chairperson to grant an exception to the quantity and timing requirements of this subsection, which the Chairperson may grant if s/he believes that an exception is warranted and will not unduly burden the Committee.

 3. The Chairperson and Members will review the proposed Opinion- gathering Activities and may request from the Department additional information about each proposed Opinion-gathering Activity until the Chairperson, in consultation with the Members, determines that s/he should approve or reject each Opinion-gathering Activity and its associated range of estimated Costs set forth in the matrix. During the initial approval stage, a Department will provide a Committee briefing on a proposed Opinion-gathering Activity only at the request of the Chairperson or a Member.

 4. After the Chairperson communicates approval of an Opinion- gathering Activity, the Department may proceed to expend appropriated funds to develop or have developed the instrument or questions needed to undertake the Opinion-gathering Activity, but may not expend appropriated funds to administer the instrument or questions except as in described in subsection B of this section.

 5. If the Chairperson communicates a rejection of an Opinion- gathering Activity, the Department may not expend appropriated funds to develop, have developed, administer, or otherwise proceed with the instrument or questions of the Opinion-gathering Activity. The Chairperson, in consultation with the Members, may, but is not required to, reconsider a rejection or consider a modification to a rejected Opinion-gathering Activity upon the request of the Department.

 B. Final Approval.

 1. Prior to administering the instrument or questions, the Department shall submit the Opinion-gathering Activity instrument or questions to the Chairperson and Members for their review.

 2. The Chairperson and Members may request and suggest changes to the instrument or questions.

 3. If the Chairperson gives final approval of the instrument or questions, the Department may spend or encumber appropriated funds up to the maximum Cost estimated in the matrix and may administer the Opinion-gathering Activity as described to the Chairperson and Members.

 4. If the Chairperson rejects the instruments or questions, the Department shall not spend or encumber appropriated funds on the Opinion-gathering Activity.

 5. A Department shall not spend or encumber appropriated funds for expenses in excess of the maximum Cost estimated in the matrix for an Opinion-gathering Activity unless the Department has first provided the Chairperson and Members with a justification for the excess expenditures and the Chairperson has approved the excess Cost.

 C. Reporting of Results.

 1. The Department shall transmit to the Chairperson and Members the Cost and a written copy of the Results of each Opinion-gathering Activity, within 30 days of preparing or receiving the final Results.

 2. After transmitting the final Results, the Department may request an opportunity to brief the Relevant Committee. In addition, the Department shall provide an oral briefing upon the request of the Chairperson or a Member.

 D. Exceptions.

 1. A Department may undertake an Opinion-gathering Activity with a Cost below $2500 without obtaining the approvals required in subsections A and B of this section. Departments are encouraged to include Opinion-gathering Activities with a Cost below $2500 in the matrices they submit to the relevant Committee, even though Committee approval of such Opinion-gathering Activities is not required.

 2. At the conclusion of any Opinion-gathering Activity undertaken pursuant to subsection 1 of this section, the Department must notify the Chairperson and Members in writing of the Cost and Results of each such Opinion-gathering Activity, and, if the Opinion-gathering Activity was never included in a matrix, describe its nature and scope. Opinion-gathering Activities that do not involve the expenditure of appropriated funds are exempt from the provisions of this subsection 2.

 E. Changes to Approved Opinion-gathering Activities.

 1. A Department shall not change the scope, purpose, target audience, range of estimated costs, or other aspect of an Opinion- gathering Activity for which the Chairperson has communicated initial approval pursuant to Section 5.09.030(A) of this chapter without first receiving the Chairperson's approval of such change.

 2. Once an Opinion-gathering Activity has received final approval from the Chairperson pursuant to Section 5.09.030(B) of this chapter, a Department shall not change the substance of the instrument or add, remove, or modify questions without first receiving the Chairperson's approval of such change, addition, removal, or modification.

 5.09.040 Opinion-gathering Required by Ordinance, Contract, Collective Bargaining Agreement, or Law.

 Even though opinion-gathering activities required by ordinance, or by a contract or collective bargaining agreement approved by City ordinance, or otherwise required by law, are excluded from the definition of Opinion-gathering Activity pursuant to Section 5.09.020(I)(6) and are therefore not subject to the approval requirements of this chapter, no Department may spend or encumber appropriated funds on opinion-gathering activities that fall within Section 5.09.020(I)(6) without transmitting to the Chairperson and Members a written copy of the findings, results, data, analysis, report or other product of such opinion-gathering activity within 30 days of preparing or receiving them, along with a statement of the costs of the activity.

 5.09.050 Noncompliance.

 A Chairperson may report any instances of noncompliance with this chapter to the Council President and to the Chairperson of the Finance and Budget Committee. Any such instances may be taken into consideration as part of the Council budget process.

 5.09.060 Duration And Evaluation.

 The Council will reexamine this chapter in 2007 and determine whether the chapter should be amended or repealed.

 Section 3. Any act consistent with the authority of this ordinance taken after Council passage of this ordinance is hereby ratified and confirmed.
