 WHEREAS, the success of small economically disadvantaged businesses is important to the region's overall economy, including the development of job opportunities and social mobility in the City; and

 WHEREAS, economic justice is served by enhancing opportunities for small economically disadvantaged business owners who pursue relevant technical and entrepreneurial training to become more skilled competitors; and

 WHEREAS, small businesses represent a majority of the businesses in the state, provide nearly one-half of all jobs in the state, and are very important to the City's economy and vibrancy; and

 WHEREAS, promoting the use of small economically disadvantaged Businesses, including minority and women-owned businesses and particularly disadvantaged communities, and, can strengthen the City and save money by increasing the pool of qualified public works contractors who submit bids for public projects; and particularly disadvantaged communities; and

 WHEREAS, recognizing the benefits to the City's public works program provides appropriate rationale for spreading the cost of this program among those City departments with CIP projects;

 NOW THEREFORE, BE IT ORDAINED BY THE CITY OF SEATTLE AS FOLLOWS:

 Section 1. Notwithstanding Seattle Municipal Code Ch. 3.114, the Director of the Department of Executive Administration is hereby authorized to enter into an agreement with the Urban League of Metropolitan Seattle in an amount not to exceed Two Hundred Thousand Dollars ($200,000) for the development of a small economically disadvantaged business assistance program. The program will provide assistance, or be a bridge to resources available in the community for professional, managerial, and technical development, and specialized training geared to small construction firms, and will work to identify market opportunities and assist with the development of relationships between small businesses and major contractors, among other competitiveness initiatives.

 Section 2. The Council is committed to the success of this program and therefore recognizes the need for the Urban League to increase the program's budget by raising additional funds from a variety of sources, including other governmental jurisdictions, foundations and private sector contributions. However, the Council also recognizes the need for on-going city support for this effort. It is the intent of the City Council that this program will need only minimal support from the city after a maximum of five years from the date of the contract. To this end, the contract shall contain language that signifies that: A) the city's contribution to the program will gradually decrease to no more than 20% of the project's annual budget within five years from the initial date of the contract. Renewal of the contract is subject to Council appropriation during the bi-annual budget cycle; and,

 B) the City expects the Urban League to seek funding from the Port of Seattle and King County and private sector and is committed to an inter-jurisdictional public-private effort to achieve equity in contracting opportunities.

 Section 3. The Department of Executive Administration is directed to provide an annual report to the City Council on the progress of the program and its objectives. This report shall include both qualitative and quantitative benchmarks of the program's success, as well as information on fundraising and partnering efforts. Because the program relates to the Council's broader objective of increasing the percentage of women and minority business enterprises receiving public works contracts from the City, the report shall also include an assessment of the percentage of work going to these firms and the report may be combined with the report required pursuant to Ordinance 120664.

 Section 4. In order to pay for the necessary costs and expenses incurred or to be incurred for the program noted in Section 1 above, but for which insufficient appropriations were made, the appropriation for the following Line of Business in the 2002 Budget from the fund shown is increased as follows:

 Fund Department Line of Business Amount General Subfund (00100) Finance Finance (C82) $200,000

 to be supported by billings to various capital project funds in proportion to their Capital Improvement Program appropriations as determined by the Director of Finance. Unspent funds so appropriated shall carry forward to subsequent fiscal years until they are exhausted or abandoned by ordinance.

 Section 5. Any act consistent with the authority and prior to the effective date of this ordinance is hereby ratified and confirmed.

 Section 6. In accordance with RCW 35.32A.060, by reason of the facts above stated, the foregoing appropriation is made to meet actual necessary expenditures of the City for which insufficient appropriation has been made due to causes which could not reasonably have been foreseen at the time of the making of the 2002 Budget.

 Section 7. This ordinance shall take effect and be in force thirty (30) days from and after its approval by the Mayor, but if not approved and returned by the Mayor within ten (10) days after presentation, it shall take effect as provided by Municipal Code Section 1.04.020.
