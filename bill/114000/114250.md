 WHEREAS, capital requirements and operating costs of the Water Fund have increased in recent years in response to rehabilitation and repair needs, regulatory requirements, and environmental concerns, with a resulting increase in the revenue requirements of the Water Fund; and

 WHEREAS, the funding for the capital program is dependent on debt financing at favorable interest rates; and

 WHEREAS, a solid bond rating for the Water Fund is important to maintaining ready access to financial capital on favorable terms; and

 WHEREAS, a rate increase in 2002 would improve the Water Fund's financial performance which, in turn, would increase the likelihood that the Water Fund would receive a solid bond rating; and

 WHEREAS, Resolution 28553, adopted July 6, 1992, established general ratemaking policies for water rates; and

 WHEREAS, the water rates authorized by this ordinance are generally consistent with policies set forth in Resolution 28553; and
