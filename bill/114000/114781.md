If, however, the Arbitrator finds the complaint to have been timely filed, then the Arbitrator's role shall be confined to fashioning an appropriate remedy. In fashioning any remedy the Arbitrator may consider but will not be bound by PERC rules, regulations or procedures, but should be primarily concerned with making employees whole and the equities of the situation; and the parties hereby stipulate that restoring the psychologist position is not an appropriate remedy under the circumstances.

 6. Managing the Parking Enforcement Unit is currently bargaining unit work of the Seattle Police Management Association. In the event a determination is made by the City to abrogate the bargaining unit position of Lieutenant in the Parking Enforcement Unit, the parties agree that any and all claims relating to a loss of bargaining unit work by the Association shall be resolved as follows: (1) effective upon the abrogation of the Lieutenant position in the Parking Enforcement Unit, a bargaining unit position of Captain will be created; and (2) in the event a civilian becomes the manager of the Parking Enforcement Unit and the unit remains in the Police Department, that civilian manager will report to the Traffic Section commander or his/her Traffic Lieutenant designee.
