 AN ORDINANCE relating to land use and environmental protection, granting conditional approval of a Campus Master Plan for the development of the University of Washington, rezoning land within the University of Washington Major Institution Overlay boundary, and amending the Official Land Use Map.

 WHEREAS, in 1983 the University of Washington ("University") and the City of Seattle ("City") entered into an agreement, pursuant to Ordinance 111113, which established a process for City review of proposed development by the University; and

 WHEREAS, master plans for the University were approved in 1985, and in 1992, the latest of which was intended to cover the period through 2001; and

 WHEREAS, in 1998 the City and the University approved a new City- University agreement which anticipated the development of a new Campus Master Plan, and extended the effectiveness of the 1992 plan until adoption of a new master plan; and

 WHEREAS, the University, with the participation of the City- University-Community Advisory Committee (CUCAC), developed a proposed Master Plan and submitted the plan to the City in September of 2001; and

 WHEREAS, the City's Department of Design, Construction and Land Use coordinated review of the plan by City departments and on January 17, 2002 issued an analysis and recommendation regarding the plan; and

 WHEREAS, the City Hearing Examiner held four days of hearings on the proposed plan and issued findings and a recommendation on April 1, 2002; and

 WHEREAS, the City Council received the recommendation of the Hearing Examiner concerning the proposed University of Washington CMP; reviewed the record before the Hearing Examiner, held a hearing on the proposal pursuant to the 1998 City-University agreement, and considered the comments received at public hearing; and

 WHEREAS, the City Council Land Use Committee, reviewed a number of issues and made a recommendation to the full City Council, which by Resolution 30496 issued a preliminary recommendation on the plan; and

 WHEREAS, pursuant to the 1998 City-University agreement the City Council has solicited and received comments on its preliminary decision from the University, CUCAC, and persons who submitted petitions for further consideration; and solicited and received responses to those comments from the parties of record in the matter; and

 WHEREAS, the City Council has reconsidered its preliminary decision in light of the comments received; and

 WHEREAS, the City Council appreciates and expects the University to carry-out its commitment to develop a "Guide to Student Community Relations - Neighbor to Neighbor Expectations," that will include the outreach efforts the University is currently engaged in as well as additional items such as a student accountability code, suggestions from the City and community to encourage good neighbor relations, hosting responsible gatherings, alcohol and substance awareness, understanding of and compliance with current City regulations pertaining to noise, litter, parking and other similar issues. This Guide will be an additional tool the University will use to ensure that its students are responsible members of the greater Seattle community; and

 WHEREAS, the Master Plan anticipates an additional 3,000 to 4,000 students, and staff who will live off-campus, creating substantial pressures on housing quality and availability, together with traffic and other neighborhood impacts, City agencies will continue to enforce land use, health and safety standards for student housing in the University District, and the City Council and University will work together to develop housing quality assurance measures such as restricting University listing of substandard housing, providing students with information on tenants' rights, and other remedies.

 Conditions of Approval Seattle City Council Modifications of the University of Washington Campus Master Plan - Seattle Campus

 1) Amend the Campus Master Plan as follows:

 a) Add to the discussion of Potential Development, on page 82 of the proposed Campus Master Plan the following:

 The total permitted gross square feet of development permitted in this plan shall be allocated to four campus areas as defined on pages 11 - 16, as shown in the following table IV-2*. The four areas shall constitute "sectors" for the purposes of Section IIC of the 1998 Agreement between the City of Seattle and the University of Washington:

 Table IV-2

 Allocation of Permitted Floor Area Development

 Campus Area % of Total Campus Permitted 10 Year Development GSF Development Capacity In Campus Area

 Central 53% 1,590,000 gsf

 West 29% 870,000 gsf

 South/Southwest 13% 390,000 gsf

 East 5% 150,000 gsf

 Total 100% 3,000,000 gsf

 The square footage of development may exceed the allocation for each campus area by up to 20% on a cumulative basis over the life of the plan without Plan amendment. Development that would cause the gross square footage for an area to exceed the permitted GSF development for an area by more than 20% on a cumulative basis over the life of the Plan, may be approved as a minor amendment, provided that the 3 million gross square feet for campus development is not exceeded, the change would not result in significantly greater impacts than those contemplated in the EIS for the CMP, and the amendment would be consistent with the CMP Policies.

 *Renumber tables accordingly.

 b) Add the following to the section regarding "Development Process," page 82, after new language recommended by the Hearing Examiner:

 A proposal for a development not previously approved shall constitute an exempt Master Plan change, unless the proposal requires a Plan amendment according to the provisions of the 1998 City-University Agreement, or the DCLU Director determines that the specific use proposed for a site, within the broad use categories permitted in Table IV-3, is inconsistent with the area objectives or general policies of this Campus Master Plan because of the use relationship to, or cumulative use impacts upon, areas surrounding the University boundary. In such cases a Plan amendment shall be required.

 c) Add the following to the section titled "Uses" on page 132 of the Master Plan:

 Uses on each potential development site are limited to those shown in the sixth Column in Table IV-3*, on page 84 of this plan.

 *Currently this table is numbered IV-2, but will be renumbered with the addition of the table allocating development to the four campus areas.

 2. Add [CE1]a new bullet point after the third bullet on page 13 of the Campus Master Plan as follows:

 * If the City of Seattle undertakes planning of landscape improvements for NE Campus Parkway, the University will work with the City and the community to identify landscape improvements that will make NE Campus Parkway more attractive, including a significant upgrading of the environment along NE campus Parkway.

 3. Amend the General Transportation Policies statement on page 33 of the Campus Master Plan as follows:

 The University will continue to act in partnership with King County Metro, Community Transit, and Sound Transit to provide a high level of transit service to the campus, the university area, and nearby  residential and neighborhood business districts.

 4. Amend the introductory statement concerning Objectives by Element on page 10 of the Seattle Campus Master Plan and concerning Objectives by Campus Area on page 11 of the Seattle Campus Master Plan as follows:

 Objectives by element (page 10 of the Seattle Campus Master Plan):

 The Master Plan focuses on three elements: open space, transportation and circulation, and potential development. The objectives that follow represent ideas for change. They also embrace many of the ideas expressed in the University Community Urban Center Plan (UCUCP, August 1998 - See Chapter IX). ~~Future~~ Decisionmakers should strive to achieve these objectives. Costs and schedule related factors will need to be considered in the decision-making process. In some cases, when conflicts occur, there may be need to balance these objectives with other factors such as budget, funding, academic priorities and scheduling. In those cases where factors such as budget, funding, academic priorities, and scheduling result in a decision that is not in accord with the goals stated in the Seattle Campus Master Plan, a full explanation shall be provided for project reviewers and decisionmakers.

 Objectives by campus area (page 11 of the Seattle Campus Master Plan.):

 The objectives that follow represent ideas for change. They also embrace many of the ideas expressed in the University Community Urban Center Plan (UCUCP, August 1998 - see Chapter IX.) ~~Future~~ Decisionmakers should strive to achieve these objectives. Costs and schedule-related factors will need to be considered in the decisionmaking process. In some cases, when conflicts occur, there may be a need to balance these objectives with other factors such as budget, funding, academic priorities and scheduling. In those cases where factors such as budget, funding, academic priorities, and scheduling result in a decision that is not in accord with the goals stated in the Seattle Campus Master Plan, a full explanation shall be provided for project reviewers and decisionmakers.

 5. Add the following to the leasing and acquisition policies on page 127 of the Campus Master Plan:

 The University will limit its real property leasing to the use of office and/or research spaces or land as necessary to carry on the University's educational, research and community services programs that cannot reasonably be accommodated within existing University facilities.

 This means that prior to considering leasing or rental agreements, the University will make reasonable attempts to locate academic and research activities within available and suitable University facilities.

 When existing facilities are not available or suitable, the University will make reasonable attempts to lease in areas where the University- related activity is a use compatible with the existing uses in the area.

 6. Reference baseline leasing and acquisition information as follows:

 Add a new paragraph at the end of the Leasing and Acquisition section on page 127 of the Master Plan as follows:

 Leased property location, amount of space, use, term of lease, and known plans for additional leases or other changes in leasing patterns and plans for acquisitions, as reported in the 2000 Annual report, University of Washington General Physical Development Plan, shall constitute the information required to comply with paragraphs II.E.2.a.and b. of the 1998 City-University Agreement.

 Amend paragraph 3, under "Relationship to Existing Plans, page 5 of the Master Plan as follows:

 The Campus Master Plan ~~will~~does not include the University's plans for branch campuses or off-campus facilities, except for plans for acquisition or leasing of land within the primary and secondary impact zones as provided by Section II.E.2. and 3. of the 1998 City-University Agreement.

 7. Clarify that current trip caps and remedies continue with more limited DCLU discretion by adding the following at the end of text on page 155 of the Master Plan, Section VII Transportation Management Plan:

 A. TRAFFIC - Monitoring, Baselines and Enhancements

 The baseline traffic volumes shall consist of two measures: the campus cordon count shall be based on the average of the years 1988 - 1990 plus a 5% error factor for random variation. The larger University District area will also be based on the average of the years 1988 - 1990, plus an error factor of 6.1% will be applied to account for both random variation and survey variations. University student, faculty and staff trips shall not be allowed to increase beyond any of the following volumes, adjusted downward to exclude visitor and patient trips. Paragraph D describes remedies which may apply if increases occur.

 Baseline Traffic AM [CE2]Peak-period TO CAMPUS 8,267 PM Peak-period FROM CAMPUS 9,782

 And:

 University District Area AM Peak-period (inbound) 10,760 PM Peak-period (outbound) 13,270

 (s) The University shall develop and implement its Enhanced TMP and make changes as needed to achieve the goals of limiting peak-period, peak-direction vehicle trips of students, staff and faculty at or below 1990 levels. The University will choose among the identified TMP measures to maintain or reduce motor vehicle traffic as necessary, and to increase the availability and effectiveness of alternative transportation modes, provided that item (8) Develop Methodology to Replace Cordon Count Monitoring Strategies, and Monitoring Strategies, item (9) below, shall be required[CE5]. Additional measures may be added to the list during the life of the Master Plan if such measures appear likely to further the objectives of limiting vehicular trips and encouraging the use of alternative modes. The following shall be included in the Enhanced TMP:

 (1) Pedestrian Strategies

 * Identify and propose improvements to the local pedestrian network. The City will work with the University to review proposed improvements, such as filling in gaps in the pedestrian network, optimizing signal timing, improving lighting, and enhancing pathways/sidewalks (either by widening or a regular maintenance program).

 * Designate and improve priority pedestrian commuting corridors.

 * Increase pedestrian safety through the use of better lighting and innovative roadway designs (such as raised crossings, curb extensions, and advanced warning signage).

 * Increase marketing of walking as an alternative mode.

 (2) Bicycle Strategies

 * Create additional secured, covered bike lockers and shower facilities on campus to promote bicycle use.

 * Implement a bicycle/pedestrian safety program with measurable goals to help promote the use of bicycles as an alternative mode of travel and raise the awareness level of bicycles on the transportation network.

 * Subsidize bicycle sales or leasing for students, faculty, and staff to help increase bicycle ownership.

 * Coordinate with the City to enhance corridors identified in the Master Plan for use by bicycles.

 * Develop intelligent transportation system solutions to help "track" individual bicycle use to/from campus, which in turn offers parking subsidization for selecting an alternative mode to school/work[CE6].

 (3) Transit Improvement Strategies

 * Encourage transit agencies to increase evening (after 6 PM) service to provide greater user flexibility and use of non-peak service.

 * Seek methods to provide transit ridership subsidies for visitors to the campus and patients at the University of Washington Medical Center.

 * Incorporate Intelligent Transportation System (ITS) solutions such as advanced transit traveler information (kiosks at bus stops/stations to relate "real-time" bus locations and times).

 * Strive to further improve transit service between the Seattle Campus and nearby neighborhoods.

 * Work with King County-Metro, and other transit service providers as appropriate, to provide an equitable share of funding for new transit service and capital improvements designed to serve the University of Washington community.

 (4) High-Occupancy Vehicle (HOV) Strategies

 * Develop "intelligent carpool/vanpool" technology (ITS software) that cross-references zip code and class registration information (time of classes) for students and prints possible ridematch candidates on each student's registration (upon student's approval).

 * Continue to promote carpool and vanpool use through marketing.

 (5) Parking Strategies

 * Increase parking pricing at a higher rate than cost of living increases.

 * Develop graduated parking pricing to create pricing "tiers" for users that allows discounted parking for infrequent users and increased parking fees for frequent users.

 * Emphasize the "just once a week" theme for modes other than SOV and develop ITS technology that allows for a discounted parking price if modes other than SOV are used to access campus.

 (6) Marketing Strategies

 * Focus marketing efforts on new employees.

 * Increase marketing of biking, walking, and carpooling.

 * Link marketing to national modal days (i.e., bike to work day, take transit to work day, etc.).

 * Incorporate walking into promotions.

 * Improve transit information to off-campus sites, visitors and patients.

 (7) Institutional Policies

 * Establish policies and aggressively promote telecommuting, flextime, compressed workweeks and other techniques to reduce peak- period travel. This could include a program for staff and faculty to have computers with high-speed communication access while off campus.

 * Expedite the delivery of the U-PASS to new employees.

 * Direct growth to off-peak quarters (especially summer).

 * Modify and expand faculty/staff housing benefits to favor nearby housing.

 * Partner with developers for off-campus U-District and transit corridor housing development.

 * Increase on-campus student employment to decrease linked SOV trips.

 * Encourage surrounding employers/institutions to implement similar TMP strategies when applicable.

 * Increase student housing development consistent with housing policies.

 * Coordinate with the City so that costs for transportation facilities can be shared in a fair and equitable manner (e.g., district fees, area-wide fees, transportation improvement fees, etc.).

 * Provide transportation orientation packages to new faculty, including but not limited to, information about the U-PASS, to acquaint them with the range of transportation alternatives available in the University District and in Seattle in general.

 * Work with the Faculty Senate or other appropriate bodies to develop faculty-targeted programs to encourage use of alternative modes.

 (8) Develop Methodology to Replace Cordon Count

 Utilizing the monitoring strategies outlined in (9) and others as necessary and appropriate, complete the following:

 * Provide the City an active and ongoing role in: developing, reviewing, and modifying the proposed methodology.

 * Continue conducting cordon count until new methodology has been developed and validated to the satisfaction of City transportation staff.

 * Conduct counts at, or surveys of, University off-campus facilities as needed to accurately estimate all University related trips to the University District, including visitors and patients.

 (9) Monitoring Strategies

 * Provide the City an active and ongoing role in: reviewing data collection instruments (e.g., questionnaires) and monitoring data collection efforts; reviewing results of the various data collection efforts and the methods by which the results are aggregated to produce an overall estimate of campus vehicle trips; and, reviewing significant proposed changes to the TMP.

 * Conduct an annual campus traffic count to evaluate the number of vehicles entering and leaving campus.

 * Conduct a biennial transient parking survey to identify and track non-permit parking inventory usage.

 * Conduct an annual bicycle rack utilization survey and modify location and quantity of bike racks to accommodate demand.

 * Conduct biennial U-PASS telephone surveys. Based on the survey results, calculate all [CE7]University-related trips generated to and from the University District as well as trips by students, staff and faculty.

 * If campus trips increase, implement additional TMP elements to prevent trips calculated from the subsequent survey from exceeding the goals.

 * Conduct supplemental counts and surveys to better understand market segments.

 * Produce and distribute a U-PASS Annual Report that identifies the results of monitoring efforts. Post the monitoring results on the Web.

 * Improve pedestrian, bicycle, and vehicular travel surfaces that service recreation and sports facilities[CE8].

 (10) Other Strategies

 * During the course of this Master Plan, develop packages of TMP mitigation strategies as needed to keep vehicular trips below established caps.

 * Increase parking charges above the annual consumer price index. Adjust parking charges based on changes in vehicular trips as measured by the cordon count program or a replacement monitoring program.

 * Work closely with King County-Metro (and other affected transit service providers) to forecast future demand on specific routes at peak times, and to develop methods of enhancing transit service and providing additional capacity where necessary.

 * Work with King County-Metro to pursue an off-street bus staging facility to accommodate increased layover demand and to relieve competition for curbside street use in the University District.

 * Baseline trip limits (caps) shall be adjusted downward by the appropriate percentages to hold the caps constant for students, faculty and staff.

 19. The University shall prepare and deliver to the Department of Design, Construction and Land Use a compiled Campus Master Plan that incorporates the amendments contained in these Conditions of Approval. ta
