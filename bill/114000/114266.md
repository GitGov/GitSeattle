 AN ORDINANCE relating to implementation of Seattle Public Utilities' open reservoir covering program; authorizing Seattle Public Utilities, subject to completion of environmental review, to replace certain existing City reservoirs with underground reservoirs; allocating cost responsibilities for the development of these projects between Seattle Public Utilities and Seattle Parks and Recreation thereby limiting the cost to be borne by the water rates; calling for a study of design- build contracting options for the construction of underground reservoirs; amending Ordinance 118477 (Initiative 42) to exempt from its limitations and requirements any open space created by replacing existing above ground reservoirs with underground reservoirs; calling for a study of options for funding future underground reservoir projects; amending SMC 25.12.670 to exempt City-owned reservoirs from the requirement that a certificate of approval be obtained from the Landmarks Preservation Board restrictions prior to making alterations or significant changes to a designated landmark.

 WHEREAS, Seattle Public Utilities is responsible for providing safe, reliable drinking water service to approximately 1.3 million people in the greater Seattle metropolitan area; and

 WHEREAS, the distribution system reservoirs operated by Seattle Public Utilities play an integral part in delivering safe, reliable water service to City residents and businesses; and

 WHEREAS, the City has previously committed to a reservoir covering program for its remaining open reservoirs for the purposes of enhancing water quality and securing the City's drinking water from contamination and in order to comply with state water quality regulations; and

 WHEREAS, it is possible that substantial cost saving could be realized through the use of a design-build process for such reservoir replacement projects; and

 WHEREAS, replacing the City's open reservoirs with underground reservoirs provides a unique opportunity to create additional open space throughout the City, but, insofar as the creation such open space would be funded by water rates, it should not be subject to the restrictions on changes in use applicable to other park lands and open space under existing City law, and the funding of active recreational uses or other park facilities should be derived from other sources; and

 BE IT ORDAINED BY THE CITY OF SEATTLE AS FOLLOWS:

 Section 1. Seattle Public Utilities (SPU) is hereby authorized to fund the Volunteer Park and Beacon reservoir replacement projects to be set forth in the revised SPU Capital Improvement Program budget for 2003-2008.

 Section 2. The Executive is hereby directed to study and submit for the Council's consideration a range of funding options for the remaining reservoir covering projects at Myrtle Reservoir, West Seattle Reservoir, Maple Leaf Reservoir and Roosevelt Reservoir, including an option that limits the amount to be paid through water rates to the cost of installing floating covers, with any additional amounts necessary to construct underground replacement reservoirs provided through alternative funding sources.

 Section 3. Prior to advertising for bid any contract for the design or construction of replacement reservoirs for the Volunteer Park and Beacon reservoirs, SPU shall commission a study of design-build contracting procedures as a possible contracting option for the reservoir replacement projects. The study should recommend a schedule for completing the reservoir projects by 2020. If such study shows that the cost savings of a design-build approach over conventional design-bid-build approach are likely to exceed 15% of total project costs, SPU shall, prior to advertising for bid any design or construction contract, present to the Council for its consideration and approval pursuant to RCW Chapter 39.10 a proposal for utilizing a design-build process for some or all of the remaining reservoir replacement projects. In addition, SPU will provide a report to Council on January 2006 which details the costs and project experience to date on the reservoirs. The Council will use this information to determine what changes, if any, are necessary to the program.

 Section 4. The replacement reservoirs provided for herein shall be designed and constructed so that the chlorine facilities and other essential access best serve the reliability and safety of the water supply system, as determined by SPU. Each underground reservoir shall be designed so that the completed project site can accommodate a reasonable range of future active recreational and passive park uses, provided, however, that any cost incurred after the effective date of this Ordinance for any Park master planning process related to the development of park facilities at any reservoir site (including but not limited to the development of any proposed "water feature") shall be responsibility of the Department of Parks and Recreation. SPU shall only be responsible for, and the Water Fund shall only be used for funding a project amount necessary to plan and complete the project with an earth covering and grass or low maintenance planting with irrigation as needed to allow for passive public use, provided that costs for installing an irrigation system would be provided by Park funds and installation would only proceed if Parks approves it as part of the long range plan. SPU may contract with the Department of Parks and Recreation or another service provider for lawn mowing services. Any additional landscaping or recreational use shall be the responsibility of the Department of Parks and Recreation and shall be planned, designed, constructed and maintained at sole cost of the Department of Parks and Recreation from funds appropriated and available for such purposes. For each such project, SPU and shall enter into a lease or use agreement with the Department of Parks and Recreation with respect to access, liability, security and other relevant issues.

 Section 5. Section 1 of Ordinance 118477 (Initiative 42) is hereby amended to read as follows:

 All lands and facilities held now or in the future by The City of Seattle for park and recreation purposes, whether designated as park, park boulevard, or open space, shall be preserved for such use; and no such land or facility shall be sold, transferred, or changed from park use to another usage, unless the City shall first hold a public hearing regarding the necessity of such a transaction and than enact an ordinance finding that the transaction is necessary because there is no reasonable and practical alternative and the City shall at the same time or before receive in exchange land or a facility of equivalent or better size, value, location and usefulness in the vicinity, serving the same community and the same park purposes; provided, however, that, except in the case of Volunteer reservoir (which is located on City park property), any open space or park lands or facilities located in the space created by the replacement of above-ground city reservoirs with underground reservoirs shall be exempt from the foregoing restrictions, limitations and requirements.

 Section 6. This ordinance shall take effect and be in force thirty (30) days from and after its approval by the Mayor, but if not approved and returned by the Mayor within ten (10) days after presentation, it shall take effect as provided by Municipal Code Section 1.04.020.
