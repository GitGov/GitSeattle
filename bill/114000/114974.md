 WHEREAS, Sound Transit (formally known as the Central Puget Sound Regional Transit Authority) is proceeding to implement Sound Move, the regional transit system plan approved by voters in November, 1996; and

 WHEREAS, Sound Move includes the Link electric light rail line connecting the cities of SeaTac, Tukwila and Seattle; and
