 This Public Access and Maintenance Agreement and Maximum Building Height Agreement (this "Agreement") is made this ___day of __________, 2004, by Dexter Lake Union, L.L.C. ("Owner") in favor of the City of Seattle, a municipal corporation of the State of Washington (the "City").

 R E C I T A L S:

 Owner is vested in fee simple title and/or has a substantial beneficial interest in the real property situated in King County, Washington, legally described on Exhibit A hereto (the "Apartment Property") and on Exhibit B hereto (the "Dexter Deli Building Property").

 On October 11, 1999, the Seattle City Council voted to conditionally grant a petition to vacate Dexter Court North located within the Apartment Property as more particularly described in City Clerk File 302881 (the "Conditional Vacation"), for the construction of an apartment building on the Apartment Property (the "Project").

 Pursuant to condition 2 of the Conditional Vacation, Owner is required to provide a view corridor subject to a maximum building height covenant on the Dexter Deli Building Property.

 Pursuant to condition 4 of the Conditional Vacation, Owner was required to (1) construct pedestrian stairs, landscaping and view platform with benches in the Highland Drive right-of-way, (2) construct pedestrian stairs and landscaping in the Comstock Street right-of-way, and (3) provide a public plaza on Dexter Avenue North. The public plaza is located upon the Apartment Property. The description of the public plaza is attached hereto as Exhibit C and by this reference incorporated herein (the "Public Access Area").

 Owner now seeks final vacation of Dexter Court North.

 AGREEMENT

 Now, therefore, the Owner hereby covenants, bargains and agrees on behalf of itself, its successors and assigns as follows:

 Section 1. The Owner hereby covenants that the existing Dexter Deli building on the Dexter Deli Building Property may be retained, but any future redevelopment on the southern forty (40) feet of the Dexter Deli Building Property shall be limited in height to no more than two stories in order to protect view from the view platform on Highland Drive. This covenant shall last for the life of the Project.

 Section 2. The Owner hereby grants to the City, for the benefit of the public, a right of public access over and across the Public Access Area as described in Exhibit C.

 Section 3. Owner shall have the right from time to time to temporarily close or obstruct the Public Access Area for required maintenance and repair or because of circumstances beyond Owner's control. Owner may adopt and enforce such reasonable rules and regulations regarding the use of, and access to, the Public Access Area as Owner reasonably deems necessary to ensure the safety or security of the residents and tenants of the building located on the Apartment Property and users of the Public Access Area, including but not limited to rules and regulations similar to those applicable to other locations in the City of Seattle.

 Section 4. To the full extent of Owner's negligence, as well as the negligence of agents and employees of Owner, Owner agrees to indemnify, hold harmless and defend the City and its officers, agents and employees from and against any and all claims, losses, costs and damages including without limitation personal injury, death, property damage, loss of use, and attorneys' fees, arising out of or relating to public use of the Public Access Area during Owner's ownership of the Apartment Property. This agreement to indemnify, hold harmless and defend the City and its officers, agents and employees shall be binding upon Owner's successors and assigns during each of their respective ownerships of the Apartment Property.

 Section 5. Owner hereby acknowledges the on-going responsibility as owner of the Apartment Property to provide and maintain the public benefit aspects of the project sited on the Apartment Property, which include maintenance and/or replacement of the landscaping on the Highland Drive and Comstock Street rights-of-way, the bench on the Highland Drive view platform, the decorative art details of the stairs and retaining walls, and the Public Access Area. These responsibilities are congruent with the permission granted in Seattle Department of Transportation Street Use Type 45 Permit # X7358.

 Section 6.

 Section 7. This Agreement may be amended or modified by agreement between Owner and City; provided such amended agreement shall be approved by the legislative authority of the City by ordinance. Nothing in this Agreement shall be construed as a surrender of the City's governmental powers.

 Section 8. This Agreement grants a right of access to the public for the benefit of the City and the City may institute and prosecute any proceeding at law or in equity to enforce this Agreement. This Agreement shall not grant any private right of enforcement to any individual member of the public.

 Section 9. Owner reserves the right to use the Public Access Area for any purpose which does not interfere with the public's use of the Public Access Area, including but not limited to the right to use the subsurface for construction, building spaces, support or tieback and the right to grant easements within the Public Access Area.

 Section 10. Notwithstanding the covenants contained herein, nothing in this Agreement shall constitute a public dedication of any portion of the Apartment Property or the Dexter Deli Building Property.

 Section 11. In the event any covenant or condition hereinabove contained, or any portion thereof, is invalid or void, such invalidity or avoidance shall in no way affect any other covenant, condition or restriction herein contained.
