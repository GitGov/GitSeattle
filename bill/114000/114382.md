 AN ORDINANCE relating to signs on public property, amending Seattle Municipal Code Chapters 15.12 and 15.48 to regulate the posting of signs on City-owned utility poles, lamp poles and traffic control devices that the court has held to be a traditional public forum.

 WHEREAS, in 1994, the City of Seattle adopted Ordinance number 117066, which among other things, prohibited anyone from affixing any handbill, sign, or poster to any utility poles, lamp poles and traffic control devices; and

 WHEREAS, on August 5, 2002, the Washington State Court of Appeals declared that Ordinance number 117066, now codified as Seattle Municipal Code 15.48.100, as it relates to utility poles, lamp poles and traffic control devices, violates Article 1, Section 5, of the Washington State Constitution to the extent that it prohibits signs in a traditional public forum, but also held that the time, place and manner of the use of this public forum can be regulated to effect the public purposes the City identified in that ordinance; and

 WHEREAS, the City of Seattle has filed a petition in the Washington State Supreme Court for review of the Court of Appeals decision, but nevertheless wishes to protect the public interest by regulating the time, place, and manner of displaying handbills, sign, and posters on utility poles, lamp poles and traffic control devices for as long as they are deemed to be a traditional public forum by the court, but does not intend to create a dedicated public forum by this ordinance; and

 WHEREAS, all members of the public should have reasonable opportunity and access to exercise their rights to use a traditional public forum; and

 WHEREAS, signs contribute to traffic hazards and visual blight and it has been the City's policy to ban all signs, except as allowed in Seattle Municipal Code chapter 23.55, the Sign Code, and Title 11, the Traffic Code; and

 WHEREAS, signs posted on utility poles, lamp poles and traffic control devices may additionally contribute to traffic hazards, including hazards to pedestrians and bicyclists, due to both the proximity of these sites to sidewalks and streets and the distraction from traffic safety and control messages that are posted on the same poles; and

 WHEREAS, allowing signs to be posted on utility poles, lamp poles and traffic control devices may allow signs in zones where they are currently prohibited or may result in more signs being displayed than allowed under current zoning, which contributes to visual blight and/or traffic hazards; and

 WHEREAS, outdated signs, torn signs and litter can contribute to visual blight; and

 WHEREAS, the designation of utility poles, lamp poles and traffic control devices as a traditional public forum by the court provides an additional purpose for allowing signs, including off-premises commercial speech, that are otherwise banned or limited by the City, without diminishing the City's interests in regulating signs to promote its traffic safety and aesthetic purposes; and

 WHEREAS, stop signs and yield signs in the City of Seattle that are erected on their own poles are designed so that the back of the sign and the entire post supporting the sign are part of the traffic control message, with the result that placing a handbill, sign, or poster on the sign pole or on the backside of the sign would interfere with its traffic control message in violation of Seattle Municipal Code, Title 11, the Traffic Code; and

 WHEREAS, the benefits of providing access to a traditional public forum can be advanced and the negative impacts of using these utility poles, lamp poles and traffic control devices as a traditional public forum can be limited by regulating the material used for the signs, the manner of affixing the signs, the size of the signs, the location of the signs, the duration of their posting, and their removal and by allowing them to be posted at an accessible height under 12 feet above the surface of the ground;

 WHEREAS, prompt enactment of regulations will promote these public interests;

 NOW, THEREFORE,

 Section 1. Subsection 15.12.010A of the Seattle Municipal Code is amended as follows:
