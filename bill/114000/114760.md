 AN ORDINANCE relating to land use and zoning, amending Sections 23.41.004, 23.41.014, 23.71.004, 23.71.008, 23.71.014, 23.71.020, 23.71.028, 23.71.029, 23.76.004, and 23.76.026; adding new Sections 23.71.031 and 23.71.032; and giving direction for the development of a Joint Director's Rule, all relating to the Northgate Overlay District.

 WHEREAS, Policy 13 of the Northgate Area Comprehensive Plan states that General Development Plans (GDPs) shall be required to ensure that the development of super-blocks in the Northgate Area supports and reinforces the vehicular/pedestrian balance envisioned to complement transit use in the Northgate Overlay; and

 WHEREAS, GDP elements are intended to help promote pedestrian circulation by establishing a functional and attractive pedestrian network, efficient vehicle circulation that minimizes disruption to pedestrian circulation, adequate amenities such as landscaping and open space to encourage use of the pedestrian network, development compatible with adjacent areas, and conditions that support increased use of transit or other alternatives to single-occupant vehicles; and

 WHEREAS, experience with the GDP provisions of the Northgate Overlay District has revealed the need to amend procedural requirements in order to: maximize GDP effectiveness as a tool to implement the Northgate Area Comprehensive Plan; clarify the lines of authority and responsibility in GDP decision making; increase effectiveness from citizen input; promote early citizen input into design review; and set up a GDP process that functions clearly and effectively, NOW THEREFORE,

 Department of Planning and Development Publication: Effective: /Department of Neighborhoods

 Subject: Code and Section Reference: 23.71.028 Northgate General Development Plan Advisory Committee/Notice Requirements

 Type of Rule: Code Interpretation

 Index: Land Use Code Ordinance Authority: 3.060.040 SMC

 Background:

 In 1993 the Northgate Area Comprehensive Plan and amendments to the Land Use Code created the Northgate Overlay District and a requirement for sites six acres or larger to gain approval for development by means of a General Development Plan (GDP). Approval of the GDP is a Type II decision made by the Director of the Department of Planning and Development (DPD) and is subject to appeal to the Hearing Examiner. The process for a GDP includes a provision for an advisory committee to advise the Director in making a decision on a GDP. The Land Use Code provides as follows:

 Section 23.71.028C states:

 1. An Advisory Committee to the Director shall be established by the Council to review proposed GDPs and major amendments to GDPs.

 2. The role of the Advisory Committee is to provide comments and recommendations to the Director as to the consistency of a proposed GDP or proposed GDP major amendment with the Northgate Area Comprehensive Plan and the provisions of this chapter.

 3. The Advisory Committee shall perform the following tasks:

 a. Provide comments and recommendations to the Design Review Board as part of the early design guidance process for approval of the GDP;~~~~

b. Review the contents of a proposed GDP or GDP major amendment;

c. Consider the Design Review Board's guidance in the Advisory Committee's recommendations;

 d. Solicit and consider public comments on a proposed GDP or GDP major amendment and hold at least one public meeting to solicit public comment;

 e. Solicit and consider public comments on a Director's draft decision, if issued, and hold at least one public meeting to solicit public comment on a Director's draft decision; and

f. Within a time period established by the Director, submit written comments and recommendations including any suggested changes or additions to the Director regarding the proposed GDP, major amendment or a Director's draft decision. Failure to provide timely comments shall not be the basis for an appeal of the Director's decision.

4. Upon receipt of an application for approval of a GDP or for design guidance on a GDP, the Director of the Department of Planning and Development shall transmit to the Director of the Department of Neighborhoods a copy of the application. Upon receipt of the application, the Department of Neighborhoods shall initiate the establishment of the Advisory Committee. The Department of Neighborhoods shall develop a list of potential members to serve on the Advisory Committee based on the qualifications contained in subsection 5 of this section. The Director of the Department of Neighborhoods shall forward a set of potential members to the City Council.

 5. The committee shall consist of at least nine (9) and no more than fifteen (15) voting members. Advisory Committee members shall be selected using the following criteria:

 a. Members shall be Seattle residents, except business and development interest members, who need not reside, but must work for or own a business in Seattle; and

 b. Members shall be a balanced group representing all interests and may be selected for appointment to the Advisory Committee from area community councils and City-sponsored district councils, residents, property owners, and businesspersons.

6. The City Council shall appoint the members of the committee by resolution. The City Council may make changes in the size and/or composition of the Advisory Committee, within the size range contained in subsection 5 of this section, or remand the matter to the Department of Neighborhoods for further action.

 7. If the GDP is approved, the Committee has no further duties, except for the consideration of major amendments to the GDP, as provided in section 23.71.028G and 23.71.028C (10), below.

8. The Director shall reconvene the Advisory Committee for the purpose of reviewing major amendments. If necessary, new members will be appointed in the same manner as the original committee. The Advisory Committee shall be governed by the joint Directors' rules established for the conduct of Advisory Committees for the consideration of new GDPs. The Advisory Committee shall be given the opportunity to review a proposed major amendment, including providing comments and recommendations on any early design guidance required for a major amendment. The Advisory Committee also shall be given the opportunity to submit comments on what conditions (if any) should be imposed. The Director shall consider the comments and recommendations of the Advisory Committee.

Rule

 1. Groups from which members may be selected for appointment to the advisory committee will include community organizations, including the Northgate Chamber of Commerce, residents, property owners, and business persons in the Northgate area. Committee membership will be balanced among these groups. Members should possess expertise or experience in neighborhood issues, community development, traffic and transportation, land use and zoning, architecture or landscape architecture, economic development, or building development. The applicant, a representative of DPD, and a representative of the Seattle Department of Transportation (SDOT) will be non-voting, ex- officio members of the Advisory Committee. A representative of Seattle Public Utilities may be an additional non-voting, ex-officio member of the Advisory Committee if needed.

 2. Members of the advisory committee will have no direct economic relationship with the applicant for the project under review, except for the applicant's representative. Representatives of lessees and tenants of the applicant will not be considered to have an economic relationship with the applicant.

 Meetings of the GDP Advisory Committee will be held at accessible and convenient locations and times in the evenings or at other convenient times for community residents and businesses in the vicinity of the GDP site. Committee meetings will be open to the general public. Contact information for DON staff and Advisory Committee, if available, will be posted on DON's website.

 3. Notice to the Advisory Committee and the Public: DPD will provide copies of the initially proposed GDP to libraries, community centers, and community service centers within the Northgate Overlay District. The Director will require large signs giving notice of a proposed GDP where appropriate to assist in providing meaningful public notice of the project. This will include at least one sign on sides of a site that front on an arterial, unless circumstances render a sign in such a location ineffective. DPD and DON staff will provide notice of a proposed GDP or request for early design guidance to members of the Advisory Committee, once established, interested governmental units, district councils, community councils, libraries and community centers within the Northgate Overlay District.

 4. The Committee will be staffed by DON who will provide assistance to the Advisory Committee in performing its functions, including preparation of its report and recommendations. The Advisory Committee, with the assistance of DON staff, will consider and may adopt rules of order, including voting procedure, selection of chairpersons, process for soliciting public comment, time of day and location where the Advisory Committee shall meet, and methods of conflict resolution. DPD, SDOT and DON will provide technical assistance to the committee.

 5. The Committee will meet as necessary to accomplish the following tasks:

 - Orientation of the Advisory Committee as to duties, requirements, rules of procedure and timelines.

 - Applicant presentation. The applicant will present to the committee an overview of the proposed GDP. This presentation will serve as background for the committee's understanding and future review of the proposal and will provide an opportunity for committee members to discuss with the applicant issues of concern to the community.

 - The meeting where the applicant presents the GDP overview may also be a joint meeting between the Advisory Committee and Design Review Board where the Advisory Committee and the Design Review Board will be co-convened to hear a presentation by the applicant.

 - Review of the proposed GDP. The committee will hold at least one meeting with the applicant in attendance to review the proposed GDP, clarify the plan's contents and to solicit public comments on the proposed GDP.

 - Comments on the plan. The advisory committee will meet and prepare, with DON staff support, comments on the proposed GDP and will submit them to the Director within 10 weeks of receipt of the proposed GDP.

 6. Within 6 weeks from the presentation by the applicant to the Advisory Committee of the first meeting of or joint meeting of the Advisory Committee and Design Review Board, the Advisory Committee will forward its comments to the Design Review Board. The Design Review Board will consider the Advisory Committee's comments as the Design Review Board drafts its Early Design Guidelines. Failure of the Advisory Committee to transmit its comments to the Design Review Board or a decision by the Advisory Committee not to transmit comments will not be cause for the Design Review Board to not issue early design guidance to the applicant.

 7. Notice to Advisory Committee Regarding Changes to Proposed GDPs. Proposed changes to the proposed GDP under consideration by the Advisory Committee that are received more than 7 days prior to an Advisory Committee meeting will be transmitted by the assigned DPD planner or DON to the Advisory Committee. Changes received by the DPD assigned planner within seven (7) days prior to an Advisory Committee meeting will be transmitted to the Advisory Committee by the time of the meeting.

 8. The Director of DPD will post the initially proposed and the final approved General Development Plan, proposed major amendments to the GDP, and the Director's draft decisions, if issued, on DPD's website. The final approved version of the Plan will be maintained on the website for 90 days. The applicant will be required to submit the initially proposed and final approved version of the GDP in .pdf format, at screen resolution and at 100% scale. Formal public notice regarding proposed GDPs will include the Internet address where the GDP document can be located. Failure to post the GDP or major amendments to the GDP on DCLU's website or omission of the Internet address shall not be a basis for an appeal of the Director's decision.
