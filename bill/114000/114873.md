 AN ORDINANCE approving the horizontal and vertical alignment and locations of the monorail guideway, monorail transit stations, and monorail operations center for the Seattle Popular Monorail Authority's Green Line monorail transit system in the City of Seattle.

 WHEREAS, the Seattle Popular Monorail Authority ("Seattle Monorail Project") is a city transportation authority created pursuant to chapter 35.95A RCW; and

 WHEREAS, in 2002, pursuant to state law, voters in Seattle approved Citizens' Petition No. 1, which created the Seattle Monorail Project, approved the Seattle Popular Monorail Plan earlier adopted by the Elevated Transportation Company, and provided for financing for phase one of the Seattle Popular Monorail Plan, which phase includes an approximately 14-mile-long monorail transit line known as the Seattle Monorail Project Green Line ("Green Line"); and

 WHEREAS, the Seattle Monorail Project, in cooperation with the United States Coast Guard, has jointly issued a draft and final Environmental Impact Statement ("EIS") pursuant to the National Environmental Policy Act and the State Environmental Policy Act for the Green Line proposal; and

 WHEREAS, on March 29, 2004, the Seattle Monorail Project Board selected the location of and authorized the implementation of the Green Line monorail guideway alignment, stations and operations center; and

 WHEREAS, in September 2003, the City Council passed Ordinance 121278, which established a permitting and approval system for monorail transit facilities, and which stated that such permits and approvals may be issued "only if the horizontal and vertical alignment and locations of the monorail guideway, monorail transit stations, and monorail operations center have been approved by the City Council by ordinance or resolution" (codified at Seattle Municipal Code (SMC) 23.80.004.D.2; similar language in SMC 15.54.020.B); and

 WHEREAS, in September 2003, the City Council adopted Resolution 30629, in which it stated its intent to consider several factors when reviewing the monorail alignment, including but not limited to consistency with design guidelines, acceptability of construction sequencing, and evidence that the Green Line can be built within budget; and

 WHEREAS, because there is not yet enough information to consider fully the factors set forth in Resolution 30629, the Council intends to approve the alignment now with the conditions stated in Sections 3 through 12 below, and may grant future Council approvals or authorizations on further consideration of those factors; NOW, THEREFORE,

 BE IT ORDAINED BY THE CITY OF SEATTLE AS FOLLOWS:

 Section 1. For purposes of Seattle Municipal Code (SMC) 15.54.020.B and SMC 23.80.004.D.2, and subject to Sections 3 through 14 below, the horizontal and vertical alignment and locations of the monorail guideway, monorail transit stations, and monorail operations center for the Green Line monorail transit system are approved as described in Exhibit A if they comply with the following:

 A. Above-ground structures of monorail guideways and monorail transit stations (as defined in SMC 23.84.025) are approved only if:

 (1) located (a) within the horizontal envelope defined by the dashed lines labeled "limits of alignment approval" in the plan view drawings in Exhibit B1 and (b) below the dashed lines labeled "limits of alignment approval" in the profile drawings in Exhibit B1; and

 (2) their location does not cause the dynamic envelope of a monorail transit train to extend beyond the dashed lines labeled "limits of alignment approval" in the plan view drawings in Exhibit B1.

 Below-grade structures and straddle bent structures may extend outside the horizontal envelope defined by the "limits of alignment approval" in the plan view drawings in Exhibit B1 only if the Director of Transportation or the Director of Planning and Development determines that they are necessary to support the monorail guideways or other monorail transit facilities and approves their locations in permits issued by the Seattle Department of Transportation or the Department of Planning and Development.

 B. Notwithstanding the preceding subsection A., monorail transit stations (as defined in SMC 23.84.025) and a monorail operations center are approved only if located:

 (1) within the horizontal envelope defined by the dashed lines labeled "limits of alignment approval" in the plan view drawings in Exhibit B1 or within the areas labeled "property identified for station" or "property identified for operation center," respectively, in Exhibit B2; and

 (2) below the dashed lines labeled "limits of alignment approval" in the profile drawings in Exhibit B1.

 C. In the event of a conflict between the description in Exhibit A and the drawings in Exhibit B, Exhibit B shall control.

 Other notes and indicators on Exhibits B1 and B2, other than the "limits of alignment approval," "property identified for station," and "property identified for operation center," are not part of the approval described above. Neither Exhibit B1 nor Exhibit B2 specifies the final, engineered location of the Green Line.

 Section 2. The approval described in Section 1 does not constitute the City's consent for use of its property, including rights-of-way, for the purposes of RCW 35.95A.050(1).

 Section 3. Development of the Green Line monorail transit system that is the subject of the approval described in Section 1 shall be consistent with a transit way agreement that is anticipated to be authorized by the City Council and then executed by the City and the Seattle Monorail Project.

 Section 4. On Second Avenue and on Second Avenue Extension South, the minimum clearance between the monorail vehicle dynamic envelope and the abutting property line shall be 14 feet, with one foot variance allowed either way (13 to 15 feet) for design flexibility, provided that this minimum clearance shall not apply where the Monorail Guideway curves east as it approaches Stewart Street and curves west as it approaches 3rd Avenue South. The priorities for design and allocation of the public right-of-way on Second Avenue and on Second Avenue Extension South shall be, in the following order:

 Priority Level I

 1. Pedestrians and sidewalks - existing sidewalk widths shall be required to be maintained or increased on each side of the street;

 2. Bus lanes;

 3. Dedicated Bicycle Lane on Second Avenue and on Second Avenue Extension South - shall be maintained, or re-established southbound on an alternative avenue through downtown, provided that if the bicycle lane is moved, the lane must be re-established prior to closure of the Second Avenue lane;

 4. Balance Guideways concentrically over Columns and Minimize Guideway Column widths wherever technically feasible - this may be achieved through use of design and engineering with high strength steel and concrete and/or increasing the number of columns to reduce loads per column.

 Priority Level II

 1. General Purpose Traffic Lanes; and

 2. On-street parking.

 Section 5. On Harrison Street, the minimum clearance between the monorail vehicle dynamic envelope and the abutting property line shall be ten feet, provided that this minimum clearance shall not apply where the monorail guideway curves north near the west end of Harrison Street as it approaches Elliott Avenue, nor where the monorail guideway curves north near the east end of Harrison Street as it approaches 1st Avenue N. Either a south-side-of-street alignment or a center-of-street alignment or a combination of these two is approved, within the bounds shown in Exhibit B. The Seattle Monorail Project shall analyze these alignments and their impacts and shall work with SDOT and the community, and then SMP shall decide the final alignment.

 Section 6. On California Avenue SW, the minimum clearance between the monorail vehicle dynamic envelope and the abutting property line shall be ten feet, provided that this minimum clearance shall not apply where the monorail guideway curves east as it approaches SW Edmunds Street.

 Section 7. On 15th Avenue NW, the minimum clearance between the monorail vehicle dynamic envelope and the abutting property line shall be six feet, provided that this minimum clearance shall not apply where the monorail guideway curves west as it approaches the crossing of the Lake Washington Ship Canal.

 Section 8. On 35th Avenue SW, the minimum clearance between the monorail vehicle dynamic envelope and the abutting property line shall be 20 feet, provided that this minimum clearance shall not apply where the monorail guideway curves west as it approaches SW Alaska Street, nor where the monorail guideway curves east as it approaches SW Avalon Way.

 Section 9. SMP shall work with the DBOM contractor to achieve greater than 6 feet between the dynamic envelope and property lines where prudent and technically feasible to do, consistent with the Council and SMP Board's direction to date in regard to balancing competing needs.

 Section 10. During design of the Green Line segment near King Street Station, the Seattle Monorail Project must work with the Washington State Department of Transportation (WSDOT), Burlington Northern Santa Fe (BNSF), Amtrak, Sound Transit, King County, and other relevant parties, to: (1) provide reasonable accommodation for possible future railroad track and platform expansion to accommodate growth in passenger rail, including Amtrak and Sounder service; (2) minimize negative impacts to King Street Station related to ingress and egress, taxis, parking, and buses; and (3) minimize negative impacts to the historic integrity and character of the structure.

 Section 11. An elevated station connection from a station on the west side of 5th Avenue between Virginia Street and Stewart Street to Westlake Center or any other location south of Stewart Street is approved only if the City Council first grants a skybridge permit for that elevated connection pursuant to Seattle Municipal Code chapter 15.64, Skybridge Permits.

 Section 12. For the Elliott & Mercer station, the Seattle Monorail Project shall analyze both a vertical station and a side-by-side station, and shall work with the community, and then SMP shall decide the final station configuration.

 Section 13. When the Seattle Department of Transportation and the Department of Planning and Development review applications for monorail transit facilities pursuant to SMC 15.54.020 and SMC 23.80.004 for consistency with monorail transit system design guidelines, they shall pay special attention to locations and design of switches and straddle bent structures and the extent to which they are consistent with the design guidelines in sections I.A. and I.C. of Exhibit A to Ordinance 121446.

 Section 14. Notwithstanding Section 1, for each monorail segment for which this ordinance states a minimum clearance between the monorail vehicle dynamic envelope and the abutting property line, no monorail transit facilities may be located in the minimum clearance area unless they are also (a) reviewed through City design review and permitting processes and approved by the Director of Transportation or the Director of Planning and Development, or (b) deemed necessary for safety reasons by the Director of Transportation or the Director of Planning and Development.

 Section 15. This ordinance shall take effect and be in force thirty (30) days from and after its approval by the Mayor, but if not approved and returned by the Mayor within ten (10) days after presentation, it shall take effect as provided by Municipal Code Section 1.04.020.

 EXHIBIT A

 General Description of Monorail Transit System Alignment and Locations of the Monorail Guideway, Stations, and Operations Center

 Introduction to and Purpose of Exhibit A

 Exhibit A is a general description of the alignment and locations of monorail transit facilities (as defined in Seattle Municipal Code (SMC) 23.84.025) for the Green Line monorail transit system.

 As used in this Exhibit A, the "side" of a City street means the general location, either east, west, north, or south of the center line of the street, within which monorail guideway columns may be approved for construction by the Seattle Department of Transportation. The approved locations of monorail guideway columns located on the "side" of a City street will typically be limited to the parking or travel lane adjacent to existing curbs, or to the existing sidewalk or planted area, on that side of the street. The approved location of monorail guideway columns located in the "center" of a City street will typically be limited to existing travel lanes that are not adjacent to existing curbs.
