 WHEREAS, the City of Seattle Consumer Affairs Program protects businesses from unfair competition by enforcing the accuracy of advertising, unit pricing, weighing and measuring devices, price scanning systems and package net contents; by investigating unit pricing issues and other consumer complaints; and by providing training for businesses, and

 WHEREAS, the City of Seattle Consumer Affairs Program is one of the premiere programs in the nation; and

 WHEREAS, the City of Seattle, because of budget considerations, intends to increasingly fund the Consumer Affairs Program through fees; and

 WHEREAS, the current fees that help support the Consumer Affairs Program do not cover the cost of the Program; and

 WHEREAS, it is the intention of the City to seek legislation to permit cities that operate their own consumer affairs programs to establish fees to recover their costs; and

 WHEREAS, it has been determined by the Seattle City Council that, until legislation is passed by the State Legislature and the Governor to allow the City of Seattle to set fees to recover Program costs, the gap in funding the Consumer Affairs Program should be borne by all businesses by means of a surcharge on the annual business license; and

 WHEREAS, it is the intention of the Seattle City Council to repeal this surcharge at such time as fees can be adjusted to recover a greater portion of the costs of operating the Consumer Affairs Program; NOW, THEREFORE,

 BE IT ORDAINED BY THE CITY OF SEATTLE AS FOLLOWS:
