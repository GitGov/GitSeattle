 AN ORDINANCE relating to drainage services of Seattle Public Utilities; amending Seattle Municipal Code Section 21.33.030 to adjust drainage rates, and provide a reduction for certain commercial buildings that utilize rainwater harvesting systems; and amending Seattle Municipal Code Section 21.76.040 to adjust credits to low- income drainage customers.

 WHEREAS, the rates for drainage services were last increased on January 1, 2003; and,

 WHEREAS, the installation of additional drainage facilities has resulted in increased annual expenses for debt service and operations; and

 WHEREAS, Seattle Public Utilities ("SPU") anticipates, and the Council recognizes, that a significant bond issuance will be needed during 2004 to finance a portion of the drainage Capital Improvement Program ("CIP") and that this issuance will further increase annual wastewater expenses for debt service; and

 WHEREAS, a reexamination of costs shared by the drainage, wastewater, water, and solid waste

 components of SPU has resulted in an increase in costs allocated to drainage ratepayers; and

 WHEREAS, the State Legislature passed, and the Governor signed, House Bill 2088, which requires drainage, stormwater, or surface water rates be reduced by a minimum of 10% for any new or remodeled commercial building that uses a permissive rainwater harvesting system; and

 WHEREAS, SPU has completed a rate study showing that existing rates will not provide sufficient revenues to pay the costs of providing drainage services and that rate increases therefore are required; and

 WHEREAS, the City Council has reviewed SPU's study and proposed rate increases, and the City Council has determined that somewhat lower rate increases are needed to produce revenues that, barring unforeseen factors that significantly increase costs or decrease revenues, will enable (a) the SPU drainage line of business to cash-finance at least 11.6% of its 2004 CIP, while achieving year-end cash balances of at least $3 million, and (b) the overall SPU Drainage and Wastewater Fund to cash-finance at least 11.5% of its 2004 CIP, while achieving year- end cash balances of at least $7 million;

 WHEREAS, credits for qualified low-income customers need to be revised to reflect the increase in drainage rates; NOW, THEREFORE,

 BE IT ORDAINED BY THE CITY OF SEATTLE AS FOLLOWS:

 Section 1. Subsection D of Seattle Municipal Code Section 21.33.030 is amended as follows:

 SMC 21.33.030 Drainage service charges -- Schedule -- Exemptions.

 *****

 D. The rate categories and the corresponding annual drainage service charges are as follows:

~~Effective~~ Effective Effective~~Jan. 1, 2001~~ Jan. 1, 2003 Jan. 1, 2004

 Single-family ~~$99.00~~ $104.94 $110.36 Residential ~~per parcel~~ per parcel per parcel

 5. (86 -- 100%) ~~775.23 per acre~~ 821.74 per acre 944.43 per acre

SPU shall provide a 10% reduction in drainage rates for properties containing new or remodeled commercial buildings that, after July 27, 2003, install and utilize rainwater harvesting systems that are sized to use or infiltrate the amount of rain that falls on the roofs of such buildings during a one year, 24 hour storm event. A system that involves indoor uses of rainwater must be permitted by Seattle-King County Department of Health in order to qualify for the rate reduction. A system that relies solely on the capture and indoor use of rainwater shall qualify for the drainage rate reduction only if the system is sized to meet the performance requirement. Qualifying for the drainage rate reduction does not relieve the property owner from the obligation to comply with applicable stormwater and drainage code requirements for the buildings and site.
