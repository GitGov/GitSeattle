 WHEREAS, RCW Chapter 35.72 authorizes agreements between cities and developers that provide for partial reimbursement of the costs of such street improvements to be made to the developer by other benefited properties under certain circumstances; and

 WHEREAS, pursuant to RCW Chapter 35.72, the City formulated a preliminary assessment reimbursement area to include the parcels of real property adjacent to the street improvements and a preliminary determination of the reimbursement share applicable to each such parcel, and, by certified mail, sent the preliminary determination of the area boundaries and assessments to the property owners of record within the proposed assessment area along with the information that such property owners had the right to request in writing a public hearing before the City Council within 20 days of the mailing; and
