 AN ORDINANCE revising the 2002 annual budget by appropriating unanticipated revenues associated with the interest payments accruing to the City from certain disputed business and occupation tax obligations and increasing the expenditure allowance in the 2002 budget of the Legislative Department, by a three-fourths vote of the City Council.

 WHEREAS, the City of Seattle has recently secured payment of more than $2.5 million in previously disputed business and occupation taxes, including approximately $1.0 million in accumulated interest, and deposited these revenues in the General Subfund; and

 WHEREAS, the City Council established an emergency preparedness and public safety initiative as part of the 2002 budget review process; and

 WHEREAS, the City Council has determined that a fully independent audit of Seattle City Light's financial position, including an assessment of its current cumulative debt and on-going risk management strategies, is needed to ensure the long-run financial health of the Utility and to protect ratepayers' interests; and

 WHEREAS, the Pioneer Square Community Association took a leadership role in planning for this year's Mardi Gras and Founders' Fest, including planning for enhanced public safety measures; and

 WHEREAS, additional resources will be needed for the Legislative Department to fully support these initiatives and efforts; NOW THEREFORE,

 BE IT ORDAINED BY THE CITY OF SEATTLE AS FOLLOWS:

 Section 1. In order to pay for necessary costs and expenses to be incurred in 2002, but for which insufficient appropriations were made, the expenditure allowance for the Legislative Department is increased by four hundred thousand dollars ($400,000) as follows:

 Fund Line of Business Amount General Subfund (00100) Legislative Department (G1100) $400,000

 Section 2. In accordance with RCW 35.32A.060, by reason of the facts above stated, the foregoing appropriation is made to meet actual necessary expenditures of the City for which insufficient appropriations have been made due to causes that could not reasonably have been foreseen at the time of the making of the 2002 Budget.

 Section 3. Council intends that this additional appropriation will be allocated as follows:

 A) Approximately one hundred fifty thousand dollars ($150,000) of this appropriation will be used to fund a fully independent audit of Seattle City Light. This audit, to be directed and managed by the Office of the City Auditor, will include an overall assessment of the Utilities financial health, including a review of debt management, risk mitigation and resource planning procedures. In addition, the audit will include a comparative analysis of existing and alternative governance models. Once the full cost of this audit has been determined, appropriate funding will be transferred to the Office of the City Auditor.

 B) Approximately one hundred fifty thousand dollars ($150,000) of this appropriation is intended to support Council's Emergency Preparedness Initiative. Council has determined that accelerated assessment of the City's emergency preparedness needs requires support from objective, outside expertise. The participation of outside experts will be structured to support and complement on-going efforts within the City by providing early, independent review of the City's current strengths and vulnerabilities, and recommendations about how to improve planning and accelerate implementation.

 C) As much as fifteen thousand dollars ($15,000) will be available to reimburse the Pioneer Square Community Association for expenses occurred in planning for security at the 2002 Mardi Gras festivities. Council will review detailed documentation of actual incurred expenses before final reimbursement is provided.

 D) Any remaining funds will be reserved for research and/or consultant expenses needed to support Council's oversight role. It is anticipated that any unexpended or uncommitted fund balance resulting from this appropriation will be returned to the General Fund at years end.

 Section 4. This ordinance shall take effect and be in force thirty (30) days from and after its approval by the Mayor, but if not approved and returned by the Mayor within ten (10) days after presentation, it shall take effect as provided by Municipal Code Section 1.04.020.
