 WHEREAS, the purpose of the SR519 Intermodal Access Project (hereinafter the "Project") is to improve intermodal access for freight, ferry users, and pedestrians along State Route 519 between Interstate 90 ("I-90") and the Seattle waterfront by: reducing traffic delay, improving intersections, and separating freight and general purpose traffic; eliminating at-grade railroad crossings for vehicles; and providing grade separated connections between transit facilities and destinations for pedestrians; and

 WHEREAS, the City of Seattle ("City"), Washington State Department of Transportation ("WSDOT"), King County ("County"), the Washington State Major League Baseball Stadium Public Facilities District ("PFD"), the Port of Seattle ("Port"), and Burlington Northern Santa Fe Railway Company ("BNSF"), entered into a Memorandum of Understanding dated March 26, 1997 (the "MOU"), relating to project design and financial contributions for final design work for the Project; and

 WHEREAS, the City Council authorized the City's participation in the Project via Ordinance 118160; and

 WHEREAS, the Project is included in the City's 2000-2005 Transportation Capital Improvement Program; and

 WHEREAS, the City has lead responsibility for SR-519 project-related road improvements to Alaskan Way South, South Royal Brougham Street, Colorado Avenue South and First Avenue South; and

 WHEREAS, SR-519 project-related improvements may include an expanded remote holding area for ferry access/queuing lanes as described by the SR-519 Environmental Re-Evaluation dated April 2004, and may be implemented as the capacity of the current remote holding is exceeded on a consistent basis; and WSDOT has recently completed their part of the project; NOW, THEREFORE,

 BE IT ORDAINED BY THE CITY OF SEATTLE AS FOLLOWS:

 Section 1. Subject to the terms and conditions of this ordinance, permission is hereby granted to the Washington State Department of Transportation ("WSDOT") to construct, maintain and operate a Remote Ferry Operations Area on the eastern portion of Alaskan Way South between South Royal Brougham Way and a point just north of South Dearborn Street as shown on the drawings attached hereto as Exhibit A. The Remote Ferry Operations Area may include uses and structures accessory to the operation of ferries, such as structures for material and equipment storage, ticket machines, restrooms, and vehicular parking; and queuing lanes for ferry traffic. The queuing lanes will be open for use only during peak hours of usage, state and federal holidays, and other times as determined by WSDOT. WSDOT's facilities shall conform to applicable City codes and standards. .

 Section 2. The permission herein granted to WSDOT, it's successors and assigns shall be for a term of thirty (30) years, commencing on the effective date of this ordinance and terminating at 11:59 p.m. on the last day of the thirtieth year, and within one hundred eighty (180) days thereafter, WSDOT shall remove all structures and other appurtenances of the Remote Ferry Operations Area and shall place all portions of the street right-of- way which may have been disturbed by WSDOT's construction or use of the Remote Ferry Operations Area in as good condition in all respects as the abutting portions, unless WSDOT makes written application for and the City Council grants a new ordinance for continued use and maintenance of the Remote Ferry Operations Area .

 Section 3. The permission hereby granted is subject to the City's right to grant permits for the installation of new utilities in the right-of-way, and to the requirement that any protection, support or relocation of existing utilities during construction of the Remote Ferry Operations Area that is deemed necessary by the owner of the utility shall be done as an expense of the City's SR-519 Surface Street Construction Project. In the case of later construction or reconstruction within the Remote Ferry Operations Area Lanes 1 through 4, utility relocation shall be at WSDOT's expense. WSDOT shall be responsible for any damage to the utilities caused by or related to maintenance or operation of the Remote Ferry Operations Area.

 Section 4. The permission granted hereby is subject to primary and secondary use by the public for general travel and utility purposes, and the City expressly reserves the right to require WSDOT to remove all equipment and / or facilities associated with the remote operations area Remote Ferry Operations Area at WSDOT's sole cost for (a) and (b) below in the event that:

 (a) The City Council determines, by ordinance, that the space occupied by the Remote Ferry Operations Area is necessary for any primary or secondary public use or benefit; or

 (b) The Director of Transportation ("Director") determines that any term or condition of this ordinance has been violated, and such violation has not been corrected by WSDOT after written notice of violation has been given by the City and WSDOT has had at least sixty (60) days thereafter to correct the violation.

 A City Council determination that the space is necessary for a primary or secondary public use or benefit shall be conclusive and final. WSDOT shall be entitled to seek review or reconsideration of a determination by the Director that WSDOT has violated a term or condition of this ordinance pursuant to the procedures for reconsideration of a Director's decision as provided in Seattle Municipal Code 15.04.112, or prior to the Director making a final determination of violation, the parties will hereby agree to resolve the dispute through the use of a Dispute Review Board.

 Section 5. In the event that the permit is not renewed, or the permission hereby granted extends to its termination in thirty (30) years, or the City orders removal of the Remote Ferry Operations Area pursuant to the terms of this ordinance, then within ninety (90) days after such expiration, termination or order of removal, or prior to the date stated in an Order to Remove, as the case may be, WSDOT shall remove all structures, access gates and other appurtenances of Remote Ferry Operations Area and shall place all portions of the street that may have been disturbed in as good condition for public use as they were prior to construction, and in at least as good condition in all respects as the abutting portions thereof. The Director shall issue a certificate discharging WSDOT from responsibility under this ordinance for occurrences after the date of such discharge.

 Section 6. WSDOT is authorized, in conformance with applicable City codes and standards, to reconstruct, alter or repair its facilities within the Remote Ferry Operations Area and to modify its operations within the Remote Operations Area to accommodate WSDOT's operational needs or the needs of the public using the Remote Operations Area. WSDOT shall not modify the manner that traffic enters or exits the Remote Operations Facility without prior approval of the Director. The Director in his/her judgment may order such reconstruction, relocation, readjustment or repair of any part of the Remote Ferry Operations Area at WSDOT's own cost and expense because of deterioration or unsafe condition.

 Section 7. After written notice to WSDOT, and failure of WSDOT to correct said unsafe or risk prone condition within the time stated in such notice, the Director may order the Remote Ferry Operations Area closed if the Director deems that it has become unsafe or creates a risk of injury to the public. In a situation in which there is an immediate threat to the health or safety of the public, notice is not required.

 Section 8. Notwithstanding termination or expiration of the permission granted, or closure or removal of the Remote Ferry Operations Area, WSDOT shall remain bound by its obligation under this ordinance until: (a) the Remote Ferry Operations Area and all equipment and property are removed from the street right-of-way; (b) the area is cleared and restored in a manner and to a condition satisfactory to the Director; and (c) the Director certifies that WSDOT has discharged its obligation herein.

Provided that if it is determined by a court of competent jurisdiction that RCW 4.24.115 applies to this ordinance, then in the event claims or damages are caused by or result from the concurrent negligence of:

 (a) The City, its agents, contractors or employees; and,

 (b) The WSDOT, its agents, contractors, employees or its successors or assigns, this indemnity provision shall be valid and enforceable only to the extent of the negligence of WSDOT or WSDOT's agents, contractors, employees or its successors or assigns.

 Section 10. With the exception of the initial construction contract that will be administered by the City of Seattle, WSDOT shall require that any and all of its contractors performing construction, reconstruction, repairs, maintenance or other work on the structures as contemplated by this permit, name the City of Seattle as an additional insured on all policies of public liability insurance, and shall include in all contract documents a provision extending construction indemnities and warranties granted to WSDOT to the City as well.

 Section 11. The WSDOT, its successors and assigns shall not assign or transfer any privileges conferred by this ordinance without the consent of the City Council by resolution. If permission is granted, all terms and conditions of this ordinance shall bind the assignee or transferee.

 Section 12. WSDOT shall pay to the City such amounts as may be chargeable by the City as costs of inspection of the structures and appurtenances of the Remote Ferry Operations Area during its any major reconstruction, repair or maintenance, or at other times under the direction of the Director of Transportation.

 Section 13. WSDOT shall perform routine and special inspections of the sign bridges and their attachments to the Alaskan Way Viaduct. The inspection frequency shall be as determined by the WSDOT Bridge Preservation Office and as necessary to insure the safety of the Remote Ferry Operations Area, but shall not exceed once every two years. A copy of the completed inspection shall be submitted to the Seattle Department of Transportation within thirty (30) days of completion of the inspection.

 Section 14. WSDOT shall be subject to all applicable statutes, rules, regulations and ordinances regarding non- discrimination relating to employment and access in connection with the construction, reconstruction, repair, maintenance or use of the Remote Ferry Operations Area.
