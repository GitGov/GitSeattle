 BE IT ORDAINED BY THE CITY OF SEATTLE AS FOLLOWS:

 Section 1. The Seattle City Council hereby adopts the 2004 Update to the 2001-2004 Consolidated Plan for Housing and Community Development, attached hereto as Attachment 1 ("Adopted 2004 Update"), for the purposes and subject to the conditions, limitations and potential amendments as set forth in this ordinance.

 Section 2. Attachment 1 includes the following portions, which are adopted with the intent and effect as set forth in this section and in sections 3 and 4 below:

 (a) An introductory section entitled "About this Update," which is adopted to describe generally the purposes of the Adopted 2004 Update, subject to the more specific provisions in this ordinance;

 (b) A subsection entitled "Housing Investment Areas and Downtown" in the portion of the Adopted 2004 Update entitled "Housing Policies", which subsection: (1) supersedes in its entirety the section of the Consolidated Plan headed "Special Objective Areas;" (2) describes the City's general intent regarding the priorities and strategies for the use of housing funds in specified geographic areas; (3) describes certain policies and priorities for these areas contained in Neighborhood Plans and other documents; and (4) identifies certain proposals to be considered by the City in these areas ;

 (c) An overview of funding allocations entitled "Allocation of Consolidated Plan Funds," which summarizes generally the distribution of expected 2004 funding from the sources described, but is subject to the more detailed allocations described below and to budget authority;

 (d) Those portions constituting elements of the 2004 Action Plan as required by 24 CFR Section 91.220, which portions are approved in their entirety as the application to HUD for the grant funding for the programs set forth in the recitals above, and which include a table under the heading "Action Plan" setting forth specific funding allocations, subject to expenditure authority in the 2004 Adopted Budget or hereafter granted, which allocations are to be effective upon the approval of the 2004 Action Plan by HUD, and which table shall be and hereby is modified to reflect the changes enumerated on Attachment 3 to this ordinance, which is hereby incorporated by reference and shall supersede, to the extent of any inconsistency, the terms of Attachment 1.

 (e) Marked changes to existing sections of the Consolidated Plan, which changes are adopted effective upon approval of the 2004 Action Plan by HUD;

 (f) The sections of Appendix B of the Consolidated Plan that establish the maximum percentage of federal Community Development Block Grant funds that may be spent for planning and administration activities under existing HUD regulations;

 (g) The sections of Appendix B of the Consolidated Plan regarding Program Income from the single-family program, providing that income from this fund may be reprogrammed to other eligible activities with approval by the Mayor and City Council;

 (h) Other portions of the Adopted 2004 Update, which generally are explanatory in nature or contain information, which may include citizen comments and responses, considered in formulating policies and strategies.

 Previously existing sections of the Plan included in the Adopted 2004 Update in which marked changes are shown, including appendixes, are not readopted in full; rather the unchanged portions are intended to show text that remains in the Plan, and speaks as of the date of the adoption of that text.

 Section 3. With the exceptions of the Citywide Housing Funding Policies, Housing Investment Areas and Downtown, the Community Development Block Grant Planning and Administration cap described in subsection 2(f) above and of the strategies and policies for the use of the funds allocated in the 2004 Action Plan, the descriptions in the 2004 Update of actual or intended strategies or policies of the City, its departments or offices, or other agencies such as the Seattle Housing Authority, are intended to describe or summarize strategies that are adopted, and may be revised or amended, independent of the Plan, and not to modify or supersede existing ordinances or policies, nor to give such strategies or policies any new or additional legal effect. The 2004 Action Plan represents the City's plan, and proposal to HUD, for the use of the funds subject to the 2004 Action Plan, and is to serve the functions set forth in 24 CFR Section 91.1(b), but the contents of the 2004 Action Plan are not otherwise intended to have legal effect.

 Section 4. The allocations set forth in the Adopted 2004 Update do not constitute appropriations or modify the amounts of any existing appropriations, nor are they to be considered as final funding decisions. The authority of the respective City departments and offices to implement the activities set forth in the Adopted 2004 Update is subject to sufficient appropriations in the 2004 Adopted Budget or in any separate ordinance. Implementation of any specific project or program is also subject to a final determination by the appropriate office or department after completion of any necessary review under environmental and related laws. No part of the Adopted 2004 Update or the Plan is intended to confer any legal rights or entitlements on any persons, groups or entities.

 Section 5. The Mayor and the Director of Human Services ("the Director") and their designees are hereby authorized to submit the Adopted 2004 Update to the 2001-2004 Consolidated Plan for Housing and Community Development, together with any necessary supplementary material, to the United States Department of Housing and Urban Development ("HUD") as the application by the City for financial assistance under certain HUD programs; to represent the City in seeking HUD approval of the Adopted 2004 Update, to make and submit to HUD such modifications to the Adopted 2004 Update or the Plan as HUD may require, provided that no substantial policy changes are involved; and to sign and deliver on behalf of the City such assurances and certifications as may be necessary to obtain HUD approval. The Director is further authorized to make such technical and conforming changes to the Plan as she may deem reasonably necessary, and to amend the Plan, if necessary or appropriate under federal regulations, to reflect funding of specific activities, final appropriations for the programs or lines of business in the Adopted Budget, or changes in activities that are consistent with the policies and priorities established in the Plan. The Director shall notify the City Council of all changes or amendments to the Plan. Any substantial amendment as defined by the adopted Citizen Participation Plan for the Consolidated Plan, as attached as Appendix C to Attachment 1 to Ordinance 121083, shall be approved by the Council by ordinance or resolution.

 Section 6. The amendments to the 2003-2004 Administrative and Financial Plan of the 2002 Housing Levy shown in Attachment 2 is hereby adopted.

 Section 7. Any action pursuant to the authority and prior to the effective date of this ordinance is hereby ratified and confirmed.
