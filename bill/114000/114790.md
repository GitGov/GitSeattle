 AN ORDINANCE relating to the Hearing Examiner, amending Section 3.02.110 and 3.92.010 of the Seattle Municipal Code to modify the process for appointing the Hearing Examiner and designating persons to act as Hearing Examiner.

 WHEREAS, the current process for appointment of the Hearing Examiner calls for a committee that includes a person serving in a King County office that no longer exists; and

 WHEREAS, Subsection 3.92.010A of the Seattle Municipal Code applies to determine who will act as Hearing Examiner when a vacancy in that office occurs, but is inconsistent with the appointment process for that office; and

The Civil Service Commission having filed as a permanent record in the Office of the City Comptroller its recommendation that the Office of Hearing Examiner, as a professional or administrative office or position similar to offices and positions designated in Article XVI, Section 11 of the City Charter, and should not be included in the classified civil service, such office shall not be included in the classified civil service. Each Hearing Examiner shall be appointed to an initial term of one (1) year, and may thereafter be reappointed to subsequent four (4) year terms, subject to removal for cause by the City Council.

C. Upon the occurrence of a vacancy in the position of Hearing Examiner, the senior Deputy Hearing Examiner in the Office of Hearing Examiner shall perform, in addition to his/her regular duties, the duties of the Hearing Examiner unless the President of the City Council and the Chair of the committee responsible for land use legislation concur, and indicate their concurrence in writing filed with the City Clerk, that the interests of the City would be better served by the designation of another person to serve as acting Hearing Examiner until such time as a Hearing Examiner is appointed through the process set forth in subsection B of this section.

D. The Hearing Examiner's performance as a department head may be reviewed annually through a process developed by the Council President or his/her designee for this process, or at a minimum, prior to consideration of reappointment.

~~C~~E. The Hearing Examiner is authorized from time to time to appoint Hearing Examiners Pro Tempore to serve on a day-to-day basis during the absence, unavailability, incapacity or disqualification of the Hearing Examiner.

~~D~~F. There is created in the Office of Hearing Examiner the position of Deputy Hearing Examiner. The Civil Service Commission having filed as a permanent record in the Office of the City Comptroller its recommendation that the position of Deputy Hearing Examiner is a professional or administrative office or position similar to offices and positions designated in Article XVI, Section 11 of the City Charter, and should not be included in the classified civil service, such position shall not be included in the classified civil service. Each Deputy Hearing Examiner shall be appointed by the Hearing Examiner, and perform such duties as shall be required by the Hearing Examiner, and may be removed at will by the Hearing Examiner.

~~E~~G.
