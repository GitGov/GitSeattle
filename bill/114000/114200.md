 ORDINANCE __________________

 AN ORDINANCE granting Wallysons Inc. permission to maintain and operate a pedestrian skybridge over and across the 3rd/4th Avenue Alley, north of Spring Street, for a ten (10) year term, renewable for two successive ten-year terms; specifying the conditions under which this permit is granted; and, providing for acceptance of the permit and conditions.

 WHEREAS, Ordinance 100227, granted permission to the Northern Life Insurance Company to construct, maintain, and operate a pedestrian skybridge over and across the 3rd/4th Avenue Alley, north of Spring Street for a period of ten years beginning September 1, 1971 and ending at 12 o'clock midnight August 31, 1981, with the provision therein that the City Council could renew said permission for successive ten-year periods not to exceed a total of thirty (30) years (expiring August 31, 2001); and

 WHEREAS, Resolution 28571 was passed on August 10, 1992, transferring said permission from Northern Life Insurance Company to Wallysons, Inc; and

 WHEREAS, Resolutions 26610 and 28469 renewed said permission until August 31, 2001; and

 WHEREAS, Wallysons, Inc. desires to continue to maintain and operate said skybridge over and across the 3rd/4th Avenue Alley;

 NOW THEREFORE,

 BE IT ORDAINED BY THE CITY OF SEATTLE AS FOLLOWS:

 Section 1. Subject to the terms and conditions of this ordinance, permission is hereby granted to Wallysons Inc. its successors and assigns ("Permittee") to maintain and operate a pedestrian skybridge over and across the 3rd/4th Avenue Alley, north of Spring Street. The pedestrian skybridge connects the Abraham Lincoln Building at 1110 Third Avenue to the plaza of the Monaco Hotel at the northwest corner of the intersection of Spring Street and 4th Avenue.

 Section 2. The permission herein granted to the Permittee its successors and assigns shall be for a term of ten (10) years commencing on September 1, 2001, and terminating at 11:59 p.m. on August 31, 2011; provided, however, that upon written application of the Permittee at least thirty (30) days before expiration of the term, the City Council may, by resolution, renew the permit for two (2) successive ten (10) year terms, provided further that the total term of the permission as originally granted and thus extended shall not exceed thirty (30) years, subject to the right of The City of Seattle ("City)" by ordinance to then revise any of the terms and conditions contained herein.

 Section 3. The permission is hereby subject to any protection, support, or relocation of existing utilities deemed necessary by the owner of the utility and shall be done at Permittee's expense with the Permittee being responsible for any subsequent damage to the utilities due to construction of the pedestrian skybridge.

 Section 4. The permit granted hereby is subject to primary and secondary use by the public of the alley right-of-way for travel and utility purposes, and the City expressly reserves the right to require the Permittee to remove the pedestrian skybridge at Permittee's sole cost and expense in the event that:

 a) The City Council determines, by ordinance, that the space occupied by the pedestrian skybridge is necessary for any primary or secondary public use or benefit, or that the pedestrian skybridge interferes with any primary or secondary public use or benefit; or

 b) The Director of Seattle Transportation ("Director") determines that any term or condition of this ordinance has been violated, and such violation is not been corrected by the Permittee after notice of violation has been given by the City.

 A City Council determination that the space is necessary for a primary or secondary public use or benefit shall be conclusive and final.

 Section 5. In the event that the permission hereby granted extends to its termination in thirty (30) years, or the City orders removal of the pedestrian skybridge pursuant to the terms of this ordinance, then within ninety (90) days after such expiration, termination, or order of removal, or prior to the date stated in an "Order to Remove," as the case may be, the Permittee shall remove the pedestrian skybridge and shall place all portions of the alley that may have been disturbed for any part of the skybridge, in as good condition for public use as it was prior to construction of the skybridge, and in at least as good condition in all respects as the abutting portions thereof. Whereupon, the Director shall issue a certificate discharging the Permittee from responsibility under this ordinance for occurrences after the date of such discharge.

 Section 6. The Permittee shall not commence reconstruction, relocation, readjustment, or repair of the pedestrian skybridge except under the supervision of, and in strict accordance with, plans and specifications approved by the Director. The Director in his/her judgment may order such reconstruction, relocation, readjustment, or repair of the pedestrian skybridge at the Permittee's own cost and expense because of the deterioration or unsafe condition of the skybridge, grade separations, or the installation, construction, reconstruction, maintenance, operation, or repair of any and all municipally owned public utilities, or for any other cause.

 Section 7. After notice to the Permittee, and failure of the Permittee to correct said unsafe or risk prone condition within the time stated in such notice, the Director may order the pedestrian skybridge closed if the Director deems that it has become unsafe or creates a risk of injury to the public. In a situation in which there is an immediate threat to the health or safety of the public, notice is not required.

 Section 8. Notwithstanding termination or expiration of the permission granted, or closure or removal of the pedestrian skybridge, the Permittee shall remain bound by its obligation under this ordinance until:

 a) the pedestrian skybridge and all its equipment and property are removed from the alley;

 b) the area is cleared and restored in a manner and to a condition satisfactory to the Director; and

 c) the Director certifies that the Permittee has discharged its obligation herein.

 Provided, that upon prior notice to the Permittee and entry of written findings that such is in the public interest, the Director may, in his/her sole discretion, excuse the Permittee, conditionally or absolutely, from compliance with all or any of the Permittee's obligations to remove the pedestrian skybridge and its property, and restore disturbed areas.

 Section 9. The pedestrian skybridge shall remain the exclusive responsibility of the Permittee. The Permittee, by acceptance of this ordinance and the permission hereby granted, does release the City from any and all claims resulting from damage or loss to its own property and does covenant and agree for itself, its successors, and assigns, with The City of Seattle, to at all times protect and save harmless The City of Seattle from all claims, actions, suits, liability, loss, costs, expenses, or damages of every kind and description (excepting only such damages that may result from the negligence of the City), which may accrue to, or be suffered by, any person or persons and/or property or properties, including without limitation, damage or injury to the Permittee, its officers, agents, employees, contractors, invitees, tenants and tenants' invitees, licensees or its successors and assigns, by reason of the maintenance, operation, or use of said pedestrian skybridge, or any portion thereof, or by reason of anything that has been done, or may at any time be done, by the Permittee, its successors or assigns, by reason of this ordinance, or by reason of the Permittee, its successors or assigns, failing or refusing to strictly comply with each and every provision of this ordinance; and if any such suit, action, or claim be filed, instituted, or begun against the City, the Permittee, its successors, or assigns, shall, upon notice thereof from the City, defend the same at its or their sole cost and expense, and in case judgment shall be rendered against the City in any suit or action, the Permittee, its successors, or assigns, shall fully satisfy said judgment within ninety (90) days after such action or suit shall have been finally determined, if determined adversely to the City. Provided that if it is determined by a court of competent jurisdiction that RCW 4.24.115 applies to this ordinance, then in the event claims or damages are caused by or result from the concurrent negligence of:

 a) the City, its agents, contractors, or employees; and,

 b) the Permittee, its agents, contractors, employees, or its successors or assigns, this indemnity provision shall be valid and enforceable only to the extent of the negligence of the Permittee or the Permittee's agents, contractors, employees, or its successors or assigns.

 Section 10. For as long as the Permittee, its successors and assigns, shall exercise any permission granted by this ordinance and until the pedestrian skybridge is entirely removed from its location as described in Section 1 or until discharged by order of the Director as provided in Section 5 of this ordinance, the Permittee shall obtain and maintain in full force and effect, at its own expense, insurance policies which fully protect the City from any and all claims and risks of any loss from perils which can be insured against under general liability insurance contracts and fire insurance contracts, including any extended coverage endorsements thereto which are customarily available from time to time, in conjunction with:

 a) construction, reconstruction, operation, maintenance, use, or existence of the pedestrian skybridge permitted by this ordinance and of any and all portions of the pedestrian skybridge;

 b) Permittee's activity upon or the use or occupation of the area described in Section 1 of this ordinance, as well as;

 c) any and all claims and risks in connection with and activity performed by the Permittee by virtue of the permission granted by this ordinance.

 Minimum insurance requirements shall be a policy of comprehensive commercial general liability of a form acceptable to the City. The City will require insurance coverage to be placed with a company admitted and licensed to conduct business in Washington State, except that if it is infeasible to obtain such a policy, the City may approve an alternative company. Minimum policy limits shall be $2,000,000 per occurrence and $4,000,000 annual aggregate each period. Coverage shall specifically name the pedestrian skybridge exposure. Liability coverage shall add by endorsement the City of Seattle, its elected and appointed officers, officials, employees, and agents as additional insured. Coverage shall contain a Separation of Insureds clause indicating essentially that "except with respect to the limits of insurance, and any rights or duties specifically assigned in this coverage part of the first named insured, this insurance applies as if each named insured were the only named insured, and separately to each insured against whom claim is made or suit is brought." The City will not accept a certificate of insurance as evidence of current coverage.

 Evidence of current coverage shall be submitted to the City in the form of a photocopy of the insurance policy declaration page, indicating all endorsements attached thereto, and is a

 condition to the validity of this permit.

 Whenever in the judgment of the Risk Manager of the City of Seattle, such insurance filed pursuant to the provisions hereof shall be deemed insufficient to fully protect the City of Seattle, the Permittee shall, upon demand by the Risk Manager, furnish additional insurance in such amount as may be specified by the Risk Manager.

 Section 11. The Permittee shall require that any and all of its contractors performing construction work on the premises as contemplated by this permit, name the City of Seattle as an additional insured on all policies of public liability insurance, and shall include in all contract documents a provision extending construction indemnities and warranties granted to Permittee to the City as well.

 Section 12. Within sixty (60) days after the effective date of this ordinance the Permittee shall deliver to the Director of Seattle Transportation for filing with the City Clerk a good and sufficient bond in the sum of Ten Thousand Dollars ($10,000.00), executed by a surety company authorized and qualified to do business in the State of Washington, conditioned that the Permittee will comply with each and every provision of this ordinance and with each and every order of the Director pursuant thereto; provided, that if the Mayor of the City of Seattle in his/her judgment shall deem any bond or bonds filed to be insufficient and demand a new or additional bond, the Permittee shall furnish a new or additional bond in such amount as the Mayor may specify to be necessary to fully protect the City. Said bond shall remain in effect until such time as the pedestrian skybridge is entirely removed from its location as described in Section 1, or until discharged by order of the Director as provided in Section 5 of this ordinance.

 Section 13. The Permittee, its successors, and assigns shall not assign or transfer any privileges conferred by this ordinance without the consent of the City Council by resolution. Notwithstanding anything contained herein to the contrary, consent of the City Council shall not be required for any transfer or assignment of the privileges conferred by this ordinance by way of mortgage, pledge, or encumbrance or by way of foreclosure or deed in lieu of foreclosure of any mortgage, pledge, or encumbrance. If permission is granted, the assignee or transferee shall be bound by all terms and conditions of this ordinance.

 Section 14. The Permittee, its successors and assigns, shall pay to The City of Seattle such amounts as may be justly chargeable by said City as costs of inspection of said pedestrian skybridge during construction, reconstruction, repair, annual structural inspections, and at other times deemed necessary to ensure the safety of the skybridge, under the direction of the Director of Seattle Transportation, as provided by Municipal Code Section 15.76. Permittee shall also promptly pay to the City in advance upon statements rendered by the Director an annual fee for the privileges granted and exercised hereunder of One Thousand Six Hundred Seventy- one Dollars ($1,671.00) for each of the first five years of the permit. The fee will then be evaluated by the City and a new fee will be established by resolution of the City Council for each succeeding five years of the permit. All payments shall be made to the City Finance Director for credit to the General Fund.

 Section 15. The Permittee shall not discriminate against any (1) employee, (2) applicant for employment, or (3) person with respect to the award or referral of a contract or with respect to the conditions, terms, price, or performance standards, or other provisions of a contract in connection with the design, architectural, or structural engineering work or the construction, repair, or maintenance of the pedestrian skybridge permitted to be erected and/or operated pursuant to this ordinance, on the basis of race, religion, creed, color, sex, marital status, sexual orientation, gender identity, political ideology, ancestry, age, national origin, or the presence of any sensory, mental, or physical handicap unless based upon bona fide occupational qualification.

 a) The Permittee shall post in conspicuous places available to such employees and applicants for such employment, notices setting forth the provisions of this non- discrimination clause.

 b) The Permittee shall insert in any contract for work undertaken in connection with the design, architectural, or structural engineering work or the repair, construction, maintenance, or operation of the pedestrian skybridge referenced in this ordinance language substantially similar to the language contained in this Section 15 and which requires any person or entity entering into such contract to comply with the non-discrimination provisions of this Section.

 Section 16. The Permittee shall deliver its written acceptance of the permission conferred by this ordinance and its terms and conditions to the Director of Seattle Transportation within sixty (60) days after the effective date of this ordinance. The acceptance shall be filed with the City Clerk. If no such acceptance is received by then, the privileges provided by this ordinance shall be deemed declined or abandoned; and the permission extended, contingent upon its acceptance, deemed lapsed and forfeited.

 Section 17. This ordinance shall take effect and be in force thirty (30) days from and after its approval by the Mayor, but if not approved and returned by the Mayor within ten (10) days after presentation, it shall take effect as provided by Municipal Code Section 1.04.020.
