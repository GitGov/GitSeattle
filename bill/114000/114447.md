 ASSIGNMENT AGREEMENT

 Between

 The Climate Trust and The City of Seattle

 For Assignment of Carbon Dioxide Offsets from

 The Climate Trust and CERF/IIEC Carbon Dioxide Offset Purchase Agreement

 This Assignment Agreement ("Agreement") is entered into as of __________, ____, ("Effective Date") between The Climate Trust, an Oregon non-profit corporation ("The Climate Trust"), and the City of Seattle, a Washington municipal corporation, through its City Light Department ("Seattle")(collectively, the "Parties").

 RECITALS

 A. The Climate Trust is an Oregon nonprofit corporation and a "qualified organization" as described in ORS 469.503(2)(e)(K) and is exempt from federal taxation under Section 501(c)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code, as amended.

 B. The City Light Department operates a Seattle-owned public power electric utility governed by Seattle's Mayor and City Council.

 C. The CERF/IIEC is a nonprofit corporation registered in the State of New York and is exempt from federal taxation under Section 501(c)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code, as amended. The mission of CERF/IIEC is focused on constructing an efficient and renewable future. In collaboration with the construction, engineering, and environmental industries, CERF/IIEC promotes and facilitates the advancement of innovation for a sustainable infrastructure. CERF/IIEC strives to bring about market transformation and move institutions toward a sustainable future through training and technical assistance.

 D. On April 27, 2001, The Climate Trust and Seattle entered into the "Greenhouse Gas Offset Acquisition Services Agreement" ("Services Agreement") to help implement Seattle's goal of meeting its increased energy demands with no net greenhouse gas emissions, including a commitment to mitigate the greenhouse gases emitted pursuant to its power purchases from the Klamath Falls Cogeneration Project. A copy of the Services Agreement is attached as Exhibit A to this Agreement.

 E. Pursuant to the Services Agreement and its three-phase solicitation process, The Climate Trust and Seattle have selected two carbon dioxide mitigation programs that meet the Seattle requirements and from which The Climate Trust will Assign and transfer to Seattle Carbon Dioxide Offsets. One of those projects, the "Carbon Dioxide Offset Purchase Agreement Between The Climate Trust and CERF/IIEC Regarding The Climate Trust - CERF/IIEC Blended Cement Concrete Program," ("Offset Agreement") is the subject of this Agreement. The other program will be the subject of a separate agreement. A copy of the Offset Agreement is attached to this Agreement as Exhibit B.`

 F. The Offset Agreement implements a program ("Program") to help transform the market for the use of Pozzolans as a partial substitute for Portland cement in concrete mixes ("Blended Cement Concrete") in construction and civil works projects. This Program is designed to encourage and verify the use of Blended Cement Concrete by building confidence in its use through education, information and communication strategies. The Program will involve collaboration of public and private entities such as transportation agencies, cement manufacturers, cement product manufacturers, suppliers of Pozzolans, ready mix concrete companies and public and private project design and construction entities.

 G. During the manufacturing of Portland Cement, greenhouse gases are generated and released through two events: fossil fuel burning by the cement kiln to make clinker; and the calcination process of cement clinker production. For every ton of Portland Cement produced, approximately one ton of carbon dioxide is released into the atmosphere. The fossil fuel burning accounts for approximately 50% to 60% of the carbon dioxide released while the calcination process in clinker production accounts for the other 50% to 40%. The use of blended cements in concretes reduces the amount of Portland Cement used in construction, and in turn, also reduces the amount of carbon dioxide that would otherwise be released into the atmosphere with the use of standard, unblended cement in concretes.

 H. The Program is expected to meet all of the criteria set forth in the January 30, 2001 Request for Proposals ("RFP") issued jointly by The Climate Trust and Seattle, including but not limited to strong credibility, low-cost and "additionality," that is but for the Parties' financing the project would not have happened. Independent reviews of the project helped ensure that this project met the RFP criteria.

 NOW THEREFORE, in consideration of the mutual covenants contained in this Agreement, and other good and valuable consideration, the sufficiency of which is hereby mutually acknowledged, the Parties agree as follows:

 9.3 The Parties shall also attempt to establish a budget for the cost of implementing the Breach Action Plan, including the additional management time and effort required by The Climate Trust to manage the Breach Action Plan ("Breach Action Plan Budget"). The financial responsibility for the Breach Action Plan Budget shall be allocated as follows: 85% for The Climate Trust and 15% for Seattle, unless the Parties agree on a different allocation. Each Party shall bear its own costs incurred in the process of preparing and agreeing to a Breach Action Plan and a Breach Action Plan Budget.

 9.4 If the Parties agree on a Breach Action Plan and a Breach Action Plan Budget, then the Parties shall share any remedies or other benefits that accrue from those according to the following: 85% for The Climate Trust and 15% for Seattle, unless the Parties agree on a different allocation.

 9.5 If Seattle and The Climate Trust cannot agree upon a Breach Action Plan and/or a Breach Action Plan Budget then Seattle shall opt out of the Breach Action Plan and Budget. The Climate Trust may then take whatever actions it decides are best to address the actual or anticipated breach. In such an event, all remedies and other benefits, or liabilities including costs related to liabilities, from such actions by The Climate Trust shall accrue solely to the Climate Trust, including but not limited to any and all Carbon Dioxide Offsets that resulted from The Climate Trust's actions to address the breach.

 9.5.1 In such an event, however, Seattle shall retain ownership to all Carbon Dioxide Offsets previously transferred to Seattle by The Climate Trust and shall retain its rights to the Assignment of such other Carbon Dioxide Offsets, if any, from the Program that may be separated from the Program affected by the breach or anticipated breach and/or are not the result of The Climate Trust's action to address the actual or anticipated breach.

 SECTION 10 - CESSATION OF THE CLIMATE TRUST

 10.1 If it becomes apparent that The Climate Trust will cease to exist or operate and it is expected to be succeeded by another organization during the Term of this Agreement, subject to any applicable bankruptcy or insolvency laws, then The Climate Trust shall ensure that Seattle's rights under this Agreement are not prejudiced.

 10.2 If it becomes apparent that The Climate Trust will cease to exist or operate and it is not expected to be succeeded by another organization during the Term of this Agreement, subject to any applicable bankruptcy or insolvency laws, then The Climate Trust shall take all reasonably necessary steps, before The Climate Trust ceases to exist, to ensure that Seattle's rights are protected.

 SECTION 11 - SUCCESS FEE

 11.1 In accordance with the Services Agreement, Seattle shall pay The Climate Trust a Success Fee for its successful procurement, negotiation and execution of the Offset Agreement. Eligible Offsets and Eligible Contracts means contracts and offsets resulting from the joint solicitation and managed under the Service Agreement. This Success Fee shall be paid in two parts as follows:

 11.1.1 Per Ton Fee: Seattle shall pay The Climate Trust the amount of $11,550 ($0.22 per ton X 52,500 tons). This amount shall be paid in full within thirty (30) days upon receipt of an invoice from The Climate Trust.

 11.1.2 Price Incentive: The purpose of this element of the Success Fee is to reward The Climate Trust for securing offsets for Seattle from the Offset Agreement with a cost of $1.95 per ton, which is below the benchmark average cost of $3.00 per ton for all Eligible Offsets for Seattle under the Services Agreement. Pursuant to the Services Agreement, the Price Incentive shall be calculated as follows:

 11.1.2.1 The total number of offset tons for all Eligible Contracts (the 52,500 tons from this Agreement plus any other Eligible Contracts), as defined in the Services Agreement, shall be added.

 11.1.2.2 The total offset acquisition costs for all Eligible Contracts (the $102,375.00 from this Agreement plus the acquisition costs of tons from any other Eligible Contracts) shall be added.

 11.1.2.3 The total offset acquisition costs will be divided by total number of offset tons for all Eligible Contracts to establish an average cost per ton.

 11.1.2.4 If the average cost per ton is $3.00 or more, then no Price Incentive shall apply.

 11.1.2.5 If the average cost per ton is less than $3.00, then the difference between the average cost per ton (in dollars) and $3.00 will be multiplied by the total number of Eligible Tons contracted for by Seattle. The Price Incentive for The Climate Trust will be 10% of this amount.

 11.1.2.6 Seattle shall pay this Price Incentive, if any as determined by the above calculation, to the Climate Trust not later than the earlier of (a) thirty (30) days after Seattle executes the last offset contract or offset contract assignment agreement for which the Price Incentive is applicable or (b) June 1, 2003.

 11.1.2.7 No Per Ton Fee or Price Incentive shall be paid for any additional Carbon Dioxide Offset under Section 3 of this Agreement (beyond the 52,500 tons for Seattle) and as described in Section 11 of the Offset Agreement.

 SECTION 12 -AMENDMENT OF THE OFFSET AGREEMENT
