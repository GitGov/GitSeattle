 AN ORDINANCE relating to the Seattle Chinatown-International District Preservation and Development Authority's International District Village Square Project; authorizing the City to execute two separate guaranty agreements guaranteeing tax exempt bonds to be issued by the Authority for the support of the International District Village Square Two Project ("IDVSII Project"); establishing the terms and conditions under which the City will provide each such guaranty; and authorizing guaranty agreements, depository agreements, a reconveyance to the Authority of the City's interest in the real property which was the City's security for the City's guaranty of the Village Square One Bond Issue or a subordination agreement relating thereto, and such related documents and agreements as are necessary between the City, the Authority and other parties with regard to the Authority's issuance of the bonds and the City's guaranties.

 WHEREAS, the Seattle Chinatown-International District Preservation and Development Authority (the "Authority") was chartered by the City pursuant to RCW Ch. 35.21 and Chapter 3.110 of the Seattle Municipal Code to "conserve and renew the unique cultural and ethnic integrity characteristic of the International District" in Seattle; and

 WHEREAS, the Authority has formulated plans to develop land in the International District to be known as the "IDVSII Project" which will include two components: a low-income housing component and a public purpose component consisting of a community center, public library, and parking facilities, the development cost of which is approximately Twenty-four Million Nine Hundred Thirty Eight Thousand Dollars ($24,938,000); and

 WHEREAS, the Authority intends to issue its Special Obligation Bonds, 2002 Series A (Housing Facilities) (the "2002 Series A Bonds") in an amount not to exceed Seven Million Nine Hundred Thousand Dollars ($7,900,000) to finance the low-income housing facilities, and its Special Obligation Bonds, 2002 Series B (Community Facilities) (the "2002 Series B Bonds") in an amount not to exceed Two Million Nine Hundred Thousand Dollars ($2,900,000) to finance the library and parking facilities; and

 WHEREAS, the Authority intends to lend the proceeds of the 2002 Series A Bonds to the IDVS 2 Family Housing LLC (the "Company"), a Washington limited liability company, of which the Authority is the managing member, formed by the Authority for the purpose of developing, constructing and operating the housing facilities component of the IDVSII Project facilities; and

 WHEREAS, the Authority will receive an equity contribution of approximately Four Million Five Hundred Thousand ($4,500,000) from a tax credit investor to finance part of the costs of the housing facilities, and approximately Fourteen Million Dollars ($14,000,000) from sources other than the 2002 Series A Bonds and the 2002 Series B Bonds (collectively, the "Bonds"), including grants, other loans and fundraising proceeds to finance the development cost of the IDVSII Project facilities; and

 WHEREAS, the Authority has requested that the City facilitate the financing of the development cost of the IDVSII Project facilities by guaranteeing repayment of the Bonds in the aggregate principal amount of not to exceed Ten Million Eight Hundred Thousand Dollars ($10,800,000); and

 WHEREAS, the Authority, on its own, would be unable to obtain financing to develop the IDVSII Project facilities on terms that would make it economically and financially feasible, and the City's guaranty of the Bonds would significantly reduce the Authority's borrowing costs and thereby enable the Authority to develop the IDVSII Project facilities in a manner that is financially prudent and that would allow the Authority to provide the greatest benefits to the community in furtherance of its public purpose; and

 WHEREAS, the IDVSII Project will benefit the International District and the City of Seattle as a whole by providing centralized Asian/Pacific resources for low-income housing and community services through a community center, public library, and parking facility; and

 WHEREAS, the Authority forecasts that the rental payments from the low-income housing units and leases of the IDVSII Project facilities, together with parking revenues, the contributions of a tax credit partner, and other revenues of the Authority, will provide sufficient funds for the repayment of the Bonds; and

 WHEREAS, the Council has received the advice of the City's Debt Management Policy Advisory Committee ("the Committee") pursuant to the City's Debt Management Policies as adopted by Resolution, and while acknowledging the advice of the Committee, finds that the substantial public benefit derived from the IDVSII Project outweighs the financial risks associated with the Project;

 NOW THEREFORE,

 BE IT ORDAINED BY THE CITY OF SEATTLE AS FOLLOWS:

 Section 1. Findings. The City Council hereby makes the following findings:

 It is in the best interests of the City and its citizens for the Authority to develop and construct the IDVSII Project. The Authority, on its own, is unable to obtain sufficient financing to develop and construct the IDVSII Project on terms and conditions that make it economically and financially feasible. The pledge by the City of its full faith and credit to guarantee payment of the principal of and interest on the Authority's Bonds in an aggregate amount not to exceed Ten Million Eight Hundred Thousand Dollars ($10,800,000) will significantly reduce the costs of the Authority's financing for the IDVSII Project and thereby enable the Authority to develop the IDVSII Project facilities in a manner that is financially prudent. The Authority expects to derive funds for the repayment of the Bonds from payments from a tax credit investor, from rental payments under the leases of portions of the IDVSII housing units and facilities, from parking revenues, and from other sources available to the Authority.

 The City Council concludes that the most appropriate method of assisting the Authority in furtherance of its public purpose is to pledge the City's full faith and credit to guarantee payment of the principal of and interest on the Bonds issued by the Authority. Such guaranty shall be provided in the manner hereinafter set forth in two separate guaranty agreements, one for the 2002 Series A Bonds and one for the 2002 Series B Bonds, substantially in the forms contained in Exhibit A and Exhibit B hereto with such modifications as the Mayor may deem necessary and appropriate and which are consistent with this Ordinance. The City Council hereby further finds and declares that the City's provision of credit support and any expenditure of public funds to assist in the development of the IDVSII Project are for a public and strictly municipal purpose.

 Section 2. Authorization to execute agreements. If he finds it to be in the best interests of the City to do so, the Mayor is authorized to execute on behalf of the City two guaranty agreements with the Authority substantially in the forms contained in Exhibits A and B hereto. The Mayor's authority to execute either or both guaranty agreements, however, is expressly contingent upon (a) the Authority and a tax credit investor executing a final agreement providing for the contribution of the tax credit investor of approximately Four Million Five Hundred Thousand Dollars ($4,500,000) to the IDVSII Project; and (b) both the Company's and the Authority's obligations under either or both guaranty agreements being secured by a deed of trust or deeds of trust acceptable to the Director of the Department of Finance. The Mayor is further authorized to execute depository agreements and such other related agreements and documents as he deems necessary and appropriate to carry out the agreements contemplated in Exhibits A and B and this Ordinance.

 Section 3. Authorization to reconvey interest in real property or execute subordination agreement. If, to carry out the goals set forth in this Ordinance, he finds it to be in the interests of the City to do so, the Mayor is authorized to execute on behalf of the City a reconveyance deed, reconveying to the Authority the City's interest in the real property securing the City's guaranty of the 1996 Bonds issued by the Authority in support of the Village Square One project, or a subordination agreement subordinating the City's interest in the real property securing the City's guaranty of the 1996 Bonds issued by the Authority in support of the Village Square One project.

 Section 4. This ordinance shall take effect and be in force thirty (30) days from and after its approval by the Mayor, but if not approved and returned by the Mayor within ten (10) days after presentation, it shall take effect as provided by Municipal Code Section 1.04.020.
