 This Agreement is entered into by and between THE CITY OF SEATTLE (hereinafter referred to as "the City"), a municipal corporation of the State of Washington, acting through the City's Director of Fleets & Facilities and the Pike Place Market Preservation and Development Authority (hereinafter referred to as "the Operator"), a public corporation organized pursuant to the laws of the State of Washington, RCW 35.21.660 and 35.21.670 and Ordinance 100495 of The City of Seattle.

 WHEREAS, the City owns right-of-way for roadway commonly known as the Alaskan Way Viaduct, located near Elliott Avenue; and

 WHEREAS, the Operator desires to provide additional controlled public parking in the vicinity of the Pike Place Market on that City-owned right-of-way; and

 WHEREAS, it is deemed to be in the public interest for the City and the Operator to enter into a new Parking Operation/Management Agreement to accomplish said purpose and to continue the parking lot operation/management relationship originally established in a February 4, 1986 Agreement (the "First Agreement") executed by the City pursuant to Seattle Ordinance 112617, as such First Agreement was modified by a July 30, 1986 Pike Place Market Development Authority High Occupancy Vehicle Parking Program Memorandum of Agreement and a December 29, 1988 Amendment; and as subsequently refined in a 1990 Operation/Management Agreement executed by the City pursuant to Seattle Ordinance 115524, as extended by oral agreements of the parties to this date;

 NOW, THEREFORE, the City and Operator agree to the following:

 1. Description of the Property

 All those ground surface level portions of the street right-of-way under the Alaskan Way Viaduct which lie between the south margin of Bell Street and a line 60 feet south of and parallel with the centerline of Lenora Street, as shown on the attached Exhibit 1;

 EXCEPTING therefrom any developed surface street areas within the right-of-way.

 2. Basic Term

 The Initial Term of this Agreement shall commence upon full execution of this Agreement and expire on December 31, 2003; Provided, that unless either party gives notice to the other on or by September 30, 2003, that the party giving such notice does not desire this Agreement to be extended from and after December 31, 2003, this Agreement shall then continue in effect for an additional two (2) years, through December 31, 2005. Thereafter, this Agreement, as amended, shall be automatically renewed for up to six (6) successive six (6)- month periods (i.e., From January 1 through June 30, 2006; then from July 1 through December 31, 2006; etc., up through December 31, 2008) unless either party gives notice to the other that this Agreement is terminated for breach pursuant to Section 8.A or 8.B hereof, as amended by this Renewal and Amendment Agreement, or unless either party gives notice to the other pursuant to Section 8.C hereof, as amended by this Renewal and Amendment Agreement, that this Agreement is terminated.

 3. Permitted Use of the Property

 The Operator's use of the described property shall be limited-to the construction and operation of a public pay-parking lot ("Parking Lot" or "lot"). Consistent with the parties 1986 Memorandum of Agreement, the portion of the lot commonly known as the "Blanchard Parking Lot" shall contain not less than ten (10) nor more than twenty (20) parking spaces designated for high-occupancy vehicles. The Operator shall not impose a charge on either the City or any person certified by the City to be a participant (whether driver or passenger) in the City's high-occupancy vehicle parking program. The City shall have the right to determine the terms and conditions for parking in any of the high- occupancy vehicle parking spaces including but not limited to which high- occupancy vehicle parking program participants shall have the right to use such spaces, for how long any such use may last each day, whether any charge shall be associated with such use, what use shall be made of any revenue derived from such high-occupancy vehicle parking, and when (and if) such specialized use shall be available. If the City determines that some or all of the high- occupancy vehicle parking spaces should be treated like the remaining parking spaces in the lot (and thus be available for use by any person for the then- current charge), the City shall give at least thirty (30) days' prior notice to the Operator of that decision and the effective date on which such treatment shall commence. From and after that date until the effective date of a City decision to have at least ten (10) but no more than twenty (20) parking spaces in such lot made available for use by participants in a City high-occupancy vehicle parking program, the Operator may treat such spaces just like other spaces in the lot. After the termination of the City's high-occupancy vehicle parking program at the lot or the reduction of the number of parking spaces to be used to carry out such program, the City shall give the Operator notice of a City decision that either the number of spaces to be used to carry out such program shall be increased or that such a program shall be re-instituted at the lot, which notice shall be delivered to the Operator at least thirty (30) days prior to the effective date thereof. All such operational changes may be implemented without having to amend this Agreement. The Operator shall operate the lot with its own forces in full compliance with all applicable laws, regulations, and ordinances.
