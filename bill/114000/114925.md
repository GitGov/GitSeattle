 OUT-OF-CLASS STEP INCREASES

 WHEREAS, the Task Force on Service Delivery Efficiencies signed a tentative agreement on December 9, 1994 regarding proposed revisions on work out-of-class to include, when work out of class exceeds twelve (12) continuous months, the employee would receive a step increase in the out-of-class title; and

 WHEREAS, during negotiations for a successor collective bargaining agreement, the City and the Union agreed to the proposed revisions by adding language to Section 4.2.1 of the Agreement; and

 WHEREAS, the added language to Section 4.2.1 did not take into consideration the effect the new language would have on existing language; and

 WHEREAS, over the succeeding years, City departments have administrated Section 4.2.1 with at least six (6) different interpretations; therefore

 This Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) outlines changes to the collective bargaining agreement between the City of Seattle and Joint Crafts Council.

 The changes are shown in bill draft form and only the Section that is impacted is listed. Articles and Sections of the collective bargaining agreement not included in the MOU will not be changed by this MOU.

 The undersigned parties hereby agree to amend Section 4.2.1 of the Joint Crafts Council Agreement for employees currently in out-of-class assignments upon the effective date of the enabling legislation and beyond as follows:

 4.2.1 An employee shall be granted the first automatic step increase in salary rate upon completion of six (6) months of "actual service" when hired at the first step of the salary range, and succeeding automatic step increases shall be granted after twelve (12) months of "actual service" from the date of eligibility for the last step increase to the maximum of the range.

This provision shall not apply to~~work outside of classification or to~~ temporary employees prior to regular appointment, except as otherwise provided for in Section 1.2.10; and except that step increments in the out-of-class title shall be authorized when a step increase in the primary title reduces the pay differential to less than what the promotion rule permits, provided that such increment shall not exceed the top step of the higher salary range.

 WHEREAS, during negotiations for a successor collective bargaining agreement, the City and the Union agreed to the proposed revisions by adding language to Section 7.6 of the Agreement; and

 WHEREAS, the added language to Section 7.6 did not take into consideration the effect the new language would have on existing language; and

 WHEREAS, over the succeeding years, City departments have administrated Section 7.6 with at least six (6) different interpretations; and

 WHEREAS, the Union has filed a Step 3 grievance on behalf of all members in their bargaining units; therefore

 This Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) outlines changes to the collective bargaining agreement between the City of Seattle and International Federation of Professional and Technical Engineers, Local 17, Municipal Court Probation Counselors.

 The changes are shown in bill draft form and only the Section that is impacted is listed. Articles and Sections of the collective bargaining agreement not included in the MOU will not be changed by this MOU.

 The undersigned parties hereby agree to amend Section 7.6 of the International Federation of Professional and Technical Engineers, Local 17, Municipal Court Probation Counselors Agreement for employees currently in out-of-class assignments upon the effective date of the enabling legislation and beyond as follows:

 7.6 A. Every employee upon first appointment shall receive the minimum rate of the salary range fixed for the position, except as provided herein. When the application of this paragraph results in an inequity, or when it becomes necessary because of difficulties in recruitment, payment of other than the prescribed step may be authorized by the Employer.

 B. An employee shall be granted the first automatic step increase in salary rate upon completion of six (6) months of "actual service" when hired at the first step of the salary range, and succeeding automatic step increases shall be granted after twelve (12) months of "actual service" from the date of eligibility for the last step increase to the maximum of the range. Actual service for purposes of this Section shall be defined in terms of one month's service for each month of full-time employment, including paid absences. Step increments in the out-of-class title shall be authorized when a step increase in the primary title reduces the pay differential to less than what the promotion rule permits, provided that such increments shall not exceed the top step of the higher salary range. Further, when an employee is assigned to perform~~the same~~ out-of-class duties in the same title~~on a full-time, continuous basis~~ for twelve (12)~~or more~~ months (each 2088 hours) of actual service, they will receive one step increment in the higher-paid title; provided that they have not received a step increment in the out-of-class title based on changes to the primary pay rate within the previous twelve (12) months and that such increment does not exceed the top step of the higher salary range.

 C. For employees assigned salary steps other than the beginning step of the salary range, subsequent salary increases within the salary range shall be granted after twelve (12) months of "actual service" from the appointment or increase, then at succeeding twelve-month intervals to the maximum of the salary range established for the class.

 D. In determining "actual service" for advancement in salary step, absence due to sickness or injury for which the employee does not receive compensation may, at the discretion of the Employer, be credited at the rate of thirty (30) calendar days per year. Unpaid absences due to other causes may, at the discretion of the Employer, be credited at the rate of fifteen (15) calendar days per year. For the purposes of this paragraph, time lost by reason of disability for which an employee is compensated by Industrial Insurance or ordinance disability provisions shall not be considered absence. An employee who returns after layoff, or who is reduced in rank to a position in the same or another department, may be given credit for such prior service.

 E. Any increase in salary based on service shall become effective upon the first day immediately following completion of the applicable period of service.

 F. Changes in Incumbent Status Transfers - An employee transferred to another position in the same class or having an identical salary range shall continue to be compensated at the same rate of pay until the combined service requirement is fulfilled for a step increase, and shall thereafter receive step increases as provided in Section 6.

 G. Promotions - An employee appointed to a position in a class having a higher maximum salary shall be paid at the nearest step in the higher range that: (1) provides the employee who is not at the top step of his/her current salary range a dollar amount at least equal to the next step increase of the employee's current salary range; or (2) provides the employee who is at the top step of his/her current salary range an increase in pay through placement at the salary step in the new salary range which is closest to a four percent (4%) increase, provided that such increase shall not exceed the maximum step established for the higher paying position; provided further, that this provision shall apply only to appointments of employees from regular full-time positions and shall not apply to temporary assignments providing pay "over regular salary while so assigned."

 1. Hours worked out-of-class shall apply toward salary step placement if the employee is appointed, or his/her position reclassified, to the same title as the out-of-class assignment within twelve (12) months of the end of such assignment.

 H. An employee demoted because of inability to meet established performance standards from a regular full-time or part-time position to a position in a class having a lower salary range shall be paid the salary step in the lower range determined as follows:

 1. If the rate of pay received in the higher class is above the maximum salary for the lower class, the employee shall receive the maximum salary of the lower range.

 2. If the rate of pay received in the higher class is within the salary range for the lower class, the employee shall receive that salary rate for the lower class that, without increase, is nearest to the salary rate to which such employee was entitled in the higher class; provided, that the employee shall receive not less than the minimum salary of the lower range.

 I. An employee reduced because of organizational change or reduction in force from a regular full-time or part-time position to a position in a class having a lower salary range shall be paid the salary rate of the lower range that is nearest to the salary rate to which he/she was entitled in his/her former position without reduction, provided that such salary shall in no event exceed the maximum salary of the lower range. If an employee who has completed twenty-five (25) years of Employer service and who within five (5) years of a reduction in lieu of layoff to a position in a class having a lower salary range, such employee shall receive the salary he/she was receiving prior to such second reduction as an "incumbent" for so long as he/she remains in such position or until the regular salary for the lower class exceeds the "incumbent" rate of pay.

 J. When a position is reclassified by ordinance to a new or different class having a different salary range, the employee occupying the position immediately prior to and at the time of reclassification shall receive the salary rate that shall be determined in the same manner as for a promotion; provided, that if the employee's salary prior to reclassification is higher than the maximum salary of the range for such new or different class, he/she shall continue to receive such higher salary as an "incumbent" for so long as he/she remains in such position or until the regular salary for the classification exceeds the "incumbent" rate of pay.

 EVIDENCE WAREHOUSER UNIT

 and

 COMMUNITY SERVICE OFFICER UNIT

 January 1, 2002 through December 31, 2004

 OUT-OF-CLASS STEP INCREASES

 WHEREAS, the Task Force on Service Delivery Efficiencies signed a tentative agreement on December 9, 1994 regarding proposed revisions on work out-of-class to include, when work out of class exceeds twelve (12) continuous months, the employee would receive a step increase in the out-of-class title; and

 WHEREAS, during negotiations for a successor collective bargaining agreement, the City and the Union agreed to the proposed revisions by adding language to Section 9.5.1 and Section 10.3.1 of the Agreement; and

 WHEREAS, the added language to Section 9.5.1 and Section 10.3.1 did not take into consideration the effect the new language would have on existing language; and

 WHEREAS, over the succeeding years, City departments have administrated Section 9.5.1 and Section 10.3.1 with at least six (6) different interpretations; therefore

 This Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) outlines changes to the collective bargaining agreement between the City of Seattle and Teamsters, Local 117 Evidence Warehouser Unit and Community Service Officer Unit.

 The changes are shown in bill draft form and only the Sections that are impacted are listed. Articles and Sections of the collective bargaining agreement not included in the MOU will not be changed by this MOU.

 The undersigned parties hereby agree to amend Section 9.5.1 and Section 10.3.1 of the Teamsters, Local 117 Evidence Warehouser Unit and Community Service Officer Unit Agreement for employees currently in out-of-class assignments upon the effective date of the enabling legislation and beyond as follows:

 9.5.1 An employee shall be granted the first automatic step increase in salary rate upon completion of six (6) months of "actual service" when hired at the first step of the salary range, and succeeding automatic step increases shall be granted after twelve (12) months of "actual service" from the date of eligibility for the last step increase to the maximum of the range. Actual service for purposes of this Section shall be defined in terms of one month's service for each month of full-time employment, including paid absences. This provision shall not apply to~~work outside of classification or to~~ temporary employees prior to regular appointment, except as otherwise provided for in Section 2.2.10, and except that step increments in the out-of-class title shall be authorized when a step increase in the primary title reduces the pay differential to less than what the promotion rule permits, provided that such increment shall not exceed the top step of the higher salary range. Further, when an employee is assigned to perform ~~the same~~out-of-class duties ~~on a full-time continuous basis~~in the same title for a total of twelve (12)~~or more~~ months (each 2088 hours) of actual service, he/she will receive one-step increment in the higher-paid title; provided that he/she has not received a step increment in the out-of-class title based on changes to the primary pay rate within the previous twelve (12) months, and that such increment does not exceed the top step of the higher salary range. ~~However, an employee who has been reclassified shall be given credit for pay step purposes for the continuous time worked immediately preceding the reclassification for which they were properly paid "work outside of classification pay" as provided for in Section 10.1~~.However, hours worked out-of-class, that were properly paid per Article 10.1 of this Agreement, shall apply toward salary step placement if the employee's position is reclassified to the same title as the out-of-class assignment within twelve (12) months of the end of such assignment.

 10.3.1 When an employee is assigned to perform ~~the same~~ out-of-class duties ~~on a full-time, continuous basis~~in the same title for a total of twelve (12)~~or more~~ months (2088 hours), he/she will receive one step increment in the higher- paid title, provided that he/she has not received a step increment  in the out-of-class title based on changes to the primary pay rate within the previous twelve (12) months, and that such increment does not exceed the top step of the higher salary range.
