 Attachment 1 to DPR Ravenna Creek Ordinance

 Agreement

 Between King County Department of Natural Resources & City of Seattle Department of Parks & Recreation

 Concerning the Daylighting of Ravenna Creek in Ravenna Park

 This Agreement is made and entered into this day of , 2004 by and between the City of Seattle, acting through its Department of Parks and Recreation, hereafter referred to as "City of Seattle" and the King County, acting through its Department of Natural Resources hereafter referred to as "King County".

 WHEREAS, King County has long had a goal to remove flow which was formerly part of Ravenna Creek from the sewage conveyance and treatment system, to end unnecessary treatment of those flows, restore treatment capacity, and eliminate unnecessary operating expenditures; and

 WHEREAS, the City of Seattle and King County agree that removing that flow form the sewer and piping it into Union Bay will generate a new source of fresh water into Lake Washington to benefit salmon; and

 WHEREAS, King County has agreed to make available up to $1.7 million to the City of Seattle for construction of "creek daylighting" within Ravenna Park that would remove part of that flow from the sewage conveyance to King County's Stream Flow Transfer Pipeline; and

 WHEREAS, the parties agree that $200,000 of that funding shall be allocated to arts projects associated with the Project; and

 WHEREAS, the daylighting of Ravenna Creek is identified as a high priority in the University Community Urban Neighborhood Plan; and

 WHEREAS, King County has constructed a Stream Flow Transfer Pipeline solely to carry Ravenna Creek waters from Ravenna Park to Union Bay; and

 WHEREAS, the City of Seattle and King County have agreed that daylighted creek flows will not exceed the flow transfer pipeline design capacity;

 Now, therefore, in consideration of the mutual covenants contained herein, the parties agree as follows:

 I. PROJECT OVERVIEW

 1. Overall Project Scope Description

 The Ravenna Creek Daylighting in Ravenna Park project (the "Project") will restore a portion of Ravenna Creek within Ravenna Park to the surface. This portion of Ravenna Creek is now diverted into a King County trunk sewer pipe within Ravenna Park and flows to King County's West Point treatment plant. King County has constructed a Stream Flow Transfer Pipeline outside of Ravenna Park which will carry the restored creek flow into a storm drain operated by the City of Seattle for ultimate discharge into Lake Washington.

 The funding provided by King County will be used by the City of Seattle for restoring a portion of Ravenna Creek within Ravenna Park and for associated artwork.

 2. Purpose of Agreement

 The purpose of this agreement is to set out the general guidelines that will govern King County in releasing funds for the Project. The funds will be released to the City of Seattle for the design costs and construction of the Project as well as for the ownership, maintenance and operation of King County's recently constructed Stream Flow Transfer Pipeline, designed and constructed solely for the conveyance of the daylighted Ravenna Creek.

 II. PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION

 1. Creek Daylighting Project Design and Permitting

 The City of Seattle has acquired the necessary permits to remove the water flowing into the King County sewer from Ravenna Creek and designed a new creek channel from the current terminus of Ravenna Creek to a box culvert within Ravenna Park. The Project will include construction of an overflow weir at the existing creek terminus, which will re-direct flows in excess of 5cfs to the trunk sewer via existing pipes. The creek will terminate in the existing box culvert at the south end of the park; King County's Stream Flow Transfer Pipeline connects to the downstream end of this same culvert located at NE 54th Street.

 2. Creek Daylighting Schedule

 The City of Seattle has completed design and is ready to begin construction of the Project. Construction is anticipated to take 6 months. Construction work may be suspended over the winter months due to permitting restrictions for work in creek and steep slopes. Construction of the Project could begin as early as Fall, 2004.

 3. Responsibilities of the City of Seattle

 The City of Seattle has completed design and received all permits associated with the Project. The City of Seattle will manage all phases of construction within Ravenna Park, including contract bidding, construction contract management, site inspection and project management, community outreach and public information. The City of Seattle will be responsible for all costs and activities associated with the operation and maintenance of the constructed creek within Ravenna Park with the exception of the County's existing 24th Street diversion structure.

 The City of Seattle, after it has inspected and approved the flow transfer conveyance pipeline constructed by King County will accept ownership, and assume the responsibility for operation and maintenance of the completed Stream Flow Transfer Pipeline constructed by King County under Contract C23133C. Upon completion of the Project, the City of Seattle will accept the flow diverted from King County's trunk sewer into the Stream Flow Transfer Pipeline.

 4. Responsibility of King County Department of Natural Resources

 King County has constructed an 18-inch Stream Flow Transfer Pipeline outside of Ravenna Park. Within Ravenna Park, King County will be responsible for flow modifications to King County's existing 24th Street diversion structure. King County will convey ownership of the Stream Flow Transfer Pipeline to Parks free of all liens and encumbrances, and with a full release of claims from the Stream Flow Transfer Pipeline contractor. King County will assign all contractual rights and warranties it has with respect to the Stream Flow Transfer Pipeline and deliver as-built plans and associated electronic files of the design and construction of said pipeline to the City of Seattle.

 III. PROJECT BUDGET AND FUNDING

 1. Project Budget

 In 2000, King County set aside $1.7 million for construction of Ravenna Creek daylighting and associated artwork, and operation and maintenance of the Stream Flow Transfer Pipeline.

 2. Release of Funds

 After the City of Seattle has accepted ownership of the Stream Flow Transfer Pipeline, King County shall release $1.7 Million with the understanding that costs billed by the pipeline contractor for installation of public art will be reimbursed to King County by the City.

 3 . Amendments to this Agreement

 No modification of this Agreement shall be effective unless in writing and signed by an authorized representative of each of the parties hereto.
