 AN ORDINANCE relating to parking rates; amending Section 11.16.120 of the Seattle Municipal Code and adding a new section to Chapter 11.16 of the Seattle Municipal Code to authorize the Director of Seattle Transportation to establish rates for parking payment devices within limits established by ordinance; setting limits on parking rates at parking payment devices; and rescinding a portion of the parking rate policy adopted by Resolution 28986 and reaffirmed in Resolution 30585.

 WHEREAS, the City's Comprehensive Plan establishes as transportation goals (1) providing enough parking to sustain the economic viability of commercial areas while discouraging commuting by single-occupant vehicle and (2) making the best use of the City's limited street space, seeking balance among competing uses; and

 WHEREAS, the City recognizes the importance of parking meters to provide and manage short-term customer parking for commercial businesses, discourage long-term on-street parking in metered spaces, reduce congestion in travel lanes caused by drivers seeking on-street parking, and encourage turnover in use of parking spaces; and

 WHEREAS, because new parking pay stations will provide more convenient payment options for the public (such as credit cards and debit cards) and will help the City more efficiently manage parking, Seattle Transportation is embarking on a multi-year effort to install pay station technology to replace many single-space parking meters; and

 WHEREAS, the current $1.00 per hour rate for most two-hour single- space parking meters went into effect in 1990 and inflation has been over 50 percent since that time; and

 WHEREAS, the City wishes to change its policies related to parking meter rate-setting that were established by Resolution 28986 and most recently reaffirmed in Resolution 30585; NOW, THEREFORE,

 BE IT ORDAINED BY THE CITY OF SEATTLE AS FOLLOWS:

 Section 1. Subsection C of Seattle Municipal Code Section 11.16.120 is amended as follows:

 11.16.120 Director of Transportation - Authority.

 The Director of Transportation is authorized:

 * * *

 C. To ~~make recommendations to the City Council for~~ establish parking ~~meter~~ rates to be charged at parking payment devices, including parking meters, for parking in city- controlled parking areas under the jurisdiction of Seattle Transportation and other city rights-of-way, consistent with Section 11.16.121,~~within parking meter zones~~ and to make recommendations to the City Council for fees for permits issued pursuant to this subtitle;

 * * *

 Section 2. A new section is added to Chapter 11.16 of the Seattle Municipal Code to read as follows:

 11.16.121 Director of Transportation - Rate Setting for Parking Payment Devices.

 A. Parking rates to be charged at parking payment devices, including parking meters, for parking in city rights-of-way and other city-controlled parking areas under the jurisdiction of Seattle Transportation shall be within rate limits established by ordinance. Rates may vary according to location, time of day, maximum parking time allowed, the capabilities of available parking payment devices, and any other factors the Director determines are pertinent. In setting rates, the Director is not subject to Chapter 3.02 of the Seattle Municipal Code.

 B. In establishing parking rates, the Director shall consider the following objectives:

 1. To maintain adequate turnover of on-street parking spaces and reduce incidents of meter feeding in commercial districts;

 2. To discourage long-term commuter and employee parking in on- street parking areas and encourage use of off-street parking facilities; and

 3. To reduce congestion in travel lanes caused by drivers seeking on-street parking.

 Section 3. The Director of Seattle Transportation is authorized to set parking rates, pursuant to Seattle Municipal Code Sections 11.16.120 and 11.16.121, up to the following limits, starting January 1, 2004:

 a. Short-term parking spaces with time limits of 30 minutes or less and Commercial Vehicle Load Zones: $2.00 per hour per parking space;

 b. All other parking spaces: $1.50 per hour per parking space.

 Section 4. The following portion of the attachment to Resolution 28986, reaffirmed in Section 1 of Resolution 30585, is rescinded:

 *****

~~PARKING METER RATES~~ The City Council has authority to set parking meter rates. The Director of Engineering has authority to make recommendations to the City Council for parking meter rates (Municipal Code 11.16.120).

 Additional revenue and rate information is included in appendices 2 and 3.

 CURRENT PARKING METER RATE-SETTING PRACTICES

 While there are no written practices or policies which are used to set parking meter rates in Seattle, parking meter rates have been established based on two different techniques. One technique is based upon parking management (PM) studies, and the other technique is based upon budget considerations. PM criteria uses data from parking usage, parking turnover, meter-feeding, off-street parking rates, and enforcement to set a parking rate which best represents the needs of the community the meters serve. Parking rates set by budget considerations are driven by the City's need for revenues which pay for vital services such as police and fire.

 Generally, rate changes based on PM rationale are accepted, or even requested by the community. Community acceptance is common because clear evidence is shown that typical long-term usage and meter-feeding is high, and turnover is low. By raising rates, meter-feeders choose off-street locations, and good turnover is once again established (as is desired by the business community). Past examples of communities where PM rationale was used for rate changes is the Downtown, University, and Broadway districts.

 PROPOSED PARKING METER RATE-SETTING POLICY

 It is proposed that parking meter rates shall be set based upon parking management goals, which are designed to enhance business and community needs. However, the executive and City Council may increase rates for the purpose of raising revenue, providing that the increases are consistent with parking management goals stated below. The City shall inform affected business districts of proposed rate increases in their districts. Current meter rates will remain as they are in order to serve as a base for future analysis.

 Parking management goals in setting parking meter rates will be to:

 1) Establish a rate which drives a parking turnover rate of 85% at 2- hour meters (85% of users stay two hours or less).

 2) Have a meter-feeding rate less than 15%. (This is equivalent to one space per block being used by a meter feeder.)

 These goals would serve the community well, as parking turnover at a reasonable rate would be established. Enforcement strategies could be refined to encourage users to follow the rules of parking meter use.

 Currently, detailed (and costly) parking usage and turnover studies are required to establish the criteria listed above. These studies would have to be funded as needed. New technology could provide a significant cost and time savings, as data from electronic meters can be used to establish an occupancy and turnover rate at metered spaces.

 These policies should be adopted by City Council resolution. The code (11.16.120) for having the Director of Engineering making meter rate recommendations to the City Council is already in place.

 Section 5. This ordinance shall take effect and be in force thirty (30) days from and after its approval by the Mayor, but if not approved and returned by the Mayor within ten (10) days after presentation, it shall take effect as provided by Municipal Code Section 1.04.020.
