 DIRECTOR'S REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION -

 FLOOR AREA RATIOS IN THE FIRST HILL URBAN VILLAGE

 Introduction

 The Department of Design, Construction and Land Use (DCLU) is proposing an amendment to the Land Use Code to adjust Floor Area Ratios (FAR)1 for lots zoned NC3/160' that are located within the First Hill Urban Village.

 Current FAR standards, in combination with applicable development standards, have resulted in the unintended consequence of having to provide a minimum of three different uses within a single structure. Developers and building managers are reporting difficulty marketing at least one of these uses (in the current economic recession, administrative office is particularly hard hit). In addition, FAR limits on single uses within buildings are overly prescriptive and are not producing intended results.

 As part of a growing concern for the City's economic vitality, and in response to issues and trends identified by Seattle's development community, City Council and the Mayor's Office have asked that DCLU examine current regulations to find responsible ways to support the City's ongoing economic development efforts. Regardless of the City's economy, current FAR limits have constrained development opportunities that would otherwise enhance neighborhood and City goals for development.

 The underlying goal of the proposed amendment is to maintain the spirit and intent of existing City policies, while promoting the balanced development of Seattle's Urban Centers.

 Background

 The City has an extensive history of using Floor Area Ratios as a regulatory tool. Floor Area Ratios serve two main functions: one, they control the overall bulk and scale of new structures; and two, they limit the size of individual uses within structures, providing for a mix of uses within a single development. Specifically, Policy L202 of the Comprehensive Plan states, "Provide use and development standards for pedestrian oriented commercial zones which promote an environment conducive to walking and a mix of commercial and residential uses that promote the goals for these zones."

 Under current regulations, the allowed floor area of a given development is determined by multiplying the size of a lot by the allowable FAR. For example, a 20,000 square foot lot with an FAR of seven would be allowed 140,000 square feet of floor area (20,000 x 7 = 140,000). Development is then further regulated by limiting single uses to a portion of the maximum allowable floor area, by Land Use Code Section 23.47.012, Chart C:

 CHART C

 PERMITTED FLOOR AREA RATIO (FAR)

 Structures Higher than 65 Feet Height Limit Zones 85' 125' 160'

 Mixed Use Structure Total 6 6 7

 Any Single Use Within a

 Mixed Use Structure 4.5 5 5

 Single-Purpose Structure Total 4.5 5 5

 As an example, development in an NC3/160' zone is limited to a total FAR of seven. Single uses within such a development are limited to an FAR of five. When abutting certain streets, such as Madison Street, a development is required to provide pedestrian-oriented street-level uses (banks, restaurants, etc.), which account for approximately one half FAR. This leaves approximately six and one half FAR for other uses. Since, the limit for a single use is five FAR and the maximum is seven FAR, three different uses are needed in a single development or structure if the maximum FAR is to be achieved. This situation occurs, unless a developer under-develops the property, or takes other measures counter to market conditions, such as locating retail uses above street level, which is often unsuccessful outside the downtown retail core and shopping malls.

 Analysis

 Two examples are presented here as a demonstration of the need for changes to commercial FAR standards.

 Harbor Properties

 The first project, which remains in a preliminary design stage, is a two-site, full block development located on First Hill. 7th Avenue/Interstate 5, 8th Avenue, and Madison and Marion Streets surround the block, which is bisected by an alley that runs north and south. Harbor Properties, Inc. has secured control over the entire block and hopes to construct two structures, one per site.

 However, their desired program is limited by current FAR regulations. In order to satisfy current FAR regulations and the street level use requirements and efficiently develop the property, both structures would have to contain a minimum of three uses - non-residential use(s) at street level (other than administrative office), administrative office use and residential use. Harbor Properties has maintained that because one of the lots abuts Interstate 5, any residential use on that site would be undesirable. Harbor Properties also would like to respect the First Hill Neighborhood Plan's preference for residential uses to be located along 8th Avenue.

 AvalonBay

 The second project is a 15 story mixed use building designed to accommodate a street level grocery store, four floors of administrative office and 154 apartments. Construction of the project, which is located at the southeast corner of 8th Avenue and Madison Street, was halted last year because of sinking office and residential markets.

 The issues faced by AvalonBay reinforce the need for flexibility in the City's FAR regulations. In a slowing economy residential and administrative office markets are typically both on the decline. However, if even one of these markets were to experience resurgence, current regulations would still require projects, such as AvalonBay's to provide both administrative office and residential uses, in addition to the street level grocery store. If regulations were flexible enough to allow the office or the residential use to be eliminated, AvalonBay has said that construction would likely recommence earlier than is currently expected.

 In response to the issues presented by these representative examples, DCLU re-evaluated the standards that were developed more than fifteen years ago. We are now seeing consequences that were not envisioned at the time. DCLU is now recommending that standards be amended to allow development with one or two uses, including street level nonresidential uses (typically retail), instead of three uses. Such an amendment would achieve City and neighborhood goals for mixed use development with appropriate uses at the street level, while leaving a developer flexibility in the overall uses contained within a structure.

 RECOMMENDATIONS

 The current proposal specifically addresses conditions limited to NC3/160' zones within the First Hill Urban Village. DCLU is recommending a two stage approach. The first stage is the proposed amendment, which focuses on the First Hill Neighborhood, as illustrated by the two examples. A second stage will extend discussions to include similar citywide conditions, which may warrant further amendments to the FAR provisions in commercial zones.

 The newly formatted floor area ratio requirements would provide increased incentive to provide housing in the First Hill Urban Village by not subjecting residential use to floor area limits, similar to regulations that apply downtown.

 The amendment and its associated subsections, in bold, are explained in detail below:

 o The following Floor Area Ratio (FAR) provisions apply to lots zoned NC3/160' and located within the First Hill Urban Village:

 Conditions warranted addressing the First Hill Urban Village first. The limited area zoned for 160' height limits throughout the city; the proximity of the First Hill Urban Village to the downtown office market; the concentration of major institution uses in the neighborhood; and the desire to strengthen the residential neighborhood support these efforts to adjust FAR requirements to achieve Comprehensive and Neighborhood Plan goals.

 o Residential floor area is exempt from FAR limits.

 Excluding residential use from FAR calculations is consistent with regulations applicable in the City's downtown zones, where FAR is a valuable tool in managing the density of new office development. Exempting residential floor area will also strengthen the incentive for the development of residential uses within mixed use buildings. Single purpose residential buildings are not permitted, thereby, encouraging a pedestrian-oriented mixed use neighborhood where residents will not be reliant on automobiles. The height, bulk and scale of new structures will be controlled by the existing height limit of 160 feet, by existing development standards such as residential lot coverage, and the application of design guidelines.

 o The maximum FAR for single purpose nonresidential structures is five (5) unless the street front is occupied by retail sales and service uses.

 Traditionally, existing mixed use policy has been defined to mean a mix of residential and nonresidential uses. The maximum FAR limit for mixed use buildings, designed to the standards prescribed under the Land Use Code, remains unchanged. However, when no residential use is anticipated, a single-purpose commercial structure is permitted. Although, without retail sales and service uses at ground level, commercial structures will be limited to a five (5) FAR.

 This requirement will ensure that administrative office buildings, proposed in this area due to the neighborhood's proximity to downtown or medical institutions, will not exceed a five (5) FAR. Where office use would not be a feature of the structure at street level and with the inclusion of retail sales and services and a livelier, pedestrian street front, two additional FAR would be permitted.

 The maximum FAR of seven (7) is consistent with historical limits intended to control the impacts resulting from commercial or office development in neighborhoods surrounding downtown.

 Existing development standards, including limits on height and lot coverage, and requirements for parking, open space, and landscaping, will continue to provide necessary safeguards against potential height, bulk and scale impacts to surrounding properties.

 In addition to complying with development standards, new projects that exceed thresholds will be required to undergo project specific environmental and design review. These reviews focus on the environmental and design related impacts of a project on neighboring properties and surrounding area and, are used to condition a development to mitigate negative design and environmental impacts.

 First Hill Neighborhood Plan Goals

 The First Hill Neighborhood Plan lists the following development objectives for the Madison Street District:

 o Create a well-lit, pedestrian-friendly urban village in North First Hill.

 o Create a "critical mass" of housing, transit and shops near the light rail station.

 o Increase the variety and hours of businesses on Madison to appeal to residents and employees.

 Comprehensive Plan Goals

 Seattle's Comprehensive Plan outlines goals and policies for Mixed Use Commercial Areas, as well as guidelines for development in Pedestrian Oriented Commercial Zones and General Commercial Zones. According to the plan, "Goals represent the results of that the City hopes to realize over time, perhaps within the twenty-year life of the plan... Whether expressed in terms of numbers or only as directions for future change, goals are not guarantees or mandates. The plan also states, "Policies should be read as if preceded by the words 'it is the City's general policy to'..." The following policies are applicable to the proposed Land Use Code amendment.

 Goal LG67 Provide zones with a wide range of character and function that serve the employment, service, retail and housing needs of Seattle's existing and future population.

 Policy L156 Recognize a range of commercial zone classifications, which allow for different mixes and intensities of activity, varying scales of development, and varying degrees of pedestrian or auto orientation and relationship to surrounding areas, in order to accommodate desired development while maintaining compatibility with adjacent neighborhoods.

 Policy L158 Generally permit a greater intensity of development in mixed use structures in pedestrian and transit supportive environments.

 Description and Location of Affected Properties

 In total, thirty-six parcels will be directly affected by the proposed ordinance. The parcels are generally located on either side of Madison Street, bordered on the east by Broadway and on the west by Interstate 5. A majority of the parcels are located in a P1 Pedestrian Overlay, which requires certain pedestrian friendly uses at the street level. Specifically, the affected area is mapped below.

 Conclusion

 The proposed amendment provides for increased regulatory flexibility. The amendment is consistent with established land use policies, which call for the encouragement of responsible mixed use development, while promoting the economic health of the City.

 Specific to this ordinance, the City's Comprehensive Plan emphasizes the need for a mixture of residential and nonresidential uses, as well as ensuring compatibility of uses and structures in Seattle's neighborhoods. Overall, the proposal grants such flexibility while maintaining the purpose and intent of existing policy.

 The Department of Design, Construction and Land Use recommends approval of the proposed Land Use Code amendment applicable to new development in NC3-160 zones in the First Hill Urban Village.

 1 "Floor area ratio" means a ratio expressing the relationship between the amount of gross floor area permitted in a structure and the area of the lot on which the structure is located.
