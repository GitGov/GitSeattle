 WHEREAS, the current criterion requiring a determination of what income is necessary to live "frugally, but adequately " is subjective and ambiguous; and

 WHEREAS, the current criteria are difficult to administer; and

 WHEREAS, a standard of 200% of the federal poverty level is a common determinative of eligibility for various social service and economic assistance programs used by the Human Services Department within the City of Seattle; NOW, THEREFORE,

 Section 1. Subsection B of Seattle Municipal Code Section 20.12.020, which section was last amended by Ordinance 104953, is amended as follows:

~~1. His or her current income does not exceed the income eligibility criteria scaled by family size prepared annually by the Budget Director from data supplied by the United States of America, Department of Labor to indicate an income necessary for such a person (and family) to live frugally, but adequately within the City; provided that such computations do not include (a) educational loans and grants which preclude their use for current living costs, (b) child support or alimony, (c) earnings of minors under eighteen (18) and earnings of full-time students;~~

~~2.

 Section 2. Seattle Municipal Code Section 20.12.080, as last amended by Ordinance 120794, is amended by deleting Subsection B, re-lettering Subsection C as B and amending it as follows:

~~C.~~B.
