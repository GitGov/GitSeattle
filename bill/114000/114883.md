 ORDINANCE _________________

 AN ORDINANCE relating to the Cedar River Watershed; authorizing the cutting and removal of certain trees for non-commercial purposes and reasons consistent with the Cedar River Watershed Habitat Conservation Plan (HCP) and Ordinances 121040 and 121212 in Township 22 North, Ranges 7 and 8 East, and Township 23 North Range 7 East, W.M.; declaring the logs resulting from such action to be surplus to the City's needs; authorizing the sale of such logs pursuant to applicable City contracting or surplus property sale procedures; directing deposit of the proceeds therefrom to the Water Fund for the purposes of HCP implementation; and increasing an appropriation to Seattle Public Utilities in the 2004 Budget.

 WHEREAS, in 1999, following several years of technical studies, negotiations with federal and state agencies and review by public groups and individuals, the City Council adopted Resolution 29977 authorizing the Mayor to submit the Final HCP and other related documents for federal review and issuance of an "incidental take permit" under the federal Endangered Species Act, and to execute on behalf of the City the HCP and related agreements, which together establish the City's long-term commitments regarding watershed habitat protection and mitigation for impacts resulting from the presence and operation of certain City-owned facilities; and

 WHEREAS, in 2000, the City received the incidental take permit and executed the HCP and related agreements; and

 WHEREAS, the HCP allows removal of trees for certain purposes, including the maintenance of rights-of-way to protect public safety and preserve access and the management of gravel and rock pits to support road maintenance and improvement; and

 WHEREAS, in 2002, Ordinance 121040 clarified certain differences between the forest management policies contained in the Secondary Use Policies (adopted by Ordinance 114632) and those contained in the HCP; prohibited the harvesting of trees for commercial purposes on City-owned land within the Watershed; authorized the cutting of trees for certain limited non-commercial reasons; provided limited authority for the sale of logs resulting from such non-commercial cutting; and directed that the proceeds from such sales shall be deposited in the Water Fund and further dedicated for the purpose of offsetting the costs of implementing the HCP; and

 WHEREAS, the limited non-commercial purposes and reasons for cutting and removal of trees allowed by Ordinance 121040 include the maintenance of roads, trails, utility rights-of-way; extraction of gravel and rock necessary for construction and maintenance of roads and other facilities; and incidental salvage and removal of trees damaged or downed by storm, pursuant to and subject to the limitations prescribed in the HCP; and

 WHEREAS, Ordinance 121040 further provided that any sales of such trees exceeding 250,000 board feet must be authorized by separate ordinance; and

 WHEREAS, on December 3, 2003, the Puget Sound region experienced a severe windstorm that resulted in the blowdown of a large number of trees in the Cedar River Watershed over an area of about 6,000 acres, including many trees across and along forest roads and the Bonneville Power Administration (BPA) and other rights-of-way in the watershed; and

 WHEREAS, it was and is necessary to clear watershed roads of damaged and down trees to allow road access and maintenance and to protect public safety; and

 WHEREAS, as part of the program to maintain and improve forest roads it is necessary to clear trees on approximately 5 acres from a rock pit in the watershed; and

 WHEREAS, under terms of an electric power transmission line easement granted by the City to the BPA by Ordinance 121212, BPA has the right to cut "danger trees' that could damage the power lines or interfere with their maintenance, and BPA has provided notice that it intends to exercise that right with respect to the numerous new danger trees created as a result of the windstorm; and

 WHEREAS, a risk evaluation indicated that there is risk that Douglas fir beetles expected to invade the large volume of dead wood may then spread to and kill many more living trees, and monitoring the beetle population and its effects is needed to manage that risk; and

 WHEREAS, staff of Seattle Public Utilities has surveyed the trees now down or to be cut as a result of the above-described reasons and estimates that salvage operations could result in up to 1,200,000 board feet of merchantable logs; NOW THEREFORE,

 BE IT ORDAINED BY THE CITY OF SEATTLE AS FOLLOWS:

 Section 1. The Director of Seattle Public Utilities is hereby authorized to contract, pursuant to applicable City contracting or surplus property sale procedures and subject to the right of first refusal granted to Mountain Tree Farm Company by the 1962 Cedar River Watershed Cooperative Agreement, for the service of completing the clearing of watershed road rights-of-way and the removal of logs from those roads and from roads that were previously cleared, for the removal of trees down or cut by BPA on and along their electric power transmission line right-of-way; and for removal of trees cleared from the 30.1 road rock pit, all located in Townships 22 North, Ranges 7 and 8 East, and Township 23 North Range 7 East, W.M., which contract may provide for the sale and removal of up to 1 million board feet of merchantable logs resulting from such clearing and removal.
