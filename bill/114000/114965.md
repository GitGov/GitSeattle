 G. The term "fiscal year" shall mean one fiscal year of the Government. The Government fiscal year begins on October 1 and ends on September 30.

 ARTICLE II - OBLIGATIONS OF PARTIES

 A. The Government, using funds and in-kind services provided by the Sponsor and funds appropriated by the Congress of the United States, shall expeditiously prosecute and complete the Study, in accordance with the provisions of this Agreement and Federal laws, regulations, and policies.

 B. In accordance with this Article and Article III.A., III.B. and III.C. of this Agreement, the Sponsor shall contribute cash and in- kind services equal to fifty (50) percent of Study Costs other than excess Study Costs. The Sponsor may, consistent with applicable law and regulations, contribute up to 50 percent of Study Costs through the provision of in-kind services. The in-kind services to be provided by the Sponsor, the estimated negotiated costs for those services, and the estimated schedule under which those services are to be provided are specified in the PMP. Negotiated costs shall be subject to an audit by the Government to determine reasonableness, allocability, and allowability.

 C. The Sponsor shall pay a fifty (50) percent share of excess Study Costs in accordance with Article III.D. of this Agreement.

 D. The Sponsor understands that the schedule of work may require the Sponsor to provide cash or in-kind services at a rate that may result in the Sponsor temporarily diverging from the obligations concerning cash and in-kind services specified in paragraph B. of this Article. Such temporary divergences shall be identified in the quarterly reports provided for in Article III.A. of this Agreement and shall not alter the obligations concerning costs and services specified in paragraph B. of this Article or the obligations concerning payment specified in Article III of this Agreement.

 E. If, upon the award of any contract or the performance of any in- house work for the Study by the Government or the Sponsor, cumulative financial obligations of the Government and the Sponsor would result in excess Study Costs, the Government and the Sponsor agree to defer award of that and all subsequent contracts, and performance of that and all subsequent in-house work, for the Study until the Government and the Sponsor agree to proceed. Should the Government and the sponsor require time to arrive at a decision, the Agreement will be suspended in accordance with Article X., for a period of not to exceed six months. In the event the Government and the sponsor have not reached an agreement to proceed by the end of their 6 month period, the Agreement may be subject to termination in accordance with Article X.

 F. No Federal funds may be used to meet the Sponsor's share of Study Costs unless the Federal granting agency verifies in writing that the expenditure of such funds is expressly authorized by statute.

 G. The award and management of any contract with a third party in furtherance of this Agreement which obligates Federal appropriations shall be exclusively within the control of the Government. The award and management of any contract by the Sponsor with a third party in furtherance of this Agreement which obligates funds of the Sponsor and does not obligate Federal appropriations shall be exclusively within the control of the Sponsor, but shall be subject to applicable Federal laws and regulations.

 ARTICLE III - METHOD OF PAYMENT

 A. The Government shall maintain current records of contributions provided by the parties, current projections of Study Costs, current projections of each party's share of Study Costs, and current projections of the amount of Study Costs that will result in excess Study Costs. At least quarterly, the Government shall provide the Sponsor a report setting forth this information. As of the effective date of this Agreement, estimated Study Costs are $9,517,698 and the Sponsor's share of estimated Study Costs is $4,758,849 . In order to meet the Sponsor's cash payment requirements for its share of estimated Study Costs, the Sponsor must provide a cash contribution currently estimated to be $0. The dollar amounts set forth in this Article are based upon the Government's best estimates, which reflect the scope of the study described in the PMP, projected costs, price- level changes, and anticipated inflation. Such cost estimates are subject to adjustment by the Government and are not to be construed as the total financial responsibilities of the Government and the Sponsor.

 B. The Sponsor shall provide its cash contribution required under Article II.B. of this Agreement in accordance with the following provisions:

 1. For purposes of budget planning, the Government shall notify the Sponsor by June 1 of each year of the estimated funds that will be required from the Sponsor to meet the Sponsor's share of Study Costs for the upcoming fiscal year.

 2. No later than 60 calendar days prior to the scheduled date for the Government's issuance of the solicitation for the first contract for the Study or for the Government's anticipated first significant in- house expenditure for the Study, the Government shall notify the Sponsor in writing of the funds the Government determines to be required from the Sponsor to meet its required share of Study Costs for the first fiscal year of the Study. No later than 30 calendar days thereafter, the Sponsor shall provide the Government the full amount of the required funds by delivering a check payable to "FAO, USAED, Seattle" to the District Engineer.

 3. For the second and subsequent fiscal years of the Study, the Government shall, no later than 60 calendar days prior to the beginning of the fiscal year, notify the Sponsor in writing of the funds the Government determines to be required from the Sponsor to meet its required share of Study Costs for that fiscal year, taking into account any temporary divergences identified under Article II.D of this Agreement. No later than 30 calendar days prior to the beginning of the fiscal year, the Sponsor shall make the full amount of the required funds available to the Government through the funding mechanism specified in paragraph B.2. of this Article.

 4. The Government shall draw from the funds provided by the Sponsor such sums as the Government deems necessary to cover the Sponsor's share of contractual and in-house fiscal obligations attributable to the Study as they are incurred.

 5. In the event the Government determines that the Sponsor must provide additional funds to meet its share of Study Costs, the Government shall so notify the Sponsor in writing. No later than 60 calendar days after receipt of such notice, the Sponsor shall make the full amount of the additional required funds available through the funding mechanism specified in paragraph B.2. of this Article.

 C. Within ninety (90) days after the conclusion of the Study Period or termination of this Agreement, the Government shall conduct a final accounting of Study Costs, including disbursements by the Government of Federal funds, cash contributions by the Sponsor, the amount of any excess Study Costs, and credits for the negotiated costs of the Sponsor, and shall furnish the Sponsor with the results of this accounting. Within thirty (30) days thereafter, the Government, subject to the availability of funds, shall reimburse the Sponsor for the excess, if any, of cash contributions and credits given over its required share of Study Costs, other than excess Study Costs, or the Sponsor shall provide the Government any cash contributions required for the Sponsor to meet its required share of Study Costs other than excess Study Costs.

 SECTION 1 - INTRODUCTION

 1.1 OVERVIEW AND AUTHORITY

 This study is authorized by the Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure, U.S. House of Representatives, House Resolution 2704, September 25, 2002, which reads as follows:

 Resolved by the Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure of the United States House of Representatives, That the Secretary of the Army is requested to review the Comprehensive Study of Water and Related Land Resources for Puget Sound and Adjacent Waters, State of Washington, dated 1971, and other pertinent reports to determine whether modification and recommendations contained therein are advisable at the present time in the interest of storm damage prevention, shoreline protection, environmental restoration and protection, and related purposes in Elliott Bay, Washington, including the rehabilitation of the Alaskan Way seawall.

 This Project Management Plan (PMP) is hereby attached to the Feasibility Cost Sharing Agreement (FCSA) entitled "Agreement Between the Department of the Army and the City of Seattle for the Elliott Bay Seawall, Seattle, Washington, Storm Damage Reduction Study," in accordance with Article I E of the FCSA. The PMP is the blueprint for conducting the feasibility phase of project development. It documents the work requirements and the level of detail that will be necessary to describe the future without project and future with-project conditions, formulate a range of alternative measures, assess their effects, and present a clear rationale for the selection of a storm damage reduction plan for the City of Seattle ("City" or "Sponsor"). The PMP performs the function described in the FCSA. The PMP is a tool for implementing the FCSA, including estimating and monitoring study costs, in-kind services, and schedules for conducting the feasibility phase.

 The PMP does not attempt to repeat all project-related information provided in the October 2003 reconnaissance report (Section 905(b) Analysis). The reconnaissance report should be referred to for a detailed description of the reconnaissance studies and related investigations conducted prior to initiating the feasibility phase of project development.

 1.2 PROJECT AREA LOCATION

 The study area is along the Elliott Bay shoreline, within the central business district of the City of Seattle, Washington (see Figure 1). Seattle is a major port city for trans-Pacific and European trade. The Port of Seattle is the fifth largest (in dollar value) container port in the United States handling $32 billion worth of products each year. The seawall extends for a distance of approximately 7,900 feet. The southern terminus of the wall abuts the Port of Seattle bulkheads and falls in the vicinity of Pier 48. The northern terminus of the seawall ends at the southern end of Myrtle Edwards Park, where it abuts natural slopes that have been armored with heavy rip-rap. The wall is interrupted in places by fill, so that the total length of wall structure is actually somewhat less than 7,900 feet.

 Figure 1: Project Location

 1.3 PROJECT SPONSORSHIP

 The City of Seattle, Washington, is the non-Federal sponsor of the feasibility study. The City has been involved in the development of this PMP and will provide local match through in-kind services for the feasibility study, as prescribed in the FCSA and this PMP.

 1.4 PROJECT BACKGROUND

 Following the Nisqually earthquake of February 2001, the City of Seattle, Washington State Department of Transportation (WSDOT) and Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) inspected both the seawall and the Alaska Way Viaduct for earthquake damage. The inspection revealed that the earthquake had damaged the viaduct but not the seawall. However, marine borers had caused severe deterioration of the seawall. Both structures are now considered to be at or near the ends of their design lives. In 2001, the City and their partner agencies formed a team that began planning the replacement of the viaduct and the seawall. Because the two structures are so closely linked, the team planned the replacement of the two structures as one project. The team has put significant effort into developing alternatives and examining their costs, benefits, and impacts. The Corps is now joining the project that began in 2001. We are evaluating only the seawall structure, but that structure is part of a larger project. The Corps will begin the planning process by evaluating the work already performed.

 The Corps' reconnaissance report, approved by Corps headquarters on 17 October, 2003, demonstrated that there is a Federal interest in pursuing a feasibility phase study to examine the feasibility of a project that will protect the public facilities and economic activities along the Elliott Bay shoreline from storm damages. Information contained in the reconnaissance report, as well as that in the City's previous engineering analyses and the AWVSR Team's draft EIS will be used as a base from which to continue the required detailed project development and implementation studies. The feasibility study report will thus reflect current problems and opportunities, and the desires of the sponsor and views of the public, establish final planning criteria and planning objectives used to formulate plans, identify additional measures necessary to meet the final planning objectives, and document the formulation and evaluation of alternative plans and basis for plan selection.

 1.5 STUDY PURPOSE

 The purpose of the feasibility phase of project development is to formulate a plan to address the storm damage risk associated with the seriously deteriorated seawall along Elliott Bay in Seattle. The sponsor's objective is a long-term solution to storm damage that will protect public infrastructure and economic activity in the project area. The recommended plan that will be set forth in the feasibility report must be both a technically viable and an implementable solution to the storm damage problem.

 The feasibility study will investigate and identify solutions to identified water resources problems and recommend either for or against Corps of Engineers authorization of a storm damage reduction project. The final feasibility report will provide a complete presentation of the study analyses and results, including those developed in the reconnaissance report. The feasibility report will also document compliance with all applicable guidance, statutes, Executive Orders and Administration policy. The feasibility report will thus be the basis for decision on Corps of Engineers authorization.

 1.6 PURPOSE AND SCOPE OF PROJECT MANAGEMENT PLAN

 The purpose of a PMP is to be a roadmap for quality project delivery, guiding the project delivery team through the development of a Feasibility Report and environmental documentation that describes the formulation and evaluation of a storm damage reduction project. The PMP defines the scope of the study, tasks, and schedule for completing the feasibility study. It also serves to allocate responsibilities and costs between the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers ("Corps' or "Government") and City of Seattle and can be used to justify any necessary future negotiated modifications. The PMP provides a common understanding between City of Seattle and the Corps' Seattle District as to needs and expectations for project delivery. Specifically, the PMP addresses the following:

 * Study tasks as well as responsibility for their accomplishment.

 * The estimated cost of individual study tasks and total study cost, including the negotiated cost of work items to be accomplished by City of Seattle as in-kind services.

 * Corps and other professional criteria to assess the adequacy of the completed work effort, including references to regulations and other guidance that will be followed in performing and evaluating the tasks.

 * The schedule of performance and milestones (i.e., key decision points, including in-progress reviews, issue resolution conferences, etc.).

 * The specific coordination mechanism between the Corps and City of Seattle.

 * Procedures for reviewing and accepting work as an in-kind credit performed by City of Seattle.

 The PMP was developed consistent with the requirements of the Corps' Engineer Regulation (ER) 1105-2-100, ER 5-1-11, and related guidance. The Project Delivery Team and Executive Committee will use this PMP to facilitate effective communication and oversee the execution of study tasks within time and budget. Because the planning process is dynamic, the stated tasks, scope, budget, and schedule for completion may change. Any proposed changes in the PMP will be fully coordinated with the Executive Committee in accordance with the terms of the FSCA and the PMP will be updated and the FCSA amended as appropriate.

 1.7 PLANNING PROCESS

 The Corps' planning process is a structured approach to problem solving. It involves six steps that include (1) identifying problems and opportunities, (2) inventorying and forecasting conditions, (3) formulating alternative plans, (4) evaluating alternative plans, (5) comparing alternative plans, and (6) selecting a plan. This process was initiated with the Corps' reconnaissance report. The process will continue in the feasibility phase, with major study activities sequenced as follows:

 * Review and incorporate Alaskan Way Viaduct and Seawall replacement studies already completed by the AWVSR Team. The AWVSR Team has completed extensive studies into the current condition of the existing shore protection, the probable modes of shore protection failure, and alternatives for new shore protection. The AWVSR Team has assembled a large team of engineering consultants, who have produced a large volume of work, which may closely approximate the Corps planning process, especially steps 1 through 5.

 * Document the without project condition. Careful documentation of the without project condition is critical for establishing a Federal interest in the project as defined in the Water Resources Development Act. The Corps will utilize the AWVSR Team's existing information to the greatest extent possible in the without project condition documentation. The cost of the proposed project is very high, and a careful and complete documentation of the without project condition will be needed to justify a Corps recommendation for authorization as a Federal project.

 * Formulate and evaluate alternative plans and select a recommended plan. The Corps will review previous work on formulation of alternatives to verify that the work has satisfied Corps' planning requirements. If the Corps is able to adopt the AWVSR Team's alternatives formulation, the Corps will proceed to identify the National Economic Development (NED) plan. If additional formulation is required, a rescope of the additional effort may be necessary and will result in a revision to this PMP. There is a mutual understanding that the AWVSR Team will select a Locally Preferred Plan (LPP) by the time the Corps identifies a NED plan. If the plans do not coincide, it is understood that Executive Committee may recommend the Locally Preferred Plan and base the recommended project cost sharing on the NED plan.

 * Prepare draft feasibility report and Environmental Documentation. A draft feasibility report and necessary environmental documentation will be prepared and issued for public review. The AWVSR Team will have an EIS prepared prior to the draft feasibility report, and the Corps environmental compliance will be documented in material supplementary to that EIS. The draft feasibility report will include engineering, economics and real estate appendixes. A formal public meeting will be held prior to the end of the draft report public review period.

 * Prepare final feasibility report and Final Environmental documentation. Following public review, a final feasibility report and final environmental documentation will be prepared and submitted for review and approval at the Washington, D.C., level.

 * Washington Level Review and Approval Support. The Seattle District and City of Seattle will perform those tasks necessary to support the Washington, D.C. level review processing of the feasibility report.

 As the Corps feasibility study begins, the City and their partners have already progressed through the planning process by setting goals and objectives, outlining three without project conditions, formulating alternatives, developing the alternatives, and partially evaluating the alternatives. A draft EIS has been published by the City, the Washington State Department of Transportation and the Federal Highway Administration (the Alaskan Way Viaduct/Seawall Replacement or "AWVSR" Team), covering the complete viaduct and seawall project. By the time the FCSA is signed with the City of Seattle, the AWVSR Team may have recommended a plan. To facilitate the planning process, the Corps will utilize the AWVSR Team's work as much as is applicable to the Corps' study. This review process will comprise one of two concurrent phases. The Corps will review this process, and, to the extent that the work meets the Corps' standards and requirements, adopt the work. If the Corps finds that additional work is needed, that work will be performed. The Corps will use the existing EIS and supporting technical reports to the extent that they meet the Corps' requirements. At this time, the Corps anticipates preparing some additional supplementation to the AWVSR team EIS, focusing on the environmental impacts during construction of the seawall project, not yet specified in the EIS. The design development phase will be concurrent to the review phase and will ensure that the Corps is able to participate and cost-share in necessary design development with the City, in order to maintain aggressive project schedule. Figure 2 demonstrates the concurrent two-phase approach to the Corps planning process.

 Figure 2: Project Development Strategy

 SECTION 2 - PROJECT MANAGEMENT

 The specific management and coordination mechanisms between the Corps of Engineers and City of Seattle are described below. Study management and coordination are generally described in Article IV of the FCSA, which provides for an Executive Committee to oversee the feasibility study and a Project Delivery Team to manage and conduct the day-to-day study activities.

 2.1 EXECUTIVE COMMITTEE

 Members of the Elliott Bay Seawall Study Executive Committee are identified in Table 2. Meetings of the Executive Committee will be scheduled, at a minimum, on a quarterly basis. More frequent meetings will be scheduled, as required. The Corps Project Manager, acting on behalf of the PDT, will provide periodic status reports to the Executive Committee.

 2.2 PROJECT STAKEHOLDERS

 There are a number of stakeholders associated with this project, many with multiple interests. The following stakeholders have had direct involvement in the study:

 * Federal Highways Administration

 * U.S. Environmental Protection Agency

 * Burlington Northern-Santa Fe Railroad

 * Union Pacific Railroad

 * Port of Seattle

 * People for Puget Sound

 * Business Owners along the downtown Seattle waterfront

 * Users of the downtown Seattle waterfront

 * Others

 2.3 PROJECT DELIVERY TEAM

 The Project Delivery Team (PDT) is led by the Corps Project Manager, in coordination with the Corps Assistant Project Manager, Corps Environmental Coordinator, and the City of Seattle Project Manager. The Corps Project Manager will be responsible for overall day-to-day management of the feasibility phase study. He/she will maintain close coordination with the PDT, to ensure timely prosecution of the study and compliance with the FCSA and PMP. The Corps' Project Manager and Environmental Coordinator and will meet and confer with the City of Seattle Project Manager on a regular basis throughout the study to coordinate study prosecution and progress.

 The PDT is composed of qualified staff from the Seattle District, the City of Seattle, and other members of the AWVSR team. Various consultants and contractors may provide assistance. The PDT members are listed in Table 2. Team meetings will be scheduled periodically, as required by study activities or issues.

 2.4 STATUS REPORTS

 The Corps Project Manager, in coordination with the City of Seattle Project Manager, will prepare and distribute study status reports, with appropriate input from the PDT. The reports will identify progress of work items during the period, projected and actual costs through the last reporting period, as well as document unresolved conflicts or policy issues requiring action by the Executive Committee. In addition, any revisions of the PMP will be coordinated with the Executive Committee. Project managers will exchange weekly progress status reports to provide up-to-date accounting of task progress, and quarterly financial reports to provide up-to-date accounting of study expenditures, including documentation and crediting of City of Seattle in-kind services.

 2.5 REVIEW AND ACCEPTANCE OF WORK

 The PDT, under the direction of the Corp Project Manager, will monitor and review all work. PDT review and acceptance of work items, including contracts, will be documented in the study status reports submitted to the Executive Committee. The Corps Project Manager, acting through the PDT, will immediately bring any disagreements about the acceptability of completed work to the attention of the Executive Committee.

 SECTION 3 - STUDY REQUIREMENTS, WORK BREAKDOWN STRUCTURE AND COST- SHARING ORGANIZATION

 3.1 STUDY REQUIREMENTS

 The work to be performed shall consist of the formulation and evaluation of alternative plans to address the storm damage problem at Elliott Bay and selection of a recommended plan. This will include: (1) developing a detailed plan and design; (2) preparing construction and operation and maintenance cost estimates for the recommended plan; (3) computing average annual benefits and costs; (4) evaluating technical and economic feasibility of the plan; (5) assessing environmental and social impacts, including impacts on biological resources, socio-economic conditions, cultural resources, and recreation; (6) addressing the views of the public through workshops and public meetings; (7) formulating plan mitigation measures; and (8) preparing the draft and final feasibility report and SEIS with required documentation to present the investigations and evaluations which support the selected plan.

 The end products will be a feasibility report and environmental documentation.

 The feasibility phase is expected to identify a plan for storm damage reduction that meets or exceeds project objectives, is both technically viable and implementable, has Corps and Sponsor support, and will provide economic benefits at a reasonable and affordable cost. Within this analysis, a non-structural alternative will be identified and evaluated. Specifically, a plan recommended for implementation must be:

 * Technically feasible from an engineering standpoint (i.e., sound engineering design).

 * Economically justified (with construction and maintenance costs such that national economic development benefits exceed costs over the 50- year period of economic evaluation). The NED plan will also be identified, if different from the recommended plan. The NED plan is the plan that meets planning objectives and maximizes net benefits.

 * Functionally complete. The recommended plan must provide a complete stand-alone solution that generates benefits sufficient to justify the project.

 * Supported by the project sponsor and stakeholders, and environmentally acceptable (able to meet permitting and regulatory requirements).

 The PMP thus defines and limits the work to that necessary to meet these requirements for a complete feasibility report.

 The preparation of the feasibility report will consist of writing the main body and associated appendixes, as well as environmental documentation. There will be a technical review conference (TRC), an alternative formulation briefing (AFB), and possibly a feasibility review conference (FRC). Senior staff from Seattle District, Northwestern Division, HQUSACE, and City of Seattle will participate in these briefings and conferences. The draft feasibility report and environmental documentation will be released for public review, and a public meeting is anticipated. The report will then be revised. When the final feasibility report and environmental documents are ready, they will be submitted to the Northwestern Division Engineer for further processing.

 Once the Division Engineer issues a Public Notice on the feasibility report, the report will then begin the Washington level review process. This process consists of filing the final NEPA/SEPA environmental documentation in the Federal Register following State and Federal agency review, submittal of the Chief of Engineer's report to the Assistant Secretary of the Army for Civil Works [ASA(CW)], and submittal of the ASA(CW) letter to the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) for review for consistency with the policies and programs of the President.

 3.2 WORK BREAKDOWN STRUCTURE

 A work breakdown structure (WBS) is applied to the study tasks and subtasks, creating a hierarchy of activities. The WBS provides a means for organizing the feasibility phase activities in a logical sequence and identifying products or deliverables through the various stages of the feasibility phase. The study tasks identified in the PMP are organized according to their associated WBS.

 NOTE: The anticipated deployment and implementation in fiscal year 2004 of P2, the Corps of Engineers' new Automated Information System (AIS) that supports the doctrine of ER 5-1-11, will necessitate the transformation of the WBS presented in the PMP to that required by P2.

 Table 3 provides the WBS for the feasibility study. This WBS is used for accounting and administrative purposes to track obligations and expenditures within the Corps of Engineers Financial Management System (CEFMS). The Work Category (WC) and Work Category Element (WCE) codes in CEFMS provide a representation of the study scope broken down into a hierarchy of activities. The codes are designated in CEFMS when in- house labor, and requests for goods and services (contracts and purchase orders) are obligated, as well as when sponsor in-kind services are credited.

 3.3 FEASIBILITY STUDY COST SHARING AND SCHEDULE

 The feasibility study cost estimate is summarized by Federal fiscal year (FY) in Table 4. The funding breakdown is tied to a schedule which calls for submittal of the final feasibility report to the Northwestern Division Commander in Portland, Oregon 26 months after signing the FCSA and initiating the study. Note that the "study period," as defined in the Agreement (Article I D), commences with the release to the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, Seattle District, of initial feasibility funds following execution of the Agreement. The study period, and thus the feasibility phase itself, ends when the Assistant Secretary of the Army (Civil Works) submits the feasibility report to the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) for review for consistency with the policies and programs of the President.

 SECTION 4 - FEASIBILITY STUDY WORK ITEMS

 4.1 PUBLIC INVOLVEMENT

 This task includes a multi-pronged approach to achieve coordination with stakeholders and the general public to provide opportunity for public comment on measures associated with providing storm damage reduction at Elliott Bay project area. This work will be closely coordinated with the AWVSR team. Education and increased awareness and exchange of viewpoints with the public are vital to the formulation of a technically viable and implementable storm damage reduction plan. Coordination with Native American tribes, state and Federal resource agencies, and interest groups and parties, is an also important component of the public involvement program. A number of methods of conveying information are identified, but not limited to, newsletters, advertisements, website, news releases and mailings. Through these methods, information conveyed may include summaries of technical information and informational displays. This work will lead to a summary of public comment within the environmental documentation and appropriate written narrative for the feasibility report. Reference: ER 1105-2-100.

 4.2 CULTURAL RESOURCES AND HISTORICAL STUDIES/REPORT

 This task involves a literature review and query of state GIS and databases for historical and archaeological materials to determine impacts of alternative plans upon historic and cultural resources. This is required under the National Historic Preservation Act. The Corps, in consultation with the Washington State Historical Preservation Office and the City, will perform any work that may not have been completed by the AWVSR Team.

 References: National Historic Preservation Act of 1966, Archeological and Historical Preservation Act of 1974, National Environmental Policy Act of 1969, Executive Order 11593 (Protection and Enhancement of the Cultural Environment), Native American Religious Freedom Act.

 4.3 ENVIRONMENTAL STUDIES/DOCUMENTATION

 This task includes reviewing the Draft EIS prepared by the AWVSR Team, the 25 Appendices to that document and any supporting studies and documentation. In addition, if required, it will include literature review and field studies and investigations required to document the environmental baseline of the study area and to identify impacts that would be associated with providing storm damage reduction measures at Elliott Bay project area. A number of discrete tasks and related study activities would be undertaken, as described below. Work will lead to a determination of whether additional environmental review is required, preparation of any required environmental documentation , and appropriate written narrative for the feasibility report. The Corps, its contractors, and the Sponsor will perform the work. Reference: ER 1105-2-100; ER 200-2-2.

 4.3.1. Collect and Review Existing Literature and/or Surveys in Project Area

 Review will focus on habitat, Federal and state endangered/threatened species and species of concern, and commercially important species. The field studies listed below may be modified after a thorough review of work already completed by the AWVSR Team, existing literature and surveys of the project area has been completed. Without the knowledge of this review, the following list of studies is recommended in order to fulfill the purpose of this project.

 4.3.2 Environmental Surveys

 Wildlife, fisheries, and habitat surveys will provide baseline data on existing site conditions. This baseline data is necessary for subsequent impact assessments that will predict changes to existing site conditions that could result from the various alternatives under future with-project conditions. These studies will also provide valuable and vital information for Endangered Species Act (ESA) Section 7 Biological Evaluations, where determinations on how construction activities and habitat changes would affect endangered and threatened species are made. The exact composition and extent of environmental surveys is a function of the range of alternative plans that must be evaluated in detail as part of plan formulation. The estimated cost of environmental surveys presented in the PMP identifies the probable upper limit of costs. Individual studies include use survey of species of concern and subtidal/intertidal habitat survey.

 4.3.3 Environmental Impact Assessment and Mitigation Plan Development

 Environmental impact assessment will determine how the baseline environmental conditions identified above would be changed by implementation of feasible alternatives under future with-project conditions. Impact assessments will largely correspond to the studied identified above. This information will be used in the plan formulation process. A mitigation plan will be developed to address unavoidable adverse environmental impacts that will result from the recommended plan.

 4.3.4` Prepare Draft and Final Environmental Documentation

 This task includes preparing any supplementation required for existing environmental impact documents, conducting the document review process and related environmental coordination, contract management, and production of the final environmental document. The City of Seattle/Washington State Department of Transportation EIS (in process) for the Alaskan Way Viaduct/Seawall project will be utilized to the maximum extent. Reference: 33 CFR Parts 230 and 325, and ER 1105-2- 100.

 4.3.5 Coordination/Analysis (in Addition to the NEPA Process)

 This task involves preparation of supporting documentation for the project that will not yet have been accomplished by the AWVSR Team, possibly including the 404(b)(1) analysis to demonstrate compliance with the Clean Water Act, Coastal Zone Management Act consistency determination, preparation of a biological assessment as required under Section 7 of the Endangered Species Act and preparation of the Clean Water Act 401 Certification application. It may also include Clean Water Act 402 permits, depending how storm water will be managed both during and after construction. This work involves extensive coordination with Federal and State agencies and the preparation of technical support documents. Reference: 40 CFR 230 and 33 CFR 320- 330; ER 200-2-2; ER 1105-2-100; Clean Water Act of 1972; Endangered Species Act of 1973; Costal Zone Management Act of 1972.

 4.4 FISH AND WILDLIFE COORDINATION ACT REPORT

 This subtask includes coordination with, and studies conducted by, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (USFWS), as required by the Fish and Wildlife Coordination Act (FWCA). USFWS activities will include interagency and tribal coordination, planning and evaluation of the impacts of alternative plans on fish and wildlife resources, and preparation of a draft and final Fish and Wildlife Coordination Act Report for the feasibility report. Related activities by the Corps will include preparation and coordination of statements of work and related fund transfer documents for planning activities by USFWS, plus review of the draft and final Fish and Wildlife Coordination Act Report by the Government and Sponsor, and incorporation of the report, or necessary portions of it, into the NEPA documentation. USFWS staff, with guidance and oversight by Corps environmental staff, will perform the work.

 Reference: Fish and Wildlife Coordination Act of 1958 (PL 85-624, as amended).

 4.5 ECONOMIC ANALYSIS/REPORT

 Social and Economic Studies/Appendix: This includes studies pertinent to an economic analysis of a major rehabilitation to the Elliott Bay Seawall under future without and with-project conditions. The economic analysis will quantify the future without-project damages and quantify damages reduced associated with a range of alternative plans including the optimum NED alternative plan. A financial analysis in support of the construction recommendation will also be prepared and will include a statement of Sponsor financial capability, a financial capability assessment, and a financing plan. The financing plan will provide detail as to the anticipated project implementation funding sources available to the Sponsor. Cost apportionment will delineate the Federal and Non-federal costs in design and construction phase. Federal cost share of design and construction of the recommended plan will be based upon the costs of the NED plan. Recreation features may be cost-shared in design phase and cost-shared at 50/50 in construction. No recreation features have yet been identified. An economic appendix to the feasibility report will be prepared. The appendix will include the results of all social and economic studies, plus benefit-to-cost analysis, maximization analysis, Federal versus non-Federal cost sharing computations, and determination of the NED plan. The Government will perform the economic and financial analysis, with input provided by the Sponsor. The Sponsor will develop the financing plan, coordinated with the Government. Reference: ER 1105-2- 100, Planning Guidance Notebook, Appendix D, Economic and Social Considerations (April, 2000).

Part 24, in acquiring lands, easements and rights-of-way required for the implementation, operation, and maintenance of the project.

 4.7 GEOTECHNICAL STUDIES/REPORT

 The geotechnical studies scope section is based on providing critical geotechnical data to support engineering, design and cost estimating for plan development, including the rebuild option formulated by the City team prior to the feasibility study. At the time of this document, the rebuild option is the most viable plan, and the City planning and engineering team is focusing on that plan.

 4.7.1. Geotechnical Explorations

 Field explorations and laboratory testing will be performed to obtain necessary subsurface data along the proposed alignment of the Elliott Bay seawall stabilization scheme. The following is provided for the geotechnical services that may be required for development of alternatives for the Elliott Bay seawall stabilization scheme.

 (a) Subsurface Exploration Plan - A subsurface exploration program shall be planned and conducted using exploratory borings, test pits, and in-situ tests to provide information relative to soil, groundwater, and other geologic conditions along the project alignment. Laboratory testing on soil samples obtained from the exploratory borings shall be performed to obtain engineering and index properties for use in the design of the Elliott Bay seawall stabilization scheme.

 (b) Soil Borings - Experienced contractors will be obtained to perform the field exploration and related activities. A licensed geologist will supervise field activities, log the borings, and classify and collect soil samples. Explorations will be accomplished for preliminary and final design of the proposed facilities.

 (c) Test Pit Excavations - Four test pit excavations may be accomplished along the Alaskan Way seawall in the vicinity of Pier 66.

 (d) Geotechnical Data Report - A geotechnical data report (GDR) will be prepared summarizing the field exploration and laboratory testing. The report will include all test results, logs of the borings and test pits, site maps showing exploration locations, and a discussion of the studies and results. The report will be submitted in draft format for review, and finalized after review comments are received and incorporated.

 4.7.2. Geotechnical Engineering Analyses

 Geotechnical engineering analyses may be performed to identify critical design elements and provide a basis for geotechnical recommendations. When necessary, geotechnical engineering design recommendations will be developed and provided for development of alternatives for the Elliott Bay seawall stabilization scheme. Results of studies will be summarized in interim submittals and provided to the PDT as they are developed. All of the studies will then be summarized and presented in a Geotechnical Engineering Report (GER).

 (a) Develop Subsurface Profiles -The results of the explorations will be incorporated into subsurface profiles. The profiles will be developed at selected locations both parallel and perpendicular to the alignment. Typical geologic cross sections will then be generalized for use in developing seawall design sections.

 (b) Evaluate Geologic Hazards - The results of the explorations shall be used to evaluate the geologic hazards along the project alignment. These include erosion, landsliding, surface fault rupture, and liquefaction. Additional analyses will be performed to further quantify the potential for liquefaction and lateral spreading.

 (c) Develop Seismic Design Criteria - Seismic design criteria will be developed for the project. It is anticipated that the results of site specific ground response analyses performed for another local project will be available for this task. Additional ground response analyses using the computer program ProShake may also be accomplished for selected portions of the seawall alignment based on the results of the subsurface exploration program.

 (d) Limit Equilibrium Studies - Typical geologic cross sections will be developed and limit equilibrium analyses will be performed to establish preliminary seawall study sections. Both static and seismic (pseudostatic methods) limit equilibrium analyses will be accomplished to develop preliminary geometries of the ground improvement for seawall stabilization. The results of these analyses will be used in the numerical studies that will be performed to refine the seawall stabilization schemes.

 (e) Three-Dimensional (3D) FLAC Analysis - To further evaluate the potential for reducing the volume of ground improvement used to stabilize the seawall, a 3D finite difference study shall be accomplished using the computer program FLAC. The FLAC analysis shall be focused on reducing the volume of ground improvement by considering various cell patterns rather than 100 percent coverage. The performance of the 3D structure under seismic loading conditions shall be evaluated using pseudo-static analysis methods. The FLAC analyses shall include the following subtasks: developing the model, calibrating the model, performing a series of parametric analyses, performing the pseudo-static analyses, and evaluating the results. Three typical subsurface profiles will be evaluated.

 (f) Two-Dimensional (2D) FLAC Analysis - Based on the results of the 3D analyses, a 2D dynamic analysis shall be performed to model the performance of potential cellular ground improvement structures. This analysis shall use equivalent properties estimated from the 3D studies. These equivalent properties shall be used to evaluate the seismic performance under the 100-year, 500-year, and 2,500-year ground motions. Three typical subsurface profiles will be evaluated. The FLAC analyses shall include the following subtasks: developing the model, calibrating the model, performing a series of parametric analyses, performing the dynamic analyses, and evaluating the results.

 (g) Temporary Construction Considerations - Geotechnical engineering recommendations may be developed for the design of temporary facilities and structures that may be required for construction of the permanent seawall structure. It is anticipated that recommendations may be developed for various cofferdam facilities, deep foundations required for bracing, and temporary excavation support schemes.

 (h) Dewatering Considerations - It is anticipated that temporary dewatering may be required for construction of the seawall stabilization scheme. Recommendations may be developed for dewatering including: appropriate dewatering methods, estimated flow volumes, water quality issues, and disposal considerations.

 (i) Soil and Groundwater Environmental Quality -The results of the environmental quality testing shall be summarized. Based on this effort, estimates of volumes, limits, and the nature of potential contaminated, and/or hazardous materials along the project corridor may be developed. Preliminary recommendations regarding treatment, disposal, and handling will be summarized in a technical memorandum.

 (j) Recommendations and Report - The results of the geotechnical studies will be summarized in a technical report. The report will be submitted in draft format for review, and finalized after review comments are received and incorporated.

 4.8 HAZARDOUS, TOXIC, AND RADIOLOGICAL WASTE (HTRW) STUDIES/REPORT

 Limited hazardous, toxic, and radiological waste (HTRW) studies are required to establish the nature and extent, if any, of HTRW contamination and develop the impact and cost of needed remedial action. Because the project area is recently accreted tidelands, there is presently no reason to believe that investigations beyond a Preliminary Assessment will be required. A site visit and literature review (initial screening), as well as sampling and testing in conjunction with the geotechnical explorations, will reveal the need for any further site investigations to satisfy HTRW requirements. The objective of HTRW studies is to identify and assess potential areas of HTRW contamination, including the effects on project lands, worker health and safety, and material disposal; develop alternatives for addressing HTRW contaminated materials; and develop regulatory compliance strategies. The Corps will perform all HTRW studies. Reference: ER 1165-2-132.

 4.9 SURVEYS AND MAPPING

 This task includes all surveying, aerial photography, mapping and related tasks necessary to support real estate, engineering, environmental and design studies. Both the Corps and the City will perform this work.

 4.9.1. Geographic Information System (GIS)

 Geographic Information System (GIS) technology will be used to manage the diverse geospatial data and information to be used to visualize, evaluate and document alternatives. Tasks include identifying and compiling existing environmental, economic, real estate and infrastructure data; creating additional data layers and corresponding metadata; and preparing maps for public meetings, feasibility report and environmental documentation.

 4.9.2. Survey Base Mapping

 A high precision topographic base map will be prepared for engineering design of the seawall stabilization. The base map will be developed based upon ground field survey techniques. The base mapping will adhere to national mapping standards, although the intent of the survey is to produce an "any given point positional tolerance" result within 0.12 feet horizontally and vertically. The west edge of the new base map is anticipated to be for the most part the outside face of the seawall along Alaskan Way from approximately King Street to Bay Street. The east edge of the new base map will include Alaskan Way but may extend east of the original shoreline of Elliot Bay. As the details of the project become better defined, the area of the survey may be extended in order to include areas that may be affected directly or indirectly by the construction of the project. The new base map will be added to the existing bathymetric survey data, which extends out into Elliott Bay. The base mapping shall consist of the following activities.

 (a) Field Survey. Field survey topographic mapping will be conducted which will delineate all surface and above ground improvements and utilities situated within the project area, and spot elevations sufficient to establish 1 foot contour intervals for those areas situated within the Seattle Tidelands plat, 1 foot contour intervals on other relatively flat areas and 2 foot contour intervals on steep slope areas. Data will be gathered using a combination of traditional ground survey methods and 3D scanning.

 (b) Initial Base Map Preparation. Once the data is collected and compiled by a "least squares" adjustment program, x, y and z coordinate values for each data point collected will be obtained. A digital terrain model (DTM) of said points will be generated which will generate the contours as referenced above. Line work connecting common data points will be performed manually within the DTM. For a horizontal features check, line work generated by the new DTM will be cross-checked against the existing aerial mapping for inconsistencies.

 (c) Base Mapping Updates. It is possible that additional and/or supplemental survey points will be accumulated after the time of completion of the base mapping described above. It is possible that these new points would supersede areas within said base mapping. Accordingly, the base map will be continuously upgraded to reflect the supplemental survey data. Supplementary site specific data collection and mapping could include, but is not limited to, horizontal and vertical positioning of geotechnical potholing, column foundations, hazardous waste areas, subsurface seawall structure, viaduct bridge as built, face of adjoining buildings, mapping on adjoining private lands, building foundations, improvement changes within street right of way occurring after the initial mapping is completed, and detour areas beyond mapping limits described above.

 4.9.3. Utility and Drainage Mapping

 Utility Mapping for the non-gravity, gravity, and aerial utilities in the corridor, including but not limited to water, natural gas, petroleum and fuel oil, steam, telephone, fiber optics, cable television, electrical, traffic signals and parking meters, railroad communications, storm, sanitary, and combined sewers shall be prepared in accordance with applicable sections of CI/ASCE 38-02, "Standard Guideline for the Collection and Depiction of Existing Subsurface Utility Data" and the prevailing standard of care. This task does not include future utility relocation design or the analysis of the need for such design. The utility mapping shall cover the same defined project area as described in paragraph 4.2.2 for the initial base map and may be expanded as required to support the continued development of the project's design. The City will provide this work task at no cost to the project. This task will not count toward the City's work- in-kind contribution.

 4.10 ENGINEERING AND DESIGN ANALYSIS REPORT

 The engineering objectives during the feasibility study are detailed in ER 1110-2-1150, Engineering and Design for Civil Works Projects. The primary engineering objective during the feasibility phase is to provide engineering data and analyses sufficient to develop the complete project schedule and cost estimate. The objectives also include plan formulation support and support for evaluation of alternatives. The local sponsor effort prior to the Corps feasibility study included plan formulation and evaluation of alternatives, with engineering support for that effort. The feasibility study team will review the prior work and evaluate whether reformulation will be required. Reformulation, and engineering support for that is not scoped, and will be scoped if needed. See ER 1110-2-1150 for additional details on engineering objectives.

 4.10.1. Engineering Management/Administration

 The management of the engineering effort includes, but is not limited to, scoping work, scheduling work, verifying that work meets scope requirement, managing design budget, contract management, scheduling and facilitating progress and coordination meetings, and coordination of effort between multiple engineering agencies.

 4.10.2. Design Development of Preferred Seawall Stabilization Plan

 Sufficient engineering and design will be performed in the feasibility phase to enable refinement of the features of the preferred plan, prepare the baseline cost estimates, develop a design and construction schedule, and allow detailed design on the selected plan to begin immediately following receipt of PED funds. The specific design subtasks required will depend, to a degree, on the preferred plan. Based upon the current understanding of the project, the subtasks listed below are likely to be required but may be modified to suit the needs of the preferred plan. Reference: ER 1110-2-1150, ER 1105-2- 1407.

 4.10.2.1. Engineering

 Preliminary engineering will be provided to confirm the preferred method for stabilization of the seawall from approximately King Street to Bay Street. The following are the key work elements necessary to accomplish the following objective:

 (a) Evaluate Ground Improvement Methods - Evaluate the preferred seawall stabilization concept by studying alternatives for accomplishing the ground improvement that is currently envisioned as the method of stabilizing the seawall. This will be a study of construction methods so that the scope of potential environmental impacts can be understood and mitigated in a cost-effective manner. It is anticipated that this evaluation may include a test section as part of the geotechnical exploration program.

 4.10.2.2. Construction Phasing and Maintenance Of Traffic

 The anticipated method of stabilizing the seawall will disrupt traffic and require demolition to major portions of the Alaskan Way Street. A preliminary maintenance of traffic plan is required to assess temporary impacts to traffic and businesses during construction. Also, the preliminary traffic plan will have a significant impact on the construction cost estimate and schedule. This task will require close coordination with the structural engineering of the seawall stabilization as described above.

 (a) Determine Objectives and Constraints - Phasing construction activities depend on the circumstances of the project and the objectives of the authorities carrying it out. Better decisions result when the underlying assumptions and objective priorities are explicitly identified in advance. This sub-task will result in identifying assumptions and establishing objectives that will drive the decisions for traffic maintenance, construction phasing and contract packaging. The following subtasks shall be performed:

 * Clarify Assumptions: Through discussions with client agencies and EIS feedback and analysis, establish key factors such as funding flow, start date and third party concerns.

 * Identify Constraints: Through discussions with client agencies and stakeholders identify constraints on construction contractor performance such as daily and annual work restrictions, noise limits and traffic throughput and access requirements.

 * List Project Objectives: In coordination with stakeholders, compile list of project goals and objectives likely to be impacted by construction phasing and contract packaging.

 * Prioritize Project Objectives: Rank the objectives to guide construction planning.

 (b) Plan Construction Phasing and Traffic Management The project area is an urban street, a utility corridor, embarkation point for ferries and cruise ships, tourist attraction, access to waterfront businesses and littoral. Construction activities may overlap with replacement, removal, repair or stabilization of the adjacent Alaskan Way Viaduct, renovation of the Washington Ferry System Coleman Terminal or construction of the Olympic Sculpture Park. The construction phasing plan will describe in detail the sequence and interfaces of component activities, taking into account traffic maintenance requirements, utility relocation planning and the assumptions, constraints and prioritized objectives as described above. The following subtasks shall be performed:

 * Determine Activity Sequence: Establish the optimum sequence of performing construction tasks.

 * Estimate Activity Durations: Determine a range for the duration of each activity.

 * Analyze Activity Interfaces: Examine how activities will intersect and interfere with each other. Establish precedence relationships.

 * Develop Network Schedule for Construction: On Primavera or other approved medium, schedule the construction activities.

 4.10.2.3. Utility Design and Relocation Plan

 Preliminary design required for the relocation of electrical, water, combined and sanitary sewer, storm drain, natural gas, petroleum and fuel oil, steam, telephone, cable television, and fiber optic utility facilities for the Seawall Stabilization shall be prepared at approximately a 35% design level or as required to determine the cost of maintaining utilities during construction and/or relocating them. Design required for relocation of electrical utility facilities shall be completed under subtask 4.3.3(F). Mainline and major service connection relocation requirements, both overhead and underground, will be identified to support design of the Seawall Stabilization project and development of an opinion of cost. The preliminary planning for relocation of utilities shall address (1) New services to meet the requirements of the Seawall Stabilization facilities and temporary construction facilities; (2) Permanent relocations of the existing utility systems within the project area, and (3) Temporary relocations as may be required to accommodate staged construction of the Seawall Stabilization project. If required storm water report may be prepared to assist in defining the final configuration of storm water treatment within the project area. The City will provide this work task at no cost to the project. This task will not count toward the City's work-in-kind contribution.

 4.10.2.4. Surface Restoration For Seawall Stabilization

 After seawall stabilization work the project surface should be restored consistent with development objectives for the Elliott Bay waterfront area. The purpose of this task is to provide technical support to City and stakeholder planning efforts and then prepare plans in sufficient detail to allow costs to be more accurately established.

 4.10.3. Value Engineering Study

 Conduct value engineering study for Seattle seawall project using OVEST CX study team. OVEST will provide a 5 person team consisting of geotechnical, civil, structural, and interdisciplinary engineers and environmental specialist.

 The study team will follow the 5 step VE job plan: information gathering, speculation, analysis, development, and presentation phases. The sponsoring District will provide representatives of the design team to assist in the information, speculation and analysis phases of the study.

 4.10.4. Prepare Engineering and Design Appendix.

 The engineering appendix will document the engineering and design effort during project formulation, and will include the design data analyses, a detailed description of the design features of the recommended plan, summary of alternative measures and plans evaluated, drawings, and construction cost estimates.

 4.11 COST ESTIMATES

 This task includes review of existing cost estimates necessary to evaluate alternative plans, and preparation of a detailed baseline cost estimate for the recommended plan to be used for project authorization, development and completion. Cost estimates for the recommended plan and National Economic Development (NED) plan, if different, will be prepared for the final feasibility report using the Corps' MCACES software. The estimates will include all Corps of Engineers and non-Federal costs for lands and damages, all construction features, relocation of facilities and utilities, mitigation, HTRW concerns, planning, engineering and design, and supervision and administration, along with the appropriate contingencies and escalation associated with each of these activities through project completion. The final product will be a reliable, accurate cost estimate that defines the non-Federal sponsor's obligations and supports project authorization within established statutory limits. The Corps will review the City's cost estimates for alternative plans and the recommended plan, and will assist the City in preparing the cost estimate for the recommended plan in MCACES. Reference: ER 1110-2-1150 and ER 1110-2-1302.

 4.12 PLAN FORMULATION AND EVALUATION

 This task includes the iterative process of evaluation of alternative plans and selection of the recommended plan, and includes activities that are not directly associated with other study tasks. Plan formulation is the process whereby project alternatives, including the existing and future without and with-project condition, are evaluated. Alternative plans, beginning with those that have already been developed by the City, will be formulated in consideration of four criteria: completeness, effectiveness, efficiency, and acceptability. As formulation progresses, alternatives will be considered in increasing level of detail and the number of alternative plans will decrease in number, until a recommended plan is selected and a detailed evaluation is completed. The formulation process will analyze all available information and data assembled from many different components of the study. The Corps and the Sponsor will jointly conduct plan formulation. Reference: ER 1105-2-100.

 4.12.1. Review of work completed prior to this study

 This task includes engineering, environmental, and planning review of work completed by the AWVSR Team prior to the City and Corps signing the FCSA. Significant prior work includes alternatives formulation and screening, plan formulation, and environmental coordination including a draft EIS. The review is to verify that prior work, including alternatives formulation and screening, conforms to Corps standards. This task will review and identify any constraints within the City's planning process that are inconsistent with the Corps planning process, which may result in the need for additional formulation and the LPP varying from the NED plan. Specifically, the Corps will review work associated with the non-structural alternative to evaluate the continued work necessary in the feasibility study. Any identified gaps will provide the basis for a verification/revision of the PMP in conjunction with the Feasibility Scoping Meeting.

 4.12.2. Without Project Conditions Report and review

 Selection of the NED plan is based on comparison of alternatives to the future without project condition. An accurate determination of the future without project condition is essential to successful completion of the planning process. This task includes the necessary PDT coordination to determine the without project condition, prepare a report describing that condition in detail and the Independent Technical Review of that product.. The economic analysis of the without project condition failure scenarios is included in the economics scope. This separate scope item for this is intended to demonstrate emphasis for the report and review.

 4.12.3. Plan formulation and evaluation

 Beginning with the City's work completed prior to this study, alternatives will be formulated, screened and evaluated to determine the recommended plan. This scope anticipates that the City's process considered an appropriate range of alternatives and correctly screened and evaluated them to result in the City's selection of the ground improvement alternative. A non-structural alternative must be included in this alternatives analysis. If the team determines that there are additional alternatives to consider, or that the City's planning process screened out viable alternatives, then the work associated with evaluating additional alternatives will be scoped and performed. This may ultimately result in a LPP differing from the NED plan. This task included preparation of an alternatives formulation memorandum, which will serve as the basis of the Alternatives Formulation Briefing.

 4.12.4. Feasibility Scoping Meeting (FSM)

 To ensure that the study is focused on the specific objectives of the project, a FSM will be convened early in the study. The FSM will be held after the without project conditions memo has been reviewed. The FSM will bring the HQ, Division and District staffs, the City, and resource agencies together to focus the study, to further define the depth of analysis required, and to refine the study constraints. A possible outcome of the FSM is a need to update the PMP.

 4.12.5. Alternatives formulation briefing (AFB)

 The alternative review process was established to save time and costs in the preparation and review of feasibility reports, and to facilitate HQUSACE participation in plan formulation. The AFB will be scheduled when the District has identified a selected plan and is prepared to present the formulation and evaluation of alternatives. The Washington level participants will seek to confirm that the plan formulation and selection process, the identified preferred plan, and definition of Corps of Engineers and non-Federal responsibilities conform to current policy guidance. The goal is to identify and resolve any policy concerns that would otherwise delay or preclude approval of the draft report.

 4.13 FEASIBILITY REPORT DOCUMENTATION

 4.13.1. Draft Report Preparation

 This task includes all activities specifically pertaining to producing the draft feasibility report for public review. Activities include writing the draft report, editing and revision following independent technical review, and distributing the draft feasibility report for public review. Reference: ER 1105-2-100.

 4.13.2. Draft Feasibility Report Independent Technical Review

 This task includes costs for technical review of the draft feasibility report by the Independent Technical Review Team. Qualified individuals who are independent of the technical production of the feasibility report will conduct technical review of the draft report. The review will verify that the recommended plan (1) satisfies engineering and functional criteria; (2) meets the customers needs consistent with law and existing public policy, (3) has correct design assumptions and calculations; and (4) has a sufficient level of engineering to substantiate both the screening level comparative cost estimates and the baseline cost estimate with contingencies to support selection of the recommended plan. Members of the review team may include Seattle District and sponsor's personnel. The study will also have extensive review during the plan formulation process, and the draft report and SEIS will undergo a rigorous public review following the independent technical review. See also Section 7 below for additional discussion pertaining to quality control.

 4.13.3. Final Report Preparation

 This task includes all activities specifically pertaining to producing the final feasibility report. Specific activities include responding to review comments, preparing the final documents, and transmitting them for processing by the Northwestern Division Engineer. Reference: ER 1105-2-100.

 4.14 PROJECT MANAGEMENT PLAN

 This task includes all activities required to maintaining the accuracy and relevance of the Project Management Plan throughout the feasibility study.

 4.14.1. PMP development and update

 The initial PMP was prepared based on assumptions about the work already accomplished and, therefore, assumptions have been made about what work remains. Since the budget for preparing the PMP was not sufficient for a complete review of the work already accomplished, and that review may change some of the assumptions built into this plan, the team will review the PMP after reviewing the prior work and make changes as needed.

 Additionally, the PMP validation task includes development of certain sections of the PMP that require additional coordination and analysis with the sponsor and coordinating AWVSR Team. This task will specifically include further definition of the roles, responsibilities and organizational and financial structure of the Corps and AWVSR teampartnership, defining the conditions necessary for in-kind work to be creditable and fully addressing the technical review process for consultant work. Furthermore, defining the long-term maintenance of the study, through this PMP would include defining the conditions under which the PMP or the FCSA would be amended.

 4.14.2. Maintenance of PMP

 The initial PMP was prepared based on the team's capability to perform work, rather than on the anticipated funding availability. As the budget situation for each year becomes known, the PMP will be updated to reflect a more accurate budget and schedule.

 4.15 FEASIBILITY STUDY MANAGEMENT

 This task will include all activities related to the overall management of the feasibility phase.

 4.15.1 Program management

 Program management consists of feasibility phase Corps of Engineers budget development, management, defense and execution, as well as funds allocation and monitoring of both Corps of Engineers and non- Federal expenditures. It includes preparation of budgetary documents and upward reporting; programming of funding, managing and tracking study obligations and expenditures, and accounting for Sponsor in-kind services.

 4.15.2 Project management

 Project management includes a wide variety of tasks and activities. These include overall coordination with local, state, tribal and Federal governmental agencies, interest groups, and the general public; oversight management of Corps, Sponsor, and contracted study tasks and related activities; coordination between the Corps and the Sponsor; attending and conducting meetings and briefings throughout the course of the study; responding to congressional and other inquiries; upward reporting and responses to data calls; maintenance of data in automated management systems such as P2; and oversight management of the review of the draft and final feasibility report/SEIS or other documents. Both the Corps and the Sponsor will perform project management activities. This task does not include plan formulation, report preparation, or Washington level review support that are separately accounted for. Reference: ER 5-1-11, ER 1105-2-100.

 4.15.3 Executive Committee

 This task includes costs incurred by the study Executive Committee members who will generally oversee study progress in accordance with the PMP, as prescribed in Article IV of the FCSA. The Executive Committee will meet periodically throughout the feasibility phase.

 4.15.4 Preconstruction Engineering and Design Cost Sharing Agreement

 A preconstruction engineering and design (PED) cost sharing agreement is prepared during the feasibility phase, following completion and submittal of the final feasibility report. The PED phase of project development encompasses all planning and engineering necessary for project construction. It also outlines the division of design responsibilities between the Corps and the Sponsor. This task includes scoping, scheduling and budgeting the PED phase, and preparing the PED phase PMP.

 4.16 INITIAL PROJECT COOPERATION AGREEMENT

 This task includes reviewing the model project cooperation agreement (PCA) with the Sponsor and agreeing on a final draft PCA to be included in the final feasibility report. The PCA describes all of the requirements and responsibilities relating to construction of the project, including items of local cooperation required from the local sponsor. Reference Section 221 of Flood Control Act of 1970 (PL 91- 611), as amended by Sections 101(e) and 103(j) of the 1986 Water Resources Development Act (PL 99-662), as amended.

 4.17 WASHINGTON LEVEL REPORT APPROVAL

 This task includes those activities typically necessary for the Seattle District and the Sponsor to support the Washington level review process of the feasibility report. This includes the period from the signing of the final report by the Seattle District Engineer, and ending when the Assistant Secretary of the Army (Civil Works) submits the feasibility report to the Office of Management and Budget for review for consistency with the policies and programs of the President. These items could include answering comments, attending Washington level meetings and other necessary travel, and making minor report revisions as a result of Washington level review. This item is required to be estimated at five (5) percent of the total study cost or $50,000, whichever is less, and will be shared equally. Because the amount of work that will be required during this review period cannot be predetermined, this work item is considered a contingency, to be used only as necessary. Any costs relating to the feasibility report that are incurred following completion of the feasibility phase and subsequent termination of the FCSA will be 100 percent Corps of Engineers costs. Reference: ER 1105-2-100 (Chapter 8), EC 1105-2- 208.

 SECTION 5 - FUNDING

 5.1 COST-SHARING

 The feasibility study is cost shared by the Corps of Engineers and the City of Seattle according to the terms in the Feasibility Cost Sharing Agreement. The total study cost is shared 50/50. The City can provide up to their full requirement in Work-in-Kind. The City will provide cash for any cost-sharing requirement that the City does not fulfill with work-in-kind.

 The fully-funded estimated total study cost is $9,517,698. The local sponsor 50% share is $4,758,849, of which the sponsor will contribute $4,758,849, the full amount, as work-in-kind. The City will provide documentation of their work-in-kind contribution quarterly.

 Work in-kind will be credited to match available Corps of Engineers funds. The sponsor understands that any work performed in excess of the Corps of Engineers funding may not be creditable to the sponsor's cost share, but will reduce the total project cost. All work-in-kind products will receive technical review consistent with the Federal Independent Technical Review requirements and must be acceptable to the Corps. Work-in-kind must be specifically detailed in the PMP, although the PMP may be modified to accommodate changes to the planned work.

 Further detail of treatment of work-in-kind products will be negotiated and documented in this PMP during the initial stages of feasibility.

 5.2 DETAILED COST ESTIMATE

 Table 5 summarizes the estimate of Government cost share and Sponsor cost share (cash contribution and in-kind services) for each Government fiscal year (FY) of the study. Offices of Management and Budget (OMB) inflation factors have been applied to FY 2005, 2006, and 2007 estimates. The fully funded total study cost estimate is shown at the bottom of Table 5, followed by the Government and Sponsor cost share for each year of the study period. Detailed study cost estimates for individual study tasks have been assembled in an Attachment to the PMP. The detailed estimates will be used by the Project Manager in issuing Work Requests during the course of the feasibility phase.

 ..TX: SECTION 7 - QUALITY CONTROL PLAN

 7.1 PURPOSE

 This Quality Control (QC) Plan presents the process that assures quality products. This QC Plan defines the responsibilities and roles of each member on the Project Delivery Team (PDT) and Independent Technical Review (ITR) Team. The products to be reviewed by the ITR Team are the feasibility report, environmental documentation, and associated technical appendixes. Corps policy is to develop, integrate and implement quality control and quality assurance as a part of the Corps' Project Management Business Process (PMBP). The PDT will ensure that services and products meet the agreed upon requirements and are performed in accordance with appropriate laws, policies and technical criteria. The QC Plan defines the responsibilities and roles of each member of the PDT and ITR team. ITR will be performed independent of the technical production of the product to be reviewed. It will include all relevant technical disciplines, along with necessary legal sufficiency and policy compliance review. Refer to NWSOM 5-1-3, dated February 25, 2002, as amended, for a complete description of quality management policy and responsibilities established by Seattle District.

 Reference: ER 5-1-11, U.S. Army Corps of Engineers Business Process; ER 1110-1-12, Engineering and Design Quality Management; ER 1110-1- 8159, Design and Review Checking System, DrChecks; NWSOM 5-1-3, Quality Management Plan, Seattle District; Northwestern Division Quality Management Plan.

 7.2 METHODOLOGY

 7.2.1 Technical Coordination

 Generally, product development shall be performed in accordance with established criteria and guidance and with established policy. Meetings with the appropriate review team members during the planning process will be held at key decision points. Meetings will also be held to discuss and resolve technical and/or policy issues that may arise during the course of product development. Technical issues and concerns raised during the technical review process will be documented, as will the resolution of these issues and concerns.

 7.2.2 Product Quality Control

 Product Quality Control is the independent technical review (ITR) of a completed product. The Corps Project Manager will provide completed documents to the review team leader who will distribute them to the review team members for review. During the review, review team meetings will be scheduled as required to ensure that all components have been coordinated, there is consistency throughout the document, and there is a consensus on proposed revisions. Any issues on which a review team position cannot be reached will be referred through the project manager to the Seattle District Functional Chief for resolution. The review team will record comments in Dr Checks for appropriate action by the Project Delivery Team. The review team leader and project manager will take comments that cannot be resolved between reviewers and study team to the appropriate Functional Chief for final disposition; the assistance of North Pacific Division and HQUSACE will be requested as needed.

 7.2.1. Consultant Products

 Consultants are an extension of the Corps or Sponsor staff. Accordingly, any designs, reports, etc. prepared by consultants will have an independent review by the review team just as if they had been prepared by the PDT.

 7.2.2. Policy Review

 Questions or problems regarding policy concerns will be elevated by Seattle District to HQUSACE (CECW-A) for resolution, as the issues develop. Legal and real estate policy issues will be elevated to the Chief Counsel and Director of Real Estate, respectively.

 7.3 QUALITY CONTROL RESPONSIBILITIES

 7.3.1. General

 Technical review team continuity will be maintained through the life of the project, to the maximum extent possible. The size and composition of the review team shall be based on the complexity of the project; this composition may change as the project progresses and specific project features are better defined. The review team leader will normally be a Corps of Engineers project manager.

 7.3.2. Project Manager

 The feasibility study project manager shall be responsible for coordinating the review effort with the review team leader and shall:

 * ensure that the schedule contains sufficient time to perform reviews of completed products;

 * ensure that the team leader is notified of significant study team meetings and review conferences so that he/she can assemble the review team for in-progress reviews; and

 * manage responses to review memorandums and resolve technical issues with the review team leader, consult with North Western Division as appropriate, and forward all unresolved technical issues to the appropriate Functional Chief for resolution.

 7.3.3. Resource Managers

 Each Corps of Engineers Resource Manager is responsible for ensuring that all work prepared by or for his/her Section or Branch has received any necessary internal quality control checks prior to the feasibility report being furnished to the review team for review.

 7.3.4. Independent Technical Review Team Leader

 The review team leader is responsible for coordinating all activities associated with the independent technical review of the draft feasibility report and EIS, and will:

 * Attend all major plan formulation meetings.

 * Coordinate the technical review and assemble all technical review comments and other review related correspondence for the use by the review team and Project Delivery Team.

 7.3.5. Independent Technical Review Team Members

 Each review team member is responsible for performing an independent technical review of the draft feasibility report and environmental impact document or portion thereof. The ITR Team members are listed in Table 2.

 7.4 TECHNICAL REVIEW DOCUMENTATION

 7.6.1 All significant review comments will be provided to the Project Delivery Team in Dr Checks. The Project Manager will assure that all significant comments are resolved and their final disposition is identified within Dr Checks and back-checks are completed by each reviewer.

 7.6.2 The feasibility report submitted to higher authority shall be accompanied by technical review documentation. This documentation shall be a separate item not to be included as part of the feasibility report. A page indicating the names of the Project Delivery Team members and technical review team members shall be included.

 7.5 PRODUCTS TO REVIEW

 7.7.1 The ITR team will review, at a minimum, these products of the Feasibility Study:

 * Without Project Conditions Report

 * Alternatives formulation

 * Environmental Documentation

 * Feasibility Report

 SECTION 1 -

 SECTION 8 - ACQUISITION PLAN

 8.1 OVERVIEW

 The project team will prepare detailed acquisition plans during the course of the project, as specific acquisition needs are identified. In general, the Corps will accomplish its work tasks other than engineering with Corps personnel. The Corps will accomplish engineering work, other than review, through private sector consulting services. If the workload of the non-engineering tasks exceeds the capability of the Seattle District, the project manager will attempt to obtain resources at other Corps districts. If other districts are unable to accept the work, the project team will use private sector consulting services to complete the work.

 SECTION 9 - RISK MANAGEMENT

 9.1 OVERVIEW

 Risk management is a systematic process of identifying, analyzing, and responding to risk for the entire project life cycle. A risk analysis is performed for five categories of project risk: scope, quality, schedule, cost, and safety and health risks. The level of detail of the risk analysis and plan is based on the complexity of the project. When a project is determined to be other than low-risk, the risk must be identified, and associated control procedures defined to address the risk.

 Within the scope of this PMP, a review of study progress and any needed scope changes will be completed prior to initiating the next phase. Specific risks and associated control features will be identified with respect to scope, quality, schedule and cost at the initiation of each phase. A risk analysis will be completed at the initiation of feasibility phase.

 SECTION 10 - SAFETY and OCCUPATIONAL HEALTH HAZARD ANALYSIS AND MONITORING

 This section will be developed with further design development and construction management planning. This section will be of great import in subsequent site analysis, design development and construction management planning, so it will be developed early in feasibility phase. Also, the potential project site will undergo HTRW screening.

 SECTION 11 - CHANGE MANAGEMENT

 11.1 OVERVIEW

 Study progress will be monitored and reviewed as the study progresses. This PMP incorporates assumptions and predictions concerning the possible outcome of these studies in order to provide a reasonable scope of work, estimate of cost, and duration of the individual study activities. As this study progress, these assumptions and predictions will be reevaluated to determine if the actual outcome of a study segment matches the assumed outcome. This reevaluation will be done continuously as the study progresses. Formal evaluation of changed conditions and assumptions will occur at the conclusion of the work described in the PMP, prior to proceeding to the next stage of project development. The Corps and City of Seattle will confer and revisit the scope or work, cost and shared funding commitments as study tasks are completed, and prior to initiating the next stage of the study. These reviews will provide an opportunity to revise the set of assumed outcomes, the scope of work, cost, and shared funding commitments, to accommodate these changes and ensure a favorable outcome.

 Once an original PMP has been developed and accepted by the PDT (an acknowledgement by email of acceptance or formal signing), changes to the scope, schedule, or budget shall be communicated and agreed upon among all PDT members. Should conflicts occur, the PM shall facilitate resolution in a timely manner. Changes to scope, schedule, or budget shall be communicated to Executive Committee immediately.

 11.2 CONFLICT RESOLUTION MANAGEMENT:

 If and when the project delivery team (PDT) cannot resolve an issue on a timely basis (within one meeting cycle or no longer than one month), it is the responsibility of the project manager to refer the issue or conflict to the Executive Committee as identified within Table 2 of the PMP. The following are the basic guidelines for conflict resolution management within the PDT:

 a. Clarify each team member's role and responsibility with the team as defined in Table 2 of the PMP.

 b. Not all team members are decision makers, one spokesperson per discipline/organization will be on the Executive Committee .

 c. Each team member is encouraged to bring his/her idea to the table; however, when a team member raises an issue, he or she must explain how this issue will impact:

 - Scope

 - Budget

 - Schedule

 - His/her organization's mission or the quality of the product

 d. The PM will facilitate conflict resolution within the PDT. Each team member will have at least 5 minutes to state his or her opinion based on his/her interest and area of expertise on the issue or conflict at hand. The PDT member raising an issue or that has conflict with a decision will start the discussions and must explain how the issue can be resolved with them. When each member has had the opportunity to comment, the team will discuss and vote on the issue. Unanimous agreement is desired but not required to reach a consensus. Every attempt should be made to satisfy all team members' concern with the issue in this process. The team members will vote on the decision/resolution based on the following:

 1. I can say an unqualified "yes" to the proposed decision or resolution. I am satisfied that the resolution is an expression of wisdom of the group.

 2. I find the proposed decision/resolution perfectly acceptable.

 3. I can live with the proposed decision/resolution, although I am not especially enthusiastic about it.

 4. I do not fully agree with the proposed decision/resolution and need to register my view about it. However, I do not choose to block the decision/resolution. I am willing to trust the wisdom of the group.

 5. I do not agree with the decision/resolution and feel the need to stand in the way of acceptance.

 6. I feel we have no clear sense of unity in the Team. We need to do more work before consensus can be reached

 e. A consensus is reached when no team member voted 5 or 6. Once the team reaches a consensus, all team members are expected to abide by the resolution (i.e., same issue cannot be raised twice without any new information).

 f. In the event that the PDT is not successful resolving the conflict, the project manager must raise the issue to Executive Committee based on the following dissenting vote(s):

 - 1 or more team member(s) voted 6.

 g. The Executive Committee will examine the issue or conflict, and evaluate the overall impact on scope, budget, and schedule, and making a determination of solution of the issue.

 h. It is understood that once the Executive Committee reaches a consensus, the PDT will abide by the resolution recommended by the Core Management Team.

 i. If the Executive Committee is not successful in resolving the issue or reaching a recommendation, they will elevate the issue to the next level of management until the issue is resolved or a decision can be made.

 SECTION 12 - COMMUNICATIONS STRATEGY

 12.1 OVERVIEW

 PDT meetings will be held as needed to discuss study schedule, work requirements, and findings. In addition, the PM will update the PDT with email and frequent phone contacts. All significant meetings/emails/phone calls will be documented with memos and/or shared by email with the PDT. The PDT will be encouraged to hold open, frank discussions with the PM, sponsor, and other members. Communication will be courteous, informal, and frequent. The Technical Review Team will be involved throughout the study process as key decisions are made, not only at the end of the study.

 The primary contact with resource agencies and groups will be through the Environmental Coordinator as part of the environmental scoping process for the study. In addition, resource agencies will be notified of key study findings/changes, and their input will be requested on both a formal and informal level.

 The sponsor will be invited to all pertinent meetings and will share in emails and memos. Communication will be frequent and informal, supported by letters and formal communication as needed. The sponsor will provide the key avenue to contacting stakeholders throughout the study. The sponsor will also have high visibility in all general public involvement.

 12.2 CONCEPTS

 * Internal communication among Alaskan Way Viaduct and Elliott Bay Seawall teams is critical to a consistent message.

 * Any external communication by seawall team should neither duplicate nor contradict viaduct team's communication efforts.

 * Any existing viaduct team communication tools (leadership and agency groups, web pages, mailing lists) should be used by the seawall team if at all possible - to save everyone money.

 * Any public outreach by seawall team should be scheduled in regard to viaduct outreach schedule.

 * Any public outreach by viaduct team should be communicated to seawall team and any seawall tools or messages confirmed with seawall team.

 * Any public outreach by seawall team should be communicated to viaduct team and any viaduct tools or messages confirmed with viaduct team.

 * Agencies should continue to speak on what they know and refer inquiries on other agencies' business to those other agencies.

 * The City of Seattle is the sponsor of the seawall project, and communication done by the Corps will be done in coordination with the City.

 12.3 KEY MESSAGES

 * The seawall study moves the city another step closer to a solution for a safe waterfront.

 * With an in-depth look at seawall construction designs, the City and Corps can make the best choice for the city and our environment.

 * Public involvement in evaluating seawall project alternatives will help the City and the Corps to find the best solution.

 * Seattle and the Corps are working to protect waterfront businesses and transportation.

 12.4 AUDIENCES

 * Business-chamber, businesses along waterfront and below viaduct, S. Seattle businesses, tourism industry, Seahawks, Mariners

 * Transportation-Burlington Northern Santa Fe Railroad, Union Pacific Railroad, Metro, Port, Bicyclists, pedestrians

 * Environment-Non-Governmental Organizations, agencies

 * Downtown residents, homeless advocates,

 * Commuters-Ballard, Fremont, Greenwood, Shoreline, West Seattle

 * Elected officials-city and federal primarily

 * Viaduct team-Department Of Transportation, Federal Highways Administration, SeaTrans

 * General public-Interested residents, casual observers

 SECTION 13 - VALUE MANAGEMENT

 13.1 OVERVIEW

 Value Engineering (VE) studies will be conducted early in the feasibility study during the design development phase, concurrent to the review of existing alternatives formulation. The goal of these VE studies will be to identify opportunities to increase the overall value of the project, by identifying opportunities for cost savings or for enhancements. Also, in the process of technical review, the review team members may identify additional opportunities to increase the overall value.

 SECTION 14 - CLOSE OUT PLAN

 14.1 OVERVIEW

 Throughout the project, expenditures will be monitored by the Corps in CEFMS to ensure Corps of Engineers/non-federal contributions and expenditures are in balance. Also, in-kind contributions from the local sponsor will be monitored and in-kind approvals by the project manager will be submitted to the Chief of F&A on a quarterly basis. In addition, accounts in CEFMS will be de-obligated as needed as the project progresses. This will ensure a timely and smooth closeout procedure for the project. As a part of the process of closing out a phase of a project, a lessons-learned report will be completed in Dr. Checks to provide a resource for future project planning.

 SECTION 15 - APPROVALS

 15.1 OVERVIEW

 The approval activity is performed whenever the PMP is expanded or revised, and has been endorsed by the PDT. The PMP will be approved by the Program Manager. PMP revisions which require approval include changes in project scope (which may require different skills), changes in execution schedule (when people are required), and changes in the level of effort required. This activity formalizes commitment from District Resource Providers to support the resource requirements contained in the approved plan.

 Team members from Real Estate, Environmental Resources Section, Civil Design, Cost Engineering, HTRW, Geotechnical Engineering, Value Engineering and Economics were all involved in the development of the PMP. Other offices were coordinated with on review of deliverables. With the approval of the PMP by the GI program manager, this PMP will be posted on District e-news, and can be used as a basis for entering the study into P2.

 MEMORANDUM FOR THE RECORD

 NWS-PM-PL

 FROM: Michael Green

 Regional Economist

 RE: Elliott Bay Seawall, Project Management Plan / Economics

 Economics and Social Analysis

 The economic data prepared during the reconnaissance 905(b) study will be used to its full extent when such data is consistent with feasibility phase requirements. Studies will be conducted pursuant to Appendix D "Economic and Social Considerations", of ER 1105-2-100. The base conditions in the study area must be well documented and readily understood. This area includes all of the Elliott Bay Seawall and the surrounding area which is affected by the Seawall. The feasibility phase analyses require the development of project area specific baseline information, including transportation and recreation values in the study area.

 1. Without Project Conditions -

 a. Literature Search - A literature search of research into the changes, updates, and currently accepted methodologies for quantifying seawall damage categories. No attempt will be made to produce benefit- cost ratios based on any alternative methodologies. The literature search will explore the applicability of methodologies that is consistent and relevant to the study scope.

 Estimated time: 120 hours at $88/hour = $10,560

 b. Define study area - Collect maps and real estate data. Working with the study team members will define the study area, locate area maps and assemble current and up-to-date assessor real estate parcel maps.

 Estimated time: 40 hours at $88/hour = $3,520

 c. Structure Inventory - Collect, assemble and refine real estate data. Establish an inventory of all structures in the study area and conduct a field survey. Retrieve study area parcel specific data to include in a structure inventory. During a field survey additional data will be collected on individual structures such as - first floor elevation, type and quality of structure.

 Estimated time: 240 hours at $88/hour = $21,120

 d. Major Rehabilitation Without Project Evaluation - The without project condition establishes the basis from which all other plans will be measured against. The without project condition assumes that the seawall will continue to function in the most efficient manner possible without the purposed rehabilitation. Extensive coordination between project study team members will be required to develop an event tree of probable failure scenarios expected to occur throughout the duration of the study period. Based upon the current physical condition of the Seawall, probabilities will be assigned to single or a combination of events reasonably expected to compromise the Seawall. Costs of repairs will be estimated to restore the seawall to the condition prior to being compromised, but not bettered. The economic costs of each of the failure events will be calculated and combined with the frequency of the event, this will be used as the basis for input into a Monte Carlo simulation (or comparable analysis tool) to generate a random stream of events. The report will clearly explain each of the failure events and the system for determining probabilities of failure.

 Estimated time: 640 hours at $88/hour = $56,320

 e. Travel Delays -Benefits are expected to be derived from travel delays from traffic re-routing and congestion under the Seawall failure and Viaduct closure scenario. Without project time and travel delays for public and private transportation routes, including passenger, freight, ferry and railroad. Transportation statistics will be collected from the appropriate agencies and displayed in a spreadsheet model that will estimate the associated economic costs. Costs will be reported separately for each type of transportation on surface streets, highway and freeway systems as average annual costs.

 Estimated time: 480 hours at $88/hour = $42,240

 f. Other Damages - This category includes identifying, investigating and collecting damage and cost information on utilities, clean-up costs, structure demolition and removal costs among other categories.

 Estimated time: 160 hours at $88/hour = $14,080

 g. Recreation Analysis - A recreation analysis will be completed for the waterfront area along the Seawall. Recreation benefits will be calculated using Unit Day Value method as described in the ER 1105-2- 100. Should the Seawall fail and is no longer safe to be in the vicinity of the Seawall the recreation experience would be lost. Results will be reported incrementally and annualized. Unit Day Values will be determined for the present baseline condition and translated into a dollar value for recreation.

 Estimated time: 240 hours at $88/hour = $21,120

 h. Risk and Uncertainty Analysis (R&U): Guidance requires that risk and uncertainty be completed on all feasibility level studies. R&U analysis will be preformed on each of the without project condition damage categories. The model developed will incorporate generally accepted risk based analysis tool, such as "@ Risk" or a comparable product, and may include a monte carlo simulation.

 Estimated time: 160 hours at $88/hour = $14,080

 i. Report Preparation - Assemble the narrative with-out project conditions Economic appendix.

 Estimated time: 60 hours at $88/hour = $5,280

 j. Address review comments - Following submition of the without project condition report, technical review comments will be address and changes or modification will be made to the without project condition report.

 Estimated time: 120 hours at $88/hour = $10,560

 2. With-Project Conditions

 a. Update the without project condition. As necessary, update all costs, interest rate, real estate values etc.

 Estimated time: 80 hours at $88/hour = $7,040

 b. Evaluate alternative impacts on each of the damage categories, travel and time delays and, recreation. The future without and with- project conditions will be measured against the baseline condition.

 Estimated time: 480 hours at $88/hour = $42,240

 PURPOSE

 The purpose of the studies described below is to document the environmental baseline of the study area, and to identify impacts that would be associated with providing storm damage reduction. This Project Management Plan is based on the alternatives presented in the June 2003 Reconnaissance Report (Section 905(b) Analysis).

 This PMP also assumes that at least some of the work completed by the City of Seattle, and Washington State Department of Transportation (with Federal Highways Administration) for their EIS (on which we are a cooperating agency) will provide sufficient background and/or analysis for NEPA documentation for this study. The major issues identified through the City/WSDOT (Fall 2003) scoping process included traffic impacts, economic impacts, transit impacts, noise, air and water quality impacts, and marine environment impacts. Also mentioned were aesthetic impacts, open space concerns, public safety, and all impacts associated with construction, including the duration of construction. We will need to conduct formal scoping with interested parties and the resource agencies. Additional issues of concern may be identified during our scoping.

 Regardless of studies conducted by the City and WSDOT, the Corps anticipates additional studies will be necessary to augment and/or provide further impact analysis once more project information becomes available. This budget recognizes the abundance of extant data regarding this project while allowing for the Corps to generate additional data where appropriate.

 The VE study is based on an email exchange with Rick Lambert:

 Tim:

 Here is a first draft for the paragraph description of the VE study that we propose to conduct on the Seattle seawall.

 "Conduct value engineering study for Seattle seawall project using OVEST CX study team. OVEST will provide a 5 person team consisting of geotechnical, civil, structural, and interdisciplinary engineers and environmental specialist.

 The study team will follow the 5 step VE job plan: information gathering, speculation, analysis, development, and presentation phases. The sponsoring District will provide representatives of the design team to assist in the information, speculation and analysis phases of the study. Cost to utilize OVEST to conduct the VE study including labor, travel, and per diem will be approximately $55,000".

 Plan formulation, Feasibility report preparation, Project Management Plan, Program and Project Management, Draft Project Cooperation Agreement

 Plan formulation and evaluation:

 * Review of prior work: Prior work includes alternatives formulation, engineering support, cost estimates, and alternatives evaluation. The Corps team members will review the documentation of the prior work. $25,000.

 * Without project conditions analysis: The without project conditions analysis for all projects has recently been called out for more attention by Corps HQ. The without project conditions analysis will generate a memorandum for independent technical review. This analysis itself is part of the economics task, but this separate task is included to emphasize the without project conditions memo and review. I estimate $10,000 to prepare the memo and fund the review.

 * Plan formulation and evaluation: Alternatives formulation and screening based on prior City effort, as well as formulation and screening of alternatives other than those the City considered. Engineering development of alternatives is not included in this task. Preparation for the AFB is included. $25,000 Corps, $10,000 City.

 * Alternative Formulation Briefing: Required review of the selection of the recommended plan, to include HQ. See ER 1105-2-100. Washington level participation funded by "Washington level review and approval" task. District and City preparation and participation estimated at $6,000

 Feasibility Report Preparation: This task includes taking the technical work already done and compiling it into a report. The report "tells the story" of how the recommended plan is arrived at. The task breaks down into writing the draft report, review, and writing the final report. Most of the information included in the report comes from other tasks, so this task does not include all of the effort to prepare the report; rather it is a compilation of the products of other tasks, with narrative to tie it together.

 * Draft report preparation: Write report. Team will include PM and assistant, City PM, engineer, economist, and environmental coordinator. At about 10 days each, $42,000. most team members will need less than 10 days, the PM will probably need much more.

 * Draft report ITR: The ITR team will review the draft report, submit comments, and then review the final report to close comments. About 7 reviewers, about 5 days each, plus DrChecks management. $35,000

 * Final report preparation: Address comments from the ITR. 20 days, $15,000

 Project Management Plan: The PMP will be finalized and approved prior to commencing the study.

 * Review and Maintenance: The PMP will be updated as needed. At least annually, the PMP will be revised to reflect the expected budget for the following year. This task will be lead by the Corps PM, and will involve the City PM and various team members. The task is estimated at roughly $5000 per year, divided between City and Corps.

 Program and Project Management:

 * Program Management: The budget analyst is funded at approximately 7% of Corps of Engineers funding level of the project, which is a standard funding level for Seattle District projects. Because calculating this creates a circular calculation in the spreadsheet, it is set at approximately 7%, rather than trying to get it exact.

 * Project Management: The overall PM effort is estimated at 1.25 persons, based on size and complexity of the project. Based on the average rate of Tim Shaw and Becky Jahns, the monthly cost of 1.25 persons is approximately is $16,000, or $192,000 per year, for the Corps. Estimate a similar level for the City.

 * Executive committee: The executive committee is expected to meet a several of times each year. There are currently eight members shown at the executive level. The PMs' labor is covered by the PM budget. Eight executives, at about $100/hour, would cost about $1600, depending on meeting length. Estimate about $10,000 per year for the executive committee task to get a meeting about every two months.

 * PED Cost Sharing Agreement: The PED agreement will probably use the model agreement. As part of this task, a PMP for the PED phase will be required. I expect that effort to be much simpler than preparing the PMP for the study since the scope will be better known at that time. The PMP for the study has cost about $50,000 to prepare. I estimate $25,000 for preparation of the PED agreement and PMP for the PED phase, mostly Federal.

 * Lessons Learned: Lessons learned will consist of a single partial- day meeting, with appropriate staff representing the spectrum of activities. Estimate $5000 for this task.

 Draft Project Cooperation Agreement:

 The PCA for this project will probably contain deviations from the model. Negotiations of this sort are difficult to scope accurately in advance. The Corps will have the lead, and will probably have higher costs. I estimate $20,000 for the Corps effort, and $15,000 for the City effort.
