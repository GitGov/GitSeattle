 AN ORDINANCE relating to land use and zoning of adult cabarets, extending the moratorium on the issuance of use permits, and on the acceptance of applications for use permits or building permits, for adult entertainment premises as defined in SMC 6.270.

 BE IT ORDAINED BY THE CITY OF SEATTLE AS FOLLOWS:

 Section 1. The City Council hereby adopts the following findings of fact:

 a. There are a number of adult cabarets located near residential areas throughout the City;

 b. There is growing evidence that such uses constitute a threat to the public health, safety, and welfare;

 c. In April 2003, the City Council passed and the Mayor signed Ordinance 121117 establishing a moratorium through June 30, 2004 on new adult cabarets within the City pending additional City analysis and evaluation;

 d. The City Council of Auburn, Washington imposed a moratorium on the filing of any applications for licenses, permits, or approvals for sexually-oriented businesses, and has extended the moratorium several times while the City of Auburn and its Planning Commission continue their study and evaluation of the issues involved in sexually-oriented businesses and develop recommendations for zoning code and land use regulations for sexually-oriented businesses. This evaluation has included analysis of various types of adult businesses and how they are defined, negative impacts and secondary effects of sexually- oriented businesses, appropriateness of creating buffer zones around adult uses, appropriateness of amortizing non-conforming businesses, and other issues. The City of Seattle needs to review and analyze the results of the City of Auburn's study and evaluation, including recommendations for any new legislation;

 e. The Seattle City Council has developed a work plan for developing and evaluating land use code amendments for adult entertainment uses; and

 f. The Council recognizes that it will take some months for the Executive to prepare proposed legislation and for the Council to review and take action, and therefore finds that the protection of the public health, safety, and welfare requires extending the moratorium on new adult cabarets.

 Section 2. The Council directs the Executive branch, through the Mayor and the Department of Planning and Development (DPD), (a) to prepare and submit to the Council proposed legislation to amend the Land Use Code to define "adult cabarets" as a use and to specify in what zones, and under what conditions, adult cabarets are a permitted use; (b) to prepare a Director's Report to accompany the proposed legislation; and (c) to complete environmental review as required under the State Environmental Policy Act (SEPA). DPD is directed to work with the Council to develop criteria to address neighborhood and community issues related to siting of adult cabarets. The Council directs the Executive to complete these steps and submit proposed legislation to the Council no later than September 1, 2004.

 Section 3. Through June 30, 2005 or until new land use regulations governing the location of adult cabarets take effect, whichever is sooner, no use permit shall be issued, nor shall any use permit application or building permit application be accepted, for any new adult entertainment premises as defined in SMC 6.270.

 Section 4. Pursuant to SMC 25.05.880, the City Council finds that an exemption under SEPA for this action is necessary to prevent an imminent threat to public health and safety and to prevent an imminent threat of serious environmental degradation through continued development under the existing regulations. SEPA review of any permanent regulations proposed for replacement of the existing zoning shall be conducted.

 Section 5. This ordinance shall take effect and be in force thirty (30) days from and after its approval by the Mayor, but if not approved and returned by the Mayor within ten (10) days after presentation, it shall take effect as provided by Municipal Code Section 1.04.020.

 Passed by the City Council the ______ day of _______________, 2004, and signed by me in open session in authentication of its passage this ______ day of _______________, 2004. _________________________________ President __________of the City Council

 Approved by me this ______ day of _______________, 2004. _________________________________ Gregory J. Nickels, Mayor
