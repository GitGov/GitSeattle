These provisions are not intended for the preservation of contents, the timely restoration of operations, or for assistance in fire suppression or overhaul activities. Smoke control systems regulated by this section serve a different purpose than the smoke- and heat-venting provisions found in Section 910. Mechanical smoke control systems shall not be considered exhaust systems under Chapter 5 of the International Mechanical Code.

 [B] 909.2 General design requirements. Buildings, structures, or parts thereof required by the International Building Code or this code to have a smoke control system or systems shall have such systems designed in accordance with the applicable requirements of Section 909 and the generally accepted and well- established principles of engineering relevant to the design. The construction documents shall include sufficient information and detail to describe adequately the elements of the design necessary for the proper implementation of the smoke control systems. These documents shall be accompanied with sufficient information and analysis to demonstrate compliance with these provisions.

Code Alternate CA909: Smoke control systems complying with the following in lieu of Sections 909.6, 909.7, 909.8 and 909.18.6 may be approved for high-rise buildings.1. Building Ventilation.

Air for stairway pressurization shall be introduced supplied near the bottom of the shaft and at intervals sufficient to maintain the required pressure throughout the shaft. several other points in the shaft. Note: The performance goal for item 2.5 is compliance with minimum and maximum pressures at all levels of the shaft, and to ensure upward flow of air and smoke.2.6 Shaft pressurization air intakes shall be located at the exterior of the building.

EXCEPTION: Intakes for elevator shaft pressurization may be located within the building provided they are located no more than 20 feet (6096 mm) from major openings in the building exterior such as loading docks and vehicular entrances. Such intake shall be provided with smoke detectors which shall deactivate the pressurization system for that shaft. 2.7. Whenever shaft pressurization is activated, all horizontal exit doors which have hold-open devices shall be automatically released to close.2.8. Other measures to prevent loss of pressurization shall be provided in the design and construction of shafts, such as quality of workmanship and caulking of penetrations and joints.2.9.

 CHAPTER 93 MINIMUM STANDARDS FOR HIGH-RISE BUILDINGS

 Point of Information The requirements of this Chapter originated in City of Seattle Ordinance 110299, effective January 23, 1982. Where used in this Chapter, the term "Building Code" shall mean the 1982 Seattle Building Code. Where used in this Chapter, the terms "this Code" and "the fire code" shall mean the 1982 Seattle Fire Code.

 SECTION 9301 GENERAL

 9301.1 Purpose. The main purpose of this article is to improve the fire and life safety of existing high-rise buildings that do not conform to current City codes so that the health, safety and welfare of the general public is provided for and promoted. It is recognized that the application of present day fire protection techniques to some existing high-rise buildings is difficult. For this reason, this article may permit the use of alternative methods and innovative approaches and techniques to achieve its purpose, when approved by the chief and the Building Official.

 9301.2 Scope. This article shall apply to all high-rise buildings in existence at the time of its adoption, as well as to all high-rise buildings coming into existence after the adoption thereof.

 9301.2.1 Hazards and design features. Whenever the chief shall find a condition in a high-rise building not specifically addressed in this chapter, which in his opinion makes fire escape or fire fighting unusually difficult, he shall declare it to be a hazard, notify the owner of such condition and order its correction in a manner consistent with these minimum safeguards.

 9301.2.2 Exempt Buildings. The chief and the Director of the Department Planning and Design may exempt high-rise buildings that meet the requirements of Section 403 of the 1982 Seattle Building Code from complying with provisions of this chapter.

 9301.2.3 Conflicts. Where there is a conflict between the provisions of this chapter and the provisions of an ordinance or code adopted after January 23, 1982, the provisions of the later adopted ordinance or code shall apply.

Such staff are properly trained to monitor the annunciator panel and report alarm signals to the fire department alarm center via the 9-1-1 system. 2. One or more building staff is on duty 24 hours a day and, remains in the direct vicinity of the annunciator panel, e.g., a hotel desk clerk where the panel is behind the registration desk. 3. Staff persons in low income high-rise buildings whose primary duty requires them to be at the front desk are available.

 DEAD-END CORRIDOR: A corridor which permits only one direction of travel from a unit or normally occupied room door to an exit, or which intersects an exit corridor on one end and does not provide an exit path on the other end. A corridor which has fire escapes directly accessible from it is not a dead-end corridor.

 FLOOR USED FOR HUMAN OCCUPANCY: A floor designed and intended for occupancy by one or more persons for any part of a day, including a roof garden and an active storage area. An area that is permanently unoccupied or is occupied for the service of building equipment only is not included in this definition.

 HIGH-RISE BUILDING: Buildings having floors used for human occupancy located more than 75 feet above the lowest level of fire department vehicle access.

 LOW INCOME RESIDENTIAL BUILDINGS: Are defined for this chapter as those buildings that meet the following requirements: 1. At least fifty percent (50%) of the dwelling or housing units as defined in the Housing Code (Seattle Municipal Code Ch. 22.204) are rented to non-transient persons at a rent at or below .9% of the current median income for all families in the Seattle area as determined by the United States Department of Housing and Urban Development; and 2. The average monthly rent for all dwelling or housing units in the building does not exceed 1.4% of the Median Income Limit.

 For purposes of calculating the average monthly rent, a room which is rented on a hostel-style basis to three (3) or more non-related persons shall be considered as one room rented for $200 per month.

 Monthly rent shall include all charges for shelter and provision of items normally associated with such use, but shall not include board, health care, telephone charges and other such items.

 SECTION 9302 EXITS

 9302.1 General. All exits in high-rise buildings shall be illuminated as required in Section 1211 of this Code and enclosed with a minimum of one-hour fire resistive construction. Every high-rise building shall have at least one such exit. Where existing exterior fire escapes are used for additional exits, they shall be tested and identified as required in Section 9302.3.

 9302.2 Smokeproof enclosure. Where a high-rise building has a single, enclosed exit, the enclosure shall be continued to the exterior of the building and the exit shall be smoke-proof by mechanical ventilation in accordance with Section 3310 of the 1982 Seattle Building Code, or shall be mechanically pressurized with fresh air to 0.15 inches water column and shall have a concurrent 2500 cubic feet per minute (CFM) exhaust to atmosphere in an emergency, in accordance with the provisions of the Building Code.
