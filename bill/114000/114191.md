 Mr. Tony Perez, Director Office of Cable Communications City of Seattle Key Tower, Suite 2700 700 Fifth Avenue Seattle, WA 98104-5065

 RE: FCC Form 394 Filed March 4, 2002 - City of Seattle AT&T Corp. Merger Transaction

 Dear Mr. Perez:

 We understand that the City of Seattle (the "Franchising Authority") has several concerns relating to certain compliance and other matters under the franchise held by TCI Cablevision of Washington, Inc. and United Community Antenna Systems, Inc., jointly known as AT&T Broadband ("Franchisees").

 We acknowledge receipt of letters by the Franchising Authority notifying the Franchisees of certain franchise violations and understand that the Franchising Authority has identified other issues that may result in additional franchise violations if not addressed by the Franchisees in a timely manner. We also acknowledge that the Franchising Authority has identified other issues that require additional discussion.

 The Franchising Authority has notified the Franchisees that it could not recommend approval of the transfer of control request without specific commitments from the Franchisees to cure outstanding franchise violations and a commitment to work in good faith to preempt the possibility of incurring additional violations. In addition, we recognize that the Franchising Authority believes that it would also be appropriate within the present context to continue discussions about other matters of mutual concern. These items are more specifically set forth below and the parties agree to the described method for addressing their resolution:

 1. Current pending notices of franchise violations:

 Franchisees agree to cure all outstanding franchise violations by October 18, 2002. By September 6, 2002 the Franchisees shall provide the Franchising Authority a plan, acceptable to the Franchising Authority, for implementing specific measures to cure the following outstanding franchise violations. Franchisees acknowledge that the Franchising Authority has assessed or may assess liquidated damages pursuant to the franchise for any specific franchise violations until Franchisees have achieved compliance with any respective obligations. Franchisees agree to pay assessed liquidated damages, pursuant to the City's letter dated January 30, 2002, due by October 18, 2002.

 (a) Failure to provide a second Subscriber Service Center

 (b) Failure to abide by reporting requirements: telephone response statistics; submission of annual report, which was due May 1, 2002.

 2. In addition to the foregoing, the Franchising Authority and the Franchisees agree that it would be appropriate to discuss the items and issues identified below with the goal of reaching mutually satisfactory solutions separate and independent from the consent process and commit to initiating discussions on the following matters by September 30, 2002:

 (a) Franchisees' commitment to prior planning before migrating customers to a new high speed data domain name to mitigate service disruption

 (b) Franchisees' peering arrangement at a local carrier hotel

 (c) SCAN: air system; fiber connection to headend

 (d) Seattle Center fiber ownership

 (e) Franchisees' community center cable modem installation process

 3. The Franchising Authority and the Franchisees agree that there are issues that have been identified which are appropriate to discuss as part of the franchise renewal process, including Franchisees' ability to secure a franchise for the Central Business District by July 2004. Franchise renewal discussions for the franchises currently in effect can be expected to begin within the next 12 - 18 months, but the parties may begin discussions of these issues prior to the formal opening of the renewal process. The following is not intended to represent an exhaustive list of all the issues that will be discussed by the parties during renewal negotiations.

 * Extension of senior, disabled and low income discounts to service options other than basic service;

 * City's TV Channel : inclusion of programming in electronic and other program guides .

 * Bundled services: the City wants to ensure that revenues received by the Franchisees from subscribers are appropriately allocated among the various services for accurate determination of franchise fees.

 * Democracy Portal: Identification of ways that the Franchisees can work with the City to support the delivery of electronic municipal services and methods for citizens to easily and meaningfully interact with their elected officials and decision makers.

 It is understood that the consent to the transfer of control of the franchise shall not extinguish the Franchising Authority's right and ability to pursue any remedy against the Franchisees available under the franchise with respect to any compliance issues not mutually resolved or identified herein. This letter may be referenced in any action taken by the Franchising Authority concerning the proposed transfer of control or franchise compliance.

 It is also understood and agreed that the Franchising Authority and the Franchisees shall not be deemed or construed to have waived any claims, actions, or defenses with respect to identified issues, or other possible or alleged franchise violations that remain unresolved. In particular AT&T Comcast, the Franchisees and the City acknowledge the Franchisees' dispute with the City over the applicability of the City's utility tax to Franchisees' high speed data service, and will seek resolution of this issue in an appropriate venue.

 By signing below the parties acknowledge and agree to the matters described herein above.
