 ORDINANCE __________

 AN ORDINANCE relating to the contract rezone granted by Ordinance 119855, which amended Plats 29E and 29W, page 89 and 90 of the Official Land Use Map to rezone property located at 2201 Aurora Avenue North and the Boston Street right-of-way from Single Family 5000 (SF 5000) to Commercial One with a 65-foot height limit (C1/65'); accepting an Amended Property Use in connection therewith.

 AMENDED PROPERTY USE AND DEVELOPMENT AGREEMENT

 THIS INSTRUMENT is executed this date in favor of the City of Seattle, a Municipal Corporation (herein called "City") by Ray Head, the owner of property legally described below (herein called "Owner").

 WITNESSETH:

 WHEREAS, Owner owns a fee simple and/or substantial beneficial interest in the properties described in Exhibit A attached hereto and incorporated by reference; and

 WHEREAS, Owner has filed a petition (C.F. 229227) with the City to rezone the Property from Single Family 5000 (SF5000) to Commercial 1 with a 65 foot height limit (C1/65') and a petition (C.F. 297165) to vacate a portion of Boston Street that is part of the Property; and

 WHEREAS, the Transportation Committee of the City Council held a public hearing which began on June 4, 1991, and thereafter recommended to the full Council that the petition be granted subject to certain conditions including the execution and recording of an agreement with the City ("Street Vacation PUDA") which required, inter alia, compliance with a development design requiring the requested rezone, and the Council granted the petition as amended; and

 WHEREAS, on November 10, 1993, the Director of the Department of Construction and Land Use ("DCLU") recommended that the rezone be granted subject to the following conditions:

 The owner(s) and/or applicant(s) shall:

 1. Demonstrate that all future plans fully comply with the Property Use and Development Agreement (PUDA) as required as a condition of the vacation of a portion of Boston Street, C.F. 297165.

 2. Demonstrate that all future plans fully comply with the Environmentally Critical Areas Ordinance, including Director's Rules 2-93 and 3-93; and

 WHEREAS, on March 22, 1994 the Housing, Community Development, and Urban Environment Committee voted to recommend approval of the rezone, pending execution and receipt of the street vacation PUDA, which was then under review; and

 WHEREAS, Ray Head executed a street vacation PUDA on June 20, 1997, which PUDA has not yet been accepted because other conditions of the vacation have only recently been met; and

 WHEREAS, the City's Street Vacation Policies contemplate timely completion of conditions, and further contemplate that vacations contingent on a specific project will not be finalized until assurances are given that the project will be completed;

 WHEREAS, when Ray Head attempted to comply with the condition requiring construction of an acceleration/deceleration lane permitting access to the property from Aurora Avenue North, he was informed by Seattle Transportation staff that construction of a acceleration/deceleration lane is currently not necessary nor recommended;

 NOW, THEREFORE, Owner hereby covenants, bargains and agrees on behalf of itself and its successors and assigns that it will comply with the following limitations and conditions in consideration of the rezone of the Property from Single Family 5000 (SF 5000) to Commercial 1 with a 65 foot height limit.
