 ORDINANCE __________________

 AN ORDINANCE relating to the regulation of floating homes and floating home moorages, amending SMC 7.20.080 concerning the criteria to be considered by the Hearing Examiner when reviewing rent increases, amending SMC 7.20.130 to require that floating home tenants be informed in advance of moorage sales and amending SMC 7.20.150 to change the penalties for noncompliance.

 NOW THEREFORE,

 BE IT ORDAINED BY THE CITY OF SEATTLE AS FOLLOWS:

 Section 1. Section 7.20.080 of the Seattle Municipal Code, which was last amended by Ordinance 120794, is amended as follows:

 SMC 7.20.080 Moorage fee increases -- Hearing.

 A. A moorage owner seeking a moorage fee increase shall give the floating home owners affected thereby a written notice, at least thirty (30) days before the increase will go into effect, stating the amount of the increase, financial computations demonstrating the need for the increase, and the effective date of the increase. If the proposed moorage fee increase is to be based, in whole or in part, on a cost basis established by a sale, lease or other transaction concerning the moorage property or facilities, then the notice shall include identification of the parties to the transaction, all material terms of the transaction and an explanation as to whether and how the transaction resulted in a genuine change in control of the property or facilities so as to justify the use of a new cost basis.

 B. If at least one-half (1/2) of the floating home moorage site lessees in a floating home moorage, excluding the moorage owner and those who have an ownership interest in the moorage, who are subject to a moorage fee increase in the same percentage amount (plus or minus one percentage point (1%) believe that the demanded fee increase is unreasonable, they may collectively file a petition for review with the Hearing Examiner. The petition shall be in the form of a sworn statement which shall: (1) be signed by each petitioning moorage site lessee; (2) list separately the name and floating home address of each such moorage site lessee; and (3) include a statement of the intention of each moorage site lessee to contest the proposed moorage fee increase. In determining whether at least half of those affected have petitioned only one signature per moorage site will be counted. The petition shall be filed within fifteen (15) days of receipt of written notification of the moorage fee increase. The person or persons filing a petition for review shall pay a filing fee of Twenty-five Dollars ($25.00) per petitioner, with a maximum fee of Seventy-five Dollars ($75.00), to the City Director of Executive Administration, which fee shall be refunded if no hearing is required. The Hearing Examiner may consolidate the petitions contesting moorage fee increases at the same moorage.

 C. The Hearing Examiner's review shall to the extent possible be based upon written memoranda, sworn statements, and affidavits submitted by the parties. The moorage owner shall, as soon after the filing of the petition as practicable, file with the Hearing Examiner and serve upon the petitioning floating home moorage site lessees or their representative, a memorandum and any necessary affidavits or sworn statements in support of the proposed increase. The floating home moorage site lessees shall submit a responsive memorandum and affidavits within fifteen (15) days of receipt of the moorage owners' submission. The Hearing Examiner shall review the memoranda, affidavits, and sworn statements and advise the parties in writing of: (1) the legal and factual issues to be resolved; (2) the time and place for the hearing; and (3) the length of time that each party will have to present his or her case. In connection with such review the Hearing Examiner may require any party to the proceedings to provide any information needed to determine whether the demanded moorage fee increase is reasonable. Either party's failure to provide information requested by the Hearing Examiner may, at the Hearing Examiner's discretion, result in a finding or findings against the party refusing to provide the information as regards facts that could be proved or disproved by the requested information.

 D. 1. The Hearing Examiner shall find whether that portion of the proposed moorage fee increase which is in excess of that permitted in Section 7.20.090, or an increase in a lesser amount, or no increase in excess of that permitted in Section 7.20.090, is necessary to assure a fair and reasonable return to the moorage owner and shall order such increase as is found necessary to assure a fair and reasonable return. In making the determination, the Hearing Examiner, in addition to any other factors deemed relevant, shall consider the following factors: (a)the purchase or lease price of the moorage and the terms of any transaction relied upon to establish the cost basis for the moorage;b~~1~~ increases or decreases since the last moorage fee increase in the expenses of operation and maintenance of the floating home moorage; provided, that such expenses are for services, repairs, property maintenance, or any other expenses which are reasonable and necessary for the continued operation of a floating home moorage; c~~2~~ the reasonable costs of capital improvements since the last moorage fee increase to the floating home moorage property which benefit the floating home owners occupying moorage sites at the floating home moorage; d~~3~~ increases or decreases since the last moorage fee increase in necessary or desirable services furnished by the floating home moorage owner or operator where such increased or decreased services affect the person or persons initiating the fact-finding proceedings; e~~4~~ substantial deterioration since the last moorage fee increase in the facilities provided for the occupants of moorage sites at such floating home moorage due to failure of the moorage owner or operator to perform ordinary repairs, replacement and maintenance of the floating home moorage property and improvements; f~~5~~ comparability with moorage fees charges for other floating home moorage sites in the City; and g~~6~~ a reasonable return on leased land.

2. Whenever the sale or lease price of a moorage or the terms of any transaction concerning the moorage are cited as a factor in demonstrating that a rent increase or any part thereof is necessary to assure a fair and reasonable return to the owner, the Examiner will allow sufficient time for discovery as appropriate under applicable Hearing Examiner Rules. The Hearing Examiner may rely on this factor as supporting a rent increase or any part thereof only if the moorage owner demonstrates at hearing that the sale or other transaction relied upon resulted in a genuine change in control of the moorage sufficient to justify a new cost basis for the moorage.

 E. No contested moorage fee increase shall take effect until approved by the Hearing Examiner's written decision; provided that the moorage owner or operator may recover retroactively from the date of the notice of the increase, with interest at the prevailing rate for United States Treasury bills on the date of the decision, such increases as are found reasonable by the Hearing Examiner. It shall be unlawful for a moorage owner or operator to demand, charge, or collect any moorage fee in excess of the amount approved by the Hearing Examiner for a period of one (1) year from the effective date of any permitted fee increase, unless the moorage owner can show either that extraordinary damage to the moorage occurring after the decision has necessitated cost increases which make it impossible to realize a reasonable return without a fee increase, or that the floating home owner has rented the floating home to another at a profit; provided, that moorage owners may increase fees in the amount of any increases in state lease or City license fees whenever such increases are incurred, and may increase fees for the purpose of recovering the costs of capital improvements authorized by Section 7.20.090 whenever such improvements are required. Any fee increase necessitated by extraordinary damage shall be subject to Hearing Examiner review whenever such review is requested by at least one- half (1/2) of the floating home moorage site lessees affected, any other provision in this chapter to the contrary notwithstanding.

 Section 2. Section 7.20.130 of the Seattle Municipal Code, which was enacted by Ordinance 11526, is amended as follows:

 SMC 7.20.130 Notices.

B.It is unlawful for a moorage owner to fail to notify each floating home moorage site lessee at that moorage that the moorage is being offered for sale. This notification shall be in writing and shall be provided at least ninety (90) days but not more than one year prior to the date the moorage owner takes any action to offer the moorage for sale. Actions triggering the notice requirement of this subsection include, but are not limited to, entering into a listing agreement with respect to the moorage or advertising the moorage for sale in any public forum.  C. It is unlawful for a new moorage owner to fail to give, within seven (7) days of a change in ownership of the moorage, notice to each floating home moorage site lessee of the change of ownership and address and telephone number of the new moorage owner.
