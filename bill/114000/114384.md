 COUNCIL CONDITIONS ON THE ALLEY IN BLOCK 5, HEIRS OF SARAH A. BELL, C.F. 302587

 The City Council granted the vacation subject to the following conditions:

 1. The alley vacation is granted to allow the petitioners to design and develop an office tower and housing project with ground floor retail in a manner substantially in conformity with the proposal presented to the City Council and for no other purpose.

 The western building, 700 Olive Tower, which houses the mixed use office and retail space is completed. The design has conformed to the Council proposal and Seattle Design Commission recommendations. The eastern building, Stewart Court is completed. It provides about 65 units of affordable rental housing as presented to Council.

 2. All utility issues shall be resolved to the full satisfaction of the affected utilities. These may include easements, restrictive covenants, relocation of the utilities, or acquisition of facilities. All work shall be at the sole expense of the petitioner and shall be performed to the satisfaction of the utilities. During construction special provisions shall be made to ensure there is no disruption of service to the Marsh and McClennan Building. The utilities include Seattle City Light, US West (now Qwest), Seattle Transportation, Puget Sound Energy.

 The petitioner has resolved all utility issues related to the vacation. They have executed and recorded easements to protect affected facilities:

 * Seattle City Light, Recording Number 20011128001290

 * Seattle Transportation, Recording Number 20010105001610

 * Puget Sound Energy, Recording Number 20020301000545

 * Qwest, Recording Number 20001208001119

 * The petitioner coordinated with the Marsh and McClennan Building to ensure that there was no disruption of service during construction.

 3. The petitioner is encouraged to continue to work with the Seattle Jobs Initiative and to the extent feasible direct both construction activity and newly created jobs to women and minority citizens and businesses.

 The petitioner worked with the Office of Economic Development and provided status reports regarding apprenticeship usage. They have directed their operational subcontractors to continue to work with Seattle Jobs Initiative as employment needs arise.

 4. All street improvements and the location of street improvements such as parking ingress/egress, service and loading areas shall be designed to SeaTran standards and shall require the approval of SeaTran.

 Seattle Transportation has approved the street improvements.

 5. The petitioner shall ensure that the building design at the alley entrances be compatible with the pedestrian character of the streets. This objective, as outlined in the revised plans, may be achieved by:

 * Olive Way entrance: require that the building with its connection to the sidewalk extend and wrap into the alley similar to the adjacent Marsh and McLennan building.

 * Stewart Street alley entrance: provide a street level use between the exit from the parking garage and the alley.

 This work shall require the review and agreement of SeaTran and the Department of Design, Construction and Land Use.

 The project includes facade design that extends the Olive Way treatment into the alley. A retail space is located between the exit from the parking garage and the alley on Stewart Street.

 6. The petitioner shall continue to work on the streetscape surrounding the building with the goal of enhancing the pedestrian environment. This could include providing street furniture, public art, a way-finding information system, small scale design for the ground floor retail such as having entry points at 20-foot intervals, or other means to engage pedestrians, or an office lobby that invites public interaction in the building.

 The petitioner has provided building design features that enhance the pedestrian environment: continuous glass canopy, special canopy lighting, detailed granite facade and main entrance paving, art windows, extensive windows to display lobby art, lobby furniture and transit information in the lobby.

 7. The petitioner shall include a transit oriented commuter information center or other commuter support services in the ground floor of the structure to enhance the transit node.

 The petitioner has provided transit information within the lobby and has installed signage indicating the transit information is available.

 8. Alley access to the Marsh and McLennan building and to the public shall be preserved. A Property Use and Development Agreement or some other mechanism shall be required to ensure that Marsh and McLennan and the public will continue to have alley access and uninterrupted service access.

 This ordinance accepts an alley access easement, Recording Number 20020325002050, preserving public access through the vacated alley and ensuring access for the Marsh and McLennan Building.

 9. The proposal is to provide approximately 65 units of low and moderate-income housing.
