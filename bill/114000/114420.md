 AN ORDINANCE amending the 2003 Budget; changing appropriations and positions for various departments and funds in the 2003 Budget; amending the ordinance introduced as C.B. 114343; and correcting errors in budget action sheets reflected in C.F. 305415; all by a three-fourths vote of the City Council.

 WHEREAS, the 2003 Budget adopted by the ordinance introduced as C.B. 114343, passed by the City Council on November 18, 2002, incorrectly reflected some actions approved by the Budget Committee; and

 WHEREAS, the City Council and Mayor want to correct those errors; NOW, THEREFORE,

 BE IT ORDAINED BY THE CITY OF SEATTLE AS FOLLOWS:

 Section 1. The City Council and Mayor wish: (a) to amend the 2003 adopted budget to reflect increases or decreases in appropriations to pay for necessary costs and expenses to be incurred in 2003, but for which insufficient appropriations were made; and (b) to correct Summit codes and Fund codes in some of the "2003-2004 City Council Budget Action (Green Sheet)" actions approved by the Budget Committee that are reflected in C.F. 305415, which was adopted and filed by the City Council on November 18, 2002; and (c) to distinctly establish budget provisos that may not have been clearly reflected in C.F. 305415; and (d) to correct information regarding revenue that is anticipated to be received in 2003 that was inadvertently omitted from or erroneously described in some of the "2003-2004 City Council Budget Action (Green Sheet)" actions approved by the Budget Committee that are reflected in C.F. 305415; and (e) to correct information regarding positions that are created or abrogated in 2003 that was inadvertently omitted from or erroneously described in some of the "2003-2004 City Council Budget Action (Green Sheet)" actions approved by the Budget Committee that are reflected in C.F. 305415.

 A. To accomplish this, the 2003 budget as adopted by the ordinance introduced as C.B. 114343 is amended by reducing to zero all appropriations made by the ordinance introduced as C.B. 114343.

 B. To further accomplish this, the proposed appropriations in the Proposed 2003 Annual Budget shown as the first year of the biennial budget submitted by the Mayor, filed as the "2003-2004 Proposed Budget" in C.F. 305414, as modified by the recommendations of the Budget Committee of the City Council as set forth in C.F. 305555 and adopted by the City Council on December 2, 2002, are hereby adopted as the appropriations for the City's 2003 Annual Budget. In case of conflicting modifications, the one of later date shall control. The budget provisos set forth in C.F. 305555 are effective as restrictions on the purposes for which certain portions of appropriations are made. Use of any amount of these restricted portions of appropriations for any other purpose than that stated, or for any purpose expressly excluded, whether by transfer pursuant to SMC Chapter 5.08 or by any other means, is prohibited.

 C. To further accomplish this, Section 3 of the ordinance introduced as C.B. 114343 is amended as follows:

 Section 3. Effective January 1, 2003, or thereafter if otherwise provided, the officer and employee positions designated for 2003 in the "Mayor's Proposed 2003 and 2004 Position List" in C.F. 305495, with modifications resulting from (a) the changes requested by the Mayor in the errata, a list of which is filed in C.F. 305495, (b) the further corrections requested by the Mayor, a list of which is filed in C.F. 305495, (c) new proposals from the Mayor, a list of which is filed in C.F. 305495, (d) the reclassifications made by the Personnel Director from July 1, 2002, through October 25, 2002, a list of which is filed in C.F. 305495, (e) the reclassifications made by the Personnel Director from October 26, 2002, through December 31, 2002, (f) if Council Bill 114388 becomes law, the elimination of any Zoo positions in the Department of Parks and Recreation that are vacant on December 31, 2002, and that are listed in C.F. 305495 as being in the Woodland Park Zoo Budget Control Level, (g) the recommendations of the Budget Committee of the City Council as set forth in Table 6A in C.F. 305555~~C.F. 305415 and adopted by the City Council on November 18, 2002~~, and (h) the addition and elimination, respectively, of regular positions created or abrogated by ordinances passed after the date of passage of this ordinance, are hereby established as the regular positions in the various departments or agencies shown, including such abrogations and reductions during the 2003 budget year as are indicated therein. In case of conflicting modifications, the one of later date shall control. This ordinance establishes, for each department or office: the number of full-time regular positions and the number of part-time regular positions in each position classification (title) listed. The administrative or organizational structure of the various City departments or agencies shown in the 2003 Adopted Budget as modified by any reorganization ordinances passed in the same month as this ordinance shall, for 2003, supersede any existing or inconsistent organization established in previous budgets for such department or agency.

 Section 2. The several provisions of this ordinance are declared to be separate and severable and the invalidity of any clause, sentence, paragraph, subdivision, section, or portion of this ordinance, or the invalidity of the application thereof to any person or circumstance, shall not affect the validity of the remainder of this ordinance or the validity of its application to other persons or circumstances.

 Section 3. In accordance with RCW 35.32A.060, by reason of the facts above stated, the foregoing appropriations are made to meet actual necessary expenditures of the City for which insufficient appropriations have been made due to causes which could not reasonably have been foreseen at the time of the making of the 2003 Budget.

 Section 4. Any acts consistent with the authority and prior to the effective date of this ordinance are hereby ratified and confirmed.

 Section 5. This ordinance shall take effect and be in force thirty (30) days from and after its approval by the Mayor, but if not approved and returned by the Mayor within ten (10) days after presentation, it shall take effect as provided by Municipal Code Section 1.04.020.
