 Seattle Department of Transportation

Scope of Work:

 Bridge and Guideway Advisory Activities

 Seattle Transportation ("Seattle Department of Transportation" or "SDOT") will utilize a consultant to supplement internal structural review staff to assist SDOT to complete all review tasks within SMP's schedule. All consultant work will be done as a series of work orders under a single, on-call contract. It is the intention of SDOT to use the same consultant for all tasks, subject to satisfactory performance by the consultant in each task. Additional tasks and/or other related work will be added by work order to the original agreement for this work.

West Seattle Bridge

 SDOT will undertake bridge studies, analysis, development of design criteria, development of interagency agreements, evaluation, monitoring, recommendations, load ratings testing design, plan review and reports related to the West Seattle Bridge.

 SDOT will provide attendance at and input to the Technical Committee meetings, currently scheduled to be held on a weekly basis for 1.5 hours. In addition to the meetings, SDOT will review and comment on engineering studies, concepts and plans developed by SMP for Technical Committee review.

 SDOT will also provide input from members of the Expert Review Panel, subconsultants and staff as appropriate to provide input to issues that arise during the course of the Technical Committee review meetings.

Monorail Guideway

 SDOT and its consultant will prepare for, attend, and provide input to the Guideway Technical Committee meetings as SDOT deems necessary. The guideway meetings with SMP are currently scheduled to be held once per month for approximately two hours.

 SDOT and consultants will review, comment on, and make recommendations regarding engineering studies, concepts and plans developed by SMP.

Ship Canal Bridge

 SDOT and its consultant will prepare for, attend, and provide input to the Ship Canal Bridge Technical Committee meetings as SDOT deems necessary. The ship canal bridge meetings with SMP are currently scheduled to be held twice per month for approximately two hours.

 SDOT and consultants will review, comment on, and make recommendations regarding engineering studies, concepts and plans developed by SMP.

 Financial Management & Administration

 SDOT will provide centralized financial management and administration for the City's pre-construction activities, including accounting to support centralized expenditure reporting, accounting and reconciliation of City expenditures and SMP compensatory payments, and administrative support for coordinated City pre-construction activities.

 Plan Review & Permitting--Station MUPs & Utility Relocation Plans

 In support of development of utility relocation plans, cost estimates and criteria for the SMP RFP and contract, SDOT will provide timely responses to requests for information and reviews of civil design (roadway, structural and lighting design), traffic operations and management, and environmental management issues that may affect utility relocation plans and cost estimates.

 In support of the development and review of Master Use Permit applications for Green Line stations and a monorail operations center, SDOT will provide timely responses to SMP requests for information and reviews of civil design (roadway, structural and lighting design), traffic operations and management, and environmental management issues.

 Construction Phasing, Constructability, Quality Assurance/Control Plans

 SDOT will consult with and advise SMP on issues related to:

 a) construction phasing, including coordination between the Green Line and other concurrent projects;

 b) constructability issues, with particular attention to utility relocation, West Seattle Bridge improvements, the Ship Canal Bridge, and special structures; and

 c) development of integrated SMP and City quality assurance and quality control plans.

 Department of Design, Construction and Land Use ("DCLU")

 Scope of Work

 Urban Design and Planning Activities

 Urban Design Activities

 DCLU will conduct activities related to the urban design components of the Project. These activities will include:

 * coordinate with SMP on the aspects of the Project that relate to and are informed by the City's Station Area Planning efforts;

 * continue direct consultation with SMP on the urban design aspects of the Project as design of the system elements proceeds;

 * review of 30% and 60% design of Project elements to determine consistency with the recommendations of the Monorail Review Panel of the Seattle Design Commission and with City policies;

 * prepare design guidelines and detailed design criteria that would guide both the SMP and the City on the urban design aspects of the Project through the design of the Project and permit reviews;

 * provide input on City policy and code changes that may arise with further design of the Project and preparation of station area action plans;

 * provide public outreach and communication regarding the City's review of the Project design and permit applications;
