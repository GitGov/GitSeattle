 ORDINANCE __________________

 AN ORDINANCE changing the purposes for which proceeds from the sale of certain properties may be used and amending Ordinance 120830 in connection therewith; all by two-thirds vote of the City Council.

 WHEREAS, on June 17, 2002, the City Council passed Ordinance 120830, relating to the Fleets and Facilities Department, which declared property identified below surplus to the City's needs, approved the sale of property by public bid; authorized execution of a Quit Claim Deed with respect to each such property, and designated the disposition of sales proceeds; and

 WHEREAS, Ordinance 120830 concerned the following real properties in King County, Washington:

 PMA #77: Lots 4, 5 and 6, Block 32, Rainier Beach Addition, recorded in Vol. 8 of Plats, Page 11, Records of King County, WA, together with Lots 28 through 33, inclusive, Block 32, 2nd Subdivision of Rainier Beach Addition, recorded in Vol. 11 of Plats, Page 71, Records of King County, WA;

 WHEREAS, Ordinance 120830 directed that proceeds of the sale of the above-described properties be placed in a special subaccount of the Cumulative Reserve Subfund and used solely for property acquisition and related costs; and

 WHEREAS, the Mayor's proposed 2003 budget calls for using $400,000 of such proceeds to acquire property for Squire Park, but the Council has identified other funding sources for acquiring the Squire Park property, thereby freeing $400,000 to be used for general City purposes;

These proceeds may be used for property acquisition and related costs only , except that in 2003 up to $400,000 of these proceeds may be transferred to the General Subfund to be applied to general city purposes through the annual budget.
