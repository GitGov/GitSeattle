 ORDINANCE _________________

 AN ORDINANCE relating to the City Light Department; authorizing the sale of the City's eight percent ownership share of Skookumchuck Dam.

 WHEREAS, Skookumchuck Dam was built as an auxiliary component of the Centralia coal-fired steam plant, which was sold by the City and other owners to TransAlta Corporation in 2000. The dam is still owned by seven Pacific NW utilities holding these respective shares: PacifiCorp (47.5%), Avista (17.5%), the City of Tacoma (8%), Snohomish County PUD (8%), Puget Power (7%), Grays Harbor County PUD (4%) and the City of Seattle (8%); and

 WHEREAS, Skookumchuck Dam is surplus to the City's needs; and

 WHEREAS, at the time the Centralia plant was sold to TransAlta, Lewis County had expressed interest in purchasing Skookumchuck Dam separately for purposes of flood control, however, the county's potential funding sources have not materialized; and

 WHEREAS, recent changes to federal dam safety standards have rendered the dam a potential cost liability if substantial structural changes are required; and

 WHEREAS, TransAlta is interested in acquiring the property at a purchase price of $7.57 million, of which the City would receive $605,630. TransAlta has also agreed to pay Operations & Maintenance (O&M) costs retroactive to May 5, 2002 (the beginning date of TransAlta's option to purchase the dam), which is expected to accrue to around $45,000 for the City by the time of closing; and

 WHEREAS, TransAlta and several owners have already signed a Purchase and Sale Agreement specifying the terms of the transaction; and

 WHEREAS, the City's execution of the Purchase and Sale Agreement and other related documents would allow the property sale transaction to be completed; NOW, THEREFORE,

 BE IT ORDAINED BY THE CITY OF SEATTLE AS FOLLOWS:

 Section 1. The Superintendent of the City Light Department is hereby authorized to execute on behalf of the City any and all documents which may be necessary to sell Seattle's eight percent ownership interest in Skookumchuck Dam and related properties to TransAlta, together with any ancillary ownership interests in appurtenances to the plant.

 The Superintendent is specifically authorized to work in concert with the other owners of the Dam to effect this transaction. The contracts which the Superintendent is expected to execute are: (1) Skookumchuck Facilities Purchase and Sale Agreement and (2) Exhibit C, Special Warranty Deed, substantially in the form of the attached Exhibits A and B .

 Section 2. The proposed sale of the City's ownership interest in Skookumchuck Dam, under the agreed upon terms with TransAlta, will relieve the City of maintenance obligations and any future liability associated with this property that is surplus to the needs of the City.

 Section 3. Any acts taken in furtherance of the purpose of this ordinance, prior to its effective date, are hereby ratified and confirmed.

 Section 4. This ordinance shall take effect and be in force thirty (30) days from and after its approval by the Mayor, but if not approved and returned by the Mayor within ten (10) days after presentation, it shall take effect as provided by Municipal Code Section 1.04.020.

 Passed by the City Council the ____ day of _________, 2004, and signed by me in open session in authentication of its passage this _____ day of __________, 2004.

If a Supplemental Report discloses an exception to title that is not a Permitted Encumbrance and is not a monetary lien or an interest of Washington Irrigation and Development Company that is to be satisfied or removed by Sellers on or before the Closing Date (a "New Exception"), Buyer shall have 30 days after receipt of the Supplemental Report in which to notify Sellers in writing of Buyer's disapproval of any New Exception shown in the Supplemental Report. If Buyer fails to so notify Seller of its disapproval of any New Exception within such period, such exception shall be deemed a Permitted Encumbrance and set forth on Schedule 3.7. If Buyer notifies Seller of it disapproval of one or more New Exceptions, Seller shall have sixty (60) days to (i) remove the disapproved exception(s) and proceed to Closing; or (ii) refuse to remove the disapproved exception(s), in which case Buyer may elect to waive its objection and proceed to Closing or, if such exception would adversely affect the operation of the Facilities after Closing for their intended purposes, terminate this Agreement without liability to either Buyer or Sellers. This Section 5.4 sets forth Buyer's exclusive remedy with respect to any New Exception to title.

The representations and warranties of Sellers set forth in Article 3 of this Agreement shall be true in all material respects as to the Assets or the LLC Interests in question and as of the date of this Agreement (unless the inaccuracy or inaccuracies which would otherwise result in a failure of this condition have been cured as of the Closing) and as of the Closing (as updated by the revising of Schedules contemplated by Section 6.2) as if made as of such time, provided that any such update shall not have disclosed any change in the physical condition, ownership, or transferability of the Assets or the LLC Interests that would have a Material Adverse Effect on the Assets or the LLC Interests.

 Section 8.3 Officers' Certificate. Buyer shall have received from Sellers an officers' certificate, executed on behalf of each Seller by its chief executive officer, president, vice president, chief financial officer or treasurer (in his or her capacity as such) dated the Closing Date and stating that to the Knowledge of such individual, the conditions in Sections 8.1 and 8.2 above have been met with respect to such Seller.

 Section 8.4 Approvals. All approvals, consents, authorizations and waivers from Governmental Bodies (as delineated on Schedules 3.3(b) and 4.4(b) and all approvals, consents, authorizations and waivers from other third parties (collectively "Approvals") required for Sellers to transfer the Assets to the LLC and for Buyer to purchase the LLC Interests and operate the Facilities materially in accordance with the manner in which they were operated by Sellers prior to the Closing, shall have been obtained and (if Buyer is affected by any such approval) shall be in form and substance (including the regulatory treatment and financial impacts thereof on Buyer) satisfactory to Buyer in its reasonable discretion.

 (a) Injunction, restraining order or order of any nature issued by any court of competent jurisdiction or Governmental Body which directs that the transactions contemplated hereby shall not be consummated as herein provided or compels or would compel Buyer to dispose of or discontinue, or materially restrict the operations of, the Facilities or any significant portion of the Assets with respect thereto or the LLC Interests as a result of the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby;

 (b) Suit, action or other proceeding by any Governmental Body pending or threatened (pursuant to a written notification), wherein such complainant seeks the restraint or prohibition of the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby or seeks to compel, or such complainant's actions would compel, Buyer to dispose of or discontinue, or materially restrict the operations of, the Facilities or any significant portion of the Assets or the LLC Interests as a result of the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby; or

 (c) Action taken, or Law enacted, promulgated or deemed applicable to the transactions contemplated hereby, by any Governmental Body which would render the purchase and sale of the LLC Interests illegal or which would threaten the imposition of any penalty or material economic detriment upon Buyer if such purchase and sale were consummated;

 Provided that the parties shall use their reasonable efforts to litigate against, and to obtain the lifting of, any such injunction, restraining or other order, restraint, prohibition, action, suit, Law or penalty.

 Section 8.6 Title Insurance.

 (a) Title Policy. The commitment by the Title Insurer (or an Affiliate thereof) or other title company mutually acceptable to the parties to issue at regular rates an ALTA owner's, or lessee's, as the case may be, extended coverage policy of title insurance (1990 Form B) in the coverage amount of $3,800,000.00 (the "Title Policy "), with the general survey and creditors' rights exceptions removed, showing title to such interests in such real property vested in the LLC. Such Title Policy shall show title vested in the LLC, subject only to the Permitted Encumbrances.

 (b) Evidence of Commitment. The commitment of the Title Insurer to issue the Title Policy shall be evidenced either by the issuance thereof at the Closing or by the Title Insurer's delivery of written commitments or binders, dated as of the Closing, to issue such Title Policy within a reasonable time after the Closing Date, subject to actual transfer of the real property in question. If the Title Insurer is unwilling to issue any such Title Policy, it shall be required to provide Buyer and Sellers, in writing, notice setting forth the reason(s) for such unwillingness as soon as practicable. Sellers shall have the right to seek to cure any defect which is the reason for such unwillingness, and to extend the Closing and the Termination Date, if necessary, for a period of up to ten (10) Business Days to provide to Sellers the opportunity to cure. In the event that, despite Sellers' efforts to cure, the Title Insurer remains unwilling to issue any such Title Policy on the Closing Date (as may be extended as provided herein), then Buyer, at its option, may terminate this Agreement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Buyer or the pertinent Buyer Affiliate may accept such title to any such property interests as Sellers may be able to convey, and such title insurance with respect to the same as the Title Insurer is willing to issue, in which case such interests shall be conveyed as part of the Assets without reduction of the Facilities Purchase Price or any credit or allowance against the same and without any other liability on the part of Sellers.

If any part of the Facilities is damaged or destroyed (whether by fire, theft, vandalism or other casualty) in whole or in part prior to the Closing, and the Net Book Value of the damaged or destroyed Assets or the cost of repair of the Assets that were damaged or destroyed is less than 15 percent of the aggregate Facilities Purchase Price, Sellers shall, at their option, either (i) reduce the Facilities Purchase Price by the lesser of the Net Book Value of the Assets damaged or destroyed (such value to be determined as of the date immediately prior to such damage or destruction), or the estimated cost to repair or restore the same, (ii) upon the Closing, transfer the proceeds or the rights to the proceeds of applicable insurance to Buyer, provided that the proceeds or the rights to the proceeds are obtainable without delay and are sufficient to fully restore the damaged or destroyed Assets, or (iii) repair or restore such damaged or destroyed Assets and, at Sellers' election, delay the Closing and the Termination Date for a reasonable time necessary to accomplish the same. If any part of the Assets related to the Facilities are damaged or destroyed (whether by fire, theft, vandalism or other cause or casualty) in whole or in part prior to the Closing and the lesser of the Net Book Value of such Assets or the cost of repair is greater than 15 percent of the aggregate Facilities Purchase Price, then Buyer may elect to terminate this Agreement or require Sellers upon the Closing to transfer the proceeds (or the right to the proceeds) of applicable insurance to Buyer and Buyer may restore or repair the Assets.

 (b) Condemnation. From the date hereof until the Closing, in the event that any material portion of the Facilities becomes subject to or is threatened with any condemnation or eminent domain proceedings, then Buyer, at its option, may, (i) if such condemnation, if successful, would not practically preclude the operation of the balance of the Facilities for the purposes for which it was intended, elect to terminate this Agreement with respect only to that part which is condemned or threatened to be condemned with a reduction in the Facilities Purchase Price determined as provided in Section 8.7(a) above, or (ii) if such condemnation, if successful, would practically preclude the operation of the balance of the Facilities for purposes for which it is intended, elect to terminate this Agreement.

 Section 8.8 Receipt of Other Documents. Buyer shall have received the following:

 (a) Copies of all current Licenses relevant to operation of the Facilities and all third party and Governmental Body consents, permits and authorizations that Sellers have received in connection with this Agreement and any other agreement contemplated hereby and the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby to occur at the Closing; and

All of the Persons constituting Sellers shall have delivered all documents, instruments and writings required to be delivered to Buyer at or prior to Closing pursuant to this Agreement and none of the Persons constituting Sellers shall have retained any rights, title or interest in any of the Assets or the LLC Interests except for the Excluded Assets.

 Section 8.10 Material Adverse Effect. There shall not have been an impairment of any Asset or the LLC Interests, as a result of a degradation of its physical condition, a change in Law, a change to, modification in or amendment to (by order or otherwise) any License, or a provision of any Approval that could reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on the LLC Interests or Buyer's ability to operate the Facilities.

 Section 8.11 LLC Contribution. Sellers shall have contributed, transferred, conveyed and assigned all rights, title and interest in the Assets to the LLC in a manner and in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to Buyer.

Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the parties agree that immediately prior to the Closing, all of the Assets will be contributed by Sellers to the LLC in exchange for all the membership interests in the LLC. If at such time the Washington Ruling has not issued, the parties shall promptly negotiate in good faith amendments to this Agreement that will provide for the conveyance of the Assets by Sellers directly to Buyer with such amended Agreement being substantially in the form of this Agreement. The parties will endeavor to execute such amended Agreement prior to the last date the Closing may occur pursuant to Section 10.2. In no event, however, shall the failure of the Washington Ruling to timely issue or the failure of the parties to amend this Agreement be a condition to Closing hereunder.

 Section 10.2 Closing. Subject to the terms and conditions hereof, the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby (the "Closing") shall occur at the offices of Stoel Rives LLC in Seattle, Washington, or a mutually agreeable place or places within five (5) Business Days after all of the conditions set forth in Article 8 and Article 9 hereof have been satisfied or waived or at such other time as the parties may agree, but in no event later than the Termination Date set forth in Section 11.1(d). The date on which the Closing actually occurs is referred to herein as the "Closing Date." The Closing shall be effective for all purposes at 11:59 p.m., Pacific Time, on the Closing Date. At the Closing and subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, the following will occur:

 (a) Deliveries by Sellers. Sellers shall deliver to the LLC such instruments of transfer and conveyance properly executed and acknowledged by Sellers in customary form mutually agreed to by Sellers and Buyer necessary to transfer to and vest in the LLC all of Sellers' rights, title and interest in and to the Assets or which may be required by the Title Insurer, including, without limitation:

 (i) Bills of sale and assignment in respect of the Assets;

 (ii) Special Warranty Deeds in the form attached as Exhibit C, properly executed and acknowledged by Sellers with respect to each of the Owned Real Property included in the Assets, and related excise tax affidavits executed by both Sellers and Buyer (provided that Seller shall not be required to deliver Statutory Warranty Deeds or Statutory Bargain and Sale Deeds);

 (iii) Assignment and assumption agreements properly executed and acknowledged by Sellers with respect to each Assigned Contract included in the Assets;

 (iv) Instruments of transfer, sufficient to transfer personal property interests that are included in the Assets but not otherwise transferred by the bills of sale and assignment referred to in clause (i) above, properly executed and acknowledged in the form customarily used in commercial transactions in Washington; and

 (v) Possession of the Assets which shall include, without limitation, keys, codes, passcodes and/or combinations to all locks and vehicles.

 (b) Sellers shall deliver to Buyer an assignment of all of the interests in the LLC.

 (c) Sellers shall deliver to Buyer a copy of Form 8832 as filed with the Internal Revenue Service (regarding the classification of the LLC as a disregarded entity), as contemplated in Section 3.17.

Buyer shall, or shall cause Buyer Affiliates to, deliver to Sellers immediately available funds, by way of wire transfer to an account or account designated by Sellers, in an aggregate amount equal to the Facilities Purchase Price and such instruments of assumption properly executed and acknowledged by Buyer and the pertinent Buyer Affiliates in customary form mutually agreed to by Buyer and Sellers necessary for Buyer to assume the liabilities described in Section 2.6, including, without limitation:

 (i) Assignment and assumption agreements properly executed and acknowledged by Buyer and the pertinent Buyer Affiliates with respect to each Assigned Contract included in the Assets; and

 (ii) An assumption agreement or assumption agreements in favor of Sellers.

 Section 10.3 Escrow. If either Buyer or Sellers desire to consummate the Closing through an escrow, an escrow shall be opened with, and the escrow agent shall be, the Title Insurer or an Affiliate thereof (the "Escrow Agent"), by depositing a fully executed copy of this Agreement with the Escrow Agent to serve as escrow instructions. This Agreement shall be considered the primary escrow instructions between the parties, but the parties shall execute such additional standard escrow instructions as the Escrow Agent shall require in order to clarify the duties and responsibilities of the Escrow Agent. In addition, prior to the Closing the parties shall provide the Escrow Agent with an estimated closing statement setting forth the parties' best estimate of all of the closing costs to be paid by the parties. Within 30 days after the Closing Date, Escrow Agent shall prepare a final closing statement reflecting the actual final closing costs and provide it to Buyers and Sellers for review. Any adjustments required pursuant to the final closing statement shall be paid by the owing party within 45 days after the Closing Date. In the event of any conflict between this Agreement and such additional standard escrow instructions, this Agreement shall prevail. If the Closing is to be consummated through the Escrow Agent, the parties shall deliver the funds, instruments of sale, assignment, conveyance and assumption called for by Section 10.2 to the Escrow Agent, and on the Closing Date, the Escrow Agent shall close the escrow by:

 (a) Causing the deeds for the Owned Real Property and any other documents which the parties may mutually designate to be recorded in the official records of the appropriate counties in which the pertinent Assets are located;

 (b) Delivering to Sellers by wire transfer of immediately available funds, to an account or accounts designated by Sellers, the amounts called for in Section 10.2; and

 TERMINATION

 Section 11.1 Termination. In addition to any other rights of termination set forth in this Agreement, any transactions contemplated hereby that have not been consummated may be terminated:

 (a) At any time, by mutual written consent of Sellers and Buyer; or

 (b) By either Buyer or Sellers, as the case may be, upon 30 days' written notice given any time after (i) the issuance of an order by a Governmental Body in a manner that fails to meet the conditions of the terminating party set forth in Sections 8.4 or 9.4, as the case may be, or (ii) 270 days have elapsed from the filing after the date hereof of all applications for approval of this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby by Governmental Bodies and a final order has not been obtained with respect to each such application, it being understood that such 270-day period shall not include any period after such order during which applications for rehearing or modification or judicial appeals or remedies are pending; or

 (c) By one party upon written notice to the other if there has been a material default or breach under this Agreement by another party which is not cured by the earlier of the Closing Date or the date 30 days after receipt by the other party of written notice from the terminating party specifying with particularity such breach or default; or

 (d) By either Buyer or Sellers upon written notice to the other party, if (i) the Closing shall not have occurred by the Termination Date; or (ii) (A) in the case of termination by Sellers, the conditions set forth in Article 9 for the Closing cannot reasonably be met by the Termination Date and (B) in the case of termination by Buyer, the conditions set forth in Article 8 for the Closing cannot reasonably be met by the Termination Date, unless in either of the cases described in clauses (A) or (B), the failure of the condition is the result of the material breach of this Agreement by the party seeking to terminate. The Termination Date for the Closing shall be the date that is twelve (12) months from the date hereof. Such date, or such later date as may be specifically provided for in this Agreement (including any date arising under operation of Sections 8.6 and 8.7(a) hereof) or agreed upon by the parties, is herein referred to as the "Termination Date." Each party's right of termination hereunder is in addition to any other rights it may have hereunder or otherwise; or

 (e) By Buyer, upon written notice to Sellers not later than ten (10) Business Days prior to the Closing Date, if Buyer has reasonably determined that the Safety Program will result in required seismic or other safety modifications to the Facilities that exceed $14,000,000. Such written notice will include a reasonably detailed explanation as to why Buyer believes costs of seismic or other safety modifications will exceed $14,000,000, together with supporting evidence (including copies of consultants reports) for that conclusion. The parties shall, within 30 days after the date of such notice, meet in good faith to discuss Buyer's notice. If Buyer has properly given notice, does not waive the objection and the parties do not, for any reason, enter into a written modification within the 30 day period, Buyer may elect to terminate this Agreement upon written notice to Sellers within five (5) days after the end of such period. If Buyer terminates pursuant to this provision, Sellers shall have no further obligation to Buyer for maintenance or operation of the Facilities.

 Section 11.2 Effect of Termination. If there has been a termination pursuant to Section 11.1 or pursuant to any other provisions of this Agreement, then this Agreement shall be deemed terminated, and all further obligations of the parties hereunder shall terminate, except that the obligations set forth in Section 5.3 and in Articles 12 and 13.9 shall survive. In the event of such termination of this Agreement, there shall be no liability for damages on the part of a party to another under and by reason of this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby except as set forth in Article 12 and except for intentionally fraudulent acts by a party, the remedies for which shall not be limited by the provisions of this Agreement. The foregoing provisions shall not, however, limit or restrict the availability of specific performance or other injunctive or equitable relief to the extent that specific performance or such other relief would otherwise be available to a party hereunder.

 Section 11.3 Modification of Terms. In the event any Governmental Body entertains, as an alternative to approval of this Agreement and any other agreement contemplated hereby, any proposal of one or more third parties to acquire the Facilities from Sellers on terms and conditions that include a higher purchase price than the Facilities Purchase Price set forth herein, and such terms and conditions are acceptable to Sellers, then and in that event, subject to such restrictions and requirements as such Governmental Body may impose upon Sellers, Sellers shall exercise their best efforts to afford to Buyer the right to enter into appropriate amendments and modifications of this Agreement to match such proposed alternate terms and conditions. Buyer shall be entitled to exercise such right by delivery of written notice thereof to Sellers within three (3) Business Days after its receipt of written notice from Sellers that, in Sellers' good faith belief, the proposals of such third party or parties makes it unlikely that such Governmental Body will approve this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby in a timely fashion and that the alternate terms and conditions are acceptable to Sellers. If such right is not exercised and such Governmental Body proceeds to decline to grant its approval, the termination provisions of Section 11.1 shall apply.

 ARTICLE XII

 (ii) If the Closing occurs, the LLC, Buyer, Buyer Affiliates and their respective Affiliates shall be entitled only to recover the amount by which the aggregate Losses sustained or suffered by them exceed $500,000 (the "Deductible Amount"), provided, however, that individual claims of $5,000 or less shall not be aggregated for purposes of calculating either the Deductible Amount or the excess of Losses over the Deductible Amount and Buyer shall be entitled to recover on a dollar for dollar basis all claims for Losses covered under insurance maintained by Sellers; and

 (iii) If the Closing occurs, in no event shall Sellers and their Affiliates be liable to the LLC, Buyer, Buyer Affiliates and their respective Affiliates for Losses in the nature of consequential damages, incidental damages, indirect damages, punitive damages, special damages, lost profits, damage to reputation or the like, but such damages shall be limited to out-of-pocket Losses and diminution in value; provided, however, that damages for all Losses shall be limited to an aggregate limit under this Agreement equal to the Facilities Purchase Price.

 (c) The liability of Sellers under this Agreement shall be several and not joint or collective and no individual Seller shall be jointly or severally liable for the acts, omissions or obligations of any other Seller.

 Section 12.4 Indemnity by Buyer.

 (a) Buyer shall indemnify and hold harmless Sellers and each of them, and each Affiliate of Sellers or any of them, from and against any and all Losses which they or any of them may sustain or suffer or to which they may become subject as a result of:

 (i) The inaccuracy of any representation or the breach of any warranty made by Buyer in this Agreement;

 (ii) The nonperformance or breach of any covenant or agreement made or undertaken by Buyer in this Agreement; and

 (iii) If the Closing occurs, the failure of the LLC or Buyer to pay, discharge or perform as and when due.

 (b) The indemnification obligations of Buyer provided above shall, in addition to the qualifications and conditions set forth in Sections 12.5 and 12.6, be subject to the following qualifications:

 (i) Sellers and their Affiliates shall not be entitled to indemnity for Losses unless written notice to Buyer of such claim specifying the basis thereof is made, or an action at law or in equity with respect to such claim is served, before the second (2nd) anniversary of the earlier to occur of the Closing Date or the date on which this Agreement is terminated, as the case may be;

 (ii) If the Closing occurs, Sellers and their Affiliates shall be entitled only to recover the amount by which the aggregate Losses suffered or sustained by them exceed the Deductible Amount, provided, however, that individual claims of $5,000 or less shall not be aggregated for purposes of calculating either the Deductible Amount or the excess of Losses over the Deductible Amount; and

 (iii) If the Closing occurs, in no event shall the LLC, Buyer and its Affiliates be liable to Sellers or their respective Affiliates for Losses in the nature of consequential damages, incidental damages, indirect damages, punitive damages, special damages, lost profits, damage to reputation or the like, but such damages shall be limited to out-of-pocket Losses and diminution in value; provided, however, that all Losses shall be limited to an aggregate limit under this Agreement equal to the Facilities Purchase Price.

 Section 12.5 Further Qualifications Respecting Indemnification. The right of a party (an "Indemnitee") to indemnity hereunder shall be subject to the following additional qualifications:

 (a) The Indemnitee shall promptly upon its discovery of facts or circumstances giving rise to a claim for indemnification, including receipt by it of notice of any demand, assertion, claim, action or proceeding, judicial, governmental or otherwise, by any third party (such third party actions being collectively referred to herein as "Third Party Claims"), give notice thereof to the indemnifying party (the "Indemnitor"), such notice in any event to be given within 60 days from the date the Indemnitee obtains actual knowledge of the basis or alleged basis for the right of indemnity or such shorter period as may be necessary to avoid material prejudice to the Indemnitor provided, however, the failure to provide or timely provide the Indemnitor with notice of any Third Party Claim shall only affect the Indemnitee's rights to indemnification to the extent that the Indemnitor is materially prejudiced as a result of the Indemnitee's failure to give timely notice of such Third Party Claim; and

 (b) In computing Losses, such amounts shall be computed net of any related recoveries to which the Indemnitee is entitled under insurance policies, or other related payments received or receivable from third parties, and net of any tax benefits actually received by the Indemnitee or for which it is eligible, taking into account the income tax treatment of the receipt of indemnification.

 Section 12.6 Procedures Respecting Third Party Claims. In providing notice to the Indemnitor of any Third Party Claim (the " Claim Notice"), the Indemnitee shall provide the Indemnitor with a copy of such Third Party Claim or other documents received and shall otherwise make available to the Indemnitor all relevant information material to the defense of such claim and within the Indemnitee's possession. The Indemnitor shall have the right, by notice given to the Indemnitee within 15 days after the date of the Claim Notice, to assume and control the defense of the Third Party Claim that is the subject of such Claim Notice, including the employment of counsel selected by the Indemnitor after consultation with the Indemnitee, and the Indemnitor shall pay all expenses of, and the Indemnitee shall cooperate fully with the Indemnitor in connection with, the conduct of such defense. The Indemnitee shall have the right to employ separate counsel in any such proceeding and to participate in (but not control) the defense of such Third Party Claim, but the fees and expenses of such counsel shall be borne by the Indemnitee unless the Indemnitor shall agree otherwise; provided, however, if the named parties to any such proceeding (including any impleaded parties) include both the Indemnitee and the Indemnitor, the Indemnitor requires that the same counsel represent both the Indemnitee and the Indemnitor, and representation of both parties by the same counsel would be inappropriate due to actual or potential differing interests between them, then the Indemnitee shall have the right to retain its own counsel at the cost and expense of the Indemnitor. If the Indemnitor shall have failed to assume the defense of any Third Party Claim in accordance with the provisions of this Section, then the Indemnitee shall have the absolute right to control the defense of such Third Party Claim, and, if and when it is finally determined that the Indemnitee is entitled to indemnification from the Indemnitor hereunder, the fees and expenses of Indemnitee's counsel shall be borne by the Indemnitor, provided that the Indemnitor shall be entitled, at its expense, to participate in (but not control) such defense. The Indemnitor shall have the right to settle or compromise any such Third Party Claim for which it is providing indemnity so long as such settlement does not impose any obligations on the Indemnitee (except with respect to providing releases of the third party). The Indemnitor shall not be liable for any settlement effected by the Indemnitee without the Indemnitor's consent except where the Indemnitee has assumed the defense because Indemnitor has failed or refused to do so. The Indemnitor may assume and control, or bear the costs, of any such defense subject to its reservation of a right to contest the Indemnitee's right to indemnification hereunder, provided that it gives the Indemnitee notice of such reservation within 15 days of the date of the Claim Notice.

 Section 13.2 Attorneys' Fees. Subject to the provisions of Section 13.9, in any litigation or other proceeding relating to this Agreement, the prevailing party shall be entitled to recover its costs and reasonable attorneys' fees.

 Section 13.3 Successors and Assigns. Except as provided in Section 2.5, the rights under this Agreement shall not be assignable or transferable nor the duties delegable by any party without the prior written consent of the other; and nothing contained in this Agreement, express or implied, is intended to confer upon any Person, other than the parties hereto, their permitted successors-in-interest and permitted assignees and any Person who or which is an intended beneficiary of the indemnities provided herein, any rights or remedies under or by reason of this Agreement unless so stated to the contrary. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Buyer may grant to its lenders a security interest in its rights under this Agreement; provided that neither the grant of any such interest, nor the foreclosure of any such interest, shall in any way release, reduce or diminish the obligations of Buyer to Sellers hereunder, and Sellers shall enter into a consent to assignment with such lenders reasonably acceptable to Sellers.

 Section 13.4 Counterparts. This Agreement may be executed in one or more counterparts, each of which shall be deemed an original, but all of which together shall constitute one and the same instrument.

 Section 13.5 Captions and Paragraph Headings. Captions and paragraph headings used herein are for convenience only and are not a part of this Agreement and shall not be used in construing it.

 Section 13.6 Entirety of Agreement; Amendments. This Agreement (including the Schedules and Exhibits hereto), and the other documents and instruments specifically provided for in this Agreement, including but not limited to the Confidentiality Agreement, contain the entire understanding between the parties concerning the subject matter of this Agreement and such other documents and instruments and, except as expressly provided for herein, supersede all prior understandings and agreements, whether oral or written, between them with respect to the subject matter hereof and thereof. There are no representations, warranties, agreements, arrangements or understandings, oral or written, between the parties hereto relating to the subject matter of this Agreement and such other documents and instruments which are not fully expressed herein or therein. This Agreement may be amended or modified only by an agreement in writing signed by each of the parties hereto. All Exhibits and Schedules attached to or delivered in connection with this Agreement are integral parts of this Agreement as if fully set forth herein.

 Section 13.7 Construction. This Agreement and any documents or instruments delivered pursuant hereto shall be construed without regard to the identity of the Person who drafted the various provisions of the same. Each and every provision of this Agreement and such other documents and instruments shall be construed as though the parties participated equally in the drafting of the same. Consequently, the parties acknowledge and agree that any rule of construction that a document is to be construed against the drafting party shall not be applicable either to this Agreement or such other documents and instruments. Whenever in this Agreement the context so suggests, references to the masculine shall be deemed to include the feminine, references to the singular shall be deemed to include the plural, and references to "or" shall be deemed to be disjunctive but not necessarily exclusive.

 Section 13.8 Waiver. The failure of a party to insist, in any one or more instances, on performance of any of the terms, covenants and conditions of this Agreement shall not be construed as a waiver or relinquishment of any rights granted hereunder or of the future performance of any such term, covenant or condition, but the obligations of the parties with respect thereto shall continue in full force and effect. No waiver of any provision or condition of this Agreement by a party shall be valid unless in writing signed by such party or operational by the terms of this Agreement. A waiver by any party of the performance of any covenant, condition, representation or warranty of any other party shall not invalidate this Agreement, nor shall such waiver be construed as a waiver of any other covenant, condition, representation or warranty. A waiver by any party of the time for performing any act shall not constitute a waiver of the time for performing any other act or the time for performing an identical act required to be performed at a later time.

 Section 13.9 Arbitration.

 (a) Agreement to Arbitrate. Any controversy or claim arising out of or relating to this Agreement, or the breach or alleged breach hereof, shall, upon demand of either Sellers or Buyer, be submitted to arbitration in the manner hereinafter provided. Sellers and Buyer will make every reasonable effort to resolve any such controversy or claim without resort to arbitration. But in the event the parties are unable to effect a satisfactory resolution between themselves, such controversy shall be submitted to arbitration in accordance with the terms and provisions of this Section 13.9 and in accordance with the then current Commercial Arbitration Rules (hereinafter the " Rules") of the American Arbitration Association (or any successor organization) (hereinafter the "AAA"). Any such arbitration shall take place in Seattle, Washington and shall be administered by the AAA. Sellers shall, for purposes of this Agreement, be deemed a single party in any such proceeding. In the event of any conflict between the terms and provisions of this Section and the Rules, the terms and provisions of this Section shall prevail.

 (b) Submission to Arbitration. A party desiring to submit to arbitration any such controversy shall send a written arbitration demand to the AAA and to the opposing party. The demand shall set forth a clear and complete statement of the nature of the claim, its basis, and the remedy sought, including the amount of damages, if any. The opposing party may, within 30 days of receiving the arbitration demand, assert a counterclaim or set-off. The counterclaim or set-off, which shall be sent to the AAA and the opposing party, shall include a clear and complete statement of the nature of the counterclaim or set-off, its basis, and the remedy sought, including the amount of damages, if any.

 (c) Selection of Arbitration Panel. The dispute shall be decided by a panel of three neutral arbitrators selected as follows. The AAA shall submit to the parties, within ten (10) days after receipt of an arbitration demand, a list of eleven potential arbitrators consisting of retired federal or state court judges; provided that none of the potential arbitrators shall have (or have ever had) any material affiliation of any kind with any party or with legal counsel for any party. Each party shall, within five days, strike four, three, two, one or none of the arbitrators, rank the remaining arbitrators in order of preference (with "1" designating the most preferred, "2" the next most preferred and so forth) and so advise the AAA in writing. The AAA shall appoint the arbitrators with the best combined preference ranking on both lists and designate the most preferred arbitrator as presiding officer (in each case, selecting by lot, if necessary, in the event of a tie).

 (d) Prehearing Discovery. There shall be no prehearing discovery except as follows. Subject to the authority of the presiding officer of the arbitration panel to modify the provisions of this paragraph before the arbitration hearing upon a showing of exceptional circumstances, each party (i) shall propound to the other no more than 20 requests for production of documents, including subparts, and (ii) shall take no more than two (2) discovery depositions. Such discovery shall be conducted in accordance with the provisions and procedures of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. No interrogatories or requests for admission shall be permitted. Disputes concerning discovery obligations or protection of discovery materials shall be determined by the presiding officer of the arbitration panel. The foregoing limitations shall not be deemed to limit a party's right to subpoena witnesses or the production of documents at the arbitration hearing, nor to limit a party's right to depose witnesses that are not subject to subpoena to testify in person at the arbitration hearing; provided, however, that the presiding officer of the arbitration panel may, upon motion, place reasonable limits upon the number and length of such testimonial depositions.

 (e) Arbitration Hearing. The presiding officer of the arbitration panel shall designate the place and time of the hearing. The hearing shall be scheduled to begin within ninety (90) days after the filing of the arbitration demand (unless extended by the arbitration panel on a showing of exceptional circumstances) and shall be conducted as expeditiously as possible. In all events, the issues being arbitrated, which shall be limited to those issues identified in the initial claim and counter-claim submitted to the arbitration panel pursuant to Subsection (b) above, shall be submitted for decision within 30 days after the beginning of the arbitration hearing. At least 30 days prior to the beginning of the arbitration hearing, each party shall provide the other party and the arbitration panel with written notice of the identity of each witness (other than rebuttal witnesses) it intends to call to testify at the hearing, together with a detailed written outline of the substance of the anticipated testimony of each such witness. The arbitration panel shall not permit any witness to testify that was not so identified prior to the hearing and shall limit the testimony of each such witness to the matters disclosed in such outline. Subject to the foregoing, the parties shall have the right to attend the hearing, to be represented by counsel, to present documentary evidence and witnesses, to cross-examine opposing witnesses and to subpoena witnesses. The Federal Rules of Evidence shall apply and the panel shall determine the competency, relevance, and materiality of evidence as appropriate. The panel shall recognize privileges available under applicable Law. A stenographic record shall be made of the arbitration proceedings.

 (f) Award. The panel's award shall be made by majority vote of the panel. An award in writing signed by at least two of the panel's arbitrators shall set forth the panel's findings of fact and conclusions of Law. The award shall be filed with the AAA and mailed to the parties no later than 30 days after the last day of testimony at the arbitration hearing. The panel shall have authority to issue any lawful relief that is just and equitable, except consequential damages, incidental damages, indirect damages, punitive damages, special damages, lost profits, diminution in value, damage to reputation or the like. The award shall state that it dissolves and supersedes any provisional remedies entered pursuant to Subsection (g) below.

 (g) Provisional Remedies. Pending the selection of the arbitration panel, upon request of a party, the AAA may appoint a retired judge to serve as a provisional arbitrator to rule on any motion for preliminary relief. Any preliminary relief ordered by the provisional arbitrator may be immediately entered in any federal or state court having jurisdiction thereof even though the decision on the underlying dispute may still be pending. Once constituted, the arbitration panel may, upon request of a party, issue a superseding order to modify or reverse such preliminary relief or may itself order preliminary relief pending a full hearing on the merits of the underlying dispute. Any such initial or superseding order of preliminary relief may be immediately entered in any federal or state court having jurisdiction thereof even though the decision on the underlying dispute may still be pending. Such relief may be granted by the appointed arbitrator or the arbitration panel only after notice to and opportunity to be heard by the opposing party. Such awards of preliminary relief shall be in writing and, if ordered by a panel of three arbitrators, must be signed by at least two of the panel members.

 (h) Entry of Award by Court. The arbitration panel's arbitration award shall be final. The parties agree and consent that judgment upon the arbitration award may be entered in any federal or state court having jurisdiction thereof.

 (i) Costs and Attorneys' Fees. The prevailing party shall be entitled to recover its costs and reasonable attorneys' fees, and the party losing the arbitration shall pay all expenses and fees of the AAA, all costs of the stenographic record, all expenses of witnesses or proofs that may have been produced at the direction of the arbitrators, and the fees, costs, and expenses of the arbitrators. The arbitration panel shall designate the prevailing party for these purposes.

 Section 13.10 Governing Law. This Agreement shall be governed in all respects, including validity, interpretation and effect, by the Laws of the State of Washington applicable to contracts made and to be performed wholly within the State of Washington, provided that federal Law, including the Federal Arbitration Act, shall govern all issues concerning the validity, enforceability and interpretation of the arbitration provision set forth in Section 13.9 hereof. Any judicial action or proceeding arising under this Agreement shall be adjudicated in Seattle, Washington.

 Section 13.11 Severability. Whenever possible, each provision of this Agreement shall be interpreted in such manner as to be valid, binding and enforceable under applicable Law, but if any provision of this Agreement is held to be invalid, void (or voidable) or unenforceable under applicable Law, such provision shall be ineffective only to the extent held to be invalid, void (or voidable) or unenforceable, without affecting the remainder of such provision or the remaining provisions of this Agreement.

 Section 13.12 Consents Not Unreasonably Withheld. Wherever the consent or approval of any party is required under this Agreement, such consent or approval shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed, unless such consent or approval is to be given by such party at the sole or absolute discretion of such party or is otherwise similarly qualified.

 Section 13.13 Time Is of the Essence. Time is hereby expressly made of the essence with respect to each and every term and provision of this Agreement. The parties acknowledge that each will be relying upon the timely performance by the others of their obligations hereunder as a material inducement to each party's execution of this Agreement.

 Section 13.14 Liability. The liability of Sellers under this Agreement shall be several and not joint or collective and no individual Seller shall be jointly or severally liable for the acts, omissions or obligations of any other Seller.

 Section 13.15 Execution. This Agreement may be executed in counterpart and executed signature pages delivered by facsimile.
