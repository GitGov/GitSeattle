 AN ORDINANCE vacating portions of Broad Street, 8th Avenue North, 9th Avenue North, and the connecting ramp between Broad & Mercer, and reserving and granting easements and covenants for utilities, including retaining wall maintenance and sewer (Clerk File 304813).

 WHEREAS, the South Lake Union Neighborhood Plan, approved by City Council in March 1999, calls for the redevelopment of City properties in the Mercer Corridor area; and

 WHEREAS, in December 1999 the City Council passed Resolution 30080, laying out numerous public objectives for the disposition and subsequent redevelopment of City-owned properties in the South Lake Union area and recognizing that redevelopment of those properties is a high priority to provide a gateway to the City and to catalyze economic development and revitalization in the area; and

 WHEREAS, Resolution 30080 also includes objectives for optimizing monetary return and tax revenues to the City; and

 WHEREAS, on June 25, 2001, Council passed Ordinance 12041, which authorized the sale of eight City-owned parcels in the South Lake Union area in accordance with the terms and conditions of a Purchase and Sale Agreement; and

 WHEREAS, the Purchase and Sale Agreement, signed by The City of Seattle and City Investors Inc. on May 18, 2001, includes the contingent sale of the property to be vacated, which is contiguous with one of the parcels sold thereunder; and

 WHEREAS, the Purchase and Sale Agreement also sets the unit value for the property to be vacated, and therefore there is no separate appraisal for its vacation; and

 WHEREAS, the Purchase and Sale Agreement binds City Investors Inc. to purchase the property once it has been vacated and to pay adequate compensation for the property; and

 WHEREAS, the City Council initiated the petition (Clerk File 304813) for the vacation of this property, being portions of Broad Street, 8th Avenue North, 9th Avenue North, and the connecting ramp between Broad & Mercer, as therein described and herein amended per Council condition number 2; and
