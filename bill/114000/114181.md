 AN ORDINANCE relating to the City Light Department; amending Seattle Municipal Code Chapter 21.49 to modify City Light's residential electric rate schedules.

 WHEREAS, in Ordinance 120385 the Council established a third tier rate for residential customer classes that applied to consumption in excess of 60 kWh per day in the summer rate period (April through September) and 125 kWh per day in the winter rate period (October through March); and

 WHEREAS, the third tier rate was set at a level of $0.1600 (city) and $0.1610 (suburban) per kWh for the standard residential classes and $0.0800 (city) and $.0805 (suburban) per kWh for the low-income residential classes, and subsequently adjusted to pass through changes in rates charged by the Bonneville Power Administration; and

 WHEREAS, the third tier rate for standard residential classes was intended to reflect then current prices in the wholesale power market; and

 WHEREAS, the third tier rate was intended to encourage reduction in energy use by the largest residential users during an anticipated time of high market prices caused by the blatant manipulation of the wholesale energy markets and a short-term drought; and

 WHEREAS, prices in the wholesale energy market have at least temporarily returned to more just and reasonable levels; and

 WHEREAS, a long-term approach to resource planning must still emphasize conservation as an essential component of demand and supply management, NOW THEREFORE,

 BE IT ORDAINED BY THE CITY OF SEATTLE AS FOLLOWS:

 Section 1. Section 21.49.030 A of the Seattle Municipal Code is amended to read as follows:
