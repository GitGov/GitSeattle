 ORDINANCE _____________________

 AN ORDINANCE relating to third party billing of Seattle Public Utilities retail services for water, sewer, and solid waste services; and amending the Seattle Municipal Code by adding new sections to SMC Chapters 21.04, 21.28, and 21.40.

 WHEREAS, third-party billing of Seattle Public Utilities (SPU) retail services refers to the practice of an entity other than SPU separately billing tenants of multi-unit buildings for the purpose of apportioning water, sewer, and solid waste consumption; and

 WHEREAS, in multi-unit buildings where the units are not individually metered for water consumption, billing of individual units for the water and sewer services is not based on an exact measure of the occupants' actual water usage; and

 WHEREAS, multi-unit residential buildings normally do not provide individual container service for the tenant's solid waste disposal, and therefore any apportioned billing for solid waste services is normally not based on an exact measure of the occupants' actual service usage; and

 WHEREAS, commodity charges, administrative and other fees of a third party billing system have at times substantially exceeded the commodity and administrative fees charges by SPU; and

 WHEREAS, provisions requiring disclosure of significant information concerning third party billing of SPU services would enable tenants and occupants of individual units to receive greater clarity about the costs reflected in the utility bills received from third party billing entities and more accurately reflect the actual cost of utilities for which they are being billed; and

 WHEREAS, tenants in individual units should have a means of recourse regarding disputed bills or of obtaining clarification about their bill; NOW, THEREFORE,

 BE IT ORDAINED BY THE CITY OF SEATTLE AS FOLLOWS:

 Section 1. A new section of the Seattle Municipal Code is added to SMC Chapter 21.04 to read as follows:

 A. Definitions

 1. 1.

 2. 2. "Multi-unit building" refers to a building with 3 or more tenant units that is served by a single SPU water meter.

 3. "Disclosure" means providing tenants with written information in a clear, concise, and understandable manner on each bill presented from the third party billing entity to tenants.

 B. Third Party Billing and Apportionment Authorized

 Third-party billing for apportioned water services is authorized by this section under the terms and conditions that follow.

 C. Terms and Conditions for Third Party Billing and Apportionment

 1. If a building owner itself apportions water costs among tenants or authorizes a billing agent to provide bills to tenants or receives payments from tenants for water utility charges, the building owner must disclose to the tenants this billing arrangement in writing, either (a) at the initiation of a lease agreement with that tenant or (b) when a change in the terms of tenancy related to third party billing occurs. An additional written notice must also be given whenever the building owner changes billing agents or changes the apportionment methodology.

 2. The total amount of the water charges to all tenants in the building may not exceed the total amount of the charges assessed to the building owner by SPU, plus a reasonable fee for establishing, servicing and billing for tenant utility services.

 f. If billing by estimates or another form of allocation other than direct submetering is used, all bills must disclose the methodology used by the building owner or third party billing entity to allocate the charges for each tenant unit.

 g. A statement of whether the bill is only for the individual tenant unit, or whether it also includes a proportional division of common area uses.

 h. If the bill includes water usage for common areas and facilities such as community pools, laundries, washing machines, recreation areas or buildings, or landscaping, the bill must disclose the methodology used in the apportionment of these amounts.

 i. Itemized list of other fees and charges from the building owner or third party billing entity which are in addition to the apportioned costs or charges billed by SPU to the building owner.

 m. The requirements, costs or conditions to permit any tenant, upon request, to view the records retained by the property owner, including SPU bills to the property owner.

 n. The process and costs required for tenant to request unit meter accuracy tests, if a tenant has reason to believe that the water meter is defective: minimum and maximum charges paid by tenant for plumbing and testing if the meter test indicates that the unit water meter is accurate; charges to tenant if the unit meter is defective; if requests are accepted verbally; response deadline for billing entity to schedule and perform test of the accuracy of the unit meter; if meter test standards used in tests meet AWWA or manufacturer standards.

 5. Nothing in this section shall preclude the tenant from requesting a copy from SPU Customer Services of the SPU bill to the building owner, pursuant to public disclosure requirements.
