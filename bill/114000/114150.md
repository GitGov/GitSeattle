 ORDINANCE __________

 AN ORDINANCE relating to the City's Small Construction Projects Roster, changing bonding and retainage requirements for small construction projects to conform to State law, exempting small construction project bids from current bid protest procedures, and amending Chapters 20.48 and 3.38 of the Seattle Municipal Code in connection therewith.

 WHEREAS, the Small Construction Project Roster Program was initially established, in great part, to provide small businesses with better access to City contracting opportunities for projects with an estimated cost of less than $35,000, and to offer City departments a more expedient way to complete small jobs; and,

 WHEREAS, the State Legislature recently amended Chapter 39.04 to allow local governments to waive the payment and performance bond requirements of RCW Chapter 39.08 and the retainage requirements of RCW Chapter 60.28; and,

 WHEREAS, being fully cognizant of the attendant risks, the City wishes to take advantage of the flexibility of this new provision; and,

 WHEREAS, the current appeal process for Small Construction Project Roster participants calls for the Hearing Examiner to review the decision of the Construction and Consultant Contracting Division Director; and

 WHEREAS, after consulting with the Hearing Examiner, the Department of Finance has determined that the timelines required under the City's current administrative appeal procedures actually negate the time savings provided by using the Roster; NOW, THEREFORE,

 BE IT ORDAINED BY THE CITY OF SEATTLE AS FOLLOWS:

 Section 1. Section 20.48.010 of the Seattle Municipal Code is amended as follows:

 SMC 20.48.010 Contractor's bond required.

 Before any contract for a public work or improvement shall be valid or binding against the City, the contractor shall make, execute and deliver to the City a bond(s) that meets the requirements of RCW Ch. 39.08 as now or hereafter amended. Such bond shall be in an amount equal to not less than twenty-five (25) percent, nor more than one hundred (100) percent of the full contract price agreed to be paid for such public work or improvement. Contract Awarding Authorities shall determine whether to require bond or retainage for limited public works projects awarded under the provisions of RCW 39.04.155(3), as now or hereafter amended. If required, a bond shall name the City as obligee, and shall be filed with the City Clerk. The amount of the b ond to be required of any contractor shall be (1) stated in the call for bids for the doing of the public work or improvement; or (2) if there is no call for bids, as required by the department awarding the contract. Section 2. Subsection 3.38.100 of the Seattle Municipal Code is amended as follows: SMC 3.38.100 Review of Construction & Consultant Contracting ~~Services~~ Division Recommendation for contract awards by the Hearing Examiner.

 A. The Hearing Examiner shall hear and make a recommendation to the Director of Finance with respect to any protest by a bidder in connection with the awarding of a public works or purchase contract including, but not limited to, a determination by the Director of Construction & Consultant Contracting ~~Services~~ regarding: the immateriality of one (1) or more bidding errors, omissions, or variations; selection of a bidder as the apparently lowest and best bidder; implementation of SMC Chapters 20.44 (City Contracts -- Prevention of Discrimination) and 20.46A (Women's and Minority Business Enterprise Utilization); and the rejection or disqualification of any bidder. This subsection shall not apply to protests regarding small construction projects awarded under the provisions of Chapter 20.40 SMC. Those protests shall be heard by the Department of Finance as that Department may provide for by Contract Specification.  Section 3. Any acts consistent with the authority and prior to the effective date of this ordinance are hereby ratified and confirmed.

 Section 4. This ordinance shall take effect and be in force thirty (30) days from and after its approval by the Mayor, but if not approved and returned by the Mayor within ten (10) days after presentation, it shall take effect as provided by Municipal Code Section 1.04.020.
