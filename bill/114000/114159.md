 TRUANCY REDUCTION INITIATIVE- SCHOOL & POLICE PARTNERSHIP

 GRANT STUDY OVERVIEW AND UPDATE

 In 1999, the Seattle Police Department received a School Based Problem Solving grant from the Department of Justice, Office of Community Oriented Policing Services (COPS) to study and recommend interventions regarding truancy at the Aki Kurose Middle School Academy (AKMSA) in Seattle. The study is part of the COPS Office Truancy Reduction Initiative - School & Police Partnership (TRISAPP) Program. AKMSA was chosen for its high truancy rates in comparison to other middle schools of similar size and socioeconomic background of students.

 Truancy is strongly associated with delinquency, dropout, lower academic performance and reduced test scores. Rates of truancy and dropout tend to increase in high school. The experiences of school, law enforcement and court professionals suggests that students who are truant are more likely than non-truants to have disciplinary problems and suspensions on their records, do poorly in their classes, and be involved in crimes. AKMSA finds its students exhibiting similar behavior suspending 37% of students during the school year versus the Seattle School Districts' average of 7%. At project implementation, AKMSA was tied with one other school for the highest middle school truancy rate in the Seattle School District. 13% of students are absent without excuse each school day. On average, AKMSA students do not meet Washington State Learning Standards (WASL) or the national averages of the Iowa Test of Basic Skills (ITBS).

 The goal of this project is to develop an in depth understanding of the relations associated with truancy and of the possible ways to reconnect students to the school. The grant research will combine existing records with survey information to provide a detailed picture of how these relations intersect for different students. This information will allow research participants to make accurate comparisons of the strength of different factors, and how those factors affect different groups of students. Key research methods include focus group discussions, the collection of school records at the level of individual, the collection of police records at the level of individual, and a school wide survey. Once these data have been combined all individual identifiers will be removed from the data set.

 The partnership with the Seattle School District offers this project a unique in-depth view into the interrelations of academics, attendance, student social networks, student attitudes and behaviors related to school, support of family, and how these factors intersect with differences of race, ethnicity, class and gender. Additionally, the SPD grant program has been selected by the COPS Office for inclusion in a national assessment of school based partnerships. 21st Century Solutions, Inc., a crime and public policy consultant, was awarded a grant by the COPS Office to conduct this assessment.

 Preliminary Observations

 There is a dramatic difference between elementary school attendance and middle school attendance. About 10% of AKMSA students had five or more unexcused absences while in fifth grade, but over 40% of them had five or more in sixth grade. Truancy rates increase more gradually in seventh and eighth grade.

 Current sixth and seventh graders have consistently worse attendance than eighth graders at each grade level since the fifth grade. This suggests that truancy is a growing problem. Attendance rates are about the same for boys and girls.

 Students who have two or more friends at school are less likely to be truant than those with one or no friends at school.

 In the study area of AKMSA, certain crime rates are higher when school is in session. Residential burglary, juvenile disturbance and noise disturbance are especially elevated compared to non-school weekdays and weekends. Part of this difference may be due to the actions of students who are truant from school.

 Tutoring both increases student skills and provides support and attention for students who have troubles in their classes. This grant implemented a tutoring program that matches University of Washington sociology students (who receive credit for their work and provide progress reports to AKMSA) with classrooms that are most likely to have students with attendance problems.

 SPD School Resource Officers and Seattle Team for Youth (STFY) Officers visit the homes of students who have five or more unexcused absences and deliver a letter informing them of the consequences of further truancy. The hope is that a personal visit from law enforcement officers will have a positive effect on attendance.
