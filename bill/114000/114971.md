 ORDINANCE _________________

 AN ORDINANCE relating to the Office of Hearing Examiner; adding a new subsection to Chapter 3.02 of the Seattle Municipal Code authorizing the Hearing Examiner to provide hearing examiner services to other public entities and to accept compensation for those services for deposit into the General Subfund.

 WHEREAS, the Office of Hearing Examiner's caseload is determined entirely by factors outside the Office's control and fluctuates widely; and

 WHEREAS, the Hearing Examiner would like to try to stabilize the caseload, and thus the work of the Examiner and Deputy Examiner, at a high level, through contracting to provide hearing services with several smaller jurisdictions; and

 WHEREAS, no additional staff or payment of overtime would be required for the Office of Hearing Examiner to provide contract hearing services, as only salaried employees would perform the extra work; and

 WHEREAS, compensation received from contracts for the Office of Hearing Examiner's services

 would defray some of the costs of maintaining the Office;

 NOW, THEREFORE,

 BE IT ORDAINED BY THE CITY OF SEATTLE AS FOLLOWS:

 Section 1. A new subsection is added to Section 3.02.120 of the Seattle Municipal Code as follows:

 3.02.120 Powers of Hearing Examiner.

 ***

C. Using resources provided in the annual budget for the normal operation of the Office of Hearing Examiner, the Hearing Examiner may provide hearing examiner services to other public entities not likely to appear before the Hearing Examiner in City of Seattle matters. The Hearing Examiner is authorized, on behalf of the City and without further ordinance, to enter into one or more contracts with other public entities, whether pursuant to RCW 39.34.080 or otherwise, under which the Hearing Examiner will provide, and the City of Seattle will be compensated for, those services. Before entering into any contract under this subsection, the Hearing Examiner shall obtain the advice of the City Attorney and the Risk Manager as to the contract's provisions for liability and indemnification. The compensation called for in each contract shall be established by the Hearing Examiner as he or she deems appropriate in each instance, but shall always be designed, at a minimum, to recover the Hearing Examiner's marginal costs of performing the services. The Hearing Examiner is authorized to accept all monetary compensation received under these contracts for deposit in the General Subfund.

Section 2. This ordinance shall take effect and be in force thirty (30) days from and after its approval by the Mayor, but if not approved and returned by the Mayor within ten (10) days after presentation, it shall take effect as provided by Municipal Code Section 1.04.020.

 Passed by the City Council the ____ day of _________, 20__, and signed by me in open session in authentication of its passage this _____ day of __________, 20__.
