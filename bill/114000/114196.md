 ACCEPTANCE OF A GRANT

 AND

 THE IMPLEMENTATION OF IMPROVEMENTS TO LOWER WOODLAND PLAYFIELD

 This Memorandum of Understanding ("MOU") is entered into by and between the City of Seattle ("City") a first class city of the State of Washington, acting by and through its Superintendent of the Seattle Department of Parks and Recreation ("Department"), and the Baseball Club of Seattle, L.P., a Washington limited partnership d/b/a the Seattle Mariners Baseball Club ("Mariners").

 1. RECITALS

 1.1 The Department has jurisdiction over and manages the baseball and softball playing fields and associated facilities at Lower Woodland Playfield (collectively, the "Facilities").

 1.2 Major League Baseball (MLB), through its All Star Legacy Grant program, provides grant funding to host cities of its annual All-Star Baseball Game.

 1.3 Seattle and the Mariners hosted the 2001 All-Star Baseball Game.

 1.4 The All-Star Legacy Grant funds (the "Legacy Grant Funds") are derived from income received by MLB from various activities it conducts during the All-Star Weekend. MLB, through the Mariners, is making the Legacy Grant Funds available to the City for the purpose of renovating and maintaining the Facilities.

 1.5 The Mariners and the Department have agreed that (a) the Mariners will provide the City with the Legacy Grant Funds and (b) the City and the Department shall use the Legacy Grant Funds to improve and maintain the Facilities in the manner described in this Agreement.

 1.6 The Department and the Mariners are entering into this MOU to memorialize the terms and conditions under which the All Star Legacy Grant shall be used for the renovation, use and maintenance of the Facilities.

 2. GRANT OFFER AND FINANCIAL TERMS

 2.1. The Mariners shall provide the Department with the Legacy Grant Funds, in the amount of $1,000,000.00 to support the Project specified in Section 3.2 below. In order to access the Legacy Grant Funds, the Department shall submit invoices to the Mariners for costs incurred and expended for said Project that are consistent with (a) the Plan defined in Section 3.3 and (b) the budget and activities recommended by the Steering Committee defined in Section 3.1. The Mariners shall reimburse and make payment to the Department after receipt of these invoices.

 2.2. The Department will contribute at least $350,000 to the Project (as defined in Section 3.2 below), for the costs of the work described in Exhibit 1 hereto, under "Department Contribution". In the event that the Project encounters unanticipated costs that would exceed the amount of the grant and cause a budget overrun, the Department will use its best efforts to secure the resources needed to complete the Project as intended. If resources are not available, the Department will then work with the Mariners, through the Project Steering Committee (as defined in Section 3.1), on any potential changes and modifications of the scope that are mutually acceptable and will result in completing the Project within budget. The Department also agrees to use its best efforts to secure an appropriation or other funding for field lighting for the Facilities, including all playing fields within the Facilities, to maximize their potential evening use.

 2.3. If the Project is complete and under budget, the Project Steering Committee will review and determine the best use of any excess grant revenues for the Project, including allocating such funds for future maintenance or to additional scope elements that are mutually acceptable.

 3. PROJECT PURPOSE AND SCOPE OF WORK

 3.1 A Project "Steering Committee" consisting of 6 representatives, 3 from each party, shall be established to oversee the renovation of the Facility, evaluate and recommend changes to the Plans, and make recommendation(s) to the Superintendent for the maintenance of the Facility after completion. All recommendations of the Steering Committee shall require a majority vote of all representatives, provided that, in the event of any vacancy, no decision of the Steering Committee shall be effective unless one representative of each party votes with the majority. During construction, the Department will provide the Steering Committee with monthly progress reports and regular updates about any changes to the Project. The Steering Committee, as a whole, shall meet bi-monthly to discuss and propose a resolution for any issues that may arise from these reports and updates during the planning, construction, and completion of the project.

 3.2 The purpose for MLB's and the Mariners' granting of the Legacy Grant Funds to the City is to develop, renovate, use and maintain the Facilities to a quality level that is higher than the level applied for the creation and/or maintenance of any other dedicated baseball fields under the care of the City, so that the Facilities will be established as the best quality baseball playfields in the City, be at least at the quality level expected for tournament level fields and serve as the showcase for baseball and softball play within the City. The Department agrees to maintain the Facilities at this level of quality until otherwise recommended by the Project Steering Committee. Without limitation to the foregoing standards, in no event will the City fail to take any action necessary to maintain all available warranties associated with the products used to construct and operate the Facilities. The development, renovation and maintenance of the Facilities shall be referred to in this Agreement as the "Project". The Legacy Grant Funds will be used for solely for carrying out the Project in accordance with the purpose of the grant and the terms of this agreement.

 3.3. The Facilities will be developed and renovated consistent with the plans and schedule (collectively, the "Plans") that are attached to this MOU as Exhibit 2. Major modifications may be made to the Plans, including the schedule, and to the scope of work contained in the Plans, but only by mutual agreement of the parties. The Department will provide timely notification to the Mariners of such potential major modifications and, if not scheduled, a Project Steering Committee Meeting will be convened to discuss the proposal.

 4. PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION AND PROGRAMMING OF FACILITIES

 4.1. The Department shall be the primary party responsible for the planning, design, and implementation of the Project in accordance with the agreed upon Plans, including the hiring of a contractor through the city's public works bidding process.

 4.2. The Steering Committee may consider and recommend to the Superintendent alternative contracting arrangements to develop the Project, including having the Mariners assume this role that may provide cost savings or other operational advantages.

 4.3. Youth leagues and teams will be granted priority use of the fields, consistent with Departmental policy and applicable laws. The playing fields within the Facilities shall permit baseball and softball use only, and to the maximum extent possible consistent with maintenance concerns, shall be available for this purpose on a year- round basis. The Department's Recreation Information Office (RIO) will be responsible for scheduling the use of the fields.

 5. MAINTENANCE RESPONSIBILITIES

 Following completion of construction, the Department will maintain the Facilities consistent with the purposes described in Section 3.2 above.
