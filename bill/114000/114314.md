 ORDINANCE _________________

 AN ORDINANCE relating to land use and zoning, amending the list of sign kiosks authorized in subsection 23.55.015E of the Seattle Municipal Code

 WHEREAS, the purposes of the Sign Code are to allow signs that invite rather than demand the public's attention, to encourage the use of signs that enhance the visual environment of the city, and to protect the public interest and safety; and

 WHEREAS, the Sign Code authorizes signs that are in the public interest, such as on-premises signs; and

 WHEREAS, allowing additional messages, including noncommercial messages and off-premises messages of interest to the community, on sign kiosks will promote the public interest by allowing new opportunities for communication within the community where a sign kiosk is located; and

 WHEREAS, Ordinance 120388 adopted findings supporting amendments to the Sign Code to allow sign kiosks to provide opportunities for communicating information of community interest, subject to development standards, and also found to be lawful twenty-three sign kiosks erected or planned for before the effective date of Ordinance 120388; and

 WHEREAS, two additional proposed sign kiosks were planned for by the City before the adoption of Ordinance 120388, and these kiosks will also be consistent with the policies for allowing sign kiosks; and

 WHEREAS, these two proposed sign kiosk structures have been analyzed and found not to pose undue risks with respect to traffic hazards, as documented in the report from Seattle Transportation in CF 305387; and

 WHEREAS, these two proposed sign kiosks have been analyzed and approved with respect to the design principles governing new kiosks by the Seattle Design Commission, as documented in memos from the Seattle Design Commission in CF 305387; and

 WHEREAS, these proposed sign kiosks are likely to be effective in promoting community communication because the communities requesting them have demonstrated support for them in their neighborhood plans; NOW, THEREFORE,

 BE IT ORDAINED BY THE CITY OF SEATTLE AS FOLLOWS:

 Section 1. Subsection 23.55.015 E of the Seattle Municipal Code is amended by adding two sign kiosks to the list of sign kiosks authorized in Ordinance 120388 Attachment 2: at Mapes Creek Plaza, 52nd Avenue South, between S.
