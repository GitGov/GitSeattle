This shall include but not be limited to commercial use: ~~A~~1 in determining the weight, measurement, or count of commodities or things sold, or offered or exposed for sale, on the basis of weight or of measure, ~~B~~2 in computing the basic charge or payment for services rendered on the basis of weight or measure, or ~~C~~ 3 in determining weight or measurement when a charge is made for such determination; provided, that with respect to single-service devices, that is, devices designed to be used commercially only once and to be then discarded, and with respect to devices uniformly mass- produced, as by means of a mold or die, and not susceptible of individual adjustment, the inspection and testing of each individual device shall not be required and the inspecting and testing requirements of this section will be satisfied when inspections and tests are made on representative sample lots of such devices; and the larger lots of which such sample lots are representative shall be held to be correct or incorrect upon the basis of the results of the inspections and tests on such sample lots.

 B. The City Sealer shall have the power to inspect and test, to ascertain if they are correct, all electronic pricing systems, as often as necessary to secure compliance with this code. Electronic pricing systems will be inspected following procedures contained in National Conference on Weights and Measures (NCWM) Publication 19 Examination Procedure for Price Verification (August 1995) as revised.
