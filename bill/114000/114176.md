 ORDINANCE _________________

 AN ORDINANCE relating to Law, Safety, and Justice Information Technology initiatives; creating a position in the Seattle Police Department to act as the Project Director for the replacement of multiple public safety projects in the Police and Fire Departments; reducing an appropriation in Finance General and reappropriating that amount; and ratifying and confirming prior acts; all by a three- fourths vote of the City Council.

 WHEREAS, the City's 2002 Capital Improvement Program includes a project to replace a variety of major information technology systems in the City's Law, Safety, and Justice (LSJ) departments, including the Police Department's Computer Aided Dispatch (CAD) and Records Management (RMS) systems and the Fire Department's CAD and RMS systems; and

 WHEREAS, as the City has begun work on these major efforts, the interdependencies among these four projects have become increasingly apparent, as has the need for dedicated full-time staff for the effort; and

 WHEREAS, it has been determined by the Police and Fire Departments, with the City's Chief Technology Officer concurring, that there is a need for a single, full-time, Project Director to oversee all four efforts to ensure that the projects are undertaken and implemented in a coordinated and integrated fashion; and

 WHEREAS, it has been agreed between the Police and Fire Departments that while the position will be housed in the Police Department, it is understood that the position will provide leadership for all four projects; and

 WHEREAS, funding is available within the project budget from funds set aside in Finance General (program Q5188909) to support such a position until the Police and Fire CAD and RMS projects have been fully implemented; Now, Therefore,
