Alternatively, the Executive Director may arrange with the appropriate King County officials, on terms satisfactory to the Executive Director and consistent with this Chapter, for the contents of the City's election pamphlet to be included in a pamphlet published and mailed by King County pursuant to RCW Chapter 29.81A. The pamphlet shall contain:

 1. For each measure, the identification by serial number, the ballot title, the text, an explanatory statement, and arguments for and against the passage of the measure;

 2. The photographs and campaign statements of the candidates for the offices of Municipal Court Judge, City Councilmember and City Attorney, and the Mayor, whose names are listed on the ballot;

 3. Information from other jurisdictions which participate in the pamphlet;

 4. A sample ballot;

 5. Information about election laws of participating jurisdictions, qualifications for voting, voter registration, obtaining and using an absentee ballot or an application for an absentee ballot; and

 B. The Executive Director shall determine, among other matters, the organization, size, dimensions, format, and the layout of the pages of the pamphlet subject to the guidelines in this chapter. Whenever applicable, the election pamphlet shall comply with the provisions of RCW Chapter 29.81A and RCW Chapter~~s 29.80 and~~ 29.81 regarding the publication of the State candidates' and voters' pamphlets. The Executive Director is authorized to produce and make publicly available the election pamphlet in electronic format.
