 ORDINANCE __________

 AN ORDINANCE relating to the Law Department's community prosecution program; authorizing the acceptance of grant funds awarded through the Awards for Planning, Implementing, and Enhancing Strategies in Community Prosecution program of the United States Department of Justice; authorizing the execution of an agreement with the United States Department of Justice for financial assistance in the total amount of One Hundred Fifty Thousand ($150,000); accepting the money when received; increasing the 2002 Budget of the Law Department by making a reimbursable appropriation; adding positions (one of which will be exempt and both of which will sunset with the end of the grant); and ratifying and confirming prior acts; all by a three- fourths vote of the City Council.

 WHEREAS, the Law Department since 1995 has operated a Precinct Liaison Program, wherein assistant city attorneys assist in neighborhood public safety and community livability problem-solving efforts; and

 WHEREAS, the Precinct Liaison Program enjoys broad support from the police, the community, and other entities engaged in community problem-solving efforts within Seattle, and

 WHEREAS, the Law Department successfully used a previous grant from the United States Department of Justice, under the Awards for Planning, Implementing, and Enhancing Strategies in Community Prosecution grant program, to enhance the Precinct Liaison Program in April 2000 by placing a full-time, precinct-based liaison in the West Precinct and adding a half-time administrative support position to assist all of the liaisons; and

 WHEREAS, the Law Department used its existing budget resources and positions to create a second full-time, precinct-based liaison split between the East and South Precincts in August 2000; and

 WHEREAS, the grant-created positions sun-setted with the end of the previous grant in December of 2001; and those positions were supported within the existing positions and budget of the Law Department thereafter; and

 WHEREAS, the Law Department applied for and was awarded a new federal grant on April 29, 2002 under the same grant program for fiscal 2002 that would permit further enhancement of the existing Precinct Liaison Program by: adding an additional full-time, precinct-based liaison to be split between two precincts, adding an additional half-time administrative support position, and providing funding for necessary technology purchases and travel costs required by the grant; and

 WHEREAS, the acceptance of this grant will also permit a second precinct to benefit from the services of a full-time, precinct-based liaison; and

 WHEREAS this expansion will increase capacity and access to legal liaison services for the Police, other City Departments, and citizens engaged in community problem solving efforts as well as permit an evaluation of the program's results; and

 WHEREAS, the City Attorney desires to execute an agreement with the United States Department of Justice accepting the award of grant funds; Now, therefore

 NOW THEREFORE,
