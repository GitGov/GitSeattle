 NOW, THEREFORE,

 BE IT ORDAINED BY THE CITY OF SEATTLE AS FOLLOWS:

 Section 1. The Mayor or the Director of the Office of Economic Development ("OED Director") is authorized, on behalf of The City of Seattle, to lend and cause the disbursement of up to Two Million Forty Thousand Dollars ($2,040,000) from the proceeds of the City's Replacement Note, a copy of which is filed in Clerk's File 306584, to Historic Seattle Preservation and Development Authority, a Washington public authority chartered by the City ("Obligor"), pursuant to the Loan Agreement authorized in Section 2 of this ordinance, to finance the acquisition of the real property ("Property") at 319 Second Avenue South in the Pioneer Square neighborhood. The Mayor or the OED Director is further authorized, on behalf of The City of Seattle, to cause there to be drawn from the federal treasury and deposited in the Special Purpose Grants Fund, No. 17820, companion Brownfields Economic Development Initiative ("BEDI") Grant funds in the amount of Two Hundred Thirty Thousand Three Hundred Twenty-Three Dollars ($230,323), and pursuant to the appropriation in Section 4 of this ordinance, to cause the disbursement of such amount for the benefit of Obligor, for the purposes of reducing or subsidizing interest obligations on the Section 108 loan. The amount of such BEDI Grant funds is based on the ratio of the maximum amount of the Section 108 loan ($2,040,000) to the maximum proceeds of the City's original Section 108 note and Replacement Note (i.e., $15,500,000).

 Section 2.

 (A) The Mayor or the OED Director is authorized, on behalf of The City of Seattle, to execute, deliver, administer and cause to be performed: (1) a Loan Agreement with the Obligor based on the form attached as Exhibit B to this ordinance and the terms outlined on pages 2 and 3 of the Loan Proposal attached as Exhibit C to this ordinance, with such additions and modifications as HUD may require or the Mayor or OED Director may deem necessary or advisable to carry out the purposes of this ordinance; and (2) such amendments and related documents as the Mayor or OED Director may deem necessary or advisable to carry out the purposes of this ordinance. The Section 108 loan shall be secured by one or more deeds of trust, in form and content acceptable to the OED Director, against the Property and against other property of Obligor. Each such deed of trust may be subordinated to one or more other mortgages or deeds of trust. The provisions for security shall be designed with the intent that, upon reduction of senior mortgage debt from completion of tax credit equity financing, there will be a loan-to-value ratio no higher than 80%, computed at the time of project stabilization (i.e., achievement of a debt service coverage ratio of 1.2) by dividing the total principal amount of debt secured by such senior mortgages and deeds of trust, together with the principal amount of the Section 108 loan, by the total fair market values of all such properties (or the interests therein subject to the City's deeds of trust, as applicable). The Section 108 loan shall also be recourse to Obligor.

 (B) Without limiting the authority in this Section, the Mayor and OED Director is each authorized: (1) to allow the Obligor to grant a master lease of the Property, and convey all rights in the building thereon, to Cadillac Rehabilitation LLC, subject to the City's deed of trust; (2) after substantial completion of rehabilitation of the Property, and in order to facilitate a sale of the Property or an interest therein to the federal government, to cause the City's deed of trust on the Property to be released and reconveyed in whole or in part, and to accept modified or substitute security in the Obligor's or Cadillac Rehabilitation LLC's remaining interests in the Property, or both, provided that the Mayor or OED Director determines in his or her judgment that the City will have security satisfying the 80% loan- to-value limit at the time of project stabilization; and (3) to amend the loan terms, in connection with any conversion of the Replacement Note or a portion thereof to fixed rates, so that BEDI Grant funds or accumulated reserves from Obligor payments, or both, may be made available to reduce effective interest obligations of the Obligor after such conversion, on such terms and conditions as the Mayor or OED Director may negotiate.

 Section 3. The Loan Agreement shall provide, consistent with HUD regulations, that the Obligor shall take affirmative steps to assure that minority and women's business enterprises are used when possible, that Obligor shall maintain records of those steps, and that nothing in the Loan Agreement shall be construed to require or authorize any discrimination or preferential treatment contrary to applicable law.

 Section 4. To the extent that BEDI Grant funds (in addition to BEDI Grant funds previously received and disbursed under Ordinances 120873 and 121201), are received by the City in the Special Purpose Grants Fund, the appropriation for the following in the 2004 Budget is increased from the fund shown, as follows:

 Fund Department Budget Control Level Amount

 Special Office of Economic 6XD20 $230,323 Purpose Development (BEDI Grant Grants funds) Fund, No. 17820

 Section 5. The Amendment to Contract for Loan Guarantee Assistance between the City and HUD dated as of August 21, 2003, and the issuance of the Replacement Note, each is hereby ratified and confirmed. The revised maturity schedule for the combined original Section 108 note issued under Ordinance 120873 and the Replacement Note, attached to this ordinance as Exhibit A, is hereby approved. The Mayor or OED Director is further authorized to implement the terms of the Contract for Loan Guarantee Assistance, as so amended, and the Loan Agreement, and to negotiate and execute such additional amendments and agreements and perform such other acts as the Mayor or OED Director deem necessary or advisable to carry out the purposes of this ordinance and to implement the Section 108 loan guaranty. The additional amendments and agreements authorized by this Section 5 shall be in the form and contain such terms and conditions as the Mayor or OED Director may deem necessary or advisable to carry out the purposes of this ordinance.

 Section 6. The Mayor or OED Director may require the Obligor to pay a loan origination fee of no more than one percent (1%) of the loan amount, i.e., no more than Twenty Thousand Four Hundred Dollars ($20,400). Such fee shall be paid directly to the Custodian to be held in trust for the purposes set forth in this Section 6. The OED Director is authorized to cause all of this fee to be disbursed to the National Development Council for consulting services related to the loan authorized hereby, in accordance with the City's existing contract with the National Development Council.

 Section 7. The City's 2004 Action Plan Worktable, as added to its 2001-2004 Consolidated Plan by Ordinance 121318, is amended by replacing the entry for "Cadillac Hotel" with the information on Exhibit D to this ordinance. The Director of the Human Services Department ("HSD Director") is authorized to (a) further amend the City's 2001-2004 Consolidated Plan, including the 2004 Action Plan, to reflect the transactions contemplated by this ordinance and (b) provide OED with technical assistance to ensure compliance with Community Development Block Grant ("CDBG") regulations applicable to the Section 108 loan program. The Mayor, OED Director, and the HSD Director are authorized to take such other actions as they shall deem necessary to implement the actions authorized by this ordinance.

 Section 8. Section 3 of Ordinance 120873 is hereby amended as follows:

 Section 3. The Mayor or OED Director is authorized, on behalf of The City of Seattle, to execute, deliver, administer and cause to be performed Loan Agreements with the Goodman Entities, and with other borrowers to which loans of Note proceeds shall be approved by any later ordinance (the Goodman Entities and any such other borrowers are collectively referred to as "Obligors"), each based on the form attached as Exhibit F, or such other form as may be authorized by ordinance, with such additions, modifications, and amendments as HUD may require or the Mayor or OED Director may deem necessary or advisable to carry out the purposes of this Ordinance, together with such ancillary and related documents as the Mayor or OED Director may deem necessary or advisable to carry out the purposes of this Ordinance. Such modifications may include, without limitation, provision for an interest rate payable by each Obligor that may be at a rate higher than or different from that interest rate payable on the Note; provisions establishing, adjusting or eliminating a periodic monitoring fee or a similar fee payable by the Obligors, or both. Each loans to an Obligor shall be secured by a first lien position deed of trust, in form and content acceptable to the OED Director, against the property being acquired and improved with such loan. The loans to the Goodman Entities shall also be secured by an unconditional guaranty of payment and performance from John A. Goodman in form and content acceptable to the OED Director. Moreover, the Loan Agreements shall provide, consistent with HUD regulations, that the Obligors shall take affirmative steps to assure that minority and women's business enterprises are used when possible, and shall maintain records of those steps, and that nothing in the agreement shall be construed to require or authorize any discrimination or preferential treatment contrary to applicable law. Disbursement of such loan proceeds for the costs of renovation of each Obligor's project to be funded from proceeds of the Note shall be governed by a construction disbursement agreement for the benefit of the City in form and content acceptable to the OED Director.

 Section 9. This ordinance is not intended to create, and shall not be construed to create, any contractual or otherwise binding obligation upon, or commitment by, the City for the benefit of Obligor, Cadillac Rehabilitation LLC or any other party interested in the acquisition or rehabilitation project. The commitments to the Obligor authorized by this ordinance, subject to the limitations herein and under applicable law, shall become effective only if and when the agreements authorized hereby are duly executed and delivered by the City and other necessary parties.

 Section 10. Project Advisory Committee. There is hereby established a Project Advisory Committee ("Committee") for the Cadillac Hotel Building redevelopment project ("Project"), with the composition, functions and duties set forth in this Section.

 (a) Purposes; Advisory Capacity.

 (c) Meetings.

 (f) Dissolution of Committee.

 Section 11. Any act pursuant to the authority and prior to the effective date of this ordinance is hereby ratified and confirmed. If any provision of this ordinance is determined to be invalid or unenforceable the remainder shall nonetheless remain in full force and effect.

 Section 12. This ordinance shall take effect and be in force thirty (30) days from and after its approval by the Mayor, but if not approved and returned by the Mayor within ten (10) days after presentation, it shall take effect as provided by Municipal Code Section 1.04.020.

 LOAN AGREEMENT

 THIS LOAN AGREEMENT (as supplemented or amended from time to time, and including all documents and terms incorporated herein by reference, the "Agreement"), dated as of __________, 2004, is entered into by and between HISTORIC SEATTLE PRESERVATION AND DEVELOPMENT AUTHORITY, a Washington public corporation (hereinafter called "HSPDA" or "Obligor") and THE CITY OF SEATTLE, a Washington municipal corporation (hereinafter called "City").

RECITALS

 This Agreement is entered into upon the basis of the following facts and circumstances:

 A. Obligor will purchase the real property described in Attachment A, attached hereto and made a part hereof by this reference (the "Property"), from Cadillac Preservation LLC, a Washington limited liability company controlled by HSPDA that acquired the Property in November 2002. Obligor will use the proceeds of the Loan (described in Section 1.1 below) to purchase the Property. Obligor intends to cause the rehabilitation of the Property as part of an economic development project described in Attachment B, attached hereto and incorporated herein by this reference (the "Project"). In order to implement such Project the Obligor intends to grant a long-term ground lease or master lease on the Property ("Ground Lease") to Cadillac Rehabilitation LLC, a Washington limited liability company ("LLC") of which Obligor is the managing member.

 B. The United States Department of Housing and Urban Development ("HUD") has agreed to guarantee a non-recourse note or notes (as supplemented or amended from time to time, and together with any replacements thereof issued by the City and guaranteed by HUD pursuant to the HUD Contract described below, the "City Note") issued by City in part to fund the Loan, in accordance with Section 108 of the Housing and Community Development Act of 1974, as amended (such Act and the federal regulations promulgated thereunder are hereinafter collectively called the "Act"). As of the date hereof, the City Note is a Variable/Fixed Rate Note, no. B-02-MC-53-0005 in the maximum commitment amount of $7,484,000, which is one of two notes that are the subject of a Contract for Loan Guarantee Assistance between the City and HUD (as amended by an Amendment dated August 21, 2003 and as it may be further supplemented or amended from time to time, the "HUD Contract") and certain Letter Agreements for Section 108 Guarantee Program Custodial Account (as supplemented or amended from time to time, the "Letter Agreements") among the City, HUD and JPMorgan Chase Bank (hereinafter referred to, with any successors under such agreement or successor agreement, and in its capacity as trustee in connection with the BEDI Grant Reserve Account, as "Custodian"). City has also entered into an Indenture of Trust and Custodial Agreement with the Custodian (as supplemented or amended from time to time, together with any substitute therefor in accordance with Section 7.2 below, the "Custodial Agreement"), which provides for, among other things, the Custodian to hold certain security for the City Note on behalf of HUD and for the establishment and management of certain accounts pursuant to the HUD Contract and Letter Agreements. The HUD Contract is entered into pursuant to an application submitted to HUD by the City dated June 18, 2002, a copy of which Obligor has received and reviewed (as supplemented or amended from time to time, the "Application"). The Application, HUD Contract, Letter Agreements and Custodial Agreement are incorporated herein by this reference. Unless the context otherwise provides, capitalized terms used herein and not otherwise defined shall have the meanings assigned to them in the HUD Contract or City Note, as applicable.

 C. The Office of Economic Development of the City ("OED") is responsible within The City of Seattle for making, subject to City Council approval, loans of funds obtained from HUD by pledges of Community Development Block Grant ("CDBG") funds to be made available to the City by HUD, pursuant to the Act. Unless the City otherwise notifies Obligor, in writing, the OED shall be responsible for performance of the obligations of the City under this Agreement and the other Loan Documents, and for oversight of performance of such agreements by Obligor, and references hereinafter made to the City shall be deemed to mean the City, acting through OED. The Director of OED, or his or her duly authorized designee, and any official of the City succeeding to the functions of such Director, is referred to herein as the "OED Director."

 D. The Loan shall be evidenced by this Agreement and by Obligor's Promissory Note ("Obligor Note") in the form attached hereto as Attachment C and hereby incorporated by reference, and together with Obligor's other obligations under the Loan Documents, secured by a Deed of Trust, Assignment of Leases and Rents and Security Agreement with Fixture Filing in the form and content acceptable to the City (as supplemented or amended from time to time, and together with any other assignments of leases, tenant estoppels, subordination and attornment agreements delivered in accordance with this Agreement, the "Deed of Trust") on the Property, dated on or about the date hereof. The Obligor Note, this Agreement, the Deed of Trust, the Certificate and Indemnity (defined in Section 3.1 of this Agreement), the Dearborn Deed of Trust (defined in recital E below) and any other documents or instruments executed by Obligor in favor of City pursuant hereto, are collectively referred to herein as the "Loan Documents". Where the context so requires, to the extent that the Loan Documents provide that Obligor's obligations or duties thereunder are determined by reference to any terms or provisions of documents incorporated by reference in any of the Loan Documents, any reference to the "Loan Documents" shall include such terms or provisions.

 E. The Obligor's obligations under this Agreement and the other Loan Documents shall be further secured by a deed of trust granted by HSPDA ("Dearborn Deed of Trust") on certain real property located at 1117 Minor Avenue, Seattle, WA ("Dearborn House") and by the assignment of any additional collateral as required by the provisions of this Agreement or by HUD. Moreover, the loan shall be recourse to HSPDA.

 F. The portion of principal on the City Note that is scheduled to become due and payable in any year, equal to that portion of principal on the Obligor Note scheduled to become due in the same year, is referred to as the "Corresponding Advance" to such portion of principal on the Obligor Note, and the aggregate of all Corresponding Advances is referred to as the "Corresponding Portion" of the City Note.

 G. In order to stabilize, to the extent described herein, Obligor's effective interest obligation with respect to the Loan at a rate equal to four and one-half percent (4.5%) per annum, the City will transfer funds in the maximum aggregate amount of Two Hundred Thirty Thousand Three Hundred Twenty-Three Dollars ($230,323), derived solely from a BEDI Grant made by HUD for such purposes, to the Custodian, for deposit into a reserve account (the "BEDI Grant Reserve Account") to be established at Closing and held as a pledged account securing repayment of the Loan and City Note, subject to application as an interest subsidy on the Loan from time to time.

 NOTICE: ORAL AGREEMENTS OR ORAL COMMITMENTS TO LOAN MONEY, EXTEND CREDIT, OR TO FORBEAR FROM ENFORCING REPAYMENT OF A DEBT, ARE NOT ENFORCEABLE UNDER WASHINGTON LAW.

 NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing Recitals and the covenants, conditions, representations and warranties contained herein, the parties hereto agree as follows:

As a condition to any disbursement hereunder the OED Director may require that Obligor, the seller and NPS shall have executed and delivered such amendments, assignments and such other documents as the City may require to establish the final terms of the NPS Agreements in a manner satisfactory to the OED Director and to ensure the ability of the City to protect its security upon completion of the sale thereunder.

ARTICLE IV - LOAN DISBURSEMENTS AND REPAYMENTS; RESERVE ACCOUNTS

 4.1 Initial Disbursement to Finance Property Acquisition. Conditioned upon receipt of proceeds of the City Note and satisfaction of all other applicable conditions to Loan disbursements under this Agreement, Loan funds in the amount of Two Million Forty Thousand Dollars ($2,040,000), less any fee charged by HUD or the Fiscal Agent for such disbursement, shall be disbursed on the date (the "Closing Date") of closing of the acquisition of the Property (the "Closing"), to be applied to the costs of acquisition of the Property, related Closing costs, the Loan fee payable to the City in accordance with Section 1.5 of this Agreement, and other fees and costs due and payable at Closing pursuant to Section 1.6 of this Agreement. To the extent that final information as to any costs payable by Obligor hereunder is not available at the time of Closing, the City may instruct the closing agent or Custodian to hold back a reasonable amount, as determined by the City, to cover such costs when known, and after such costs have been determined and paid, to disburse any remainder first to the Obligor to reimburse any eligible acquisition or Closing costs paid by Obligor from other funds, and then the residue, if any, to the Loan Repayment Account.

 4.2 Reserved.

 4.3 Costs Related to Public Offering. On the Closing Date, the amount of  N/A/ Dollars ($ N/A/ , out of the City Loan proceeds, shall be held in the Guaranteed Loan Funds Account established by the Custodian under the Letter Agreements ("Guaranteed Loan Funds Account"), for the purpose of paying the costs to be incurred in connection with the Public Offering, including without limitation trustee's fees and underwriters' fees and costs. Such funds shall nonetheless be considered Outstanding under the Obligor Note. After the Conversion Date, upon payment of all of such fees and costs allocable to the City Note, any remaining amount in the Guaranteed Loan Funds Account shall be transferred to the Loan Repayment Account maintained by the Custodian under the Letter Agreements ("Loan Repayment Account"), and the next deposit(s) required to the Loan Repayment Account in respect of principal under Section 4.6 below shall be reduced, dollar for dollar, by the amount of such transfer. In any event all amounts remaining in the Guaranteed Loan Funds Account on  N/A/  shall be transferred to the Loan Repayment Account unless otherwise agreed by HUD and the City. If the Obligor Note shall be paid in full prior to the Conversion Date, the amount so withheld, and earnings thereon, shall be applied as part of such prepayment of the Obligor Note and transferred to the Loan Repayment Account to redeem the City Note. The City may elect, in its sole discretion, to waive the foregoing requirement upon receipt of evidence satisfactory to the City that the payment of such costs has otherwise been duly provided for and that funds necessary to pay such costs will be available when needed. If no funds are held back pursuant to this Section then Obligor shall deliver to the Custodian, by the later of the date ___ days prior to the date set for a Public Offering that will include the City Note, or __ days after the date of notice thereof to Obligor, the Obligor's prorata share of Public Offering costs as determined by the City or Custodian based on information from HUD. If Obligor does not timely deliver such amount, then the City may direct the Custodian to pay the Obligor's share of Public Offering costs from any of the Reserve Accounts, any other provision of the Loan Documents notwithstanding, and the Obligor shall replenish such Reserve Account(s) on demand.

 4.4 Request for Interim Funding Advance; Cancellation upon Failure to Satisfy Closing Conditions; Payment of City's Costs. Obligor understands that, pursuant to current HUD procedures, an interim funding advance on the City Note can be made only on a Wednesday and only if a request for such advance is made by the City to HUD consistent with the timing requirements of the Fiscal Agency Agreement and with any additional advance notice that HUD may require, and that after a request has been submitted it may not be possible to cancel the request. The Obligor shall deliver to the City, no later than fifteen (15) Business Days prior to the Wednesday on which Obligor desires an advance of funds hereunder, an "Obligor's Request for Submission of City's Request for Interim Advance of Funds" in form acceptable to the City. The City shall not be required to submit a request for funds to HUD unless the City has received reasonable assurance that all other conditions to closing will be satisfied by the date of disbursement by HUD. If the City does submit a request for funds to HUD, the City shall not be liable or responsible for any failure or delay by HUD, the Fiscal Agent or the interim purchaser of the City Note, or for any delay in the process of transferring funds to the Custodian and to the escrow agent. If Obligor submits such request and funds are disbursed by HUD on the City Note, but the conditions to disbursement of funds to Obligor are not fully satisfied within fifteen (15) days thereafter, then the City shall have the right to cancel this Agreement, and Obligor shall then pay on demand all fees and costs of the Custodian and Fiscal Agent, and shall reimburse the City for all reasonable fees and costs of its outside counsel and consultants incurred in connection with this Loan, but shall not be liable for the Loan fee described in Section 1.5 of this Agreement. In addition, if this Loan Agreement shall be canceled under this Section after proceeds of the City Note shall have been disbursed to the Custodian, then the Obligor shall pay to the Custodian on demand an amount equal to all interest that shall accrue on the Corresponding Portion of the City Note from the date of such disbursement to the date of redemption thereof, less net earnings actually received (if any) by the Custodian on the proceeds of the City Note prior to such redemption.

 4.5 Reserved.

 4.6 Loan Repayment Account.

 (a) Monthly Deposits. Commencing in the first month disbursement of principal of the City Note in respect of the Obligor Note is to be made, Obligor shall make monthly installment payments to the Custodian for deposit in an account maintained by the Custodian for the accumulation of funds for payments on the Obligor Note (the "Loan Repayment Account," established under the Custodial Agreement and Letter Agreements), in order that the Custodian shall have sufficient funds to pay installments on the Obligor Note as they come due (each such due date being an "Obligor Note Payment Date"). Obligor shall pay to the Custodian on each Deposit Day, the Interest Component and the Principal Component, each for deposit into the Loan Repayment Account. Funds in the Loan Repayment Account shall be used to make payments on the City Note as they come due. Each such monthly deposit shall be due and payable, in immediately available funds, on the "Deposit Day," which shall be the fifteenth (15th) day of the month, or if such day is not a Business Day, then on the previous Business Day; subject to adjustment in respect of any Conversion Date. Subject to the provisions of Section 4.6(b) hereof, the Interest Component payable each month shall be in an amount equal to the interest accrued and to accrue on the Obligor Note during that entire calendar month, except that the Interest Component shall be adjusted ratably in any month the Loan is not outstanding for the entire month. The amount, if any, by which an Interest Component deposit made prior to the Conversion Date, or made after any Involuntary Conversion (as defined in Section 1.3 hereof), exceeds the amount of interest accruing in the same calendar month on the Corresponding Portion of the City Note, is an "Interest Stabilization Payment." Each Principal Component shall be one-twelfth (1/12th) of the total principal coming due on the Obligor Note on the next Obligor Note Payment Date, except adjusted ratably during any period that fewer than twelve (12) Deposit Days are scheduled to occur prior to the corresponding Obligor Note Payment Date in respect of principal of the Obligor Note. Except as provided in Section 4.6(b) below, Obligor shall not be entitled to any reductions in, or credits against, deposits to the Loan Repayment Account based upon interest or earnings credited to the Loan Repayment Account, the Loan Repayment Investment Account or the BEDI Grant Reserve Account. The Obligor hereby irrevocably assigns all of its right, title and interest, if any, in funds deposited in the subaccounts of the Loan Repayment Account, Loan Repayment Investment Account and BEDI Grant Reserve Account related to the Obligor Note, to the Custodian and the City, and shall have no residual interest in any portion of such Reserves.

 (b) Interest Stabilization Payments and Subsidy. Unless the Custodian shall have delivered to Obligor and City a Shortfall Notice (defined in this Section, below), the Interest Component to be deposited by Obligor on any Deposit Day prior to the Conversion Date, or after any Involuntary Conversion, shall not exceed the interest that would accrue on the Obligor Note during the month in which such Deposit Day falls if all amounts of principal bore interest at four and one-half percent (4.5%) per annum. If the actual amount of interest payable on the Obligor Note on an Obligor Note Payment Date prior to the Conversion Date, or after any Involuntary Conversion, is greater than the total of the amounts required as Interest Components under this subsection on the Deposit Days since the preceding Obligor Note Payment Date, the Custodian shall look to other funds on deposit in the Loan Repayment Account, the Loan Repayment Investment Account and the BEDI Grant Reserve Account to pay the balance of interest next scheduled to become due on the City Loan; provided, that the Custodian shall exhaust funds on deposit in the Loan Repayment Account and the Loan Repayment Investment Account from time to time prior to making any withdrawals from the BEDI Grant Reserve Account to pay any portion of the difference between the Interest Component of any monthly deposit and the amount of interest accruing on the Obligor Note in the same month; and provided further, that Custodian is not authorized to and shall not withdraw from the BEDI Grant Reserve Account for such purposes, an aggregate amount greater than Two Hundred Thirty Thousand Three Hundred Twenty-Three Dollars ($230,323) plus the investment earnings, if any, on that amount actually deposited in the BEDI Grant Reserve Account as a reserve related to the Obligor Note, as such amount may be reduced from time to time under the terms of this Section. If not less than five (5) Business Days prior to any Deposit Day the Custodian determines that there shall or may be insufficient funds available in the Loan Repayment Account, the Loan Repayment Investment Account and the BEDI Grant Reserve Account to pay the full amount of principal and interest to become due on the Corresponding Portion of the City Note on the next date such interest is required to be paid, taking into account the expected payment of interest at a deemed rate of four and one-half percent (4.5%) per annum required to be made by Obligor on such Deposit Day and each subsequent Deposit Day scheduled to occur prior to the corresponding Obligor Note Payment Date, the Custodian shall promptly deliver written notice (each, a "Shortfall Notice") to that effect to the Obligor (with a copy to the City). After receipt of any such Shortfall Notice, on or before each Deposit Day, the Obligor shall pay to the Custodian, for deposit into the Loan Repayment Account, as the Interest Component, the full amount of interest actually accruing on the Loan and Obligor Note during the corresponding month, unless and until the Custodial shall give notice that there are again sufficient funds from Interest Stabilization Payments, if any, such that the Shortfall Notice is no longer in effect. Obligor acknowledges and agrees that Interest Stabilization Payments made by Obligor in accordance with Section 4.6(a) and deposited in the Loan Repayment Account, together with the earnings thereon, if any, and any BEDI Grant funds, and earnings thereon, in each case to the extent not required to be applied pursuant to this subsection (b), shall be the property of the City, free and clear of any claim of Obligor, whether or not retained by the Custodian as a reserve for the City Note. After the Conversion Date, unless there shall have been an Involuntary Conversion and unless otherwise agreed in writing by the City, (1) the City shall have no obligation whatever to cause the application for the benefit of Obligor of any funds derived from Interest Stabilization Payments or any remaining amounts in the BEDI Grant Reserve Account; and (2) the then remaining balance of Interest Stabilization Payments and earnings thereon, whether or not transferred on the books of the Custodian, shall be deemed transferred to a Loan Loss Reserve and shall not be considered part of the Loan Repayment Account for purposes of subsection 4.6(c) below.

 (c) Transfers Authorized; Crediting Payments on Obligor Note . The Custodian is hereby irrevocably authorized to transfer from the Loan Repayment Investment Account to the Loan Repayment Account on each Obligor Note Payment Date, funds in the full amount due on the Obligor Note on each such date, and from the BEDI Grant Reserve Account, the amounts described in Section 4.6(b). The Custodian is then authorized and directed to apply funds in the Loan Repayment Account to the timely payment of amounts due on the Corresponding Portion of the City Note. The Obligor further agrees that upon direction of the City, the Custodian may apply funds in the BEDI Grant Reserve Account to make any payments on the Obligor Note for which there are insufficient funds in the Loan Repayment Account as a result of failure by Obligor to pay funds to the Custodian for deposit therein as required hereunder, but no application of any funds in any account to payments on this Note shall waive or reduce any such required payments from Obligor. Obligor's monthly installment payments into the Loan Repayment Account shall not constitute payments under the Obligor Note. Obligor shall be credited with the payment of interest and principal on the Obligor Note only when and solely to the extent that funds on deposit and/or transferred to the Loan Repayment Account under this Section 4.6(c), not including any amounts in the Loan Loss Reserve, are applied to the payment of the Corresponding Portion of the City Note. The Custodian is further irrevocably authorized by Obligor to liquidate investments in the Loan Repayment Investment Account and BEDI Grant Reserve Account, in the Custodian's discretion, and without liability for any loss on any such liquidation, for the purposes described in this Section 4.6(c). The authorization by Obligor in this Section 4.6(c) is in addition to, and not in limitation of, the authorization in Section 1.4 above.

 (d) Investment of Funds; Earnings Remain on Deposit. Funds in the Loan Repayment Account and BEDI Grant Reserve Account shall be invested at the direction of City, but only in instruments that mature (or are redeemable without penalty) within six (6) months and in any event no later than five (5) Business Days before the next Obligor Note Payment Date, and that are guaranteed as to payment of principal by the United States Government, or in money market funds that invest solely in such instruments. All earnings in the Loan Repayment Account and BEDI Grant Reserve Account shall remain therein until applied in accordance with this Agreement, or until all amounts owing under the Loan Documents have been paid in full, or in the case of the BEDI Grant Reserve Account, until any earlier date when any right of the Obligor to have amounts in such Account applied for its benefit shall have terminated hereunder. When all amounts owing under the Loan Documents have been paid in full, then the remaining balance shall be disbursed to or upon the order of the City.

 (e) Late Charge. If any deposit required to be made into the Loan Repayment Account is not received within ten (10) days after the date when such deposit is due, in addition to additional interest required to be paid in accordance with the Obligor Note, Obligor agrees to pay a late charge equal to five percent (5.0%) of the amount past due, as compensation to the City and Custodian for the staff time and resources required to handle such delinquencies, and not as a penalty. Such late charges shall not be credited to the Loan Repayment Account, but shall be retained by the City and/or Custodian. Late charges under this Section are in addition to, and not in substitution for, the other remedies provided in the Loan Documents.

 4.7 Application of Payments. Any amounts to be applied to the Obligor Note in accordance with this Agreement shall be applied first to accrued interest on the Obligor Note, next to any premium then due, and the balance, if any, to reduction of principal.

Obligor shall ensure compliance with the provisions of 24 CFR Section 570.611, which provide generally that no officer, agent, employee, consultant or elected or appointed official of The City of Seattle, or of a designated public agency, or of any subrecipient receiving CDBG funds, who exercises or has exercised any functions or responsibilities with respect to activities assisted by CDBG funds or who is in a position to participate in a decision-making process or gain inside information with respect to these activities, shall obtain any financial interest or benefit from, or have any financial interest in, the activity funded under this Loan Agreement or any contract or subcontract or agreement with respect thereto or the proceeds thereof, for himself or herself or those with whom he or she has business or immediate family ties; nor shall (s)he for one year after completion of his or her tenure with the City or such subrecipient obtain or have any such financial interest or benefit. Obligor shall incorporate in all such contracts or subcontracts a provision prohibiting any conflict of interest prohibited by this subsection.

 (d) Debarred Contractors. No portion of the Loan shall be used directly or indirectly to employ, award contracts to, or otherwise engage the services of, or fund, any contractor or subrecipient during any period of debarment, suspension, or placement in ineligibility status of such contractor or subrecipient under the provisions of 24 C.F.R. Part 24. Obligor represents and warrants that neither Obligor nor its principals is debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, declared ineligible, or voluntarily excluded from participation in federal assistance programs under such regulations or Executive Order 12549, "Debarment and Suspension." Obligor shall obtain, and shall require contractors and subcontractors to obtain, the certification required by appendix B of 24 CFR part 24 from each prospective contractor or subcontractor on the Project.

 (e) Lobbying. Obligor hereby certifies and agrees as follows, in accordance with 31 U.S.C. Section 1352, to the best of its knowledge and belief:

 (1) No Federal appropriated funds have been paid or will be paid, by or on behalf of Obligor, to any person for influencing or attempting to influence an officer or employee of any agency, a member of Congress, an officer or employee of Congress, or an employee of a member of Congress in connection with the awarding of any Federal contract, the making of any Federal loan, the entering into of any cooperative agreement, and the extension, continuation, renewal, amendment, or modification of any Federal contract, grant, loan, or cooperative agreement;

 (2) If any funds other than Federal appropriated funds have been paid or will be paid to any person for influencing or attempting to influence an officer or employee of any agency, a member of Congress, an officer or employee of Congress, or an employee of a member of Congress in connection with this Federal loan, it will complete and submit Standard Form-LLL, "Disclosure Form to Report Lobbying," in accordance with its instructions; and

 (3) It will require that the language of this Section be included in the award documents for subawards at all tiers (including subcontracts, subgrants, and contracts under grants, loans and cooperative agreements) and that all subrecipients shall certify and disclose accordingly.

 This certification is a material representation of fact upon which reliance was placed when this transaction was made or entered into. Submission of this certification is made a prerequisite for making or entering into this transaction by section 1352, title 31, U. S. Code. Any person who fails to file the required certification shall be subject to a civil penalty of not less than $10,000 and not more than $100,000 for each such failure.

 (f) Davis-Bacon and Related Acts. Obligor shall comply with any and all applicable requirements of the Davis-Bacon Act and related acts. These requirements include, but are not limited to: language within each contract for construction work; payment of prevailing wages and fringe benefits; the submittal of various documents as evidence of compliance; withholding of funds; equal employment opportunity; and work hours.

 The requirements are defined in the: Davis-Bacon Act, 40 U.S.C. Section 276(a) et seq.; Contract Work Hours and Safety Standards Act, 40 U.S.C. Section 328 et seq.; Copeland Act (Anti-Kickback Act), 18 U.S.C. Section 874; the Fair Labor Standards Act, and regulations under such Acts, including 29 C.F.R. Parts 3 and 5. If under other applicable law or any other agreement with respect to the Project, minimum levels of wages or benefits are required, then Obligor shall ensure compliance with such levels, and if both Davis-Bacon Act requirements and any other such requirements shall apply, then Obligor shall ensure compliance with higher of the applicable levels.

 (g) Economic Opportunities for Low- and Very Low-Income Persons. Obligor shall comply, and cause all contractors and subcontractors to comply, with any and all applicable provisions of Section 3 of the Housing and Urban Development Act of 1968, as amended, 12 U.S.C. 1701u, the purpose of which is to ensure that employment and other economic opportunities generated by Federal financial assistance for housing and community development programs shall, to the greatest extent feasible, be directed toward low- and very low-income persons, particularly those who are recipients of government assistance for housing. Obligor shall comply, and shall require all contractors and subcontractors to comply, with all applicable provisions of regulations issued pursuant thereto by the Secretary of HUD and set forth in 24 C.F.R. Part 135, and with all applicable rules and orders of HUD issued thereunder.

 (h) Relocation and Acquisition. Obligor represents, warrants and agrees that no residential tenants have been or will be displaced in connection with the Project and the Obligor has taken and shall take all reasonable steps to minimize the displacement of persons (families, individuals, businesses, nonprofit organizations, and farms) in connection with the Project. If the Obligor or its affiliate has acquired or entered into an agreement to acquire real property for the Project, then Obligor represents and warrants that prior to making an offer for such property, (1) Obligor or such affiliate clearly advised the owner in writing that it lacked the power of eminent domain and therefore was unable to acquire the property in the event negotiations failed to reach an amicable agreement, and (2) it informed the owner in writing of what Obligor or such affiliate believed to be the fair market value of the property. Obligor represents and warrants that Obligor has provided to City a complete and accurate list of all occupants of the Property as of the date that Obligor obtained site control, and Obligor shall provide a complete and accurate list of all persons occupying the Property at any time after site control and through the date of full occupancy after Project completion. Obligor shall comply fully, at Obligor's sole expense, with the City's Residential Anti-displacement and Relocation Assistance Plan ("RARAP"). If the Project involves the temporary and/or permanent displacement of persons, Obligor represents, warrants and agrees that Obligor has provided and shall provide, at a minimum, all relocation assistance required by 24 CFR Section 42; the federal Uniform Relocation Act and regulations thereunder, 49 CFR Part 24; 24 CFR Section 570.606 and any other applicable federal laws or regulations, and shall maintain complete and accurate records demonstrating such compliance. Obligor agrees that any determination by City of the amount of relocation assistance due to any person shall be final and binding upon Obligor, unless a different determination is made by HUD at the request of such person, in which case the HUD determination shall be final and binding on Obligor. Obligor agrees that the City may, at its option, provide relocation assistance directly to any person in connection with the Project and that any payment by the City for such person shall, at City's option, constitute an advance on the Loan, without any requirement for a draw request by, or consent of, Obligor. If, as a result of any such direct payments, the amount advanced by City shall exceed the maximum Loan amount stated herein, then the excess shall be immediately due and payable by Obligor to City, at City's demand. Obligor represents and warrants that, except as expressly stated in a relocation plan submitted by Obligor to City in connection with this Loan, no residential tenants have been required to vacate or will be required to vacate the Property permanently because of the Project. Obligor shall carry out the terms of any relocation plan approved by City, but the terms of any such plan shall not limit Obligor's obligations under this Loan Agreement or applicable laws or regulations, and no such approval by City shall be construed as a waiver or modification of any requirement of this Agreement or applicable laws or regulations.

 (i) Architectural Barriers. Obligor shall ensure that the Property, upon completion of the Project, shall comply with the applicable requirements of the Architectural Barriers Act of 1968 (see 42 U.S.C. Sections 4151-57), and shall comply with the Uniform Federal Accessibility Standards (Appendix A to 24 CFR part 40 for residential structures, and Appendix A to 41 CFR part 101-19, subpart 101-19.6, for general type buildings).

 (j) Flood Insurance Protection. If the Property is in a special flood hazard area as identified by the Federal Emergency Management Agency, then Obligor represents, warrants and agrees that flood insurance is and shall remain in effect, at Obligor's expense, in accordance with Section 102(a) of the Flood Disaster Protection Act of 1973 (42 U.S.C. Section 4001), so long as any amount is outstanding on the Obligor Note.

 (k) Records. Obligor shall maintain and make available to the City and HUD all records reasonably required to demonstrate compliance with all of the requirements of this Agreement, for at least four (4) years after full repayment of the Loan.

 (l) Disclosures. Obligor represents, warrants and agrees that it has provided to the City any and all disclosures required by the HUD Reform Act, 42 U.S.C. Section 3545, and regulations thereunder, 24 CFR Part 4; that it will provide timely updated disclosures to OH to the extent required by such act and regulations; and that all such disclosures are and shall be complete and accurate.

 (m) Prior Actions. Obligor represents and warrants that in all actions related to the Project to date Obligor and each of its affiliates involved in the acquisition of the property, each has complied with all requirements referred to in this Section 5.7.

 (n) Actions of LLC. Obligor shall ensure that, to the extent the rehabilitation and operation of the Property, and related agreements and activities, are carried out or entered into by LLC, the LLC shall comply with all applicable federal requirements referred to in this section 5.7, and shall maintain and provide to the City or HUD promptly on request documentation of such compliance.

 (o) Indemnity. Obligor shall indemnify and hold harmless the City from any loss, damage, expense, claim or demand resulting from Obligor's failure to comply with, or to ensure the LLC's compliance with, any federal requirement to be complied with pursuant to this Agreement or failure to maintain adequate records to demonstrate such compliance. This provision shall survive expiration of this Agreement.

 5.8 Reports. Obligor shall deliver to the City reports and information as City may require for purposes of monitoring and evaluating the performance of the Obligor, which may include copies of tenant certifications, rent rolls, leases, property management agreements and any other contracts affecting the Property.

 5.9 Liens or Claims of Liens. Obligor shall keep the Property free from liens and encumbrances of all kinds, superior or inferior to the Deed of Trust, except for those permitted pursuant to Section 2.4 above and any of the following:

 (a) Liens for property taxes on the Property not yet due and payable;

 (b) The rights of tenants as tenants only under leases entered into in the ordinary course of Obligor's operation of the Property and in accordance with this Agreement and the other Loan Documents, but only to the extent that such leases are subordinate to the lien of the Deed of Trust, to the Leases (as defined herein), and to any other material leases, which subordinate status shall be insured by endorsement to the City's title insurance policy, at Obligor's expense, within thirty (30) days of request to Obligor by the City; and

 (c) Liens subordinate to the lien of the Deed of Trust, created after the date of Closing with the prior written consent of the OED Director, in his or her discretion.

 If any claims of lien shall be asserted against the Property other than as permitted by this Section, Obligor, regardless of any action that City may otherwise be authorized to take, shall obtain a release and satisfaction of such lien claim, bond the lien claim, procure title insurance satisfactory to City protecting City from any loss relating to such lien claim, or otherwise provide to City assurances and security satisfactory to City that the lien claim will be paid or satisfied not later than ten (10) days after a judgment on the lien claim. Provided Obligor complies with the previous sentence, Obligor may in good faith contest any worker's or material supplier's lien in legal proceedings that will prevent enforcement of the lien claim and prevent foreclosure of the Property. If such a lien claim is not released or satisfied or a bond or other security satisfactory to City provided within forty-five (45) days of written request from City to Obligor, then the failure to do so shall allow the City to declare an Event of Default (as defined in Section 6.1 below) regardless of whether such lien claim is or is not superior to the Deed of Trust.

 Nothing in this Section shall be construed to imply that property of a public corporation may be subject to a statutory mechanic's or materialmen's lien or other involuntary lien, nor be construed as consent by Obligor or the City to any such lien.

 5.10 Political Activity. No portion of the Loan shall be used for any political activity or to further the election or defeat of any candidate for public office or to influence the approval or defeat of any ballot issue or legislation.

 5.11 Further Actions. Obligor will at any time and from time to time upon request of City take or cause to be taken any action, execute, acknowledge, deliver or record any further documents, opinions, or other instruments or obtain such additional insurance as City is required to do or obtain by HUD or other federal, state or county regulatory agency.

 5.12 Other Agreements. Obligor shall fully comply in a timely manner with all other agreements for the financing of the Project, including without limitation construction loans, bridge loans, and equity investment contracts ("Other Agreements"), and to the extent that any Other Agreements are the obligations of the LLC, the Obligor shall ensure that the LLC complies in a timely manner with the terms thereof, but nothing in this Section shall be construed to waive, or excuse noncompliance with, and provisions of this Agreement or any applicable City ordinances or permits. Obligor shall timely satisfy, and shall ensure that the LLC timely satisfies, all conditions under any Other Agreements to the receipt of funding for the Project and for the conversion of construction or temporary financing to a term loan.

 5.13 Payment of Compensation of Custodian. Obligor shall be responsible for and pay its prorata portion of the fees of the Custodian as provided under the Custodial Agreement. The Custodian's acceptance fee, prorated first annual fee and counsel fees and expenses shall be disbursed to Custodian from the Guaranteed Loan Funds Account at the time of initial Loan disbursement. Thereafter, Obligor shall promptly pay the Custodian's fees and expenses directly to the Custodian.

 5.14 Payment of Other Indebtedness. Obligor shall timely pay the principal, interest and all other amounts due on any other indebtedness or liability now or hereafter owing by the Obligor to any person and secured by the Property; provided, that nothing in this Section shall authorize Obligor to make any payment from any funds or assets pledged to the City hereunder.

 5.15 Transfer of Property. Obligor shall not cause or permit any transfer of the Property or any interest of Obligor or LLC therein, voluntary or involuntary, without the advance written consent of the City, except for the creation of liens, encumbrances or leases that are expressly permitted under the Loan Documents without the City's consent.

ARTICLE VI - DEFAULT AND REMEDIES

 6.1 Events of Default. Upon the occurrence of any of the following events and prior to the complete cure thereof by Obligor in a manner satisfactory to the City, the City shall have the right to declare an Event of Default hereunder, without notice or demand by City, except as expressly provided in this Section:

 (a) Any failure to pay when due any deposit into the Loan Repayment Account in respect of principal or interest on the Obligor Note;

 (b) Any failure to make a payment or deposit of money required by any of the Loan Documents, other than amounts referred to in Section 6.1(a) above, that is not cured within ten (10) days of the due date of such payment or deposit (or within ten (10) days of demand in case of amounts due on demand);

 (c) Any transfer of the Property or any interest therein, voluntary or involuntary, contrary to Section 5.15 of this Loan Agreement;

 (d) Any failure to comply with the terms of Section 5.9 of this Loan Agreement (relating to lien claims) within the time period permitted by such Section;

 (e) Any breach or nonperformance by Obligor of any provision of any of the Loan Documents not included within any of Subsections (a)- (d) above that is not cured within sixty (60) days after notice to Obligor of such breach or nonperformance, or such longer cure period as may be permitted under the specific terms of the Loan Document; provided, however, that unless HUD shall otherwise require, if (1) such breach or nonperformance is susceptible to cure but cannot reasonably be cured within such cure period, (2) Obligor shall commence to cure such breach or nonperformance within such cure period and shall thereafter diligently and expeditiously proceed to cure the same, and (3) Obligor shall inform the City in writing of the status of the cure at the expiration of such cure period and every thirty days thereafter, then such cure period shall be extended for such time as is reasonably necessary for Obligor in the exercise of due diligence to cure such breach or nonperformance;

 (f) A petition in bankruptcy or for reorganization or for an arrangement under any bankruptcy or insolvency law or for a receiver or trustee for any of Obligor's property is filed by Obligor, or is filed against Obligor and is not dismissed within ninety (90) days, or if Obligor makes an assignment for the benefit of creditors or becomes insolvent or unable to pay its debts as they mature or any attachment or execution is levied against a substantial portion of the property of Obligor and is not discharged within ninety (90) days, or if any law or court order shall require the City, Custodian or any other party to refund or otherwise relinquish any portion of any amount paid under the Obligor Note or this Agreement as a preference or for any other reason except refund of duplicative payment;

 (g) Any representation, warranty or disclosure made to City by Obligor, or contained in any information submitted by Obligor to City or to any government agency in connection with the Loan or the Property, proves to be materially false or misleading as of the date when made or reaffirmed, whether or not such representation or disclosure appears in this Agreement;

 (h) Any default by Obligor of its obligations under the Certificate and Indemnity, giving effect to any applicable notice and cure provisions thereunder;

 (i) Any default under the Dearborn Deed of Trust that shall not be cured within 30 days after notice thereof by the City.

 6.2 Declaration of Event of Default. City's declaration of an Event of Default hereunder shall be made by notice to Obligor pursuant to Section 7.15 of this Agreement and shall be effective as provided therein.

 6.3 Remedies.

 (a) Upon declaring an Event of Default, City may, in addition to any other remedies which City may have hereunder or under the Loan Documents or by law, at its option and without prior demand or notice take any or all of the following actions:

 (1) Immediately terminate any further advances of Loan funds hereunder and revoke any instructions to any third party holding any such funds;

 (2) Declare the Loan immediately due and payable in full;

 (3) Foreclose under the Deed of Trust, judicially or nonjudicially;

 (9) Seek judicial appointment of a receiver.

 (b) All remedies of City provided for herein and in any other Loan Documents are cumulative and shall be in addition to all other rights and remedies provided by law. The exercise of any right or remedy by City hereunder shall not in any way constitute a cure or waiver of default hereunder or under any other Loan Document or invalidate any act done pursuant to any notice of default, or prejudice City in the exercise of any of its rights hereunder or under any other Loan Documents unless, in the exercise of said rights, City realizes all amounts owed to it under such Loan Documents.

 6.4 No Default Prior to Declaration. No default or Event of Default shall exist under this Agreement or the Obligor Note until the same shall have been declared by the City or other party authorized to make such declaration; provided, that failure to declare, or delay in declaring, a default hereunder shall not constitute a waiver of any rights or remedies or excuse any failure by Obligor to strictly comply with its obligations under all of the Loan Documents.

ARTICLE VII - MISCELLANEOUS

 7.1 No Waiver. No waiver of any noncompliance or breach by Obligor hereunder shall be implied from any failure by City to take action on account of such noncompliance or breach, and no express waiver shall affect any breach or noncompliance other than as specified in the waiver. Any waiver shall be operative only for the time and to the extent therein stated. Waivers of any covenant, term or condition contained herein shall not be construed as a waiver of any subsequent breach of the same covenant, term or condition. The consent or approval by City to, or of, any act by Obligor requiring further consent or approval shall not be deemed to waive or render unnecessary the consent or approval to, or of, any subsequent similar act.

 7.2 Successors and Assigns; Delegation to Custodian; Changes in Custodian and Custodial Agreement. This Agreement is made and entered into for the sole protection and benefit of City, HUD, and Obligor, their successors and assigns, and no other person or persons shall have any right of action hereunder. The terms hereof shall inure to the benefit of the successors and assigns of the parties hereto; provided, however, that the Obligor's interest hereunder cannot be assigned or otherwise transferred without the prior written consent of City. Obligor acknowledges and agrees that City may assign to HUD or any custodian or trustee for HUD any or all of City's rights under this Agreement and any of the Loan Documents and may direct that any payment or performance be provided directly to HUD or such custodian or trustee, whether or not the Obligor Note or this Agreement have been assigned. Obligor agrees that City may delegate to the Custodian the right to make demands and give directions on behalf of City under the Loan Documents, but that the scope of any such delegation shall be strictly limited to the terms of a written instrument duly signed on behalf of the City. Obligor further acknowledges that the Custodial Agreement may be modified or terminated, or a substitute Custodial Agreement executed, or a successor Custodian appointed, in each case without the consent of Obligor so long as the obligations of Obligor are not increased and the rights of the Obligor under the Loan Documents are not adversely affected in any material respect. Except for minor modifications to the Custodial Agreement not affecting Obligor, City agrees to give reasonable advance notice to the Obligor of any action as described in the preceding sentence, and agrees in each case to provide a copy of any modification or substitute Custodial Agreement to Obligor within fifteen (15) days after the execution thereof.

 7.3 No Defense Based on City Regulatory Actions. Obligor understands that (a) the operations of Obligor in the Property and elsewhere are subject to numerous laws, regulations, ordinances and permits, including those of City and other governmental bodies relating to land use, environmental hazards, and other regulatory matters, and (b) the modification, interpretation, application, or revocation of such laws, regulations, rules or permits could adversely affect economic return to Obligor from the Property. Obligor has conducted its own investigation and relied on the advice of its own counsel and experts as to all such matters in connection with Obligor's acquisition of the Property. Obligor acknowledges that by entering into this Agreement the City does not make, and that the City expressly disclaims, any representation or assurance whatever as to (1) the present or future status of the Property or the uses thereof under applicable laws or regulations, including those of the City; or (2) the availability, issuance or continuation of any permits, approvals, or interpretations of any kind that may be required or desired by Obligor or any other party in connection with the Property. Obligor agrees that notwithstanding any regulatory action or omission of City affecting Obligor or affecting the use or development of the Property (whether or not such action or omission shall be determined to be consistent with applicable law in any proceeding), no defense, offset or reduction of liability shall be available to Obligor, at law or in equity.

 7.4 Time. Time is of the essence of all provisions of the Loan Documents.

 7.5 Entire Agreement; Amendments. This Agreement, the other Loan Documents, and the documents, laws and regulations incorporated by reference herein constitute the entire agreement of the parties hereto with respect to the Loan and supersede any prior agreements or understandings, written or oral, with respect to the Loan. Obligor is not relying upon any promises, representations or understandings, written or oral, in entering into the Loan Documents, other than as expressly set forth in the Loan Documents. The obligations of Obligor under the Loan Documents are not conditioned upon, and shall not be affected by, any other agreement, understanding, performance or nonperformance by the City or any other party, and in any proceeding to enforce any of Obligor's obligations under the Loan Documents, Obligor shall not be entitled to assert, by way of excuse, offset, counterclaim, grounds for equitable relief, or otherwise, any actual or alleged action or inaction by or on behalf of the City except to the extent that any such action or inaction is expressly required of the City by, and is made a condition of Obligor's obligation by, the Loan Documents. No amendment, modification, or termination of any provisions of this Agreement or of any of the Loan Documents shall in any event be effective unless the same shall be in writing and signed by a duly authorized officer of City and by Obligor, and no such writing shall be construed to modify, waive, or affect the terms of the Loan Documents except to the extent that such document expressly so provides.

 7.6 Headings. The article and section headings in no way define, limit, extend or interpret the scope of this Agreement or of any particular article or section.

 7.7 Number and Gender. When the context in which the words are used in this Agreement indicate that such is the intent, words in the singular number shall include the plural and vice-versa. References to any one gender shall also include the other gender if applicable under the circumstances.

 7.8 Validity. In the event that any provision of this Agreement shall be held to be invalid, the same shall not affect in any respect whatsoever the validity of the remainder of this Agreement.

 7.9 Governing Law. This Agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of Washington, and The City of Seattle, except to the extent federal law applies.

 7.10 Survival. All agreements, representations and warranties made herein and in the Obligor Note shall survive the execution and delivery of this Agreement and of the Loan Documents and the making of the Loan hereunder and continue in full force and effect until the obligations of Obligor hereunder and the indebtedness evidenced by the Obligor Note have been fully paid and satisfied, and thereafter to the extent provided in the Loan Documents, regardless of whether the Obligor Note is surrendered or marked as canceled or paid in full.

 7.11 Venue and Forum. In the event that any legal action should be filed by either party against the other, the venue and forum for such action shall be the Superior Court of the State of Washington for the County of King.

 7.12 Attorney's Fees. In the event either party shall bring an action to enforce the terms and conditions of this Agreement, the prevailing party shall be entitled to recover all of its costs and expenses, including, but not limited to, reasonable attorney's fees as determined by the court.

 7.13 Duplicate Originals; Counterparts. This Agreement shall be executed in duplicate and each of the parties hereto shall receive an original. Each original shall constitute one and the same agreement. This Agreement may be executed in counterparts, and each such counterpart shall be deemed to be an original.

 7.14 Construction. The Loan Documents shall be construed so as to conform to the requirements of the HUD Contract and applicable federal laws and regulations. The Loan Documents are the product of negotiation between the parties and therefore shall not be construed strictly in favor of, or against, either party except as may be specifically provided in the Loan Documents with respect to particular provisions thereof.

 7.15 Notices. Any notice, demand or request required hereunder shall be given in writing at the addresses set forth below by personal service, by facsimile transmission, or by first class mail.

 7.16 Additional Terms and Conditions

 The terms of this Section are intended to be in addition to, and not in substitution for, the terms and conditions set forth above, but in case of any irreconcilable conflict, the terms of this Section shall control. The inability of Obligor to satisfy any condition below for any reason shall not excuse any failure to comply in a timely manner with any other provision hereof. All provisions and conditions in this Section, and all other conditions to disbursement set forth in this Agreement, are for the benefit only of the City (and where applicable, HUD) and may be waived in whole or in part by the OED Director in his or her discretion, but no waiver shall be valid unless in writing signed by the OED Director.

 (a) Obligor shall not cause or permit the commencement of any rehabilitation, construction, demolition or other physical change to the Property (collectively, "Work") prior to all of the following having occurred:

 (i) all plans and specifications for all Work shall have been approved in writing by the Washington State Historic Preservation Officer;

 (ii) all plans and specifications for all Work shall have been approved in writing by the OED Director, in his or her discretion;

 (iii) all plans and specifications as approved pursuant to clauses (i) and (ii) above shall be fully consistent with the terms of the NPS documents;

 (iv) Obligor shall have demonstrated to the satisfaction of the OED Director that the Work will satisfy all conditions necessary in order to qualify for federal historic preservation tax credits and to comply with all requirements of other lenders and with actual or anticipated funding conditions of investors for the provision of equity financing for the Project.

 (b) No later than twenty (20) months after the closing of this Loan ("Permanent Loan Funding Date"), the Obligor shall cause the total debt secured by the deed of trust in favor of Key Bank, N.A. to be reduced to no more than $4,080,000, and shall satisfy all conditions necessary to convert such debt to a term loan of no less than ten (10) years, with payments based on an amortization of at least thirty (30) years, and shall cause any other monetary lien with priority over the City's Deed of Trust to be fully reconveyed of record so that the City's Deed of Trust is a second lien on the Property and the assignment of the lessor's interest in the NPS Space Lease is second only to an assignment to secure such debt owing to Key Bank, and if so required by the City the Obligor shall cause endorsements to the City's policy of title insurance, satisfactory to the OED Director, to be issued at the Obligor's sole expense, insuring such priority. Notwithstanding the above, if, on the Permanent Loan Funding Date, the total debt in favor of Key Bank exceeds $3,810,000, the amount of such excess above $3,810,000 shall be dedicated by Obligor for debt service and/or operating costs on terms satisfactory to the City.

 (c) No later than the closing date of this Loan , and as a condition to disbursement of Loan proceeds , the Obligor shall have executed and delivered to the City a security agreement, in form and content satisfactory to the OED Director, assigning and pledging to the City the Borrower's rights to receive payments from the LLC in the amount of no less than $460,474, which payments shall be due from the LLC upon its receipt of certain funds from an equity investor, under an agreement or instrument satisfactory to the OED Director, and the Obligor and LLC shall have executed and delivered such documents and provided such evidence as the OED Director shall require, which may include delivery of original instruments and express consent or agreement of the investor, to establish that the City has a first priority perfected security interest in such rights to payment and such remedies as the OED shall require. Such security agreement shall provide that HSPDA shall agree to hold the amount of $460,474 out of repayments from the LLC in a dedicated bank account, as security for the Loan, and to be used to fund costs of the Project to the extent the OED Director may so approve, until the Obligor and LLC shall have achieved such goals, including without limitation stabilized operating income of the Property after rehabilitation, as the OED Director deems adequate.

 IN WITNESS WHEREOF, Obligor and City have executed this Agreement as of the date first written above by and through their duly authorized representatives.

 VARIABLE/FIXED RATE PROMISSORY NOTE

 Seattle, Washington $2,040,000

 _________, 2004

 FOR VALUE RECEIVED, HISTORIC SEATTLE PRESERVATION AND DEVELOPMENT AUTHORITY ("Obligor"), a Washington public corporation, promises to pay to THE CITY OF SEATTLE, WASHINGTON ("Payee"), a Washington municipal corporation, or order, at the time or times provided herein, in lawful money of the United States, the sum of Two Million Forty Thousand Dollars ($2,040,000), with interest as provided herein.

 This Note is given to evidence a loan (the "Loan") made pursuant to the Loan Agreement dated as of _________, 2004 (as supplemented or amended from time to time, the "Loan Agreement"), between the Obligor and the Payee. The funds used by the Payee to make the Loan have been obtained by Payee exclusively through the sale of a note in the maximum commitment amount of $7,484,000 issued by the Payee, a copy of which note, with a schedule of Principal Due Dates as modified by agreement of the City and HUD, is attached hereto as Exhibit 2 and incorporated herein by this reference (as so modified, and including any note issued in replacement therefor or for a portion thereof that includes the amount disbursed in order to fund the Loan evidenced hereby, the "City Note") pursuant to Section 108 of the Housing and Community Development Act of 1974, as amended (42 USC section5308) and 24 CFR 570.700, et seq., pursuant to which the Payee has entered into certain agreements, including, but not limited to, (a) with the United States Department of Housing and Urban Development ("HUD"), a Contract for Loan Guarantee Assistance, as amended ("HUD Contract") which contract incorporates by reference, an Amended and Restated Master Fiscal Agency Agreement between HUD and JPMorgan Chase Bank (formerly known as The Chase Manhattan Bank), (b) with HUD, the BEDI Grant Agreement #B-99-BD-53-0015, and (c) with JPMorgan Chase Bank, an Indenture of Trust and Custodial Agreement (which documents, as amended or amended from time to time, may be referred to collectively as the "Master Agreement"). The Obligor acknowledges and agrees that the Loan is made subject to all of the terms and conditions of the HUD Contract, Master Agreement and the City Note. Any capitalized terms not defined herein shall have the meanings provided in the City Note, the Loan Agreement or the Master Agreement as applicable.

 Each portion of principal outstanding on this Note shall bear interest from the date hereof at the greater of 4.5% per annum or the rate applicable to the Corresponding Advance of principal under the City Note. For each installment of principal shown on Exhibit 1 hereto, the Corresponding Advance consists of an equal amount of principal on the City Note maturing in the same year as such installment of principal hereunder. The "Blended Rate" on this Note for any period is the single rate that, if applied to all installments of principal hereunder for such period, would result in the same amount of interest accruing in such period on the aggregate amount of principal under this Note, as is determined by applying the rates actually applicable to each installment of principal for such period.

 Interest on this Note shall be due and payable on the 15th day of each calendar month next preceding each of the following dates if interest on the City Note is scheduled to become due and payable on such date: February 1, May 1, August 1, and November 1 of each year. The amount of interest payable on this Note on each such 15th day shall include interest accrued through such date and interest to accrue through the end of the month in which the interest payment becomes due under this Note. Interest on this Note also shall be due ___ days before any other date when interest shall become due on the Corresponding Portion of the City Note, and the amount of interest then payable on this Note shall include interest accrued and to accrue up to such date when interest shall become due on the City Note. Interest on the City Note is due and payable quarterly in arrears prior to the Conversion Date, on the Conversion Date, and semiannually thereafter. Principal on this Note is due and payable as set out on Exhibit 1 attached hereto and incorporated herein by this reference. Each date upon which principal or interest, or both, is due and payable hereunder is an "Obligor Note Payment Date."

 The principal amount due under this Note on each Obligor Note Payment Date shall be as set forth on the attached Exhibit 1, except to the extent such principal amount shall have been reduced by prepayment before such Obligor Note Payment Date as provided herein.

 On and after the Conversion Date (whether conversion to a fixed rate or rates is effected with the consent of the Obligor or otherwise), as more fully set forth in the City Note, each Corresponding Advance will accrue interest on the City Note at the fixed rate that the underwriters of the City Note, or securities representing participation interests in a pool of notes guaranteed by HUD, including the City Note, determine will enable them to sell the City Note or such participation interests under then prevailing market conditions as of the Conversion Date at one hundred percent (100%) of the aggregate amount thereof. Conversion to a fixed rate is subject to limitations set forth in the Loan Agreement.

 Notwithstanding the foregoing, following the occurrence of any default hereunder or under the Loan Agreement, which default is not cured as permitted by the Loan Agreement, the outstanding principal balance of the Loan and this Note shall bear interest at the greater of the rate set as provided above or twelve percent (12%) per annum.

 Interest payable on or before the Conversion Date shall be calculated on the basis of a 360-day year and the actual number of days elapsed. Interest after the Conversion Date shall be calculated on the basis of a 360-day year consisting of twelve 30-day months. The period of time over which interest is computed in order to determine the amount payable on any Obligor Note Payment Date is referred to as the "Interest Period" for such Obligor Note Payment Date.

 Anything herein to the contrary notwithstanding, all principal, interest, fees, costs and other charges that Obligor is obligated to pay in connection with this Note and the Loan shall be due and payable, in full, no later than July 15, 2022.

 This Note, together with other obligations of Obligor under the Loan Documents are secured by a Deed of Trust, Assignment of Leases and Rents, and Security Agreement with Fixture Filing (as supplemented or amended from time to time, the "Deed of Trust"), of even date herewith, from the Obligor for the benefit of the Payee. This Note, together with other obligations of Obligor under the Loan Documents, are secured by other collateral, including without limitation security interests in the monies and investments held in certain Reserves established in accordance with the Loan Agreement and Master Agreement, and by an assignment of leases and rents.

 The principal hereof and any interest accrued hereon may be prepaid, subject in the case of principal to approval by HUD of prepayment by the Payee of an equal amount of each respective Corresponding Advance on the City Note, and provided, however, that any prepayment shall be applied to the principal installment(s) with latest maturity unless otherwise agreed in writing by the holder hereof and by HUD, and provided, further:

 (a) On or before the Conversion Date, this Note may be prepaid in whole or in part upon thirty (30) days prior written notice to the Payee and with, and only with, the consent of HUD. Any prepayment of the principal hereof shall be accompanied by all accrued interest thereon to the date of prepayment, and partial prepayments shall be credited against the principal amount last becoming due hereunder.

 (b) After the Conversion Date, Obligor shall give 90 days prior written notice of its intention to make any prepayment. Any prepayment shall be applied to the payments last becoming due under this Note. No partial prepayment shall relieve the Obligor of the obligation to make any future payments due after the date of any prepayment. Any prepayment shall be in an amount not less than the amount which is sufficient to defease the Corresponding Advances on the City Note, as provided in the Master Agreement. If in the event of any prepayment, the Payee incurs any costs, expenses, fees, charges, premiums or losses, the Obligor shall pay such items upon demand in addition to the principal and interest due hereunder.

 Any prepayment by Obligor or any third party, or recovery from the disposition of any collateral, after default shall constitute a prepayment and be subject to all terms and conditions regarding prepayment.

 In the event of any default by Obligor in any term or condition of this Note, the Loan Agreement, the Deed of Trust, the Certificate and Indemnity, or any other document executed in connection herewith, which default is not cured as permitted by the applicable document, the entire principal and accrued interest hereunder shall become immediately due and payable without notice or demand at the option of the holder of this Note. If the entire balance of principal and interest shall be declared due and payable after the Conversion Date, then the Obligor shall pay to the holder hereof, in addition to all other amounts owing, any further amount required in order that the holder is able to fully defease, solely from the payments by Obligor hereunder and without costs to such holder, all of the outstanding Corresponding Advances under the City Note. Obligor acknowledges that such additional amount, if any, is intended to protect the holder hereof from potential loss resulting from the enforcement of the terms hereof after default, and not as a penalty.

 If Obligor is in default under the provisions of this Note, the Loan Agreement, the Deed of Trust, the Certificate and Indemnity, or any other document executed in connection herewith, and Payee or other holder of this Note commences any action to enforce collection hereof or foreclosure under any security document given in connection herewith or therewith, the Obligor agrees to pay all costs and expenses incurred by Payee, including but not limited to Payee's or such holder's reasonable attorneys' fees.

 Demand, protest, and notice of demand and protest are hereby waived, and the Obligor, to the extent authorized by law hereby waives any and all homestead or other exemption rights which otherwise might apply to the obligation evidenced by this Note, and/or any property covered by any security document given in connection herewith.

 The Obligor executes this Note as a principal and not as a surety.

 ORAL AGREEMENTS, OR ORAL COMMITMENTS TO LEND MONEY, EXTEND CREDIT, OR TO FORBEAR FROM ENFORCING REPAYMENT OF A DEBT ARE NOT ENFORCEABLE UNDER WASHINGTON LAW.

 Project Description

 The purpose of this Section 108 proposal is to assist with economic and community development activities in the City of Seattle. The proceeds will be drawn from proceeds of a City non-recourse note issued under the previously approved Contract for Loan Guarantee Assistance with HUD ("Section 108 Loan Fund"). The Cadillac Hotel building will be the fifth loan underthe Section 108 Loan Fund. The previous four, 211 First Avenue, The Buttnick Building, City Loan Building and the Compass Center totaled $9,316,000. This loan is for $2,040,000. The borrower, Historic Seattle will use the loan proceeds to acquire the Property. The BEDI funds in the amount of $230,323 will be used for interest subsidy and a loan loss reserve.

 The Section 108 loan will allow Historic Seattle to acquire the earthquake damaged commercial property known as the Cadillac Hotel. This property will be rehabilitated to house the Seattle headquarters of the National Park Service, the Klondike Gold Rush Museum as well as other commercial enterprises. The Klondike Gold Rush Museum is part of the National Park Service. Prior to the Nisqually Earthquake in February of 2001 the Cadillac Hotel operated as a commercial building housing offices, a restaurant and night club. The building sustained more damage from the February 2001 earthquake than any other building in the Seattle area. Since the earthquake it has remained vacant and unsafe for occupancy. The building's restoration has been of great interest to the City of Seattle and to Historic Seattle both because of its historic status and its historic significance to the Pioneer Square Historic District. The building was listed in the amendments to both the original BEDI and Section 108 applications as a property that the two funds would assist.

 The cost of acquisition and rehabilitation of this building is currently estimated at $8,642,048. The Section 108 funds will be used by Historic Seattle to acquire the property from Cadillac Preservation LLC. Rehabilitation costs for the building will be financed through a combination of bank debt, Historic and New Market Tax Credit equity, and conventional equity.

 Following acquisition and prior to completion of rehabilitation, Historic Seattle will grant a 45 year lease to Cadillac Rehabilitation LLC, an entity managed by Historic Seattle. Cadillac Rehabilitation LLC will receive the private construction financing, contract for the rehabilitation, own the property improvements and lease the building to tenants. In return, Cadillac Rehabilitation LLC will provide payments to Historic Seattle in an amount sufficient, alone or together with additional payments in return for funding from land sale proceeds as described below, to pay Historic Seattle's debt service on the Section 108 loan.

 Following completion of rehabilitation, Historic Seattle will sell the land interest in the property to the National Park Service. The land sale will be subject to the 45 year master lease between Historic Seattle and Cadillac Rehabilitation LLC. The proceeds of the land sale will be contributed or lent by Historic Seattle to Cadillac Rehabilitation LLC for payment of soft costs incurred in the rehabilitation or retirement of interim financing of such costs.

 Cadillac Rehabilitation LLC will sublease approximately 10,855 square feet of space in the basement and first floor of the project to the National Park Service, and an additional 11,432 square feet of space in the second and third floors to other office tenants. The National Park Service may be granted an option to purchase the master leasehold in 8 years following rehabilitation for its then determined fair market value. A chart illustrating the transfers of ownership and lease interests is attached as Exhibit I.

 Section 108 Submission Requirements

 A. Community Development Objectives of the Loan Fund

 The Section 108 Loan Fund was set up to assist in economic and community development lending in Seattle's Brownfield Showcase and Enterprise Communities. In doing so the loan fund furthers the City of Seattle's Economic Development Goals as listed in the City's 2001 - 2004 Consolidated Plan. Within the Economic Development component of the Consolidated Plan is the following objective:

 "Provide operating, grant and loan, and project management support to neighborhood business districts and community based development organizations, and to special projects, so that Seattle has thriving neighborhoods and broadly shared prosperity."

 Stated in the Outcome section of the plan is the expectation that the City of Seattle will directly assist businesses and development projects with Section 108 loans.

 B. Description of how the Proposal meets one of the Criteria in 24 CFR 570.208 - National Objectives.

 The City of Seattle's Section 108 / BEDI loan fund was established to create jobs for low and moderate income persons, provide services to a low income area and/or eliminate conditions of blight. All projects assisted through the fund are to be located within the boundaries of the City of Seattle's federally designated Enterprise Community or within the Brownfield Showcase Community.

 Section 570.208 defines the criteria under which an activity may meet Section 570.200(a)(2), National Objectives. Section 570.200(a)(2) requires that all CDBG activities meet one of three national objectives. These objectives are: 1) benefit to low and moderate income families; 2) aid in the prevention or elimination of slums or blight; and 3) meeting other community development needs having a particular urgency because existing conditions pose a serious and immediate threat to the health or welfare of the community where other financial resources are not available. Each project funded through the Section 108 loan fund will meet one of the National Objectives listed in Section 570.200(a)(2) as detailed in Section 570.208.

 The Cadillac Hotel project will meet the requirements of Section 570.208(a)(4). Section 570.208(a)(4) defines activities that meet the requirements of 570.200(a)(2) through the creation or retention of jobs. The subsection states that to qualify as a job creation or retention activity the project must "create or retain permanent jobs where at least 51 percent of the jobs, computed on a full time equivalent basis, involve the employment of low-and moderate-income persons." Sections 570.208(a)(4)(i) & (ii) specify that to qualify under Section 570.208(a)(4) the jobs created or retained must either be held by or be available to low- and moderate-income persons. Section 570.208(a)(4)(iv) lists minimum standards for the presumption that jobs will be "held by or made available to low- and moderate- income persons." Finally, Section 570.208(a)(4)(iv) and (v) state that if the assisted business is located in a census tract or block numbering area that is part of a Federally-designated Enterprise Community, and if the job is located within that census tract, then the person may be presumed to be a low- or moderate-income person. The project will create at least 45 new permanent jobs, a sufficient number to satisfy the requirements of 570.208(a)(4) and 570.209. Because the Cadillac Hotel is located in Pioneer Square neighborhood and is in a Federally-designated Enterprise Community, the project receives the presumption that new permanent jobs benefit low- or moderate-income individuals.

 C. Eligibility under 24 CFR 570.703

 The Cadillac Hotel project will be eligible under 570.703(i)(1), economic development activities eligible under Section 570.203. Under 24 CFR 570.203 (a) the City can provide assistance for acquisition of real property for economic development projects carried out by public or private nonprofit subrecipients. In addition, these activities will meet the guidelines provided in Section 570.209 (Guidelines for evaluating and selecting economic development projects).

 Section 570.207(a) excludes: buildings or portions thereof, used for the general conduct of government, general governmental expenses and political activities. None of the projects to be assisted with Section 108 proceeds will include buildings used for the general conduct of government, general governmental expenses, nor for political activity.

 Section 108 / BEDI funds will be used for the acquisition of the Cadillac Hotel and will meet the requirements of Section 570.203 (b). Historic Seattle will be considered a subrecipient pursuant to 24 CFR 570.

 D. City's Underwriting Guidelines and Analysis - 24 CFR 570.209

 24 CFR Section 570.209 contains guidelines and objectives for evaluating project costs and financial requirements. While these guidelines and objectives are non-binding, the City of Seattle feels they provide a valuable basis for analyzing loans and therefore uses the framework outlined in Section 570.209 to evaluate economic development projects.

 Pursuant to Section 570.209, the City of Seattle established underwriting guidelines for the $15,500,000 Section 108 fund and has applied such standards for each of the four previous projects for the fund. The City considers the following factors in its underwriting analysis:

 Ability to Repay

 Projects to be funded will have at least a 1.1-projected debt coverage ratio. If the project includes more than a small percentage of its rental income from start-up or financially weak tenants then a higher debt coverage ratio shall be required.

 Collateral

 Projects to be funded should have a loan to value ratio of not greater than 80 percent at project stabilization. This value must be supported by an appraisal prior to funding. If greater than an 80 percent loan to value ratio is proposed, outside collateral sufficient to provide an 80 percent loan to value shall be required. In certain cases outside guarantees may suffice for additional collateral.

 Development Team Capacity and Experience

 Projects to be funded should have a development team that has both the capacity and experience to complete the project as demonstrated by past projects and financial strength.

 Developer / Owner Commitment

 Developer / owner commitment can take many forms. While each project is likely to be different the forms of developer commitment that can be expected include: adequate equity, guarantees of completion, guarantees to fund shortfalls or guarantees of minimum cash flow.

 Character

 Projects to be funded should have developers with good credit histories, demonstrated integrity, and quality references.

 Proposed Costs

 Projects to be funded should have reasonable proposed project costs.

 Commitment of Funds

 Projects to be funded should have commitments of construction and permanent financing.

 Need for Public Assistance

 Projects to be funded should demonstrate a need for public financial assistance.

 1. Ability to Repay

 a. Primary Source of Repayment

 The primary source of repayment for the loan will be payments from Cadillac Rehabilitation LLC to Historic Seattle, funded by project rental income. The operating pro forma, attached as Exhibit VI, shows the building with rental income sufficient to achieve a 1.19 debt coverage ratio projected for the first full year of occupancy and a stabilized 1.2 debt coverage ratio in the second year. This is superior to the City's underwriting guideline of a minimum 1.1 debt coverage ratio as outlined above. Projections for the initial three years of operations are as follows (with a description of later years in the attached Exhibit VI):

 Operating Pro Forma Yr 1 Yr 2 Yr 3

 The building is nearly 50 percent pre-leased on a per square foot basis and over 60 percent pre-leased on a rental income basis. The National Park Service will occupy this space through a signed 20-year lease* and will pay $30 per square foot rent, well above the market rent. As a result, the project will have a very strong tenant providing a reliable and above-market source of rental income. This level of pre-leasing commitment is also significant considering the current condition of the building. Pro forma rents for the remaining 11,432 square feet are $18 per square foot rent with expense income estimated to be $4.75. These rates are within the range of rents for comparable properties in the Pioneer Square neighborhood. As described in the appraisal, attached as Exhibit V, rental rates for comparable properties range from $12 to $28 per square foot. The pro forma includes a 4 percent vacancy rate, but this represents 4 percent vacancy of the overall building rental income. In year 2 (when the project is projected to achieve 1.2 debt coverage, i.e., project stabilization), 4 percent of the overall building rental income will equal an annual vacancy amount of $21,682. Because the National Park Service is a key tenant with no assumed vacancy for its space, the $21,682 vacancy amount applies only to the rental income of the remaining 11,432 square feet ($209,891 at year 2). This represents a vacancy rate of 10.33 percent of the rental income for the remaining 11,432 square feet. The Cadillac Hotel vacancy rate is close to the 12.45 percent average market vacancy rate for Pioneer Square, as described in the appraisal. Upon closer analysis of the appraisal, the 12.45 percent market vacancy rate should be considered even lower due to the fact that the appraisal examined vacancy rates for Class A, B and C office space, with Class B space representing the greatest share of vacancies. Although the appraisal did not examine Class A rehabilitated space separately, it would be reasonable to conclude that Class A rehabilitated space, such as the Cadillac Hotel, would be more desirable and have a lower vacancy rate than the 12.45 percent market vacancy rate.

 * The United States General Services Administration, acting on behalf of the National Park Service, will be the tenant on the lease. A copy of the lease is attached as Exhibit III. The Park Service will purchase the land for $800,000 upon completion of rehabilitation, subject to a 45 lease retained by Cadillac Rehabilitation LLC. A copy of the purchase agreement is attached as Exhibit IV.

 b. Secondary Source of Repayment

 The secondary source of repayment is recourse to the project collateral as discussed later in the section entitled Collateral on page 11.

 c. Tertiary Source of Repayment

 The tertiary source of repayment is the financial strength of Historic Seattle Preservation and Development Authority.

 Analysis of Historic Seattle's financial strength is relevant to determine its capacity to develop and manage project operations, as well as due to the recourse nature of the loan. As discussed in greater detail in the section below entitled Developer/Owner Commitment on page 11, Historic Seattle has strong financial strength to develop and manage project operations, thus providing additional confidence in the ability to repay the loan.

 d. Balloon Payment - Loan Refinancing

 The Key bank loan is due in 10 years though it is amortized over 30 years. The City of Seattle Section 108 loan is due on 2022 with a significant balloon payment. It is anticipated that the lump sum payment will be made through private refinance of the Section 108 loan. Given the principal pay down on each of these loans and the historic increases in rental rates in the Pioneer Square market the City of Seattle does not anticipate the project will have difficulty in refinancing either loan at maturity. The combined loan balances on the Section 108 and Bank loan at maturity of the Section 108 loan will be approximately $3,600,000, representing less than 60 percent of the current appraised value of the building. It is anticipated that the loan to value ratio will improve to an even lower number, due to an appreciation in property value over the 19 year term. Moreover, the building will retain its value, as the leases will mandate that tenants maintain their respective tenant space, and the project will have adequate common area reserves sufficient to maintain common areas and exterior.

 e. Commitment of Funding

 All the sources of construction and permanent financing for the Cadillac Hotel project have been committed. Key Bank National Association will provide a $2,810,000 construction loan and a $3,810,000 permanent loan. Key Community Development Corporation will provide $1,604,737 in tax credit equity and $1,802,369 in construction debt. Impact Capital has committed to make a bridge loan of $500,000. These commitments are attached as Exhibit II. The Impact Capital Bridge Loan will be repaid from the tax credit equity pay-in from Key Community Development Corporation. Also, $460,474 of the total $647,785 Historic Seattle Equity Bridge Loan will be repaid from the tax credit equity pay-in. As a condition of the City of Seattle's loan, the City will have a security interest in the $460,474 repayment as additional collateral. This security interest will be released at the later of project completion or stabilized lease-up (1.2 debt coverage). Given the level of reserves, commissions and tenant allowance, it is anticipated that the building will achieve pro forma occupancy by completion of construction or shortly thereafter and will be able to repay its debt obligations.

 f. Repayment Risks

 The primary repayment risk is achieving lease-up. As discussed above, this risk is mitigated by the fact that the project is 50 percent pre-leased on a square foot basis and 60 percent pre-leased on an income basis. The risk is further mitigated by two additional factors. First, if the project should not be able to achieve break- even lease-up by completion of construction, the lease-up reserve could be accessed for a period of 4.5 months on the vacant space (i.e., portion of the property not pre-leased to the National Park Service). Second, upon construction completion, the funds coming back to Historic Seattle from its Historic Seattle Equity Bridge Loan could be accessed. Together the two reserve sources represent over 2.5 years of projected income on the vacant space.

 2. Collateral

 a. Over the term of the loan, the City of Seattle's Section 108 loan will be secured by three sources of collateral. The borrower will grant a second deed of trust on 319 Second Avenue, Seattle, Washington, known as the "Cadillac Hotel Building" to be converted to a second security interest in a 45 year leasehold including the property improvements held by Cadillac Rehabilitation LLC at completion of construction. The appraised value of the leasehold interest at completion is $6,050,000. The appraisal was completed and dated May 19, 2003. The loan secured by the first deed of trust will be reduced to a balance of $3,810,000 upon receipt by Cadillac Rehabilitation LLC of all permanent financing.

 b. The City's loan will also be secured by a second deed of trust on 1117 Minor, Seattle, Washington, known as the "Dearborn House" to be converted to a first deed of trust upon completion of construction. The property was appraised on October 23, 2003. The appraised value of the fee simple interest in the property is $1,600,000. The current first deed of trust is held by Impact Capital for $500,000 and will be retired before completion of construction.

 c. The City will also have a security interest in Historic Seattle's cash funds totaling $460,474. This represents the amount that Historic Seattle will receive as partial repayment of its $647,785 Historic Seattle Equity Bridge Loan (such partial repayment to be made from tax credit equity). The City will release this security interest at the later of construction completion and lease-up stabilization.

 d. The loan will be recourse to Historic Seattle.

 e. Collateral Coverage

 As indicated below, a deed of trust on the Cadillac Hotel property is not sufficient to achieve the required 80 percent loan to value coverage at project stabilization. If the City relied on the leasehold value of the Cadillac Hotel property alone, the loan to value coverage at project stabilization would be 96.7 percent. The City needs to rely on outside collateral, i.e., deed of trust on the Dearborn House, in order to achieve 80 percent loan to value. Collateral coverage at project stabilization may be described as either loan to value or loan to discounted value.

 Total $7,650,000 $6,120,000 $3,810,000 $2,310,000 .883

 f. Collateral Risks

 Deeds of trust on the Cadillac Hotel property and Dearborn House will provide the required 80 percent loan to value upon lease-up/project stabilization. It is customary underwriting practice to determine loan to value coverage at the time of stabilization. Prior to stabilization, it is customary underwriting practice for a lender to rely on steps to mitigate construction risk and lease-up risk rather than loan to value coverage. The most common construction risk involves the risk of cost overruns and force majeure ("acts of god"). Construction risk for this project will be mitigated by the involvement of a highly experienced development team - Historic Seattle, Rafn (contractor) and Stickney Murphy (architect) (as discussed later in greater detail). The City of Seattle has the right to approve the contractor's guaranteed maximum price contract, has the protection of adequate construction contingencies, has a security interest in Historic Seattle's right to receive partial repayment ($460,474) of its $647,785 Bridge loan, and will have insurance protection. As discussed above, the City will also mitigate lease-up risks by strong pre-leasing involving the Park Service as key tenant, and pro forma rent and vacancy assumptions for the remaining tenant space that are well within the market range as supported by an appraisal. Finally, it should be noted that Historic Seattle has pledged its own offices as additional collateral. This demonstrates considerable commitment on the part of the borrower.

 g. Collateral Liquidation Risk

 Should Historic Seattle default on the loan the City of Seattle will foreclose on its security interests on the Cadillac Hotel property and the Dearborn House. In addition to the collateral, the City has access to the proceeds of a BEDI grant in the amount of $1,750,000. These funds have been allocated on a pro rata basis to serve as interest subsidy and loan loss reserve to Section 108 loans. The funds allocated to the Cadillac Hotel project are $230,323.

 3. Development Team Capacity and Experience

 Historic Seattle Preservation and Development Authority will serve as the project developer. Historic Seattle has more than 25 years experience in historic rehabilitation in the City of Seattle. Historic Seattle has selected the Rafn Company as general contractor. Rafn has an established record of excellence in historic renovation in Seattle since undertaking some of the first historic rehabilitation projects in Pioneer Square over 30 years ago. Stickney Murphy Romine will be the project architect. Stickney Murphy is one of the leading Seattle architectural firms with a specialty in historic rehabilitation.

 Overall the capacity and experience of the development team can only be considered first class. A more detailed description of the development team's capacity and experience is attached as Exhibit VII.

 4. Developer / Owner Commitment

 Historic Seattle is a City chartered public development authority. Its mission is to preserve historic properties. Historic Seattle has committed over 2 years and has invested $647,785 in a bridge loan to Cadillac Rehabilitation LLC for the project. It has also raised $200,000 in additional grant funds for the project. Of the $847,785 total amount, Historic Seattle will commit $387,311 as equity on a permanent basis. For this investment, Historic Seattle will receive a 13.7% internal rate of return ("IRR") - a figure on the low side of average for real estate investment. Moreover, Historic Seattle will defer its entire developer fee to project financing. Without Historic Seattle's commitment this prominent and historic building would have been lost long ago. The developer's commitment is unquestionable.

 Attached as Exhibit VIII are the financial statements of Historic Seattle Preservation and Development Authority for the years ending December 31, 1999, 2000, 2001 and 2002 plus the interim statements ending October 31, 2003. The statements were audited by Ernst Jonson & Company, P.S., certified public accountants.

 For each of the years reviewed Historic Seattle has had revenue in excess of its expenditures. On December 31, 2002 net assets (net worth) exceeded $3,000,000 and had steadily grown over the previous four years. For the most recent year end total revenue was just short of $1,800,000 including grant income of $925,000. Expenses were just over $1,250,000 including depreciation of nearly $150,000. While grant income has been a steady source of revenue, 2002 was an exceedingly successful year. Without grant income Historic Seattle would not have had revenue in excess of expenditures. This has been the case for each of the years reviewed. While Historic Seattle's financial viability can be viewed as in part dependent on its ability to generate grant income, it has been consistently successful at increasing its grant income for each of the years reviewed.

 On the interim statements Historic Seattle shows income at 118 percent of budget while expenses were at 91 percent of budget. Grant income for 2003 was budgeted at $7,500 and currently exceeds $325,000. As of October 31, 2003 Historic Seattle's interim operating surplus was over $270,000.

 Based on the statements reviewed, the City of Seattle feels confident in Historic Seattle's capacity to develop and manage the project.

 5. Character

 Historic Seattle has demonstrated the strength of its dedication to historic preservation in its perseverance in perusing the preservation of this severely damaged building. Its character can be seen clearly in its actions.

 6. Reasonableness of the Proposed Project Costs

 Because of the magnitude of the damage that the building suffered in the Nisqually Earthquake and the need to restore the building according to the Park Service standards for historic preservation, cost comparables are not possible. The proposed budget contemplates the full subordination of the developer fee and the full depletion of Historic Seattle's Save the Buildings Fund. These factors and the experience of the development team will combine to assure a commitment to cost refinement and development efficiencies. The Bank and the City's loan commitments are conditioned on a final guaranteed maximum price contract for development within the proposed budget.

 7. Commitment of Funds.

 All sources of financing have been committed. Once the Section 108 loan is approved the project will begin.

 8. Need for Public Assistance

 The Cadillac Hotel project is a unique commercial development. It was a key historic building in the City of Seattle's first historic district. When it was severely damaged in the Nisqually Earthquake, the City of Seattle's Office of Economic Development, the Pioneer Square community and Historic Seattle Preservation and Development Authority pledged to pursue its restoration, if feasible. Only through a combination of public and private resources has Historic Seattle been able to propose the current development structure and restore the building. The Section 108 loan represents less than 25 percent of the project cost. Nearly one third of the project budget is comprised of equity from Key Community Development Corporation and Historic Seattle. Given the achievable rental rates in Pioneer Square the building could achieve no more commercial debt.

 The Section 108 debt was only possible through Historic Seattle's willingness to pledge its own office building as additional collateral.

 E. A Description of the Pledge of CDBG Grant Revenues

 The City of Seattle understands that if the participants in this Section 108 loan fund fail to make timely payments and the City of Seattle therefore fails to make a required payment on its notes, HUD will deduct that payment from the City of Seattle's CDBG Letter of Credit and in accepting this loan guarantee, the City of Seattle has pledged its CDBG funds and all other applicable grants as security for the guarantee.

 F. Principal Repayment Schedule
