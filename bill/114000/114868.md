 ORDINANCE _________________

 AN ORDINANCE amending Seattle Municipal Code Section 4.24.035, Paid sick leave -- Use, to permit employees to use paid sick leave, with approval, for the non-medical care of their newborn children and the non-medical care of children placed with them for adoption.

 WHEREAS, the family and medical leave program permits employees to take unpaid time off for the non-medical care of newborn children and children placed with employees for adoption, but many employees cannot afford to be absent without pay at a time when their family- related expenses are increasing; and

 WHEREAS, allowing employees to access their accumulated sick leave for this purpose demonstrates the City's support for their successful parenting experience; NOW, THEREFORE,

 BE IT ORDAINED BY THE CITY OF SEATTLE AS FOLLOWS:

 2. An illness, injury, or medical or dental appointment of an officer's or employee's eligible family member as defined by SMC Section 4.04.005A, requiring the absence of the officer or employee from work, or when such absence is recommended by a health care professional.

 B. An officer's or employee's request for paid sick leave may be granted by the appointing authority or a designated management representative when the officer or employee chooses to be absent from work for the:

1.Non-medical care of a newborn child of the officer or employee or his or her spouse or domestic partner; or

2.Non-medical care of a dependent child placed with the officer or employee or his or her spouse or domestic partner for purposes of adoption, including any time away from work prior to or following placement of the child to satisfy legal or regulatory requirements for the adoption.  Paid sick leave used for the purposes contemplated by this subsection must end before the first anniversary of the child's birth or placement.

~~B.~~C. An officer or employee may participate in City- sponsored blood drives as a non-compensated donor without deduction of pay or paid leave balances.

~~C.~~D. 1. Officers and regularly appointed employees shall be eligible for up to five (5) workdays or forty (40) hours, whichever is less, of absence from their usual worksite without reduction in pay or use of paid leave to the extent their absence is medically necessary for the purpose of being a transplant donor, as that term is defined in this subsection. "Transplant donor" means a regularly appointed employee or officer who:

 3. No absence is authorized under this subsection ~~C~~D for tests or for other pre-donation appointments.

 Section 2. This ordinance shall take effect and be in force thirty (30) days from and after its approval by the Mayor, but if not approved and returned by the Mayor within ten (10) days after presentation, it shall take effect as provided by Municipal Code Section 1.04.020.
