 Additional plumbing fixtures installed after relocation for each plumbing fixture

 C. For the purpose of this section, "fixture" means and includes an appliance that is connected with a water, drain, or vent pipe, but a sillcock faucet or hose bibb is not considered a fixture. A sanitary plumbing outlet on or to which a plumbing fixture or appliance may be set or attached ~~is~~shall be construed to be a fixture.

 D. Any person who commenced any work for which a permit is required by this Plumbing Code without first having obtained ~~the~~such permit, shall upon subsequent application for the permit pay double the fee fixed by the schedule of fees for the work in subsections A and B of this section unless it is proved to the satisfaction of the Administrative Authority that the work was urgently necessary and that it was not practical to obtain a permit ~~before~~prior to the commencement of the work. In all such emergency cases, a permit shall be obtained as soon as it is practical to do so, and if there is an unreasonable delay in obtaining the permit, a double fee shall be charged as provided in this Code.

 E. A reinspection fee of ~~Forty~~One Hundred Dollars ~~($40)~~$100) may be assessed for each inspection or reinspection if the portion of work for which inspection is called is not complete or if corrections called for are not made. This subsection does not require inspection fees the first time a job is rejected for failure to comply with this Code, but as controlling the practice of calling for inspection or reinspection.

 Reinspection fees may be assessed if the permit is not properly posted on the work site, the work to be inspected is not under test, for failure to provide access on the date for which inspection is requested, or for failure to make required corrections. Requests for reinspection shall be made in writing upon forms furnished for that purpose, and shall be accompanied by the reinspection fee in accordance with this section. If reinspection fees have been assessed, additional inspection of the work shall not be performed until the required fees have been paid.

 Section 2. This ordinance shall take effect and be in force thirty (30) days from and after its approval by the Mayor, but if not approved and returned by the Mayor within ten (10) days after presentation, it shall take effect as provided by Municipal Code Section 1.04.020.
