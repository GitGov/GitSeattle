 WHEREAS, pursuant to the Original Agreement: (1) the Commission issued its Special Obligation Revenue Bonds, Series 1994 (the "1994 Bonds") in the principal amount of $6,000,000, which were secured by the unconditional obligation of the City to make payments under conditions specified in the Original Agreement; (2) the Commission completed construction of the Pearl Warren Building; and (3) the Commission continues to manage the Pearl Warren Building; and

 WHEREAS, the Commission has the opportunity to refund the Special Obligation Revenue Bonds, 1994, and realize significant debt service savings due to favorable interest rates in the bond market; and

 WHEREAS, in light of the above, refunding the 1994 Bonds with bonds of the Commission secured in the same manner by the City as the 1994 Bonds is in the best interest of the City, the Commission and the citizens of Seattle.

Section 2. Section C.1.a. of the Original Agreement is hereby amended to read as follows:

 a. Payment Obligations. The City hereby unconditionally obligates itself to make payments to the Depository for deposit into the Bond Fund as provided below in amounts sufficient, together with other funds available therefore, to make scheduled payments of principal of and interest on the Bonds, the aggregate principal amount of which shall not exceed $5,500,000~~$6,000,000~~. The City covenants and agrees, for so long as any Bonds are outstanding and unpaid, that each year it will include in its budget and levy an ad valorem tax, within and as a part of the tax levy permitted to cities without a vote of the people, upon all the property within the City subject to taxation, which together with all other moneys of the City that may legally be used and that the City may apply for such purposes, will be sufficient to satisfy its obligation to make payments with respect to the Bonds as provided herein. The registered owners of the Bonds shall be express beneficiaries of this unconditional payment obligation.

Section 3. Section C.3.a of the Original Agreement is hereby amended to read as follows:

Prior to the issuance of the Bonds, the City's Debt Management Policy Advisory Committee shall have a reasonable opportunity to review the dates, terms, conditions, interest rates and other features of said financing and the Commission shall have the obligation to make any changes in the terms and conditions reasonably requested by the City.

Section 4. A new subsection entitled "Notification to Commission" is added to Section E of the Original Agreement, to read as follows:

 16. Notification to Commission. The City shall make reasonable efforts to provide to the Commission any notice that the City makes under 17 C.F.R. Section 240.15c2-12(b)(5)(i)(C)(11) (ratings changes), provided that the City's failure to provide such notice to the Commission shall not result in any responsibility or liability whatsoever to the Commission or any other person or entity, and shall not affect or change in any way the rights, duties and responsibilities of the City or the Commission under this Agreement. This Paragraph (16) does not constitute a part of the City's Undertaking for the benefit of the holders of the Bonds.

Section 5. Ongoing Disclosure. A new Article is added to the Original Agreement entitled "Continuing Disclosure" due to the City being an "obligated person" with respect to the Bonds under the Rule, to read as follows:

Continuing Disclosure.

 A. Disclosure. To meet the requirements of paragraph (b)(5) of United States Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC") Rule 15c2- 12 (the "Rule"), as applicable to a participating underwriter for the Bonds, the City will undertake in this Article (the "Undertaking") for the benefit of the holders of the Bonds, as follows:

 (1) The City will provide or cause to be provided to each nationally recognized municipal securities information repository designated by the SEC in accordance with the Rule (each "NRMSIR"), and to a state information depository, if one is established in the State of Washington and recognized by the SEC (the "SID"), annual financial information and operating data regarding the City of the type included, or incorporated by reference, in the Official Statement, as generally described as follows ("annual financial information"): (i) annual financial statements of the City, prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles applicable to government units (except as otherwise noted therein), as such principles may be changed from time to time and as permitted by State law, which statements will not be audited, except that if and when audited financial statements are otherwise prepared and available to the City they will be provided; (ii) a statement of authorized, issued and outstanding general obligation debt of the City; (iii) the assessed value of the property within the City subject to ad valorem taxation; and (iv) ad valorem tax levy rates and amounts and percentage of taxes collected.

 Annual financial information, described above, will be provided to each NRMSIR and to the SID not later than the last day of the ninth month after the end of each fiscal year of the City (currently, a fiscal year ending December 31), as such fiscal year may be changed as permitted or required by State law, commencing with the City's fiscal year ending December 31, 2004. In its provision of annual financial information, with respect to these obligations, the City may cross- reference to any "final official statement" (as defined in the Rule) available from the Municipal Securities Rulemaking Board ("MSRB") or any other documents provided to each then existing NRMSIR or to the SID.

 (2) The City will provide or cause to be provided to each NRMSIR or to the MSRB, and to the SID, timely notice of a failure by the City to provide required annual financial information on or before the date specified in paragraph A(1) above.

 For purposes of this Undertaking, the term "holders of the Bonds" shall have the meaning intended for such term under the Rule.

 B. Amendment of Undertaking. This Undertaking is subject to amendment after the primary offering of the Bonds without the consent of any holder of any Bond, or any broker, dealer, municipal securities dealer, participating underwriter, rating agency, NRMSIR, the SID or the MSRB, under the circumstances and in the manner permitted by the Rule. The City will give notice to each NRMSIR or the MSRB, and to the SID, of the substance (or provide a copy) of any amendment to the Undertaking and a brief statement of the reasons for the amendment. If the amendment changes the type of annual financial information to be provided, the annual financial information containing the amended information will include a narrative explanation of the effect of that change on the type of information to be provided.

 C. Termination of Undertaking. The City's obligations under the Undertaking will terminate upon the legal defeasance, prior redemption or payment in full of all of the then outstanding Bonds. In addition, the Undertaking, or any provision thereof, will be null and void if the City (i) obtains an opinion of nationally recognized bond counsel or other counsel familiar with the federal securities laws to the effect that those portions of the Rule which require the City to comply with the Undertaking, or any such provision, are invalid, have been repealed retroactively or otherwise do not apply to the Bonds; and (ii) notifies the SID and either the MSRB or each then existing NRMSIR of such termination.

 D. Remedy for Failure to Comply with Undertaking. If the City fails to comply with the Undertaking, the City will proceed with due diligence to cause such noncompliance to be corrected as soon as practicable after the City learns of that failure. No failure by the City (or any other obligated person) to comply with this Undertaking shall constitute a default with respect to the Bonds. The sole remedy of the Commission and of any holder of a Bond will be to take such actions as the Commission or that holder deems necessary and appropriate to compel the City or other obligated person to comply with this Undertaking.

 E. Beneficiaries. This Undertaking will inure to the benefit of the City, the Commission or any holder of the Bonds, and shall not inure to the benefit of or create any rights in any other person.

Section 6. All other terms and conditions of the Original Agreement are hereby ratified and confirmed.

Section 7. This Amendment shall be effective as of the date first written above upon execution by the Mayor and the Executive Director of the Commission.

 IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the City and the Commission have executed this First Amendment on the respective dates set forth below.
