 B. Any member of the retirement system who, upon termination of his employment with the City after at least five (5) years' membership in the retirement system, elects to leave all his contributions in the retirement fund pursuant to ~~Section~~Subsection 4.36.190 A shall be eligible to receive a retirement allowance upon reaching the age of sixty-two (62) years; provided, that if such member completed ten (10) years of service prior to termination of his employment, he shall be eligible to receive a retirement allowance upon reaching the age of fifty-seven (57) years, and if such member completed twenty (20) years of service prior to termination of his employment, he shall be eligible to receive a retirement allowance upon reaching the age of fifty-two (52) years.

 ***

 Section 5. Section 4.36.230 of the Seattle Municipal Code is amended as follows:

 SMC 4.36.230 Disability allowances designated.

 A. Upon retirement for disability, as provided in Section 4.36.220, provided the disability is not due to intemperance, willful misconduct or violation of law, of which the Board shall be the judge, a member shall receive a retirement allowance calculated as follows:

 One and one-half (11/2) percent of final compensation multiplied by years of creditable service, if such retirement allowance exceeds one-third (1/3) of his final compensation; otherwise one and one-half (11/2) percent of final compensation multiplied by years of service which would be creditable to him were his services to continue until attainment of age sixty-two (62) but such alternative disability retirement allowance shall not exceed one-third (1/3) of such final compensation; provided, that no disability retirement allowance shall exceed sixty (60) percent of final compensation. Notwithstanding any provision of this section to the contrary, the minimum retirement allowance shall be One Hundred Forty Dollars ($140) per month. The retirement allowance as above calculated shall consist of:

 1. An annuity which shall be the actuarial equivalent of the member's accumulated normal contributions;

 2. A pension which shall be the actuarial equivalent of the City's matching contributions;

 3. A pension for prior service, if any, calculated at the rate of one and one-half (11/2) percent of final compensation for each year of prior service, which shall be provided by contributions of the City;

 4. An additional pension, provided by contributions of the City, should the calculation of the allowance show that subsections A1, 2 and 3 above are not enough to produce the retirement allowance indicated;

 5. When use of proper annuity and pension rates results in a retirement allowance amounting to more than would be realized by adherence to the formula indicated in the second paragraph of this section the Board shall allow the higher amount.

 B. The disability allowances of all members retired for disability prior to January 1, 1971, shall on January 1, 1971, be increased by Twenty Dollars ($20) per month over the monthly benefit payable immediately prior to January 1, 1971, but no such pension of members retired for disability shall be less than One Hundred Forty Dollars ($140) per month as of such date. Nothing in this subsection shall affect the amount of any bonus dividend declared pursuant to Section 4.36.150. Such increases shall be paid from available retirement system funds or from contributions of the City; provided, that such increases shall not be applicable to persons retired for disability on and after September 1, 1970 and on and before December 31, 1970 who pursuant to Ordinance 99271 select benefits applicable to persons who retire on and after January 1, 1971.

 C. If disability is due to intemperance, willful misconduct, or violation of law, on the part of the member, the Board in its discretion, may pay to the member, in one lump sum his accumulated contributions in lieu of a retirement allowance; and such payment shall constitute full satisfaction of all obligations of the City to such member; and upon receipt of such payment he shall cease to be a member of the system.

 D. For distribution of benefits paid ~~U~~upon the death of a member~~,~~ while in receipt of a disability retirement allowance, see Subection 4.36.270(B).~~the member's accumulated contributions, as they were at the date of his or her retirement, less any annuity payments made to him or her, shall be paid to the member's estate, or to such persons as he or she shall have nominated by written designation duly executed and filed with the Board; provided, that:~~~~1. Such refund of contributions may be made in monthly payments if requested by the beneficiary and approved by the Board; and~~ ))

~~2. If the member's estate is not being probated, the Board, in its discretion, may as an alternative to making payment to his or her estate, authorize payment to an heir who would inherit if the estate were probated, such as a surviving spouse named under a community property agreement or in the member's will.~~

 E. Any surviving spouse or domestic partner of a member receiving a disability retirement allowance may, if named as beneficiary, elect to receive and thereupon shall be paid in lieu of benefits under ~~Section~~Subsection 4.36.230 D a monthly benefit the equivalent of a survivor's "Option E" retirement allowance computed on the basis of the member's age at date of death, years of creditable service, and normal and matching contributions reduced by all sums theretofore paid the deceased member as annuity on normal contributions and pension on matching contributions, and, if applicable, by payments to an alternate payee under a court or department order as contemplated by Section 4.36.295. The spouse or domestic partner may elect to receive a cash payment of not to exceed one-half (1/2) of the deceased member's remaining normal contributions, and such cash payment shall effect a reduction of the survivor's monthly benefit by the amount of annuity such payment would have purchased.

~~The Board may in its discretion authorize such payments to a surviving spouse, who is not named as a beneficiary, if (1) the surviving spouse is the principal beneficiary of the member's estate and named under a community property agreement or in the member's will; or (2) the member died without leaving a will and the retirement allowance was the property of the marital community and the surviving spouse.~~

 Section 6. Section 4.36.260 of the Seattle Municipal Code is amended as follows:

 SMC 4.36.260 Optional lesser retirement allowances and distribution of benefits upon death of a member who has been retired for service.

Election of Optional Lesser Retirement Allowances. A member may elect to receive, in lieu of the retirement allowance provided for in Section 4.36.210, its actuarial equivalent in the form of a lesser retirement allowance, payable in accordance with the terms and conditions of one (1) of the options set forth in Options A through E of this section. Options F and/or G may be elected alone or in conjunction with one (1) of the options set forth in Options A through E. The election of Option F or G will result in the actuarial equivalent of the retirement allowance otherwise payable. Option G includes the lump sum payment of a partial refund. If a combination is elected, the lesser retirement allowance shall be determined by first applying the Option G factor, if applicable, then the Option F factor, if applicable, and then finally the Option A -- E factor. ~~Upon the death of a retired member, any death benefits will be payable in accordance with the provisions of the options elected under this section if any.~~

 Election of any option must be made by written application filed with the Board of Administration at least thirty (30) days in advance of retirement as provided in Section 4.36.200, and shall not be effective unless approved by the Board prior to retirement of the member. The amount paid to a member, a beneficiary or a surviving spouse shall be reduced by payments made to an alternate payee under a court or department order as contemplated by Section 4.36.295.

Distribution of Benefits Upon Death of a Retired Member. Upon the death of a retired member, any death benefits will be payable in accordance with the provisions of the options elected under this section if any.  Options A through G.

 OPTION A. The lesser retirement allowance shall be payable to the member throughout his life; provided, that if he dies before he receives in annuity payments pursuant to ~~Section~~ Subsection 4.36.210 A1 a total amount equal to the amount of his accumulated contributions as of the date of his retirement, the balance of such accumulated contributions shall be paid in one (1) lump sum to his estate or to such person as he shall nominate by written designation duly executed and filed with the Board.

 OPTION B. The lesser retirement allowance shall be payable to a member throughout his life provided that if he dies before he receives in annuity payments pursuant to ~~Section~~ Subsection 4.36.210 A1 a total amount equal to the amount of his accumulated contributions as of the date of his retirement, the annuity payments resulting from his accumulated contributions shall be continued and paid to his estate or to such person as he shall nominate by written designation duly executed and filed with the Board, until the total amount of annuity payment shall equal the amount of his accumulated contributions as it was at the date of his retirement.

 OPTION C. The member shall elect a "guaranteed period" of any number of years. If he dies before the lesser retirement allowance has been paid to him for the number of years elected by him as the "guaranteed period," the lesser retirement allowance shall be continued to the end of the "guaranteed period," and during such continuation shall be paid to his estate or to such person as he shall nominate by written designation duly executed and filed with the Board.

 OPTION D. The lesser retirement allowance shall be payable to the member throughout life, and after the death of the member, one-half (1/2) of the lesser retirement allowance shall be continued throughout the life of and paid to the individual who was the spouse or domestic partner of the member at the time of retirement. If the spouse or domestic partner predeceases the member, then upon receipt of written notice of such death by the Board, the member's retirement allowance shall increase to the amount that would have been provided as if the member had not selected this option.

 OPTION E. The lesser retirement allowance shall be payable to the member throughout life, and after death of the member it shall be continued throughout the life of and paid to the individual who was the spouse or domestic partner of the member at the time of retirement. If the spouse or domestic partner predeceases the member, then upon receipt of written notice of such death by the Board, the member's retirement allowance shall increase to the amount that would have been provided as if the member had not selected this option.

 OPTION F. A member who retires from service prior to the age of becoming eligible for retirement payments under the federal system, commonly known as Social Security, and who at the time of retiring is fully insured under the federal system, may elect to have his retirement allowance payable during his or her life only, increased prior to the age at which the member could elect an unreduced Social Security retirement benefit and reduced after such age by amounts which have equivalent actuarial values. Prior to retirement, the member shall obtain, and provide to the Board, a written estimate of his Old-Age Benefit for the age at which the member could elect an unreduced Social Security benefit. If Option F is elected and the member's death occurs prior to the age at which the member could have elected an unreduced Social Security retirement benefit, any death benefit payable under any other option after the date the member would have attained such age, shall reflect the expected lesser amount of Option F.

 OPTION G. The member may elect to receive a lump sum payment upon retirement, of either fifty (50) percent or one hundred (100) percent of his or her accumulated contributions. The member's retirement allowance as provided for in Section 4.36.210 shall be reduced by the actuarial equivalent of the withdrawn lump sum.

 Section 7. Section 4.36.270 of the Seattle Municipal Code is amended as follows:

 SMC 4.36.270 ~~Death of member who is not retired~~ Distribution of benefits upon death of a member.

 A. Distribution of benefits upon the death of a member who has been retired for service. See Section 4.36.260.  B. Distribution of benefits upon the death of a member who has not been retired or who has been retired for disability.

The terms of this subsection apply upon the death of a member who has been retired for disability with the exception of the requirement that such member's surviving spouse waive in writing all rights to benefits under Subsection 4.36.270 C.

Upon the death of any member who has not been retired ~~pursuant to the provisions of this chapter,~~or who has been retired for disability, such member's accumulated contributions less any payments therefrom already made to such member shall be paid to such member's surviving spouse or domestic partner, or if the deceased member does not have a surviving spouse or domestic partner, or if the surviving spouse prior to the death of such member consented in writing to the naming as hereafter provided of a different beneficiary or beneficiaries and waived in writing all rights to benefits under ~~Section~~Subsection 4.36.270 ~~B~~C, then to such member's estate, or to such person or persons as such member shall have nominated by written designation duly executed and filed with the Board. Such payment may be made in one lump sum or may be paid in installments over a period of not to exceed five (5) years, as may be designated by the member or his beneficiary, with such rate of interest as may be determined by the Board.

~~B~~. C. Distribution of benefits upon the death of a member who has not been retired.

1.

The spouse or domestic partner may, however, elect to receive in lieu of either the above retirement allowance or the benefits under ~~Section~~Subsection 4.36.270 ~~A~~B, a lesser retirement allowance to cease at such spouse's or domestic partner's death and in addition a cash payment not to exceed one-half (1/2) of the deceased member's accumulated normal contributions. However, such withdrawal shall not serve to reduce such lesser retirement allowance except by the amount of annuity which such withdrawal would have purchased.

~~C.~~2. If there be no surviving spouse or domestic partner at the time of death of a member not retired, but having at least ten (10) years of creditable service as defined in this chapter, and such member has surviving one (1) or more children under the age of eighteen (18) years, and if such child or children are named as beneficiary or if the contributions of the deceased member are payable to such member's estate under the provisions of ~~Section~~Subsection 36.270 ~~A~~B, then the legal guardian of such child or children may elect for such child or children a monthly benefit as hereinafter provided, which monthly benefit shall be paid in lieu of the benefits payable under ~~Section~~Subsection 4.36.270 ~~A~~B. Such monthly benefits shall be equal to the monthly benefit which would have been paid to the last spouse of such deceased member if such last spouse had been living and married to the deceased member at the time of his death and was otherwise eligible for and elected to receive the benefits provided in ~~Section~~Subsection 4.36.270 ~~B~~C equivalent to a survivor's "Option B" retirement allowance without a cash payment of a portion of the deceased member's accumulated normal contributions. The guardian may, however, elect to receive in lieu of either the above benefits or the benefits under ~~Section~~Subsection 4.36.270 ~~A~~B, a lesser retirement allowance which will continue until such child or children reach the age of eighteen (18) years and in addition a cash payment not to exceed one-half (1/2) of the deceased member's accumulated normal contributions. However, such withdrawal shall not serve to reduce such lesser allowance except by the amount of annuity which such withdrawal would have purchased. All benefits payable under this subsection shall be paid to the legal guardian of such child or children under the age of eighteen (18) years until all of such children have reached the age of eighteen (18) years, and shall be for the benefit of such minor children.

~~D~~3. The amount paid to a member's estate, beneficiary or surviving spouse or domestic partner may be reduced by payments made to an alternate payee under a court or department order as contemplated by Section 4.36.295.

~~E~~4. If the member's estate is not being probated, the Board, in its discretion, may as an alternative to making payment to his or her estate, authorize payment to an heir who would inherit if the estate were probated, such as a surviving spouse named under a community property agreement or in the member's will.

 Section. 8. Section 4.36.320 of the Seattle Municipal Code is amended as follows:

 SMC 4.36.320 Death benefits -- Payment.

 A. Upon proof of the death ~~on or subsequent to January 1, 1960,~~ of a member of the retirement system who has paid all death benefit assessments as hereinafter provided ~~and who has not been retired~~, the sum of Two Thousand Dollars ($2,000) as a death benefit shall be paid to such member's surviving spouse or domestic partner or if such deceased member does not have a surviving spouse or domestic partner, or if the surviving spouse prior to the death of such member consented in writing to the naming as hereinafter provided of a different beneficiary or beneficiaries, then to such member's estate or to such person or persons as such member shall have nominated by written designation duly executed and filed with the Board. If the member's estate is not being probated, the Board, in its discretion, may as an alternative to making payment to his or her estate, authorize payment to an heir who would inherit if the estate were probated, such as a surviving spouse named under a community property agreement or in the member's will.

 B. Any member of the retirement system may elect to continue in the death benefit system and pay the death benefit assessments: provided, that such payment shall not be required of a member retiring for disability until age sixty (60), whereupon such member shall be required to pay all death benefit assessments thereafter accruing if he or she desires to continue in the death benefit system. Upon proof of the death of such member, the payment shall be Two Thousand Dollars ($2,000).

 Section 9. Section 4.36.330 of the Seattle Municipal Code is amended as follows:

 SMC 4.36.330 Death benefits -- Specifications.

 A. All moneys paid into or out of the retirement fund on account of the death benefit system shall be accounted for by double entry separately in the records of the retirement system in such a manner as to reveal currently the amount of money held for payment of death benefits.

 B. Death benefit assessments shall become due and payable January 1st of each year and collectible by payroll deduction or otherwise as directed by the Board. In order to insure coverage of members laid off or on leave of absence or on family or medical leave under Chapter 4.26, the Board is authorized to transfer amounts necessary to pay assessments due from such members from their normal contributions as temporary loans to be repaid by such members on return to City service. Death benefit assessments shall be in such amount as shall be determined by the Board but shall not exceed the sum of Twelve Dollars ($12) in any calendar year.

 C. An employee becoming a member of the system during the year shall pay the death benefit assessment fixed for that year if such membership is effective prior to October 1st, which assessment shall be collectible by payroll deduction when the first normal contribution is made. Employees becoming members in October, November and December shall pay only one-half (1/2) of that annual assessment.

 D. The City shall match all death benefit assessments collected from members and such matching payments shall become due and payable immediately following determination of the amount necessary, and should the death benefit system require payments by the City of more than the amount necessary to match an assessment of not to exceed Twelve Dollars ($12), as determined by the Board on advice of its actuary, the same may be made from undivided earnings of the City and the employee in the retirement fund not otherwise obligated. All payments by the City shall be due and payable annually on January 1st. Assessments collected from retired members shall be matched by funds from departments from which such members retired.

 E. ~~Upon establishment of the death benefit system as of January 1, 1950, the Board shall recognize as beneficiaries thereunder all persons previously nominated to receive refund of accumulated contributions under Section 4.36.270 A unless a different designation is filed with regard to payment of death benefits.~~F.

 Membership in the death benefit system shall terminate when any member resigns, quits or is discharged and no refund of any portion of death benefit assessments shall be made by reason thereof. Should the Board determine that a member of the retirement system not in City service was maintaining membership for the sole purpose of possibly receiving retirement benefits in the future, the Board shall deny participation in the death benefit system to such member.

~~G~~F. The Board of Administration shall make all rules and regulations necessary to supplement the death benefit provisions of this chapter.
