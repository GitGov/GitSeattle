 AN ORDINANCE relating to rates and terms of taxes on the collection or transfer of solid waste; and amending Seattle Municipal Code Chapter 5.48 in connection therewith.

 WHEREAS, the City does not set rates for, or send a bill to, many of those who benefit from City activities such as litter pick-up programs or landfill closures; and

 WHEREAS, the City established solid waste taxes to recover certain solid waste system costs that cannot be equitably recovered through collection rates, City transfer station rates, and the commercial disposal rate; and

 WHEREAS, the City last modified solid waste tax rates effective December 31, 1999; and

 WHEREAS, in the second and third quarters of 2002 the City conducted a solid waste rate review; and

 WHEREAS, recommendations to modify the solid waste tax rates were developed from this rate review; and

 WHEREAS, the City desires to implement these recommendations; and

 WHEREAS, the City desires to clarify that to be exempt from solid waste taxes, solid waste collected or transported for recycling shall contain no more than 10% non-recyclable material, by volume; NOW, THEREFORE,

 BE IT ORDAINED BY THE CITY OF SEATTLE AS FOLLOWS:

 Section 1. Seattle Municipal Code Section 5.48.055 is amended as follows:

 SMC 5.48.055 Solid waste activities subject to tax --Amount.

 There is levied upon, and shall be collected from everyone including The City of Seattle, on account of the following business activities engaged in or carried on with respect to solid waste, an annual license fee or occupation tax in the amount to be determined by the application of the rates given below:

 A. Upon everyone engaged in or carrying on the business of operating a garbage transfer station or upon the business of transferring solid waste generated in or outside of Seattle from one (1) mode of transportation to another a fee or tax equal to Six Dollars and Twenty-five Cents ($6.25) per ton of the waste handled for transportation or transported for garbage disposal, landfill, or incineration purposes. Effective January 1, 2003, upon everyone engaged in or carrying on the business of operating a garbage transfer station or upon the business of transferring solid waste generated in or outside of Seattle from one (1) mode of transportation to another a fee or tax equal to Six Dollars and Forty Five Cents ($6.45) per ton of the waste handled for transportation or transported for garbage disposal, landfill, or incineration purposes.To prevent pyramiding of the tax under this subsection when two (2) or more transfers occur in Seattle, the fee or tax is imposed only upon the last transferor and shall not apply to earlier transfers. Waste is transferred from one (1) mode of transportation to another whenever it is moved from a motor vehicle (including, for example, landgrading or earthmoving equipment), barge, train or other carrier to another motor vehicle (including landgrading or earthmoving equipment), barge, train or other carrier, irrespective of whether or not temporary storage occurs in the process, provided that waste shall not be considered transferred if it has been placed in a sealed shipping container prior to being moved from one mode of transportation to another in the City. Solid waste transported for recycling or reuse as recovered material (which solid waste shall contain no more than ten percent non- recyclable material, by volume), yardwaste destined for composting, items to be scrapped for salvage, and sand and gravel for construction of a public improvement shall not be included in the tonnage by which the fee or tax is measured.

 B. Upon everyone, including The City of Seattle, engaged in or carrying on the business of the collection of garbage, rubbish, trash, CDL Waste, and other solid waste, a fee or tax measured by the total of ~~these two~~ components 1 and 2 below:

 1. Ten (10) percent of the total gross income from the collection of solid waste in Seattle, less income derived from the activities identified in subsection C of this section; and

 2. a.  Twelve Dollars and Five Cents ($12.05) per ton of ~~the materials~~solid waste collected in Seattle, excluding the tonnage ~~identified in subsection~~from recycling when such recycling contains no more than ten percent non-recyclable material by volume, yardwaste destined for composting, items to be reused or scrapped for salvage, and/or sand and gravel for construction of a public improvement; or

b. Effective January 1, 2003, Twelve Dollars and Forty Cents ($12.40) per ton of solid waste collected in Seattle, excluding the tonnage from recycling when such recycling contains no more than ten percent non-recyclable material by volume, yardwaste destined for composting, items to be reused or scrapped for salvage, and/or sand and gravel for construction of a public improvement.

 C. The gross receipts factor identified in subsection B1 of this section above shall exclude income derived from:

 1. Collection and/or sale of recycled materials and/or recovered materials, including charges for the lease or rental of containers used in the collection of recycled/recovered materials;

 2. Collection and/or sale after processing of yardwaste products, including charges for the lease or rental of containers used in the collection of yardwaste products;

 3. Sale of containers used for collection of residential solid waste;

 4. Collection and disposal of bulky items and white goods;

 5. Grants and contracts from governmental agencies;

 6. The City of Seattle for collecting or disposing of residential garbage and other solid waste;

 7. The portion of the City's solid waste collection receipts expended for collection of recyclable materials and yardwaste; and

 8. Transportation or deposit of sand and gravel for construction or a public improvement.

~~D. The tonnage factor identified in subsection B2 of this section above shall exclude income derived from recycled materials and/or recovered materials, yardwaste destined for composting; items to be recycled, reused, or scrapped for salvage, and/or sand and gravel for construction of a public improvement.~~

~~E.~~D. The tax imposed under subsection A of this section applies to transferring in the City of all solid waste generated in or outside the City and the tax imposed under subsection B of this section applies only to collecting solid waste in the City. The taxes imposed under subsections A and B of this section are cumulative as to solid waste collected and transferred in the City, even though the same tonnage of solid waste may be involved at each successive stage in the disposal process, and the economic burden of the two (2) taxes may aggregate.

~~F.~~E. Income derived from activities described in subsection C of this section above shall be taxed under SMC Chapter 5.45.

 Section 2. The provisions of this ordinance are declared to be separate and severable. If any one or more of the provisions of this ordinance shall be declared by any court of competent jurisdiction to be contrary to law, then such provision or provisions shall be null and void and severed from the rest of this ordinance, and all other provisions of this ordinance shall remain valid and enforceable.

 Section 3. This ordinance shall take effect and be in force thirty (30) days from and after its approval by the Mayor, but if not approved and returned by the Mayor within ten (10) days after presentation, it shall take effect as provided by Municipal Code Section 1.04.020.
