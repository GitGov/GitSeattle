 THIS PROPERTY USE AND DEVELOPMENT AGREEMENT (the "Agreement") is executed this _____ day of ______, 2004 in favor of the City of Seattle, a Washington municipal corporation (herein called "City"), by Regional Holdings, LLC, a Washington corporation, sole owner of property legally described below (herein called "Owner").

 RECITALS

 A. The Owner is the sole owner of that certain real property in the City of Seattle described as Lot one in Block 56 of Terry's First Addition to the Town of Seattle (703 Columbia Street) and currently zoned Highrise (HR), which is the subject of this Agreement (herein called the "Property").

 B. The Owner submitted to the City of Seattle an application for a contract rezone from HR to Neighborhood Commercial 3 - 160' (NC3- 160).

 C. Seattle Municipal Code (SMC) Section 23.34.004 allows the City to approve a contract rezone subject to "self-imposed restrictions upon the use and development of the property in order to ameliorate adverse impacts which could occur from unrestricted use and development permitted in the zone."

 D. Owner has a fee simple or other beneficial interest in the Property described in paragraph A and wants the City Council to rezone the property pursuant to SMC 23.34.004.

 E. The City, in approving this Agreement, has determined, pursuant to SMC 23.34.004, that the rezone of the Property, subject to the terms of this Agreement, would not be materially detrimental to the public welfare or injurious to the property in the zone or vicinity in which the Property is located.

 AGREEMENT

 Section 1. Zone Change Limited to Proposed Use. Pursuant to SMC 23.34.004, Owner hereby covenants, bargains and agrees, on behalf of itself and its successors and assigns, that it will comply with the following limitations and conditions in consideration of the rezone of the Property from HR to NC3-160:

 a) Expansion of the existing structure is limited to the expansion that is proposed in the plans submitted to the Department of Planning and Development (DPD) under MUP 2202713 and non-residential development on site is restricted to the expansion of the existing building as proposed in MUP 2202713;

 b) Further development on the site, under Neighborhood Commercial 3 standards, is restricted to prohibit any non-residential uses on the site above the second level of the structure, as counted above the alley along the east property line; and

 c) Residential development on site, above the second level of the structure as counted above the level of the existing alley along the east property line, is subject to the Highrise development standards of Chapter 23.45, and not the development standards for mixed-use development in the commercial section of the Land Use Code.

 Section 2. Agreement Runs With the Land. This Agreement shall be recorded in the records of King County by the City Clerk. The covenants hereof are deemed to attach to and run with the Property and are binding upon the Owner, its heirs, successors and assigns, and apply to after-acquired title of the Owner of the Property; provided, however, the covenants herein and the rezone shall expire and be of no force and effect unless, prior to, or within two years from the effective date of the ordinance approving the contract rezone, a complete application is filed for a master use permit that is subsequently issued for the improvements contemplated in this Agreement. If a Master Use Permit for the improvements contemplated in this Agreement is issued, the contract rezone shall continue in effect unless the Master Use Permit expires pursuant to the provisions of Section 23.76.032 of the Seattle Municipal Code, prior to substantial completion of the improvements contemplated in this Agreement. If this later condition occurs, the covenants herein and the rezone shall expire and be of no force and effect.

 Section 3. Amendment, Exercise of Police Power, No Precedent. This Agreement may be amended or modified only by a written agreement signed by the Owner and the City, and approved by the legislative authority of the City by ordinance. Nothing in this Agreement shall prevent the City Council from making such further amendments to the Land Use Code or exercising the City's police power, as it may deem necessary in the public interest. Owner agrees that nothing in this Agreement is intended to authorize any use or dimension not otherwise permitted in an NC3-160 zone, except as approved in this Agreement. The conditions contained in this Agreement are based on the unique circumstances applicable to the Property, and this Agreement is not intended to establish precedent for other rezones in the surrounding area.

 Section 4. Benefit. This Agreement is made for the benefit of the City and for the benefit of the owners of the property within 300 feet of the Property and either the City or any such benefited property owner may institute and prosecute any proceeding at law or in equity to enforce this Agreement.

 Section 5. Repeal as Additional Remedy. Owner acknowledges that compliance with the conditions of this Agreement is a condition of the subject rezone and that if Owner avails itself of the benefits of this rezone but then fails to comply with the conditions of this Agreement with the City, in addition to pursuing any other remedy, the City may revoke the rezone by ordinance and require the use of the Property to conform to the requirements of the previously existing HR zone.
