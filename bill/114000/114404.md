 ATTACHMENT A

 October 23, 2002

 Ken Bounds Superintendent Seattle Department of Parks and Recreation 100 Dexter Avenue North Seattle, WA 98109

 Dear Mr. Bounds:

 I am writing to let you know that the Seattle Parks Foundation is to be the recipient of a grant of $1,300,000 from an anonymous donor to enable establishment of a new urban park. We believe that this may be the largest single donation for a park in the history of Seattle.

 This extraordinary donation is to be used to purchase and develop a half-acre of property located on the southeast corner of 24th Avenue and East Howell St. The park will be designed with community input and transformed into a unique and beautiful neighborhood park.

 The costs and funding breakdown for this project are as follows:

 $1,120,000 Property acquisition 50,000 Closing costs, demolition and site clean-up 400,000 Design and development of the park 40,000 Park Maintenance Fund* 40,000 Park Foundation's associated project costs $1,650,000

 Sources of funds:

 $1,300,000 Anonymous donor/Seattle Parks Foundation 350,000 Seattle Park Levy/King County Conservation Futures Fund $1,650,000

 *The Seattle Parks Foundation will retain this funding and work with the Department of Parks and Recreation to establish the best approach for on-going enhancement of the city's maintenance and operations of this park.

 When the Seattle Parks Foundation receives the above-recited sums from the donor, we will pay them to the City of Seattle Department of Parks and Recreation, on condition that they be applied exclusively to the purposes recited in this letter to you, and that the park be named Homer Harris Park.

 Homer Harris is considered one of the most accomplished athletes in Seattle's history. He was a football and track star from Garfield High School in the 1930s. He was born and raised in the Central Area and overcame racial prejudice and broke color barriers. He was the first black football captain in the history of the Big 10. He received a medical degree from Meharry Medical College and practiced dermatology for 43 years in Seattle. He now lives on Queen Anne with his wife, and he has just been inducted into the Iowa Athletic Hall of Fame.

 It is an honor for the Seattle Parks Foundation to be the recipient of such a generous gift in recognition of this inspiring individual.

 Yours truly,

 Karen Daubert Executive Director
