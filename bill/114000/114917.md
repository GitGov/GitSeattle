 THIS IS A LEASE made and entered into between the WASHINGTON STATE DEPARTMENT OF TRANSPORTATION, ("WSDOT"), and the CITY OF SEATTLE, ("CITY") a municipal corporation, acting through its Department of Parks and Recreation;

 WHEREAS, WSDOT constructed the "sit-in park" now commonly known as Boren-Pike-Pine Park during construction of Interstate 5, in return for the City's ongoing maintenance of same; and

 WHEREAS, the CITY desires to use the premises to be leased to construct, operate and maintain a public recreational area as part of their local park plan as an interim use until the land and premises to be leased are needed for a highway purpose; and

 WHEREAS, the CITY has received additional parks funding and wishes to replace the deteriorated original State constructed improvements upon the Leased Premises, for which additional consideration is required; and

 WHEREAS, the CITY shall maintain, pursuant to a separate Maintenance Agreement GM_______ (number to be assigned by WSDOT upon execution) entered into concurrent with this Lease, WSDOT-owned real property located adjacent to the land and premises to be leased herein; and;

 WHEREAS, WSDOT is granted authority to lease property under RCW 47.12.120; and

 WHEREAS, the CITY has authority to lease property pursuant to Article 1, Section 1 of "The Charter of The City of Seattle" as adopted at the General Election of March 12, 1946 and as amended.

 NOW THEREFORE in consideration of the terms, conditions, covenants and performances contained herein, IT IS MUTUALLY AGREED THAT:

 1. LEASED PREMISES. WSDOT does hereby lease to the CITY, and the CITY does hereby lease from WSDOT, the premises ("Leased Premises" or "Premises") located in the NW1/4 of the NW1/4 and the SW1/4 of the NW1/4 in Section 32, Township 25 North, Range 4 East, W.M., in King County, Washington, and known to be a portion of the highway right of way of SR 5, Seattle Freeway: Jackson Street to Olive Way, Sheet 6 of 6 sheets, and as further shown hachured on Exhibit "A" attached hereto and by this reference incorporated herein.

 The Leased Premises consist of Ã± 25,419 square feet of land.

 2. TERM. The term of this lease ("Lease") shall be Ten (10) years, COMMENCING ON THE DATE OF EXECUTION OF THIS LEASE BY WSDOT ("Commencement Date").

 3. RENEWAL. This Lease may be renewed by CITY for (1) additional Ten (10) year period ("Renewal Period"); Provided that; (A.) CITY is not in default and has not been in default during the term of this Lease; (B.) there is no other public need for the Leased Premises; (C.) CITY's continued use under this Lease does not impair the safety or operation of WSDOT 's highway or facility, as solely determined by WSDOT; and (D.) the terms and conditions of this Lease conform to then existing state policies or practices, laws, regulations and contracts, or provided CITY is willing to amend this Lease to bring it into compliance with such policies, practices, laws, regulations, and contracts. The Renewal Period shall be on the same terms and conditions as set forth herein, except as modified by any changes in policies, practices, laws, regulations or contracts and as reflected in a written amendment signed by both parties. CITY shall give notice of its intent to renew this Lease for the Renewal Period at least ninety (90) days, but not more than six (6) months, prior to the expiration of this Lease, or any extension thereof.

 4. HOLDING OVER. (Do not use on a month-to-month lease.) In the event CITY shall hold over or remain in possession of the Leased Premises with the consent of WSDOT after the expiration of the stated term of this Lease, or any written extension or renewal of the term of this Lease, such holding over or continued possession shall create a tenancy from month-to-month only, upon the same terms and conditions as are set forth herein; Provided, that WSDOT or CITY may, in addition to other remedies provided elsewhere herein, terminate this Lease for any reason with not less than twenty (20) days prior written notice.

 5. CONSIDERATION.

 A. CITY's maintenance of the WSDOT-owned real property located adjacent to the Leased Premises under Maintenance Agreement GM______(number to be assigned by WSDOT upon execution) in exchange for CITY's use of the Leased Premises is deemed a highway benefit equivalent in value to the economic rent for the Leased Premises.

 B. In the event the Maintenance Agreement is terminated, expires, or is modified, WSDOT shall have the right to review such change, and may require that this Lease be amended and CITY begin paying rent retroactive to the termination, expiration or modification to the Maintenance Agreement. Fair market rent will be determined by an appraiser agreed upon by WSDOT and CITY.

 C. In the event the Lease is modified to require rent payment, WSDOT's acceptance of late payment charges and/or any portion of the overdue payment shall in no event constitute an accord and satisfaction, compromise of such payment, or a waiver of CITY's default with respect to such overdue payment, nor prevent WSDOT from exercising any other rights and remedies granted in this Lease.

 6. TERMINATION BY WSDOT.

 A. WSDOT may terminate this Lease, without penalty or further liability as follows:

 (1) Upon not less than thirty (30) days prior written notice to CITY, if CITY defaults, and fails to cure such default within that thirty (30) day period, or such longer period, as may be reasonably determined by WSDOT, if CITY is diligently working to cure the default;

 38. MODIFICATIONS. This Lease, and the Maintenance Agreement contain all the agreements and conditions made between the parties hereto pertaining to the use of the Leased Premises herein described and may not be modified orally or in any other manner other than by a written agreement signed by all parties hereto.

 39. INTERPRETATION. This Lease shall be governed by and interpreted in accordance with the laws of the State of Washington. The titles to paragraphs, sections, or other parts of this Lease are for convenience only and shall have no effect on the construction or interpretation of any part hereof.
