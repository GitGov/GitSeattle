 Agreement regarding the Design, Construction, Operation and Maintenance of the Downtown Seattle Transit Tunnel and Related Facilities between and among King County, The City of Seattle And The Central Puget Sound Regional Transit Authority

 June ____, 2002

 THIS AGREEMENT ("Agreement") is entered between and among King County ("County"), The City of Seattle ("City") and the Central Puget Sound Regional Transit Authority ("Sound Transit"). Collectively, the agencies are referred to as the "Parties."

 RECITALS

 A. The County is a home rule charter county with broad powers to provide public transportation within the County's geographic boundaries. The County owns and operates an extensive system of buses, vanpools, accessible services vehicles, park and ride lots, transit centers, transit hubs, and other transportation facilities within the County.

 B. Sound Transit is a duly organized regional transit authority existing under Chapters 81.104 and 81.112 RCW and has all powers necessary to implement a high capacity transportation ("HCT") system. On November 5, 1996, central Puget Sound area voters approved local funding for Sound Move, Sound Transit's ten-year regional transit plan. The plan includes light rail, commuter rail, and regional express bus/high occupancy vehicle (HOV) systems that will be integrated with local transit systems and use a single or integrated, regional fare structure.

 C. The City is a city of the first class in the State of Washington with its own charter, and as such, has authority co-extensive with the State unless the exercise of a City power would violate the Constitution or a general law of the State, and all of the powers conferred upon incorporated cities and towns by Title 35 RCW and other laws of the state, and all powers that are usually exercised by municipal corporations of like character and degree. The City is responsible for, and has authority over, the laying out and supervision of all transportation public works within the City and on property belonging to or controlled by the City (including but not limited to street rights-of-way); and the management, construction, repair, maintenance, and control of all streets, gutters, and sidewalks; and the enforcement and implementation of City ordinances, contracts, and rules that relate to matters within the jurisdiction of the City administrative unit responsible therefor, namely Seattle Transportation. The City has specific statutory authority to prescribe the terms and conditions under which any street, avenue, alley, sidewalk, or other public ground may be used and to regulate all such use.

 D. This Agreement is entered into consistent with the principles articulated in the Memorandum of Understanding Establishing a Cooperative Relationship entered into between Sound Transit and the County on May 11, 1998, and the April 20, 1998 Memorandum of Agreement for Intergovernmental Cooperation between Sound Transit and the City regarding Light Rail Development authorized by City Ordinance 118927, and the subsequent supplements to that Memorandum of Agreement.

 E. The Agreement between the City and Sound Transit for Grant of Non-Exclusive Use of a Light Rail Transit Way as Related to the Central Link Light Rail Project, dated July 2000, and authorized by City Ordinance 119975 ("Light Rail Transit Way Agreement") authorizes Sound Transit's construction and operation of Link light rail within City of Seattle rights-of-way.

 F. The Municipality of Metropolitan Seattle ("Metro"), now merged with the County, constructed the Downtown Seattle Transit Tunnel ("Tunnel") to provide an additional right-of-way in downtown Seattle for buses and, at a future date, possibly trains. The Tunnel was constructed using a combination of federal and Metro funds and bond proceeds. The County continues to pay debt service on the bonds. Since 1990, the Tunnel has provided fast, reliable and comfortable service exclusively for bus riders from throughout the County. The County currently operates its own buses and Sound Transit Express Route 550 buses in the Tunnel.

 G. Most of the Tunnel is located within the City's right-of-way, under downtown Seattle streets. The City holds its streets and other public rights-of-way, including but not limited to the right-of-way for the Tunnel, in trust for the convenience of public travel, and has legal authority to regulate and control the use of such streets and public rights-of-way for that purpose. Through the Master Cooperation Agreement between the City and Metro that was authorized by City Ordinance 112462 (the "Master Cooperation Agreement"), the City granted Metro the right to use the City right-of-way for the Tunnel for so long as it is used for public transportation purposes, subject to the terms and conditions of that Master Cooperation Agreement, future agreements between the City and Metro, and the City's authority over its streets and other public rights-of-way.

 H. On June 1, 2000, the County, the City and Sound Transit entered into that certain Downtown Seattle Transit Tunnel Transfer Agreement ("Transfer Agreement") that established the terms and conditions for a conveyance of the Tunnel to Sound Transit for Sound Transit's use of the Tunnel solely for light rail operations. Because of changed circumstances, the Parties intend that this Agreement supersede the Transfer Agreement.

 I. On November 29, 2001 the Sound Transit Board of Directors adopted Resolution 2001-16 selecting the alignment and profiles, station locations, and vehicle maintenance base site to be built for the Minimum Operable Segment of the Central Link Light Rail Project. Said Minimum Operable Segment (hereinafter, "Initial Segment") would utilize the Tunnel and extend from a train turn-around track located in a Tunnel Annex to be built east of the Tunnel's Westlake Station to a southern terminus at South 154th Street in the City of Tukwila.

 J. Sound Transit is proceeding to obtain a full funding grant agreement from the Federal Transit Administration ("FTA") for the construction of the Initial Segment. Sound Transit is also proceeding with planning for extensions of the Initial Segment to the north and the south.

 K. The regional transportation system will be improved if both buses and light rail trains operate through downtown Seattle in the Tunnel. Continued operation of buses in the Tunnel will enable regional bus routes to use the Tunnel and benefit transit patrons not directly served by light rail.

 L. The County and Sound Transit recognize, however, that operation of both buses and light rail trains within the Tunnel will require a safe and efficient coordination of vehicle movements that is best accomplished by a single agency operating County buses, Sound Transit Express buses and Sound Transit trains.

 M. Retrofitting the Tunnel to permit the addition of train operations in the Tunnel will require the rerouting of buses onto surface streets during the Closure Period. The Parties will make significant downtown transit-oriented improvements to the surface streets to promote effective downtown streets for all users. These improvements will take into consideration the needs of local businesses as well as transit riders, auto users, bicyclists, commercial traffic, pedestrians, and emergency response vehicles. The surface improvements are intended to implement the conditions of the FTA Record of Decision on the Central Link Light Rail Project issued on May 8, 2002 (the "ROD").

 N. The County and Sound Transit agree that the County likely has the resources and skills needed to operate and maintain the Central Link light rail system when it begins operating revenue service.

 O. This Agreement is intended to establish that Sound Transit shall have the right to own or use the Tunnel for High Capacity Transportation ("HCT") purposes subject to the terms of this Agreement and the subsequent agreements contemplated herein.

 P. The environmental impacts relating to this Agreement have been disclosed and evaluated as part of an Environmental Assessment of the Central Link Light Rail Transit Project (February, 2002).

 Q. The Parties are authorized to enter into this Agreement pursuant to RCW 81.112.070, Chapters 39.33 and 39.34 RCW and other applicable laws.

 6.0 CONVENTION PLACE STATION

 6.1 General

 The County is planning a two-phase transit-oriented development ("TOD") at the Convention Place Station ("CPS") site. Phase One may involve construction of a below-grade bus transit station and a parking structure. Phase Two is anticipated to involve private commercial development and may include upward expansion of the parking structure. Both the County and Sound Transit would benefit from increased density and economic activity in the vicinity of their public transportation services. Additionally, Sound Transit may need access to a portion of the Convention Place Station for construction staging during the Closure Period Construction Work.

 6.2 Street and Alley Vacation

 In 1988, in response to the County's petition, the City granted conceptual approval to the vacation of the alley within Block 32, Heirs of Sarah A. Bell's Second Addition to the City of Seattle according to the plat recorded in Vol. 1 of Plats, page 121, Records of King County, Washington, and that portion of Terry Avenue lying adjacent to Lots 7, 8 and 9 of that same block and Lots 4, 5 and 6 of Block 44 in the same addition. Final vacation of the subject alley and portion of Terry Avenue was conditioned upon the County's providing pedestrian access between Olive Way and Pine Streets as noted in City Clerk's File No. 295303. To date, the County has not satisfied those conditions so the vacation of the alley and the specified portion of Terry Avenue has not been completed.

 In order to accomplish the TOD, vacation of Terry Avenue and the alley within the Convention Place Station property is necessary. The City supports the development of the Convention Place Station in an intensive and transit-oriented manner and the provision of a public pedestrian access through the Convention Place Station property between Olive Way and Pine Street. Accordingly, the City's legislative authority is willing, upon request of the County or its proposed developer and the presentation to the City's legislative authority of a master plan for the redevelopment of Convention Place Station area, to consider modifying the conditions imposed with respect to the County's 1988 petition to vacate such alley and portion of Terry Avenue.

 The County shall use its best efforts to ensure that the conditions imposed with respect to the County's 1988 petition or such modified conditions as the City's legislative authority and the County may agree upon are implemented in connection with any redevelopment of the Convention Place Station area. Included in such County efforts shall be the making of one or more presentations to the City's legislative authority to keep such officials fully informed regarding the status of redevelopment efforts with respect to such area. The City agrees to expedite its review of any modification of the conditions associated with such alley and street vacation proposed by the County or its site developer. It is the intent of the County to ensure that in any conveyance of the Convention Place Station site or a substantial portion thereof for redevelopment, the grantee is obligated to provide free, public pedestrian access between Olive Way and Pine Street through such site and to otherwise comply with the design review, development, and other conditions imposed both with respect to the vacation of such alley and portion of Terry Avenue and new construction at the time such development occurs. The County recognizes that additional conditions may be imposed by the City's legislative authority in response to a request to modify the conditions described in City Clerk's File No. 295303, including, but not limited to, requiring that the City be named as a third party beneficiary of such obligation, and that the City be granted the right to specifically enforce such obligation.

 If they are unable to resolve the dispute, the matter shall be submitted to a mediation board comprised of three persons, none of whom shall be employed by the County or Sound Transit, and none of whom shall be a member or former member of either the County Council or the Sound Transit Board of Directors. The members of the mediation board shall be individuals with requisite skills and experience appropriate to resolution of the construction dispute. The County and Sound Transit may recommend one or more persons to be appointed to the mediation board but all three members shall be approved by both the County and Sound Transit. The County and Sound Transit shall submit the issues to the mediation board, which shall make recommendations for resolution of the issues within thirty (30) Calendar Days after the submission date. The mediation board's recommendations shall be advisory and not binding on the County and Sound Transit but shall be given due consideration by said parties in attempting to resolve the issues presented.

 9.3.3 Process for Developing Agreement

 If the County and Sound Transit have not executed said Closure Period Construction Agreement by January 31, 2003, the County and Sound Transit shall establish a mediation board comprised of three persons, none of whom shall be employed by the County or Sound Transit, and none of whom shall be a member or former member of either the County Council or the Sound Transit Board of Directors. The members of the mediation board shall be individuals with requisite skills and experience appropriate to resolution of the remaining issues in the development of the Closure Period Construction Agreement. The County and Sound Transit may recommend one or more persons to be appointed to the mediation board but all three members shall be approved by both the County and Sound Transit. The County and Sound Transit shall submit the remaining issues to the mediation board, which shall make recommendations for resolution of the issues within thirty (30) Calendar Days after the submission date. The mediation board's recommendations shall be advisory and not binding on the County and Sound Transit but shall be given due consideration by said parties in attempting to resolve the issues presented. The negotiated Closure Period Construction Agreement shall be executed by the King County Director of Transportation and the Sound Transit Executive Director. If the Closure Period Construction Agreement is not executed by March 31, 2003 (or by the date of an extension agreed to by the County's Director of Transportation and Sound Transit's Executive Director), concurrent with the O&M Agreement referred to in Section 16.0, then the provisions of Section 19 for Sound Transit to purchase the Tunnel shall apply.

 9.4 Amendments to the Closure Period Construction Agreement

 Upon Sound Transit's completion of final design for the Closure Period Construction Work, representatives of the County and Sound Transit shall review the scope and other terms of the Closure Period Construction Agreement and make such revisions as are necessary. Such amendments, and any other amendments that may be necessary prior to or during implementation of the Closure Period Construction Agreement, may be executed by the County's Director of Transportation and Sound Transit's Executive Director.

 10.0 DOWNTOWN SEATTLE TRAFFIC AND STREET IMPROVEMENTS

 10.1 Conditions Precedent

 Prior to the commencement of construction of the improvements contemplated in this Section 10, Sound Transit shall have demonstrated to the satisfaction of the County and the City that Sound Transit has executed, with the necessary authorization of its Board, a full funding grant agreement with the FTA for the construction of the Initial Segment.

 10.2 Required Improvements

 In order to mitigate the impacts of re-routing buses from the Tunnel onto surface streets during Closure Period Construction Work and in order to promote bus operation and reliability on surface streets after the Tunnel is re-opened, the Parties agree that certain surface traffic and street improvements are needed. The Parties agree to construct, install, and implement the improvements, projects and actions identified in the "Summary of Downtown Seattle Traffic and Street Improvements" that is attached hereto and made a part hereof as Exhibit 3. The scope of these improvements shall not alter or amend or be inconsistent with the mitigation measures required under the ROD with regard to the impacts of rerouting buses during the Closure Period. The City agrees, for purposes of any permit the City issues for the Closure Period Construction Work, that the Downtown Seattle Traffic and Street Improvements shall be adequate to mitigate the traffic impacts of said Closure Period Construction Work. The improvements that are specified in the following list shall be referred to as the "Primary Mitigation Projects:"

 a. Third Avenue peak period traffic restrictions

 b. Fifth Avenue South transit contra-flow lane

 c. Ninth Avenue transit contra-flow lane

 d. Olive Way transit priority improvements

 e. Prefontaine Place South reconfiguration.

 10.3 Monitoring and Maintaining Bus Performance Levels on Surface Streets

 It is the Parties' intent that the Downtown Seattle Traffic and Street Improvements will be sufficient to maintain bus service performance on surface streets of downtown Seattle, during the Closure Period and after the Tunnel is reopened for bus and train use, at the performance levels similar to those existing prior to the Closure Period. The Parties hereby establish a Monitor and Maintain Committee ("M&M Committee") to be comprised of the designated contacts set forth in Section 20.0, or such contact's designated replacement or alternate. The M&M Committee may be expanded to include participation by other public transit agencies at the discretion of the Parties. The M&M Committee shall conduct baseline studies of bus travel time and passenger convenience, security, safety, and comfort during a measurement period prior to the Closure Period ("Baseline Measurement Period"). The Baseline Measurement Period shall be agreed upon by the project managers identified in Section 20.0, and shall consist of at least sixty (60) Calendar Days so that the influence of individual irregularities in bus service and other aberrations are minimized. The Baseline Measurement Period shall be selected so as to fall as close to the Closure Period as possible while excluding any period in which there is a major modification of the downtown bus service schedule or significant downtown street or utility repairs or projects. During the Closure Period and for one year after the Tunnel is re-opened, the M&M Committee shall continue to monitor downtown Seattle transportation system performance and make recommendations to the Parties to take actions to maintain said system performance. In performing its functions, the Committee shall be directed to (a) consult with and seek the input of downtown Seattle, Seattle neighborhoods, and suburban stakeholders and (b) report quarterly to the City Council's Transportation Committee regarding the performance of the downtown transportation system and regarding the Committee's consultation with the various stakeholders.

 10.4 Changes to Exhibit 3

 An amendment to Exhibit 3 that relates to any of the Primary Mitigation Projects must be approved by the Sound Transit Board and the legislative authorities of the County and the City. Other amendments to Exhibit 3 may be made by written agreement of the Director of the County's Department of Transportation, Executive Director of Sound Transit, and the City Traffic Engineer or their respective designee(s).

 10.5 Design and Construction Responsibilities and Costs

 10.5.1 The Party that is responsible for implementing or completing a Downtown Seattle Traffic and Street Improvement shall be responsible for all aspects of designing, constructing, and/or implementing such improvement or contracting for the design, construction or implementation of such improvement. The Parties shall enter into agreements with each other for each project to further refine their responsibilities with regard to scope, schedule, payments or reimbursements, and other necessary terms.

 10.5.2 Each of the Parties shall provide the other Parties a timely opportunity to review and comment on the designs, plans, and specifications for those Downtown Seattle Traffic and Street Improvements that it is responsible for constructing and/or implementing.

 10.5.3 The Parties agree that whichever of the Parties is responsible for making an improvement is required to obtain all required licenses, easements, and permits for construction and implementation. Consistent with the April 20, 1998 Memorandum of Agreement for Intergovernmental Cooperation for the Central Link Light Rail Transit Project and supplements thereto, the City shall expedite the issuance and granting of all City-required licenses, easements and permits in order to facilitate completion of the Downtown Seattle Traffic and Street Improvements. The Parties shall diligently perform their tasks as specified in Exhibit 3.

 10.5.4 a. Exhibit 3 specifies the maximum amounts that the County and the City shall be required to pay for a Downtown Seattle Traffic and Street Improvement that is one of their responsibilities to implement. Sound Transit shall be responsible for all actual design, permitting, implementation and construction costs associated with the other Downtown Seattle Traffic and Street Improvements in said Exhibit.

 b. Exhibit 3 also provides for a contingency fund that will be established by Sound Transit. The M&M Committee shall be responsible for managing the contingency fund specified in Exhibit 3 and if the cost of a City or County improvement exceeds the maximum cost set forth in said exhibit, the M&M Committee shall direct Sound Transit to use said contingency fund to reimburse the County and the City to cover such excess costs. If the contingency fund is exhausted before the improvements in Exhibit 3 have been completed, the M&M Committee shall propose amendments to the Exhibit. If money remains in the contingency fund after the improvements in Exhibit 3 have been completed and the City and County costs have been fully reimbursed, Sound Transit may use said remaining balance at its discretion.

 10.6 Ownership and Maintenance

 The party designated as the party to own and maintain a Downtown Seattle Traffic and Street Improvement shall provide ongoing maintenance, repair, and replacement of said improvement at no cost to the other two parties except as either or both of them otherwise agree.

 10.7 Minimum Duration of Traffic and Street Improvements

 The Downtown Seattle Traffic and Street Improvements shall remain in place and in effect until at least one year after light rail revenue service is commenced in the Tunnel.

 10.8 City Modification or Removal of Traffic and Street Improvements

 After the completion of said one year period and until such time as Sound Transit operates light rail service to Northgate Station, the City may modify or remove the Downtown Seattle Traffic and Street Improvements, or any portion thereof, only if such modification or removal is within the City's authority and will not degrade downtown bus service performance levels with regard to bus travel time and passenger convenience, security, safety, and comfort.

 Prior to implementing or requiring any modification to or removal of the Primary Mitigation Projects that may potentially result in such degradation, the City's Mayor and City Council shall timely confer with the County Executive and County Council and Sound Transit and allow them a full opportunity to review and comment on such proposed change or removal. Prior to implementing changes to or removal of any other Downtown Seattle Traffic and Street Improvements that may result in such degradation, the City Traffic Engineer shall timely confer with the Director of the County's Department of Transportation and Executive Director of Sound Transit and allow them a full opportunity to review and comment on such proposed change or removal.

 10.9 Agreed Modification or Removal of Traffic and Street Improvements

 A modification to or removal of any Primary Mitigation Projects may occur at any time upon agreement approved by the Sound Transit Board and the legislative authorities of the County and the City. Modification to or removal of other Downtown Seattle Traffic and Street Improvements may occur at any time upon the written agreement of the Director of the County's Department of Transportation, Executive Director of Sound Transit, and the City Traffic Engineer.

 11.0 BUS RELATED COSTS ASSUMED BY SOUND TRANSIT

 11.1 Increased Operating Costs Arising From Tunnel Closure

 In order to compensate the County for additional operating costs of bus routes serving downtown Seattle during the Closure Period, Sound Transit shall pay the County an annual amount of $1.15 million. The first payment due pursuant to this section shall be adjusted by the percentage change that occurred in the CPI for the period that most closely corresponds to the period between September 1, 2004 and the first annual payment. Subsequent payment amounts shall be adjusted by the percentage change that occurred in the CPI during the period that most closely corresponds to the period between the date the last payment was due to the date such subsequent payment is due. The first annual payment shall be due on the Closure Date. Subsequent payments shall be due on that same date each year until the date when County buses resume operating in the Tunnel. Payment for any partial year of Tunnel closure shall be pro-rated based upon the portion of the year in which the Tunnel is closed.

 11.2 County Activities to Support Light Rail Construction

 The County shall complete the Bus Stop and Layover, Trolley Infrastructure and Service Information activities identified in Exhibit 4. Exhibit 4 may be changed by agreement of the County Transit General Manager and Sound Transit Light Rail Director. The County shall manage the work described in Exhibit 4 within the specified budget. Any savings in Bus Stops and Layover, and Service Information shall be applied to any increased costs for Trolley Infrastructure. In the event the cost of Trolley Infrastructure exceeds the amount shown and any savings, Sound Transit shall reimburse the County for the excess expenditures.

 Sound Transit shall reimburse the County for the actual costs the County incurs to conduct other work and activities not identified in Exhibit 4 if such work or activity is requested by Sound Transit or its contractor(s), or required by cities or other permitting agencies or jurisdictions if such requirements are related to Sound Transit's construction activities.

 In the event Sound Transit constructs extensions to its light rail system beyond the Initial Segment, Sound Transit shall reimburse the County for its actual costs of performing work at other locations, similar to the work at the locations described in Exhibit 4.

 11.3 Construction-Related Delay of County Buses

 Sound Transit shall utilize its best efforts to avoid or minimize delays to normal bus operations as a result of Initial Segment light rail construction activities, both in downtown Seattle and elsewhere. Those best efforts shall include, at a minimum, imposing requirements in contract special provisions upon light rail construction contractors for:

 a. Maintenance of normal bus flows past construction sites by keeping traffic lanes open, providing detour lanes, using flaggers, or similar methods as appropriate at each particular site; and

 b. Coordination and advance planning with Sound Transit's CM and the County's and City's staff in connection with changes that may be necessary to bus routes, lane usage, bus stop locations, trolley wire relocations, or other changes affecting normal bus operations as a result of construction activities.

 Notwithstanding Sound Transit's best efforts, it is expected that construction-related delays arising from the development of the Initial Segment will result in the County incurring costs from adding bus trips to the schedule, whether for a single instance, an entire service change period or longer; and/or the provision of more than normal street supervision of bus operations, whether on an overtime basis or by adding shifts. Accordingly, Sound Transit shall pay a total of $550,000 to the County in payments to be made on or before the following dates in general compensation for the County's added costs due to Initial Segment construction-related delays.

 December 31, 2004 $100,000

 December 31, 2005 $125,000

 December 31, 2006 $125,000

 December 31, 2007 $125,000

 December 31, 2008 $ 75,000

 Provided, however, said amounts are not intended to compensate the County for its added costs due to construction related delays that may arise from Sound Transit's development of extensions to its light rail system beyond the Initial Segment. The County and Sound Transit anticipate that a future agreement will address any payments for such delays.

 11.4 Bus Service Planning

 The County's service planning activities and the review of transit facility designs related to light rail between Northgate Station and South 200th St. Station undertaken between January 1, 2003 and December 31, 2009 to support connection of its bus service to Sound Transit's light rail service shall not be subject to reimbursement, notwithstanding the provisions of the Memorandum of Understanding Establishing a Cooperative Relationship Between the Central Puget Sound Regional Transit Authority and King County as they may relate to these activities.

 12.0 SOUND TRANSIT SERVICE IN THE TUNNEL AFTER CLOSURE PERIOD

 12.1 Sound Transit Use of the Tunnel

 Upon reopening of the Tunnel after the Closure Period, Sound Transit's light rail and regional express bus services may be regularly scheduled to operate in the Tunnel in accordance with the terms of this Agreement and an executed Operation and Maintenance ("O&M agreement") and subject to the following maximum allocations:

 Regularly scheduled 10 trains per hour each light rail service direction

 Regularly scheduled 10 buses per hour each regional express bus service direction.

 The County will provide for Sound Transit's light rail and bus use of the Tunnel at the above levels subject to system, structural or other failure/damage and operational disruptions or interferences. Accordingly, the County and Sound Transit agree that nothing in this Agreement shall be construed as creating any liability or obligation on the part of the County for lost revenues or any other consequences or costs arising from the unavailability of the Tunnel for use by light rail or regional express bus service as a result of such interferences or disruptions. The respective obligations of the County and Sound Transit in the event of temporary and long term Tunnel unavailability shall be addressed in the O&M agreement contemplated in Section 16.

 12.2 Reduction/Elimination of Bus Use

 a. If either the County or Sound Transit determines that, as a result of operational problems in the Tunnel, including but not limited to, those arising from increased train operation, fewer total bus trips can be accommodated in the Tunnel, representatives from the County and Sound Transit shall meet and, after conferring with the City, said County and Sound Transit representatives shall determine the number of County bus trips to be removed and the County service change date on which such removal would take effect. The County and Sound Transit shall each provide to the other and to the City at least one hundred eighty (180) Calendar Days advance notice of any need for the County to remove any of its bus trips from the Tunnel.

 b. To the extent County bus trips in the Tunnel are reduced below fifty (50) bus trips per hour in each direction, the County's percentage shares of the following costs, as set forth in their respective sections or agreements, shall be decreased and Sound Transit's percentage shares shall be increased, according to the Schedule of Percentage Contributions attached hereto and made a part hereof as Exhibit 5.

 (1) debt service (Section 14.3.b)

 (2) payments under an amortization schedule for Common Elements (Section 15.3, 4 and 5)

 (3) payments under an amortization schedule for Bus Elements (Section 15.6)

 (4) those costs under the O&M Agreement for which the County pays a percentage share as contemplated by Section 16.4.i

 c. If at any point in time the number of County bus trips in the Tunnel is reduced in accordance with subsection 12.2.a above to less than thirty (30) buses per hour in each direction, the County may, at its sole discretion, remove all County bus service from the Tunnel. Before providing Sound Transit with notice that it intends to remove all County bus trips from the Tunnel, the County shall first confer with Sound Transit and with the City. After such discussion, the County may then remove all of its buses by providing Sound Transit and the City three hundred sixty-five Calendar Days advance notice. In such event, Sound Transit's percentage share shall increase to 100% of the debt service and those costs under the O&M Agreement for which the County pays a percentage share; Section 15 shall be deemed amended to require Sound Transit to reimburse the County monthly for the County's actual costs in making all capital repairs/replacements; and any remaining payments on an amortization schedule for Common Elements and Bus Elements shall become immediately due and payable, in their entirety, by Sound Transit.

 13.0 LOCAL IMPROVEMENT DISTRICT

 13.1 Background and Notice of Any Proposed Reassessment

 A local improvement district ("LID") encompassing properties specially benefited by the Tunnel and related projects was established by Metro. As successor to Metro, the County has administered and shall continue to administer the local improvement district and collect and retain the special assessments. The County shall give timely notice to Sound Transit of any public proceeding regarding any proposed reassessment regarding the LID.

 13.2 Indemnification

 Sound Transit shall defend, indemnify and hold harmless the County, its officials and employees from and against any and all claims, damages, costs, expenses (including reasonable attorney fees), demands, defenses, administrative appeals, causes of action, protests, grievances, and lawsuits (collectively referred to as "Claims") in which it is claimed or alleged that the construction of the Tunnel to enable use by light rail and bus operations, the rerouting of buses to surface streets, Sound Transit's activities, or use and/or modification of the Tunnel or any other action taken pursuant to this Agreement impacts the validity, lawfulness, or collection of the special assessments and/or requires a refund of said assessments, compensation for the taking of property, and/or other payment. Sound Transit's obligations under this section shall extend, but not be limited to, indemnifying and compensating the County for any assessments that must be refunded and/or that would have been collected but for such Claims. Sound Transit's obligations under this section shall not extend to Claims based solely on: 1) any procedural defects on the part of the County in the creation of the local improvement district or in reassessing the properties in the district; or 2) County clerical errors in processing assessment payments.

 14.0 BONDS, TAX COVENANT AND DEBT SERVICE PAYMENTS RELATED TO ORIGINAL TUNNEL DEVELOPMENT

 14.1 Bonds

 Bonds were originally issued in 1986 and 1989 to fund the Downtown Seattle Transit Project and Tunnel construction. Refunding bonds have been subsequently issued (as authorized by Municipality of Metropolitan Seattle Resolutions No. 4937 and No. 6538 and King County Ordinance No. 13128). The original bonds and any and all refunding bonds are hereinafter referred to as the "Bonds." The County shall retain responsibility for making the required debt service payments for the Bonds but Sound Transit shall contribute to said payments as set forth below. Sound Transit assumes no obligation for payment to bondholders or any obligations under the bonds.

 14.2 Tax Exemption of Bonds

 Sound Transit covenants that it will not take or permit to be taken on its behalf any action that would adversely affect the exemption from federal taxation of the interest on the Bonds. Sound Transit will take, or require to be taken, such acts as may reasonably be within its ability and as may from time to time be required under applicable law to continue the exemption from federal income taxation of the interest on the Bonds as requested by the County.

 14.3 Debt Service Payments for the Bonds

 a. Given the County's substantial investment in developing and maintaining the Tunnel in its current condition and given the County's willingness, in accordance with Section 12, to permit Sound Transit's light rail and regional express bus services to benefit from an already existing facility, Sound Transit agrees to make payments equivalent to a percentage of the County's six-month payments of debt service for the Bonds, as set forth in Exhibit 6, or as such payment dates may be changed from time to time to reflect the County's re-financing of the Bonds. The first reimbursement payment by Sound Transit shall be reduced pro rata by the number of Calendar Days in the preceding six-month period during which buses were still operating in the Tunnel.

 b. Sound Transit's percentage shares of said debt service payments shall be as follows:

 for payments due before the Closure Period: 0%

 for payments due during the Closure Period: 100%

 for payments due after the Closure Period but before the start of light rail service simulation 17%

 for payments due after the Closure Period and light rail revenue service simulation has commenced: 40%

 After light rail revenue service simulation has commenced, Sound Transit's percentage share of the County's debt service payments shall be increased as provided in Section 12.2(b). Sound Transit's reimbursement for the first debt service payment due after the County service change that changes its percentage share shall be calculated pro rata: at the old rate for those Calendar Days during the preceding period prior to the service change; and at the new rate for those Calendar Days after the service change date.

 c. Upon the earlier of Sound Transit extending passenger light rail revenue service to Northgate Station or January 1, 2016, Sound Transit shall reimburse the County for 100% of each of the County's subsequent debt service payments consistent with the schedule in Exhibit 6. Provided, however, if the County and Sound Transit determine that it is still feasible to safely and efficiently operate some buses in the Tunnel at such time, the County may, at its sole discretion, opt to continue operating buses in the Tunnel and Sound Transit's 100% reimbursement of debt service shall be reduced by 6% for each five County buses operated per hour in each direction. Sound Transit's reimbursement for the first debt service payment due after the date or event that changes its percentage share shall be calculated pro rata: at the old rate for those Calendar Days during the preceding period prior to the change date or event; and at the new rate for those Calendar Days after the change date or event.

 d. Sound Transit shall wire transfer its reimbursement to the County's account by the close of business on the dates set forth in Exhibit 6, or as such payment dates may be changed from time to time to reflect the County's re-financing of the Bonds.

 e. Sound Transit's contributions to the County's debt service payments as set forth in Exhibit 6 will be reduced to reflect its appropriate shares of the savings of any County refunding of the Bonds. Without obtaining the prior concurrence of Sound Transit, the County will not deviate from a policy of obtaining approximately level annual debt service savings when refunding the Bonds. In no event shall any of Sound Transit's annual contributions to the County's debt service payments increase beyond the levels shown in Exhibit 6 as a result of any such refunding of the Bonds.

 f. Sound Transit shall have the option, in its sole discretion, to prepay its contributions toward debt service payments in whole or in part. At any time after closure of the tunnel, Sound Transit may make a lump sum payment to the County for all or a portion of the outstanding principal on the bonds plus accrued interest on the principal since the last debt service payment date. The County will apply any such lump sum payment received to the retirement or defeasance of a portion of the Bonds and Sound Transit's contributions to the County's debt service payments as set forth in Exhibit 6 shall be reduced to reflect the full impact of such retirement or defeasance on future debt service payments. The County will solicit advice from Sound Transit in the selection of the maturities of the Bonds to be retired or defeased.

 15.0 CAPITAL REPAIRS/REPLACEMENTS AFTER EXECUTION OF THIS AGREEMENT

 15.1 General

 Sound Transit acknowledges that the Tunnel is made available for modification and operation of its service on an "as is" and "with all faults" basis. The Tunnel will have been functioning for seventeen years when Sound Transit plans to commence construction of the light rail improvements in 2007. In order to remain useful as a public transportation facility for an extended period for both bus and light rail operations, the Tunnel may require capital repairs or replacement work, some of which may be needed before, and some of which may be performed as part of, the Closure Period Construction Work. In addition, the Tunnel may require capital repairs or replacement work due to unforeseen failure or damage. Upon the execution of this Agreement, the County and Sound Transit agree to share the responsibility for capital repairs/replacements needed to preserve the Tunnel in good working order as set forth in this Section and in the O&M Agreement contemplated in Section16. Notwithstanding the provisions of this Section, however, nothing in this Agreement shall be construed as requiring the County to undertake capital repair/replacement work with an estimated cost of $5 million or more.

 15.2 Light Rail Elements

 If for any reason, a Light Rail Element requires capital repair/replacement work after the Closure Period, the County shall undertake the design and construction of the necessary work in accordance with the O&M Agreement. Except in emergencies, the County shall inform Sound Transit in advance of undertaking the work and their representatives shall meet to discuss the nature of the work and the estimated cost. Except in cases of emergency, no work for which Sound Transit is financially responsible shall be performed without Sound Transit's prior approval, which shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed. Sound Transit shall reimburse the County monthly for 100% of the costs as they are incurred. The County shall submit a monthly invoice to Sound Transit, which shall pay said invoice within thirty (30) Calendar Days.

 15.3 Common Elements

 15.3.1 If for any reason, a Common Element requires capital repair/replacement work either prior to or after the Closure Period, the County shall undertake the design and construction of the necessary work in accordance with the O&M Agreement, subject to the appropriation of sufficient funds by the County Council. Except in emergencies, the County shall inform Sound Transit in advance of undertaking the work and their representatives shall meet to discuss the nature of the work and the estimated cost.

 15.3.2 The County and Sound Transit have agreed that certain Common Modifications shall be designed, constructed and paid for as part of the Closure Period Construction Work. A list of such Closure Period Common Modifications shall be developed and approved by the Technical Steering Committee under Section 7. If during the Closure Period, an unlisted Common Element requires capital repair/replacement work, and it is not due to construction-related damage or other cause that is the responsibility of Sound Transit under the Construction Agreement contemplated by Section 9.3, the work shall be treated like a pre- Closure Period capital repair/replacement of a Common Element.

 15.4. Amortization Schedule for Pre and Post Closure Period Work on Common Elements

 15.4.1 The actual cost of capital repair/replacement work on a Common Element prior to or after the Closure Period shall include, but is not limited to, all costs related to design, permitting, property interest acquisition, demolition, construction and project management. The actual cost shall be reduced by any payments received from grant funds, insurance proceeds or sources other than the County or Sound Transit for repair/replacement of a Common Element.

 15.4.2 The County shall track and report monthly expenditures for capital repair/replacement work on Common Elements occurring after execution of this Agreement. At the end of each month, interest will be calculated on said cumulative expenditures at the then-current rate for the County investment pool and shall be added to the actual project costs for any project that has a construction duration greater than six months. The actual costs including such capitalized interest ("final cost") of each Common Element shall be calculated by the County as of the date of final acceptance; provided, however, if the County has not determined the final cost of the project, including, but not limited to, the cost of resolving claims arising out of the project, by the date of final acceptance of a Common Element, an estimated cost will be used as the basis for establishing the amortization schedule as provided below. Said schedule shall then be modified to reflect the final cost once it has been determined.

 15.4.3 The County shall develop a schedule of payments that amortizes the final cost of each Common Element, plus capitalized interest, for any project that has a construction duration greater than over six months, over the improvement's useful life, commencing with final acceptance. The length of an improvement's useful life shall be determined by mutual agreement of the County and Sound Transit using standard accounting criteria. The interest rate scale to be used to develop the amortization schedule appropriate for the improvement's useful life shall be the Option-Adjusted Spread Yields for AA General Obligation Municipal Bonds published by Bloomberg (or other financial service agreed upon by the County and Sound Transit) as of the project completion date. Payments shall not be more frequent than quarterly, but the timing of all payments under the various Common Element schedules may be coordinated and changed into quarterly payments.

 15.4.4 The County and Sound Transit have attached hereto and made a part hereof as Exhibit 7, an illustrative example of how to create an amortization schedule for each of two Common Elements.

 15.5 Sharing Costs of Pre- and Post-Closure Period Work on Common Elements

 15.5.1 The County shall pay the up-front actual costs of each repair/replacement of a Common Element before or after the Closure Period Work, provided the cost for any given project is not estimated to exceed $5 Million. Depending on an improvement's date of final acceptance, the amortization schedule could commence on a date before, during or after the Closure Period. Sound Transit shall make a consolidated quarterly payment to the County for all payments due for its share of Common Element improvement equal to its then current share of contributions to debt service payments under Section 14.3.b. Sound Transit's obligations to make contributions toward Common Element improvements shall begin at the commencement of the Closure Period. Provided, however, Sound Transit's percentage share of each payment on the amortization schedule may be increased as provided for in Section 12.2.

 15.5.2 If the actual costs of repairing or replacing a Common Element before or after the Closure Period are estimated to exceed $5 Million, the County and Sound Transit shall meet to determine the method by which such work will be financed and the costs shared over time.

 15.5.3 In the event the Tunnel is conveyed to Sound Transit, all remaining payments under the amortization schedules shall be accelerated and Sound Transit shall pay its applicable share of same as of the date of the conveyance.

 15.6 Bus Elements

 15.6.1 In the event the Technical Steering Committee agrees that there are Bus Elements in the Tunnel after the Closure Period, the County shall undertake the design and construction of any capital repair/replacement work necessary for such elements in accordance with the O&M Agreement, subject to the appropriation of sufficient funds by the County Council. Except in emergencies, the County shall inform Sound Transit in advance of undertaking the work and their representatives shall meet to discuss the nature of the work and the estimated cost. Except in cases of emergency, no work for which Sound Transit is financially responsible shall be performed without Sound Transit's prior approval.

 15.6.2 The actual cost of capital repair/replacement work on a Bus Element after the Closure Period shall include, but is not limited to, all costs related to design, permitting, property interest acquisition, demolition, construction and project management. The actual cost shall be reduced by any payments received from grant funds, insurance proceeds or sources other than the County or Sound Transit for repair/replacement of a Bus Element.

 15.6.3 The County shall track and report monthly expenditures for capital repair/replacement work on Bus Elements occurring after execution of this Agreement. At the end of each month, interest will be calculated on said cumulative expenditures at the then-current rate for the County investment pool and shall be added to the actual project costs for any project that has a construction duration of greater than six months. The actual costs including such capitalized interest ("final cost") of each Bus Element shall be calculated by the County as of the date of final acceptance; provided, however, if the County has not determined the final cost of the project, including, but not limited to, the cost of resolving claims arising out of the project, by the date of final acceptance of a Bus Element, an estimated cost will be used as the basis for establishing the amortization schedule as provided below. Said schedule shall then be modified to reflect the final cost once it has been determined.

 15.6.4 The County shall develop a schedule of payments that amortizes the final cost of each Bus Element, plus capitalized interest for any project that has a construction duration greater than six months, over the improvement's useful life, commencing with final acceptance. The length of an improvement's useful life shall be determined by mutual agreement of the County and Sound Transit using standard accounting criteria. The interest rate scale to be used to develop the amortization schedule appropriate for the improvement's useful life shall be the Option-Adjusted Spread Yields for AA General Obligation Municipal Bonds published by Bloomberg (or other financial service agreed upon by the County and Sound Transit) as of the project completion date. Payments shall not be more frequent than quarterly, but the timing of all payments under the various Bus Element schedules may be coordinated and changed into quarterly payments.

 15.6.5 The County shall pay the up-front actual costs of each repair/replacement of a Bus Element after the Closure Period Work, provided the costs for any given project is not estimated to exceed $5 Million. Sound Transit shall pay to the County 17% of each payment that is due pursuant to each Bus Element's amortization schedule. Provided, however, Sound Transit's percentage share of each payment on the amortization schedule may be increased by 8.3% for each five County buses removed as provided in Section 12.2(b). Sound Transit obligations to make contributions toward Bus Element improvements shall begin with the commencement of the Closure Period.

 15.6.6 If the actual costs of repairing or replacing a Bus Element is estimated to exceed $5 Million, the County and Sound Transit shall meet to determine the method by which such work will be financed and the costs shared over time.

 15.6.7 In the event the Tunnel is conveyed to Sound Transit, all remaining payments under the amortization schedules shall be accelerated and Sound Transit shall pay its applicable share of same as of the date of the conveyance.

 15.7 Prepayment

 15.7.1 Sound Transit shall have the right, in its sole discretion, to prepay any or all of its obligations due the County for Common Element improvements or Bus Elements given Sound Transit's then applicable percentage share. On any quarterly payment date, Sound Transit shall have the right to make a lump sum payment, equal to its share of the outstanding depreciated value of Common Element improvements and/or Bus Elements, plus accrued interest since the last quarterly payment date. Provided, however, such prepayment shall not release Sound Transit from the differential between such pre-paid shares and the actual shares that may subsequently become due on an element's amortization schedule if Sound Transit's percentage share increases.

 15.8 Indemnification and Insurance

 The County and Sound Transit shall develop, as part of the O&M Agreement, a program for indemnification, self-insurance, insurance and adjusting/defending liability claims arising out of the design and construction of repairs/replacement work undertaken under this Section 15.
