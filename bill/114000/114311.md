 AN ORDINANCE relating to employees of the Department of Parks and Recreation, Zoo Program, authorizing the withdrawal of certain amounts from the City Employees' Retirement System and amending Chapter 4.36 of the Seattle Municipal Code.

 WHEREAS, City of Seattle Ordinance 120697 approved an agreement between the City and the Woodland Park Zoological Society (the "Zoo Society") whereby the Zoo Society assumed responsibility for the operation and management of the Woodland Park Zoo over a renewable twenty-year period, beginning March 1, 2002 (the "Operations and Management Agreement"); and

 WHEREAS the Operations and Management Agreement specifically provides for the development of an Employee Transition Plan by December 31, 2002 to address, among other things, a means for transferring the value of the pension benefits of Zoo employees who transition to Zoo Society employment; and

 WHEREAS, the transition of Department of Parks and Recreation employees currently assigned to the Zoo from City employment to Zoo Society employment will assist the Zoo Society in fully and efficiently executing its responsibilities under the Operations and Management Agreement; and

 WHEREAS, the City Council finds that allowing City employees assigned to the Zoo to make certain withdrawals from the City Employees' Retirement System upon such employees' transition to Zoo Society employment is in the best interests of the City, the City employees assigned to the Zoo, the Woodland Park Zoo, and the Zoo Society and would facilitate an expeditious and efficient transition of employment resources from the City to the Zoo Society; and

 WHEREAS, the actuary for the City issued a written opinion concluding that the effect on the Retirement System of withdrawals by City employees assigned to the Zoo, consistent with the terms set forth in this Ordinance, would be substantially neutral and would not adversely affect the Plan's funding.

 NOW, THEREFORE,

 BE IT ORDAINED BY THE CITY OF SEATTLE AS FOLLOWS:

 Section 1. A new section is added to the Seattle Municipal Code as follows:

 4.36.199 Zoo Employees Transitioning to Woodland Park Zoological Society Employment.

 A. Authority. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Chapter 4.36, a member separating from City employment with the Department of Parks and Recreation, Zoo Program, pursuant to the ordinance introduced as Council Bill 114313, shall be eligible for those benefits to which he or she is entitled under the provisions of this chapter, or, in lieu of such benefits, such member may elect to take the lump sum payout as provided in this section. If such member elects to take the lump sum payout as provided herein, he or she must make written application therefor. If all of the conditions set forth herein are met, the Board of Administration shall, consistent with its rules and procedures, provide the member with a lump sum payout equal to the member's accumulated contributions plus interest calculated at 5.75% per annum, plus an additional amount (approximating the City's contributions on behalf of that member) equal to the member's accumulated contributions plus interest calculated at 5.75% per annum. The member may elect to have the payment made directly to a specified eligible retirement plan pursuant to Section 4.36.193.

 B. Conditions and Application. The member's application shall be filed with the Board of Administration no later than December 3, 2002 and accompanied by proof that the member has irrevocably elected to separate from City employment under the terms of the Separation Incentive Program -- Zoo Program established pursuant to the ordinance introduced as Council Bill 114313.

 Section 2. Subsection 4.36.190 B 3 of the Seattle Municipal Code is amended as follows:

 SMC 4.36.190 Discontinuance or reentrance of eligible employee -- Purchase of creditable service.

 ***

 B. Redeposit and Purchase of Creditable Service.

 ***

 3. If a member within two (2) years after reentering the retirement system after a termination of his or her membership does not make such a redeposit or file a properly executed redeposit contract, he or she may purchase all, or some part of, his or her former creditable service only by paying into the retirement fund the amount, or some part thereof, he or she previously withdrew plus compound interest as determined by the Board. The following provisions apply to redeposits made pursuant to this subsection SMC 4.36.190 B3:

 a. Determination of applicable interest rates. The interest rate for each year since the date of withdrawal of contributions shall be the greater of the rate the retirement fund has earned, net of fees, as reported by the Retirement System's Investment Performance Consultant, or the interest rate equivalent to the actuarial assumed rate of investment return at the time of executing the redeposit contract.

 b. Calculation of "accumulated contributions." For purposes of determining a member's accumulated contributions pursuant to SMC 4.36.030 B, only a portion of the total amount deposited shall be considered. The portion to be considered as the member's accumulated contributions shall be only the amount previously withdrawn as the member's contributions including interest, plus interest calculated at the actuarial assumed rate of investment return.

 c. Withdrawal of contributions limited. The total amount deposited for the purchase of said former creditable service will be available for withdrawal by the member only if the member terminates employment with the City and withdraws his or her total accumulated contributions prior to retirement or dies and benefits are not payable under subsections 4.36.270 B and C. In the event such redeposit is made by a member, his rate of contribution shall be as determined under Section 4.36.110 A, and the City shall reinstate all, or that part of, the former creditable service purchased by the member.

 Section 7. Any acts made consistent with the authority and prior to the effective date of this ordinance are hereby ratified and confirmed.

 Section 8. This ordinance shall take effect and be in force thirty (30) days from and after its approval by the Mayor, but if not approved and returned by the Mayor within ten (10) days after presentation, it shall take effect as provided by Municipal Code Section 1.04.020.
