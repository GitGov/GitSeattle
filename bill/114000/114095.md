 Section 2. Article III, Section 13 of the Agreement is amended as follows:

 Section 13. Refinancing. The City reserves the right to request the Authority to redeem or defease the Bonds if the City reasonably determines that in order to provide funds with which to redeem or defease the Bonds, the Authority is able to issue and sell refunding bonds or to obtain other refinancing, which provides a net interest savings (after consideration of the cost of issuance) to the Authority, in either case without the unconditional obligation to make payments similar to those of the City contained in Section 6 hereof. If the City makes such a request, the Authority shall use its best efforts to obtain a contract for the purchase of such bonds or obtain other refinancing, in either case without the unconditional obligation of the City to make payments similar to those contained in Section 6 hereof. If the Authority is able to obtain such a bond purchase contract or other refinancing, the Authority shall issue and sell such refunding bonds or obtain such other refinancing, shall call the Bonds for redemption and shall pay and redeem the bonds.

 The parties agree that the Authority shall issue refunding bonds in an aggregate principal amount not to exceed $7,000,000 $11,000,000 (the "Refunding Bonds") in order to provide funds to refund $6,045,000 aggregate principal amount a portion of the Series 1991 1987 Bonds presently Outstanding in the aggregate principal amount of $____________ and $8,400,000 to pay the costs of such refunding, and to make available additional funds for use by the Authority. Prior to the issuance of the Refunding Bonds, the City Attorney shall approve the terms and conditions of the Authority's resolutions authorizing the issuance of the Refunding Bonds shall be subject to the approval of the Seattle City Attorney, which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld. The Refunding Bonds shall be secured by the Authority's pledge of Gross Net Parking Revenues subject to payment of operation and maintenance costs and by the unconditional obligation of the City to make payments in accordance with the Depository Agreement dated as of March 1, 2002 among the City, the Authority and U.S. Bank National Association (the "Depository Agent") to the Depository Paying Agent for deposit into the Bond Fund with respect to the Refunding Bonds as provided in Section 6 hereof in amounts sufficient together with other funds available therefor, to make scheduled payments of principal of and interest on the Refunding Bonds. The dates, terms, conditions, interest rate or rates and other features of the Refunding Bonds shall initially be determined by the Authority in its sole discretion; provided, that such features shall be reasonably consistent with the Project's Updated Pro Forma Financial Statements attached hereto as Exhibit C and incorporated herein by this reference and prevailing market conditions, and the DMPAC shall have a reasonable opportunity to review and approve such features. The Authority shall make all changes in the terms, conditions and other features of the Refunding Bonds requested by DMPAC prior to the issuance of the Refunding Bonds. Except as limited by law, the Ordinance and this Agreement, the Authority shall be exclusively responsible for the management of the proceeds of the Refunding Bonds and shall invest such proceeds in such investments as the Authority is legally authorized to make and in such manner as is consistent with Sections 8, 9 and 10 of this Agreement and shall dedicate all such investments and earnings thereon to the refunding of the Series 1991 1987 Bonds and other purposes of the Authority. The Authority shall irrevocably call the Series 1991 1987 Bonds chosen for redemption and set aside proceeds of the Refunding Bonds to cause such the Series 1991 1987 Bonds to be defeased.

 Section 3. Ongoing Disclosure. A new Article is added to the Agreement entitled "Continuing Disclosure" due to the City being an "obligated person" with respect to the Refunding Bonds under the Rule (as defined herein), to read as follows:

 Continuing Disclosure.

 A. Disclosure. This Article constitutes the written undertaking (the "Undertaking") for the benefit of the holders of the Refunding Bonds as required by paragraph (b)(5) of United States Securities and Exchange Commission (the "SEC") Rule 15c2-12 (the "Rule"). For purposes of this Undertaking, the term "holders of the Refunding Bonds" shall have the meaning intended for such term under the Rule. The City as an "obligated person" within the meaning of the Rule undertakes to provide or cause to be provided, either directly or through a designated agent:

 (1) To each nationally recognized municipal securities information repository designated by the SEC in accordance with the Rule (each "NRMSIR"), and to a state information depository, if one is established in the State of Washington and recognized by the SEC (the "SID"), annual financial information and operating data regarding the City of the type included, or incorporated by reference, in the Official Statement for the Refunding Bonds as follows: (i) annual financial statements of the City, prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles applicable to governmental units (except as otherwise noted therein), as such principles may be changed from time to time and as permitted by State law, which statements will not be audited, except that if and when audited financial statements are otherwise prepared and available to the City they will be provided; (ii) a statement of authorized, issued and outstanding general obligation debt of the City; (iii) the assessed value of the property within the City subject to ad valorem taxation; and (iv) ad valorem tax levy rates and amounts and percentage of taxes collected.

 Annual financial information, as described above, will be provided to each NRMSIR and the SID not later than the last day of the ninth month after the end of each fiscal year of the City (currently, a fiscal year ending December 31), as such fiscal year may be changed as permitted or required by State law, commencing with the City's fiscal year ending December 31, 2002. The annual financial information maybe provided in a single or in multiple documents, and may be incorporated by reference from other documents, including official statements of debt issues with respect to which the City is an obligated person as defined by the Rule, which documents have been filed with each NRMSIR and the SID. If the document incorporated by reference is a "final official statement" (as defined by the Rule) with respect to which the City is an obligated person, it must be available from the Municipal Securities Rulemaking Board ("MSRB"). The City will clearly identify each such other document so incorporated by reference.

 (2) To each NRMSIR or to the MSRB, and to the SID timely notice of a failure by the City to provide required annual financial information on or before the date specified in paragraph A(1) above.

 B. Amendment. This Undertaking may be amended without the consent of any owner of any Refunding Bond, any broker, dealer, municipal securities dealer, participating underwriter, rating agency, NRMSIR, the SID or the MSRB, under the circumstances and in the manner permitted by the Rule. The City will give notice to each NRMSIR or the MSRB, and the SID, of the substance (or provide a copy) of any amendment to the Undertaking and a brief statement of the reasons for the amendment. If the amendment changes the type of annual financial information to be provided, the annual financial information containing the amended information will include a narrative explanation of the effect of that change on the type of information to be provided.

 C. Compliance. If the City fails to comply with this Undertaking, the City will proceed with due diligence to cause such noncompliance to be corrected as soon as practicable after the City learns of that failure. No failure by the City or other obligated person to comply with this Undertaking shall constitute a default with respect to the Refunding Bonds. The sole remedy of the Authority and of any holder of a Refunding Bond will be to take such actions as the Authority or that holder deems necessary and appropriate to compel the City or other obligated person to comply with this Undertaking.

 D. Beneficiaries. This Undertaking shall inure to the benefit of the City, the Authority and any holder of the Refunding Bonds, and shall not inure to the benefit of or create any rights in any other person.

 E. Termination. The City's obligations under the Undertaking described in this Article shall terminate upon the legal defeasance, prior redemption or payment in full of the then outstanding Refunding Bonds. In addition, the Undertaking, or any provision thereof, will be null and void if the City (i) obtains an opinion of nationally recognized bond counsel or other counsel familiar with federal securities laws to the effect that those portions of the Rule which require the City to comply with the Undertaking, or any such provision, are invalid, have been repealed retroactively or otherwise do not apply to the Bonds; and (ii) notifies the SID and either the MSRB or each NRMSIR of such termination.

 F. Notification to Authority. The City shall make reasonable efforts to provide to the Authority any notice that the City makes under 17 C.F.R. Section 240.15c2-12(b)(5)(i)(C)-(6) and (11), provided that the City's failure to provide such notice to the Authority shall not result in any responsibility or liability whatsoever to the Authority or any other person or entity, and shall not affect or change in any way the rights, duties and responsibilities of the City or the Authority under this Agreement. This Paragraph (F) of Article _____ does not constitute a part of the City's Undertaking for the benefit of the holders of the Refunding Bonds.

 Section 4. The new Exhibit C entitled "Updated Pro Forma Financial Statements" attached hereto shall supercede Exhibit C to the Agreement, as last amended.

 Section 5. Upon payment in full of the 1991 Bonds, amounts remaining in the debt service reserve account with respect to the 1991 Bonds shall be transferred into the debt service reserve account with respect to the 2002 Bonds to the extent required to meet the Debt Service Reserve Requirement with respect to the 2002 Bonds.

 Section 6. All other terms and conditions of the Agreement are hereby ratified and confirmed.

 Section 7. This Agreement shall become effective as of the date first written above upon execution by the Mayor and the chairman of the Council of the Authority.

 IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the City and the Authority have executed this Third Amendment on the respective dates set forth below.
