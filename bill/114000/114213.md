 ORDINANCE __________________

 AN ORDINANCE vacating a portion of West Hayes Street in the Southwest Quarter of Section 23, Township 25 North, Range 3 East, W.M. on the petition of Seattle Department of Parks and Recreation and Anna Bowlds; finding the vacation together with the transfer of certain Park property necessary and authorizing the exchange of certain City- owned property for equivalent other property to be used as open space; and accepting deeds for said property.

 WHEREAS, there has been filed with the City Council the petition of Seattle Department of Parks and Recreation and Anna Bowlds, Clerk File 304990 for the vacation of a portion of West Hayes Street in the Southwest Quarter of Section 23, Township 25 North, Range 3 East W.M., as herein fully described; and

 WHEREAS, the Seattle Department of Parks and Recreation and Anna Bowlds have proposed an exchange of property subject to Ordinance 118477; and

 WHEREAS, the Seattle Department of Parks and Recreation and Anna Bowlds have petitioned for the vacation and proposed the property exchange to resolve a long-standing property line issue which was the result of prior City of Seattle actions, and to acquire property for open space;

 WHEREAS, in 1910, certain land was acquired by the City of Seattle for Magnolia Way W by condemnation under Ordinance 24332, using Park Funds, and said land, excluding W. Hayes Street, was accepted "for park drive and boulevard uses", and

 WHEREAS, in 1959, the City determined that a portion of the land acquired by said Condemnation Ordinance 24332 was not needed, and authorized the reconveyance of a portion of Magnolia Way West lying north of W. Hayes Street by Ordinance 88527, and in 1976, the City also authorized reconveyance of a portion of Magnolia Way West lying immediately south of W. Hayes Street by Ordinance 105504, and

 WHEREAS, the practical effect of those reconveyances was that a portion of W. Hayes Street has the appearance of a private driveway to the property abutting on the east

 and the undeveloped park land has hindered the development, improvement, and use of the adjacent private property; and

 WHEREAS, a land trade involving the park land and the portions of vacated street right-of-way attaching thereto will accommodate development, improvement, and use of the adjacent lands, both public and private; and

 WHEREAS, in accordance with the requirements of Ordinance 118477 (a.k.a. Initiative 42), the City Council has held a public hearing regarding the necessity of this action; and the City has identified land to replace the park property, such land being equivalent or better in size, value, location and usefulness and in the same vicinity, serving the same community and the same park purpose as the park land to be transferred; and

 WHEREAS, a public hearing on said vacation petition was held on April 16, 2002; and

 WHEREAS, the City Council decision on the conditional approval of the vacation was based on the adopted Street Vacation Policies that provided that the land use code, SEPA regulations, and other City codes will be relied on to regulate post-vacation development; and

 WHEREAS, pursuant to Section 35.79.030, RCW, Seattle Municipal Code Chapter 15.62, and as a condition of this street vacation the petitioner has granted property of better value to the City, the appraised value of the property approved for vacation, the property to be transferred, and the property to be accepted in exhange, all according to an appraisal obtained by the Seattle Department of Parks and Recreation;
