For purposes of this Chapter, Marion Oliver McCaw Hall does not include the Lecture Hall at Marion Oliver McCaw Hall. The fee shall be collected each time a person attends an event, and shall be used to pay the costs of health and safety measures at the Marion Oliver McCaw Hall and for no other purpose.

 B. The fee authorized by this section shall be first imposed no earlier than July 1, 2004 and no later than July 1, 2006.

 17.22.020 Calculation of Fee

 The Director of the Seattle Center shall calculate the amount of the fee authorized by this Chapter so as to ensure that the costs incidental to the health and safety measures at the facility are spread equally among persons attending events at the facility. The Director may from time to time recompute the fee to reflect increased or decreased costs of regulation.

 17.22.030 Fee Cap Adjusted For Inflation

 Beginning on July 1, 2005, and on July 1st of each year thereafter, the maximum amount of the fee authorized by this Chapter shall be increased by the percentage increase (if any) in the Consumer Price Index for All Urban Consumers Seattle-Tacoma-Bremerton WA Metropolitan Area, as published by the U.S. Department of Labor, Bureau of Labor Statistics, or its successor, that occurred during the immediately preceding calendar year.

 Section 3. The Director of the Seattle Center is authorized to administer the provisions of this ordinance and to collect the fee, and to utilize agents to assist in carrying out these responsibilities. The costs of health and safety measures at Marion Oliver McCaw Hall shall be separately accounted for, and the regulatory fee authorized herein shall be deposited, in the Seattle Center Operating Fund.

 Section 4. This ordinance shall take effect and be in force thirty (30) days from and after its approval by the Mayor, but if not approved and returned by the Mayor within ten (10) days after presentation, it shall take effect as provided by Municipal Code Section 1.04.020.
