 WHEREAS, Seattle Public Utilities provides wholesale water service to many water utilities surrounding Seattle ("Wholesale Customers") under the provisions of various contracts; and

 WHEREAS, the amount of the new service fees is based in part on Seattle Public Utilities' investments in new water supplies; and

 WHEREAS, the City has determined that it will not participate in the Second Supply Project, thereby decreasing Seattle Public Utilities' investments in new water supplies; and
