 AN ORDINANCE relating to indigent public defense services.

 WHEREAS, it is a constitutional requirement, a requirement of Chapter 10.101 RCW and a public purpose that each person charged with a crime punishable by incarceration or involved in certain other proceedings that may result in loss of liberty or loss of fundamental rights, be provided with effective legal representation in order to ensure equal justice under law without regard to his or her ability to pay; and

 WHEREAS, effective legal representation should be provided consistent with the constitutional requirements of fairness, equal protection, and due process in all cases where the right to counsel attaches; and

 WHEREAS, it is the intention of The City of Seattle (the "City"), consistent with Chapter 10.101 RCW and other applicable law, to make such services available in an efficient manner which provides effective representation at reasonable cost to the city; and

 WHEREAS, the provision of indigent public defense services by nonprofit service providers helps ensure a client focus by those entrusted with representing indigent persons; and

 WHEREAS, a non-profit board of directors is generally representative of the community it serves, and the City Council desires Seattle's public defense program to be representative of the community it serves; and

 WHEREAS, the American Bar Association recommends an average of 6 hours per case bringing the optimum number of cases handled to 275 per year; and

 WHEREAS, the King County Bar Indigent Defense Services Task Force developed a 300 case per attorney, per year guideline in 1982; and

 WHEREAS the Seattle City Council adopted Resolution 27696 on September 28, 1987, adopting a framework and schedule for implementing recommendations contained in the 1987 Public Defender Salary and Caseload Review conducted by City Council staff, which report led to a 1989 City Council Budget Intent Statement (attached as Attachment 1 and incorporated herein by reference) establishing a 380 case per- attorney, per-year limit, and conditions leading to those recommendation have not materially changed; and

 WHEREAS, the City is guided by the standards referenced in Chapter 10.101 RCW and the American Bar Association's Ten Principles of a Public Defense Delivery System attached as Attachment 2 and incorporated herein by reference;

 NOW THEREFORE,

 BE IT ORDAINED BY THE CITY OF SEATTLE AS FOLLOWS:

 Section 1. The selection of service providers for indigent public defense services and the award of contracts with those providers shall be made by the Director of Executive Administration upon the recommendation of a proposal review panel. This panel shall include community members with legal expertise as well as those who hold firm the interests of low-income communities. Except as provided in Section 4 of this Ordinance, the City shall enter into agreements to provide indigent defense services only with nonprofit corporations formed for the express purpose of providing legal services to persons eligible for representation through a public defense program.

 Section 2. The City hereby reaffirms the caseload standards established in the 1989 Budget Intent Statement. The 1989 Budget Intent Statement, the American Bar Association's Ten Principles of a Public Defense Delivery System and the provisions of Section 1 of this Ordinance shall collectively constitute "standards for public defense services" as that term is used in RCW 10.101.030 until such time as the City Council may by ordinance adjust those standards. Consistent with the 1989 Budget Intent Statement, City agreements with indigent public defense service providers shall require caseloads no higher than 380 cases per-attorney per-year. The City also affirms the Washington State Bar- endorsed supervision standard of one full-time supervisor for every ten staff lawyers.

 Section 3. Any new standards for public defense services established by ordinance as contemplated by RCW 10.101.030 relating to "compensation of counsel, duties and responsibilities of counsel, case load limits and types of cases, responsibility for expert witness fees and other costs associated with representation, administrative expenses, support services, reports of attorney activity and vouchers, training, supervision, monitoring and evaluation of attorneys, substitution of attorneys or assignment of contracts, limitations on private practice of contract attorneys, qualifications of attorneys, disposition of client complaints, cause for termination of contract or removal of attorney, and nondiscrimination," shall be the outcome of a comprehensive review that involves the Executive, the City Council, Public Defenders, Law School faculty, and King County Bar Association, and non-profit community service providers.

 Section 4. The Director of Executive Administration shall negotiate the terms of each proposed agreement with a service provider for indigent public defense services consistent with the standards adopted in Section 2 of this Ordinance and consistent with the provisions of Section 1 of this Ordinance. The Director of Executive Administration may execute agreements for that purpose not exceeding three years.

 Section 5. In cases or other proceedings where conflicts of interest or other special circumstances exist, the City may provide for assigned counsel services by persons or entities other than nonprofit corporations.

 Section 6. This ordinance shall take effect and be in force thirty (30) days from and after its approval by the Mayor, but if not approved and returned by the Mayor within ten (10) days after presentation, it shall take effect as provided by Municipal Code Section 1.04.020.
