 ORDINANCE __________

 AN ORDINANCE relating to video cameras in police squad cars; directing the Seattle Police Department to purchase and install video cameras in squad cars for the purpose of monitoring activities within the view of those cameras; reducing an appropriation in the 2002 budget of the Office of Policy and Management and reappropriating that money to the Seattle Police Department to purchase the aforementioned video cameras.

 WHEREAS the City is committed to policing procedures that are fair, equitable and constitutional; and

 WHEREAS in Resolution 30223, the City condemned racial profiling in policing procedures, which is defined in the Resolution as the use of race or ethnicity as a factor in deciding to stop and question, arrest or search a persons without a legal basis under the United States and Washington State Constitutions; and

 WHEREAS in Resolution 30223, the City authorized the creation of the Citizen Task Force on Racial Profiling to work with City agencies and academics to propose a design for a racial profiling data collection process to the City Council; and

 WHEREAS the Citizen Task Force members performed a great service to the citizens of Seattle by devoting their time, energies and intellect to studying data collection programs designed to examine racial based profiling; and

 WHEREAS the report to the City Council issued by the Citizen Task Force recommended a proposed data collection system, as requested by the City Council, but contained discussions about the use of data collection systems in other jurisdictions that suggested that the data collected does not prove or disprove whether law enforcement engages in racial profiling; and

 WHEREAS the installation of video cameras and audio recording devices in police vehicles, if used during all stops of vehicles or pedestrians for whatever purpose, would advance the City's commitment to fair, equitable and constitutional policing procedures by identifying the individuals involved in the stop and providing a record of what transpired during the stop; and

 WHEREAS the installation of video cameras and audio recording devices in police vehicles, if used during stops, further the City's commitment to policing procedures that are fair, equitable and constitutional; and

 WHEREAS the City of Seattle has limited funds to pay for cameras in police vehicles at this time and therefore considers this an intermediate step towards a goal of full deployment of cameras in police vehicles; and

 WHEREAS the cameras purchased with the funding in this ordinance, including $30,000 in previously allocated funds to SPD, are not part of the current video camera pilot project and their use should not be discontinued after the video pilot project is completed; and NOW, THEREFORE,

 BE IT ORDAINED BY THE CITY OF SEATTLE AS FOLLOWS:

 Section 1. The Seattle Police Department (SPD) is directed to purchase and install twenty-five (25) video cameras in police vehicles within six (6) months of the effective date of this ordinance. The cameras will be used to record all vehicle and pedestrian stops except for those activities prohibited under Seattle Municipal Code Chapter 14.12.

 Section 2. To pay for the cost of the cameras referred to in Section 1 of this Ordinance, the

 appropriation for the following line of business in the 2002 Budget of the SPD is increased as follows:

 Fund Line of Business Amount General Subfund Police Administration $105,000

 by reducing the appropriation for the following line of business in the 2002 Budget of the Office of Policy and Management (OPM) in the Executive Department:

 Fund Line of Business Amount General Subfund Office of Policy and Management $105,000

 Unspent appropriation authority in this ordinance shall carry forward into 2003 unless expressly abandoned by ordinance.

 Section 3. SPD is directed to train all officers using vehicles installed with video cameras on how to operate both the video and audio portions of the equipment. At a minimum, for those vehicles in which the video cameras are installed and operating, officers will activate both the audio and video portions of the cameras for all vehicle stops, from the time of initial contact to the conclusion of every stop. Pedestrian stops should be recorded to the maximum extent feasible.

 Section 4. Prior to operating and deploying the cameras, SPD shall present its proposed training and operation protocols for the cameras, including a proposal for where the cameras will be deployed, to the Police, Fire, Courts and Technology Committee for approval.

 Section 5. The tapes should be reviewed when complaints are received and when they are needed for evidentiary review. They may also be used for police training purposes and conducting random audits by SPD management, the Office of Professional Accountability, the Office of Professional Accountability Auditor, and the Office of Professional Accountability Review Board so long as the use is consistent with the roles and responsibilities of the respective parties.

 Section 6. To the extent permitted by law, SPD shall allow members of the public who have been video taped during a police stop to review the specific incident on the tape that they were involved in. SPD shall also develop procedures for responding to public requests that are in accordance with Washington State's public disclosure laws and other relevant statutes pertaining to the disclosure of such video and audio tapes.

 Section 7. This ordinance shall take effect and be in force thirty (30) days from and after its approval by the Mayor, but if not approved and returned by the Mayor within ten (10) days after presentation, it shall take effect as provided by Municipal Code Section 1.04.020.
