 AN ORDINANCE relating to the I-90 Corridor, authorizing the Mayor to execute an amendment to the 1976 Memorandum Agreement that adopts principles regarding future development of the I-90 Corridor between I-5 and I-405.

 WHEREAS, in November 1996, the voters of the three-county Sound Transit district approved Sound Move, the ten-year regional transit system plan; and

 WHEREAS, Sound Transit (formally known as the Central Puget Sound Regional Transit Authority) is proceeding to implement the Sound Move plan; and

 WHEREAS, an integral part of Sound Transit's Regional Express program, which implements portions of the Sound Move plan, is a project to provide an all-day, two-way transit and high-occupancy vehicle (HOV) facility on I-90 between Seattle and the east side of Lake Washington; and

 WHEREAS, on April 25, 2003, Sound Transit, the Washington State Department of Transportation, and the Federal Highway Administration issued a draft environmental impact statement to satisfy the requirements of both the National Environmental Policy Act and the Washington State Environmental Policy Act; and

 WHEREAS, on July 14, 2003, the Seattle City Council adopted Resolution 30613 relating to the I-90 Two-Way Transit and HOV Operations project; and

 WHEREAS, on May 21, 2004, the Final Environmental Impact Statement for the I-90 Two-Way Transit and HOV Operations project was issued; and

 WHEREAS, the City of Seattle has a significant interest and stake in the outcome of the I-90 Two -Way Transit and HOV Operations project; and

 WHEREAS, the parties to the 1976 Memorandum Agreement, the execution of which was authorized by Ordinance 106077, agree that Alternative R- 8a with High Capacity Transit deployed in the center lanes is the ultimate configuration for I-90 in this segment; and

 WHEREAS, construction of the R-8A alignment shall commence once Alternative R-8A is adopted through an amendment to the 1976 Memorandum Agreement, and the funding is acquired, and this shall be the first step toward the ultimate configuration; and

 WHEREAS, dependent upon the outcome of ongoing and future studies and upon the acquisition of funding, the center roadway is to be converted to two-way High Capacity Transit operation; and

 WHEREAS, the City of Seattle is committed to the principles of the 1976 Memorandum Agreement, which specifically limit the facility to "accommodate no more than eight motor vehicle lanes" with no more than "three general-purpose lanes in each direction," and notes that the Amendment to the 1976 Memorandum Agreement does not change that configuration; and

 WHEREAS, the City of Seattle is committed to seeking funding for the implementation of High Capacity Transit simultaneously with the implementation of Alternative R-8A; and

 WHEREAS, the City of Seattle considers light rail transit as the preferred technology for High Capacity Transit operations in the I-90 corridor; and

 WHEREAS, the City of Seattle wants to ensure that key policy principles are articulated in an amendment to the 1976 Memorandum Agreement (1976 Memorandum Agreement attached hereto as Attachment 1) prior to implementation of the I-90 Two-Way Transit and HOV Operations project; NOW, THEREFORE,

 Attachment 1: 1976 Memorandum Agreement (filed with Ordinance 106077)

 Attachment 2: Amendment to 1976 Memorandum Agreement 6/22/04 v4 t

 Amendment to 1976 Memorandum Agreement

 WHEREAS, the Cities of Seattle, Mercer Island and Bellevue; King County; by and through their respective governing bodies and the Washington State Transportation Commission (hereinafter "the Commission") desire to amend the existing Memorandum Agreement (the Agreement) signed by all parties in 1976 to reflect current and future conditions and demands along the Interstate 90 (I-90) corridor between Bellevue and Seattle crossing Lake Washington via Mercer Island (the "I-90 Corridor"), including increased travel growth, changes in travel patterns, and a reduction in transit reliability; and

 WHEREAS, there is a desire among the parties and Sound Transit to add Sound Transit as the Regional Transit Authority with responsibility for High Capacity Transit as a signatory to this 2004 Amendment, but not to the underlying 1976 Agreement, given its role in the region generally and the I-90 Corridor specifically; and

 WHEREAS, all parties recognize the I-90 facility as a key interstate corridor connecting the East and West Coasts, Eastern and Western Washington, and recognize its importance as a critical link between major urban centers in King County, and the only means of mobility to and from Mercer Island; and

 WHEREAS, all parties acknowledge I-90 as a critical transportation link vital to the economy of the region and the state by providing for the movement of people and goods within the region; and

 WHEREAS, all parties agree that the current configuration and operation of I-90 between Bellevue, Mercer Island and Seattle does not address today's demands and expected growth in the region; and a new configuration that helps move more people and goods is imperative to manage congestion on what is the busiest east-west corridor in the region; and

 WHEREAS, all parties recognize the importance of the environment and thereby seek to preserve and enhance its quality; and

 WHEREAS, all parties agree that the ultimate configuration for I-90 between Bellevue, Mercer Island and Seattle should be defined as High Capacity Transit in the center roadway and HOV lanes in the outer roadways; and further agree that High Capacity Transit for this purpose is defined as a transit system operating in dedicated right- of-way such as light rail, monorail, or a substantially equivalent system; and

 WHEREAS, all parties agree to work cooperatively to secure funding at local, regional, state, and federal levels to fully fund both parts of the ultimate configuration of the "I-90 Corridor" (HOV lanes on the outer roadway and High Capacity Transit in the center roadway); and

 WHEREAS, all parties have studied many alternatives as participants on the Steering Committee for Sound Transit and the Washington State Department of Transportation's (WSDOT) I-90 Two-Way Transit and HOV Operations Project (Project), and all parties agree that building HOV lanes on the outer roadways as identified as Alternative R-8A as set forth in the April 25, 2003 Draft Environmental Impact Statement (DEIS) prepared for the project, is an essential first step toward achieving the ultimate configuration; and

 WHEREAS, all parties acknowledge that the ultimate configuration is consistent with the region's transportation action plan, Destination 2030, which focuses on integrated multi-modal transportation systems; describing facilities that weave parts of the region together by crossing county or city boundaries or access major regional activity centers as critical to the region's transportation system; and specifically calls for safety, maintenance and capacity investments on I-90 between I-5 and I-405; and high capacity transit in the "I-90 Corridor" between Seattle and Bellevue; and

 WHEREAS, all parties agree that I-90 is an integral piece of the regional bike network, providing the only bicycle-pedestrian path across Lake Washington; that the preferred alternative maintains a ten foot bicycle lane as part of providing optimal multi-modal travel in the I-90 corridor for cyclists and pedestrians; and

 WHEREAS, the Cities of Bellevue, Mercer Island and Seattle; King County; Sound Transit and the Washington State Transportation Commission, as participants of the I-90 Steering Committee, having conducted a thorough evaluation of the performance and benefits of the alternatives, agree that Alternative R-8A has been shown to improve regional mobility by providing reliable and safe two-way transit and high occupancy vehicle operations on I-90 between Bellevue, Mercer Island and Seattle, and mobility for Mercer Island, while minimizing impacts to the environment, to other users, and to other transportation modes; and is an essential first step toward implementing High Capacity Transit in the I-90 corridor;

 NOW THEREFORE BE IT RESOLVED, the parties to this 2004 Amendment agree to the following principles regarding future development of the I-90 Corridor between Seattle and Bellevue:

 1. Alternative R-8A with High Capacity Transit deployed in the center lanes is the ultimate configuration for I-90 in this segment;

 2. Construction of R-8A should occur as soon as possible as a first step to the ultimate configuration;

 3. Upon adoption of R-8A, move as quickly as possible to implement High Capacity Transit in the center lanes;

 4. Commit to the earliest possible conversion of center roadway to two-way High Capacity Transit operation based on outcome of studies and funding approvals.

 5. Minimize construction impacts to the existing bicycle/pedestrian path, and maintain safe access to the path during construction;

 6. Maintain the existing width of the bicycle/pedestrian path and to install screen treatments to create a safe barrier between the path users and vehicular traffic; and

 7. To the extent of any loss of mobility to and from Mercer Island based on the outcome of studies, additional transit facilities and services such as additional bus service, parking available for Mercer Island residents, and other measures shall be identified and satisfactorily addressed at the time the center roadway converts to High Capacity Transit.
