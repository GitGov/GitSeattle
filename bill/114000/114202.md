 ORDINANCE __________________

 AN ORDINANCE relating to the 1997 Families and Education Levy, making appropriations from the Educational and Developmental Services Fund for projects recommended by the Families and Education Levy Oversight Committee, by a three-fourths vote of the City Council.

 WHEREAS, the Families and Education Levy passed by voters in 1997 (the "Levy"), authorized property tax revenues for a period of seven years from 1997 to 2004 for the purpose of providing Seattle School District students, Seattle youth, and their families with educational and developmental services, as set forth in Ordinance 118557; and

 WHEREAS, the activities funded by the Levy are supplemental to the basic education financed by the State of Washington and provide programs and services such as early childhood development, school- based student and family services, student health services, out-of- school youth activities, and academic improvement activities aimed at keeping Seattle's children and youth safe, healthy and ready to learn; and

 WHEREAS, Public Health - Seattle & King County is prepared to implement planned allocations for additional Teen Health Centers and Middle School Wellness Centers; and

 WHEREAS, higher than anticipated interest revenues and property tax collections allow for additional funds to be appropriated, as recommended by the Families and Education Levy Oversight Committee, for activities that complement and enhance existing programs; and

 WHEREAS, the programming of these funds, as recommended by the Families and Education Levy Oversight Committee, is consistent with Ordinance 118557 and will provide funding for priority one-time projects that will contribute to the effectiveness of ongoing Levy programs or for new initiatives that further Levy goals;

 NOW THEREFORE,

 from the unencumbered and unexpended fund balance of the 1997 Families and Education Subfund (17855) of the Educational and Developmental Services Fund, representing proceeds and investment earnings of the levy authorized by Ordinance 118557.

 Section 2. The 2002 budget authority for the expenditures authorized in Section 1 that remains unexpended and unencumbered at the end of 2002 shall not lapse, but shall instead be carried over automatically into 2003. Any budget authority for the expenditures authorized in Section 1 that remains unexpended and unencumbered after June 30, 2003, shall be automatically abandoned.

 Section 3. The City supports efforts to promote improved health care for youth. It is the intent of the City Council and Mayor to leverage other support for student health and wellness centers and reduce their dependence on the Families and Education Levy and on the City General Fund. Toward this end, the Seattle-King County Health Department, the Seattle School District and the City of Seattle Office of Education are collaborating on a plan for a new model for delivering school-based health care. Not withstanding the financial support provided by this ordinance, the Council and Mayor reaffirm that they are not making an on-going commitment to a new plan for school-based health until a thorough review and analysis of the costs and benefits of such a plan is presented for the City Council's consideration.

 Section 4. Any act consistent with the authority and prior to the effective date of this ordinance is hereby ratified and confirmed.

 Section 5. This ordinance shall take effect and be in force thirty (30) days from and after its approval by the Mayor, but if not approved and returned by the Mayor within ten (10) days after presentation, it shall take effect as provided by Municipal Code Section 1.04.020.

 Passed by a three-fourths (3/4) vote of all the members of the City Council the _____ day of _______________, 20___, and signed by me in open session in authentication of its passage this _____ day of _______________, 20___.
