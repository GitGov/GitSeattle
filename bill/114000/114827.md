 WHEREAS, the City Council adopted Resolution 30530, which included a section stating that the Council may want to impose unique conditions on the development of the athletic fields when approving changes to the Sand Point/Magnuson Park Master Plan, separate from consideration of the Joint Athletic Fields Development Program; and

 WHEREAS, the Board of Park Commissioners held a public hearing on the development of a wetland and habitat complex, and athletic fields, at Magnuson Park and made recommendations in October 2003; and

 NOW, THEREFORE,

 BE IT ORDAINED BY THE CITY OF SEATTLE AS FOLLOWS:

 Section 1. Master Plan. The Magnuson Park Wetland / Habitat and Athletic Field Complex Master Plan (Master Plan) substantially in the form of Attachment 1 to this ordinance and as supplemented by Sections 1 through 5 of this ordinance, is hereby approved. This Master Plan supercedes Resolutions 30063 and 30293 as they pertain to the wetland / habitat and athletic field complex. Prior to commencing construction beyond that included as part of phase 1 in section 5 a below, the Department of Parks and Recreation (DPR) shall submit to the Council an overlay map showing the extent and nature of habitat types (including an inventory of plants by species) for the proposed wetland/natural area of the Park. The Council anticipates adopting the overlay map as a part of this Master Plan.

 Section 2. Multi-Purpose Activity and Sports Meadow Master Plan Element. The Council approves the Multi-Purpose Activity and Sports Meadow element of the Master Plan in the location shown on Attachment 1 with the condition that the Multi-Purpose Activity and Sports Meadow has a grass surface and no field lighting or permanent sportsfield structures, including but not limited to bleachers, base path cutouts, backstops, and goal cages.

 Section 3. Sportsfields Outside the Multi-Purpose Activity and Sports Meadow Master Plan Element. The Council conditionally approves a maximum of 7 lit fields and a maximum of 2 unlit fields, or a total of no more than 9 fields, outside the Multi-Purpose Activity and Sports Meadow as shown in Attachment 1. As many of the lit fields may be equipped with all-weather, synthetic playing surfaces as is financially feasible, at the discretion of DPR. In order to mitigate the impacts of field lighting, approval is conditioned as follows: 1) on Monday through Saturday, the field lights shall be turned off no later than 10 PM on all fields; and 2) no field lighting shall be used on Sundays. Further conditions may be imposed on the Council's final land use approval of field lighting pole heights at Sand Pont/Magnuson Park following consideration by the Council's Urban Development and Planning Committee.

 Section 4. Wetland/natural Area Master Plan Element.

 a. The Council approves a wetland/natural area element of the Master Plan as shown on Attachment 1.

 b. Prior to commencing construction beyond that included as part of phase 1 in Section 5 a. below, DPR shall submit to the Council for review and possible adoption as a part of this Master Plan, a Wetland/natural area Monitoring and Adaptive Management Plan. For each created wetland and natural area, the monitoring and reporting shall cover a period of three years from the completion of planting. The Plan shall provide for monitoring and reporting progress at key stages of creating new wetlands and natural areas, including designing and plant selection, grading, soil deconsolidation and amendment, planting, and mulching, irrigating and weeding new plantings until established. The Plan shall include an adaptive management strategy to remedy any problems that might compromise the functioning of the new wetlands and natural areas.

 Section 5. Phasing and Use of Improvements. It is the Council's intent that user fees and facility and field scheduling policies and practices at the Magnuson Park wetland / habitat and athletic field complex be consistent with Citywide policies and practices.

 a. Phase 1: The rehabilitation of the Multi-Purpose Activity and Sports Meadow, or that portion of it that can proceed without an Army Corps of Engineers wetland permit, shall begin and be completed as soon as possible. Also, as part of phase 1, DPR shall undertake, to the extent feasible, to improve upland habitat in the area to the south and east of the Multi-Purpose Activity and Sports Meadow.

 b. Phase 2: Prior to commencing construction of phase 2 improvements, but no later than March 2006, DPR shall report back to the Council regarding what additional parts of the Master Plan it proposes to accomplish as phase 2. The report shall clearly specify the extent of removal of the Commissary and surrounding parking lots to be accomplished; the extent of wetland and natural area work; and which sports fields are to be constructed; and give a complete description of the amounts, sources and any conditions attached to funding sources to be used in phase 2. DPR shall have identified adequate funds to fully implement the proposed phase 2 improvements at the time of the report to the Council. It is the Council's intent that any external funding for phase 2 Magnuson Park wetland / habitat and athletic field complex improvements not constrain the City's ability to determine the scope, nature, sequencing or timing of 1) any improvements other than those funded by the external source and any required matching funds or 2) operation and maintenance expenditures at Sand Point/Magnuson Park.

 c. Phase 3 and later phases. Before commencing construction on any improvements beyond those comprising phases 1 and 2 above, DPR shall satisfy the following condition: DPR shall submit to the Council for its consideration and approval a funding plan showing both the capital cost and the on-going operations and maintenance cost for all improvements proposed as part of that phase and proposing specific sources of funding adequate to fully cover costs. The funding plan shall also include provision for remedying any problems with sportsfields, wetlands and natural areas, or other facilities built in prior phases. Identification of any problems in the wetlands or natural areas will be based on the wetland/natural area monitoring and adaptive management reports covering a period of three years as called for in Section 4 b. . It is the Council's intent that any City funding appropriated or proposed to be appropriated leverage significant external funding. It is also the Council's intent that any external funding for phase 3 or later Magnuson Park wetland / habitat and athletic field complex improvements not constrain the City's ability to determine the scope, nature, sequencing or timing of 1) any improvements other than those funded by the external source and any required matching funds or 2) operation and maintenance expenditures at Sand Point/Magnuson Park.

 Section 6. Annual Sportsfield Report to the Council. DPR shall submit an annual sportsfield report to the Council concurrent with the Executive's proposed budget beginning in 2004, providing the information similar to that requested in Council Resolution 30530 adopted in 2002, to inform future Council decisions on City sportsfields. The report should include:

 a. A spreadsheet showing for each field scheduled by DPR (i.e., City fields and School District fields), the number of hours scheduled the previous calendar year a) by sport and whether youth or adult play and b) whether unlit or lit play. The table should note any special circumstances that limited the scheduling of a field in the current year (see Exhibit 1).

 b. A table showing for each field, the condition of the field, a description of any improvements completed or to be completed in the current year along with the expected expansion of field capacity to be provided by any improvements (expressed in annual field hours) and a description of any improvements proposed for the following biennium, their cost and the expected increase in capacity (see Exhibit 1).

 Section 7. The restrictions imposed by the following budget proviso which limit spending on the following projects are lifted because the conditions set forth in the proviso have been satisfied:

 Department Green Sheet Proviso Description Project 2004 # ID(s) Amount ($)
