 ORDINANCE __________

 AN ORDINANCE relating to funding childcare and early learning through additional regular property taxes; providing for the submission to the qualified voters of the City at a special election to be held on November 5, 2002 of a proposed measure, as a substitute for proposed Initiative 77, authorizing the City to levy regular property taxes for up to 2 years in excess of the limitation on levies in Chapter 84.55 RCW for the purpose of providing up to $3,000,000 of funding for certain childcare and early childhood education services.

 WHEREAS, the petition signatures that caused Initiative No. 77 to qualify for introduction and consideration by the City Council were submitted to the City Clerk on August 7, 2002; and

 WHEREAS, the City Clerk forwarded the petition signatures to King County Records and Elections for validation and determination of sufficiency; and

 WHEREAS, King County Records and Elections found the petition to contain sufficient valid signatures and issued a Certificate of Sufficiency to the City Clerk on August 12, 2002; and

 WHEREAS, pursuant to the City Charter, Article IV, Section 1. B, the City Clerk presented the City Clerk's Report and Certificate of Sufficiency to the City Council at its regular meeting on August 12, 2002 in Clerk File 305171; and

 WHEREAS, the City Council accepted the introduction of the Clerk File and referred it to the Full Council for deliberation; and

 WHEREAS, the City now provides approximately One and a Half Million Dollars ($1,500,000) on an annual basis for childcare and early childhood education services from its voter-approved Families and Education Levy which will be considered for renewal by the voters in 2004 and may be the most appropriate vehicle for providing long-term additional funding for childcare and early childhood education services. The planning process for this Levy will begin in 2003 and would provide the forum for public discussion and review of existing services provided, unmet demand for services, and decisions regarding most appropriate programs to fund given desired outcomes; and

 WHEREAS, a voter-approved levy "lid lift" for regular property taxes could provide adequate additional revenues for childcare and early childhood education services for the short term, until renewal of the Families and Education Levy can be considered.

 WHEREAS, for the above stated reasons, the City Council has rejected Initiative No. 77 and has ordered that it be submitted to the voters of the City at an election to be held on November 5, 2002, together with any different measure dealing with the same subject enacted by the Council; and

 WHEREAS, the City Council, will honor the citizen process and allow the people to determine at the next November election whether this substitute measure or Initiative No. 77 should become law;

 NOW THEREFORE,

 BE IT ORDAINED BY THE CITY OF SEATTLE AS FOLLOWS:

 Section 1. Levy of Additional Regular Property Taxes - Submittal. As a substitute for and an alternative to proposed Initiative 77, the City hereby submits to the qualified electors of the City a proposition as authorized by RCW 84.55.050 to exceed the levy limitation on regular property taxes contained in RCW 84.55.010 for property taxes levied in 2002 through 2003 for collection in 2003 through 2004, respectively, for the sole purpose of raising Three Million Dollars ($3,000,000) in aggregate over a period of up to two (2) years, to provide childcare and early childhood education services. Pursuant to RCW 84.55.050(4), the maximum regular property taxes that may be levied in 2004 for collection in 2005 and in later years shall be computed as if property taxes had not been increased under this ordinance.

 Section 2. Application of Proceeds. The proceeds of the additional taxes authorized under this Ordinance (the "Proceeds") shall be deposited in the City Treasury into a special 2003 Childcare and Early Learning Subfund (the "Subfund") within the Human Services Operating Fund. Moneys in the Subfund may be temporarily deposited or invested in such manner as may be lawful for the investment of City money and interest and other earnings shall be deposited in the Subfund. The principal Proceeds and any interest or other earnings from their deposit or investment shall be applied solely for childcare and early learning programs serving low-income families and individuals, which may include, but are not limited to the following:

 1. Pre-kindergarten programs and related services for 3 to 5 year olds;

 2. grant programs to subsidize the cost of early learning and childcare;

 3. career and wage ladder program contracts for center-based providers;

 4. professional education program contracts with family childcare home providers;

 5. administrative costs for operating such programs.

 Section 3. All programs funded by Proceeds shall be targeted to programs or services serving low-income families and individuals. For the purposes of this Ordinance, "low income families and individuals" means families and individuals from households with income less than or equal to fifty percent (50%) of median family income, as published from time to time by the United States Department of Housing and Urban Development (or its successor agency).

 Section 4. Funding Recommendations. Recommendations regarding proposed programs to be funded, funding amounts, achievement levels, and evaluation methods for programs shall be developed by the Oversight Committee established in Section 5 of this Ordinance, and forwarded to the Council for final review and approval. The Council may modify any proposal submitted by the Oversight Committee.

 Section 5. Oversight Committee. An Oversight Committee is hereby established to review the expenditure of Levy Funds, to advise upon expenditures and allocations for the following year, and to make recommendations on the implementation of particular programs and on any reallocations. The Oversight Committee shall consist of fourteen (14) members. Seven (7) members shall be appointed by the Mayor, and seven (7) members shall be appointed by the Council. Appointments shall be made on an alternating basis, with the first appointment being made by the Council. The members of the Oversight Committee shall include one Councilmember or his or her designee and the Director of the Human Services Department or his or her designee. The remaining twelve (12) members shall include: at least one parent or legal guardian who is a consumer of early learning and/or childcare services for his or her child or ward; a representative of Seattle Public Schools (to be nominated by the Superintendent); at least one person who is a director of a center-based childcare provider; at least one person who is a licensed in-home daycare service provider; at least one person who is a teacher or care giver employed by a center-based child care provider; at least one person who is an administrator of a Head Start or Early Childhood Education Assistance Program (ECEAP) or similar program; at least one person who is an owner and/or operator of a business enterprise within the City employing ten (10) or more employees; and at least one person who is a policy/program expert in early childhood development and education. The members of the Oversight Committee shall serve for a period of two (2) years, commencing at the respective dates of their appointments, subject to reappointment. All members other than the Director of the Department of Human Services (or his or her designee) must be City residents. Appointed members shall be discharged from further service by two (2) consecutive unexcused absences of Oversight Committee meetings, by moving their residence from Seattle, and for other cause. Members shall serve without pay, but may be reimbursed their expenses, including payments for childcare while attending meetings. The Oversight Committee may adopt rules for its own procedures, including the frequency of meetings, and rules for avoiding any potential conflicts of interest (or the appearance thereof) on the part of Committee members.

 Section 6. This ordinance is a different measure dealing with the same subject and conflicting with Initiative Measure No. 77, as those terms are used in City Charter Article IV, Sections 1.D and 1.G. This ordinance should therefore be submitted to the qualified electors of the City of Seattle for their consideration on the same ballot with Initiative Measure No. 77. This ordinance is hereby referred to a vote of the qualified electors of the City at the special city election being held in conjunction with the general election to be held on November 5, 2002.

 Section 7. Ballot Measure. The King County Director of Records and Elections, as ex officio supervisor of elections, is hereby requested, in conjunction with the state general election on November 5, 2002, to submit this alternative ballot measure to the qualified electors of the City. The City Clerk is hereby authorized to take those actions necessary to submit, pursuant to City Charter Article IV, Section 1.D, this alternative ballot measure to the qualified electors of the City of Seattle for their approval or rejection at the special municipal election to be held in conjunction with the November 5, 2002 state general election. The Executive Director of the Ethics and Elections Commission is authorized to take the steps necessary to produce a voters' pamphlet for the election, including for this alternative measure.

 Section 8. Ballot Title and Explanatory Statement. The City Attorney shall prepare the ballot title and explanatory statement for this alternative measure as provided by applicable law.

 Section 9. Severability. In the event any one or more of the provisions of this ordinance shall for any reason be held to be invalid, such invalidity shall not affect any other provision of this ordinance or the levy of the additional taxes authorized herein, but this ordinance and the levy of those taxes shall be construed and enforced as if such invalid provisions had not been contained herein; and any provision which shall for any reason be held by reason of its extent to be invalid shall be deemed to be in effect to the extent permitted by law.

 Section 10. Ratification. Certification of such proposition by the City Clerk to the King County Director of Records and Elections in accordance with law prior to the date of such election on November 5, 2002, and any other act consistent with the authority and prior to the effective date of this ordinance, are hereby ratified and confirmed.

 Section 11. Effective Dates. Sections 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5 of this ordinance shall go into effect only if this substitute measure is approved by the qualified electors of the City of Seattle, and if Initiative Measure No. 77 and this substitute measure should both be approved, Sections 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5 of this ordinance shall go into effect only if this alternative measure receives a greater number of affirmative votes than does Initiative Measure No. 77. If this measure goes into effect as set forth in this section, its effective date shall be from and after proclamation by the Mayor, which shall be made within five (5) days after the election.

 Section 12. Except as provided in Section 8, this ordinance shall take effect and be in force immediately upon the ordinance's approval by the Mayor or, if is not approved and returned by the Mayor within ten (10) days after presentation, then on the eleventh (11th) day after its presentation to the Mayor or, if vetoed by the Mayor, then immediately after its passage over his veto.
