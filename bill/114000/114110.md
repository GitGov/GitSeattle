 This Memorandum of Understanding is supplemental to the Collective Bargaining Agreement by and between the City of Seattle, hereinafter referred to as the City, and the International Federation of Professional and Technical Engineers, Local 17 (Professional, Technical, Senior Business, Senior Professional, Administrative Support Units), hereinafter referred to as the Union.

 It is understood and agreed by and between the City and the Union that:

 1. Based on the showing of interest submitted by the Union, the City voluntarily recognized the Union as the exclusive collective bargaining representative for employees whose job classifications are Counselor and Registered Nurse Consultant, in the Human Services Department and Parks and Recreation Department and such job classifications shall become part of the Union's existing Professional Unit and be covered by the I.F.P.T.E., Local 17(Professional, Technical, Senior Business, Senior Professional, Administrative Support Units) Collective Bargaining Agreement. Because of the laps of time between when the Union was recognized as the exclusive representative and reaching an agreement, these employees did not receive the 2002 annual salary adjustment referenced in Section 9.2 of the collective bargaining agreement; therefore, the employees in positions titled Counselor will receive the 3.5% adjustment, effective January 2, 2002.

 2. The City and the Union agree to the following hourly rates of pay for the title of Registered Nurse Consultant, effective March 1, 2002:

 $21.84

 $22.72

 $23.60

 $24.55

 3. Employees allocated to the classification of Registered Nurse Consultant, effective March 1, 2002, shall be placed one step higher than what's provided for by the promotion rule within the current Collective Bargaining Agreement (Article 9.9G), not to exceed the top step wage rate of $24.55.

 4. The two (2) least senior Counselors (Registered Nurses), who will not be reclassified to the title Registered Nurse Consultant, will receive a one (1) time only cash payment of $1,000 per person.

 5. Section 19.10 of the collective bargaining agreement will be revised as follows:

 19.10 A. Employees working in positions identified as Community Service Representative and Community Service Center Coordinator shall make necessary adjustments when approved by the City in their normal daily work hours required to fulfill their normal job responsibilities within an average forty (40) hour work week. If no adjustments of work hours are necessary, the employee's normal workday shall be eight (8) consecutive hours of work excluding the period designated as meal time; provided, however, employees shall not be expected by the City to work in excess of an average of forty (40) hours per week without overtime compensation.

 B. Employees working in positions identified as Counselor and Registered Nurse Consultant shall, with notification to the supervisor and advance approval when foreseeable, make the necessary adjustments in their daily work hours required to fulfill their job responsibilities within a forty (40) hour work week. If no adjustments of work hours are necessary, the employee's normal work day shall be eight (8) consecutive hours of work, excluding the period designated as meal time; provided, however, employees shall not be expected by the City to work in excess of forty (40) hours per week without overtime compensation or mutually agreed upon comp time. If a flex adjustment is unforeseeable, the employee will notify the supervisor the following work day.

 6. Section 22.2 of the collective bargaining agreement will be revised as follows in bill draft form:

 22.2 An employee covered by this Agreement, who obtains a Washington State Professional Engineer's, Architect's, Landscape Architect's, or Land Surveyor's license on or after consummation of this Agreement, shall have the original cost of the license paid by the City, and an employee covered by this Agreement who currently holds such a license, regardless of when obtained, shall have the annual renewal fee for said license paid by the City; provided, however, that the employee must be working in a classification relevant to the license obtained and/or held by said employee. An employee covered by this Agreement shall also receive their regular straight-time salary while taking the examination applicable to the above licenses during a normal workday.

 An employee in the Human Services Department, who is required to be a Licensed Registered Nurse, shall have the annual renewal fee for said license paid by the City.
