 AN ORDINANCE increasing the appropriation in the 2003 budget of the Finance Department by decreasing the appropriation in the Reserve for Community Health Center Partners in the 2003 Finance General budget.

 WHEREAS in the 2003 budget the City Council appropriated $2,541,504 for the Department of Finance General as a reserve for Community Health Center Partners; and

 WHEREAS in making that appropriation the City Council stated its intent to determine the appropriate City role in providing direct health care services for the poor, beginning with a review of the performance of and funding sources for similar services provided by community health centers and the Seattle & King County Department of Public Health, to be completed in March 2003 or as soon as possible thereafter; and

 WHEREAS the City Council charged the Finance Department and Office of Policy & Management with conducting this review and stated that a portion of the funds in the Finance General Reserve for Community Health Center Partners may be applied to the review; and

 WHEREAS through the Educational & Developmental Services Levy the City also funds school-based health centers; and

 WHEREAS the school-based health centers are projected to consume an increasing share of the Educational & Developmental Services Levy, and this warrants a review of the functions of school-based health centers in the context of both the overall goals of the Levy and the public health system; and

 WHEREAS, in connection with the review of community health centers, the Office of Policy & Management proposes to collect information on the clients, services and service outcomes of school-based health centers; and

 WHEREAS the Finance Department and Office of Policy & Management have proposed to contract with a consultant who has expertise in public health funding to assist in the review of community health centers; and

 WHEREAS by this ordinance the City Council intends to provide timely and adequate funding in the Finance Department for such a consultant contract, but also intends that the Finance Department and Office of Policy & Management provide staff assistance to the review in order to minimize the cost of the consultant contract and preserve as much funding as possible for public health services; and
