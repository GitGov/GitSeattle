 AN ORDINANCE relating to the terms of members of the Human Rights Commission and amending SMC 3.14.920.

 WHEREAS, the Seattle Human Rights Commission, Seattle Women's Commission and the Seattle Commission for Sexual Minorities all have commission members who serve two year terms; and

 WHEREAS, new commissioners must occasionally be appointed to fill an unexpired term; and

 WHEREAS, the current language governing appointments to fill unexpired terms is confusing and treats Seattle Human Rights commissioners differently from commissioners serving on the Seattle Women's Commission and the Seattle Sexual Minorities Commission; and

 WHEREAS, the Office for Civil Rights would like the terms for all three commissions to be uniform and predictable; and

 NOW THEREFORE,

 BE IT ORDAINED BY THE CITY OF SEATTLE AS FOLLOWS:

Upon the expiration of existing terms, new appointments to each position on each commission shall be made under this section by the authority originally appointing persons to that position, as follows:

 ***

 D. All appointments shall be subject to confirmation by a majority vote of the City Council. Each member appointed pursuant to the authority of this section shall serve for a term of two (2) years, but no member of the Seattle Human Rights Commission or the Seattle Women's Commission shall serve more than two (2) consecutive two (2) year terms. ~~If a member is appointed to serve an unexpired term of a previous Seattle Human Rights Commission member, that term shall qualify as one (1) of two (2) consecutive terms. Otherwise, if~~ If a member is appointed to serve an unexpired term of a previous commission member, that term shall qualify as one (1) of two (2) consecutive terms only if the length of the unexpired term actually served is one (1) year or more. Any vacancy shall be filled for the unexpired term in the same manner as an original appointment.

 Section 2. This ordinance shall take effect and be in force thirty (30) days from and after its approval by the Mayor, but if not approved and returned by the Mayor within ten (10) days after presentation, it shall take effect as provided by Municipal Code Section 1.04.020.
