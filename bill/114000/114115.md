 AN ORDINANCE authorizing the Mayor to enter into an agreement with the Central Puget Sound Regional Transit Authority to establish, oversee, and fund Seattle's portion of the Transit-Oriented Community Development Fund for Southeast Seattle, and to provide funding support for certain aspects of the Central Link light-rail project.

 WHEREAS, the Board of Directors of the Central Puget Sound Regional Transit Authority ("Sound Transit") established the Transit-Oriented Community Development Fund (the "Fund") to increase transit ridership on Central Link light rail ("Link light rail") and to address the impacts of Link light rail construction and operation when it adopted Resolution 99-34 on November 18, 1999; and

 WHEREAS, Sound Transit Resolution 99-34, adopted November 18, 1999, stated "The cost of [the Fund] shall, to the extent possible, be offset by contributions from Seattle and King County to the Central Link light rail project"; and

 WHEREAS, Seattle and King County led efforts to gain Sound Transit approval of a $50 million Transit-Oriented Community Development Fund and Seattle and King County will finance the Fund's expenditures to a large extent through this Agreement, and through a separate agreement between Sound Transit and King County for the County's contribution of $7.2 million to the Fund; and

 WHEREAS, the Federal Transit Administration ("FTA") required that Sound Transit establish the Transit-Oriented Community Development Fund as a mitigation condition of the FTA's January 2000 Record of Decision on the Central Link light rail Environmental Impact Statement (the "ROD"); and

 WHEREAS, entry into this Agreement is intended to satisfy the ROD mitigation condition and the cooperation between the parties herein will ensure that the Fund is more flexible than it otherwise would be if funded and administered solely by one of the parties; and

 WHEREAS, the Southeast Seattle community has expressed a desire for significant financial contribution and involvement by Seattle in part because such involvement enhances the flexibility of the Fund and may allow the Fund to become a "revolving fund"; and

 WHEREAS, by adoption of Motion 2000-72 on August 10, 2000, Sound Transit's Board of Directors established a steering committee made up of ten (10) volunteer community members and five (5) Seattle, Sound Transit, and King County representatives (the "Steering Committee") to propose a detailed operating plan for the Fund; and

 WHEREAS, the Steering Committee has held numerous public meetings to develop a proposed operating plan for the Fund and is on schedule to complete it by April 2002 for consideration by the Sound Transit Board and the Seattle City Council; and

 WHEREAS, by adoption of Resolution 2001-16 on November 29, 2001, Sound Transit's Board of Directors adopted an initial segment that includes construction of light rail in Southeast Seattle; and

 WHEREAS, Sound Transit's Board of Directors directed in Resolution 99-34 that Fund expenditures shall be generally consistent with the timing of construction of Link light rail in Southeast Seattle, the mitigation of impacts of the project, and promotion of increased ridership. Sound Transit expects to begin its property acquisition process in 2002, with the initial impacts to be mitigated occurring soon thereafter in Southeast Seattle; and

 WHEREAS, Seattle considers the Central Link light rail project a critical element of the regional transportation system, and as such, recognizes the importance of multi-jurisdictional funding support for Link light rail; and

 WHEREAS, Seattle, in Resolution 30073, adopted on November 15, 1999 stated that it is willing to contribute assistance and revenues for the construction of Link light rail; and

 WHEREAS, in July, 2000, the parties executed the Agreement Between the City of Seattle and Sound Transit for Grant of Non-Exclusive Use of a Light Rail Transit Way as Related to the Central Link Light Rail Transit Project setting forth terms and conditions for Sound Transit's use of Seattle right-of-way and payment of utility relocation costs incurred as a result of Link light rail construction and implementation; and

 WHEREAS, Seattle finds it appropriate that Seattle's utilities invest in certain infrastructure alterations to accommodate the Central Link light rail development in Southeast Seattle; and

 WHEREAS, the Fund will be established to preserve and strengthen cultural and economic diversity, long-term livability, and economic opportunity for Southeast Seattle residents, businesses, and institutions and will help mitigate the substantial impacts of constructing Link light rail in Southeast Seattle; NOW THEREFORE,

 BE IT ORDAINED BY THE CITY OF SEATTLE AS FOLLOWS:

 Section 1. The Mayor is hereby authorized to enter into an agreement with Sound Transit substantially in the form of the agreement attached to this ordinance (Exhibit A), entitled "Agreement Executed by Central Puget Sound Regional Transit Authority and the City of Seattle to Establish, Oversee, and Fund the City Of Seattle's Portion of the Transit-Oriented Community Development Fund and to Provide Funding Support for Certain Aspects of the Central Link Light-Rail Project." The Agreement commits Sound Transit to create a Community Development Fund that will provide Southeast Seattle with substantial mitigation and community development support to ameliorate the effects of the Central Link light rail development in that community. In turn, Seattle pledges to provide $21.3 million in direct support to the Community Development Account of the Community Development Fund and $21.5 million in utility support for Sound Transit's contributions to the Supplemental Mitigation Account of the Fund.

 Section 2. The City Council recognizes that Sound Transit's Central Link light rail project is unique, and presents unique circumstances warranting the creation of the Community Development Fund. Sound Transit is investing about $1.5 billion in capital costs for Central Link within the City of Seattle. This will result in a new at-grade light rail line through Southeast Seattle, but this benefit will also have negative impacts on the residents, businesses, and institutions of Southeast Seattle. There will be approximately 64 full property acquisitions and approximately 232 partial property acquisitions along the light rail line between Beacon Hill and Boeing Access Road, and the acquisition of these properties is expected to result in the relocation of approximately 60 businesses and 38 residential households. Many other businesses and residents, although not displaced by light rail, will be negatively impacted by the light rail construction activities. The Southeast Seattle neighborhoods affected by light rail constitute an historically-disadvantaged community and have high numbers of minority, immigrant, and low- income residents. In this community, market forces alone may not result in the kinds of economic and community re-development that is needed to make the light rail system a success. The convergence of all these characteristics - a huge investment in a regional transportation improvement, displacement of small businesses, high presence of low-income minorities, refugees, and immigrants, and weak market conditions to drive redevelopment - creates a unique situation that merits a City investment in the neighborhood beyond what would otherwise be necessary.

 The Federal Transit Administration (FTA) stated, in the Record of Decision dated January 2000, as follows:

 The Final EIS recognizes that the light rail project may have adverse impacts on certain businesses located with the Rainier Valley . . . . Sound Transit shall, therefore, implement a [Community Development Fund] program funded at a level of $50 Million . . . . This [Fund] shall be used and available to assist the community and the qualified local businesses, neighborhood organizations and community institutions within this area to mitigate and offset adverse economic impacts that they may suffer due to the Link light rail and its construction.

 While authorizing execution of the attached Agreement, the City Council states its intent that due to the unique circumstances surrounding Link light rail construction in Southeast Seattle, execution of this Agreement and creation of the Community Development Fund shall not establish a precedent for future capital projects or for other neighborhoods. This includes, but is not limited to, the following:

 (a) Creation of this Fund shall not establish a precedent for the creation of similar funds for other large (or smaller) infrastructure projects that have significant impacts on a particular community or communities.

 (b) Contributions of cash and/or in-kind services from City utilities to Sound Transit to offset Sound Transit's contributions to the Supplemental Mitigation Account of the Fund shall not establish a precedent for City utilities to bear financial responsibility for utility work related to other infrastructure projects.

 (c) Payments from the City's General Fund into the Community Development Account of the Fund shall not establish a precedent for the General Fund similarly to pay for community development activities in communities affected by other infrastructure projects.

 Section 3. Sound Transit Board Resolution R99-34 provides that Sound Transit shall establish the Community Development Fund with the cost to be offset, to the extent possible, by Seattle and King County. This Resolution also addresses specific uses of the funds and how to make decisions regarding these uses as follows: "The Fund shall be available to the community to fund physical and economic improvements to the Southeast Seattle corridor. The Fund shall be used exclusively to increase transit ridership on the system and/or to address project impacts. Sound Transit will work with the City of Seattle and the southeast Seattle community to develop a process to decide how decisions regarding the use of The Fund will be made. A community advisory panel or panels shall be established to set priorities and make recommendations for the use of The Fund." Given the focus on increasing transit ridership and the emphasis on empowering community members to establish priorities for the Fund, the Operating Plan to be submitted to the City Council and the Sound Transit Board under Section 3 of the Agreement must explain in detail how each proposed payment or advance product will satisfy the requirement that the Fund be used exclusively to increase transit ridership or address project impacts. In particular, for the Community Development Account portion of the Fund, the Operating Plan must make clear how each proposed community development product will serve to increase transit ridership, and must specify the criteria that the governing entity of the Fund will use to evaluate applications for funding from the Community Development Account and to make decisions on funding.

 In recognition of the need to assist impacted businesses as soon as possible, the City Council recognizes that the initial Operating Plan will provide descriptions of products and services available for supplemental mitigation and the development of receiving or relocation sites for dislocated businesses in sufficient detail to meet the conditions precedent for the release of public funds contained in Section 4.1 of the Agreement. The City Council further recognizes that future amendments to the Operating Plan will be necessary before the Fund can expend any City of Seattle funds on the transit-oriented and community development activities of the Fund. These future amendments shall describe the products and services developed to implement the transit-oriented and community development activities of the Fund in sufficient detail to meet the requirements of this Section 3.

 The highest priority for use of City of Seattle payments to the Community Development Account shall be for projects within 1/4 mile of the Link light rail alignment in Southeast Seattle and for projects that support connections to, and transit-oriented development within, commercial and residential centers that are intended to be closely connected to the Link light rail line. Examples would include projects within existing commercial centers within the geographic boundaries of the Community Development Fund, such as South Edmunds Street and the Columbia City business district, South Othello Street and NewHolly, and South Henderson Street and the Rainier Beach urban village. In addition to the Operating Plan presented to the City Council by the Steering Committee of the Community Development Fund, the Office of Economic Development will include, in the proposed City legislation to approve the Operating Plan, a description of: (1) how the City will oversee the Community  Development Fund to ensure it is complying with the expressed purposes of the Operating Plan, and (2) the recourse available to the City if the governing entity of the Community Development Fund fails to comply with these purposes.

 Section 4. The City Council recently adopted Resolution 30459, agreeing to provide funding toward undergrounding utilities in Southeast Seattle as part of the light rail construction project, and the City Council, by passing this ordinance, is agreeing to provide utility support to the light rail project and to make direct payments into the Community Development Fund. Given these agreements and the significant City financial contribution to the light rail project that they represent, the City shall not agree to pay for any additional costs of projects or improvements related to the Central Link light rail project that would otherwise be Sound Transit's responsibility, beyond those already agreed to.

 Section 5. Any acts taken in furtherance of the purpose of this ordinance, but prior to its effective date, are hereby ratified and confirmed.

 Section 6. This ordinance shall take effect and be in force thirty (30) days from and after its approval by the Mayor, but if not approved and returned by the Mayor within ten (10) days after presentation, it shall take effect as provided by Municipal Code Section 1.04.020.

 AGREEMENT

 1. Recitals. The recitals set forth above are incorporated in this Agreement.

 2. Establishment of Fund. The parties agree to establish, oversee, and fund Seattle's portion of the Transit-Oriented Community Development Fund as set forth in this Agreement. The purposes of the Fund shall be to increase transit ridership within the geographic boundaries of the Fund and to address the impacts of Link light rail construction and operation. The Fund shall be comprised of the two separate accounts (the "Accounts") described below, and shall be administered as provided in this Agreement.

 2.1 Supplemental Mitigation Account. Sound Transit shall fund and oversee the "Supplemental Mitigation Account" for the purpose of providing mitigation of the impacts of Link light rail construction and operation within the geographic boundaries of the Fund. This mitigation is in addition to mitigation Sound Transit provides to impacted businesses and individuals as part of its agency mitigation program. The funding level established for the Supplemental Mitigation Account is based on the Steering Committee's assessment of the community's supplemental needs for mitigation of project impacts.

 2.2 Community Development Account. Seattle shall fund and oversee the "Community Development Account," for the purpose of funding real- estate development and community improvement projects that benefit the residents, businesses, and institutions of Southeast Seattle and increase transit ridership within the geographic boundaries of the Fund.

 3. Operating Plan. The Steering Committee is expected to present its proposed operating plan for administration of the Fund to the Sound Transit Board and Seattle City Council for consideration by April 2002. By Motion 2000-72, Sound Transit's Board directed the Steering Committee to include in its proposed operating plan the following elements:

 "Staffing needs, financial plan, analysis of the market and needs for Fund services, products and services to be delivered by the Fund, policies and procedures, priorities and guidelines for expending funds, the geographic boundaries of the Fund, a timeline including milestones and public meetings to ensure accountability, a form of governance which is consistent with the Sound Transit Board's fiduciary responsibility while also preserving a community-based governing body's authority to make independent decisions about specific uses of the funds."

 3.1 Adoption of the Operating Plan. Sound Transit's Board and the Seattle City Council shall receive and evaluate the Steering Committee's proposed operating plan. The operating plan shall become effective upon adoption, by the Sound Transit Board and the Seattle City Council, of an identical (to each other) final operating plan (the "Operating Plan") that incorporates, at a minimum, the elements listed above and also specifically provides for the following:

 3.1.1 Establishment. A process by which the entity designated to administer the Fund will be established and/or staffed in a timely manner so as to achieve its intended purposes, including mitigation of project impacts.

 3.1.2 Governance. A Fund administrator that has a governance structure sufficient to ensure that decisions regarding the Fund and its expenditures are made openly and are based upon objective written criteria and in a way that avoids conflict of interest or the appearance of such conflict; and that funds are distributed for lawful purposes and in a lawful manner consistent with this Agreement.

 3.2 Approval Date. The date upon which the latter of the Seattle City Council or the Sound Transit Board adopts the Operating Plan shall be deemed the "approval" date of the Operating Plan.

 3.3 Additional Commitments. Following adoption of the Operating Plan and establishment of an entity to administer the Fund, Seattle shall cooperate with Sound Transit's efforts, if any, to seek assurances from the FTA that Sound Transit's performance under this Agreement satisfies the Record of Decision condition as it relates to the Community Development Account of the Fund.

 4. Funding. Following approval of the Operating Plan the parties shall fund the Fund as set forth in this Section 4.

 4.1 Conditions Precedent to Funding Obligations. Except as provided in Section 4.3.1, neither party shall be obliged to make an initial payment to the Fund (nor, in Seattle's case, make a supporting contribution to Link light rail) until the conditions precedent expressed below to be for that party's benefit have been satisfied or waived in that party's sole discretion. For Seattle, any waiver must be by way of a City Council resolution with the Mayor concurring, or by a resolution adopted by a two-thirds vote of the City Council. This Agreement shall terminate upon written notice by one party to the other that the notifying party has reasonably determined that a condition precedent for that party's benefit is impossible to achieve, despite that party's reasonable efforts to promote its achievement, and further, the notifying party does not consent to waive such condition precedent.

 4.1.1 Sound Transit Entry Into Full Funding Grant Agreement. Sound Transit has executed a Full Funding Grant Agreement with the FTA ("FFGA") in the amount of $500 million or in an amount that Sound Transit finds sufficient to implement Link light rail on substantially the same schedule and scope as is reflected in Resolution 2001-16, approved by the Sound Transit Board on November 29, 2001. In the event the FFGA is for an amount less than $500 million, Sound Transit shall present Seattle with a revised financial plan for implementation of Link light rail. This condition precedent shall be deemed satisfied unless within sixty (60) days after the presentation of Sound Transit's financial plan, Seattle declines, by way of a City Council Resolution with the Mayor concurring, or by a resolution adopted by a two-thirds vote of the City Council, to accept Sound Transit's revised financial plan. This condition precedent is for the benefit of both Seattle and Sound Transit.

 4.1.2 Establishment of an Entity to Administer the Fund. The entity designated to administer the Fund has been established and staffed pursuant to the Operating Plan such that it has the capacity to accept funds and administer them. Further, both Seattle and Sound Transit have entered into a contract or contracts with such entity to provide for administration of the Fund and oversight of the Accounts. These conditions precedent are for the benefit of both Seattle and Sound Transit.

 4.2 Seattle Funding. Seattle shall provide funding support in the amount of $42.8 million subject to lesser payments under Section 4.2.2.3. This funding support shall be in two forms: (1) supporting contributions to Link light rail, and (2) direct contributions to the Community Development Account. The amounts and conditions of this funding support are set forth below.

 4.2.1 Supporting Contributions to Link Light Rail. Seattle shall provide Sound Transit with utility support totaling $21.5 million, to be used by Sound Transit for expenses directly related to utility- related elements of Link light rail (excluding betterments as detailed in the Utility Plan pursuant to Section 6). These utility- related elements may include the design, procurement, utility construction and utility relocations related to utilities owned by Seattle and required for construction of the light rail transportation project. All or part of this amount shall be offset by the value of any such utility work done by Seattle under this Agreement and according to the Utility Plan. The payments and offsets shall be made as follows:

 4.2.1.1 Sound Transit-Performed Work. Sound Transit and/or its contractors shall perform utility-related work that would otherwise be the obligation of and/or for the benefit of Seattle Public Utilities and Seattle City Light under this Section 4.2.1 and the Utility Plan, and Seattle shall reimburse Sound Transit for such work performed on or after January 1, 2001, until Sound Transit has received a total of $21.5 million in payments and offsets. Seattle shall begin making quarterly payments for such utility-related work on July 1, 2003, or 60 days after receipt of Sound Transit's invoice, whichever is later. The first quarterly payment shall be in an amount equal to the value of all Sound Transit-performed work completed and documented in Sound Transit's invoice described in Section 4.2.1.6, subject to the maximum annual contributions shown in Section 4.2.1.4.

 4.2.1.2 City-Performed Work. In the exercise of its authority as the owner of the right-of-way and under Seattle Municipal Code Section 15.12.130, Seattle may cause Seattle Public Utilities and Seattle City Light to perform utility work under this Section 4.2.1 on or after January 1, 2001, and the value of any such utility work done by Seattle shall offset the amount of payments due from Seattle to Sound Transit under this Section 4.2.1, subject to the maximum annual contributions shown in Section 4.2.1.4. Any such utility work performed by Seattle during calendar year 2001 that is eligible to offset the total amount due will be described in the Utility Plan. Any such utility work performed by Seattle beginning January 1, 2002 will be described in quarterly reports beginning in calendar year 2002 that will detail the value of utility work (including standard Seattle Public Utilities and Seattle City Light overhead charges). Seattle and Sound Transit will agree on a template for the quarterly reports as part of the final Utility Plan pursuant to Section 6. Seattle shall continue to submit quarterly reports until Sound Transit has received a total of $21.5 million in payments and offsets.

 4.2.1.3 Non-Exclusive Transit Way Agreement. Seattle is obligated to reimburse Sound Transit for the costs of utility work under this Agreement, and to perform some of the utility work under this Agreement at Seattle's expense, notwithstanding Subsection 3.5 of the Non-Exclusive Transit Way Agreement, unless prevented from doing so by an uncontrollable event as set forth in Section 11. However, Sound Transit remains obligated under Subsection 3.5 of the Non- Exclusive Transit Way Agreement for all costs related to utilities owned by Seattle not specifically exempted by this Agreement.

 4.2.1.4 Contribution Schedule. The total amount of money to be paid by Seattle to Sound Transit, plus the total value of all utility work performed by the City that is eligible to offset the total amount due under this Section 4.2.1, shall not exceed $21.5 million. The table below shows the maximum payments/value per year for Seattle City Light and Seattle Public Utilities.

 UTILITY CONTRIBUTIONS

 Year Seattle City Light Seattle Public Utilities Total 2003 $3,000,000 $1,000,000 $4,000,000 2004 $2,500,000 $1,000,000 $3,500,000 2005 $4,600,000 $1,000,000 $5,600,000 2006 $7,400,000 $1,000,000 $8,400,000 Total $17,500,000 $4,000,000 $21,500,000

 4.2.1.5 Sound Transit's Construction Schedule. The amounts shown in each year of the utility contribution table in Section 4.2.1.4 are subject to extension due to delays in Sound Transit's construction schedule. These adjustments will not impact the total contribution of $21.5 million to be paid by Seattle for utility work. Any acceleration to Sound Transit's construction schedule, however, will not result in an acceleration of Seattle's payment for utility work beyond the utility contributions schedule in Section 4.2.1.4 unless agreed to by Seattle through revisions to the Utility Plan.

 4.2.1.6 Invoice and Payments. All Seattle payments to Sound Transit under this Section 4.2.1 shall be made within 60 days after Seattle receives Sound Transit's quarterly report and invoice. Seattle and Sound Transit will agree on a template for the quarterly reports as part of the final Utility Plan pursuant to Section 6. In order to qualify for reimbursement by Seattle for work completed in accordance with Section 4.2.1 of this Agreement, Sound Transit must provide documentation of the contractor's costs in an agreed upon template that: (1) states that Sound Transit has reviewed and approved the work; (2) verifies the work is eligible for reimbursement by Seattle; and (3) includes actual costs and backup information as determined by standard reimbursement policies of Seattle.

 4.2.1.7 Seattle's Waiver of Sound Transit's Obligation. Seattle hereby waives and releases Sound Transit from its obligations under Section 3.5 of the "Non-Exclusive Transit Way Agreement" authorized by Ordinance 119975 to the extent of $21.5 million.

 4.2.2 City Payments to the Community Development Account. In addition to the supporting contributions described in the preceding Section 4.2.1, the City shall pay a total of $21.3 million directly to the Fund for the Community Development Account subject to lesser payments under Section 4.2.2.3. The City shall make every effort to fulfill at least part of its payment obligations under this Section 4.2.2 in the form of Community Development Block Grant or other sources of federal funds. A failure to obtain such federal funding shall, however, not relieve Seattle of its obligations under this Section 4.2.2. The City shall deposit its payments to the Fund as provided in the Operating Plan and shall make the payments under the terms and conditions set forth in this Section 4.2.2.

 4.2.2.1 Payment Schedule A. Not later than sixty (60) days after the approval of the Operating Plan or achievement or waiver of the conditions precedent designated for Seattle's benefit under Section 4.1, whichever is later, Seattle shall make an initial $2 million payment to the Community Development Account, provided that the initial payment shall not be made before January 1, 2003. In subsequent years, Seattle shall make annual payments, in the same month as the initial payment, in addition to the initial payment, according to the following schedule, and subject to possible revisions pursuant to Section 4.2.2.2:

 Year City Payment Year 1 Initial $2,000,000 payment Year 2 $2,000,000 Year 3 $2,000,000 Year 4 $2,000,000 Year 5 $2,000,000 Year 6 $2,000,000 Year 7 $1,500,000 Total $13,500,000

 4.2.2.2 Revisions to Payment Schedule A. The schedule specified in Section 4.2.2.1 for payments after the initial payment is subject to the following fiscal emergency provision. For purposes of this Agreement, a "fiscal emergency" shall arise when total City General Fund revenue for a year is reasonably projected in the adopted budget to be less than the revenue projected, at the time of adoption of the budget for that next year, to be received in the previous year (the year during which the budget for the next year is adopted). In the event of a fiscal emergency, the payment amount in Section 4.2.2.1 for that next year can be reduced by up to the percentage decline in expected General Fund revenue or by five percent (5%), whichever is less. The reduced payment amount shall be made up and paid in the following year, provided that the percentage growth in total City General Fund revenue reasonably projected to be received in that following year over the revenue projected to be received in the preceding year, is at least as high as the ratio of (a) the reduced payment amount to be made up and paid in that following year, to (b) the payment amount listed in Section 4.2.2.1 for that following year. If needed to comply with this section, a payment shall be made in Year 8, to bring the total paid under Section 4.2.2.1 to $13.5 million.

 4.2.2.3 Payment Schedule B. Seattle shall make payments to the Community Development Account in a total amount of up to $7.8 million in addition to the payments described in Section 4.2.2.1. The following table shows the estimated schedule for these payments, and is based on the estimated annual retail sales and use tax revenue that Seattle will receive due to taxable sales in Seattle for Link light rail construction. This estimated schedule for payments is based on the attached Sound Transit construction schedule (Attachment A).

 Year Estimated City Payment 2002 $100,000 2003 $800,000 2004 $700,000 2005 $1,000,000 2006 $2,300,000 2007 $1,600,000 2008 $1,300,000 Total Estimated City Payments $7,800,000

 4.2.2.4 Revisions to Payment Schedule B. The estimated annual amounts shown in the table in Section 4.2.2.3 are subject to change due to revisions to Sound Transit's construction schedule. Not later than January 31 of each year, Sound Transit will submit to Seattle an updated schedule showing anticipated construction for Central Link light rail by calendar year for the remainder of the project and completed construction for the previous year. The amount that Seattle shall pay in the then-current year shall equal the estimated retail sales and use tax revenue that Seattle will receive in that year due to taxable sales in Seattle for Central Link light rail, plus or minus any adjustment to reconcile the revised estimate of the previous year's sales tax revenue compared to the original estimate of the previous year's payments. Seattle shall be responsible for calculating any adjustments. Notwithstanding any adjustments to the estimated schedule for payments shown in the table in Section 4.2.2.3, the total amount that Seattle shall pay under Section 4.2.2.3 shall be the total amount of sales and use tax revenue that Seattle receives due to taxable sales in Seattle for Central Link light rail, estimated when the project has been completed, up to a maximum of $7.8 million.

 4.2.2.5 Payment Cap. Notwithstanding any other term of this Agreement, the total amount to be paid by Seattle to the Community Development Account shall not exceed $21.3 million.

 4.3 Sound Transit Payments to the Supplemental Mitigation Account Sound Transit shall pay a total of $21.5 million into the Supplemental Mitigation Account as described in the Operating Plan.

 4.3.1 Initial Payments. Notwithstanding the conditions precedent set forth in Section 4.1, Sound Transit shall make initial payments up to $3,000,000 into the Supplemental Mitigation Account (the "Initial Payments"). Such Initial Payments shall be made on a monthly basis in amounts necessary to pay for the administrative and operating expenses and eligible supplemental mitigation expenses of the Fund as projected in advance by the Fund administrator. The first Initial Payment shall be made within sixty days after both (a) the approval of the Operating Plan and (b) the achievement or waiver by Sound Transit of the condition precedent under Section 4.1.2 (regarding establishment/staffing of an entity to administer the Fund and entry into a contract with that entity). Sixty (60) days after the date on which the conditions precedent set forth in Section 4.1 have been satisfied or waived by Sound Transit, Sound Transit shall pay into the Supplemental Mitigation Account $3,000,000 less the total of all Initial Payments made to date.

 4.3.2 Subsequent Annual Payments. One year after Sound Transit makes the first Initial Payment, or sixty (60) days after the date on which the conditions precedent set forth in Section 4.1 have been satisfied or waived by the parties, whichever is later, Sound Transit shall make a payment of $7,000,000 to the Supplemental Mitigation Account (the "Year 2 Payment"). Each annual payment thereafter shall be made in the same month as the Year 2 Payment was made and shall be made according to the schedule set forth below unless modified as described in Section 4.3.3.

 Year Sound Transit Payments Year 1 Initial payments: $3,000,000 Year 2 $7,000,000 Year 3 $2,500,000 Year 4 $2,500,000 Year 5 $6,500,000 Total $21,500,000

 4.3.3 Payment Schedule Acceleration. No later than 270 days after Sound Transit makes the Year 2 Payment, and on an annual basis thereafter, Sound Transit shall consult with the administrator of the Fund to determine whether the payment schedule for Years 3 through 5 should be accelerated to achieve the purposes of the Supplemental Mitigation Account. If the Fund administrator and Sound Transit agree to an accelerated payment schedule, any additional cost to Sound Transit associated with the accelerated payment schedule shall be deducted from the total payments Sound Transit is obligated to make under this Agreement. Such deductions shall reflect the differences between Sound Transit's actual payments and the schedule of payments under Section 4.3.2 as well as appropriate discounting to reflect accelerated payments by Sound Transit under this Section 4.3.3. Under an accelerated payment schedule, Sound Transit would be obligated to make payments with a future value no greater than the future value of the original payment schedule as delineated in this Section 4.3 using the borrowing rate included in the Sound Transit 25-year financial plan in effect on the date of any adjustment (the current financial plan includes a rate of 5.85% annually). The process for accelerating the payment schedule, including the method for determining additional costs to Sound Transit, if any, shall be set forth in the contract between Sound Transit and the entity administering the Fund.

 4.4 Use of Excess; Repaid Funds. In the event a portion of the payments made to the Supplemental Mitigation Account remain after the purposes of the Operating Plan for such Account have been met, or in the event a portion of the funds distributed from the Account as "advances" has been repaid, the funds shall remain in the Fund and be used within its geographic boundaries. The funds shall be used to promote transit ridership in a manner developed in consultation with the community and Seattle, including but not limited to, transit oriented development. In the alternative, the Sound Transit Board may propose additional purposes for such funds. Such additional purposes shall be developed in consultation with the community located within the geographic boundaries of the Fund and with Seattle, and shall be implemented only upon amendment of the Operating Plan in the same manner as the initial Operating Plan was adopted (by Sound Transit Board and Seattle City Council actions).

 4.5 Ongoing Conditions to Funding. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, the parties shall have the right to discontinue making further payments required to be made under this Agreement into the Fund and to the Link light rail project under the circumstances described below. Neither party shall exercise this right without first consulting with the other through the dispute resolution process outlined in Section 8 below and attempting to reach satisfactory resolution through that process.

 4.5.1 Cessation of Seattle Payments. The parties acknowledge that each has a role in the implementation of Link light rail within Seattle, and agree to exercise best efforts to facilitate the timely implementation of the project. Notwithstanding such best efforts, and taking into consideration all relevant circumstances, if Sound Transit does not diligently construct Link light rail, as approved by the Sound Transit Board in Resolution 2001-16 on November 29, 2001, in a timely and fiscally responsible manner, Seattle may cease further payments. Seattle may exercise this right only through a resolution adopted by the City Council, with the Mayor concurring, or by a resolution adopted by a two-thirds vote of the City Council.

 4.5.2 Reciprocal Rights. If a party fails for any reason (including, but not limited to, insolvency, injunction, failure of a condition precedent, or exercise of a right or remedy under this Agreement, including the exercise of the right to cease payment under Section 4.5.1 or as a result of an uncontrollable event described in Section 11) to make the payments and contributions under this Agreement, then in addition to its legal remedies, the other party may cease further payments.

 5. Oversight of the Fund. The parties shall share oversight responsibilities for the Fund. Seattle shall oversee the Community Development Account, its administration and expenditures, and Sound Transit shall oversee the Supplemental Mitigation Account, its administration and expenditures.

 5.1 Oversight Objectives and Requirements. The parties shall oversee the Fund such that the objectives set forth in this Section 5.1 are achieved and may enter into such contracts or agreements with one another and with third parties as may be necessary to do so.

 5.1.1 Administration and Recordkeeping. The Fund shall be administered in a professional manner by qualified personnel, consistent with this Agreement and with the Operating Plan. The administrator(s) of the Fund shall maintain records that are adequate to fully document Fund finances, including all funds received, income, investments, and expenditures, and the reasons for all expenditures. Records shall be maintained in a manner and duration necessary to satisfy both parties' record retention needs.

 5.1.2 Reports and Audits. The administrator(s) of the Fund shall provide regular reports to both Seattle and Sound Transit as to Fund finances, including all income, investments and expenditures and the reasons for all expenditures. Each party shall conduct appropriate regular audits of the account it oversees, shall take immediate steps to investigate irregularities, and shall take appropriate and prompt steps to address improper or unlawful conduct. Each party shall notify the other in writing of such investigations and corrective measures taken.

 5.2 Performance Evaluation. The parties (through Sound Transit's Light Rail Director, Seattle's Director of Economic Development, and the Executive Director of the entity administering the Fund) shall consult at least quarterly to evaluate the performance of the entity administering the Fund and to discuss any oversight issues that have arisen in the past year. Either party may request such additional consultations regarding performance as the party deems necessary to ensure adequate administration of the Fund.

 6. Utility Plan. Sound Transit and Seattle shall jointly develop a written Utility Plan that will establish a schedule of utility projects eligible for payment or offset under Section 4.2.1 of this Agreement. This plan shall include a listing of the utility work that counts towards Seattle's $21.5 million contribution under Section 4.2.1.

 6.1 Schedule. A draft Utility Plan shall be developed not later than three (3) months after approval of this Agreement based on the best information available and a final Utility Plan shall be completed not later than six (6) months after approval of this Agreement, with annual or more frequent updates as needed. Notwithstanding any revisions over time to the cost of individual utility projects, Seattle's contributions under Section 4.2.1 shall not exceed $21.5 million in payments and offsets. The Utility Plan shall include an estimate of the dollar value of each project for purposes of payment by or offset to Seattle under Section 4.2.1 of this Agreement. It is understood that this dollar value will likely change based on the actual costs of each project. The parties, however, will make a good faith effort to provide as accurate an estimate as possible in the Utility Plan. Estimates will be updated when applicable contractor bids are opened and contracts are awarded.

 6.2 Utility Work. Seattle and Sound Transit will perform utility work consistent with the Utility Plan, making practical adjustments to the work performed in response to actual field and construction conditions, and scheduling circumstances. The Utility Plan shall be supplemented with specific scope and project information for each specific project to be undertaken.

 6.3 Utility Plan Recordkeeping. Each party shall maintain records that are adequate to document all utility costs and expenditures for purposes of reimbursement or offset under Section 4.2.1 of this Agreement.

 6.3.1 Duration. Each party shall maintain records that are adequate to document all utility costs and expenditures under this Agreement and to document compliance with the terms of this Agreement. These records shall be maintained for a minimum of ten (10) years after all funds have been paid or offset under this Agreement and for any additional period of time during which the party in possession of the records has notice that there is an audit or dispute to which the records may be relevant. Each party shall have the right to inspect, audit and copy the records of the other party required to be maintained under this Agreement, or any part of them, with seven (7) day advance notice after having made reasonable arrangements with the other party to do so.

 6.3.2 Records of Payment and Offset. Sound Transit shall maintain complete records of money received under this Agreement and of all offsets credited to Seattle for utility work performed by Seattle under this Agreement. Sound Transit also shall in writing promptly acknowledge its receipt of payments, and offsets credited to Seattle.

 6.3.3 Prompt Offset for City Utility Expenditures; Record of Offsets. Within sixty (60) days after it has received Seattle's quarterly report of utility work done by Seattle under Section 4.2.1 of this Agreement, Sound Transit shall credit Seattle for the undisputed dollar value of the work as reported by Seattle; this credit shall be used to offset and reduce the total amount to be paid by Seattle for utility costs under Section 4.2.1 of this Agreement. Sound Transit shall report each such offset to Seattle within thirty (30) days after it has been credited, and shall maintain complete records of all offsets. The parties shall address disputed values through the process described in Section 8 below.

 6.3.4 Annual Accounting Review. In the fourth quarter of each year, Sound Transit, Seattle Public Utilities, and Seattle City Light will reconcile offsets and payments.

 6.3.5 Audits. Each party reserves the right to conduct audits of the other party's records required to be maintained under this Agreement and which relate to matters arising under this Agreement, or to retain an independent Certified Public Accountant to conduct such audits.

 7. Default and Remedies. If either party defaults on its obligations under this Agreement, the other party shall have all remedies available at law or equity, in addition to those remedies specifically allowed by this Agreement.
