 AN ORDINANCE relating to the revision of gas piping permit fees; amending Section 22.900G.030 of the Seattle Municipal Code.

 BE IT ORDAINED BY THE CITY OF SEATTLE AS FOLLOWS:

 Section 1. Effective January 1, 2003, the Seattle Municipal Code 22.900G.030, is amended as follows:

 SMC 22.900G.030 Fees for review by the Seattle - King County Department of Public Health.

 A. Fees for fuel gas piping shall be collected by the Director of Public Health. The basic fee for gas piping installations is ~~Seventy-five~~Ninety-five Dollars ~~($75)~~($95)  for one (1) ~~(through four (4)~~ outlet~~s~~, and Ten Dollars ($10) for each additional outlet. A minimum of ~~Seventy- five~~Ninety-five Dollars ~~($75)~~($95) is nonrefundable.

 B. The fee shall not apply to the installation of any domestic hot- water heaters or any other domestic gas-fired appliance connected to a plumbing system whenever such appliance or heater is included in a plumbing installation for which a basic plumbing permit has been issued.

 C. A reinspection fee for fuel gas piping of ~~Forty~~One Hundred Dollars ~~($40)~~($100) may be assessed for each inspection where such portion of work for which inspection is called for is not complete or when corrections called for are not made. This is not to be interpreted as requiring inspection fees the first time a job is rejected for failure to comply with the requirements of this Code, but as controlling the practice of calling for inspection or reinspection.

 Reinspection fees may be assessed when the permit is not properly posted on the work site, the work to be inspected is not under test, and for failure to make required corrections. To obtain a reinspection the applicant shall file an application therefor in writing upon a form furnished for that purpose, and pay the reinspection fee in accordance with this Code. In instances in which reinspection fees have been assessed, no additional inspection of the work will be performed until the required fees have been paid.

 Section 2. This ordinance shall take effect and be in force thirty (30) days from and after its approval by the Mayor, but if not approved and returned by the Mayor within ten (10) days after presentation, it shall take effect as provided by Municipal Code Section 1.04.020.
