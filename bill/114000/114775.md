 AN ORDINANCE relating to the development of multi-family housing; creating a new Chapter 5.73 of the Seattle Municipal Code to implement RCW Chapter 84.14 to provide for exemption from ad valorem property taxation for qualifying multi-family housing in designated residential target areas within the City, designating certain areas as residential targeted areas, and providing for annual program reporting.

 WHEREAS, Washington state law, RCW Chapter 84.14, adopted by the legislature in 1995, provides for the exemption from ad valorem property taxation for the value of eligible improvements associated with qualifying multi-unit housing located in residential target areas and authorizes the City to adopt necessary procedures to implement the State law; and

 WHEREAS, the stated purpose of RCW Chapter 84.14 is to increase residential opportunities by stimulating the construction of new multi-family housing and the rehabilitation of existing vacant and underutilized buildings for multi-family housing in areas where the City finds there are insufficient residential opportunities; and

 WHEREAS, the City Council finds that those areas within the City designated as urban center villages, hub urban villages or residential urban villages in the Land Use Element of the City's Comprehensive Plan satisfy the requirements of an "urban center" as defined under RCW 84.14.010(1); and

 WHEREAS, the City Council solicited public comment regarding designation of residential target areas at public hearings on December 16,2003 and March 1, 2004 and at a Council committee meeting on February 20, 2004; and

 WHEREAS, the City finds that the areas designated as residential targeted areas in this Ordinance are each located within an urban center as defined in this ordinance, that each area lacks sufficient available, desirable and convenient residential housing to meet the needs of the public who would be likely to live in such area if desirable, attractive and livable residences were available; and that the property tax exemption program implemented by this Ordinance will encourage increased residential opportunities in urban centers within the City and stimulate the construction of new multifamily housing and the rehabilitation of existing vacant and underutilized buildings for multifamily housing in urban centers having insufficient housing opportunities; and

 WHEREAS, certain areas within the City lack sufficient housing opportunities to meet the needs of low and moderate income households who would be likely to live in such areas if affordable residences were available, and

 WHEREAS, it is the City's intent to preserve and protect buildings, objects, sites, and neighborhoods with historic, cultural, architectural, engineering or geographic significance located within the City, as provided in those chapters of the Seattle Municipal Code relating to landmarks preservation, landmark districts, historical districts and special review districts; and the property tax exemption program established by this ordinance will support and further the goals and purposes expressed in those provisions of the Code; and

 WHEREAS, it is the City's goal to preserve, when appropriate, existing multifamily low-income housing in neighborhoods where such housing now exists, and to use the property tax exemption program to support and not hinder this goal; and

 WHEREAS, Ordinance 119237 passed on November 30, 1998, enacted a property tax exemption program that expired in 2002, and a new ordinance is required to enact a new program; Now, Therefore;

 BE IT ORDAINED BY THE CITY OF SEATTLE AS FOLLOWS:

 Section 1. A new Chapter 5.73, to be titled "2004 Multifamily Housing Property Tax Exemption Program" is hereby added to the Seattle Municipal Code, to read as follows:

 Section 5.73.010 Purpose

 A. The purposes of this chapter are:

 1. To encourage more multifamily housing opportunities within the City;

 2. To stimulate the construction of new multifamily housing and the rehabilitation of existing vacant and underutilized buildings for multifamily housing;

 3. To increase the supply of multifamily housing opportunities within the City for low and moderate income households;

 4. To assist in accomplishing the planning goals required under the Growth Management Act, RCW chapter 36.70A, as implemented by the City's Comprehensive Plan, by increasing the supply of multifamily housing opportunities in urban centers that are behind in meeting their 20-year residential growth targets, i.e., areas that have met 25% or less of their 20-year residential growth target as indicated in the January 2004 update to Appendix 1 of the March 2003 Department of Planning and Development report "Monitoring Our Progress: Seattle's Comprehensive Plan;"

 5. To promote community development, affordable housing, and neighborhood revitalization in residential targeted areas;

 6. To preserve and protect buildings, objects, sites, and neighborhoods with historic, cultural, architectural, engineering or geographic significance located within the City;

 7. To encourage the creation of both rental and homeownership "workforce housing," i.e., housing affordable to households earning between 60% and 80% of median income, that would not otherwise be developed by the market in residential targeted areas.

 8. To encourage the creation of mixed-income housing that is affordable to households with a range of incomes in residential targeted areas.

 B. Any one or more of these purposes may be furthered by the designation of a residential targeted area under this chapter.

 Section 5.73.020 Definitions

 A. "Affordable rent" means that the annual rent for the unit does not exceed 30% of the percentage of median annual income designated by this chapter for qualifying units for the residential targeted area in which the unit is located.

 B. "Affordable Unit" means a unit that is rented at an Affordable Rent to an Income Eligible Occupant.

 C. "Assessor" means the King County Assessor.

 F. "Household annual income" means the aggregate annual income of all persons over eighteen (18) years of age residing within the same household for a period of at least one month.

 G. "Income Eligible Occupant" means that the household annual income at initial occupancy of the tenant household that will occupy the rental unit, at the time of the tenant household's initial occupancy, is no greater than the percentage of median income designated in this chapter. A person shall not cease to be an Income Eligible Occupant solely because the household annual income exceeds the annual income limit set forth in this chapter after the date of initial occupancy.

 H. "Median income" means annual family median income for the Seattle- Bellevue-Everett Primary Metropolitan Statistical Area, as published from time to time by HUD, and as adjusted for household size according to the method used by HUD for income limits in subsidized housing. For purposes of rent limits, median income generally is adjusted according to the presumed family size based on the number of bedrooms in a unit, consistent with HUD rules for the HOME program.

 M. "Rehabilitation improvements" means (1) modifications to an existing building, the residential portion of which has been vacant for at least 12 months prior to application for exemption under this chapter, that are made to achieve a condition of substantial compliance with the applicable building and construction codes contained in SMC Chapter 22; or (2) modifications to an existing occupied residential building or mixed use building that contains occupied residential units, that add at least four multifamily housing units.

 N. "Residential targeted area" means an area within an urban center that has been so designated by the City Council pursuant to this chapter.

 O. "Substantial Compliance" means compliance with the applicable building and construction codes contained in SMC Chapter 22 that is typically required for rehabilitation as opposed to new construction.

 P. "Urban center" has the same meaning as "urban center" as defined in RCW 84.14.010, and for purposes of this chapter includes, among other areas, any neighborhood that is within an area designated as either an urban center village, a hub urban village or a residential urban village in the Land Use Element of the City's Comprehensive Plan.

 Section 5.73.030 Residential Targeted Areas -- Criteria - Designation.

 2. Whether the area is an Economically Distressed Area;

 3. Whether the City has identified the area or neighborhood by Resolution as one in which the City wants to encourage the development of mixed-income housing, including affordable housing;

 4. Whether the area or neighborhood was designated as a residential targeted neighborhood in the City's prior Multifamily Tax Exemption program, RCW chapter 5.72, and is one in which the City wants to encourage the development of mixed-income housing, including affordable housing.

 C. At any time the Council may, by ordinance, in its sole discretion, amend or rescind the designation of a residential targeted area pursuant to the same procedural requirements set forth in RCW 84.14.040 for original designation.

 E. For rehabilitation or conversion of existing occupied buildings, there shall be no "displacement" of existing residential tenants, as such term is defined in Section 22.210.030(E);

 F. For new construction, where an existing rental housing building that contained four or more occupied dwelling units was demolished on the site of the new project within 12 months prior to application for exemption under this chapter, the owner shall agree, on terms and conditions satisfactory to the Director, to replace any units within such building that were rented to tenants who received a tenant relocation assistance payment under Chapter 22.210, subject to the following requirements:

 1. For the first ten calendar years of operation of the replacement units, the replacement units shall be affordable at or below 50% of median income.

 2. Replacement may be accomplished either as part of the new construction for which application for exemption is made under this chapter, or through the new construction of additional multifamily housing at another location, or through the substantial rehabilitation of vacant multifamily housing, or through the preservation of multifamily housing that is rented at the time of application to tenants with household annual income at or below 50% of median income, and that the Director determines would otherwise be converted to a use other than rental to tenants with such income.

 3. The replacement housing shall be completed, and a temporary or permanent certificate of occupancy shall be issued, within three years from the date of approval of the application, provided that the Director may extend the time for completion if the Director finds that:

 a. The failure to complete the replacement housing is due to circumstances beyond the owner's control;

 b. The owner has been acting and may reasonably be expected to continue to act in good faith and with due diligence; and

 b. A minimum of 25% of the units shall be rented at Affordable Rents to Income Eligible Occupants whose household income is at or below 65% of Median Income; or

 c. A minimum of 30% of the units shall be rented at Affordable Rents to Income Eligible Occupants whose household income is at or below 70% of Median Income.

 2. Right of First Offer.

 a. The City or its assignee shall have and retain, for the life of the exemption granted under this chapter and for one additional year thereafter, a written right of first offer under terms and conditions approved by the Director consistent with this subsection.

 b. Such right of first offer shall be included in the contract with the City required under subsection 5.73.060 of this chapter.

 c. This right of first offer shall require that the owner, prior to placing the rental multifamily housing on the market for sale, shall inform the City in writing of the owner's intent to sell the rental multifamily housing. Following receipt of the owner's notice of intent to sell, the City or the City's assignee shall have twenty (20) days to present the owner with a written offer setting forth the price, terms and conditions under which the City or its assignee is prepared to purchase the rental multifamily housing.

 d. Upon receipt of the offer, the City or its assignee shall have thirty calendar days in which to enter into a real estate purchase and sales agreement with the owner containing the price, terms and conditions described in the offer or other price, terms and conditions agreed to by the parties.

 e. In the event that the owner submits a notice of intent to sell to the City and no sale to the City or its assignee occurs for reasons not the fault of the owner, the owner shall not, with the exception provided below, have further obligations under this provision for a period of one year from the date the notice is received by the City. Provided, however, that in the event the City or its assignee makes an offer to purchase the rental multifamily housing but no sale occurs, the owner may not offer the rental multifamily housing for sale to a third party at a price and under terms and conditions more favorable to the buyer than the terms offered by the City for a period of one year from the date the offer is received by the owner.

 H. Owner-occupied Multifamily housing projects-Affordability and Right of First Refusal.

 1. Affordability.

 a. For owner-occupied multifamily housing, units eligible for the exemption must have a sales price at initial sale after the grant of exemption that does not exceed the FHA mortgage limit for Seattle, as adjusted annually, and must be sold to households with incomes at time of purchase at or below 80 percent of Median Income.

 b. The contract with the City required under Section 5.73.060 of this chapter shall identify those units that are designated to meet the affordability requirements of this subsection H.

 2. Right of First Refusal. For those owner-occupied units identified to meet the affordability requirement under this subsection H, the City shall have and retain, for the life of the exemption granted under this chapter, a written right of first refusal under terms and conditions approved by the Director, exercisable in the event the owner receives a bona fide offer to buy the property from an owner whose household income exceeds the affordability limits in this Section 5.73.040, giving the City or its assignee the right to purchase the property on substantially the same terms as such bona fide offer. Such right of first refusal shall be included in the contract with the City required under Section 5.73.060 of this chapter.

 I. The affordability requirements contained in subsections G and H apply for the period of time the multifamily housing is receiving the tax exemption. If, in calculating the number of units needed to comply with the affordability requirements of Subsection G, the resulting number of Affordable Units is a fraction, then the number of Affordable Units shall be rounded up to the next whole number.

 J. The mix and configuration of housing units (e.g., studio, one- bedroom, two-bedroom, etc.) used to meet the affordability requirements of subsection G shall be substantially proportional to the mix and configuration of the total housing units in the project; provided that all units of two or more bedrooms may be combined into a single category for the purpose of compliance with this provision. When the project contains more than one building, all of the Affordable Units required by subsection G may not be located in the same building.

 K. Affordable Units required under subsection G shall have substantially the same level of interior fixtures and quality of finish as market rate units in the project.

 L. For new construction of multifamily housing, the applicant shall complete the design review process under Chapter 23.41, whether or not the multifamily housing would be subject to design review under Chapter 23.41 if the owner had not applied for property tax exemption under this chapter. For multifamily housing not subject to mandatory design review under Section 23.41.004A, the applicant shall complete administrative design review under Section 23.41.016.

 M. The applicant shall obtain a certificate of approval, permit, or other approval under Chapter 25.12, Landmarks Preservation Ordinance, Chapter 23.66, Special Review Districts, or those provisions of Chapter 25.16, Chapter 25.20, Chapter 25.22, Chapter 25.24, or Chapter 25.28, relating to Landmark or Historical Districts, if such certificate of approval, permit or other approval is required under those chapters. Such certificate of approval, permit or other approval shall satisfy the requirement under subsection L that the applicant complete design review if design review is not mandatory under Section 23.41.004A.

 N. The multifamily housing must comply with all applicable zoning requirements, land use regulations, and building and housing code requirements contained in Chapters 22, 23 and 25 of the Seattle Municipal Code.

 O. For the duration of the exemption granted under this chapter, the multifamily housing and the property on which it is located shall have no violations of applicable zoning requirements, land use regulations, and building and housing code requirements contained in Chapters 22, 23 and 25 of the Seattle Municipal Code for which the Department of Planning and Development has issued a notice of violation that is not resolved by a certificate of compliance, certificate of release, or withdrawal within the time period for compliance provided in such notice of violation and any extension of the time period for compliance granted by the Director of the Department of Planning and Development.

 P. New construction of multifamily housing and rehabilitation improvements must be scheduled to be completed within three years from the date of approval of the application.

The applicant shall submit to the Director a written request stating the grounds for the extension together with a fee of $150.00 for the City's administrative cost to process the request. The Director may grant an extension if the Director determines that:
