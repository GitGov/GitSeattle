 PROPERTY USE AND DEVELOPMENT AGREEMENT

 This agreement is executed this date in favor of the City of Seattle, a Municipal corporation (herein called "City"), by Conner Homes, owner of property legally described herein (herein called "Owner").

 RECITALS

 1. Seattle Municipal Code ("SMC") 23.34.004 authorizes the Seattle City Council to approve contract rezones in which the landowner agrees to self-imposed restrictions upon the use and development of property as a condition of rezone approval.

 2. The Owner has a fee simple or other beneficial interest in property described in paragraph three and wants the City Council to rezone the property pursuant to SMC 23.34.004.

 3. The property that is subject to this agreement ("Property") is :

 Lots 1, 2, 3, 4, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, and the west 15 feet of Lot 7, Block 38, Woodlawn Addition to Green Lake, according to the Plat thereof recorded in Volume 6 of Plats, Page 20, Records of King County, Washington.

 Section 1. Pursuant to SMC 23.34.004, Owner hereby covenants, bargains and agrees, on behalf of itself and its successors and assigns, that it will comply with the following limitations and conditions in consideration of the rezone of a portion of the Property from NC2-40' and C1-40', to NC2-65' / P2.

 A. The changes in zone designation are established only for development of a building with substantially the same design and with substantially the same amenities and improvements in the pedestrian environment, both public and private, as the one depicted and approved by the Department of Design, Construction and Land Use (DCLU) through its design review process, or, if appealed, by the Hearing Examiner. A.

 B. Included in the improvements to the public infrastructure shall be: curb bulbs at the two street corners adjacent to the Property; pedestrian pole lighting at each residential entry; street trees and large planters with low vegetation, and new sidewalks and curbs as necessary in general conformance with the design attached hereto as Exhibit A, subject to any changes required by the DCLU in consultation with the Seattle Department of Transportation (herein called "SeaTran").

 C. Included in the amenities to be provided on the site shall be a curved pedestrian courtyard, approximately 1,500-sq. ft. in area, at sidewalk level providing an area of pedestrian extension from the sidewalk lined by retail frontages and incorporating two pedestrian-level pole lamps.

 C. C. Section 2. This Property Use and Development Agreement ("Agreement") shall be recorded in the records of King County by the City Clerk. The covenants hereof shall be deemed to attach to and run with the Property and shall be binding upon the Owner, its heirs, successors and assigns, and shall apply to after-acquired title of the Owner of the Property; provided the covenants herein and the rezone shall expire and be of no force and effect Six (6) years from the effective date of the approval of this rezone unless an application is filed for a Master Use Permit (MUP) for the building contemplated in the attached Exhibit A.

 Section 3. This agreement may be amended or modified by agreement between Owner and the City provided such amendment agreement shall be approved by the legislative authority of the City by ordinance. Nothing in this Agreement shall prevent the City Council from making such further amendments to the Land Use Code or exercising the City's police power as it may deem necessary in the public interest. Owner agrees that nothing in this Agreement is intended to authorize any use or dimension not otherwise permitted in a Neighborhood Commercial Two zone with a 65-foot height limit and a Pedestrian Two overlay designation (NC2- 65' / P2). The conditions contained in this Agreement are based on the unique circumstances applicable to this Property, and this Agreement is not intended to establish precedent for other rezones in the surrounding area.

 Section 4. This Agreement is made for the benefit of the City and for the benefit of the owners of the property within 300 feet of the Property and either the City or any such property owners may institute and prosecute any proceeding at law or in equity to enforce this Agreement.

 Section 5. Owner acknowledges that compliance with the conditions of this Agreement is a condition of the subject rezone and that if Owner avails itself of the benefits of this rezone but then fails to comply with the conditions of this Agreement with the City, in addition to pursuing any other remedy, the City may revoke the rezone by ordinance and require the use of the Property to conform to the requirements of the previously existing C1-40' and NC2-40' zones.
