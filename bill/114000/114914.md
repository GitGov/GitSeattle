 ORDINANCE _________________

 AN ORDINANCE relating to the Cedar River Watershed; accepting four deeds to certain real property in Section 23, Township 22 North, Range 7 East, W.M., in King County, Washington; declaring as surplus certain easement rights with respect to said real property; and authorizing the release of said easement rights.

 WHEREAS, the Cedar River Municipal Watershed has been the primary source of water supply for the City of Seattle for more than 100 years; and

 WHEREAS, throughout this period, the City has followed the policy of acquiring ownership of lands within and immediately adjoining the watershed's hydrographic boundary as the primary basis for protecting the high quality of Cedar River water; and

 WHEREAS, the acquisition of the remaining federally-owned lands in the watershed in 1996 increased the City's ownership to approximately 99.6% of all land lying within the watershed's hydrographic boundary; and

 WHEREAS, in 1998, the owner of the largest remaining non-City property in the watershed (the "Property") laid out a residential development and began marketing building lots on it; and

 WHEREAS, the City concluded that such residential development would be incompatible with its watershed protection program and would present unacceptable risks to source water quality; and

 WHEREAS, the 1999 Water Capital Improvement Program contemplated the City's purchase of the Property, and Ordinance 119389 specifically authorized such purchase at fair market value; and

 WHEREAS, in 1999 and 2000, the City acquired the Property in four separate transactions prior to the construction of any residential structures; and

 WHEREAS, the developer had constructed an access road across the Property and lands of an adjoining owner; and

 WHEREAS, such access road is not needed for management of the watershed or any other utility purposes and instead represents maintenance and security problems; and

 WHEREAS, in order for the City to remove the access road, the mutual easement rights granted by the previous owner of the Property and the owner of the adjoining land must be rescinded; NOW, THEREFORE,

 BE IT ORDAINED BY THE CITY OF SEATTLE AS FOLLOWS:

 Section 1. That certain deed for a portion of the Property recorded under King County Recording No. 9904162994 and attached hereto as Attachment 1, is hereby accepted, and said real property is placed under the jurisdiction of Seattle Public Utilities.

 Section 2. That certain deed for a portion of the Property recorded under King County Recording No. 9905251632 and attached hereto as Attachment 2, is hereby accepted, and said real property is placed under the jurisdiction of Seattle Public Utilities.

Pursuant to the provisions of RCW 35.94.040 and after public hearing, the rights described in that certain ingress, egress and utilities easement and joint maintenance agreement recorded under King County Recording No. 9611011609 and attached hereto as Attachment 5, are hereby found and declared to be surplus to the City's needs and not required for water utility purposes.
