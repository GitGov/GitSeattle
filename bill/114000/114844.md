 ORDINANCE _________________

 AN ORDINANCE amending the 2004 Adopted Budget, including the 2004-2009 Capital Improvement Program (CIP), and 2004 City position list; changing appropriations to various departments and funds in the Budget; making cash transfers between various City funds and subfunds; and abrogating positions.

 WHEREAS, in November, 2003, the State Supreme Court ruled that the City of Seattle's practice of having the Light Fund pay for street lighting was unconstitutional and that these costs were the responsibility of the General Subfund; and

 WHEREAS, shifting the responsibility of street lighting to the General Subfund represented an impact on the 2004 General Subfund budget of $6.2 million for the annual cost of operating the City's street lights; and

 WHEREAS, the Mayor and City Council addressed a portion of the street lighting operating costs through the 2004 budget process, while the remainder was addressed with resources from the Emergency Subfund with the intention of revisiting the streetlight funding in the first quarter of 2004; and

 WHEREAS, to fully address the implications of the State Supreme Court's decision, the Mayor and City Council intend to have the General Subfund reimburse the Light Fund for the approximately $24 million spent on street lighting over the past four years; and

 WHEREAS, the Mayor and various City Councilmembers worked cooperatively to explore various options to address the streetlight funding issue, as well as prepare for upcoming 2005 budget pressures; and

 WHEREAS, this legislation modifies the 2004 Adopted Budget and restores the Emergency Subfund balance to its maximum allowable amount; and

 WHEREAS, the costs of incarcerating City prisoners in the King County Jail will be reduced by a variety of actions; and

 WHEREAS, the City Council and Mayor desire to allow appropriated funds to be used for a broader range of options for contracting for indigent defense services than stated in the 2004 Adopted Budget; NOW THEREFORE,

 BE IT ORDAINED BY THE CITY OF SEATTLE AS FOLLOWS:

 Section 1. The Mayor and City Council express their support and intentions as follows:

 1.1 Because the incarceration of lower-risk prisoners imposes significant costs on the General Subfund, the Mayor and City Council encourage the Municipal Court to expand the use of diversion programs where appropriate, consistent with judicial discretion.

 1.2 Because low collection rates have caused revenues from certain fines and forfeitures to fall below budget projections, the Mayor and City Council encourage the Municipal Court to improve its efficiency in collection processes and timelines.

 1.3 Although funding is maintained in 2004, the Mayor and City Council do not intend to continue funding for Abused Deaf Women's Advocacy Services and Neighborhood Business Council beyond 2004 and encourage these organizations to seek alternative funding.

 1.4 Although funding is maintained for Sharehouse in 2004, the Mayor and City Council express their intent to consider alternative means to provide surplus furniture to formerly homeless individuals, including possible cooperative programs with the Solid Waste Utility.

 1.5 Although funding is reduced for historic surveys by $31,000, the Mayor and City Council express their support for continuing such surveys in the future but at a slower pace.

 1.6 Although funding is eliminated for the Police Department's East Precinct Initiative, the Mayor has directed the Chief of Police to shift an additional Crime Prevention Coordinator to the East Precinct to work with businesses and community members, and also has directed the City to develop plans to enhance public safety throughout the East Precinct using existing resources.

 1.7 The City of Seattle continues to maintain a weights and measures program to promote a high level of consumer protection for City residents and businesses, but is restricted by State statute from fully recovering the costs of this program from fees. The Mayor and City Council express their intent to seek a change in State law to allow for the full recovery of the costs of weights and measures inspections.
