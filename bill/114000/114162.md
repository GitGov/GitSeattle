3.04.101 Definition

As used in this subchapter, "Director" shall mean the Director of Executive Administration.

~~3.38.802~~3.04.102 Compliance by City officers and employees--Exceptions.

 No city officer or employee shall have the authority to order or contract for the purchase of any supplies, materials, equipment, or service within the purview of this subchapter except through, or in accordance with rules and regulations prescribed by the Director ~~of Finance~~ and no order or contract made contrary to the provisions of the subchapter shall be approved by the Director ~~of Finance~~ or any subordinate thereof or be binding upon the City; provided, that contracts for services in connection with public works and construction, or by consultants pursuant to SMC Chapter 3.114, and all contracts for services in connection with the acquisition of real property and property rights, processing of claims and all litigation of the City or in which the City or any of its departments may be interested, shall be exempt from the requirements of this section.

~~3.38.806~~3.04.106 Competitive bidding--Cost over $30,000.

 A. Except in emergencies provided for in this subchapter, all expenditures for supplies, materials, equipment, and services within the purview of this subchapter the estimated cost of which is in excess of Thirty Thousand Dollars ($30,000) per requisition shall be made on written contract entered into upon the basis of competitive bids and are subject to the preferences provided by SMC Section ~~3.38.910~~3.04.210. Notices inviting sealed competitive bids shall be published at least once in the City official newspaper, and at least five (5) calendar days must intervene between the date of the last publication and the final date for submitting the bids; provided, that purchases of patented or proprietary items available from a single source, or purchases or contracts for services within the purview of this subchapter where competitive bidding is deemed impracticable by the Director ~~of Finance~~, shall be exempt from the competitive bidding requirements of the section; provided, further, that the purchase of supplies, materials, and equipment to be resold by the using agency may be negotiated for by the Director ~~of Finance~~ when, in his or her judgment, the lowest and best price can be obtained by such negotiation.

 B. All such bids shall be submitted sealed to the Director ~~or Finance~~ and shall be accompanied by surety in such form and amount as shall be prescribed by the Director ~~or Finance~~ in the notice inviting bids.

 C. The bids shall be opened in public at the time and place stated in the notice inviting bids. No bids will be considered which arrive at the place of bid opening at any time later than the time specified in the notice inviting bids. After examination and tabulation by the Director ~~of Finance~~, all bids may be inspected by the competing bidders. The Director ~~of Finance~~ may reject any or all bids, or part of bids, and shall state in writing and keep a record of the reason or reasons for such rejection, which record shall be open to public inspection. Otherwise the Director ~~of Finance~~ shall award the contract to the lowest and best bidder, or in the case of multiple awards to the lowest and best bidders. In determining the lowest and best bidder, the Director ~~of Finance~~ may consider such factors, among others, as quality, delivery terms, and service reputation of the vendor.

 D. An Invitation to Bid may specify that life cycle costing will be used either as the exclusive basis for evaluating bids or on an alternative basis. If sufficient life cycle cost information is readily available, the Director ~~of Finance~~ shall consider the life cycle cost in determining the lowest and best bid in accordance with the Invitation to Bid. "Life cycle cost" means the total cost to the City of the supplies, materials, or equipment procured over its estimated useful life, including costs of selection, acquisition, operation, maintenance, and where applicable, disposal as far as these costs can be reasonably determined, minus the salvage value at the end of its estimated useful life. The "estimated useful life" means the estimated time from the date of acquisition to the date of replacement or disposal, determined in a reasonable manner.

 E. When in the judgment of the Director ~~of Finance~~, bids require further information and analysis for the purpose of determining the lowest and best bidder, he/she may request that bidders provide pertinent information, and on receipt thereof may negotiate with one (1) or more bidders and award such contract to the lowest and best bidder as determined by such negotiation.

 F. When two (2) or more low bids received are for the same total amount or unit price, the Director ~~of Finance~~ may allow such tied bidders to offer a lower price or may make such purchase in the open market at a price not exceeding such bid price.

 G. The Director ~~of Finance~~ may require, before any contract is executed, that the successful bidder furnish a performance bond in such amount as said official shall find reasonable and necessary, which requirement shall be stated in the notice inviting bids. All surety bonds shall be subject to approval as to form by the City Attorney. If the successful bidder does not enter into a contract and file any required surety within ten (10) days after the award, such bidder shall forfeit the surety which accompanied its bid. A copy of each contract covering a term of three (3) months or more together with any required surety for performance thereof, shall be filed with the City Clerk.

 H. As authorized by RCW 39.30.040, for determining the lowest and best bidder, the Director ~~of Finance~~ shall take into consideration the tax revenues derived by the City from its business and occupation or utility taxes (Seattle Municipal Code Chapters 5.44 and 5.48) and its sales and use taxes (Seattle Municipal Code Chapter 5.60) from the proposed purchase.

~~3.38.808~~3.04.108 Zoo animals and specimens.

 The Director ~~of Finance~~ shall effect acquisition or disposal by sale, purchase, trade, exchange, or loan, of all zoo animals and other zoo specimens and where competitive bidding is deemed impracticable by the Director ~~of Finance~~, such acquisition or disposal shall be exempt from the competitive bidding requirements of this subchapter and the same may be effected by negotiated agreements by the Director ~~of Finance~~ in cooperation with the Superintendent of Parks and Recreation in accordance with such procedures as may be established by the Director ~~of Finance~~.

The Director or his or her designated representative may, in his or her discretion, determine the lowest and best bidder for expenditures under Thirty Thousand Dollars ($30,000) per requisition by the same criteria as used for larger purchases. When the Invitation to Bid so specifies, and if sufficient life cycle cost information is readily available, the Director ~~of Finance~~ shall consider the life cycle cost in determining the lowest and best bidder in accordance with the Invitation to Bid.

~~3.38.812~~3.04.112 Open market purchases where bidding is impractical.

 The Director ~~of Finance~~ or his or her designated representative may secure in the open market without bids any supplies, materials, equipment, or services within the purview of this subchapter, the cost of which will not exceed Five Thousand Dollars ($5,000) per item, when the delay and expense of handling bids on small purchases would not be advantageous to the City. The Director ~~of Finance~~ may delegate any or all of the powers in this section to other departments at his or her discretion.
