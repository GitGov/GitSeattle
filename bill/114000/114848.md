 AN ORDINANCE concerning the long-term agreement with the Yakima County Board of Commissioners for the provision of jail services for prisoners charged with or convicted of committing non-felony crimes in the Seattle Municipal Court, and amending Ordinance 120956 in connection therewith.

 WHEREAS, the City of Seattle ("City") pays for the confinement of individuals who are charged with or convicted of committing misdemeanor crimes in the Seattle Municipal Court; and

 WHEREAS, King County has implemented a new jail contract that reduces the number of beds available to city misdemeanants over the next ten years and eliminates those beds entirely as of 2013; and

 WHEREAS, the Yakima County Department of Corrections and Security ("Yakima County") has agreed to build sufficient jail capacity to house individuals who are charged with or convicted of committing misdemeanor crimes from outside its jurisdiction, and has guaranteed a minimum of 440 beds to the King County cities that are parties to this interlocal agreement; and

 WHEREAS, the City of Seattle has sent inmates to the Yakima County jail since July, 2002; and

 WHEREAS, a contract with Yakima County for jail services will not be a substitute for the City's continued investments in improving and expanding programs that offer alternatives to incarceration and alternative sentencing programs, including electronic home monitoring, work crew, community service, probation services and "problem solving" court calendars, such as the Mental Health Court and the Driving While License Suspended calendar; and

 WHEREAS, City Council Ordinance 120826, passed on June 17, 2002, directed the Executive to work to address any problems that arise during the pilot program and incorporate program improvements into any future long-term agreements with Yakima County; and

 WHEREAS, City Council Ordinance 120956, passed by the City Council on October 28, 2002, authorized the Executive to enter into a long term contract with the Yakima County Board of Commissioners for jail services; and

 WHEREAS, the Executive has worked with partners in Yakima County, the Seattle Municipal Court, Law Department, Police Department, City- contracted public defense agencies, local social service agencies, and Seattle inmates, to address and correct problems; and

 WHEREAS, the Executive and the Seattle Municipal Court have successfully reduced the average daily population of inmates housed at the King County Jail from approximately 400 inmates per day in 2001 to approximately 240 inmates per day during 2003, through the use of alternatives to incarceration and the transfer of inmates to Yakima; and

 WHEREAS, notwithstanding these efforts the average daily population of Seattle inmates in the King County Jail is anticipated to exceed that allowed in 2005 under Seattle's contract with King County; and

 WHEREAS, over two-thirds of the inmates held in the King County Jail on charges filed in the Seattle Municipal Court have not been convicted or sentenced; and

 WHEREAS, almost one-third of inmates held in the King County jail have been sentenced and convicted by the Seattle Municipal Court but are not transferred to Yakima because they are in Work Release, in the medical or psychiatric units, court-ordered to stay at the King County Jail, or their time left to serve is too short; and

 WHEREAS, in order to reduce the number of inmates held at the King County Jail, efforts need to focus on the pre-trial segment of the population; and

 WHEREAS, Yakima County required a minimum commitment of 155 jail beds from Seattle in order to enable Yakima to build sufficient capacity to house inmates from the King County cities and this contractual commitment began on October 1, 2003; and

 WHEREAS, the current daily population of inmates sentenced by the Seattle Municipal Court in the Yakima jail averages approximately 78 inmates; and

 WHEREAS, the Executive has successfully implemented a video visitation program which enables family, friends, probation workers and defense attorneys to visit via video with Seattle inmates housed at Yakima; and

 WHEREAS the Court has implemented another video visitation station in the Justice Center to enable increased use by probation staff, attorneys and other professional staff; and

 WHEREAS the City provides Seattle inmates housed at Yakima with a free and confidential telephone service for calls made to their defense attorneys; and

 WHEREAS the contract with Yakima County requires them to provide transportation for Seattle inmates between King County and Yakima 7 days a week at no additional cost to the City; and

 WHEREAS, in authorizing the Executive to enter into the aforementioned agreement, Ordinance 120956 limited the transfer of prisoners to inmates who have been both convicted and sentenced; NOW, THEREFORE,

 BE IT ORDAINED BY THE CITY OF SEATTLE AS FOLLOWS:

 Section 1. Section 1 of ordinance number 120956 is hereby amended to read as follows:

 Section 1. The Director of Finance is authorized to execute, for and on behalf of The City of Seattle, a long-term agreement and its addendum substantially in the form attached hereto with the Yakima County Board of County Commissioners for the provision of misdemeanant jail services entitled "INTERLOCAL AGREEMENT BETWEEN YAKIMA COUNTY, WASHINGTON AND THE CITIES OF ALGONA, AUBURN, TOWN OF BEAUX ARTS VILLAGE, BELLEVUE, BLACK DIAMOND, BOTHELL, BURIEN, CARNATION, CLYDE HILL, COVINGTON, DES MOINES, DUVALL, FEDERAL WAY, ISSAQUAH, KENMORE, KIRKLAND, LAKE FOREST PARK, MAPLE VALLEY, MEDINA, MERCER ISLAND, NEWCASTLE, NORMANDY PARK, NORTH BEND, PACIFIC, REDMOND, RENTON, SAMMAMISH, SEATAC, SEATTLE, SHORELINE, SKYKOMISH, SNOQUALMIE, TUKWILA, WOODINVILLE AND TOWN OF YARROW POINT, WASHINGTON" (Attachment 1) and its Addendum (Attachment 2)~~; provided, however, that no City of Seattle inmate shall be housed by Yakima County in Yakima County jail facilities pursuant to such agreement and addendum prior to conviction and sentencing unless such prisoner is a medical and/or psychiatric inmate who cannot be housed by King County in King County jail facilities because of jail capacity restrictions set forth in the Interlocal Agreement between King County and the City of Seattle for Jail Services~~provided, however, that sending pre-trial defendants to Yakima will only be used after consideration of other options. These options include but are not limited to electronic home monitoring, day reporting and reducing the time required for various steps in the case flow process. Further, in 2004, pre-trial defendants will only be sent if the City reaches 90% of the budgeted capacity at the King County Jail of 204 inmates, and in 2005, pre- trial defendants will only be sent if the City reaches 90% of the estimated contract capacity at the King County Jail of 150 inmates. The Executive will make every effort to identify ways to allow the expeditious sharing of documents between defense attorneys and their clients who are housed at Yakima.

 Section 2. The Executive is requested to report to the Public Safety, Civil Rights & Arts Committee by no later than April 30, 2005, on the effect of this ordinance.

 Section 3. The Executive shall produce a plan to reduce the number of Seattle prisoners in the King County jail. The plan shall describe all measures designed to reduce the number of Seattle prisoners in the King County jail that have been implemented, are planned for implementation or are under consideration; shall describe or predict the impact of each measure on the number of prisoners in the King County jail and the Yakima County jail; shall describe the feasibility and public safety implications of each measure; and shall estimate the impact of each measure on the cost of jail services. The Executive shall provide the plan to the Public Safety, Civil Rights & Arts Committee no later than April 30, 2004. The plan shall be updated every six months.

 Section 4. This ordinance shall take effect and be in force forty- five (45) days from and after its approval by the Mayor; but if within ten (10) days after its presentation to the Mayor it is returned to the City Council or the City Clerk without the Mayor's approval or disapproval, forty-five (45) days after its return; and if not approved and returned by the Mayor within ten (10) days after presentation sixty (60) days after passage by the City Council; and if disapproved by the Mayor and upon reconsideration again passed by the City Council, forty-five (45) days after such reconsidered passage.
