 02/13/02 (Ver. 1 ) t Exhibit A FIRST AMENDMENT TO COOPERATION AGREEMENT

 THIS FIRST AMENDMENT TO COOPERATION AGREEMENT (this "First Amendment") is made as of ____________________ by and between THE CITY OF SEATTLE (the "City"), a Washington municipal corporation, and the MUSEUM DEVELOPMENT AUTHORITY OF SEATTLE (the "Authority"), a Washington public authority chartered by the City, and amends that certain cooperation agreement effective as of October 1, 1994 (the "Cooperation Agreement") with respect to certain rights and responsibilities of the City and the Authority relating to the Authority's Revenue Refunding Bonds, Series 1994.

 I. RECITALS

 These facts and principles form the background of this First Amendment.

 1. On May 25, 2001, the City purchased real property located at 10 Broad Street in downtown Seattle (the "10 Broad Street Property") for parks and open space purposes to be used as part of the Seattle Art Museum's (the "Museum") new Olympic Sculpture Park (the "OSP").

 2. The City intends to transfer the 10 Broad Street Property to the Authority so that the Authority may undertake, assist with and otherwise facilitate the development of the 10 Broad Street Property for inclusion in the OSP consistent with the City's interlocal cooperation agreement with King County for use of conservation future levy proceeds for open space acquisition projects. The City Council, pursuant to Ordinance 120681, has authorized the Superintendent of Parks and Recreation to enter into a property transfer agreement with the Authority contingent upon the City's receipt of a written legal opinion addressed to the City from the Authority's Bond Counsel and satisfactory to the Director of Finance, and contingent upon City Council approval of this First Amendment. The form of the property transfer agreement, including the deed to the Authority, is attached to Ordinance 120681.

 3. The Authority intends to lease the 10 Broad Street Property to the Museum, as authorized by Authority Resolution ___________ (the "10 Broad Street Ground Lease"). The 10 Broad Street Ground Lease provides that the Authority will perform certain demolition and environmental work on the 10 Broad Street Property (the "MDA Work"), which the Museum will manage and supervise for the Authority. The 10 Broad Street Ground Lease also provides that the Museum will make certain lump sum payments to the Authority as rent (the "10 Broad Street Rent"), which are intended to be at least sufficient to pay for the MDA Work. The 10 Broad Street Ground Lease anticipates that the Authority will receive funds, in addition to the 10 Broad Street Rent, for the MDA Work or development of the 10 Broad Street Property, including without limitation grants and donations from individuals, entities, regulatory agencies and other funders (the "10 Broad Street Grant Funds"). The 10 Broad Street Rent and the 10 Broad Street Grant Funds shall hereinafter be referred to collectively as the "10 Broad Street Revenues".

 4. The Authority and the City recognize that 10 Broad Street Revenues may constitute "Revenues" as defined in the Authority's Bond Resolution and the Cooperation Agreement. As such, the Authority and the City recognize that the 10 Broad Street Rent and the 10 Broad Street Grant Funds must be deposited in the General Fund of the Authority, which was created pursuant to Section 9 of the Authority's Bond Resolution and Section 4.3 of the Cooperation Agreement. The Authority and the City further recognize that, so long as the Authority's 1994 Bonds are outstanding, money in the Authority's General Fund must be used only for the purposes and in the order of priority set forth in Section 9 of the Bond Resolution and Section 4.3 of the Cooperation Agreement.

 5. Section 4.3 of the Cooperation Agreement currently limits the use of Revenues to pay operational expenses of the Authority to an annual amount, as determined by the Authority and the Museum, not to exceed $100,000.

 6. The Authority expects that its expenses related to the 10 Broad Street Property will exceed $100,000 annually for certain years during the term of the Cooperation Agreement. The Authority's expenses related to the 10 Broad Street Property will include the cost of the MDA Work and the cost of administering the 10 Broad Street Ground Lease (the "10 Broad Street Expenses"). Under the 10 Broad Street Ground Lease, the Authority's expenses may also include some of the costs of developing the 10 Broad Street Property for inclusion in the OSP (the "OSP Expenses") if sufficient 10 Broad Street Revenues are available.

 7. The acquisition and development of the 10 Broad Street Property for the OSP constitute a public purpose for which public funds may properly be expended or advanced.

 8. The Authority and the City wish to amend the Cooperation Agreement to provide for payment of the 10 Broad Street Expenses and the OSP Expenses.
