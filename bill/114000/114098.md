Continuing Disclosure.

 A. Disclosure. This Article constitutes the written undertaking (the "Undertaking") for the benefit of the holders of the Refunding Bonds as required by paragraph (b)(5) of United States Securities and Exchange Commission (the "SEC") Rule 15c2-12 (the "Rule"). For purposes of this Undertaking, the term "holders of the Refunding Bonds" shall have the meaning intended for such term under the Rule. The City as an "obligated person" within the meaning of the Rule undertakes to provide or cause to be provided, either directly or through a designated agent:

 (1) To each nationally recognized municipal securities information repository designated by the SEC in accordance with the Rule (each "NRMSIR"), and to a state information depository, if one is established in the State of Washington and recognized by the SEC (the "SID"), annual financial information and operating data regarding the City of the type included, or incorporated by reference, in the Official Statement for the Refunding Bonds as follows: (i) annual financial statements of the City, prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles applicable to governmental units (except as otherwise noted therein), as such principles may be changed from time to time and as permitted by State law, which statements will not be audited, except that if and when audited financial statements are otherwise prepared and available to the City they will be provided; (ii) a statement of authorized, issued and outstanding general obligation debt of the City; (iii) the assessed value of the property within the City subject to ad valorem taxation; and (iv) ad valorem tax levy rates and amounts and percentage of taxes collected.

 Annual financial information, as described above, will be provided to each NRMSIR and the SID not later than the last day of the ninth month after the end of each fiscal year of the City (currently, a fiscal year ending December 31), as such fiscal year may be changed as permitted or required by State law, commencing with the City's fiscal year ending December 31, 2002. The annual financial information maybe provided in a single or in multiple documents, and may be incorporated by reference from other documents, including official statements of debt issues with respect to which the City is an obligated person as defined by the Rule, which documents have been filed with each NRMSIR and the SID. If the document incorporated by reference is a "final official statement" (as defined by the Rule) with respect to which the City is an obligated person, it must be available from the Municipal Securities Rulemaking Board ("MSRB"). The City will clearly identify each such other document so incorporated by reference.

 (2) To each NRMSIR or to the MSRB, and to the SID, timely notice of a failure by the City to provide required annual financial information on or before the date specified in paragraph A(1) above.

 B. Amendment. This Undertaking may be amended without the consent of any owner of any Refunding Bond, any broker, dealer, municipal securities dealer, participating underwriter, rating agency, NRMSIR, the SID or the MSRB, under the circumstances and in the manner permitted by the Rule. The City will give notice to each NRMSIR or the MSRB, and the SID, of the substance (or provide a copy) of any amendment to the Undertaking and a brief statement of the reasons for the amendment. If the amendment changes the type of annual financial information to be provided, the annual financial information containing the amended information will include a narrative explanation of the effect of that change on the type of information to be provided.

 C. Compliance. If the City fails to comply with this Undertaking, the City will proceed with due diligence to cause such noncompliance to be corrected as soon as practicable after the City learns of that failure. No failure by the City or other obligated person to comply with this Undertaking shall constitute a default with respect to the Refunding Bonds. The sole remedy of the Commission and of any holder of a Refunding Bond will be to take such actions as the Commission or that holder deems necessary and appropriate to compel the City or other obligated person to comply with this Undertaking.

 D. Beneficiaries. This Undertaking shall inure to the benefit of the City, the Authority and any holder of the Refunding Bonds, and shall not inure to the benefit of or create any rights in any other person.

 E. Termination. The City's obligations under the Undertaking described in this Article shall terminate upon the legal defeasance, prior redemption or payment in full of the then outstanding Refunding Bonds. In addition, the Undertaking, or any provision thereof, will be null and void if the City (i) obtains an opinion of nationally recognized bond counsel or other counsel familiar with federal securities laws to the effect that those portions of the Rule which require the City to comply with the Undertaking, or any such provision, are invalid, have been repealed retroactively or otherwise do not apply to the Bonds; and (ii) notifies the SID and either the MSRB or each NRMSIR of such termination.

 F. Notification to Authority. The City shall make reasonable efforts to provide to the Authority any notice that the City makes under 17 C.F.R. Section 240.15c2-12(b)(5)(i)(C)-(6) and (11),  provided that the City's failure to provide such notice to the Authority shall not result in any responsibility or liability whatsoever to the Authority or any other person or entity, and shall not affect or change in any way the rights, duties and responsibilities of the City or the Authority under this Agreement. This Paragraph (F) of Article _____ does not constitute a part of the City's Undertaking for the benefit of the holders of the Refunding Bonds.

Section 5. All other terms and conditions of the Agreement are hereby ratified and confirmed.

Section 6. This Third Amendment shall be effective as of the date first written above upon execution by the Mayor and the chairman of the Council of the Commission.

 IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the City and the Commission have executed this Third Amendment on the respective dates set forth below.
