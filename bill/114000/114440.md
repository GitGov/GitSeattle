 ORDINANCE __________

 AN ORDINANCE establishing a City Light Advisory Board and establishing a stipend to be paid to Board members.

 WHEREAS, Seattle City Light has recently experienced a period of exceptional volatility caused by restructuring of the wholesale electric energy market and subsequent market manipulation in California combined with drought in the Pacific Northwest, that together with other factors have created substantial new financial and management challenges for the utility; and

 WHEREAS, the City Council, the Mayor and City Light Superintendent recognize that the complex and dynamic nature of the electric utility industry requires additional expertise to inform and advise them in the areas of power supply and marketing, financial and risk management, and electrical policy issues and business strategies; and

 WHEREAS, the Mayor's appointed City Light Review Committee in its report, "Seattle City Light: Protecting the Jewel in the City's Crown," recommends the creation of an independent City Light Advisory Board; Now, Therefore,

 BE IT ORDAINED BY THE CITY COUNCIL OF THE CITY OF SEATTLE, THE MAYOR CONCURRING:

 Section 1. Establishment of a City Light Advisory Board

 A City Light Advisory Board is hereby established consisting of six (6) members with three (3) members appointed by the Council and three (3) members appointed by the Mayor. The Mayor shall appoint the Chair from one of the three mayoral appointments. Members shall be appointed for term ending on January 31 of 2006. Members shall be subject to removal by the appointing authority for cause. If, for any reason, a member does not serve his or her full term, the appointing authority will appoint a new member to complete the remainder of that term.

 The Advisory Board may adopt rules for its own procedures, including quorum requirements and the frequency of meetings. All Advisory Board meetings shall be open to the public unless, had the Advisory Board been subject to Chapter 42.30 RCW, that law would not have required the meeting or portion of the meeting to be open to the public.

 Advisory Board members should have demonstrated expertise and experience in one or more of the following areas: business, finances, energy conservation, environmental protection, energy law, utility operations, and power/risk management. The composition of the Board is intended to provide expert input.

 The Advisory Board shall advise the Mayor, the City Council, and the City Light Superintendent on policies, business strategies, and performance oversight related to the utility's finances, power supply, power marketing, risk management, environmental protection, energy conservation, and other areas as deemed appropriate by the Mayor and Council. The Advisory Board shall develop its annual scope of work in consultation with the Mayor, Council and City Light Superintendent.

 The Advisory Board will deliver an annual written report to the City Council, the Mayor and the Superintendent of City Light by January 31 of the following year. This report will summarize the activities, recommendations and expenses of the Board for the previous calendar year.

 After receiving the third annual report, the Mayor and City Council shall review and assess the efficacy of the Board and determine whether the Advisory Board should be continued, and if so, whether changes should be made to its structure or responsibilities.

 Section 2. Consideration of Advisory Board Recommendations

 The Mayor, City Council, and Superintendent shall give every serious consideration to all written recommendations of the advisory board. Both majority recommendations and minority opinions will be given such consideration. If the Superintendent, Mayor, or Council act upon an issue that has been the subject of a written board recommendation, the Superintendent, Mayor, or the Chair of the Council's Energy and Environmental Policy Committee, or its functional successor committee, shall, respectively, provide a clear written response to the board in a timely manner.

 Section 3. Payment Of Stipend To Board Members

 Board members shall be paid a stipend of $500 per meeting. In no case; however, shall the stipend paid to any member exceed $1,500 per calendar month, regardless of the number of meetings attended by that member in the month. In 2003, funding for the stipend will be provided from existing appropriations in City Light's Executive Budget Control Level. The Mayor shall include necessary funding for this purpose in the budgets he proposes for City Light for 2004 and 2005.

 Section 4. Compliance With Code of Ethics

 Advisory Board members shall comply with the Seattle Code of Ethics (SMC Chapter 4.16).
