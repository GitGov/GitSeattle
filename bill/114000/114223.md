 THIS PROPERTY USE AND DEVELOPMENT AGREEMENT (the "Agreement") is executed this _____ day of ______, 2002, in favor of the CITY OF SEATTLE (the "City"), a Washington municipal corporation, by PIERRE PROPERTIES, LLC ("Pierre"), owner of Lots 1 through 9, Block 16, Homewood Park.

 R E C I T A L S:

 Pierre owns a fee simple and/or substantial beneficial interest in the following described property (herein called the "Property"): Lots 1 through 9, Block 16, Homewood Park according to the plat recorded in Vol. 22 of Plats, page 73, of the Records of King County together with that portion of the vacated alley lying within said block which would attach thereto by operation of law.

 On June 30, 2000, Pierre submitted to the City of Seattle an application for a contract rezone of the Property from Single Family 7200 to Commercial 1 pursuant to the provisions of the Land Use Code. The purpose of the application is to allow the Property to be used for storage of automobile inventory.

 Seattle Municipal Code (SMC) Section 23.34.004 allows the City to approve a contract rezone subject to "self-imposed restrictions upon the use and development of the property in order to ameliorate adverse impacts which could occur from unrestricted use and development permitted in the zone."

 Pierre now desires that the rezone petition be granted with the limitations and conditions recommended by the Council's Land Use Committee.

 AGREEMENT

 Pierre hereby covenants, bargains and agrees on behalf of itself and its successors and assigns that they will comply with the following limitations and conditions in consideration of the rezone of the Property from Single Family 7200 (SF 7200) to Commercial 1/30'

 1. Existing Residences. At a minimum, Pierre will preserve and maintain two of the four existing residential structures, within the Property -located at 2605-NE 117th Street and 11560-26th Avenue NE.

 2. Use Restrictions. Activities and uses within the Rezone Area will be restricted in the following manner.

 a. Non-residential use of the Rezone Area will be limited to accessory storage of vehicle inventory. No structures, other than fences or walls not to exceed six feet or light standards not to exceed 20 feet, will be constructed.

 b. Only single family uses shall be allowed for the preserved residential structures.

 c. Use of the Property for non-residential purposes will be limited to that portion of the Rezone Area generally depicted as the "Vehicle Storage Area" in ATTACHMENT A attached hereto.

 3. Access. There will be no vehicular access to the Vehicle Storage Area from 26th Avenue NE. Access from NE 117th Street will be minimized as much as possible, and in any event limited to between the hours of 8:00 a.m. and 6:00 p.m. Monday through Friday. It is anticipated that access from NE 117th Street will occur a maximum of two times per month, for 30 minutes per occasion. At no time will car carriers be allowed access to the Vehicle Storage Area.

 4. Landscaping. As generally depicted in landscaping plans to be approved by the City, Pierre will establish and maintain a twenty-foot wide landscape buffer along the north and west sides of the Vehicle Storage Area, except that the width of the vegetative buffer to the side and rear of the houses will be five feet, with a minimum of five feet between any structure and the side-yard landscaping, and a minimum of ten feet between any structure and rear-yard landscaping. A fence of no greater than six feet in height will be located inside and immediately east of the landscape buffer.

 a. The proposed vegetative buffer must separate the existing residential structures from the proposed vehicle storage area. The buffer must be densely planted with trees and shrubs to completely screen the accessory vehicle storage from the street view and from the residential uses within the rezone area. The landscaping must be in place prior to the commencement of the accessory storage use. The required landscaping plan shall be subject to review and approval by DCLU.

 5. Sidewalks. Pierre will make all street improvements required by SMC 23.52.015(C), including the establishment of a five-foot sidewalk around the perimeter of the Property along 26th Avenue NE and NE 117th Street.

 a. The sidewalk improvements must be constructed prior to the commencement of the accessory storage use.

 6. Signage and Banners. No signs, banners, balloons, or inflated symbols or advertising of any kind will be allowed in the Property.

 7. Parking. No employee parking, customer parking, or automobile storage will be allowed along those portions of 26th Avenue NE and NE 117th Street that are adjacent to the Property.

 8. Loudspeakers. No loudspeakers or other sound amplification devices will be allowed in the Property.

 9. Lighting. The height of lighting poles and fixtures within the Property will be restricted to 20 feet. Pierre will use "shoe-box" fixtures to ensure that lighting will be shielded and directed downward to minimize glare to adjacent streets and neighbors.

 10. Dumpsters. No dumpsters will be placed in the Rezone Area.

 Agreement Runs With the Land. This Property Use and Development Agreement (hereinafter "Agreement") shall be recorded in the records of King County by the City Clerk. The covenants hereof shall be deemed to attach to and run with the Property and shall be binding upon Pierre, its heirs, successors and assigns, and shall apply to after-acquired title of the Owner of the Property.

 Termination. The covenants herein and the rezone shall expire and be of no force and effect two years from the effective date of the approval of this rezone if Owner fails to satisfy the requirement of Section 23.76.060.B.1a of the Seattle Municipal Code.

 Amendment. This Agreement may be amended or modified by agreement between Owners and the City; provided, such amendment agreement shall be approved by the legislative authority of the City by ordinance.

 Exercise of Police Power. Nothing in this Agreement shall prevent the City Council from making such further amendments to the Seattle Municipal Code or Land Use Code as it may deem necessary in the public interest.

 No Precedent. The conditions contained in this Agreement are based on the unique circumstances applicable to this Property and this Agreement is not intended to establish precedent for other rezones in the surrounding area.

 Benefited. This Agreement is made for the benefit of the City and for the benefit of the owners of property within 300 feet of the Property and either the City or any such property owners may institute and prosecute any proceeding at law or in equity to enforce this Agreement.

 Repeal as Additional Remedy. Owner acknowledges that compliance with the conditions of this Agreement is a condition of the subject rezone and that if Owner avails itself of the benefits of this rezone but then fail to comply with the conditions of this Agreement with the City, in addition to pursuing any other remedy, the City may revoke the rezone by ordinance and require the use of the Property to conform to the requirements of the Single Family 7200 (SF7200) zone.
