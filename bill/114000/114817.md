 WHEREAS, SHA filed a petition (C. F. 305070) for the vacation of the above-referenced streets and alleys pursuant to Chapter 35.79 of the Revised Code of Washington and Seattle Municipal Code Chapter 15.62; and

 WHEREAS, the High Point Committee of the Whole of the Seattle City Council held a public hearing on the street vacation petition on April 29, 2003; and

 WHEREAS, the High Point Committee of the Whole of the Seattle City Council subsequently discussed the project in a public meeting; and

 WHEREAS, the High Point Committee of the Whole of the Seattle City Council recommended approval of the street vacation petition, subject to conditions on May 19, 2003; and

 WHEREAS, the Seattle City Council granted approval of the street vacation petition, subject to conditions on May 27, 2003; and

 WHEREAS, execution of a Property Use and Development Agreement is desired to ensure compliance with any conditions of street vacation approval that will not be fully satisfied prior to passage of the ordinance vacating the above-referenced streets and alleys; and ;

 NOW, THEREFORE, SHA hereby covenants, bargains and agrees on behalf of itself, its successors and assigns, that if the ordinance vacating the above-referenced streets and alleys is passed by the Seattle City Council and approved by the Mayor, SHA shall operate and maintain the Plat of High Point Community in accordance with this Property Use and Development Agreement:

 Section 1. Addressed below are those conditions of the street vacation approval that require on-going effort during the construction and operation of the Plat of High Point Community, and could not, therefore, be met prior to passage of the ordinance vacating the above-referenced streets and alleys.

 A. Substantial Conformance: The development of the Plat of High Point Community shall be substantially in conformance with the project presented to the City Council Committee of the Whole in April of 2003.

 B. Street Improvements: All street improvements shall be designed in conformity with the agreement related to the Natural Drainage System and shall be reviewed and approved by Seattle Transportation ("SDOT"). It is anticipated that a formal agreement shall be developed that will specify street and right-of-way widths, drainage system options and locations, porous paving options, a plan for evaluation of the system, commitments relating to repair, maintenance, and replacement. Such agreement shall guide the street improvement plan. In addition to the elements addressed in the initial agreement, SHA shall provide a drainage basin plan report with the Street Improvement Plan that:

 * Delineates public and private drainage requirements, through design guidelines;

 * Establishes how water quality treatment of the 6-month, 24-hour storm event and flow attenuation of the 2-year storm event is achieved through natural system technology and design standards; and

 * Delineates maintenance responsibilities for the drainage system in the public right-of-way.

 Finally, SHA and SPU shall, prior to final City approval of the High Point Street Improvement Plan, enter into a Memorandum of Agreement that governs maintenance of the Natural Drainage System detention/retention pond to be located on Block 4, Tract 4A of the Plat of High Point Community.

 C. Schedule and Quarterly Reports: In order to insure compliance with the conditions imposed by the City Council, SHA shall provide SDOT with quarterly reports, commencing following Council approval of the vacation, providing an update on the development activity and schedule and the progress on meeting the conditions. Along with the quarterly reports, SHA shall provide the Department of Planning and Development (DPD) (copy to SDOT), a status report on the amount of impervious surface coverage on each parent lot within the Plat of High Point Community, indicating whether the allowable impervious surface coverage percentage established by sheet 23b of the Final Plat for the parent lot has been reached, or if not, how much of the allowable percentage remains.

 D. 34th Avenue SW. A final determination as to whether 34th Avenue SW (between SW Raymond Street and SW Graham Street) shall be dedicated as a public street shall be made by DPD and SDOT after SHA has completed its planning and design work for Block 9 of the Plat of High Point Community. In the event 34th Avenue SW is not dedicated as a public street, the petitioner shall ensure that no incremental development occurs on Block 9 that results in the creation of an access easement that appears and operates in a manner similar to a public street. Any access easement or easements created in connection with development of Block 9 shall be designed and constructed to provide clear notice to the public that they are not continuations of the public 34th Avenue SW right of way; shall not be in alignment with 34th Avenue SW; and may not provide through-block access between SW Raymond St and SW Graham Street. Petitioner acknowledges that the existing access easement that abuts Parent Lot 9-1 and serves the adjacent Parcels A and B shall not be available to serve development on Parent Lots 9-1 through 9-8. Petitioner also acknowledges that DPD and SDOT have the authority to require the dedication of 34th Avenue SW (between SW Raymond Street and SW Graham Street) as a public street, and that DPD and SDOT intend to require dedication as a public street if the proposed development of Block 9 follows a standard development pattern that results in a determination by DPD and SDOT that a public street is necessary to protect the public interest.

 E. Park/Community Center Block. SW Park Street, now SW Eddy Street, shall not continue through the Park/community center block. No through street connection shall be permitted on the Park/community center block between 31st Avenue SW and Sylvan Way. Access to the park and community facilities shall be via a driveway that does not connect to both 31st Avenue SW and Sylvan Way.

 Section 2. The legal description of the property upon which the High Point Community is located (the "Property") is included in Exhibit 1 hereto, which is incorporated herein by this reference. An executed copy of this Property Use and Development Agreement shall be recorded in the records of King County and the covenants hereof shall be deemed to attach to and run with the Property.

 Section 3. This Property Use and Development Agreement may be amended or modified by mutual agreement between the City and SHA, according to the following procedure. Minor changes to this Agreement may be approved by SDOT (and by SPU as to the Natural Drainage System), if the proposed change is consistent with the purpose and intent of the conditions. Any major changes to this Agreement, as determined by SDOT (and by SPU as to the Natural Drainage System), shall require approval by the City Council of the City by resolution or ordinance. SDOT and SPU shall provide SHA with notice and the opportunity to comment on whether a change is considered minor or major, prior to SDOT or SPU making that determination. Nothing in this Property Use and Development Agreement shall be construed as a surrender of the City's governmental powers.

 Section 4. This Property Use and Development Agreement is made for the benefit of the City and the public. The City may institute and prosecute any proceeding law or in equity to enforce this Property Use and Development Agreement.

 Section 5. It is further expressly agreed that in the event any covenant or condition or restriction in this instrument or any portion thereof is invalid or void, such invalidity or voidness shall in no way affect any other covenant, condition or restriction.
