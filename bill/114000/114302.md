 ORDINANCE ______________

 AN ORDINANCE relating to land use and zoning, correcting a clerical error in Ordinance 120842 by substituting a correct Exhibit A to replace an incorrect map that was mistakenly attached to that ordinance.

 WHEREAS, on July 1, 2002 the Seattle City Council passed Ordinance 120842 adopting a new Major Institutions Master Plan for Seattle Central Community College (SCCC) under the major institutions provisions of the Seattle Land Use Code and amending the Official Land Use Map, Seattle Municipal Code 23.32.016, Page 111, Plat 1, (or Volume 1 of Plats, Page(s) 153, Records of King County, Washington) to modify the SCCC Major Institutions Overlay District boundary adding a MIO-65 designation, and to modify height limits and to rezone property within the existing boundary, all generally located along Broadway and East Pine Street (Petition of Seattle Central Community College, C.F. 302336 App. 9705705);and

 WHEREAS, Ordinance 120842 was signed by the Mayor on July 9, 2002; and

 WHEREAS, Ordinance 120842, Section 2, amended the Official Land Use Map, Page 111, as last amended by Ordinance 112265, to rezone certain property from Neighborhood Commercial 3 with a 65 foot height limit (NC3-65) to NC3-65 with a Major Institution Overlay with a 65 foot height limit (NC3 65/MIO-65); and

 WHEREAS, Ordinance 120842, Section 3, amended the Official Land Use Map, Page 111, as last amended by Ordinance 112265, to rezone certain property from Neighborhood Commercial 3 with a 65 foot height limit with a Major Institution Overlay with a 105 foot height limit (NC3 65/MIO-105) to NC3-65 with a Major Institution Overlay with a 65 foot height limit (NC3 65/MIO-65); and

 WHEREAS, Ordinance 120842, Sections 2 and 3, each contain legal description of the properties being rezoned as well as the statement that the rezoned properties are "shown in Exhibit A attached to this Ordinance"; and

 WHEREAS, due to a clerical error an incorrect version of Exhibit A was mistakenly attached to Ordinance 120842 prior to its transmittal to the City Clerk; and

 WHEREAS, the legislative history regarding the adoption of the new Major Institutions Master Plan for Seattle Central Community College (SCCC) and the associated rezones shows that Exhibit A was intended to depict the properties to be rezoned in accordance with the legal descriptions included in Ordinance 120842, Sections 2 and 3,

 NOW THEREFORE,

 BE IT ORDAINED BY THE CITY OF SEATTLE AS FOLLOWS:

 Section 1. The map labeled "Corrected Exhibit A - Approved Zoning" and attached to this corrective ordinance is hereby substituted for Exhibit "A" that was attached to Ordinance 120842 in order to properly depict the property rezoned by that ordinance consistent with the legal descriptions contained therein and the intent of the Council.

 Section 2. The purpose of this ordinance is to correct an inadvertent clerical error and not to establish new substantive standards or new zoning.
