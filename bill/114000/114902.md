 SECTION 2. GRANT OF RIGHTS BY THE CITY

 2.1 Grant of Non-Exclusive Use of A Monorail Transit Way. The City grants to SMP a non-exclusive use of portions of certain Public Rights-of-Way, the general location of which is described in the Alignment Approval, to be known as a Monorail Transit Way, to construct, operate, maintain, and own a Monorail Transit System in accordance with the terms and conditions of this Agreement. The Monorail Transit Way shall be consistent with the Alignment Approval and more fully described in the Final Construction Plans and Record Drawings. This grant shall take effect upon the filing with the City Clerk by the Director of Transportation or Director of Planning and Development of approved Final Construction Plans; provided that the Final Construction Plans shall be replaced with Record Drawings, which may contain City-approved modifications from the approved Final Construction Plans. When the Record Drawings are filed with the City Clerk by the Director of Transportation or the Director of Planning and Development, the Monorail Transit Way shall be deemed to be modified in conformance with the Record Drawings. SMP expressly agrees that it will construct, operate and maintain the Monorail Transit System in compliance with this Agreement, including the conditions described in Exhibit C, and all applicable City ordinances, state and federal laws. SMP also expressly agrees that, except as set forth in this Agreement and other permits and approvals granted by the City for the construction and operation of the monorail, nothing in this Agreement is intended or shall be interpreted to limit the rights of the City to permit utilities and owners of Private Utility Connections to operate, maintain, repair, replace or add to their facilities within the Monorail Transit Way. Non-City-owned utilities will be responsible for the reasonable costs to move or replace any Monorail Transit Facilities if such action is required by their operation, maintenance, repair, replacement or addition to their facilities within the Monorail Transit Way. Nothing in this Agreement limits the City's ability to impose reasonable conditions on land use and street use permits, consistent with the City's policies and authority under the State Environmental Policy Act (SEPA) and consistent with Seattle Municipal Code provisions, including those pertaining to review and approval of Monorail Transit Facilities, Section 15.54.020 and Chapter 23.80, Essential Public Facilities. The City's exercise of SEPA authority shall not require an amendment to this Agreement.

 2.2 Rights Limited to Monorail Transit System. The non-exclusive use of a Monorail Transit Way is granted solely for the purpose of construction, maintenance, operation, and ownership of the Monorail Transit System detailed in the Final Construction Plans, and for no other purpose. SMP intends, and shall have the right, to use the Monorail Transit Way solely for Monorail Transit System uses. SMP agrees that it shall not, without the City's prior written consent, (a) construct on or along the Monorail Transit Way any additions to or expansions of the Monorail Transit System subsequent to the construction done in accordance with the Final Construction Plans as approved by the City or (b) operate, repair, maintain, replace or add to Monorail Transit Facilities. Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing contained herein shall prevent SMP from conducting Routine Maintenance and Operations of any Monorail Transit Facilities or equipment after initial construction. For purposes of this paragraph, the City's "consent" refers to the approval of the Director of Transportation or the Director of Planning and Development, as applicable, which consent shall not be given without plan review and approval by the Director of Seattle Public Utilities, Superintendent of Seattle City Light or Director of Seattle Center, as applicable.

 2.3 Non-Exclusive Use. SMP understands that the rights granted herein are non-exclusive. The City shall have the right to agree to other non-exclusive uses or occupancies of the Monorail Transit Way. The City agrees that such uses or occupancies shall not unreasonably impair the ability of SMP to operate the Monorail Transit System.

 2.4 Use Restricted. This Agreement does not authorize the provision of any services by the SMP other than the services strictly related to the operation of the Monorail Transit System. SMP's use of the Monorail Transit Way for anything other than a Monorail Transit System shall require written permits or other approvals from the City. SMP shall not place any advertising on the Monorail Guideway except to the extent authorized by Seattle Municipal Code Chapter 23.55 (Sign Code) and Title 15 (Street and Sidewalk Use).

 2.5 Ownership. SMP shall own all Monorail Transit Facilities on the Monorail Transit Way, except for improvements expressly transferred to the City. Nothing in this Agreement shall be construed as granting to SMP any interest or right in the Monorail Transit Way other than the rights expressly provided herein.

 2.6 No Rights by Implication. No rights shall pass to SMP by implication. Without limiting the foregoing, by way of example and not limitation, this Agreement shall not include or be a substitute for:

 A. Any other permit or authorization required for the privilege of transacting and carrying on a business within the City that may be required by the ordinances and laws of the City; or

 B. Any permit or agreement for occupying any other property of the City or other public or private entities to which access is not specifically granted by this Agreement.

 2.7 Delegation to DBOM Contractor. Completion of design and construction of the Monorail Transit System, and operation and maintenance thereof following Substantial Completion thereof, will be the responsibility of SMP's DBOM Contractor. Accordingly, many of the rights, responsibilities and duties of SMP hereunder will be undertaken and accomplished by the DBOM Contractor. The parties agree that the SMP shall have the right to delegate duties hereunder to the DBOM Contractor and the DBOM Contractor shall have the rights of entry onto, access to, and use and occupancy of the Monorail Transit Facilities for the purpose of carrying out such duties and all other duties the DBOM Contractor undertakes pursuant to agreements with the SMP. The City recognizes the DBOM contractor as the independent contractor of the SMP for the purposes of this Agreement and the City will permit the performance of the DBOM Contractor's duties. SMP agrees that it will provide the DBOM Contractor with a copy of this Agreement and will require compliance with this Agreement by the DBOM Contractor. Nothing contained herein relieves SMP of the ultimate responsibility for complying with all terms of this Agreement. The City and SMP agree that the City is an intended third-party beneficiary of SMP's contract with the DBOM Contractor wherever that contract is related to City-required improvements, repairs, or restoration of the Public Rights-of-Way, City-owned utilities, other City capital facilities or assets, and Private Utility Connections.

 SECTION 3. DESIGN & CONSTRUCTION APPROVALS

 3.1 Approval of Design and Construction

 It is the City's intent:

 a) That design excellence throughout the Monorail system shall emphasize designs that are graceful and slender in appearance, and in scale with the surrounding neighborhood for the guideway, columns, and other system elements;

 b) That City approvals and other actions are performed in a cost effective and time-certain manner; and

 c) That Project completion is not unduly or unreasonably delayed by City permitting or other actions.

 3.1.1 Approvals Required Prior to Construction.

 A. Neither the Department of Planning and Development nor the Seattle Department of Transportation shall issue any Project Construction Permit until the City Council, after consideration of SMP's financial submittal described in this subsection 3.1.1 A, has voted by resolution to allow such issuance. The City Council has by resolution set forth the financial factors it intends to consider in determining whether to allow issuance of Project Construction Permits. The SMP shall provide in writing to the Council the following (collectively "SMP's financial submittal"): a list, explanation, and schedule of SMP's anticipated revenues and costs for construction and operations; SMP's plan for financing construction and operations, including the schedule for debt issuance, projected debt terms, and interest rate assumptions; a copy of the then-most-current draft or final version of SMP's annual financial report required by RCW 43.09.230; a copy of the then-most-current version of all financial statements drafted since the last annual financial report required by RCW 43.09.230; all materials submitted to rating agencies and/or potential credit enhancers, including a synopsis of major oral presentations made; SMP's Request for Proposals to Design, Build, Operate, Maintain the Green Line; copies of all reports by rating agencies; the finalized Design Build Equip Contract (DBEC) and Operations and Maintenance Contract (OMC) that the SMP Executive Director recommends to the SMP Board for approval (or the approved contracts if the SMP Board has approved them) that are not proprietary or otherwise required by law to remain confidential; and any other financial materials considered by SMP in its financial planning. The Council, or its designee, shall determine whether and when SMP has made a complete submittal. The Council's consideration of SMP's financial submittal and any vote to allow issuance of Project Construction Permits are solely internal City actions. The City shall have no liability whatsoever to SMP, its agents, potential credit enhancers, or purchasers of SMP debt, or to any other third parties, with respect to any aspect of such consideration or vote, including without limitation the content of or the Council's conclusions about SMP's financial submittal or the timing or nature of any such vote. Neither the City Council's consideration of SMP's financial submittal nor a vote to allow issuance of a Project Construction Permit is, or shall be interpreted to be, a guarantee of the viability of the Monorail Transit System. Neither SMP nor its agents, potential credit enhancers, purchasers of SMP debt or any other third parties may rely on any aspect of the City Council's consideration of SMP's financial submittal. Any SMP official statement or similar disclosure document for SMP debt shall include substantially the following language:

 "The [SMP] is not an instrumentality or subdivision of the City of Seattle, but is an independent political subdivision of the State of Washington. The [obligations] are not obligations of the State of Washington, the City of Seattle or any other political subdivision of the State other than the [SMP], and are payable only from the [pledged taxes and/or revenues]."

 SMP also shall include substantially the foregoing in its oral presentations to rating agencies, potential investors, credit enhancers, and others concerned with rating, enhancing, or purchasing potential or actual SMP debt.

 Furthermore, if any such official statement or disclosure document refers to the City Council's consideration of SMP's financial submittal or vote to allow issuance of Project Construction Permits, that official statement or disclosure document shall include substantially the following language:

 (If after the City Council has voted to allow:) "The City of Seattle's consideration of SMP's finances or other factors prior to voting to allow issuance of Project Construction Permits may not be relied upon by investors for any purpose in making an investment decision with respect to the [obligations]. The City's consideration was solely to determine whether to allow construction of [SMP] improvements in City right-of-way. Neither that consideration nor the City Council's vote was undertaken for the purpose of determining [SMP's] ability or willingness to repay [obligations] to [bondowners] or to satisfy covenants relating to those [obligations]."

 (If before City Council votes:) The City of Seattle's [anticipated or ongoing] consideration of SMP's finances or other factors prior to voting to allow issuance of Project Construction Permits may not be relied upon by investors for any purpose in making an investment decision with respect to the [obligations]. The City's consideration will be solely to determine whether to allow construction of [SMP] improvements in City right-of-way. Neither that consideration nor the City Council's vote will be undertaken for the purpose of determining [SMP's] ability or willingness to repay [obligations] to [bondowners] or to satisfy covenants relating to those [obligations]."

 If SMP refers in its oral presentations to the City Council's anticipated consideration of SMP's financial submittal or vote to allow issuance of Project Construction Permits, SMP shall describe that consideration and vote in substantially the terms quoted above.

 SMP may modify any of the above-quoted language with prior approval from the City's Director of Finance.

 B. SMP shall obtain the approval of the Director of Transportation of SMP's overall sequence of construction prior to any construction work commencing on Monorail Transit Facilities. SMP may seek such approval as soon as SMP has received a proposed construction schedule from the DBOM Contractor. In providing this approval or requiring a change to the proposed schedule, the Director of Transportation shall comply with the intent of subsection 3.1 and make every reasonable effort to: 1) maximize the opportunity to complete as much of the Monorail Project as possible before major construction starts on the Alaskan Way Viaduct and Seawall Project; 2) maximize the opportunity to shorten the overall duration of construction for major capital projects in the downtown core; and 3) maximize the opportunity for coordination of major capital projects that may be occurring simultaneously, including but not limited to the retrofit of the Downtown Seattle Transit Tunnel and major construction of the Alaskan Way Viaduct and Seawall project, so that construction impacts to the downtown core are minimized. Consistent with the intent stated in subsection 3.1 and the criteria listed in subsection 3.1.1.B., the Director of Transportation may approve the schedule of start and completion dates for construction activities for any Project Segment and/or Project Construction Package, and may impose fees for construction activities in the Public Rights-of-Way beyond the approved completion date pursuant to Ordinance 121334, adopting a street use fee schedule imposing a surcharge on activities in streets that block traffic mobility.

 9.2 General Indemnification.

 9.2.1 To the extent permitted by law, each party to this Agreement shall protect, defend, indemnify, and save harmless the other party, and its officers, officials, employees, and agents, while acting within the scope of their employment, from any and all costs, claims, demands, judgments, damages, or liability of any kind including injuries to persons or damages to property, which arise out of, or in any way result from, or are connected to, or are due to any negligent acts or omissions of the indemnifying party. No party shall be required to indemnify, defend, or save harmless the other party if the claim, suit or action for injuries, death or damages is caused by the sole negligence of the party seeking indemnification. Where such claims, suits, or actions result from concurrent negligence of the parties, the indemnity provisions provided herein shall be valid and enforceable only to the extent of the party's own negligence. Each party agrees that its obligations under this subsection 9.2 extend to any claim, demand, and/or cause of action brought by, or on behalf of, any of its employees or agents. In the event of any claims, demands, actions or lawsuits, the indemnifying party upon prompt notice from the other party shall assume all costs of defense thereof, including legal fees incurred by the other party, and of all resulting judgments that may be obtained against the other party, to the extent of the indemnitor's liability. In the event that any party incurs attorneys' fees, costs or other legal expenses to enforce the provisions of this subsection 9.2, all such fees, costs and expenses shall be recoverable by the prevailing party.

 9.2.3 Survival of Indemnification Obligations. Any liability of the parties hereto for acts or omissions occurring during the term of this Agreement, including subsection 9.3.12, or arising under any indemnity provision of this Agreement, shall survive termination and surrender (whether or not any claim giving rise to such liability shall have accrued).

 9.3 Environmental Protection And Indemnification.

 9.3.1 Intent: This subsection 9.3 expresses the parties' intent and agreements relating to prudent practices for protecting human health, the environment and the Public Rights-of-Way (including without limitation utilities therein) from Hazardous Substances or contamination that may be related to or discovered during construction or operation of the Project. In addition, this subsection 9.3 allocates to SMP responsibility for environmental cleanup and cleanup costs on, in, under or adjacent to the Public Rights-of-Way caused or necessitated by construction or operation of the Project, including utility relocations related to the Project, and provides for a protocol for addressing Hazardous Substances or contamination discovered during construction or operation of the project.

 9.3.3 Restrictions on SMP Activities: Except as necessary for ordinary construction activities and in compliance with all applicable Environmental or Safety Laws, SMP and its employees, agents and contractors shall not cause Hazardous Substances to occur in, on or under the Public Rights-of-Way or the Monorail Transit Way, or permit the same to be used for the generation, production, manufacture, refinement, transportation, treatment, storage, handling, disposal, transfer, release or processing of Hazardous Substances.

 9.3.4 Compliance and Correction of Violations: With respect to the Monorail Transit Way, SMP shall comply, and shall guarantee compliance by all of its employees, agents and contractors, with all Environmental or Safety Laws at all times during the term of this Agreement. If SMP or any of SMP's employees, agents or contractors violates any applicable Environmental or Safety Law or any of the terms of this Agreement concerning the presence or use of Hazardous Substances or the handling or storing of Hazardous Substances, upon receipt of notice of such violation or the expiration of all challenges and appeals of such notice, whichever occurs later, SMP shall promptly take such action as is necessary to mitigate and correct the violation. If SMP does not act in a prudent and prompt manner, the City reserves the right, but not the obligation, upon reasonable prior notice to SMP, to act in place of SMP (for which purpose, only, SMP hereby appoints City as its agent), to come onto the Monorail Transit Way and to take such action as is necessary to ensure compliance or to mitigate the violation, all at SMP's sole cost and expense. In the event the City exercises the above right to take action, the City will consult with SMP regarding potential impacts on construction or operational activities, and will endeavor in good faith to avoid or minimize such impacts, except that the provisions in this sentence shall not apply in cases of Emergency or where necessary for City compliance with notices or orders issued or directed to the City by any authority with jurisdiction.

 9.3.5 Environmental Testing: SMP shall have the authority and responsibility to undertake due diligence, all appropriate inquiry, and appropriate environmental testing within the Public Rights-of-Way as necessary for the construction and operation of the Project.

In addition, SMP shall permit City access to portions of the Project located within the Monorail Transit Way at any time, upon reasonable notice, for the purpose of conducting environmental testing at the City's expense. In exercising the above rights of inspection and testing, the City will consult with SMP regarding any potential impacts on construction or operational activities, and will endeavor in good faith to avoid or minimize such impacts. SMP shall promptly inform SDOT of the existence of any environmental study, evaluation, investigation or results of any environmental testing conducted on the Public Rights- of-Way or the portions of the Project located within the Public Rights-of-Way whenever the same becomes known to SMP, and SMP shall provide a written copy of the same to SDOT as soon as reasonably possible and not later than thirty (30) days after the preparation of any such material by SMP or any of SMP's employees, agents, consultants or contractors.

 9.3.6 Hazardous Substances Discovered During SMP Construction or Operations: Throughout the term of this Agreement, SMP shall bear all costs and expenses of Hazardous Substances management activities, including Remedial Work addressing Hazardous Substances, discovery of Existing Hazardous Substances or other contamination in, on or under the Public Rights-of-Way, that result from or are necessitated by construction or operation of the Project, including utility relocations related to the Project. Prior to any construction in the Public Rights-of-Way, SMP shall develop a detailed protocol for Hazardous Substances management for review and approval by the City. The protocol will address issues such as: timing of any notice to the City, if required; responsibility for, content and timing of notice to the Washington Department of Ecology, where necessary; communication and coordination mechanisms between the City and SMP, including coordination regarding utilities; record-keeping requirements; preparation and distribution of reports, including progress reports and MTCA Independent Remedial Action reports; establishment of cleanup levels; worker health and safety; remedial contractor approval; responsibility for acquiring necessary permits; site access; measures for minimizing construction delay; work stoppage; and dispute resolution. Standard management protocols for different types of minor contamination and Remedial Work may also be established. Any sites posing a significant threat to human health and the environment will be addressed on a case by case basis, and may involve site- specific written agreements on Remedial Work between the City and SMP.

 SMP shall, consistent with the protocol, undertake such investigation and remediation of Hazardous Substances contamination, including contamination existing outside of the limits of the Monorail Transit Facilities, both within the Public Rights-of-Way and adjacent to the Public Rights-of-Way, necessary to: address any order or written recommendation of the Washington Department of Ecology or other regulatory agency with jurisdiction; address disturbance of contamination due to construction of the Project and related utility relocations where additional Remedial Work is necessary to stabilize and control the site, including prevention of recontamination or adverse water quality impacts; or address situations where the Project construction or operation will make future Remedial Work more difficult or costly.

 SMP shall ensure that all excavated Hazardous Substances are removed from the site or otherwise remediated to a cleanup standard consistent with applicable Environmental or Safety Laws, SDOT standard specifications, and SDOT policy and, when removed, are properly disposed of off site at an approved facility. SMP shall be identified as the generator for purposes of the disposal of all materials excavated in connection with the SMP Project. Excavated material with observed or detected Hazardous Substances may be not be used as backfill without the written approval of SDOT or as specifically provided in the approved protocol and only where use is in accordance with SDOT standard specifications and policies for clean fill.

 SMP is responsible for obtaining all regulatory approvals for the Remedial Work after consultation with SDOT. No institutional controls shall be implemented relating to Public Rights-of-Way without the prior written consent of the City. No restrictive covenants shall be implemented relating to Public Rights-of-Way, except for use of SDOT's alternative notification system pursuant to WAC 173-340-440(8)(b). No monitoring wells or other remedial facilities shall be located within the Public Rights-of-Way without specific SDOT permit. SMP must provide for future monitoring, maintenance and removal of all monitoring wells or remedial facilities located within the Public Rights-of-Way. SDOT may, at the City's sole option, notify SMP that a lesser degree of remediation fulfills SMP's remediation obligations stated herein. In the event that some Hazardous Substances will be left in place beneath any Monorail Transit Facilities located on or below the surface of the Public Rights-of-Way, SMP hereby agrees to indemnify the City for future Remedial Work and claims relating to those Hazardous Substances.

 9.3.7 Remedial Work: As used in this subsection 9.3, the term "Remedial Work" means all activities which are performed by or on behalf of SMP or the City in connection with the discovery, identification, investigation, assessment, cleanup, removal, mitigation, monitoring or containment of Existing Hazardous Substances, including any Remedial Work that is ordered by any court or any other governmental agency or that is needed to meet the requirements of any Environmental or Safety Laws, including voluntary cleanups or remedial actions necessary for a No Further Action letter or other equivalent determination. "Remedial Work" includes work necessary to address Existing Hazardous Substances discovered during utility removals, relocations, replacements, or installations related to the Project. "Remedial Work" includes all activities reasonably necessary to prepare and review any written agreements on Remedial Work and/or to comply with any written agreements on Remedial Work and/or with cleanup standards under Environmental or Safety Laws, in connection with the presence, suspected presence, release or threatened or suspected release of an Existing Hazardous Substance in or into the air, soil, ground water, surface water or soil vapor at, on, or within the Public Rights-of-Way, including, but not limited to, the removal of any underground storage tank. The term "Remedial Work" includes the City's observing or monitoring of Remedial Work in compliance with any written agreement on Remedial Work and also includes negotiations with the Washington Department of Ecology or its employees or consultants relating to the activities described in this subsection 9.3 or the MTCA Independent Remedial Action Program, but does not include work performed by attorneys or employed staff of SMP or the City, other than the SDOT Environmental Manager (or his or her designee) or the SDOT Project Manager for Remedial Work, as those terms are defined in the approved protocol for Hazardous Substances management provided for in subsection 9.3.6, or City temporary employees not regularly assigned to the SMP Project.

 9.3.8 Compliance with Laws: For all activities related to the Project, including Hazardous Substances management and Remedial Work, SMP is solely responsible for compliance with all applicable Environmental or Safety Laws. Nothing in this Agreement, including the City's receipt, review or approval of any request for authorization, data, record, report, or plan shall relieve SMP of any legal obligation, including but not limited to the obligation to provide a safe and healthful working environment or to comply with all Environmental or Safety Laws.

 9.3.9 Dispute Resolution: The parties shall work together in good faith to resolve any disagreements regarding matters addressed in this subsection 9.3, including the extent or nature of Remedial Work at any particular location, in accordance with the process set forth in section 13, Dispute Resolution. The parties shall endeavor to resolve such disputes promptly, and in a manner that protects public and environmental health and safety, recognizes Public Rights-of-Way management responsibilities, and minimizes delay of Project construction or interference with Project operations.

 9.3.10 Removal of Hazardous Substances: In addition to all other requirements under this Agreement, SMP or SMP's contractor shall promptly remove or otherwise remediate in compliance with Environmental or Safety Laws any and all Hazardous Substances, released on, in or under the Public Rights-of-Way by SMP or any of its employees, agents or contractors during the term of this Agreement. Upon the expiration or termination of this Agreement, SMP shall remove from the Public Rights-of-Way all Hazardous Substances stored on site as a result of any activities by or for SMP. SMP shall demonstrate such removal and any remediation necessary for protection of human health and the environment to SDOT's reasonable satisfaction, which may include, but is not limited to, attaining MTCA cleanup levels and applying for and obtaining from the Washington Department of Ecology a final No Further Action (NFA) letter pursuant to the Independent Remedial Action Program. The NFA letter shall not be considered "final" for the purposes of this Agreement if the letter describes institutional controls or other conditions, unless the City has agreed in writing to such institutional controls or conditions in lieu of further remediation. SMP shall provide copies to the City of all records pertaining to remediation and disposal.

 9.3.11 Reimbursement of City Costs: In addition to any remedy provided above the City shall be entitled to full reimbursement from SMP whenever City incurs any cost directly resulting from a violation by SMP or SMP's employees, agents or contractors of any Environmental or Safety Laws or of the terms of this subsection 9.3, including, but not limited to, the costs of any investigation, clean-up and other remedial actions; the fees of consultants, contractors, and attorneys; fines and penalties assessed directly against the City; and costs of injuries to third persons or other property due to environmental conditions.

 9.3.12 Release and Indemnification: In addition to all other indemnification provided in this Agreement and consistent with the intent expressed in subsection 9.3.1 and notwithstanding the expiration or earlier termination of this Agreement, SMP shall release, defend, indemnify and hold the City free and harmless from any and all claims, causes of action, regulatory demands, liabilities, fines, penalties, losses, damages, consequential damages and expenses, including without limitation environmental cleanup or other remedial costs (and including the fees of consultants, contractors and attorneys, costs and all other reasonable litigation expenses when incurred and whether incurred in defense of actual litigation or in reasonable anticipation of litigation), whether made, commenced or incurred during the term of this Agreement or after the expiration or termination of this Agreement, resulting from SMP's construction or operation of the Project if arising out of any of the following: (i) the presence on, in or under the Public Rights-of-Way or Project during the term of this Agreement, or the migration from the Public Rights-of-Way or Project to other property or into the surrounding environment, of any Hazardous Substances other than a Hazardous Substance brought onto the Public Rights-of-Way or the Monorail Project solely by the City or by any of its employees, agents or contractors; (ii) SMP's breach of any provision of the Environmental Protection and Indemnification provisions of this Agreement (subsection 9.3); (iii) the acts or omissions of SMP or any of SMP's employees, agents or contractors in remedying any environmental contamination discovered in preparation for or during any construction or operation undertaken by or for SMP; or (iv) any enforcement, cleanup, removal, remedial or other governmental or regulatory actions, agreements or orders made pursuant to Environmental or Safety Laws, together with any and all claims in law or equity made or suits by any party (including claims for indemnity, contribution, subrogation, and diminution in property value) against the City for damages, contribution, cost recovery, loss or injury, resulting from the SMP's construction or operation under this Agreement, including but not limited to, any claims against the City by SMP or any of its employees, agents, contractors or subcontractors based upon delay in construction or other activity resulting from Remedial Work or other environmental remediation activities conducted during the term of the Agreement. If a court of competent jurisdiction determines that the provisions of RCW 4.24.115 govern any application of this indemnification obligation, then, in situations of liability for damages arising out of bodily injury to persons or damage to property caused by or resulting from the concurrent negligence the City, including its agents and employees, and the SMP, including its agents and employees, the indemnification shall apply only to the extent of SMP's negligence. SMP further agrees to release the City from any and all claims, causes of action, liabilities and damages arising from the City's exercise of its right (or from the City's choice not to exercise its right) to undertake investigation or remediation of contamination existing in or adjacent to the Public Rights-of-Way.

 9.3.13 Reservation of Rights. Except as provided in subsection 9.3.12 (Release and Indemnification), SMP and the City reserve the right to recover contribution for SMP's or the City's costs of Hazardous Substances management, including costs of Remedial Work, from other potentially liable persons or potentially responsible parties as those terms are defined under applicable Environmental or Safety Laws. SMP and the City agree that the parties, solely by reason of being public agencies holding Public Rights-of-Way or use authorizations, are not "owners or operators" for purposes of liability under any Environmental or Safety Laws, including, but not limited to, private rights of action for contribution under MTCA.

If SMP ceases to use any or all of the Monorail Transit Way for the Monorail Transit System without reasonable cause and the cessation continues for at least six (6) consecutive months without the SMP taking reasonable steps to resume operation, then, to the extent any portion of the Monorail Transit System remaining in the Public Rights-of-Way or on any other City property is not removed by SMP, the City, by ordinance, may declare it abandoned and it shall become the property of the City subject to applicable law. If the City determines not to exercise its right to take ownership, the City may after notice to SMP, require SMP to remove said remaining portion of the Monorail Transit System, subject to City approval of a removal plan or plans. SMP agrees to continue to exercise its taxing authority to the extent necessary to allow the City to effectuate such remedies and other remaining obligations under this Agreement, including, but not limited to, repayment of all obligations to bondholders and creditors. Reasonable cause for the purposes of this section 12 includes without limitation, acts of God; strikes; civil disturbances; earthquakes; and similar events outside the control of the SMP.

 12.4 Termination Prior to Completion of Construction. If, without reasonable cause, SMP is unable to complete construction of the Monorail Transit System, SMP shall be provided additional time as agreed by the parties to complete construction of the Monorail Transit System within a reasonable time, which shall include any time needed to pursue remedies against the DBOM Contractor and sureties. If after the additional time has passed, the SMP is unable to complete construction within a reasonable time, the City may, after notice to SMP and in its sole discretion, choose to exercise either of the remedies provided in subsection 12.3 above, subject to applicable law. SMP agrees to continue to exercise its taxing authority to the extent necessary to allow the City to effectuate such remedies and other remaining obligations under this Agreement, including, but not limited to, repayment of all obligations to bondholders and creditors.

 12.6 Order to Remove. Any order by the City issued pursuant to this section 12 to remove the Monorail Transit System in whole or in part shall be sent by registered or certified mail to SMP not later than twenty-four (24) months following the date of termination of this Agreement, or, if later, the final resolution of any appeal of the termination.

 12.7 Removal and Restoration Plan. SMP shall file a written removal and restoration plan with the City not later than sixty (60) calendar days following the date of the receipt of any orders directing removal, or any consent to removal, describing the work that will be performed, the manner in which it will be performed, and a schedule for removal by location. The removal plan shall be subject to approval and regulation by the City. The affected Public Rights-of- Way and other City property shall be restored to a condition at least as good as prior to construction or partial construction of the Monorail Transit System.

 12.8 Removal Bond. Within 60 days of the execution of the design- build-equip contract between SMP and its DBOM Contractor, SMP shall provide evidence satisfactory to the City's Director of Transportation that the performance and payment bonds provided by the DBOM Contractor, as referenced in subsection 9.1.6, can be used to satisfy SMP's obligations under subsections 12.4 and 12.7 of this Agreement. If SMP does not provide such satisfactory evidence, SMP shall deliver to the Director of Transportation for filing with the City Clerk a bond in the penal sum of Fifty-Four Million Dollars ($54,000,000) to reflect the reasonable cost of removal and restoration, naming the City as an obligee and conditioned that SMP shall remove the Monorail Transit System or portion thereof and restore the Public Rights-of-Way and other property to a condition at least as good as existed immediately prior to construction of the Monorail Transit System, in accordance with a removal order issued by the City, pursuant to section 12 of this Agreement. SMP shall maintain such a bond in full force and effect until one year after commencement of revenue service for the entire Monorail Transit System. Such bond shall be executed by a surety company authorized and licensed to do business in the State of Washington; listed on the Department of the Treasury's Listing of Approved Sureties (Department Circular 570); and subject to the underwriting limitation published therein on a per bond basis or written with a penal sum over the underwriting limitation as long as the excess amount is protected with reinsurance, coinsurance or other methods as specified at 31 CFR 223.10-11.

 12.9 Notwithstanding any other terms or provisions in this Agreement or in any approval or permit issued pursuant to this Agreement, the City shall not be liable for any damages or equitable remedies under this Agreement in connection with any act or omission by the City related to City of Seattle Initiative Measure No. 83 or any other initiative that purports to revoke or invalidate all or any part of this Agreement. Nothing in this paragraph shall be deemed a statement or admission by either party regarding the validity (under any legal theory including, but not limited to, impairment of contract) of City of Seattle Initiative Measure No. 83 or any other initiative that purports to revoke or invalidate all or any part of this Agreement. The City acknowledges that the SMP intends to rely on this Agreement to implement the Project and that the SMP will be entering into additional contracts to implement the Project.

 SECTION 13. DISPUTE RESOLUTION

 13.1 In the event that the parties' Designated Representatives cannot resolve a disagreement arising under or in connection with this Agreement, the parties shall follow the dispute resolution steps set forth below.

 13.1.1 A party's Designated Representative shall notify the other party's Designated Representative in writing of any problem or dispute that a party believes needs resolution. The written notice shall include (a) a description of the issue to be resolved; (b) a description of the differences between the parties on the issue; and (c) a summary of any steps taken to resolve the issue.

 13.1.2 Upon receipt of a written notice of request for dispute resolution, under this subsection 13.1, the following officials shall meet within five (5) business days and attempt to resolve the dispute: for the City, its Director of Transportation; for SMP, its Director of Construction if the dispute relates to construction, or its Director of Operations if the dispute relates to operations.

 13.2 The City and SMP shall make good faith efforts to resolve any dispute arising under or in connection with this Agreement by using the dispute resolution process described in subsections 13.1.1 through 13.1.2 above. If the disputed issue has not been resolved at the conclusion of the process, a party may initiate non-binding mediation of the dispute. Within ten (10) days of receiving written notice of initiation of non-binding mediation by one or both parties, each party shall designate in writing not more than five (5) candidates it proposes to act as a non-binding mediator. The parties shall within an additional five (5) days select one of the mediators from either list to serve as mediator. Should the parties be unable to agree upon a mediator, a mediator shall be chosen from one of the two lists by the presiding judge of the King County Superior Court at Seattle. Upon selection of the mediator, the parties shall use reasonable efforts to resolve the dispute within thirty (30) days with the assistance of the mediator. The cost of mediation shall be shared by Seattle and SMP equally, except that each party shall be responsible for its own attorney's fees and other costs incurred solely for its own benefit.

 13.2.1 If mediation fails to resolve the dispute within thirty (30) days of selection of the mediator, the parties may thereafter seek redress in court.

 13.2.2 Pending the decision in any mediation or litigation process pursuant to this section 13, the parties to such process shall continue to fulfill their respective duties under this Agreement.

 SECTION 14. REMEDIES; ENFORCEMENT

 14.1 Remedies. The City has the right to exercise any and all of the following remedies, singly or in combination, in the event SMP violates any provision of this Agreement:

 A. Commencing an action at law for monetary damages;

 B. Commencing an action for equitable or other relief;

 C. Seeking specific performance of any provision that reasonably lends itself to such remedy.

 14.2 Cumulative Remedies. In determining which remedy or remedies for SMP's violation are appropriate, a court may take into consideration the nature and extent of the violation, the remedy needed to prevent such violations in the future, whether SMP has a history of previous violations of the same or similar kind, and such other considerations as are appropriate under the circumstances. Remedies are cumulative; the exercise of one shall not foreclose the exercise of others.

 14.3 Failure to Enforce. SMP shall not be relieved of any of its obligations to comply promptly with any provision of this Agreement by reason of any failure of the City to enforce prompt compliance, and the City's failure to enforce shall not constitute a waiver of rights or acquiescence in SMP's conduct.

 SECTION 15. COVENANTS AND WARRANTIES

 15.1 By execution of this Agreement, the City warrants:

 A. That the City has the full right and authority to enter into and perform this Agreement and any permits which may be granted in accordance with the terms hereof, and that by entering into or performing this Agreement the City is not in violation of its charter or by-laws, or any law, regulation or agreement by which it is bound or to which it is bound or to which it is subject; it being understood, however, that the covenant and warranty contained in this section 15 does not constitute a warranty, expressed or implied, by the City, of the right or rights granted by the City to SMP hereunder; and

 SECTION 16. RECORDINGS, TAXES AND OTHER CHARGES

 16.1 SMP shall pay all transfer taxes, documentary stamps, recording costs or fees, or any similar expense in connection with the recording or filing of any permits that may be granted hereunder. SMP further agrees that if it is determined by any federal, state or local governmental authority that the sale, acquisition, license, grant, transfer or disposition of any part or portion of the Monorail Transit Facilities or rights herein described requires the payment of any tax, levy, excise, assessment, or charges (including, without limitation, property, sales or use tax) under any statute, regulation or rule, SMP shall pay the same, plus any penalty and/or interest thereon, directly to said taxing authority and shall hold the City harmless therefrom. SMP shall pay all taxes, levies, excises, assessments or charges, including any penalties and/or interest thereon, levied or assessed on the Monorail Transit Facilities, or on account of their existence or use (including increases thereof attributable to such existence or use, and excluding taxes based on the income of the City), and shall indemnify the City against payment thereof. SMP shall have the right to claim, and the City shall reasonably cooperate with SMP in the prosecution of any such claim, for refund, rebate, reduction or abatement of such tax(es).

 16.2 The City may pay any tax, levy, excise, assessment or charge, plus any penalty and/or interest thereon, imposed upon SMP for which SMP is obligated pursuant to this section 16, if SMP does not pay such tax, levy, excise, assessment, or charge when due. SMP shall reimburse the City for any such payment made pursuant to the previous sentence, plus interest at the prime rate per annum, as published in the Wall Street Journal.

 SECTION 17. ASSIGNABILITY; BENEFICIARY

 17.1 This Agreement shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the parties hereto and their respective successors or assignees. No assignment hereof or sublease shall be valid for any purpose without the prior written consent of the other party, and any attempt by one party to assign or license the rights or obligations hereunder without prior written consent will give the other party the right, at its written election, immediately to terminate this Agreement or take any other lesser action with respect thereto. The above requirement for consent shall not apply to (i) any disposition of all or substantially all of the assets of a party; (ii) any governmental entity merger, consolidation or reorganization, whether voluntary or involuntary; (iii) a sublease or assignment of this Agreement (in whole or in part) to a governmental entity; or (iv) a sale, lease, or other conveyance by the City, subject to those requirements set forth in this Agreement; provided however, that no sublease or assignment under (iii) shall be permitted to a governmental entity not operating, constructing or maintaining a Monorail Transit System on behalf of SMP; and provided further, that no unconsented assignment shall relieve SMP of its obligations and liabilities under this Agreement.

 17.2 Either party hereto may assign any monetary receivables due it under this Agreement; provided, however, such assignment shall not relieve the assignor of any of its rights or obligations under this Agreement.

 17.3 SMP acknowledges and agrees that the City may designate, in writing, a designee to (i) receive information (including information designated or identified as confidential) and notices under this Agreement, and (ii) provide certain approvals or consents required from the City under this Agreement. In the event of such designation, SMP may rely on approvals or consents by such designee on behalf of the City as fully as if such actions were performed by the designator itself.

 19.10 All exhibits are by this reference incorporated into this Agreement.

 19.11 This Agreement may be executed in several counterparts, each of which shall be deemed an original, and all counterparts together shall constitute but one and the same instrument.

 SECTION 20. LEGAL FORUM

 This Agreement shall be interpreted, construed and enforced in accordance with the laws of the State of Washington. Venue for any action under this Agreement shall be King County, Washington.

 SECTION 21. INTERPRETATION

 This Agreement is executed by all parties under current interpretations of applicable federal, state or local statute, ordinance, law or regulation.

 SECTION 22. SEVERABILITY

 22.1 In case any term of this Agreement shall be held invalid, illegal or unenforceable in whole or in part, neither the validity of the remaining part of such term nor the validity of the remaining terms of this Agreement shall in any way be affected thereby.

 22.2 Notwithstanding the foregoing, the material provisions of this Agreement are not severable. In the event that a court, agency or legislature of competent jurisdiction acts or declares any nonmaterial provision of this Agreement to be unenforceable according to its terms, or otherwise void, said provision shall be considered a separate, distinct, and independent part of this Agreement, and such holding shall not affect the validity and enforceability of all other provisions hereof. In the event that a court, agency or legislature of competent jurisdiction acts so that, or declares that, any material provision of this Agreement is unenforceable according to its terms, or is otherwise void, the City and SMP agree to immediately enter into negotiations in good faith to restore the relative burdens and benefits of this Agreement, consistent with applicable law. If the City and SMP are unable to agree to a modification of this Agreement within sixty (60) days, the parties shall resolve their disagreement in accordance with section 13, Dispute Resolution.

 22.3 Notwithstanding the foregoing, if either SMP or the City believes a provision is not material, it must commence an action challenging the materiality within fourteen (14) days of a request by the other that it enter into negotiations. The obligation to negotiate is not tolled, and the City and SMP must discharge their negotiation responsibility notwithstanding the dispute as to materiality. If there is a dispute as to materiality, the remedies provided for in the preceding paragraph shall be cumulative, not alternative. The remedies provided for herein do not prevent the City or SMP from contending that a particular provision is enforceable, or foreclose any remedies if a provision is enforceable.

 Exhibit A: Not Used Exhibit B: Not Used EXHIBIT C

 Exhibit C:

 Additional Conditions of Grant of Non-Exclusive Use

 1. SMP implementation of and compliance with the Mitigation Program described in the Green Line Final Environmental Impact Statement, (Seattle Monorail Project and U.S. Coast Guard, March, 2004), incorporated herein by reference. The Program includes, but is not limited to, construction mitigation and impacts to transportation, historic and cultural resources, water quality, and other areas of the environment as the Green Line is designed, constructed and operated.

 2. SMP implementation of and compliance with the Memorandum of Agreement between the Seattle Monorail Project and U.S. Coast Guard, the State of Washington Historic Preservation Officer, and the City of Seattle Historic Preservation Officer. The Memorandum of Agreement will provide mitigation for adverse effects to historic and cultural resources located along the Green Line.

 3. SMP or its DBOM Contractor shall do the following to assist businesses impacted by the construction of the Green Line:

 a) Develop and implement a public relations plan that will provide that residents and businesses are kept fully informed about potentially significant disruptions, such as temporary street closures, changes in transit service, and parking availability;

 b) Develop a 24 hour monitoring center that provides telephone access for the public to get construction information and to make complaint and incidental reports;

 c) Develop a multi-media public information program to provide information regarding street closures, hours of construction, business access, and parking impacts;

 d) Provide staff to serve as a community ombudsman;

 e) Maintain access to businesses during construction activities;

 f) Develop a marketing and business assistance program to mitigate the construction impacts of the Green Line. The program would provide assistance such as low-interest working capital loans, including incentives to renew leases and remain along the Green Line during construction, to support the loss of revenue experienced during construction, and technical assistance with marketing, accounting, general management, and finance. For the purposes of this section, business owners include those who own or lease property;

 g) Coordinate street sweeping services in construction areas with construction activity, particularly areas with surrounding residential and retail development;

 h) Post advance notice signs prior to construction in areas where surface construction activities will affect access to surrounding businesses;

 i) Implement the business assistance program set forth in Appendix C of the Memorandum of Agreement referenced in section 2 above;

 j) Distribute to all businesses information packets containing construction details such as special construction activities, timelines, and contact names and phone numbers.

 4. Design excellence is paramount throughout the system, including the guideway, columns, switches, bents, and other system elements, as well as related access improvements adjacent to the system as described in subsection 4.e) below. Design excellence and quality access will be of benefit to all neighborhoods in the system, to ridership levels, and to the overall success of the project. Therefore, it is the City's intent that SMP will commit resources to enable quality design and access to the system, consistent with the City's adopted Monorail Transit System Design Guidelines, as interpreted by the Monorail Review Panel. Design excellence shall emphasize the design and materials for bridge spans, guideway columns, switches, bents, other guideway structures, and other system elements to create the appearance of less mass, including bents, columns and guideways that are more slender in appearance.

 In order to balance the City's intent to help ensure design excellence and support monorail project cost containment with the goal of integrating the monorail into the overall transportation system, neighborhoods, and the urban environment, SMP will complete the following monorail station access improvements. Adherence to this section shall not preclude the City's ability to condition the project under the City's SEPA authority or consistent with the Seattle Municipal Code provisions. Improvements shall include:

 a) Improvements to facilitate pedestrian access to the Elliott/Mercer Monorail Station from Uptown/Seattle Center Urban Center neighborhood, such as an elevated pedestrian connection to the station fare-paid zone, or other pedestrian improvements approved in a Master Use Permit.

 b) Improvements to at-grade connections between the 5th & Stewart monorail station and Westlake Center.

 c) An elevated walkway between the King/Weller monorail station and the existing Weller Street Pedestrian Bridge, if permitted by any required third-party approvals.

 d) At-grade improvements at the Delridge station area to provide enhanced safety and security. These will include lighting, CCTV monitoring integrated into the Green Line CCTV security system, or alternatives that may be approved in a Master Use Permit.

 e) Improvements to major pedestrian routes as identified in Table 1, including reasonable enhancements to existing sidewalks and paths, pedestrian safety facilities (such as crosswalks and retiming of signals), and streetscape elements (such as lighting, landscape and urban design elements) to be proposed by SMP in permit applications and specified by the City in Project Construction Permits.

 f) SMP shall provide or cause to be provided grade-separated pedestrian access to the west side of the BNSF railroad tracks for any station in the vicinity of Safeco Field and Qwest Stadium and Exhibition Hall.

 Final construction permits for the station in the vicinity of Safeco Field and Qwest Field and Exhibition Hall shall not be issued by the City until execution of a multi-party agreement to fund construction of a shared use, grade-separated, public, pedestrian crossing that fully implements the prior legal obligations, if any, of the PFD and First and Goal and includes the necessary real property approvals of the BNSF and WSDOT should their properties be affected.

 g) The City and SMP agree that a station on 2nd Avenue between Madison and Spring streets is an important element of the monorail system in the downtown core. Toward that end, the City is committed, excluding financial assistance, to helping the monorail secure the necessary property rights for this station. The station at this location is considered part of the entire Green Line with respect to subsection 3.1.1.A of this Agreement and SMP with the City's assistance shall use its best efforts to secure such rights. The funds allocated to the right-of-way acquisition, and design and construction of this station shall be reserved by the SMP until such time as the property becomes available, even if after the completion of the initial Green Line.

 If at some future date the SMP and the City of Seattle mutually determine that the station cannot be built at the proposed location, the two parties shall determine other pedestrian access improvements to other Green Line stations in downtown Seattle, to/from both the ferry terminal and business/residences in the general vicinity of this station, to be implemented by SMP up to the budgeted costs of station construction.

 5. In order to balance the City's intent to help ensure design excellence and support monorail project cost containment with the goal of integrating the monorail into the overall transportation system, neighborhoods, and the urban environment, SMP will complete the item set forth below within 3 years after project construction is completed.

 a) Spot improvements to major pedestrian routes as identified in Table 2, including enhancements such as wayfinding and other spot improvements to existing sidewalks and paths, pedestrian safety facilities (such as crosswalks and retiming of signals), and streetscape elements (such as lighting, landscape and urban design elements).

 6. The priorities below represent the City's and SMP's priorities as of the date of this Agreement. SMP will dedicate $5 million to pursue transit oriented development and community development partnerships for the items set forth below, to be completed within 5 years after project construction is completed. Because areas adjacent to but outside the perimeter of the monorail system may change over time, at the time of implementation, the City and SMP will jointly determine whether the improvements listed below continue to be a priority for integrating the monorail in the overall transportation system and urban environment. The City and SMP may adjust this set of priorities as needs arise by mutual agreement.

 a) Associated development of the parcel or parcels at the southwest corner of NW 85th Street and 15th Avenue NW.

 b) Associated development of the parcel or parcels south of the monorail station on the block between Virginia and Stewart streets on 5th Avenue, including an entry and connections to a station fare-paid zone.

 c) Improvements to Westlake Center and the Westlake Station of the Downtown Seattle Transit Tunnel to facilitate transfers between light rail and monorail transit.

 d) Associated development of the unused portion of the parcel bounded by 2nd Avenue, James Street and Yesler Way (a.k.a., "Sinking Ship Garage").

 e) Improvements to King Street Station, 4th Avenue South, the International District station of the Downtown Seattle Transit Tunnel, and/or the North Kingdome Parking Lot to facilitate transfers between monorail transit and various other modes of transportation.

 f) Associated development of parcels on the block of California Avenue SW bounded by SW Alaska and SW Edmunds, including an entry and connections to a station fare-paid zone.

 7. SMP and SDOT shall enter into an agreement for a tree replacement plan that is consistent with the principle of no net loss of tree canopy due to monorail construction.

 8. The City supports SMP's intent to design, construct, and operate the Monorail Transit System in a manner that maximizes accessibility and independence for all passengers. To that end, SMP will develop a disability access plan for the Green Line system. To assist in the development of the plan, SMP will form a community advisory committee on disability access that will meet regularly and advise the SMP, and its disability access consultant on accessibility issues related to design, construction, and ongoing operations. To the extent possible, SMP will implement the recommendations of the committee. The disability access advisory committee will report its final recommendations to the SMP Board prior to implementation of the accessibility plan.

 9. SMP shall pay, or reimburse King County Metro for, the costs associated with any temporary or permanent relocation or protection of King County Metro Transit's electric trolley bus infrastructure that is necessitated by the construction or operation of the Monorail Transit System.

 10. a) SMP will conduct an on-street parking inventory around stations at Crown Hill, NW 65th NW Market, Dravus, Delridge, Avalon, Alaska Junction, and Morgan Junction within the year preceding each station opening. SMP and the City will agree on a study methodology.

 b) Based on the study results, SMP and City staff will work with affected neighborhoods in the station study areas to identify and implement appropriate mitigation elements prior to the station openings. These controls may include parking meters; time-limit signs; passenger, truck, and load/unload zones; and Residential Parking Zones (RPZs) up to 1/4 miles around each identified station. City and SMP staff will attend community meetings to present proposals and document support for various parking controls. Support for RPZs may be documented by surveys or other appropriate community outreach efforts to adjacent tenants/residents and property owners conducted by SMP, with City assistance.

 c) The City will monitor all parking controls, including any RPZs, during the first two years after the entire Green Line opens. If RPZ boundaries or other on-street controls adjacent to stations are insufficient, City staff will work with the affected neighborhoods to adjust as necessary. SMP will participate with the City in these discussions with neighborhoods. SMP will be responsible for funding any expansions of parking controls as described below.

 d) SMP will fund the following mitigation elements:

 1) Parking inventory studies around each identified station;

 2) Appropriate parking controls as determined by the City, SMP, and neighborhoods, including permit costs, labor, and all other related installation costs;

 3) Any newly-created RPZs, expansions of existing RPZs where the need for the expansion is due to the monorail, or other parking controls during the first two years of Green Line operations, including all costs for signs, labor and other related installation items; and

 4) Public education and marketing campaigns related to hide-and- ride parking and access to the monorail stations to be incorporated into SMP's community relations program.

 Nothing in this Exhibit limits the City's ability to impose reasonable conditions on land use and street use permits, consistent with the City's policies and authority under the State Environmental Policy Act (SEPA) and consistent with Seattle Municipal Code provisions, including those pertaining to review and approval of Monorail Transit Facilities, Section 15.54.020 and Chapter 23.80, Essential Public Facilities. Conditions imposed upon land use and street use permits pursuant to the City's SEPA authority shall be reasonable and capable of being accomplished, and shall be imposed only to mitigate adverse environmental impacts identified in the environmental documents prepared for the Project. Exercise of SEPA authority by SDOT or DPD shall not require an amendment to this Agreement.

 1. Determine the load strengthening, seismic retrofit and new construction required for the existing bridge. Computer model and analyze the existing bridge with the new monorail guideway added for AASHTO loads, monorail load conditions, and extreme loads such as seismic. Include the weight and effects of all new construction in the analysis. Provide load rating calculations that show that all elements of the bridge after the new construction will comply with the design criteria. Provide a testing report of any concrete or reinforcing bar material testing if such will be utilized in the load rating analysis. Provide a geotechnical report of existing pile capacities if such will be utilized in the load rating analysis. Provide draft specifications and special provisions.

 2. The preliminary design submittal shall clearly show the outlines of all the new construction required on the bridge. Provide detail sheets showing anchor blocks, deviator blocks, diaphragms, column bases, cap beam strengthening, seismic retrofits, and any other bridge strengthening that is required. These sheets shall include plan, elevation, and section views. Post-tensioning sheets shall be provided that show the final force and location of extra post- tensioning. Provide a relocation plan for all utility relocations that are required, indicating rerouting and phased construction as needed.

 d. In-Progress Design Submittal

 The in-progress design submittal shall include the following:

 Show the location, size and pattern of all reinforcing and post- tensioning that will be required. Provide post-tensioning details that show anchorages, extra reinforcing, and all hardware. All sections through new concrete shall be shown with reinforcing completely billed. Provide details of surface preparation of concrete, drilling holes, bonding anchors or bars. All structural steel added to the bridge shall be completely detailed and specified, with all connections shown. Provide specifications and special provisions. Provide detail on construction means and methods and a traffic control plan for staging construction to safely maintain traffic.

 e. Final Design Submittal
