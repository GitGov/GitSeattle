 AN ORDINANCE relating to the Light Fund; authorizing the loan of funds from the City's Consolidated (Residual) Cash Portfolio, or its participating Funds, to the Operating Cash Account within the Light Fund.

 WHEREAS, drought conditions and extremely high wholesale market prices in 2000 and 2001 caused Seattle City Light to spend almost $600 million more than planned on purchased power over the period; and

 WHEREAS, $300 million of purchased power expenses were deferred in 2001 and will be recognized over the period of 2002 through 2004, which is longer than initially anticipated; and

 WHEREAS, the Seattle City Council increased electric rates four times in 2001 with the result that the average rate is now 58% higher than the average rate adopted by the Council in November 1999; and

 WHEREAS, in spite of the rate increases in 2001, the Operating Cash Account within the Light Fund has been in a negative cash position since March 27, 2003; and

 WHEREAS, lower than anticipated wholesale market prices in 2002 and lower than average precipitation in the 2002-2003 water year have decreased the forecast of wholesale sales revenues and thus lowered the forecast rate at which the negative cash position will be reversed; and

 WHEREAS, cash available in excess of operating expenses and long-term debt service has been first used to repay the Department's $182 million Revenue Anticipation Note due March 28, 2003 and will be used to pay the $125 million Revenue Anticipation Note due November 21, 2003; and

 WHERAS, it is anticipated that the Operating Cash Account within the Light Fund will remain in a negative cash position until sometime in the month of July 2003 and will again become negative after repayment of the Revenue Anticipation Note on November 21, 2003 and will remain negative through mid-2004; and

 WHEREAS, there is a range of uncertainty about the forecast of the Operating Cash Account balance both as to the maximum size of the negative position and as to the date at which the negative position will end; and

 WHEREAS, there is sufficient cash in the City's Consolidated (Residual) Cash Portfolio or its participating Funds, to support a loan of up to One Hundred Million Dollars ($100,000,000) to the Operating Cash Account within the Light Fund terminating no later than December 31, 2004; NOW, THEREFORE,

 BE IT ORDAINED BY THE CITY OF SEATTLE AS FOLLOWS:

 Section 1. The City authorizes the loan of not to exceed Fifty Million Dollars ($50,000,000) principal amount outstanding at any one time, from the City's Consolidated (Residual) Cash Portfolio, or its participating Funds, to the Operating Cash Account within the Light Fund, that terminates no later than August 31, 2003. The Light Fund is authorized and directed to repay, no later than August 31, 2003, the entire principal amount of said loan with interest thereon at the rate of return of the City's Consolidated (Residual) Cash Portfolio.

 Section 2.

 Section 3. The City further authorizes the loan of not to exceed One Hundred Million Dollars ($100,000,000) principal amount outstanding at any one time, from the City's Consolidated (Residual) Cash Portfolio, or its participating Funds, to the Operating Cash Account within the Light Fund, that originates no earlier than October 31, 2003 and terminates no later than December 31, 2004.

 Section 5. By no later than October 16, 2003, City Light will provide a briefing to Council that summarizes its current financial situation, its actual operating cash balances through the third quarter of 2003 and its forecasts for operating cash balances through the end of 2004.
