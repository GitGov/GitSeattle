 AN ORDINANCE relating to Seattle Public Utilities' reservoir burying program; removing restrictions that limit spending of appropriations made in the 2004 Adopted Budget for burying the Maple Leaf, West Seattle, Beacon South, Myrtle and Roosevelt reservoirs; establishing a new schedule for implementation of individual reservoir burying projects; and amending Seattle Public Utilities' 2004-2009 Capital Improvement Program to reflect this new schedule.

 WHEREAS, Seattle Public Utilities is responsible for providing safe, reliable drinking water to approximately 1.3 million people in the greater Seattle metropolitan area; and

 WHEREAS, the Seattle Public Utilities reservoirs play an integral part in delivering safe, reliable water service to City residents and businesses; and

 WHEREAS, Seattle Public Utilities is required by the State Department of Health to complete a program to cover or bury its open, above- ground distribution system reservoirs by the year 2020; and

 WHEREAS, Seattle Public Utilities has completed the covering of the Bitter Lake and Lake Forest Park reservoirs, and will complete the burying of the Lincoln reservoir in 2004; and

 WHEREAS, the City Council and Mayor believe that replacing the City's remaining open reservoirs with underground reservoirs will help reduce the risk to City's reservoirs from potential contamination; and

 WHEREAS, the City Council and Mayor believe that constructing underground reservoirs rather than installing floating reservoir covers will minimize visual and environmental impacts; and

 WHEREAS, Seattle Public Utilities has made a preliminary determination that sufficient storage capacity exits elsewhere in the water system such that Roosevelt reservoir can taken out of service after Maple Leaf reservoir is buried, without adversely affecting system reliability; and

 WHEREAS, in August 2002, the City Council enacted Ordinance 120899, authorizing Seattle Public Utilities, subject to completion of environmental review, to replace certain existing City reservoirs with underground reservoirs; allocating cost responsibilities for the development of these projects between Seattle Public Utilities and Seattle Parks and Recreation thereby limiting the cost to be borne by the water rates; calling for a study of design-build contracting options for the construction of underground reservoirs; amending Ordinance 118477 (Initiative 42) to exempt from its limitations and requirements any open space created by replacing existing above ground reservoirs with underground reservoirs; and calling for a study of options for funding future underground reservoir projects; and

 WHEREAS, in 2003, Seattle Public Utilities submitted, and the City Council's Water and Health Committee reviewed, the Department's study of design-build-operate contracting options for construction of underground reservoirs, as well as the Department's reservoir funding options analysis; and

 WHEREAS, the City now plans to bury or decommission all remaining uncovered reservoirs over the 2004-2015 period; and

 WHEREAS, in adopting the 2004 budget, the City Council enacted budget provisos that imposed restrictions on certain capital appropriations; and

 WHEREAS, the City Council is satisfied that the budgetary restrictions pertaining to burying Maple Leaf, West Seattle, Beacon South, Volunteer, Myrtle and Roosevelt reservoirs should be lifted; NOW, THEREFORE,

 BE IT ORDAINED BY THE CITY OF SEATTLE AS FOLLOWS:

 Section 1. The restrictions imposed by the following budget proviso are removed and they are no longer restrictions for any purpose, including for Subsection 1(b) of Ordinance 121333:

 Department Green Sheet Proviso Description Summit Code SPU #029-1-3-1 States that "None of the C140B money appropriated for 2004 for the Seattle Public Utilities Water Fund budget can be spent to pay for burying Maple Leaf, West Seattle, Beacon South, Myrtle, or Roosevelt Reservoirs until authorized by ordinance."

 Section 2. SPU is hereby authorized to move forward on planning, design, and construction so as to bury the five reservoirs identified below. The Council anticipates that construction will be completed by the end of the respective years shown, unless SPU explains to the Council Committee responsible for utility matters any proposed change in schedule before the end of the anticipated completion year.
