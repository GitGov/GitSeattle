 AN ORDINANCE relating to land use, zoning and construction; amending Sections 23.76.005 and 23.76.010 of the Seattle Municipal Code (Title 23, Land Use Code) and Section 106.6 of the Seattle Building Code, Chapter 22.100 of the Seattle Municipal Code to establish time periods for decisions on project permit applications as required by RCW 36.70B.080.

 WHEREAS, the City of Seattle is required to comply with changes to RCW 36.70B.080 (ESHB 1458) requiring local government action on permit applications not to exceed one hundred twenty days; and

 WHEREAS, provisions of RCW 36.70B.140 allow local jurisdictions to exclude certain types of project permits from the permit review process contemplated by RCW 36.70B.060 through 36.70B.080; and

 WHEREAS, the Council determines that certain Type II Council Land Use actions present special circumstances that warrant exclusion from the time limits of RCW 36.70B.080, and pursuant to the authority of RCW 36.70B.140, applications for Environmentally Critical Area Exceptions are excluded from such time limits; and

 WHEREAS, the Council does so because the unique review process for Environmentally Critical Area Exceptions entails an additional legal and economic analysis for reasonable use of property that historically has substantially extended the review time for Environmentally Critical Areas Exception proposals beyond the one hundred twenty day limit;
