 Physical Description and Related Factors

: The site of these transfers is irregular in shape with broken contours that slope down to the southeast. The southern portion of the subject site, identified as Parcel A on the Attachment B map, is improved with a public roadway (SW City View St.) and the remainder of this Parcel has been used by abutting owners for access to their property. Although SW City View Street is platted immediately south of this property, it appears that for over seventy years (per a 1929 aerial photograph), a paved roadway has been located on this site.

GUIDELINE A: CONSISTENCY

The analysis should consider the purpose for which the property was originally acquired, funding sources used to acquire the property, terms and conditions of original acquisition, the title or deed conveying the property, or any other contract or instrument by which the City is bound or to which the property is subject, and City, state or federal ordinances, statues and regulations.

 The property covered by this legislation and other property was originally acquired for the Duwamish Head Greenbelt and has been held in the Fleets and Facilities Department (FFD) inventory since that time. However, the property was at the time of acquisition already providing public access via the paved roadway. Ordinance 119826, passed by City Council on January 10, 2000, transferred jurisdiction of the wooded, northern portion of the property usable as greenbelt to the Department of Parks and Recreation. At that time, the Department of Parks and Recreation determined that the southern 130 feet of the property was not appropriate for transfer to the Department of Parks and Recreation because of transportation and other street use issues. Subsequently it was determined that the portion used for roadway purposes had been inaccurately described. Thus, there is a need for legislation to amend the legal definition of the property originally transferred from FFD to Department of Parks and Recreation pursuant to Ordinance 119826. Since the property described and depicted as Parcel A on Attachment B has been used for street purposes for over 70 years, the Seattle Department of Transportation Department has agreed to accept jurisdiction over the property. Because the property was acquired by Treasurer's Deed for general municipal purposes, no transfer of funds is required for this action.

 Guideline B: Compatibility and Suitability

The recommendation should reflect an assessment of the potential for use of the property in support of adopted Neighborhood Plans, as or in support of low-income housing, in support of economic development, in support of affordable housing, for park or open space; in support of Sound Transit Link Light Rail station area development; as or in support of child care facilities, and in support of other priorities reflected in adopted City policies.

Context. The property is located north of the platted SW City View Street between SW Admiral Way and 31st Ave SW. Revising the legal description of the property transferred to Department of Parks and Recreation and transferring the jurisdiction to the Seattle Department of Transportation places this street use property under the appropriate department. The transfer will facilitate resolution of access issues from the abutting property owners. The revision will increase the total area of land transferred to Department of Parks and Recreation.

Range of Options. As the property being transferred has continuously been used for street purposes, no other options were investigated. Uses such as housing, park or open space would be negatively impacted by the public roadway crossing the property

 Guideline C: Other Factors

The recommendation should consider the highest and best use of the property, compatibility of the proposed use with the physical characteristics of the property and with surrounding uses,

 timing and term of the proposed use, appropriateness of the consideration to be received, unique attributes that make the property hard to replace, potential for consolidation with adjacent public property to accomplish future goals and objectives, conditions in the real estate market, and known environmental factors that make affect the value of the property.

Highest and Best Use: The property is zoned Single-Family 7200, and could accommodate one building site if it were available for development. However, the property is being dedicated to street use in recognition of its current use as a public roadway, and no appraisal report will be ordered.

Compatibility with surrounding uses: The property is surrounded by primarily single-family houses, with wooded greenbelt to the north and SW Admiral Way to the west. Transferring jurisdiction of the property for street purposes is compatible with surrounding uses and will allow neighborhood street use issues to be addressed by providing abutting owners with access to their property.

Potential for Consolidation with adjacent public property: The other adjacent public properties to the subject are the property under the jurisdiction of the Department of Parks and Recreation and other property acquired for SW Admiral Way under the jurisdiction of Seattle Department of Transportation. As noted, the current condition of this site as a paved roadway and associated neighborhood access does not make it suitable for greenbelt purposes. Consolidation with the property under Seattle Department of Transportation for roadway purposes is the best alternative.

Timing and Term of Proposed Use: Timing of the transfer is not an issue. There is no other proposed use of the site for other than street purposes.

Appropriateness of the consideration: There is to be no consideration given since the property has been used for street purposes and will continue to be used in that manner.

Known environmental factors: There are no known environmental concerns, and no clean-up or other remedial treatment is indicated.

Guideline D: Sale

The recommendation should evaluate the potential for selling the property to non-City public entities and to members of the general public.

 No evaluation for a potential sale for a non-City use was made due to the current use of the property for roadway and neighborhood access purposes.

RECOMMENDATION

The Real Estate Services Division of the Fleets and Facilities Department recommends correction of the legal description of the property transferred to the Department of Parks and Recreation by Ordinance No. 119826 and further recommends that the roadway purpose properties identified herein be transferred from Fleets and Facilities Department to the Seattle Department of Transportation.
