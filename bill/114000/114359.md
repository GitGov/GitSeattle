 WHEREAS, the Director of the Department of Neighborhoods is, pursuant to SMC Section 3.35.060, recommending an increase of P-Patch plot fees effective January 1, 2003 for 2003 and 2004; and

 WHEREAS, SMC Section 3.35.060 should periodically be amended to accurately reflect the current P-Patch plot fees;

 NOW THEREFORE,

 Section 1. Effective January 1, 2003, Seattle Municipal Code Section 3.35.060 is amended as follows:

 SMC 3.35.060 Garden plot fee schedule; permits.

 To partially offset the costs of the P-Patch program, the Director of the Department of Neighborhoods is authorized to establish and collect fees for the use of P-Patch garden plots and to grant revocable permits for such use. Subject to adjustments authorized in this section, fees shall be established in accordance with the size of garden plot used by the program participants and shall be as follows:

 A. Ten (10) foot by ten (10) foot plots, ~~Twenty-three Dollars ($23)~~Twenty-five dollars ($25) per year;

 B. Ten (10) foot by twenty (20) foot plots, ~~Thirty-seven Dollars ($37)~~Thirty-eight dollars ($38) per year;

 C. Ten (10) foot by forty (40) foot plots, ~~Fifty-six Dollars ($56)~~Fifty-eight dollars ($58) per year.

 The Director shall adjust the fees every two (2) years approximately in proportion to the Consumer Price Index, All Urban Consumers, published by the federal government, or a substitute or successor index selected by the Director. The ~~first~~next such adjustment shall take effect January 1, ~~1999~~2005. The Director may establish fees for plots with different dimensions than those set forth above, at a rate per square foot generally consistent with the rate for the standard plot most nearly equal in size, as established under this section. For participants from households with incomes at or below the poverty level as defined by the federal government, the fee for any size plot shall be Five Dollars ($5), subject to cost of living adjustment as stated in this section. The Director may accept a reduced fee from a participant who is given access to a plot after a significant portion of the growing season has expired, prorated to reflect the number of months remaining in the growing season.

 Section 2. This ordinance shall take effect and be in force thirty (30) days from and after its approval by the Mayor, but if not approved and returned by the Mayor within ten (10) days after presentation, it shall take effect as provided by Municipal Code Section 1.04.020.
