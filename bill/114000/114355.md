 C. Hazardous Material Related Permits. Fees for hazardous material related permits are established in Schedule C (See Table 22.602.040 C). In some cases these fees are based on the quantity of hazardous material stored and/or handled at the site and the relative risk posed by each material.

 1. Definitions:

 a. "Quantity Range Number" as established in the Quantity Range Table below, is a number between 1 and 2 which is assigned to a hazard category based upon the amount of hazardous material located at the site.

 QUANTITY RANGE TABLE

 QUANTITY SOLIDS LIQUIDS GASES RANGE (Pounds) (Gallons) (Cu. Ft.) NUMBER

 1 0-550 0-55 0-1,000 1.25 >550 - 5,500 >55 - 550 >1,000 - 5,000 1.5 >5,500 - 27,500 >550 - 2,750 >5,000 - 50,000 1.75 >27,500 - 55,000 >2,750 - 5,500 >50,000 - 100,000 2 >55,000 >5,500 >100,000

 b. "Assigned Risk Factor" as established below, is a number assigned to each hazard class and category of hazardous material indicating the relative hazard posed by materials in that hazard category.

 Hazard Category Assigned Hazard Category Assigned Risk Risk Factor Factor

 Aerosol products 1.3 Liquid petroleum gas 1.4

 Cellulose nitrate 1.3 Magnesium 1.3

 Combustible fiber 1.2 Organic peroxides

 Combustible liquids Unclassified 1.5

 Class II 1.2 Class I 1.4

 Class III-A 1.1 Class II 1.3

 Class III-B 1.1 Class III 1.2

 Compressed gases Class IV 1.1

 Highly toxic 1.5 Oxidizers

 Pyrophoric 1.4 Class 4 1.5

 Flammable 1.4 Class 3 1.4

 Unstable 1.4 Class 2 1.2

 Oxidizing 1.4 Class 1 1.1

 Toxic 1.3 Pyrophoric liquids and 1.3 solids

 Cryogenic 1.3 Radioactives 1.4

 Corrosive 1.3 Toxic liquids and 1.2 solids

 Corrosives 1.1 Unstable (reactive) liquids and solids

 Explosives and blasting 1.5 Class 4 1.5 agents

 Flammable liquids Class 3 1.4

 Class I-A 1.5 Class 2 1.3

 Class I-B 1.4 Class 1 1.2

 Class I-C 1.3 Water-reactive materials

 Flammable solids 1.3 Class 3 1.5

 Highly toxic liquids 1.5 Class 2 1.3 and solids

 Class 1 1.1

 c. "Fixed permit cost" ~~Ninety-eight Dollars ($98.00)~~ One hundred fourteen Dollars ($114.00) is the minimum cost for the Seattle Fire Department to issue a hazardous material permit.

 d. "Base permit fee" is determined by multiplying the sum of the products of the quantity range number and assigned risk factor for each hazard class by the fixed permit cost divided by 1.1 and is represented by the following equation:

 Base permit fee = [( (Q)(R)][F/1.1]

 Where: Q = The quantity range number.

 R = The assigned risk factor.

 F = The fixed permit cost ~~($98.00)~~($114.00).

 Example:

 XYZ Company stores five hundred (500) gallons of gasoline and two hundred (200) pounds of nitric acid. Gasoline is classified as a Class I-B flammable liquid which has an assigned risk factor of 1.4. Nitric acid is classified as a corrosive liquid and a Class 1 oxidizer, both of which have an assigned risk factor of 1.1.

 Base permit fee = [(1.25)(1.4)flammable + (1)(1.1)Class 1 oxidizer][$~~98~~114./1.1]

 Base permit fee = ~~$253.91~~$295.37

When a material has multiple hazards, only the hazard presented by the material that has been assigned the highest risk factor shall be considered.

 One, or a combination of more than one, of the following abbreviations shall be placed before the permit code number to indicate whether the permit applies to storage, retail sales, or use of hazardous materials or is a temporary permit:
