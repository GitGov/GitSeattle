Notes for Default Table 10-5B(2)  1. It is acceptable to use the U-factors in Table 10-5B(2) for all concrete and masonry walls, provided that the grouting is equal to or less than that specified.

 - For ungrouted walls, use the partially-grouted column.

 - For metal studs and z-furring, use the continuous-metal-framing category.

 - For discontinuous metal clips 1 inch square or smaller, use the metal-clip category.

 - For insulation that is attached without any framing members (e.g. glued), use the continuous-insulation-uninterrupted-by-framing category. Continuous insulation may be installed on the interior or exterior of masonry walls, or between stand-alone walls in multi- layer masonry walls, or on the interior or exterior of the concrete.

 2. For Table 10-5B(2), the U-factor includes R-0.17 for exterior air film and R-0.68 for interior air film - vertical surfaces. For insulated walls, the U-factor also includes R-0.45 for 0.5 in. gypsum board. U-factors are provided for the following configurations:

 (a) Concrete wall: 8-in. normal weight concrete wall with a density of 145 lb/ft3.

 (b) Solid grouted concrete block wall: 8-in. medium weight ASTM C90 concrete block with a density of 115 lb/ft3 and solid grouted cores.

 (c) Partially grouted concrete block wall: 8-in. medium weight ASTM C90 concrete block with a density of 115 lb/ft3 having reinforcing steel every 32 in. vertically and every 48 in. horizontally, with cores grouted in those areas only. Other cores are filled with insulating material only if there is no other insulation.

 3. For walls with insulation contained in a framing layer, the U- factors in Table 10-5B(2) assume contact (and thermal bridging) between the mass wall and other framing. For wall assemblies with multiple layers where the wood or metal framing layer does not contact the concrete or masonry layer (i.e. walls with an airspace between the stud wall layer and the mass wall layer), it is acceptable to use the appropriate wood or metal frame wall default U- factors in Tables 10-5 or 10-5A. Note, it is acceptable to use this approach where the insulation extends beyond the framing and is in contact with the mass wall layer (e.g. a nominal four-inch metal stud containing insulation that is nominally six inches thick and therefore extends two inches beyond the back of the metal stud).

 4. Except for wall assemblies qualifying for note 3, if not taken from Table 10-5B(2), mass wall U-factors shall be determined in accordance with ASHRAE/IESNA Standard 90.1-2001, Appendix A, Section A3.1 and Tables A-5 to A-8, or Section A9.4. If not taken from Table 10-9, heat capacity for mass walls shall be taken from ASHRAE/IESNA Standard 90.1-2001, Appendix A, Table A-6 or A-7.

 Section 4. Effective July 1, 2002, Table 10-6 of the Energy Code is amended as follows:

Existing warehouses and repair shops are considered unconditioned space unless they are indicated as conditioned space in DCLU records or they were built after 1980 and they comply with the building envelope requirements for conditioned space in effect at the time of construction. (See the Seattle Mechanical Code for requirements for combustion appliances.)

 b. Any Group R occupancy which is converted to other than a Group R occupancy shall be required to comply with all of the provisions of Sections 1130 through 1132 of this Code.

 Section 8. Effective July 1, 2002, Section 1144 of the Energy Code is amended as follows:

 1144 Violations and Penalties~~:It shall be a violation of this Code for any person, firm, or corporation to erect or construct any building, or remodel or rehabilitate any existing building or structure in the state, or allow the same to be done, contrary to any of the provisions of this Code.~~

 Section 9. Effective July 1, 2002, the Energy Code is amended by adding new Sections 1144.1, 1144.2, 1144.3, 1144.4, 1144.5, 1144.6, and 1144.7 to read as follows:

 1144.1 Violations: It shall be a violation of this Code for any person, firm or corporation to erect, construct, enlarge, repair, move, improve, remove, convert or demolish, equip, occupy, inspect or maintain any building or structure in the City, contrary to or in violation of any of the provisions of this Code.

 It shall be a violation of this Code for any person, firm or corporation to knowingly aid, abet, counsel, encourage, hire, commend, induce or otherwise procure another to violate or fail to comply with this Code.

 It shall be a violation of this Code to for any person, firm, or corporation to use any material or to install any device, appliance or equipment which does not comply with the applicable standards of this Code or which has not been approved by the building official.

 1144.2 Notice of Violation: If after investigation the building official determines that standards or requirements of this code have been violated, the building official may serve a notice of violation upon the owner or other person responsible for the action or condition. The notice of violation shall state the standards or requirements violated, shall state what corrective action, if any, is necessary to comply with the standards or requirements, and shall set a reasonable time for compliance. The notice shall be served upon the owner or other responsible person by personal service, certified mail with return receipt requested or registered mail with return receipt requested or registered mail addressed to the last known address of such person. In addition, a copy o f the notice may be posted at a conspicuous place on the property. The notice of violation shall be considered an order of the building official. Nothing in this subsection shall be deemed to limit or preclude any action or proceeding pursuant to Sections 102, 103 or 104 of the Seattle Building Code, and nothing in this section shall be deemed to obligate or require the building official to issue a notice of violation prior to the imposition of civil or criminal penalties in this section.

 1144.3 Civil Penalties: Any person, firm or corporation failing to comply with the provisions of this code shall be subject to a cumulative civil penalty in an amount not to exceed $500 per day for each violation from the date the violation occurs or begins until compliance is achieved. In cases where the building official has issued a notice of violation, the violation will be deemed to begin, for purposes of determining the number of days of violation, on the date compliance is required by notice of violation. In any civil action for a penalty, the City has the burden of proving by a preponderance of the evidence that a violation exists or existed; the issuance of the notice of violation or of an order following a review by the Director is not itself evidence that a violation exists.

 1144.4 Criminal Penalty: Anyone who violates or fails to comply with any order issued by the building official pursuant to this code or who removes, mutilates, destroys or conceals a notice issued or posted (i.e., affixed to the structure in a conspicuous place) by the building official shall, upon conviction thereof, be punished by a fine of not more than $1,000 or by imprisonment for not more than 360 days, or by both such fine and imprisonment. Each day's violation or failure to comply shall constitute a separate offense.

 Anyone violating or failing to comply with any of the provisions of this code and who within the past five years has had a judgment against them for civil penalties arising from a violation of the building code, shall upon conviction thereof, be fined in a sum not to exceed $500 or by imprisonment for not more than 180 days, or by both such fine and imprisonment. Each day's violation or failure to comply shall constitute a separate offense.

 1144.5 Additional Relief: The building official may seek legal or equitable relief to enjoin any acts or practices and abate any condition which constitutes a violation of this code when civil or criminal penalties are inadequate to effect compliance.

 1144.6 Notices: It shall be unlawful for any person to remove, mutilate, destroy or conceal any notice issued or posted by the building official pursuant to the provisions of this code, or any notice issued or posted by the building official in response to a natural disaster or other emergency.

 The building official may record a copy of any order or notice with the Department of Records and Elections of King County.

 The building official may record with the Department of Records and Elections of King County a notification that a permit has expired without a final inspection after reasonable efforts have been made to provide a final inspection.

 1144.7 Review by the Director

 1144.7.1. Any party affected by a notice of violation issued by the Director pursuant to Section 1144.2 may obtain a review of the notice by requesting such review in writing within fifteen days after service of the notice. When the last day of the period computed is a Saturday, Sunday, federal or City holiday, the period shall run until 5:00 p.m. of the next business day. The request shall be in writing, and upon receipt of the request, the Director shall notify any persons served the notice of violation and the complainant, if any, of the request for review, which shall be within twenty days after the request is received, unless otherwise agreed by all persons served with the notice of violation. Before the deadline for submission of information, any person significantly affected by or interested in the notice of violation (including any persons served the notice of violation and the complainant) may submit any additional information in the form of written material or oral comments to the Director for consideration as part of the review.

 1144.7.2. The review will be made by a representative of the Director who is familiar with the case and the applicable ordinances. The Director's representative will review all additional information received by the deadline for submission of information. The reviewer may also request clarification of information received and a site visit. After review of the additional information, the Director may:

 1. Sustain the notice of violation; or

 2. Withdraw the notice of violation; or

 3. Continue the review to a date certain for receipt of additional information; or

 4. Modify the notice of violation, which may include an extension of the compliance date.

 1144.7.3. The Director shall issue an Order of the Director containing the decision within seven days of the date of the completion of the review, and shall cause the same to be mailed by regular first-class mail to the person or persons named in the notice of violation, mailed to the complainant, if possible, and filed with the Department of Records and Elections of King County.

 Section 10. Effective July 1, 2002, Section 1150 of the Energy Code is amended as follows:

 1150 Conflicts with Other Codes: In case of conflicts among Codes enumerated in RCW 19.27.031 subsections (1), (2), (3) and (4) and this Code, the first named Code shall govern. The duct insulation requirements in this Code or a local jurisdiction's energy code, whichever is more stringent, supersede the requirements in the Uniform Mechanical Code.

This Code is intended to supplement the provisions of the Seattle Building Code, the Seattle Mechanical Code, and the Seattle Electrical Code, and in cases of conflict between this Code and any of those codes, the provisions of those codes shall apply.

Additional efficiency standards for electrical energy use may also appear in Seattle City Light service requirements, which should be consulted.

 Where, in any specific case, different sections of this Code specify different materials, methods of construction or other requirements, the most restrictive shall govern. Where there is a conflict between a general requirement and a specific requirement, the specific requirement shall be applicable.

 Section 11. Effective July 1, 2002, Section 1161 of the Energy Code is amended as follows:

 1161 Severability: If any provision of this Code or its application to any person or circumstance is held invalid, the remainder of this Code or the application of the provision to other persons or circumstances is not affected.

The legislative body hereby declares that it would have passed this Code, and each section, subsection, clause or phrase thereof, irrespective of the fact that any one or more sections, subsections, sentences, clauses, and phrases be declared unconstitutional.

 Section 12. Effective July 1, 2002, Section 1162 of the Energy Code is amended as follows:

 1162 Liability: Nothing contained in this Code is intended to be nor shall be construed to create or form the basis for any liability on the part of ~~any city or county~~the City or its officers, employees or agents for any injury or damage resulting from the failure of a building to conform to the provisions of this Code , or by reason of or in consequence of any inspection, notice, order, certificate, permission of approval authorized or issued or done in connection with the implementation or enforcement of this Code, or by reason of any action or inaction on the part of the City related in any manner to the enforcement of this Code or by its officers or agents. The building official or any employee charged with the enforcement of this Code, acting in good faith and without malice for the City in the discharge of his/her duties, shall not thereby render himself/herself liable personally and he/she is hereby relieved from all personal liability for any damage that may accrue to persons or property as a result of any act required or by reason of any act or omission in the discharge of his/her duties.

 Section 13. Effective July 1, 2002, Section 1301 of the Energy Code is amended as follows:

5. Parking lot attendant booths no larger than 100 square feet, provided that the opaque components comply with the requirements for semi-heated spaces in Section 1310.2. The heating equipment limitations in Section 1310.2 do not apply.

 Section 14. Effective July 1, 2002, Section 1310.2 of the Energy Code is amended as follows:

 1310.2 Semi-Heated Spaces: All spaces shall be considered conditioned spaces, and shall comply with the requirements in Section 1310.1 unless they meet the following criteria for semi-heated spaces. The installed heating equipment output, in Climate Zone 1, shall be 3 Btu/(h ( ft2) or greater but not greater than 8 Btu/(h ( ft2) and in Climate Zone 2, shall be 5 Btu/(h ( ft2) or greater but not greater than 12 Btu/(h ( ft2). Heating shall be controlled by a thermostat mounted not lower than the heating unit and capable of preventing heating above 44 degrees space temperature. ~~For semi-heated spaces, the only prescriptive, component performance or systems analysis building envelope requirement shall be that:~~Climate Zone 1

~~a. U-0.10 maximum for the roof assembly or~~

~~b. continuous R-9 insulation installed entirely outside of the roof structure, or~~

~~c. R-11 insulation installed inside or within a wood roof structure, or~~

g. For fenestration, U-0.90 maximum for vertical glazing and U-1.08 maximum for overhead glazing and a maximum total (vertical and overhead)area equivalent to 10% of the gross wall area.

It is acceptable to combine semi-heated spaces and fully heated spaces in Target UA calculations.

 Section 15. Effective July 1, 2002, Section 1311.6 of the Energy Code is amended as follows:

 1311.6 Radiant Floors (on or below grade): Slab on grade insulation shall extend downward from the top of the slab a minimum distance of 36 inches or downward to the top of the footing and horizontal for an aggregate of not less that 36 inches.

~~If required by the building official where soil conditions warrant such insulation,~~~~t~~The entire area of radiant floor shall be thermally isolated from the soil. Where a soil gas control system is provided below the radiant floor, which results in increased convective flow below the radiant floor, the radiant floor shall be thermally isolated from the sub-floor gravel layer.

 Section 16. Effective July 1, 2002, Section 1312.2 of the Energy Code is amended as follows:

 1312.2 Solar Heat Gain Coefficient and ~~Shading Coefficient~~Visible Transmittance: Solar Heat Gain Coefficient (SHGC) and Visible Transmittance (VT), shall be determined, certified and labeled in accordance with the National Fenestration Rating Council (NFRC) Standard by a certified, independent agency, licensed by the NFRC.

 EXCEPTIONS: 1. Shading coefficients (SC) or solar heat gain coefficient for the center of glass shall be an acceptable alternate for compliance with solar heat gain coefficient requirements. Shading coefficients or solar heat gain coefficient for the center of glass for glazing shall be taken from Chapter ~~29~~30 of Standard RS-27 or from the manufacturer's ~~test~~data using a spectral data file determined in accordance with NFRC 300.

2. For the purposes of 1323, Exception 1, visible transmittance for the center of the glazing assembly shall be taken from Chapter 30 of Standard RS-27 or from the manufacturer's data using a spectral data file determined in accordance with NFRC 300.

Note that using the exception for the SHGC for the center-of- glass does not give the full credit for the overall product (including the frame) that the NFRC-certified SHGC does. Though the SHGC for the frame is not zero (the ASHRAE Handbook of Fundamentals indicates that the SHGC can range from 0.11-0.14 for metal frames and from 0.02-0.07 for wood/vinyl/fiberglass frames), the SHGC for the frame is invariable lower than that for the glass. Consequently, an NFRC-certified SHGC will generally be lower.

Conversely, the VT for the center-of-glass overstates the VT for the overall product (including the frame). The VT for the frame is zero. Consequently, an NFRC-certified VT will always be lower. For this reason, Exception 2 to Section 1312.2 is only applicable to Exception 1 in Section 1323. It is not applicable to other sections.

 { Section 17. Effective July 1, 2002, Section 1322 of the Energy Code is amended as follows:

 1322 Opaque Envelope: Roof/ceilings, opaque exterior walls, opaque doors, floors over unconditioned space, below grade walls, slab on grade floors and radiant floors enclosing conditioned spaces shall be insulated according to Section 1311 and Tables 13-1or 13-2. Compliance with nominal R-values shall be demonstrated for the thermal resistance of the added insulation in framing cavities and/or insulated sheathing only. Nominal R-values shall not include the thermal transmittance of other building materials or air films.

 For metal frame assemblies used in spaces with electric resistance space heat, compliance shall be demonstrated with the component U- factor for the overall assembly based on the assemblies in Chapter 10.

Area-weighted averaging of the R-value is not allowed. When showing compliance with R-values, the minimum insulation R-value for all areas of the component shall comply with Table 13-1. When calculating compliance using U-factors, area-weighted averaging is allowed. Where insulation is tapered (e.g. roofs), separate assembly U-factors shall be calculated for each four-foot section of tapered insulation.

 EXCEPTIONS:

 1. Opaque smoke vents are not required to meet insulation requirements.

 2. For prescriptive compliance only,

a. for glazing areas that are 30% and less of the gross wall area, the insulation of the perimeter edge of an above grade floor slab which penetrates the exterior wall may be reduced to R-5 provided that the glazing U-factor is reduced by U-0.05 below that required in Tables 13-1 and 13-2.

b. for glazing areas that exceed 30% of the gross wall area, the perimeter edge of an above grade floor slab which penetrates the exterior wall may be left uninsulated provided that the glazing U-factor is reduced by U-0.10 below that required in Tables 13-1 and 13-2.((~~The perimeter edge of an above grade floor slab which penetrates the exterior wall may be left uninsulated provided that the wall insulation is increased by R-2 above that required in Tables 13-1 and 13-2.~~

3. For roofs with continuous rigid insulation on the top of the roof, the insulation R-value may be averaged for compliance with minimum prescriptive R-values only, provided that both:

a. the minimum insulation is no less than R-5 (but not including area within 6 inches of each roof drain), and

b. the area-weighted average insulation is R-46 (in lieu of R-30) for electric resistance space heat and R-27 (in lieu of R- 21) for other fuels.

 Section 18. Effective July 1, 2002, Section 1323 of the Energy Code is amended as follows:

 1323 Glazing: Glazing shall comply with Section 1312 and Tables 13- 1 or 13-2. All glazing shall be, at a minimum, double glazing. In addition, all glazing assemblies shall have at least one low- emissivity coating unless the glazing assembly has an overall U- factor that complies with the values in Table 13-1.

 EXCEPTIONS:

 1. Vertical glazing located on the display side of the street level story of a retail occupancy or where there is a street level transparency requirement in the Seattle Land Use Code provided the glazing

 a. (i) is double-glazed with a minimum 1/2 inch airspace and with a low-e coating having a maximum emittance of e-0.40 in any type of frame or

(ii) has an area-weighted U-factor of 0.60 or less.

U-factor calculations shall use overall assembly U-factors. When this exception is used there are no SHGC requirements) and

b. has a visible transmittance of (i) 0.60 or greater for the center of the glazing assembly in any type of frame or (ii) has an area-weighted visible transmittance for the overall assembly including the frame of 0.52 or greater for fixed glazing and 0.44 or greater for operable glazing. Visible transmittance shall be determined in accordance with Section 1312.2, and,

~~b.))~~c. does not exceed 75% of the gross exterior wall area of the display side of the street level story. However, if the display side of the street level story exceeds 20 feet in height, then this exemption may only be used for the first 20 feet of that story.

 When this exception is utilized, separate calculations shall be performed for these sections of the building envelope and these values shall not be averaged with any others for compliance purposes. The 75% area may be exceeded on the street level, if the additional glass area is provided from allowances from other areas of the building.

 Section 33. Effective July 1, 2002, the Energy Code is amended by adding a new Section 1413.5 to read as follows:

 1413.5 Economizer Heating System Impact: Any HVAC system that increases the building heating energy use during economizer operation is not allowed (e.g. single-fan/dual-duct systems and multizone systems).

 EXCEPTIONS:

 1. Where the heating is allowed by Section 1435.

 2. Water source heat pump systems that comply with Section 1433, Exception 2.

 Note that single-fan/dual-duct systems and multizone systems do not comply with this requirement. This is because economizer operation lowers the temperature of the air entering the hot deck heating coil, increasing its energy use. In order to use this type of system, a water economizer must be used, or the system must meet one of the economizer exceptions and have neither type of economizer. (Another resolution is to use a dual-fan/dual-duct system where the hot deck fan supplies only return air or return air plus minimum ventilation air.)

 This requirement will not affect three-deck multizone since they cannot work with an air economizer in any case (it would make the neutral deck a cold deck).

 An exception to the heating impact is provided for economizers on VAV systems that cause zone level heating to increase due to a reduction in supply air temperature. Reducing supply air temperatures on a cooling-VAV system will reduce fan energy (particularly if the system has a variable speed drive), offsetting the energy lost due to increased reheat energy.

 See the discussion and diagrams of Section 6.3.1.4 of ASHRAE/IESNA Standard 90.1 in the Users Manual.

 Section 34. Effective July 1, 2002, Section 1414.1 of the Energy Code is amended as follows:

Ductwork shall be sealed using welds, gaskets, mastic, or mastic-plus-embedded-fabric tape. Enclosed stud bays or joist cavities/spaces used to transport air shall be sealed using mastic-plus-embedded-fabric tape or, when drywall is used to enclose the air system, drywall mud and tape. Duct tape is not permitted as a sealant on any ducts.

EXCEPTION: Fibrous glass duct systems installed in accordance with standard UL 181A and flexible duct systems installed in accordance with standard UL 181B may use tapes listed for these systems.

Note that longitudinal seams are joints oriented in the direction of airflow. Transverse joints are connections of two duct sections oriented perpendicular to airflow.

 d. Any higher rate that can be demonstrated, to the satisfaction of the building official, to reduce overall system annual energy usage by offsetting reheat/recool energy losses through a reduction in outdoor air intake in accordance with the multiple space requirements defined in ASHRAE Standard 62.

 2. Zones where special pressurization relationships, cross- contamination requirements, or code required minimum circulation rates are such that variable air volume systems are impractical.

 3. Zones where at least 75% of the energy for reheating or for providing warm air in mixing systems is provided from a site- recovered (including condenser heat) or site-solar energy source.

 3. Constant volume may be used in zones where pressurization relationships must be maintained by code. Where constant volume is used, the system shall have heat recovery if required by Section 1436. VAV shall be used in all other areas, in accordance with Sections 1432 through 1439.

 4. Provide run-around heat recovery systems for all fan systems with a minimum outside air intake greater than 70%. Recovery effectiveness shall be 0.50.

 5. If a warehouse is not intended to be mechanically cooled, both the standard and proposed designs shall be calculated assuming no mechanical cooling.

 6. The system listed is for guest rooms only. Areas such as public areas and back-of-house areas shall be served by system 4. Other areas such as offices and retail shall be served by systems listed in Table 3-3 for these occupancy types.

 7. The system listed is for guest rooms only. Areas such as public areas and back-of- house areas shall be served by system 5. Other areas such as offices and retail shall be served by systems listed in Table 3-3 for these occupancy types.

 8. Reserved.

 9. Reserved.

 10. Design supply air circulation rate shall be based on a supply-air to room-air temperature difference of 20(F. A higher supply-air temperature may be used if required to maintain a minimum circulation rate of 4.5 air changes per hour or 15 cfm per person to each zone served by the system, at design conditions. If return fans are specified, they shall be sized for the supply fan capacity less the required minimum ventilation with outside air, or 75% of the supply fan capacity, whichever is larger. Except where noted, supply and return fans shall be operated continuously during occupied hours.

 11. Fan energy when included in the efficiency rating of the unit as defined in Section 1411, need not be modeled explicitly for this system. The fan shall cycle with calls for heating or cooling.

 12. Chilled water systems shall be modeled using a reciprocating chiller for systems with total cooling capacities less than 175 tons, and centrifugal chillers for systems with cooling capacities of 175 tons or greater. For systems with cooling capacities of 600 tons or more, the standard design energy consumption shall be calculated using two centrifugal chillers, lead/lag controlled. Chilled water shall be assumed to be controlled at a constant 44(F. Chiller water pumps shall be sized using a 12(F temperature rise, from 44(F to 56(F, operating at 65% combined impeller and motor efficiency. Condenser water pumps shall be sized using a 10(F temperature rise, operating at 60% combined impeller and motor efficiency. The cooling tower shall be an open circuit, centrifugal blower type sized for the larger of 85(F leaving water temperature or 10(F approach to design wetbulb temperature. The tower shall be controlled to provide a 65(F leaving water temperature whenever weather conditions permit, floating up to design leaving water temperatures at design conditions. Chilled water supply temperature shall be reset in accordance with Section 1432.2.2.

 13. Hot water system shall include a natural draft fossil fuel or electric boiler. The hot water pump shall be sized based on a 30(F temperature drop, from 180(F to 150(F, operating at a combined impeller and motor efficiency of 60%. Hot water supply temperature shall be reset in accordance with Section 1432.2.2.

Section 77. As part of the regular code review cycle that is expected to be completed in 2004, staff from the Department of Design, Construction and Land Use and City Light will work in a timely manner with industry stakeholders and other interested parties to determine whether the changes to RS-29 implemented in this legislation have had their intended consequences. And further, whether there are additional modifications to the Energy Code that could achieve the joint goals of providing design flexibility, encouraging innovation and promoting energy conservation, or whether innovation is better promoted through other mechanisms.
