 3.1 Approval of Construction. Sound Transit shall obtain the approval of the Director of Seattle Transportation of all Light Rail Transit Facility Final Construction Plans for work in the Public Rights of Way prior to any such work commencing. When approving Final Construction Plans for Light Rail Transit Facilities, including Light Rail Transit Stations, transit station access and supporting passenger service amenities, the Director may impose conditions to ensure consistency with the Seattle Design Guidelines for Link Light Rail to be developed by the City and Sound Transit. Final Construction Plans must be accompanied by Final Right-of-Way Plans. Approval for construction shall consist of the issuance of a construction permit or permits by Seattle Transportation, for each project section or contract to be constructed by Sound Transit within the Public Rights of Way. Approval for construction shall not be given until the Director has received satisfactory evidence that the applicant has obtained sufficient funding (which might include a Full Funding Grant Agreement with a federal agency) to complete the work described in the Final Construction Plans.

 3.4 Temporary Use of Public Rights of Way. During construction of the Light Rail Transit System, Sound Transit, with the prior written agreement of the City, may fence portions of the Public Rights of Way for the temporary storage of construction equipment and materials, provided that such structures and fences (i) do not interfere with or disrupt in any way, other than in ways approved in advance by the City, the ordinary use of the right of way; ~~and~~ (ii) do not interfere with or disrupt in any way, other than in ways approved in advance by the City, the ordinary access to property on either side of the Public Rights of Way; (iii) are not used for construction worker parking; and (iv) do not unnecessarily limit the public's right to travel within the right of way. Sound Transit shall not store or temporarily place any goods, materials, or equipment (i) near a roadway, intersection, or crossing in such a manner as to interfere with the sight distance of persons approaching such crossing; or (ii) within such greater distance as prohibited by the City; provided, however, that fuel and other hazardous substances shall not be stored unless approved by appropriate officials of the Seattle Fire Department.

 3.11 Information Regarding Ongoing Work. In addition to providing notice to the public of ongoing work as may be required under applicable law, Sound Transit shall:

 G. Work with affected business owners, chambers of commerce, merchants associations and others, including minority businesses, to develop a business-marketing program to minimize business disruption during construction. The program could include a shuttle bus and/or increased transit service to affected areas, additional signage, advertising and promotion, and incentives to attract and retain customers.

 H. Request the assistance of local ethnic and minority community organizations to help tailor business-marketing programs to the specific needs of ethnic business owners whose customers are mainly from a single ethnic group.

 I. Work with Community Capital Development and/or similar organizations to assist affected businesses, including minority businesses, in gaining access to technical assistance and small business loans or grants.
