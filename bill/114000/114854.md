 AN ORDINANCE relating to the Lake City Civic Core project; transferring jurisdiction over certain City property among the Department of Parks and Recreation, The Seattle Public Library, and the Fleets and Facilities Department; and finding such transfers meet the requirements of Ordinance 118477.

 WHEREAS, the Seattle Public Library (Library), the Fleets and Facilities Department (FFD), and the Department of Parks and Recreation (Parks), are jointly developing and will thereafter independently manage the several components of the Lake City Civic Core project, consisting of an expanded Lake City library and neighborhood service center; a plaza and parking garage; and a redesigned Albert Davis Park, all located in Block 7, Kenwood Division No. 2, as depicted in the Lake City Civic Core site plan attached to this ordinance; and

 WHEREAS, the boundaries of the existing Library and park do not align with the proposed boundaries of those project elements; and

 WHEREAS, in order to achieve the objectives of the development, jurisdiction over certain property previously acquired by FFD must be transferred to Parks for the redeveloped Albert Davis Park; jurisdiction over property currently held by Parks must be transferred to the Library for its servicing area; and jurisdiction over Library property must be transferred to FFD for the future plaza and parking garage; and
