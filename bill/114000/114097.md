 AN ORDINANCE relating to the City Light Department; authorizing the Superintendent or his designee to enter into agreements with the Bonneville Power Administration related to electric energy conservation.

 WHEREAS, City Light has contracted to purchase power from the Bonneville Power Administration (BPA) to meet a portion of its electric load, and BPA forecasts it must acquire power resources to augment the output of the Federal Columbia River Power System to meet all of its contractual obligations; and

 WHEREAS, the Pacific Northwest Electric Power Planning and Conservation Act (the "Regional Act") gives first priority to conservation as the resource to meet BPA's electric needs, and BPA is again interested in acquiring cost-effective conservation from its customer utilities; and

 WHEREAS, since the 1970's City Light's conservation efforts have been the pre-eminent program in the Northwest and nationally recognized as a model for achieving documentable cost-effective energy savings; and

 WHEREAS, pursuant to Resolution 30144 (the "Earth Day 2000 Resolution") City Light asked the Pacific Northwest Electric Power and Conservation Planning Council to assess the remaining conservation potential in the City Light service territory, leading to doubling City Light's annual conservation goal, the increased costs of which were included in the 2002 Adopted Budget for City Light; and

 WHEREAS, BPA has agreed to help fund some of those costs in exchange for City Light reducing the amount of power it will buy from BPA due to those conservation accomplishments, thereby reducing the amount of power BPA will have to acquire from other sources, benefiting both City Light ratepayers and the environment; Now Therefore,

 BE IT ORDAINED BY THE CITY OF SEATTLE AS FOLLOWS:

 Section 1. The Superintendent of the City Light Department, or his designee, is hereby authorized to enter into conservation agreements with the Bonneville Power Administration substantially in the forms attached to this ordinance, and to accept monies received under those agreements into the Light Fund. Attachment 1 is the Purchase of Conservation Agreement under which BPA will pay City Light for the actual amount of conservation activities completed by City Light's conservation programs up to $26.66 million. Attachment 2 is the Block Power Purchase Reduction Agreement to reduce City Light's purchase of power from BPA by the amount of energy expected to be saved by the conservation programs.

 Section 2. Any act taken in furtherance of this ordinance prior to its effective date is hereby ratified and confirmed.

 Section 3. This ordinance shall take effect and be in force thirty (30) days from and after its approval by the Mayor, but if not approved and returned by the Mayor within ten (10) days after presentation, it shall take effect as provided by Municipal Code Section 1.04.020.
