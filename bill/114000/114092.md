 ORDINANCE __________

 AN ORDINANCE relating to the City Light Department; authorizing the Superintendent to enter into three long-term contracts with Public Utility District No. 2 of Grant County to enable City Light to continue to purchase output from the Priest Rapids Project on the Columbia River.

 WHEREAS, Seattle currently purchases eight percent of the output of the Priest Rapids Dam from Grant County PUD under a 50-year contract entered into in 1956; and

 WHEREAS, Seattle's purchase power contract with Grant County PUD will expire on October 31, 2005; and

 WHEREAS, Grant County PUD has advised the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission that it intends to seek a relicense for the Priest Rapids Project (consisting of both the Priest Rapids and Wanapum dams); and

 WHEREAS, Grant County PUD and the other power purchases have been discussing terms of a proposed contract renewal over the past ten years; and

 WHEREAS, litigation arising over the 1956 contract terms has resulted in trial court rulings establishing the right of Grant County PUD to offer terms of a new contract prior to the expiration date of the old contracts and upholding Grant's right to require on a non-compete clause providing for support of Grant's relicensing efforts; and

 WHEREAS, Grant County PUD has negotiated improvements in the original contract offer to accommodate Seattle's particular issues relating to Seattle having been a purchaser of output from only the Priest Rapids dam rather than both the Priest Rapids and Wanapum dams; and

 WHEREAS, Grant County PUD has indicated its desire to accommodate environmental and tribal concerns in its relicensing effort; and

 WHEREAS, Grant County PUD has also encouraged Seattle to provide it and any other interested party with any suggestions to improve the license application in both its environmental and tribal aspects as the relicensing process proceeds; Now, Therefore,

 BE IT ORDAINED BY THE CITY OF SEATTLE AS FOLLOWS:

 Section 1. The Superintendent of the City Light Department is hereby authorized to enter into a long-term contact with Public Utility District No. 2 of Grant County, entitled, "Priest Rapids Project Product Sales Contract," substantially in the form of the contract attached to this ordinance. The Product Sales Contract gives Seattle the right to a proportional share of the seventy percent output of the Priest Rapids Project that was previously apportioned to the new licensee by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission in proceedings that determined the meaning of PL 83-554 as applied to relicensing. The amount of power allocated to Seattle under this contract will be determined by an allocation among all of the other long-term power purchasers, as described in the agreement, which allocation will decline as Grant PUD's local service load increases.

 Section 2. The Superintendent of the City Light Department is further authorized to enter into a long-term contact with Public Utility District No. 2 of Grant County, entitled, "Priest Rapids Project Reasonable Portion Power Sales Contract," substantially in the form of the contract attached to this ordinance. The Reasonable Portion contract provides for City Light to acquire a percentage of the proceeds of the sale for the remaining 30 percent of the project output, designated by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission as the "reasonable portion" of the project that must be offered for sale by Grant PUD at market prices.

 Section 3. The Superintendent of the City Light Department is further authorized to enter into a long-term contact with Public Utility District No. 2 of Grant County, entitled, "Additional Products Sales Agreement," substantially in the form of the contract attached to this ordinance. This additional contract provides City Light with the opportunity to purchase a share of Grant PUD's non-firm generation from the project at a rate equal to the average annual power cost.

 Section 4. The Superintendent of the City Light Department is also authorized to agree to modifications to these contracts that are made necessary by the requirement to accommodate other purchasers of the Priest Rapids Project output, or to accommodate license conditions that the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission may impose upon relicensing.

 Section 5. Any acts taken in furtherance of this ordinance prior to its effective date are hereby ratified and confirmed.

 Section 6. This ordinance shall take effect and be in force thirty (30) days from and after its approval by the Mayor, but if not approved and returned by the Mayor within ten (10) days after presentation, it shall take effect as provided by Municipal Code Section 1.04.020.

 SECTION 3. PRIEST RAPIDS PROJECT PRODUCTS AND PURCHASER PRODUCT PERCENTAGES; REGULATORY APPROVALS.

 Upon execution of this contract, Purchaser shall select a Purchaser Product Percentage for each of the Priest Rapids Project Products described below; provided, however, that Purchaser must select a Purchaser Product Percentage of Surplus Product other than zero in order to select Purchaser Product Percentage for Displacement Product. Each of the Purchaser Product Percentages selected may be a different percentage, and the Purchaser Product Percentages for Displacement Product may be zero.

 (a) SURPLUS PRODUCT. The District desires to market Priest Rapids Project Output that is surplus to its needs. To minimize the volatility of such marketing and in order to achieve stable retail rates, the District desires to market this surplus in a manner that the Purchaser assumes the uncertainty of future Priest Rapids Project Output, costs and market prices. To accomplish these objectives the District believes that the price for the Surplus Product should be at cost.

 The District shall sell to the Purchaser and the Purchaser shall purchase 6.14 percent of Surplus Product ("Purchaser Product Percentage of Surplus Product"). The amount and cost of the Surplus Product is defined in Sections 5 and 6, respectively.

 (b) DISPLACEMENT PRODUCT. The District desires to enhance its success in obtaining a New FERC License by making available to other electric utilities in the Pacific Northwest benefits that would not otherwise be possible but for the Priest Rapids Project. For this purpose, the District may, pursuant to this contract, offer the Purchaser Priest Rapids Project Output that otherwise would be used by the District to meet Estimated District Loads but for capacity and energy acquired by the District from Displacement Resources.

 The District shall sell to the Purchaser and the Purchaser shall purchase 0 percent of Displacement Product ("Purchaser Product Percentage of Displacement Product"). The amount and cost of Displacement Product is defined in Sections 5 and 6, respectively. The Displacement Product does not entail the resale of federal power available to the District.

 By notification to the District by October 1, 2005, the Purchaser may elect to have the District market the Purchaser Product Percentage of the Displacement Product pursuant to a supplementary agreement between the Purchaser and the District. The District will assign to the Purchaser the cost incurred by the District in marketing such Displacement Product.

 The District may at its discretion seek a resource to extend the availability of the capacity and energy identified in Exhibit A beyond 2011 ("Replacement Contract"). If the District has determined to not seek a Replacement Contract, nevertheless upon the request of the Purchaser and after execution of an agreement or agreements ("Supplemental Displacement Product Agreement") by the District and all requesting Purchasers setting forth the term of the Replacement Contract, the product to be purchased, and the obligation of requesting Purchasers to pay the District an amount equal to any and all costs, charges, surcharges and penalties payable under such Replacement Contract, the District will use reasonable efforts to obtain a Replacement Contract. If such a Replacement Contract is obtained, an amount equal to the capacity and energy available thereunder will be offered to the Purchaser pursuant to the terms of this contract as the Displacement Product, subject to the terms of any Supplemental Displacement Product Agreement.

 (c) REALLOCATION. If collectively Purchasers subscribe to Purchaser Product Percentages for any Priest Rapids Project Product that total more than 100%, either initially or at any time before the time limits set forth in Section 1(d), then Purchaser Product Percentages for such Priest Rapids Project Product will be determined as follows; provided, however, that the application of the following formula shall not result in the Purchaser being assigned a Purchaser Product Percentage larger than that included in this contract on the date of execution:

 (1) Step 1. Each such Priest Rapids Project Product will be divided between parties to the 1956 and 1959 Contracts, as a group, and the Idaho Cooperatives, as a group, in proportion to the number of retail electric customers located in the Pacific Northwest (determined by the number of retail meters) served by each group as of October 31, 2000.

 (2) Step 2. Each Purchaser Product Percentage of such Priest Rapids Project Product will be determined as follows:

 (A) For parties to the 1956 and 1959 Contracts, the proportion of such Priest Rapids Project Product from Step 1 above will be distributed to individual Purchasers as follows:

 (i) For November 1, 2005 through October 31, 2009 the Surplus Product shall be distributed in proportion to participation in the 1956 Contract and the Displacement Product shall be distributed in proportion to participation in the 1956 Contract and 1959 Contract weighted 25% and 75%, respectively.

 (ii) For the period after November 1, 2009 the Surplus Product and Displacement Product shall be distributed in proportion to the sum of participation in the 1956 Contract and 1959 Contract divided by two.

 (iii) Notwithstanding any other provision of this contract, for those Eligible Purchasers that sign this contract after December 31, 2001, the Purchaser Product Percentage for the Surplus Product and the Displacement Product may not exceed the average of the Purchaser's Power Allocations, as those terms are defined in the 1956 and 1959 Contracts, divided by 63.5 percent.

 (iv) Notwithstanding any other provision of this contract, for those Eligible Purchasers that sign this contract after October 31, 2005, their participation in the Priest Rapids Development shall be deemed to be zero for purposes of determining their Purchaser Product Percentage for the Surplus Product and the Displacement Product under this contract.

 (B) For the Idaho Cooperatives, the proportion of such Priest Rapids Project Product from Step 1 will be distributed to individual cooperatives in proportion to the number of retail electric customers located in the Pacific Northwest (determined by number of retail meters) each cooperative served as of October 31, 2000.

 (d) If the reallocation procedure of Section 3(c) is implemented, then for the period November 1, 2005 through October 31, 2009, the following shall apply to those Purchasers who were parties to the 1956 Contracts but were not parties to the 1959 Contracts:

 (1) The Purchaser Product Percentage of Displacement Product shall be adjusted to be in proportion to participation in the 1956 Contract (the Purchaser's percent participation in the 1956 Contract divided by 63.5%).

 (2) The District shall be obligated to provide the Displacement Product pursuant to Section 5 using the Purchaser Product Percentage of Displacement Product as calculated pursuant to Section 3(d)(1), and the Purchaser shall be obligated to make payments for the Displacement Product pursuant to Sections 6 and 7 using such Purchaser Product Percentage of Displacement Product.

 The adjustments to Purchaser Product Percentage of Displacement Product will have no effect on the Purchaser Product Percentage of any other Product hereunder, nor on the Purchaser Product Percentage of any other Purchaser.

 (e) If a Contract with one of the Purchasers is terminated pursuant to Section 22 as a result of such Purchaser's Act of Default, the District shall give the non-defaulting Purchasers notice of such default. Beginning with the first month that is at least 30 days following such notice, the Purchaser Product Percentages of Surplus and Displacement Products (other than zero) of non-defaulting Purchasers shall be increased pro rata until either: (i) the Purchaser Product Percentages of Surplus and Displacement Products of the defaulting Purchaser have been fully allocated or (ii) a further pro rata increase to the Purchaser Product Percentages of Surplus and Displacement Products of the non-defaulting Purchasers would adversely affect the tax-exempt status of any outstanding Debt. In the event of (ii), the portion of the Purchaser Product Percentages of Surplus and Displacement Products of the defaulting Purchaser not yet allocated will be offered to all Purchasers that can accept such allocation without adversely affecting the tax-exempt status of any outstanding Debt. If after such offer there remains some portion of the Purchaser Product Percentages of Surplus and Displacement Products of the defaulting Purchaser not yet allocated, the District at its discretion may elect to accept such unallocated portion. If after all of the foregoing there remains unallocated Purchaser Product Percentages of Surplus and Displacement Products of the defaulting Purchaser, the Purchaser Product Percentages of Surplus and Displacement Products (other than zero) of non-defaulting Purchasers shall be increased pro rata based on each such non- defaulting Purchaser's Purchaser Product Percentages of Surplus and Displacement Products before any allocation under this Section 3(e). In the event that the allocation described in the immediately preceding sentence adversely affects the tax-exempt status of Debt, any increased costs resulting therefrom will be included in Annual Power Costs. Nothing in this subsection is intended to limit any claims the non-defaulting Purchasers may assert against the defaulting Purchaser.

 (f) REGULATORY APPROVALS. The District and the Purchaser believe that this contract fully complies with the requirements of Public Law 83-544. FERC has ordered that a Reasonable Portion of the Priest Rapids Project Output be offered for sale based on market principles and that Eligible Purchasers are to receive a meaningful priority. Additionally, FERC has stated that the District may negotiate power contracts as part of the license application process provided that implementation of such contracts is contingent on receipt of license authority. The District and the Purchaser agree that nothing in this contract limits in any way the District's ability to conform to these FERC requirements. Nothing in this contract, other than Section 8, limits the ability of the Purchaser from participating in any FERC or court proceedings that may address Public Law 83-544.

 The Parties understand that FERC's orders of February 11, 1998 and June 12, 1998 in Docket No. EL95-35 (the "PL 83-544 Orders") require the District, as part of its application for a New FERC License, to file the Marketing Plan for making available the Reasonable Portion in a fair, equitable and non-discriminatory manner pursuant to market-based principles and procedures. The Parties further understand and agree that nothing in this contract is intended to affect or limit in anyway the right of the District to develop and file the Marketing Plan which it determines is consistent with the PL 83-544 Orders.

 In the event that FERC or a court of competent jurisdiction shall by order determine that any provision of this contract violates a requirement of either PL 83-544 or of any of the PL 83-544 Orders, the Parties shall, within 30 days of the entry of such an order, commence negotiations for the purpose of reaching agreement on such amendments to this contract, if any, as may be needed for the purpose of complying with that order and for the purpose of preserving the basic benefits and obligations of the Parties. If, within 90 days of commencement of negotiations, the Parties are not able to resolve their differences and to agree upon any necessary amendments, either Party may, after notice to the other Party, cause the matter to be submitted to binding arbitration as provided in Section 28.

 If following the issuance of the arbitration decision, a Party reasonably determines that acceptance of such amendments will result in materially decreased benefits or materially increased obligations when compared to this contract, the Party may by notice to the other Party explain its reasons for the determination and, if given within 10 days of the arbitration decision, terminate this contract.

 SECTION 4. TREATMENT OF THE SALE OF THE REASONABLE PORTION.

 Pursuant to the PL 83-544 Orders, the Reasonable Portion must be offered for sale. Purchaser has no claim or right under this contract to receive any of the Reasonable Portion, or any proceeds from the sale thereof; provided, however, that nothing in this contract shall be interpreted as prohibiting the District and the Purchaser from entering one or more separate agreements regarding the Reasonable Portion and the disposition of the proceeds of the sale of the Reasonable Portion.

 SECTION 5. DETERMINATION OF PRODUCT AVAILABILITY, DISTRICT RESERVED SHARE AND RISK PREMIUM.

 (a) The Priest Rapids Project Products available to Purchaser during each Contract Year will be determined by the sequential application of the following provisions of this Section 5 (i.e., Section 5(b), then Section 5(c), then Section 5(d), etc.).

 (b) For the purpose of determining the estimated amount of Surplus Product to be made available to the Purchaser, on or before 30 days prior to the beginning of each Contract Year, the District shall prepare and mail to the Purchaser a pro forma statement showing for the next Contract Year:

 (1) "Estimated District Loads," which shall mean all projected retail electric energy loads for the next Contract Year based on average weather conditions, plus aggregated losses, projected to be used at locations served by the District during the next Contract Year with the exception of (i) locations outside of the geographic boundaries shown on Exhibit C and (ii) that portion of loads of individual retail customers that during a consecutive 12 month period after 2000 exceed by ten average megawatts or more the energy load of such customer for the immediately preceding consecutive 12 month period. Once load at a location is included in Estimated District Loads, loads at such location shall continue to be included in full in future Contract Years without regard to the source of supply for such load. For example, if a load is expected to be served in all or part by an entity other than the District during the next Contract Year, the entire load shall continue to be included in Estimated District Loads. If a new load or increased load of one average megawatt or more at a single retail customer has been included in Estimated District Loads in the current Contract Year, and less than 90% of such new or increased load was actually measured in the current year, then Estimated District Loads shall be reduced for the next Contract Year by the difference between the amount included in the current Contract Year and the amount measured. If there are more than one such new or increased loads for the current Contract Year, they shall be combined for determining both the 90% and the amount of any reduction. If in the current Contract Year a load of one average megawatt or more is placed on the District which was not included in the current Contract Year's Estimated District Loads, then the next Contract Year's Estimated District Loads shall be increased by the amount of such load measured in the current Contract Year. Except for such load correction calculations, Estimated District Loads for the next Contract Year shall be not less than the current Contract Year's Estimated District Loads.

 (2) Estimated amount of firm energy from the Priest Rapids Project for the next Contract Year based on critical water planning using the procedures of Operating Agreements in effect on October 31, 2000, unless the District and Purchasers whose Purchaser Product Percentages of Surplus Product total 66% or more mutually agree to use procedures from a subsequent Operating Agreement.

 (3) The "District Reserved Share" for the next Contract Year shall be: (A) prior to November 1, 2009, the smaller of: (i) the ratio of Estimated District Loads from Section 5(b)(1) less the District's 36.5% of the estimated firm energy output of the Wanapum Development, to the estimated firm energy output of the Priest Rapids Development from Section 5(b)(2), expressed as a percentage or (ii) 100% minus the Reasonable Portion; and (B) on and after November 1, 2009, the smaller of: (i) the ratio of Estimated District Loads from Section 5(b)(1) to the estimated firm energy output of the Priest Rapids Project from Section 5(b)(2), expressed as a percentage or (ii) 100% minus the Reasonable Portion.

 (4) The "Purchaser Power Allocation" shall be the product of: (i) 100% minus the sum of the District Reserved Share as determined in Section 5(b)(3) and the Reasonable Portion and (ii) the Purchaser Product Percentage of the Surplus Product.

 (c) During each Contract Year, the District shall have available for its use and shall take the District Reserved Share multiplied by the actual Priest Rapids Project Output. The District shall have the unilateral right, without obligation to the Purchaser, to use Priest Rapids Project Output resulting from the District Reserved Share for any purpose. In no event shall the Purchaser have any right under this contract to any portion of the District Reserved Share of Priest Rapids Project Output or the associated revenues. The District may use the District Reserved Share of the non-firm portion of the actual output of the Priest Rapids Project in any manner the District deems appropriate, and shall have no obligation to use such non-firm portion to serve the District's retail loads during any Contract Year.

 (d) The Surplus Product available to the Purchaser in each Contract Year shall be the actual Priest Rapids Project Output multiplied by the Purchaser Power Allocation from Section 5(b)(4).

 (e) For the purpose of determining the estimated amount of Displacement Product to be made available to the Purchaser, on or before 30 days prior to the beginning of each Contract Year, the District shall prepare and mail the Purchaser a pro forma statement showing for the next Contract Year the estimated amount of capacity and energy from Displacement Product.

 (f) The monthly amount of "Estimated Unmet District Load" shall be determined as the Estimated District Load as calculated in Section 5(b)(1), less the estimated firm Priest Rapids Project Output from Section 5(b)(2). The difference so determined will be shaped on a monthly basis using the District's historic load patterns.

 (g) In those Contract Years when there is Estimated Unmet District Load forecasted pursuant to Section 5(f), the District shall be entitled to take and shall take from the Displacement Product that is not subject to a Supplemental Displacement Product Agreement pursuant to Section 3(b) an amount equal to the Estimated Unmet District Load from Section 5(f).

 (h) The Purchaser shall have available for its use and shall take Displacement Product equal to the actual Displacement Resource available during the Contract Year minus the amount of Displacement Resource used by the District in such Contract Year as determined in Section 5(g), multiplied by the Purchaser Product Percentage of Displacement Product; provided, however, if the Purchaser has elected to have the District make sales pursuant to Section 3(b), then Purchaser will receive proceeds from such sales as set forth in Section 10 in lieu of the amounts of capacity and energy described in this Section 5(h).

 (i) On or before 30 days prior to the beginning of each Contract Year, the District shall prepare and mail the Purchaser a pro forma statement showing for the next Contract Year an estimate of the Purchaser Risk Premium to be paid by the Purchaser, using a Risk Premium calculated with a Market Price determined by the District not more than 60 days prior to the start of the next Contract Year by reference to published future price data for the next Contract Year, and the applicable percentage from Section 7(a)(5).

 (j) Deliveries of Priest Rapids Project Products may be reduced if the District does not obtain an Annual FERC License or New FERC License, or under any of the following conditions as determined by the District:

 (1) Pursuant to Sections 5 or 9.

 (2) If the District is unable to deliver Priest Rapids Project Products to the Purchaser due to Uncontrollable Forces.

 (3) If failure to reduce deliveries, together with deliveries to all other Purchasers and deliveries to the District, would result in exceeding the capability of the Priest Rapids Project or subject it or its operation to undue hazard or violate the FERC License, any applicable law, regulation, or Operating Agreement.

 (4) In case of emergencies or in order to install equipment in, make repairs to, make betterments, renewals, replacements, and additions to ("Improvements"), investigations and inspections of, or perform other maintenance work on the Priest Rapids Project.

 The District will use its reasonable efforts to give advance notice to the Purchaser regarding any planned interruption or reduction, giving the reason therefor and stating the probable duration thereof.

 (k) Notwithstanding any other Section of this contract, if the Priest Rapids Project is capable of producing Priest Rapids Project Output, but the amount of each Priest Rapids Project Product to be made available to the Purchaser is projected to be zero for a Contract Year, the Purchaser may give the District written notice, no later than 100 days after the start of the Contract Year, that the Purchaser elects to terminate this contract. In such event, this contract shall terminate effective upon receipt of such written notice by the District.

 SECTION 6. ANNUAL POWER COSTS.

 (a) "Annual Power Costs" as used in this contract shall include, for the Priest Rapids Development beginning November 1, 2005 and for the Priest Rapids Project beginning November 1, 2009, all of the District's costs and expenses of every type, both direct and indirect, resulting from the ownership, operation, maintenance of and Improvements that are incurred or paid by the District during each Contract Year and that are incurred consistent with Prudent Utility Practice. Such costs and expenses shall for any Contract Year include, but not be limited to the following, in each case without duplication:

 (1) All operations costs, maintenance costs, administrative costs, taxes, in lieu of tax payments relating to production and delivery of Priest Rapids Project Output (excluding depreciation) including, but not limited to, those specified in the Uniform System of Accounts as prescribed by the FERC for electric utilities and licensees.

 (2) Amounts that the District determines are needed to pay for the prevention or correction of any loss or damage and for Improvements to keep the Priest Rapids Project in good operating condition. Subject to Section 28, the Purchaser agrees that the District shall have the sole right to determine what costs and expenses shall be incurred in connection with the ownership, operation, and maintenance of and Improvements to the Priest Rapids Project.

 (3) Subject to Section 6(e), interest that accrues and is payable into the debt service fund with respect to outstanding Debt; principal that accrues and is payable into the debt service fund with respect to outstanding Debt, whether at maturity or by reason of redemption (including premiums for redeeming Debt prior to its scheduled maturity), amounts required to restore any reserve accounts maintained to secure Debt to the level required by the resolution authorizing the Debt and Financing Costs. "Financing Costs" include, but are not limited to, discounts, insurance premiums, letter of credit fees, costs of hedging interest rates, costs of compliance with disclosure requirements, legal and bond counsel fees, independent auditors, printing, financial advisor, bond registrar and trustee costs.

 (4) Subject to Section 6(e), costs of creating and replenishing any reserve or contingency fund required to be maintained by any Bond Resolutions and working capital funds.

 (5) Any liability or cost, including settlements and judgments, incurred as a result of or related to the ownership, operation or maintenance of the Priest Rapids Project and not covered by insurance.

 (6) Costs incurred by the District in applying for a New FERC License as recorded on the District's books of account for the Priest Rapids Project (account number 183090), including but not limited to those costs and interest expenses incurred before November 1, 2005 ("New FERC License Costs"). New FERC License Costs incurred prior to November 1, 2005 will be recovered uniformly over a 15-year amortization period commencing with the Contract Year starting on January 1, 2006. The estimated New FERC License Costs incurred by the District after November 1, 2005 will be included in Annual Power Costs. In the event of termination of this contract for any reason subsequent to the effective date of the New FERC License, the Purchaser shall pay the District an amount equal to the unrecovered New FERC License Costs multiplied by the Purchaser Power Allocation at the time of termination. In the event of termination of this contract for any reason prior to the effective date of the New FERC License, Purchaser shall have no liability for unrecovered New FERC License Costs.

 (7) Obligations entered into by the District as part of its effort to obtain a New FERC License, including but not limited to the cost of replacing Priest Rapids Project Products that may be committed in such obligations.

 (8) Costs incurred by the District to fulfill obligations, if any, to parties to the 1956 and 1959 Contracts who do not sign this contract, as such costs are required or approved by a court, or reasonably approved by the District after notice to the Purchaser.

 (9) An amount equal to 15% of debt service in that Contract Year or such higher amount as may be required by a Bond Resolution ("Coverage Requirement").

 (b) The District shall credit against Annual Power Costs the following:

 (1) Any insurance or other proceeds received by the District as reimbursement for damages, losses, costs or expenses included in the Annual Power Costs, and any insurance or other proceeds received as a result of the interruption or reduction of Priest Rapids Project Output.

 (2) Revenue, if any, received from obligations entered into by the District as part of its effort to obtain a New FERC License.

 (3) Revenue, if any, received as a result of the District fulfilling obligations to parties to the 1956 or 1959 Contracts that do not sign this contract, pursuant to Section (1)(b) of those contracts, excluding revenue required to be paid pursuant to the 1959 Contract.

 (4) The Coverage Requirement, to the extent that it is not expended during a Contract Year for capital or other costs of the Priest Rapids Project (the amount not spent shall be credited against Annual Power Costs for the following Contract Year).

 (5) Interest earnings on funds of the Priest Rapids Project that are not required to be retained by such fund by a Bond Resolution.

 (6) An estimate of the cost of the Reasonable Portion, which shall be an amount equal to the product of the Reasonable Portion and the Annual Power Costs.

 (c) Costs directly or indirectly associated with the District's Electric System or any other separate system of the District shall not be part of Annual Power Costs other than the payment of Debt held by the Electric System.

 (d) Any payment received by the District as a result of the taking of the whole or any portion of the Priest Rapids Project Output by any state or federal government agency shall be used by the District to credit Annual Power Costs or to retire, at or prior to maturity, Debt, whichever shall be proper under the circumstances existing at the time of the taking.

 (e) The Purchaser agrees that the District shall have the sole discretion to determine what portion, if any, of the Priest Rapid Project financing will be accomplished by issuance of Debt and the terms and covenants of any Debt.

 (1) To the extent that the District makes Improvements to the Priest Rapids Project that are not financed by Debt proceeds, Annual Power Costs will include a cost as determined by the following: the District shall determine all of the Improvements anticipated for the Priest Rapids Project for the Contract Year and the District shall estimate the weighted average economic service life of the Improvements, and shall calculate a weighted average market interest rate assuming the District were to issue Debt to finance such Improvements, both as reasonably determined by the District. Based on such calculations the District shall include in Annual Power Costs an amount sufficient to amortize the costs (including both interest and principal pursuant to this Section 6(e)(1)) of such Improvements on a level basis over a period equal to the estimated weighted average economic service life of the Improvements. The amortization period for any Improvements shall not exceed 30 years and land shall be deemed to have a service life of 30 years. The District may adjust prospectively the amortization of any Improvements to reflect the actual costs of such Improvements, to correct any error in computation or to reflect a material change in the District's estimate of the average economic life of the Improvements. The District shall not be required to amortize capital expenditures that are estimated to cost below the amount that in accordance with the District's capitalization policy are not required to be capitalized and may include such costs in Annual Power Costs.

 (2) To the extent that the District issues Debt (i) with a final maturity that is not earlier than the expiration of the estimated weighted average service life of the Improvements, to be financed with the Debt and (ii) the total annual amounts required for the payment of interest, principal and sinking fund requirements of such Debt when due in a Contract Year do not vary by more than 10% from those required in any other Contract Year, then Annual Power Costs shall include the actual principal and sinking fund requirements that accrues and is payable into the debt service fund for that Debt for the Contract Year. To the extent that the District issues Debt that does not meet the requirements of (i) and (ii) in the prior sentence, then Annual Power Costs will include, with respect to such Debt, an amount as determined by the District as of the date of issuance of the Debt, sufficient to amortize the original principal amount of such Debt on a level debt service basis over a period equal to the estimated weighted average economic service life of the Improvements financed or refinanced by such Debt, commencing on the later of (a) the date of issuance of the Debt or (b) the in service date of such Improvements, and based on an interest rate equal to, at the election of the District, either (i) the weighted average interest rate of the Debt or (ii) the weighted average market rate at the time of issuance of the Debt for debt with similar terms and borrowers similar to the District, as reasonably determined by the District. The amortization period for any Debt shall not exceed 30 years, land shall be deemed to have an economic useful life of 30 years, and any Debt proceeds deposited into a reserve account shall be credited against Annual Power Cost in the final year of the Debt. The District may adjust prospectively the amortization of the principal amount of any Debt to correct any error in computation or to reflect a material change in  the District's reasonable estimate of the in service date or the average economic life of the Improvements.

 (3) To the extent that the District creates or replenishes reserve and contingency funds required by Bond Resolutions or working capital funds that are not financed by Debt proceeds, Annual Power Costs will include a cost determined in a manner analogous to the calculation in Section 6(e)(2) with such amounts amortized over 15 years. Upon termination of this contract, any such funds will belong to the District.

 (f) On or prior to July 31st of each year, for budgetary purposes only and not for determining Priest Rapids Project Products or Purchaser's payment obligations under this contract, the District shall provide the Purchaser a pro forma budget showing an estimate of Annual Power Costs, Priest Rapids Project Output, and Estimated District Loads for the following Contract Year.

 SECTION 7. PAYMENT FOR PRIEST RAPIDS PROJECT PRODUCTS AND RISK PREMIUM.

 (a) On or before 30 days prior to the beginning of each Contract Year beginning in 2005, the District shall prepare and mail the Purchaser a pro forma statement for the next Contract Year showing:

 (1) An estimate of Annual Power Costs specifically assigned to the Purchaser. Specific assignment shall occur whenever a Purchaser or a group of Purchasers cause identifiable costs to be placed on the Priest Rapids Project, including but not limited to increased interest costs of Debt that can not be issued as tax-exempt because of the Purchaser's expected use of any Priest Rapids Project Product or violation of Section 24(b).

 (2) A detailed estimate of the Annual Power Costs, less those costs specifically assigned in Section 7(a)(1), for the Contract Year.

 (3) An estimate of the cost to the Purchaser of the Surplus Product, which shall be an amount obtained by multiplying the estimated Annual Power Costs from Section 7(a)(2) by the Purchaser Power Allocation calculated in Section 5(b)(4).

 (4) An estimate of the cost to the Purchaser of the Displacement Product, which shall be the cost, including the costs of transmission and necessary services, to the District of acquiring Displacement Resources multiplied by the ratio of the Displacement Product available to Purchaser determined pursuant to Section 5(h) and the total Displacement Resource determined pursuant to Section 5(h).

 (5) An estimate of the "Purchaser Risk Premium" to be paid by Purchaser equal to the product of the Risk Premium determined pursuant to Section 5(i) and the applicable percentage determined as follows:

 (A) The applicable percentage is zero if the Purchaser has executed this contract on or before December 31, 2001 or, in the case of the City of Forest Grove, McMinnville, Milton-Freewater or Seattle City Light, has provided to the District written assurances on or before December 31, 2001 that the superintendent or city manager supports this contract and will so recommend to its respective city council and this contract is executed on or before March 31, 2002 in the case of Seattle City Light, and on or before February 1, 2002, in the case of Forest Grove, McMinnville or Milton-Freewater.

 (B) If Purchaser executed this contract after December 31, 2001, but on or before December 31, 2002, the applicable percentage is 25 percent.

 (C) If Purchaser executed this contract after December 31, 2002, but on or before December 31, 2003, the applicable percentage is 50 percent.

 (D) If Purchaser executed this contract after December 31, 2003, but on or before December 31, 2004, the applicable percentage is 75 percent.

 (E) If Purchaser executed this contract after December 31, 2004, but on or before December 31, 2009, the applicable percentage is 100 percent.

 (F) If Purchaser has violated any provision of Section 8, the applicable percentage is 100 percent.

 (6) If the percentage of Risk Premium applicable to Purchaser, pursuant to Section 7(a)(5), is zero, Purchaser shall be entitled to a credit against Purchaser Estimated Cost equal to the sum of:

 (A) The product of the Purchaser Product Percentage of Surplus Product as set forth in Section 3(a) (or as reallocated pursuant to Section 3(c) or (d) among Purchasers with a Risk Premium percentage of zero) and the Risk Premium Revenues from the Surplus Product.

 (B) The product of the Purchaser Product Percentage of the Displacement Product as set forth in Section 3(b) (or as reallocated pursuant to Section 3(c) or (d) among Purchasers with a Risk Premium percentage of zero) and the Risk Premium Revenues from the Displacement Product.

 The District shall retain for its own use any Risk Premium Revenues that are not allocated pursuant to Section 7(a)(6).

 (7) An estimate of the cost to the District of selling capacity and energy using the Displacement Product, as elected by the Purchaser pursuant to Section 3(b)

 (8) The sum of amounts (expressed in dollars) calculated pursuant to Sections 7(a)(1), (3), (4), (5) and (6), hereinafter referred to as the "Purchaser Estimated Cost."

 (9) The amount of the monthly payments to be made by the Purchaser to pay the Purchaser Estimated Cost during the next Contract Year.

 (b) The pro forma statement provided pursuant to Section 7(a) shall be in lieu of the issuance of monthly bills to the Purchaser by the District, and the Purchaser shall be obligated to pay the monthly amounts contained therein in accordance with this Section 7.

 (c) In the event of receipts or payments substantially affecting the Annual Power Costs during any Contract Year, the District shall prepare and mail to the Purchaser a revised statement of estimated Annual Power Costs and Purchaser Estimated Cost, which revised statement shall supersede any previous statement or revised statement, and the Purchaser shall be obligated to make monthly payments set forth on such revised statement for the balance of the Contract Year.

 (d) Purchaser Estimated Cost shall continue to accrue and the Purchaser shall make payment for the same up to the time of termination of this contract for whatever reason, irrespective of the condition of the Priest Rapids Project and whether or not it is capable of producing Priest Rapids Project Products. If the Priest Rapids Project is not capable of producing Priest Rapids Project Products, then the Purchaser Estimated Cost will be based on Priest Rapids Project Output in the last full year of operation. In this event, at the request of the Purchaser, the District will make its reasonable best efforts to acquire replacement Priest Rapids Products the cost of which will be added to the Purchaser Estimated Cost.

 (e) The monthly payments of Purchaser Estimated Costs set forth in the statement or revised statement shall be due and payable by electronic funds transfer to the District's account, designated in writing by the District, on the 20th calendar day of each month.

 (f) If payment in full of any monthly payment amount set forth on a statement or revised statement is not received by the District on or before the close of business on the 20th day of the month, a delayed payment charge of 2% of the unpaid amount due will be made. Any bill which remains unpaid for more than 30 days after the due date shall, in addition to the delayed payment charge, accrue interest at the lesser of 1.5% per month or the maximum rate allowed by law. If the 20th calendar day of the month is a Saturday, Sunday or a District recognized holiday, the next following business day shall be the last day on which payment may be received without the addition of the delayed-payment charge. Additionally, if payment due to the District under this Section 7 remains unpaid 30 days after the due date, the District may thereafter suspend delivery of Priest Rapids Project Products to the Purchaser which would otherwise occur until payment in full of all amounts due and owing (including any interest and delay charges) is received by the District.

 (g) On or before 150 days after the end of each Contract Year, the District will submit to the Purchaser a detailed statement of the Purchaser Estimated Cost and the Purchaser Actual Cost for the Contract Year. "Purchaser Actual Cost" on such statement shall be calculated in the same manner as Purchaser Estimated Cost as set forth in Sections 7(a)(1)-(7) but using the actual costs incurred by the District in the preceding Contract Year; provided, however, that the estimated values calculated pursuant to Sections 5(b)(1)-(2) shall not be modified. If the Purchaser Actual Costs exceed the Purchaser Estimated Costs on such statement ("Excess Costs"), the District shall bill the Purchaser for an amount equal to such Excess Costs, and the Purchaser shall pay such bill within 30 days or be subject to the delayed-payment and interest charges as provided in Section 7(f). If the Purchaser Actual Costs are less than the Purchaser Estimated Costs, or if credits are due pursuant to Section 6(b)(1)-(5) or both ("Refund Costs"), the District shall give credit to the Purchaser against the Purchaser Estimated Costs for the current Contract Year in an amount equal to such Refund Costs; provided, that if Refund Costs are due to Purchaser following the expiration of this contract, the District shall make a cash refund of such amount to the Purchaser.

 (h) The District may use any payments received from the Purchaser under this contract in any manner that the District, in its sole discretion, shall determine. The District agrees to pay or cause to be paid for the Priest Rapids Project from lawfully available money of the District, including payments from the Purchaser and other Purchasers, all the operating costs, taxes and assessments, capital expenditures, payments required for Debt and other costs of the Priest Rapids Project. If the District issues tax-exempt Debt based on the governmental use of the Priest Rapids Project Output by the Purchaser, the Purchaser covenants that it shall not use any Priest Rapids Project Output in a manner, or take any other action, that will or is likely to adversely affect the tax-exempt status of any Debt.

 SECTION 8. SUPPORT AND COOPERATION.

 (a) The District shall make application and use reasonable efforts to obtain a New FERC License and obtain FERC approval of this contract, if required. The District reserves the right to determine when such applications should be made.

 (b) In accordance with FERC direction contained in the PL 83-544 Orders, the District commits to providing the Eligible Purchasers with a meaningful priority in the sale of the Reasonable Portion.

 (c) Purchasers may also participate in the development by the District of a proposed Marketing Plan. This Marketing Plan will be submitted to FERC for approval as part of the relicensing process application; provided, however, that nothing in this Section shall be construed as compelling the Purchaser to comment on or refrain from commenting on the Marketing Plan.

 (d) Purchaser covenants that it shall provide reasonable support, cooperation and assistance to the District in the District's acquisition of a New and Annual FERC License, any necessary federal, state or local permits relating to the Priest Rapids Project, FERC approval of this contract, if FERC approval is requested by the District; provided, however, that nothing in this contract shall preclude the Purchaser from filing comments with FERC to protect the Purchaser's economic benefits provided by this contract.

 (e) In the event that the District believes that the Purchaser has violated any of the above covenants of Section 8(d), the District may by written notice to the Purchaser describe the alleged violation in reasonable detail and give the Purchaser no less than 10 business days within which to cease the activity in question or to provide to the District a written explanation as to why the Purchaser believes the activity does not constitute a violation of any of the aforementioned covenants. If the Purchaser does not cure the alleged default and the District continues to consider the action to be in breach of the covenants, the matter shall be resolved pursuant to arbitration conducted under Section 28. If the Purchaser is determined to be in breach of the covenants, the District shall have the right to terminate this contract effective immediately upon written notice to the Purchaser, without any liability or further obligation on the part of the District. In the event of such termination, the District shall have the right to use or sell, in any manner the District determines, any Priest Rapids Project Product the Purchaser would have been otherwise entitled to under this contract.

 (f) Purchaser covenants that it shall refrain from filing or supporting any FERC license application for the Priest Rapids Project other than that filed by the District and refrain from filing or supporting any effort that would lead to modification of the FERC decisions on Public Law 83-544 contained in the PL 83-544 Orders, unless such a request or petition is filed by the District and the Purchaser agrees with that request or petition. For purposes of this Section 8(f), "refrain from supporting" means prepare no documents, sign no other agreement or contract other than this contract for Priest Rapids Project Output or for other products or that is contingent upon an entity other than the District receiving a license from FERC to operate the Priest Rapids Project, submit no testimony, engage in no lobbying and provide no funding.

 (g) The Purchaser covenants that it will not take any action which, in the opinion of a neutral third party, would likely be construed as: (i) having a material adverse effect on the District's ability to obtain an Annual FERC License or a New FERC License or the anticipated economic benefits of this contract or (ii) constituting a judicial challenge to the authority of the District or the Purchaser to enter into and implement the provisions of this contract. This covenant does not apply to anticipated economic benefits under other agreements between the District and third parties, such as with the Bonneville Power Administration.

 (h) In the event that the District believes that the Purchaser has violated any of the above covenants of Section 8(f) or (g), the District may by written notice to the Purchaser describe the alleged violation in reasonable detail and give the Purchaser no less than 4 business days after receipt of such written notice by Purchaser within which to cease the activity in question or to provide to the District a written explanation as to why the Purchaser believes the activity does not constitute a violation of any of the aforementioned covenants. If the Purchaser does not cure the alleged default and the District continues to reasonably consider the action to be in breach of the covenants, the District shall have the right to terminate this contract and the 1956 and 1959 Contracts, effective immediately upon written notice to the Purchaser, without any liability or further obligation on the part of the District. In the event of such termination, the District shall have the right to use or sell, in any manner the District determines, any Priest Rapids Project Product the Purchaser would have been otherwise entitled to under this contract and any output from the Priest Rapids Project under the 1956 or 1959 Contracts.

 SECTION 9. SCHEDULING OF DELIVERIES OF SURPLUS AND DISPLACEMENT PRODUCTS.

 (a) This Section 9 shall apply only to the scheduling of the Surplus and Displacement Products.

 (b) It is the intent of the Parties that Priest Rapids Project Output shall be fully coordinated with other resources available to the Purchaser and with the resources of other Purchasers and that the operation of the Priest Rapids Project shall be consistent with existing Operating Agreements unless mutually agreed to by the Parties. If provisions of this Section 9 conflict with the provisions of any Operating Agreement to which both the District and the Purchaser are parties, the conflicting provisions of such Operating Agreement shall prevail. Scheduling of Priest Rapids Project Output shall be as requested by the Purchaser, acting singly or as a member of a group of Purchasers, subject to the limitations set forth in this contract.

 (c) The Purchaser, acting singly or as a member of a group of Purchasers, shall make available to the District each normal working day, in conformance with then prevailing scheduling procedures for scheduling Pacific Northwest generating resources, hourly schedules of desired Surplus Product deliveries for the following day or days. The schedules will be completed in a time frame consistent with standard industry practices in the Pacific Northwest. Such schedule shall be based upon the probable water supply to the Priest Rapids Project (inflows) and the resulting probable output. Revisions in the schedule may be made at any time upon the request of the Purchaser if required by changes in estimated river flows or system loads. Deviations from schedules shall be held to a minimum by the District and corrected for as promptly as practicable on an hourly basis under conditions as nearly equivalent as practicable to those occurring when the deviations occurred. Alternatively, the Purchaser may provide scheduling information via a dynamic electronic signal.

 (d) The schedules for Surplus Product requested by the Purchaser shall be in accordance with the following:

 (1) The net hourly schedule for delivery or spill shall be within the limitations of the Purchaser Power Allocation and the Purchaser Power Allocation of the minimum discharge as determined by the District.

 (2) The District shall make all determinations concerning the Priest Rapids Project maximum output and minimum discharge; the District shall have the unilateral right to determine the maximum allowable amount of change in Priest Rapids Project Output during any time period and the maximum number of unit starts and stops allowable during any time period. Such operating guidelines will be reviewed annually with the Purchaser. The District will consider suggestions by the Purchaser, then make its final determination consistent with Prudent Utility Practice. The Purchaser shall schedule Priest Rapids Project Output requests within such guidelines.

 (3) Each Purchaser's schedule shall not be less than the Purchaser Power Allocation of the minimum operating capability of the Priest Rapids Project; provided, however, that if at times one or more Purchasers schedule more than their Purchaser Power Allocation of the minimum operating capability of the Priest Rapids Project, the Purchasers that have scheduled their Purchaser Power Allocation of such minimum operating capability may reduce their schedules during such times subject to meeting the minimum operating requirements of the Priest Rapids Project.

 (4) Subject to Section 5(j), the Purchaser shall be entitled to a share of the Priest Rapids Project Output each hour, determined by multiplying the total Priest Rapids Project inflows by the Purchaser Power Allocation.

 (5) In addition to Priest Rapids Project Output available under Section 9(d)(4), the Purchaser shall be entitled to a share of the pondage available at the Priest Rapids Project (the "Purchaser Allocation of Pondage"), determined by multiplying the total of the pondage available by the Purchaser Power Allocation. The pondage available at the Priest Rapids Project shall be determined by the District as the volume of water that can be stored between the then current maximum forebay elevation and the then current minimum forebay elevation.

 (6) The District will establish and maintain for Purchaser a pondage account that will reflect the use of pondage by the Purchaser. The Purchaser may schedule more or less than its share of the Priest Rapids Project inflows determined in accordance with Section 9(c) by scheduling from or to such pondage account. The aggregate amount of the energy scheduled from the pondage account shall not exceed the Purchaser Allocation of Pondage determined in accordance with Section 9(d)(5) and scheduling by the Purchaser to its pondage account shall be only against its prior accumulated pondage draft.

 (7) During any hour that spill is occurring at the Priest Rapids Project in order to control the forebay elevation, the spill shall first reduce the inflow of each of the Purchasers whose pondage account is overfull proportionate to the amount of the overfill, but not exceeding the amount of the overfill. If unallocated spill remains, it shall next be allocated to reduce the inflow of each of the Purchasers whose request for generation is less than its entitlement during the hour, in proportion to the amount by which its request is less than its entitlement. Any remaining unallocated spill shall be allocated to reduce the inflow of all Purchasers in proportion to each Purchaser Power Allocation.

 (8) During any hour that spill is occurring at the Priest Rapids Project for fish or any other non-power purpose determined necessary or desirable by the District, the spill shall be allocated to reduce the inflow of all Purchasers in proportion to each Purchaser Power Allocation.

 (9) The District has the right to operate the Priest Rapids Project in such manner as it deems to be in its best interests so long as the same is consistent with the FERC License, applicable laws and regulations, Prudent Utility Practice and this contract.

 (a) The District agrees to keep records of the Priest Rapids Project in accordance with the Uniform System of Accounts as prescribed by FERC for electric utilities and licensees; provided, if there are inconsistencies between the Uniform System of Accounts and this contract, this contract shall control. The Purchaser, upon at least 30 days advance written notice to the District, shall have the right to audit or examine operating and financial records relating to the Priest Rapids Project during the District's normal business hours. To the extent practicable, the Purchasers shall conduct any such audit or examination jointly to minimize the disruption to the District's business operations. All costs incurred by the District associated with such audit, including, but not limited to, District labor, materials and reproduction services shall be billed to the Purchaser, and shall be promptly reimbursed by the Purchaser in accordance with Section 7(e).

 (b) Public liability for bodily injury and property damage;

 (c) Physical loss or damage to the Priest Rapids Project on a replacement cost basis; and

 (d) Any other insurance determined to be necessary.

 SECTION 15. ADDITIONAL FACILITIES AND PRODUCTS.

 (a) From time to time during the term of this contract the District may decide in its sole discretion, and in the absence of any requirement by FERC or any state or federal agency, to take actions to increase the Priest Rapids Project Output, including but not limited to installation of additional generating facilities or raising the forebay elevation. Whenever the District proposes to so increase the Priest Rapids Project Output, it shall give notice in writing of such intent to the Purchaser stating:

 (1) The estimated additional Priest Rapids Project Output that is expected to be available as a result of the installation of the proposed changes;

 (2) The estimated incremental cost (i.e. the costs which will be incurred as a result of installing the proposed changes which costs would not be incurred were such proposed additional facilities not installed) of the additional Priest Rapids Project Output on an annual basis;

 (3) The estimated construction period for the installation of the proposed changes; and

 (4) Other available pertinent information.

 (b) Following the issuance of notice of a proposal as provided in Section 15(a), the Purchaser shall have the following options: (i) Purchaser may terminate this contract effective one year after the date of the issuance of a FERC order approving the changes to the Priest Rapids Project; or (ii) Purchaser may elect not to participate in the proposed increase in the Priest Rapids Project Output and to retain this contract, in which case the Parties shall attempt in good faith to negotiate a mutually acceptable agreement setting out, among other matters, any adjustments to Purchaser Product Percentages of Priest Rapids Project Products and Purchaser's responsibility for the Annual Power Costs. Such options shall be exercised by giving written notice to the District of Purchaser's election on or before the expiration of 90 days from the date of receipt of the written notice issued pursuant to Section 15(a). In the event that Purchaser has elected option (ii) above and the Parties fail to negotiate a mutually acceptable agreement, Purchaser may elect to terminate this contract pursuant to option (i) so long as the written notice of termination is received by the District on or before the expiration of 180 days from the date of receipt of the written notice issued pursuant to Section 15(a). If the Purchaser does not exercise either of its options pursuant to this Section 15(b) or if the Parties fail to negotiate a mutually acceptable agreement and the Purchaser does not timely provide the District with a notice of termination, then the Purchaser shall be obligated to pay its proportionate share of the costs and expenses related to the additional generating capability as provided in Sections 6 and 7, and shall be entitled to receive a percentage of such additional Priest Rapids Project Output determined on the basis of the Purchaser Power Allocation.

 (c) If at any time the District determines that it is not desirable for it to proceed with the changes as proposed pursuant to Section 15(a), the District shall be under no obligation to proceed with such changes and shall so notify the Purchaser in writing of such determination not to proceed. If the Purchaser has exercised its option to terminate this contract pursuant to Section 15(b), such termination shall be cancelled upon the issuance of the written notification by the District pursuant to this Section 15(c), but only if such written notification by the District is issued within one year of the date of the issuance of a FERC order approving the changes.

 (d) All costs of studies, engineering, and administrative activities necessary to apply for and receive FERC approval of the proposed changes to the Priest Rapids Project shall be included as Annual Power Costs and the Purchaser shall pay its share of such costs pursuant to Section 7; provided, however, if the Purchaser has given notice of termination of this contract in accordance with Section 15(b) and such termination has not been cancelled pursuant to Section 15(c), then the Purchaser shall not be liable for any such costs.

 (e) Notwithstanding any other provisions of this Section 15, whenever the District determines that it is necessary or in its best interest to modify the Priest Rapids Project in any way or to install additional facilities at or in the Priest Rapids Project to comply with any law, rule, regulation, or order of FERC or any state or federal agency with authority to issue or make and enforce such an order, rule, regulation or decision, the Purchaser shall share the benefits and costs resulting from the modification or installation of the additional facilities in the same manner and to the same extent as provided above, except that the Purchaser shall not have the option to terminate or adjust its interest and participation in this contract as provided in Section 15(b).

 (f) At any time a Purchaser may request the District to modify the Priest Rapids Project or propose conservation projects within Grant County. The District commits to consider such requests in good faith; however, the District is under no obligation to agree to implement such requests.

 SECTION 16. PROJECT INTEGRATION.

 (a) It is the intention of the Parties hereto that the operation of the Priest Rapids Project shall be integrated and that all benefits accruing as a result of such integration shall be shared equally by the Priest Rapids and Wanapum Developments. It is also agreed that before November 1, 2009 and after such date if required by any Bond Resolution, all joint costs of the Priest Rapids and Wanapum Developments shall be equitably allocated between them as determined by the District.

 (b) The Parties agree that any compensation (whether energy or money) due or which may become due the owner of the Rock Island Hydroelectric Project because of encroachment by the Priest Rapids Project after November 1, 2009 on the Rock Island Hydroelectric Project will either proportionately reduce the amount of Priest Rapids Project Output or be included in Annual Power Costs, as appropriate, but shall not reduce the amount required to be paid by the Purchaser under Sections 6 and 7. "Rock Island Hydroelectric Project" shall mean the FERC Hydroelectric Project No. 943 currently operated by Public Utility District No. 1 of Chelan County, Washington.

 SECTION 17. LIABILITY OF PARTIES.

 (a) Except as otherwise provided in this contract, each Party hereby releases the other Party and its commissioners, officers, directors, agents and employees from any claim for loss or damage arising out of the ownership, operation, and maintenance of the Priest Rapids Project including any loss of profits or revenues, loss of use of power system, cost of capital, cost of purchased or replacement power, other substantially similar liability or other direct or indirect consequential loss or damage, except as provided in the Agreement Limiting Liability Among Western Interconnected Systems for parties to that agreement.

 SECTION 21. ASSIGNMENT OF CONTRACT.

 Neither the Purchaser nor the District shall by contract, operation of law or otherwise, assign this contract or any right or interest in this contract without the prior written consent of the other Party, which shall not be unreasonably withheld; provided, however, a Party may, without the consent of the other Party (and without relieving itself from liability hereunder): (i) transfer or assign this contract to an affiliate of the Party provided that the affiliate's creditworthiness is equal or higher than that of the Party; or (ii) transfer or assign this contract to any person or entity succeeding to all or substantially all of the distribution and generating facilities of the Party whose creditworthiness is equal or higher than that of the Party; provided, however, that in each such case, any such assignee shall agree in writing to be bound by the terms and conditions in this contract and the transferring Party shall deliver such tax and enforceability assurance as the other Party may reasonably request.

 SECTION 22. REMEDIES ON DEFAULT.

 (a) "Act of Default" shall mean:

 (1) The failure of a Party to make, when due, any payment required under this contract if such failure is not remedied within three days after written notice, provided that the payment is not the subject of a good faith dispute pursuant to Section 28. If requested by the District, the Purchaser shall deposit the disputed amount in escrow with a bank acceptable to the Parties.

 (2) Any representation or warranty in this contract is false or misleading in any material respect when made or ceases to remain true during the term of this contract.

 (3) The failure of the Purchaser, after Section 8 or any provision thereof has been found by a court to be void, unlawful or unenforceable, to perform in accordance with the provisions of Section 8, including without limitation any provision or provisions found to be void, unlawful or unenforceable.

 (4) A Party shall make an assignment or any general arrangement for the benefit of creditors; file a petition or otherwise commence or acquiesce in the commencement of a proceeding under any bankruptcy or similar law for the protection of creditors; or otherwise becomes bankrupt or insolvent or unable to pay its debts as they fall due.

 (b) If a Party commits an Act of Default during the term of this contract, the non-defaulting Party may take any one or more of the following remedial steps:

 (1) Take any action or exercise any remedy provided to the Party under the provisions of Sections 7 or 8.

 (2) Except where a different time period is set forth herein, if the defaulting Party fails to remedy an Act of Default within ten days after receiving written notification of the default, then the non- defaulting Party may give a written notice of termination of this contract on a date specified in such notice, which date shall be not less than 30 days after the date of such notice. If the Purchaser is given written notice as provided herein, this contract shall terminate upon the date specified in such notice, the Purchaser thereafter shall have no right, title, or interest in, to, or with respect to the Priest Rapids Project, or any Priest Rapids Project Product, or any Priest Rapids Project Output, but the Purchaser shall remain liable for all amounts due the District which have accrued prior to the date of termination.

 (3) The District may, prior to the termination of this contract pursuant to Section 22(b)(2), at any time suspend any and all rights of the Purchaser to the Priest Rapids Project Products upon not less than five days' notice to the Purchaser. The District may, without further notice to the Purchaser, grant any or all of such suspended rights to any person or entity for the duration of the suspension. In such event, the Purchaser shall, in addition to its other obligations under this contract, upon demand, pay to the District all expenses and any losses incurred in connection with such suspension and any grant of the suspended rights to another person or entity. No suspension of any or all of the rights of the Purchaser to Priest Rapids Project Products shall be construed as an election to terminate the interests of the Purchaser in, to, and under this contract unless a written notice of termination is given to the Purchaser pursuant to this contract or unless such termination be decreed by a court of competent jurisdiction.

 (4) The non-defaulting Party may begin and maintain successive proceedings against the defaulting Party for the recovery of damages or for a sum equal to any and all payments required to be made pursuant to this contract.

 (5) A Party may take whatever action at law or in equity as may appear necessary or desirable to collect the amounts payable by the defaulting Party under this contract then due and thereafter to become due, or to enforce performance and observation of any obligation, agreement or covenant of the defaulting Party under this contract.

 (6) No right or remedy conferred upon or reserved to a Party is intended to be exclusive of any other right or remedy, and each and every right and remedy shall be cumulative and in addition to any other right or remedy given hereunder, or now or hereafter legally existing, upon the occurrence of any Act of Default. Failure of the District to insist at any time on the strict observance or performance by the Purchaser of any of the provisions of this contract, or to exercise any right or remedy provided for in this contract shall not impair any such right or remedy nor be construed as a waiver or relinquishment thereof for the future. Receipt by the District of any payment required to be made hereunder with knowledge of the breach of any provisions of this contract shall not be deemed a waiver of such breach. In addition to all other remedies provided in this contract, the District shall be entitled, to the extent permitted by applicable law, to injunctive relief in case of the violation, or attempted or threatened violation, of any of the provisions of this contract, or to a decree requiring performance of any of the provisions of this contract or to any other remedy legally allowed to the District.

The Purchaser shall cooperate and take whatever action is necessary to cooperate fully with the District in meeting such requirements. Obligations of the District contained in this contract are hereby expressly made subordinate and subject to such compliance.

 (b) The Purchaser shall ensure that Priest Rapids Project Products available to Purchaser under this contract are not sold, resold, distributed for use or used outside the Pacific Northwest in violation of the Bonneville Project Act, Public Law 75-329, the Pacific Northwest Consumer Power Preference Act, Public Law 88-552, the Regional Act or in contravention of any applicable state or federal law, order, regulation, or policy. If such sales occur in violation of the foregoing, the Purchaser shall reimburse the District for any penalties imposed on and costs incurred by the District as a consequence of such violation.

 SECTION 25. HEADINGS.

 The headings of sections and paragraphs of this contract are for convenience of reference only and are not intended to restrict, affect or be of any weight in the interpretation or construction of the provisions of such sections and paragraphs.

 SECTION 26. ENTIRE AGREEMENT; MODIFICATION; CONFLICT IN PRECEDENCE.

 This contract does not modify the terms and conditions contained in the 1956 and 1959 Contracts except as provided in Sections 1(b) and 8. This contract constitutes the entire agreement between the Parties with respect to the subject matter of this contract, and supersedes all previous communications between the Parties, either verbal or written, with respect to such subject matter. No modifications of this contract shall be binding upon the Parties unless such modifications are in writing signed by each Party. To the extent there are any conflicting provisions between this contract and the 1956 Contract, or this contract and the 1959 Contract after November 1, 2009, the terms and conditions in this contract shall take precedence and be controlling and the 1956 and 1959 Contracts are hereby amended accordingly.

 SECTION 27. NO PARTNERSHIP OR THIRD PARTY RIGHTS.

 (a) This contract shall not be interpreted or construed to create an association, joint venture or partnership between the Parties, or to impose any partnership obligations or liability upon any Party. Without limiting the foregoing, Purchaser shall not be liable for, and the District hereby releases the Purchaser from, the payment of Debt except as provided in Sections 6 and 7.

 (b) This contract shall not be construed to create rights in or grant remedies to any third party as a beneficiary of this contract.

 SECTION 28. PURCHASERS' COMMITTEE; ARBITRATION.

 (a) There is hereby established a Purchasers' committee (the "Committee"). Each Purchaser may appoint one representative (and one alternate) as a Committee member to attend Committee meetings. The members of the Committee shall elect a chair, and may adopt such rules for the conduct of business as it deems appropriate. Meetings between the District and Purchasers shall be held routinely, but not more frequently than once a quarter, provided, however, that such meetings may be held more frequently than once each quarter at the request of the District or upon the request of members of the Committee whose Purchaser Product Percentage of Surplus Product totals 66% or more. All meetings between the District and Purchaser will be held in Grant County, Washington, unless the District and the Purchasers agree to another location.

 (b) In addition to other matters subject to arbitration pursuant to other provisions of this contract, if approved by members of the Committee whose Purchaser Product Percentage of Surplus Product totals 66% or more, the Committee may submit to binding arbitration the following issues:

 (1) Have the Estimated District Loads been forecast in accordance with Prudent Utility Practice and, if not, what is the appropriate Estimated District Loads in accordance with Prudent Utility Practice for the Contract Year?

 (2) Have the Annual Power Costs been determined by the District in accordance with Prudent Utility Practice and have such costs been incurred for the benefit of Priest Rapids Project Output and, if not, what are the appropriate Annual Power Costs in accordance with Prudent Utility Practice for the Contract Year; provided that nothing in this Section shall be interpreted to limit the ability of the District to meet its payment obligations under a Bond Resolution?

 (3) Are discretionary outages that would reduce Priest Rapids Project Output by more than 25% scheduled so as to be fair to both the District and Purchasers given that the benefit of the Priest Rapids Project to the Purchasers declines over time and, if not, what should be the appropriate schedule for outages? Current or future market conditions for electricity will not be a factor in arbitrating this issue. If failure to perform the proposed outage would reasonably reduce Priest Rapids Project Output or conflict with Section 18, the outage will not be subject to arbitration.

 (4) What modifications to this contract, pursuant to Section 3(f), are necessary to comply with FERC or court orders and to preserve the basic benefits and obligations of the Parties?

 (5) Has the Purchaser violated the covenants in Section 8(e)?

 (c) The board of arbitrators shall be composed of three persons, one of whom shall be appointed by the District, one of whom shall be appointed by majority vote of the Committee, and the third person to be appointed by the two persons so appointed. The District and the Committee shall appoint their arbitrator within 15 days after notification of the Committee's vote to submit a matter to binding arbitration. In the event the two members cannot agree upon the appointment of a third person within 10 days, then such third person shall be appointed by the presiding judge of the Superior Court of Kittitas County, Washington. The arbitration shall be conducted jointly by the participating Purchasers, and under rules as may be determined by the arbitrators; provided, however, that all parties shall be afforded discovery consistent with the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure; and, provided further, if the arbitrators do not unanimously agree on the rules governing the arbitration, the arbitration shall be conducted in accordance with the Commercial Arbitration Rules of the American Arbitration Association. The board so designated shall conduct a hearing within 30 days of completion of their selection, and within 15 days after the hearing (unless such time is extended by agreement of the Parties) shall notify the Parties of their decision in writing, stating the reasons therefore and separately listing their findings of fact, conclusions of law and order. Insofar as the Parties hereto may legally do so, they agree to abide by the decision of the board. All factual determinations made by the board shall be conclusive and binding on the Parties and not subject to judicial review. Any conclusions of law made by the board shall be subject to review by a court specified in Section 23; provided, that the order issued by the board shall be effective unless and until a stay is issued by the board or such court suspends the effectiveness of the order.

 SECTION 29. REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES.

 Each Party represents and warrants to the other Party that:

 (a) It is duly organized, validly existing and in good standing under the laws of the jurisdiction of its formation.

 (b) The execution, delivery and performance of this contract are within its powers, have been duly authorized by all necessary action and do not violate any of the terms and conditions in its governing documents, any contracts to which it is a party or any law, rule, regulation, or order applicable to it.

 (c) This contract constitutes a legally valid and binding obligation enforceable against it in accordance with its terms, subject to equitable defenses and applicable bankruptcy, insolvency and similar laws affecting creditors' rights generally.

 The District hereby represents and warrants to the Purchaser that during the term of this contract, the District will not waive, reduce or otherwise forego the collection of the Risk Premium pursuant to Section 7 of this and all other Contracts.

 SECTION 30. COUNTERPARTS.

 This contract may be executed in counterparts, each of which shall be an original and all of which shall constitute the same contract.

 SECTION 3. PROCEEDS FROM THE SALE OF THE REASONABLE PORTION. (a) Pursuant to the PL 83-544 Orders, the Reasonable Portion must be offered for sale. The District, therefore, desires to mitigate the risk associated with generating the Reasonable Portion including, but not limited to, the uncertainty of future Priest Rapids Project Output, costs and market prices. The District believes that this can be best accomplished by allocating to Purchasers the costs and proceeds from the sale of the Reasonable Portion.

 (b) Upon execution of this contract, Purchaser shall select a percentage allocation of the costs and proceeds from the sale of the Reasonable Portion as described below. The percentage allocation of the costs and proceeds from the sale of the Reasonable Portion ("Purchaser Revenue Allocation") shall be 6.14 percent. The amount of the proceeds and the costs from the sale of the Reasonable Portion are defined in Sections 4 and 6, respectively.

 (c) REALLOCATION. If collectively Purchasers subscribe to Purchaser Revenue Allocations that total more than 100%, then Purchaser Revenue Allocations will be determined as follows; provided, however, that the application of the following formula shall not result in the Purchasers being assigned a Purchaser Revenue Allocation larger than that included in this contract on the date of execution:

 (1) Step 1. One-hundred percent of the Purchaser Revenue Allocation will be divided between the Purchasers who are parties to the 1956 and 1959 Contracts, as a group, and the Purchasers who are included in the Idaho Cooperatives, as a group, in proportion to the number of retail electric customers located in the Pacific Northwest (determined by the number of retail meters) served by each group as of October 31, 2000.

 (2) Step 2. Each Purchaser's Revenue Allocation will be determined as follows:

 (A) For Purchasers who are parties to the 1956 and 1959 Contracts, the proportion of such Purchaser Revenue Allocations from Step 1 above will be distributed to individual Purchasers as follows:

 (i) For November 1, 2005 through October 31, 2009 the Purchaser Revenue Allocations shall be distributed in proportion to participation in the 1956 Contract and 1959 Contract weighted 75% and 25%, respectively. (ii) For the period after November 1, 2009 the Purchaser Revenue Allocations shall be distributed in proportion to the sum of participation in the 1956 Contract and 1959 Contract divided by two.

 (B) (B) For the Purchasers who are included in the Idaho Cooperatives, the proportion of such Purchaser Revenue Allocations from Step 1 will be distributed to such individual cooperatives in proportion to the number of retail electric customers located in the Pacific Northwest (determined by number of retail meters) each cooperative served as of October 31, 2000. (B) (d) If the reallocation procedure of Section 3(c) is implemented, then for the period November 1, 2005 through October 31, 2009, the following shall apply to Purchasers who were parties to the 1956 Contracts but were not parties to the 1959 Contracts:

 (1) The Purchaser Revenue Allocation shall be adjusted to be in proportion to participation in the 1956 Contract (the Purchaser's percent participation in the 1956 Contract divided by 63.5%). (2) The District shall be obligated to provide the Reasonable Portion Proceeds pursuant to Section 5 using the Purchaser Revenue Allocation, calculated pursuant to Section 3(d)(1), and the Purchaser shall be obligated to make payments pursuant to Sections 5 and 6 using such Purchaser Revenue Allocation.

 The adjustments to Purchaser Revenue Allocation pursuant to this Section 3(d) will have no effect on the Purchaser Revenue Allocation of any other Purchaser.

 (e) If a Contract with one of the Purchasers is terminated pursuant to Section 17 as a result of such Purchaser's Act of Default, the District shall give the non-defaulting Purchasers notice of such default. Beginning with the first month that is at least 30 days following such notice, the Revenue Allocations (other than zero) of non-defaulting Purchasers shall be increased pro-rata until either: (i) the Purchaser Revenue Allocation of the defaulting Purchaser have been fully allocated or (ii) a further pro rata increase to the Purchaser Revenue Allocations of the non-defaulting Purchasers would adversely affect the tax-exempt status of any outstanding Debt. In the event of (ii), the portion of the Purchaser Revenue Allocation of the defaulting Purchaser not yet allocated will be offered to all Purchasers that can accept such allocation without adversely affecting the tax-exempt status of any outstanding Debt. If after such offer there remains some portion of the Purchaser Revenue Allocation of the defaulting Purchaser not yet allocated, the District at its discretion may elect to accept such unallocated portion. If after all of the foregoing there remains unallocated Purchaser Revenue Allocation of the defaulting Purchaser, the Purchaser Revenue Allocations (other than zero) of non-defaulting Purchasers shall be increased pro rata based on each such non-defaulting Purchaser's Purchaser Revenue Allocation before any allocation under this Section 3(e). In the event that the allocation described in the immediately preceding sentence adversely affects the tax-exempt status of Debt, any increased costs resulting therefrom will be included in Annual Power Costs. Nothing in this subsection is intended to limit any claims the non-defaulting Purchasers may assert against the defaulting Purchaser.

 (f) REGULATORY APPROVALS. The District and the Purchaser believe that this contract fully complies with the requirements of Public Law 83-544. FERC has ordered that a Reasonable Portion of the Priest Rapids Project Output be offered for sale based on market principles and that Eligible Purchasers are to receive a meaningful priority. Additionally, FERC has stated that the District may negotiate power contracts as part of the license application process provided that implementation of such contracts is contingent on receipt of license authority. The District and the Purchaser agree that nothing in this contract limits in any way the District's ability to conform to these FERC requirements. Nothing in this contract, other than Section 7, limits the ability of the Purchaser from participating in any FERC or court proceedings that may address Public Law 83-544.

 The Parties understand that FERC's orders of February 11, 1998 and June 12, 1998 in Docket No. EL95-35 (the "PL 83-544 Orders") require the District, as part of its application for a New FERC License, to file the Marketing Plan for making available the Reasonable Portion in a fair, equitable and non-discriminatory manner pursuant to market-based principles and procedures. The Parties further understand and agree that nothing in this contract is intended to affect or limit in anyway the right of the District to develop and file the Marketing Plan which it determines is consistent with the PL 83-544 Orders.

 In the event that FERC or a court of competent jurisdiction shall by order determine that any provision of this contract violates a requirement of either PL 83-544 or of any of the PL 83-544 Orders, the Parties shall, within 30 days of the entry of such an order, commence negotiations for the purpose of reaching agreement on such amendments to this contract, if any, as may be needed for the purpose of complying with that order and for the purpose of preserving the basic benefits and obligations of the Parties. If, within 90 days of commencement of negotiations, the Parties are not able to resolve their differences and to agree upon any necessary amendments, either Party may, after notice to the other Party, cause the matter to be submitted to binding arbitration as provided in Section 23.

 If following the issuance of the arbitration decision, a Party reasonably determines that acceptance of such amendments will result in materially decreased benefits or materially increased obligations when compared to this contract, the Party may by notice to the other Party explain its reasons for the determination and, if given within 10 days of the arbitration decision, terminate this contract.

 SECTION 4. DETERMINATION OF ESTIMATED PURCHASER REVENUE ALLOCATION OF PROCEEDS FROM THE SALE OF THE REASONABLE PORTION. (a) The estimated Purchaser Revenue Allocation of the Reasonable Portion Proceeds expected to be available to Purchaser during each Contract Year will be determined by application of the following provisions of this Section 4.

 (b) For the purpose of determining the estimated Purchaser Revenue Allocation of the Reasonable Portion Proceeds for the next Contract Year, on or before 30 days prior to the beginning of each Contract Year, the District shall prepare and mail to the Purchaser a pro forma statement showing for the next Contract Year:

 (1) "Estimated District Loads," which shall mean all projected retail electric energy loads for the next Contract Year based on average weather conditions, plus aggregated losses, projected to be used at locations served by the District during the next Contract Year with the exception of (i) locations outside of the geographic boundaries shown on Exhibit B and (ii) that portion of loads of individual retail customers that during a consecutive 12 month period after 2000 exceed by ten average megawatts or more the energy load of such customer for the immediately preceding consecutive 12 month period. Once load at a location is included in Estimated District Loads, loads at such location shall continue to be included in full in future Contract Years without regard to the source of supply for such load. For example, if a load is expected to be served in all or part by an entity other than the District during the next Contract Year, the entire load shall continue to be included in Estimated District Loads. If a new load or increased load of one average megawatt or more at a single retail customer has been included in Estimated District Loads in the current Contract Year, and less than 90% of such new or increased load was actually measured in the current year, then Estimated District Loads shall be reduced for the next Contract Year by the difference between the amount included in the current Contract Year and the amount measured. If there are more than one such new or increased loads for the current Contract Year, they shall be combined for determining both the 90% and the amount of any reduction. If in the current Contract Year a load of one average megawatt or more is placed on the District which was not included in the current Contract Year's Estimated District Loads, then the next Contract Year's Estimated District Loads shall be increased by the amount of such load measured in the current Contract Year. Except for such load correction calculations, Estimated District Loads for the next Contract Year shall be not less than the current Contract Year's Estimated District Loads.

 (2) The estimated amount of firm energy from the Priest Rapids Project for the next Contract Year based on critical water planning using the procedures of Operating Agreements in effect on October 31, 2000, unless the District and Purchasers whose Purchaser Revenue Allocation total 66% or more mutually agree to use procedures from a subsequent Operating Agreement.

 (3) The monthly amount of "Estimated Unmet District Load" determined as follows:

 (A) Prior to November 1, 2009, the Estimated District Load as calculated in Section 4(b)(1) less 70% of the estimated firm energy output of the Priest Rapids Development less 36.5% of the estimated firm energy output of the Wanapum Development both as calculated in Section 4(b)(2).

 (B) On or after November 1, 2009, the Estimated District Loads as calculated in Section 4(b)(1) less 70% of the estimated firm energy output of the Priest Rapids Project as calculated in Section 4(b)(2).

 (C) In the event that the calculation in Section 4(b)(3)(A) or (B) above is less than zero the Estimated Unmet District Load will be zero.

 (D) The difference so determined will be shaped on a monthly basis using the District's historic load patterns.

 (4) The "Estimated District Power Costs" which shall equal the estimated cost, including the costs of transmission and other necessary services, of acquiring the monthly amount of capacity and energy identified in Section 4(b)(3) determined by references to published futures price data and firm power supply contracts entered into by the District, and rates for transmission and other necessary services. Prior to the start of the next Contract Year, any Purchaser may provide the District with a written firm and irrevocable bid(s) for all or part of the capacity and energy needed to serve the Estimated Unmet District Load from Section 4(b)(3) for the next Contract Year, and for which the District has not procured a firm power supply. If such bid(s), or in the case of a partial supply bid the combination of the bid and the Estimated Power Cost for the remaining Estimated Unmet District Load, is less costly than the Estimated District Power Cost set forth in the pro forma statement as determined by the District, the District may either: (i) acquire from the Purchaser the capacity and energy offered, and use the bid price in the calculation of the Estimated District Power Costs for the Estimated Unmet District load so served; or (ii) substitute the bid price for the portion of the Estimated Unmet District Load that could have been served with the capacity and energy so bid in the calculation of Estimated District Power Costs.

 (5) The estimated Reasonable Portion Proceeds.

 (c) Subject to Section 8, in those Contract Years when the District has Estimated District Power Costs as determined pursuant to Section 4(b)(4), the District shall be entitled to and shall take from the actual Reasonable Portion Proceeds the Estimated District Power Costs calculated pursuant to Section 4(b)(4).

 (d) Subject to Section 8, the Purchaser shall have available the actual Reasonable Portion Proceeds received by the District, minus the Estimated District Power Costs as calculated in Section 4(b)(4), multiplied by the Purchaser Revenue Allocation.

 (e) Payment of the Purchaser Revenue Allocation of the Reasonable Portion Proceeds may be reduced if the District does not obtain an Annual FERC License or New FERC License, and under any of the following conditions as determined by the District:

 (1) Pursuant to Section 4.

 (2) If the District is unable to produce the Reasonable Portion due to Uncontrollable Forces.

 (3) If failure to reduce deliveries of the Reasonable Portion would result in exceeding the capability of the Priest Rapids Project or subject it or its operation to undue hazard or violate the FERC License, any applicable law, regulation, or Operating Agreement.

 (4) In case of emergencies or in order to install equipment in, make repairs to, make betterments, renewals, replacements, and additions to ("Improvements"), investigations and inspections of, or perform other maintenance work on the Priest Rapids Project.

 The District will use its reasonable efforts to give advance notice to the Purchaser regarding any planned interruption or reduction, giving the reason therefor and stating the probable duration thereof.

 (f) Notwithstanding any other Section of this contract, if the Priest Rapids Project is capable of producing Priest Rapids Project Output, but the Purchaser Revenue Allocation of the Reasonable Portion Proceeds to be made available to the Purchaser is projected to be zero for a Contract Year, the Purchaser may give the District written notice, no later than 100 days after the start of the Contract Year, that the Purchaser elects to terminate this contract. In such event, this contract shall terminate effective upon receipt of such written notice by the District.

 SECTION 5. ANNUAL POWER COSTS. (a) "Annual Power Costs" as used in this contract shall include, for the Priest Rapids Development beginning November 1, 2005 and for the Priest Rapids Project beginning November 1, 2009, all of the District's costs and expenses of every type, both direct and indirect, resulting from the ownership, operation, maintenance of and Improvements that are incurred or paid by the District during each Contract Year and that are incurred consistent with Prudent Utility Practice.

New FERC License Costs incurred prior to November 1, 2005 will be recovered uniformly over a 15-year amortization period commencing with the Contract Year starting on January 1, 2006. The estimated New FERC License Costs incurred by the District after November 1, 2005 will be included in Annual Power Costs. In the event of termination of this contract for any reason subsequent to the effective date of the New FERC License, the Purchaser shall pay the District an amount equal to the unrecovered New FERC License Costs multiplied by the Purchaser Power Allocation at the time of termination. In the event of termination of this contract for any reason prior to the effective date of the New FERC License, Purchaser shall have no liability for unrecovered New FERC License Costs.

 (7) Obligations entered into by the District as part of its effort to obtain a New FERC License, including but not limited to the cost of replacing Priest Rapids Project Products that may be committed in such obligations.

 (c) Costs directly or indirectly associated with the District's Electric System or any other separate system of the District shall not be part of Annual Power Costs other than the payment of Debt held by the Electric System.

 (d) Any payment received by the District as a result of the taking of the whole or any portion of the Priest Rapids Project Output by any state or federal government agency shall be used by the District to credit Annual Power Costs or to retire, at or prior to maturity, Debt, whichever shall be proper under the circumstances existing at the time of the taking.

 (e) The Purchaser agrees that the District shall have the sole discretion to determine what portion, if any, of the Priest Rapid Project financing will be accomplished by issuance of Debt and the terms and covenants of any Debt.

 (1) To the extent that the District makes Improvements to the Priest Rapids Project that are not financed by Debt proceeds, Annual Power Costs will include a cost as determined by the following: the District shall determine all of the Improvements anticipated for the Priest Rapids Project for the Contract Year and the District shall estimate the weighted average economic service life of the Improvements, and shall calculate a weighted average market interest rate assuming the District were to issue Debt to finance such Improvements, both as reasonably determined by the District. Based on such calculations the District shall include in Annual Power Costs an amount sufficient to amortize the costs (including both interest and principal pursuant to this Section 5(e)(1)) of such Improvements on a level basis over a period equal to the estimated weighted average economic service life of the Improvements. The amortization period for any Improvements shall not exceed 30 years and land shall be deemed to have a service life of 30 years. The District may adjust prospectively the amortization of any Improvements to reflect the actual costs of such Improvements, to correct any error in computation or to reflect a material change in the District's estimate of the average economic life of the Improvements. The District shall not be required to amortize capital expenditures that are estimated to cost below the amount that in accordance with the District's capitalization policy are not required to be capitalized and may include such costs in Annual Power Costs.

 (2) To the extent that the District issues Debt (i) with a final maturity that is not earlier than the expiration of the estimated weighted average service life of the Improvements, to be financed with the Debt and (ii) the total annual amounts required for the payment of interest, principal and sinking fund requirements of such Debt when due in a Contract Year do not vary by more than 10% from those required in any other Contract Year, then Annual Power Costs shall include the actual principal and sinking fund requirements that accrues and is payable into the debt service fund for that Debt for the Contract Year. To the extent that the District issues Debt that does not meet the requirements of (i) and (ii) in the prior sentence, then Annual Power Costs will include, with respect to such Debt, an amount as determined by the District as of the date of issuance of the Debt, sufficient to amortize the original principal amount of such Debt on a level debt service basis over a period equal to the estimated weighted average economic service life of the Improvements financed or refinanced by such Debt, commencing on the later of (a) the date of issuance of the Debt or (b) the in service date of such Improvements, and based on an interest rate equal to, at the election of the District, either (i) the weighted average interest rate of the Debt or (ii) the weighted average market rate at the time of issuance of the Debt for debt with similar terms and borrowers similar to the District, as reasonably determined by the District. The amortization period for any Debt shall not exceed 30 years, land shall be deemed to have an economic useful life of 30 years, and any Debt proceeds deposited into a reserve account shall be credited against Annual Power Cost in the final year of the Debt. The District may adjust prospectively the amortization of the principal amount of any Debt to correct any error in computation or to reflect a material change in the District's reasonable estimate of the in service date or the average economic life of the Improvements.

 (3) To the extent that the District creates or replenishes reserve and contingency funds required by Bond Resolutions or working capital funds that are not financed by Debt proceeds, Annual Power Costs will include a cost determined in a manner analogous to the calculation in Section 5(e)(2) with such amounts amortized over 15 years. Upon termination of this contract, any such funds will belong to the District.

 (f) On or prior to July 31st of each year, for budgetary purposes only and not for determining Priest Rapids Project Products or Purchaser's payment obligations under this contract, the District shall provide the Purchaser a pro forma budget showing an estimate of Annual Power Costs, Priest Rapids Project Output, Purchaser Revenue Allocation and Estimated District Loads for the following Contract Year.

 SECTION 6. PAYMENT FOR PRIEST RAPIDS PROJECT PURCHASER REVENUE ALLOCATION. (a) On or before 30 days prior to the beginning of each Contract Year beginning in 2005, the District shall prepare and mail the Purchaser a pro forma statement for the next Contract Year showing:

 (1) An estimate of Annual Power Costs specifically assigned to the Purchaser. Specific assignment shall occur whenever a Purchaser or a group of Purchasers cause identifiable costs to be placed on the Priest Rapids Project.

 (2) A detailed estimate of the Annual Power Costs, less those costs specifically assigned in Section 6(a)(1), for the Contract Year.

 (3) An estimate of the cost to the Purchaser attributable to the Purchaser Revenue Allocation of the costs of the Reasonable Portion, which shall be an amount equal to the product of the Reasonable Portion and the Annual Power Costs from Section 6(a)(2) multiplied by the ratio of the estimated Reasonable Portion Proceeds to be received by the Purchaser calculated pursuant to Section 4(d) to the estimated total Reasonable Portion Proceeds from Section 4(b)(5).

 (4) The sum of amounts (expressed in dollars) calculated pursuant to Sections 6(a)(1) and (3), hereinafter referred to as the "Purchaser Estimated Cost."

 (5) The amount of the monthly payments to be made by the Purchaser to pay the Purchaser Estimated Cost during the next Contract Year.

 (b) The pro forma statement provided pursuant to Section 6(a) shall be in lieu of the issuance of monthly bills to the Purchaser by the District, and the Purchaser shall be obligated to pay the monthly amounts contained therein in accordance with this Section 6.

 (c) In the event of receipts or payments substantially affecting the Annual Power Costs during any Contract Year, the District shall prepare and mail to the Purchaser a revised statement of estimated Annual Power Costs and Purchaser Estimated Cost, which revised statement shall supersede any previous statement or revised statement, and the Purchaser shall be obligated to make monthly payments set forth on such revised statement for the balance of the Contract Year.

 (d) Purchaser Estimated Cost shall continue to accrue and the Purchaser shall make payment for the same up to the time of termination of this contract for whatever reason, irrespective of the condition of the Priest Rapids Project and whether or not it is capable of producing Priest Rapids Project Output, the Reasonable Portion or the Purchaser Revenue Allocation of the Reasonable Portion Proceeds. If the Priest Rapids Project is not capable of producing Priest Rapids Project Output then the Purchaser Estimated Cost will be based on Priest Rapids Project Output in the last full year of operation. In this event, at the request of the Purchaser, the District will makes its reasonable best efforts to acquire replacement Priest Rapids Products the cost of which will be added to the Purchaser Estimated Cost.

 (e) The monthly payments of Purchaser Estimated Costs set forth in the statement or revised statement shall be due and payable by electronic funds transfer to the District's account, designated in writing by the District, on the 20th calendar day of each month.

 (f) If payment in full of any monthly payment amount set forth on a statement or revised statement is not received by the District on or before the close of business on the 20th day of the month, a delayed payment charge of 2% of the unpaid amount due will be made. Any bill which remains unpaid for more than 30 days after the due date shall, in addition to the delayed payment charge, accrue interest at the lesser of 1.5% per month or the maximum rate allowed by law. If the 20th calendar day of the month is a Saturday, Sunday or a District recognized holiday, the next following business day shall be the last day on which payment may be received without the addition of the delayed-payment charge. Additionally, if payment due to the District under this Section 6 remains unpaid 30 days after the due date, the District may thereafter suspend payment of the Purchaser Revenue Allocation to the Purchaser which would otherwise occur until payment in full of all amounts due and owing (including any interest and delay charges) is received by the District.

 (g) On or before 150 days after the end of each Contract Year, the District will submit to the Purchaser a detailed statement of the Purchaser Estimated Cost and the Purchaser Actual Cost for the Contract Year. Purchaser Actual Cost on such statement shall be calculated in the same manner as Purchaser Estimated Cost as set forth in Sections 6(a)(1)-(4) but using the actual costs incurred by the District in the preceding Contract Year; provided, however, that the estimated values calculated pursuant to Sections 4(b)(1)-(2) and 4(b)(5) shall not be modified. If the Purchaser Actual Costs exceed the Purchaser Estimated Costs on such statement ("Excess Costs"), the District shall bill the Purchaser for an amount equal to such Excess Costs, and the Purchaser shall pay such bill within 30 days or be subject to the delayed-payment and interest charges as provided in Section 6(f). If the Purchaser Actual Costs are less than the Purchaser Estimated Costs, or if credits are due pursuant to Section 5(b) or both ("Refund Costs"), the District shall give credit to the Purchaser against the Purchaser Estimated Costs for the current Contract Year in an amount equal to such Refund Costs; provided, that if Refund Costs are due to Purchaser following the expiration of this contract, the District shall make a cash refund of such amount to the Purchaser.

 (h) The District may use any payments received from the Purchaser under this contract in any manner that the District, in its sole discretion, shall determine. The District agrees to pay or cause to be paid for the Priest Rapids Project from lawfully available money of the District, including payments from the Purchaser and other Purchasers, all the operating costs, taxes and assessments, capital expenditures, payments required for Debt and other costs of the Priest Rapids Project. If the District issues tax-exempt Debt based on the governmental use of the Priest Rapids Project Output by the Purchaser, the Purchaser covenants that it shall not use any Priest Rapids Project Output in a manner, or take any other action, that will or is likely to adversely affect the tax-exempt status of any Debt.

 SECTION 7. SUPPORT AND COOPERATION. (a) The District shall make application and use reasonable efforts to obtain a New FERC License and obtain FERC approval of this contract, if required. The District reserves the right to determine when such applications should be made.

 (b) In accordance with FERC direction contained in the PL 83-544 Orders, the District commits to providing the Eligible Purchasers with a meaningful priority in the sale of the Reasonable Portion.

 (c) Purchasers may also participate in the development by the District of a proposed Marketing Plan. This Marketing Plan will be submitted to FERC for approval as part of the relicensing process application; provided, however, that nothing in this Section shall be construed as compelling the Purchaser to comment on or refrain from commenting on the Marketing Plan.

 (d) Purchaser covenants that it shall provide reasonable support, cooperation and assistance to the District in the District's acquisition of a New and Annual FERC License, any necessary federal, state or local permits relating to the Priest Rapids Project, FERC approval of this contract, if FERC approval is requested by the District; provided, however, that nothing in this contract shall preclude the Purchaser from filing comments with FERC to protect the Purchaser's economic benefits provided by this contract.

 (e) In the event that the District believes that the Purchaser has violated any of the above covenants of Section 7(d), the District may by written notice to the Purchaser describe the alleged violation in reasonable detail and give the Purchaser no less than 10 business days within which to cease the activity in question or to provide to the District a written explanation as to why the Purchaser believes the activity does not constitute a violation of any of the aforementioned covenants. If the Purchaser does not cure the alleged default and the District continues to consider the action to be in breach of the covenants, the matter shall be resolved pursuant to arbitration conducted under Section 23. If the Purchaser is determined to be in breach of the covenants, the District shall have the right to terminate this contract effective immediately upon written notice to the Purchaser, without any liability or further obligation on the part of the District. In the event of such termination, the District shall have the right to use or sell, in any manner the District determines, the Purchaser Revenue Allocation the Purchaser would have been otherwise entitled to under this contract.

 (f) Purchaser covenants that it shall refrain from filing or supporting any FERC license application for the Priest Rapids Project other than that filed by the District and refrain from filing or supporting any effort that would lead to modification of the FERC decisions on Public Law 83-544 contained in the PL 83- 544 Orders, unless such a request or petition is filed by the District and the Purchaser agrees with that request or petition. For purposes of this Section 7(f), "refrain from supporting" means prepare no documents, submit no testimony, sign no other agreement or contract other than this contract for Priest Rapids Project Output or for other products or that is contingent upon a party other than the District receiving a license from FERC to operate the Priest Rapids Project, engage in no lobbying and provide no funding.

 (g) The Purchaser covenants that it will not take any action which, in the opinion of a neutral third party, would likely be construed as: (i) having a material adverse effect on the District's ability to obtain an Annual FERC License or a New FERC License or on the anticipated economic benefits of this contract or (ii) constituting a judicial challenge to the authority of the District or the Purchaser to enter into and implement the provisions of this contract. This covenant does not apply to anticipated economic benefits under other agreements between the District and third parties, such as with the Bonneville Power Administration.

 (h) In the event that the District believes that the Purchaser has violated any of the above covenants of Section 7(f) or (g), the District may by written notice to the Purchaser describe the alleged violation in reasonable detail and give the Purchaser no less than 4 business days after receipt of such written notice by Purchaser within which to cease the activity in question or to provide to the District a written explanation as to why the Purchaser believes the activity does not constitute a violation of any of the aforementioned covenants. If the Purchaser does not cure the alleged default and the District continues to reasonably consider the action to be in breach of the covenants, the District shall have the right to terminate this contract and the 1956 and 1959 Contracts, effective immediately upon written notice to the Purchaser, without any liability or further obligation on the part of the District. In the event of such termination, the District shall have the right to use or sell, in any manner the District determines, the Purchaser Revenue Allocation the Purchaser would have been otherwise entitled to under this contract and any output from the Priest Rapids Project under the 1956 or 1959 Contracts.

 SECTION 8. PAYMENT OF THE REASONABLE PORTION PROCEEDS. (a) The Purchaser Revenue Allocation of the Reasonable Portion Proceeds shall be paid to the Purchaser monthly, as follows:

 (1) The monthly payment to the Purchaser shall be the product of the Purchaser Revenue Allocation and the difference between the actual monthly payments of the Reasonable Portion Proceeds received by the District and the monthly Estimated District Power Costs pursuant to Section 4(b)(4). Nothing in this Section 8(a)(1) will result in a negative payment or a bill to the Purchaser when such Estimated District Power Costs exceed the actual monthly Reasonable Portion Proceeds received by the District.

 (2) Payments due from the District to Purchaser pursuant to Section 8(a)(1) shall be made in accordance with the provisions of Section 6, and such payment shall be due not later than the 20th calendar day of each month.

 (3) During the term of this contract, the District may be entitled to take during a Contract Year all of the Reasonable Portion Proceeds pursuant to Section 4(c) resulting in a zero payment to purchaser ("Zero Year"). If in any Zero Year the District has in place one or more multiple year contracts, the terms of which include or span the Zero Year ("Multi-Year Contracts"), then the payments to the Purchaser from such Multi-Year Contracts included in the calculations performed pursuant to Section 4(d) shall be proportional to the annual market price of power as forecast at the time the Multi-Year Contracts were agreed to by the District.

 (4) If in any month the Estimated District Power Costs from Section 4(b)(4) exceed the actual Reasonable Portion Proceeds received in such month ("Estimated Power Cost Shortfall"), the Estimated Power Cost Shortfall shall be carried forward to the next month or months remaining in the Contract Year in which such Estimated Power Cost Shortfall occurred until paid in full from the Reasonable Portion Proceeds received by the District.

 SECTION 9. INFORMATION TO BE MADE AVAILABLE TO THE PURCHASER. (a) The District agrees to keep records of the Priest Rapids Project in accordance with the Uniform System of Accounts as prescribed by FERC for electric utilities and licensees; provided, if there are inconsistencies between the Uniform System of Accounts and this contract, this contract shall control.

 (b) The Parties agree that any compensation (whether energy or money) due or which may become due the owner of the Rock Island Hydroelectric Project because of encroachment by the Priest Rapids Project after November 1, 2009 on the Rock Island Hydroelectric Project will either proportionately reduce the amount of Priest Rapids Project Output or be included in Annual Power Costs, as appropriate, but shall not reduce the amount required to be paid by the Purchaser under Sections 5 and 6. "Rock Island Hydroelectric Project" shall mean the FERC Hydroelectric Project No. 943 currently operated by Public Utility District No. 1 of Chelan County, Washington.

 SECTION 12. LIABILITY OF PARTIES. (a) Except as otherwise provided in this contract, each Party hereby releases the other Party and its commissioners, officers, directors, agents and employees from any claim for loss or damage arising out of the ownership, operation, and maintenance of the Priest Rapids Project including any loss of profits or revenues, loss of use of power system, cost of capital, cost of purchased or replacement power, other substantially similar liability or other direct or indirect consequential loss or damage, except as provided in the Agreement Limiting Liability Among Western Interconnected Systems for parties to that agreement.

 (3) The District may, prior to the termination of this contract pursuant to Section 17(b)(2), at any time suspend any and all rights of the Purchaser to the Purchaser Revenue Allocation upon not less than five days' notice to the Purchaser. The District may, without further notice to the Purchaser, grant any or all of such suspended rights to any person or entity for the duration of the suspension. In such event, the Purchaser shall, in addition to its other obligations under this contract, upon demand, pay to the District all expenses and any losses incurred in connection with such suspension and any grant of the suspended rights to another person or entity. No suspension of any or all of the rights of the Purchaser Revenue Allocation shall be construed as an election to terminate the interests of the Purchaser in, to, and under this contract unless a written notice of termination is given to the Purchaser pursuant to this contract or unless such termination be decreed by a court of competent jurisdiction.

 (4) The non-defaulting Party may begin and maintain successive proceedings against the defaulting Party for the recovery of damages or for a sum equal to any and all payments required to be made pursuant to this contract.

 (5) A Party may take whatever action at law or in equity as may appear necessary or desirable to collect the amounts payable by the defaulting Party under this contract then due and thereafter to become due, or to enforce performance and observation of any obligation, agreement or covenant of the defaulting Party under this contract.

 (6) No right or remedy conferred upon or reserved to a Party is intended to be exclusive of any other right or remedy, and each and every right and remedy shall be cumulative and in addition to any other right or remedy given hereunder, or now or hereafter legally existing, upon the occurrence of any Act of Default. Failure of the District to insist at any time on the strict observance or performance by the Purchaser of any of the provisions of this contract, or to exercise any right or remedy provided for in this contract shall not impair any such right or remedy nor be construed as a waiver or relinquishment thereof for the future. Receipt by the District of any payment required to be made hereunder with knowledge of the breach of any provisions of this contract shall not be deemed a waiver of such breach. In addition to all other remedies provided in this contract, the District shall be entitled, to the extent permitted by applicable law, to injunctive relief in case of the violation, or attempted or threatened violation, of any of the provisions of this contract, or to a decree requiring performance of any of the provisions of this contract or to any other remedy legally allowed to the District.

 (7) The District shall not have the right to accelerate future payment obligations of the Purchaser in the event of default under this contract.

 SECTION 18. VENUE AND ATTORNEY FEES. Venue of any action filed to enforce or interpret the provisions of this contract shall be exclusively in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Washington or the Superior Court of the State of Washington for Grant County and the Parties irrevocably submit to the jurisdiction of any such court. In the event of litigation to enforce the provisions of this contract, the prevailing Party shall be entitled to reasonable attorney's fees in addition to any other relief allowed.

 SECTION 19. COMPLIANCE WITH LAW. The Parties shall conform to and comply with all laws, rules, regulations, license conditions or restrictions promulgated by the FERC or any other governmental agency or entity having jurisdiction over the Priest Rapids Project. The Purchaser shall cooperate and take whatever action is necessary to cooperate fully with the District in meeting such requirements. Obligations of the District contained in this contract are hereby expressly made subordinate and subject to such compliance.

 SECTION 20. HEADINGS. The headings of sections and paragraphs of this contract are for convenience of reference only and are not intended to restrict, affect or be of any weight in the interpretation or construction of the provisions of such sections and paragraphs.

 SECTION 21. ENTIRE AGREEMENT; MODIFICATION; CONFLICT IN PRECEDENCE. This contract does not modify the terms and conditions contained in the 1956 and 1959 Contracts except as provided in Sections 1(b) and 7. This contract constitutes the entire agreement between the Parties with respect to the subject matter of this contract, and supersedes all previous communications between the Parties, either verbal or written, with respect to such subject matter. No modifications of this contract shall be binding upon the Parties unless such modifications are in writing signed by each Party. To the extent there are any conflicting provisions between this contract and the 1956 Contract, or this contract and the 1959 Contract after November 1, 2009, the terms and conditions in this contract shall take precedence and be controlling and the 1956 and 1959 Contracts are hereby amended accordingly.

 SECTION 22. NO PARTNERSHIP OR THIRD PARTY RIGHTS. (a) This contract shall not be interpreted or construed to create an association, joint venture or partnership between the Parties, or to impose any partnership obligations or liability upon any Party. Without limiting the foregoing, the Purchaser shall not be liable for, and the District hereby releases the Purchaser from, the payment of Debt except as provided in Sections 5 and 6.

 (b) In addition to other matters subject to arbitration pursuant to other provisions of this contract, if approved by members of the Committee whose Purchaser Revenue Allocations total 66% or more, the Committee may submit to binding arbitration the following issues:

 (1) Have the Estimated District Loads been forecast in accordance with Prudent Utility Practice and, if not, what is the appropriate Estimated District Loads in accordance with Prudent Utility Practice for the Contract Year?

 (2) Have the Annual Power Costs been determined by the District in accordance with Prudent Utility Practice and have such costs been incurred for the benefit of Priest Rapids Project Output and, if not, what are the appropriate Annual Power Costs in accordance with Prudent Utility Practice for the Contract Year; provided that nothing in this Section shall be interpreted to limit the ability of the District to meet its payment obligations under a Bond Resolution?

 (3) What modifications to this contract, pursuant to Section 3(f), are necessary to comply with FERC or court orders and to preserve the basic benefits and obligations of the Parties?

 (4) Has the Purchaser violated the covenants in Section 7(e)?

 (5) Are the annual proceeds from the sales of the Reasonable Portion pursuant to Multi-Year Contracts proportional to the annual market price of power, as forecast at the time the Multi-Year Contracts were agreed to by the District, and if not, what adjustments are necessary to the payments to Purchaser pursuant to Section 4(d) to reflect such forecast annual market price of power for sales made pursuant to such Multi-Year Contracts?

 (c) The board of arbitrators shall be composed of three persons, one of whom shall be appointed by the District, one of whom shall be appointed by majority vote of the Committee, and the third person to be appointed by the two persons so appointed. The District and the Committee shall appoint their arbitrator within 15 days after notification of the Committee's vote to submit a matter to binding arbitration. In the event the two members cannot agree upon the appointment of a third person within 10 days, then such third person shall be appointed by the presiding judge of the Superior Court of Kittitas County, Washington. The arbitration shall be conducted jointly by the participating Purchasers, and under rules as may be determined by the arbitrators; provided, however, that all parties shall be afforded discovery consistent with the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure; and, provided further, if the arbitrators do not unanimously agree on the rules governing the arbitration, the arbitration shall be conducted in accordance with the Commercial Arbitration Rules of the American Arbitration Association.

 PUBLIC UTILITY DISTRICT NO. 2 OF GRANT COUNTY, WASHINGTON By President (SEAL) ATTEST: Secretary

 THE CITY OF SEATTLE, CITY LIGHT DEPARTMENT By: ________________________________ Gary Zarker Superintendent (SEAL) ATTEST: Secretary t AMENDMENT NO. 1 TO THE ADDITIONAL PRODUCTS SALES AGREEMENT

 The Public Utility District No. 2 of Grant County, Washington, ("District"), and the City of Seattle, acting by and through its City Light Department ("Purchaser"), hereby agree to this Amendment No. 1 to the Additional Products Sales Agreement dated March __, 2002 (the "Product Agreement"). Unless otherwise defined herein, all capitalized terms defined in the Product Agreement shall have the meanings set forth therein when used in this Amendment.

 1. Term of Amendment No. 1

 This Amendment No. 1 shall take effect on upon the execution by the District and Purchaser, and shall expire on the earlier of the expiration or termination date of the Product Agreement.

 2. Amendments to Provisions of the Product Agreement

 Purchaser and the District agree that the Product Agreement is hereby amended as follows:

 2.1 The first paragraph of Section 2 of Exhibit 1 is amended by adding after the last sentence thereof the following:

 The amount of Non-Firm Generation Product available to Purchaser shall equal the product of Purchaser's Share and the Non-Firm Generation Product.

 2.2 The second paragraph of Section 3 of Exhibit 1 is deleted in its entirety and is replaced with the following:

 The amount of Non-Firm Generation Product for each day is the Project Non-Firm Generation for such day multiplied by a percentage equal to 100% less the sum of all Purchaser Power Allocations from all of the Priest Rapids Project Product Sales Contracts, less the Reasonable Portion and less 36.5%. For purposes of such calculation, Project Non-Firm Generation shall be the actual energy generation (in mwhrs) of the Priest Rapids Project Output less the firm energy calculated pursuant to Section 5(b)(2) of the Priest Rapids Project Product Sales Contract, times the shaping factors described below. For example, based on current operating requirements of the Priest Rapids Project, the Project Firm Generation is distributed on a shaped basis over the week, using a factor of 1.08 for Monday through Friday, and a factor of 0.8 for Saturdays and Sundays. These factors will be changed by the District to reflect changes in operating constraints applicable to the Priest Rapids Project. In the event that the calculation of Project Non-firm Generation is less than zero, there will be no obligation on the part of the Purchaser to schedule Non- Firm Generation Product back to the District, but such negative amount will be included in the deviation account.

 2.3 The third paragraph of Section 3 of Exhibit 1 is deleted in its entirety and is replaced with the following:

 For example: Assume that flows during the week are 324 MW and that flows during the weekend are 240 MW. If firm energy (critical generation) is 250 MW then Project Non-Firm Generation on Monday through Friday would be 324-(250*1.08)=54 MW times 24 hours =1,296 MWh for each weekday. The amount of power scheduled during the weekend would be 240-(250*0.8)=40 MW times 24 hours = 960 MWh for each weekend day.

 2.4 The fourth and fifth sentences of the fourth paragraph of Section 3 of Exhibit 1 are revised as follows:

 Whenever they appear in such sentences, the phrase "Estimated Purchaser's Non-Firm" is revised to read "Estimated Purchaser's Non- Firm Generation Product", and the phrase "Purchaser's Non-Firm" is revised to read "Purchaser's Non-Firm Generation Product".

 2.5 The second paragraph of Section 5(a) of Exhibit 1 is deleted in its entirety and is replaced with the following:

 Upon notice to the District by January 1, 2003, the Purchaser may make a one-time irrevocable exchange of their entire share of Non- Firm Generation Product for Load Following Product on the basis of 1.5 megawatts of Load Following Product for each average annual megawatt of Non-Firm Generation Product. For the purpose of the calculation of this exchange, the Project Non-firm Generation shall be calculated pursuant to Operating Agreements based on the average historical river flows.

 For purposes of determining Purchaser's entitlement to Load Following Product, the exchange ratio set forth above shall be applied to the amount of Non-Firm Generation Product initially available to Purchaser hereunder, but such ratio shall be applied in subsequent years to any increased amount of Non-Firm Generation Product to which the Purchaser would have been entitled absent its election hereunder.

 2.6 Section 5 of Exhibit 1 is amended by adding a new subsection 5(f) as follows:

 If the one-time exchange has been made as provided in this section 5, Purchaser's compensation to the District for the Load Following Product shall be limited to the return of energy and the charges set forth in Sections 5(c), (d) and (e). Purchaser shall not be required to pay to the District as compensation for the Load Following Product any portion of the Annual Power Costs of the Priest Rapids Project pursuant to section 4 of this Exhibit 1.

 2.7 The Product Agreement is amended by adding a new Exhibit 2, Purchasers Product Percentage Allocations, which is attached hereto.

 In Witness Whereof, Purchaser and the District have caused this Amendment No. 1 to be executed in their respective names by their duly authorized officers.

 THE CITY OF SEATTLE, PUBLIC UTILITY DISTRICT NO. 2 OF CITY LIGHT DEPARTMENT GRANT COUNTY, WASHINGTON By: _________________ By: ____________________________ Gary Zarker Title: Superintendent Title: ___________________________ Date Signed: ________ Date Signed: _____________________ t

 EXHIBIT 1

 NON-FIRM GENERATION PRODUCT

 (and exchange for Load Following Product)

 Except as otherwise provided in this Exhibit 1 or in the Agreement, terms used herein with initial capitalization shall have the meanings set forth in Section 2 of the Priest Rapids Project Product Sales Contract.

 1. Non-Firm Generation Product Description

 The Non-Firm Generation Product is a portion of the non-firm energy available to the District from the Priest Rapids Project as and when such energy is available, as determined by the District.

 2. Purchasers Share of Non-Firm Generation Product

 The District will make available Purchaser's Share (defined below) of the Non-Firm Generation Product that the District determines is available each day during the term of this Agreement in accordance with this Exhibit 1. The Purchaser's Share shall be the Purchaser's percent participation in the 1956 Contract divided by 63.5% from November 1, 2005 through October 31, 2009 after which it shall be the average of the Purchaser's participation in the 1956 and 1959 Contracts divided by 63.5%.

 As part of the pro forma statement provided to Purchaser pursuant to Section 5(b) of the Priest Rapids Project Product Sales Contract, the District shall provide to Purchaser an estimate for the next Contract Year of the amount of Priest Rapids Project Non-Firm Generation by month that the Priest Rapids Project is expected to produce based on information available at the time such estimate is prepared.

 3. Availability of Non-Firm Generation Product

 The Non-Firm Generation Product will be available commencing November 1, 2005.

 The amount of Non-Firm Generation Product for each day is the Project Non-Firm Generation for such day multiplied by a percentage equal to 100% less the sum of all Purchaser Power Allocations from all of the Priest Rapids Project Product Sales Contracts, less the Reasonable Portion and less 36.5%. For purposes of such calculation, Project Non-Firm Generation is the actual energy generation (in mwhrs) of the Priest Rapids Project Output less the product of firm energy calculated pursuant to Section 5(b)(2) of the Priest Rapids Project Product Sales Contract, distributed on a shaped basis over each day, and a factor of 1.08 for Monday through Friday, and a factor of 0.8 for Saturdays and Sundays. In the event that the calculation of Project Non-firm Generation is less than zero, the actual Non-firm Generation will be zero.

 For example: If firm energy is 250 mw and actual generation is 300 mw, then Project Non-Firm Generation on Monday through Friday would be 300-(250*1.08)=30 mw. Project Non-Firm Generation on Saturday and Sunday would be 300-(250*0.8)=100 mw.

 The District will estimate the Purchaser's Non-firm Generation Product on a daily preshedule basis according to available data ("Estimated Purchaser's Non-firm"). On Monday through Saturday, such schedule shall be delivered with the same amount of megawatt-hours delivered in Heavy Load Hours as in Light Load Hours. On Sundays, such schedule shall be delivered in equal hourly amounts over all 24 hours. On an after-the-fact basis, the District will compute the amount of Purchaser's Non-firm and will maintain a deviation account to track the difference in the daily Estimated Purchaser's Non-firm and the actual Purchaser's Non-firm. Positive and negative balances in the deviation account will be used to adjust the daily Estimated Purchaser's Non-firm that is delivered on a preschedule basis. Positive and negative balances will carry through from month to month.

 Preschedule deliveries to Purchasers will be reduced or eliminated in realtime in the event of a contingency that reduces or eliminates the District's ability to generate the daily Estimated Purchaser's Non-firm at the Priest Rapids Project.

 4. Pricing and Payment

 For each Contract Year during the term of this Agreement, the Purchaser shall pay the District in twelve equal monthly installments the product of the estimated Annual Power Cost contained in the pro forma statement prepared pursuant to Section 7(a) of the Priest Rapids Project Product Sales Contract and the ratio of Purchaser Estimated Non-Firm to the average total generation of the Priest Rapids Project estimated pursuant to the Operating Agreements. The pro forma statement provided to purchaser pursuant to Section 7(a) of the Priest Rapids Project Product Sales Contract shall separately set forth the Purchaser's estimated monthly payment obligation for Non-Firm Generation Product for the next Contract Year.

 The payments made by Purchaser for the Non-Firm Generation Product on an estimated basis will be trued up to actual values not later than 150 days after end of each Contract Year using actual Annual Power Costs prepared pursuant to Section 7(g) of the Priest Rapids Project Product Sales Contract, and actual metered amounts of Non- Firm Generation Product. Any amounts due to Purchaser will be credited against Purchaser's payment obligation in the then current Contract Year, and any amounts due from Purchaser to the District will be invoiced to Purchaser, all in accordance with such Section 7(g).

 5. Exchange of Non-Firm Generation Product for Load Following Product

 (a) Exchange Defined - The Load Following Product provides capacity and associated energy for short periods of time. The Purchaser then returns the same amount of energy within 168 hours.

 Upon notice to the District by January 1, 2003, the Purchaser may make a one-time irrevocable exchange of their entire share of Non-Firm Generation Product for Load Following Product on the basis of 1.5 megawatts of Load Following Product for each megawatt of Non-Firm Generation Product. For the purpose of this calculation of this exchange the Project Non-firm Generation shall be calculated pursuant to Operating Agreements based on the average historical river flows.

 The total amount exchanged by all Purchasers shall not exceed the Monthly Maximum Load Following Product defined below which shall be allocated on a first come first served basis. The Purchaser's Share of Load Following Product will be the ratio of the number of megawatts of Non-firm Generation Product exchanged by an individual Purchaser to the total exchanged by all Purchasers.

 (b) Availability - The Load Following Product will be available commencing November 1, 2005. Load Following Product will be available only after all other obligations of the Priest Rapids Project, including but not limited to, meeting and following the District's loads, meeting commercial arrangements entered into prior to this Agreement, requirements of Operating Agreements, meeting regulatory requirements, and after accounting for water conditions and the status of the Priest Rapids Project. Notwithstanding the table below the amount of Load Following Product will be reduced if the District is unable to meet these obligations or if it would otherwise be forced to the market to buy Load Following Product.

 The monthly Maximum Load Following Product will be 50 megawatts from November 2005 through October 31, 2009 or 100 megawatts after October 31, 2009 and associated energy.

 On or before the tenth day preceding each month the District will identify to the Purchaser the estimated Monthly Minimum Load Following Product (in megawatts) that the District expects to be available during the next month, but will not be less than the firm amounts shown below.

 2005-2009 Nov. Dec. Jan. Feb. Mar. Apr. May Jun. Jul. Aug. Sep. Oct. 0 50 50 50 50 0 25 25 50 50 50 0

 2009 forward Nov. Dec. Jan. Feb. Mar. Apr. May Jun. Jul. Aug. Sep. Oct. 100 100 100 100 100 50 100 100 100 100 100 100

 Each day, the District shall provide the Purchaser with the Daily Load Following Product (in megawatts) that the District determines will be available for the subsequent preschedule day or days. The actual Daily Load Following Product shall be between the Monthly Minimum Load following Product and the Monthly Maximum Load Following product.

 The Purchaser's Load Following Product shall be the lesser of the amount of Load Following Product exchanged pursuant to Section 5a of this Exhibit 1 or the Daily Load Following Product times the Purchaser's Share.

 (c) Return of Energy - Energy associated with the Load Following Product used by Purchaser shall be returned to the District in like quantities (hour for hour) on like days 168 hours after the delivery by the District to the Purchaser. Energy returned to the District shall be delivered at the District's Point of Delivery as specified in Section 7 of this Exhibit 1.

 If, in real-time, the District determines that Purchaser's schedule of return energy to the District is in excess of the estimated Purchaser's Load Following Product in future hours, and that such excess will cause spill, then District may, at its option, require the Purchaser to reduce its schedule. Purchaser shall reduce its schedule by such excess amount. Purchaser shall schedule the remaining energy to the District at the earliest time possible for both District and Purchaser.

 District shall meter the actual Load Following Product used to meet Purchasers load signal in each hour.

 (d) Charge for Spill - The District will charge the Purchaser for any spill allocated to the District if it is determined by the District that such spill was directly attributable to the actions of the Purchaser under this Agreement. Such charge will equal the product of such spill (in megawatt-hours) and the Market Energy Rate for the daily diurnal period in which such spill occurred.

 Market Energy Rate shall mean the rate (in $/mwhr) at which firm energy is available on the wholesale power market, for quantities comparable to the spill caused by the actions of Purchaser, during the diurnal period that the spill occurred, as determined by the District.

 (e) Excess Load Following Product and Energy Not Returned - In the event that Purchaser takes in any hour Load Following Product in excess of its Purchaser's Share, Purchaser shall be subject to a charge equal to 150% of the Mid-C Market Capacity Rate for the daily diurnal period in which the Load Following Product was taken times the amount of Load Following Product (in megawatts) taken in excess of Purchaser's Share.

 Market Capacity Rate shall mean the rate (in $/mw-mo.) as quoted by the Bonneville Power Administration, for quantities comparable to the Load Following Product made available to Purchasers, during the diurnal period that Purchaser took Load Following Product in excess of its Purchaser's Share.

 In the event that Purchaser does not return energy associated with Load Following Product delivered by Purchaser, then Purchaser shall be considered in Default pursuant to Section 22 of the Priest Rapids Project Product Sales Contract.

 6. Billing

 Purchaser shall pay the amounts set forth in the pro forma statement provided to Purchaser pursuant to section 7(a) of the Priest Rapids Project Product Sales Contract.

 Not later than ten (10) days after the end of each month during the term, the District will prepare and provide to the Purchaser an invoice setting forth the payment due from Purchaser to the District for the Load Following Product made available for the preceding month.

 7. Points of Delivery

 The District shall make available to the Purchaser the Non-Firm Generation Product at the Points of Delivery specified in Section 11 of the Priest Rapids Project Product Sales Contract.

 The District shall make available to the Purchaser the Load Following Product and associated energy, and Purchaser shall return energy to the District, at the Points of Delivery specified in Section 11 of the Priest Rapids Project Product Sales Contract.

 8. Metering, Transmission and Losses

 Metering, transmission and losses will be in accordance with Section 12 of the Priest Rapids Project Product Sales Contract.

 9. Information and Communications

 Purchaser shall be responsible for the costs of installing and maintaining any communications equipment necessary to effectuate the delivery of the Non-Firm Generation Product or Load Following Product between the District and the Purchaser.

 10. Scheduling and Accounting

 Scheduling and accounting shall be performed according to then current industry standards. t
