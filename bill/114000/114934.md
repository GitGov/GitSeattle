 Notes for Default Table 10-5B(2)

 1. It is acceptable to use the U-factors in Table 10-5B(2) for all concrete and masonry walls, provided that the grouting is equal to or less than that specified.

 - For ungrouted walls, use the partially-grouted column.

 - For metal studs and z-furring, use the continuous-metal-framing category.

 - For discontinuous metal clips 1 inch square or smaller, use the metal-clip category.

 - For insulation that is attached without any framing members (e.g. glued), use the continuous-insulation-uninterrupted-by-framing category. Continuous insulation may be installed on the interior or exterior of masonry walls, or between stand-alone walls in multi-layer masonry walls, or on the interior or exterior of the concrete.

 2. For Table 10-5B(2), the U-factor includes R-0.17 for exterior air film and R-0.68 for interior air film - vertical surfaces. For insulated walls, the U-factor also includes R-0.45 for 0.5 in. gypsum board. U-factors are provided for the following configurations:

(a) Concrete wall: 8-in. normal weight concrete wall with a density of 145 lb/ft3.

(b) Solid grouted concrete block wall: 8-in. medium weight ASTM C90 concrete block with a density of 115 lb/ft3 and solid grouted cores.

(c) Partially grouted concrete block wall: 8-in. medium weight ASTM C90 concrete block with a density of 115 lb/ft3 having reinforcing steel every 32 in. vertically and every 48 in. horizontally, with cores grouted in those areas only. Other cores are filled with insulating material only if there is no other insulation.  3. For walls with insulation contained in a framing layer, the U- factors in Table 10-5B(2) assume contact (and thermal bridging) between the mass wall and other framing. For wall assemblies with multiple layers where the wood or metal framing layer does not contact the concrete or masonry layer (i.e. walls with an airspace between the stud wall layer and the mass wall layer), it is acceptable to use the appropriate wood or metal frame wall default U-factors in Tables 10-5 or 10-5A. Note, it is acceptable to use this approach where the insulation extends beyond the framing and is in contact with the mass wall layer (e.g. a nominal four-inch metal stud containing insulation that is nominally six inches thick and therefore extends two inches beyond the back of the metal stud).

 4. Except for wall assemblies qualifying for note 3, if not taken from Table 10-5B(2), mass wall U-factors shall be determined in accordance with ASHRAE/IESNA Standard 90.1-2001, Appendix A, Section A3.1 and Tables A-5 to A-8, or Section A9.4. If not taken from Table 10-9, heat capacity for mass walls shall be taken from ASHRAE/IESNA Standard 90.1-2001, Appendix A, Table A-6 or A-7.

 Section 7. Section 1132.3 of the 2003 Washington State Energy Code is amended as follows:

 1132.3 Lighting and Motors:  Where the use in a space changes from one use in Table 15-1 to another use in Table 15-1, the installed lighting wattage shall comply with Section 1521 or 1531.

Other ~~T~~tenant improvements, alterations or repairs where 60% or more of the fixtures in a space enclosed by walls or ceiling-height partitions ~~use (as defined in Table 15- 1) within a tenant space or in an entire floor (whichever is smaller)~~are new shall comply with Sections 1531 and 1532. (Where this threshold is triggered, the areas of the affected spaces may be aggregated for code compliance calculations.)

 Where less than 60% of the fixtures in a space enclosed by walls or ceiling-height partitions are new, the installed lighting wattage shall be maintained or reduced. Where 60% or more of the lighting fixtures in a suspended ceiling are new, and the existing insulation is on the suspended ceiling, the roof/ceiling assembly shall be insulated according to the provisions of Chapter 13, Section 1311.2.

 Where new wiring is being installed to serve added fixtures and/or fixtures are being relocated to a new circuit (except as noted in the following paragraph), controls shall comply with Sections 1513.1 through 1513.5 and 1513.7. For compliance with Section 1513.3.2 for existing luminaires where the existing ballasts are not being changed, the number of required incremental steps of automatic daylighting control shall be equal to one plus the number of ballasts in the luminaire.

 Those motors which are altered or replaced shall comply with Section 1511.

 Section 8. Section 1133 of the 2003 Washington State Energy Code is amended as follows:

 1133 Change of Occupancy or Use: Changes of occupancy or use shall comply with the following requirements:

 a. Any unconditioned space that is altered to become semi-heated, cooled, or fully heated, or any semi-heated space that is altered to become cooled or fully heated space shall be required to be brought into full compliance with this Code. For spaces constructed prior to this Code, the installed heating output capacity shall not exceed 16 Btu/h per square foot unless the building envelope complies with the requirements of Chapter 13. Existing warehouses and repair shops are considered unconditioned space unless they are indicated as conditioned space in DPD records or they were built after 1980 and they comply with the building envelope requirements for conditioned space in effect at the time of construction. (See the Seattle Mechanical Code for requirements for combustion appliances.)

 b. Any Group R occupancy which is converted to other than a Group R occupancy shall be required to comply with all of the provisions of Sections 1130 through 1132 of this Code.

 Section 9. Section 1144 of the 2003 Washington State Energy Code is amended as follows:

 1144 Violations and Penalties~~:It shall be a violation of this Code for any person, firm, or corporation to erect or construct any building, or remodel or rehabilitate any existing building or structure in the state, or allow the same to be done, contrary to any of the provisions of this Code.~~

 Section 10. The Energy Code is amended by adding new Sections 1144.1, 1144.2, 1144.3, 1144.4, 1144.5, 1144.6, and 1144.7 to read as follows:

 1144.1 Violations: It shall be a violation of this Code for any person, firm or corporation to erect, construct, enlarge, repair, move, improve, remove, convert, demolish, equip, occupy, inspect or maintain any building or structure in the City, contrary to or in violation of any of the provisions of this Code.

 It shall be a violation of this Code for any person, firm or corporation to knowingly aid, abet, counsel, encourage, hire, commend, induce or otherwise procure another to violate or fail to comply with this Code.

 It shall be a violation of this Code for any person, firm, or corporation to use any material or to install any device, appliance or equipment which does not comply with the applicable standards of this Code or which has not been approved by the building official.

 1144.2 Notice of Violation: If after investigation the building official determines that standards or requirements of this code have been violated, the building official may serve a notice of violation upon the owner or other person responsible for the action or condition. The notice of violation shall state the standards or requirements violated, shall state what corrective action, if any, is necessary to comply with the standards or requirements, and shall set a reasonable time for compliance. The notice shall be served upon the owner or other responsible person by regular first class mail addressed to the last known address of such person. In addition, a copy of the notice may be posted at a conspicuous place on the property. The notice of violation shall be considered an order of the building official. Nothing in this subsection shall be deemed to limit or preclude any action or proceeding pursuant to Sections 102, 103 or 104 of the Seattle Building Code, and nothing in this section shall be deemed to obligate or require the building official to issue a notice of violation prior to the imposition of civil or criminal penalties in this section.

 1144.3 Civil Penalties: Any person, firm or corporation failing to comply with the provisions of this code shall be subject to a cumulative civil penalty in an amount not to exceed $500 per day for each violation from the date the violation occurs or begins until compliance is achieved. In cases where the building official has issued a notice of violation, the violation will be deemed to begin, for purposes of determining the number of days of violation, on the date compliance is required by notice of violation. In any civil action for a penalty, the City has the burden of proving by a preponderance of the evidence that a violation exists or existed; the issuance of the notice of violation or of an order following a review by the Director is not itself evidence that a violation exists.

 1144.4 Criminal Penalty: Any person who violates or fails to comply with this chapter shall be guilty of a gross misdemeanor subject to the provisions of Chapters 12A.02 and 12A.04, except that absolute liability shall be imposed for such a violation or failure to comply and none of the mental states described in Section 12A.04.030 need be proved. The Director may request the City Attorney prosecute such violations criminally as an alternative to the civil penalty provision outlined in this code. Each day any person, firm or corporation shall continue to violate or fail to comply with the provisions of this chapter and each occurrence of a prohibited activity shall constitute a separate offense.

 1144.5 Additional Relief: The building official may seek legal or equitable relief to enjoin any acts or practices and abate any condition which constitutes a violation of this code when civil or criminal penalties are inadequate to effect compliance. In any such action, the City has the burden of proving by a preponderance of the evidence that a violation exists or will exist; the issuance of the notice of violation or of an order following a review by the Director is not itself evidence that a violation exists or will exist.

 1144.6 Notices: It shall be unlawful for any person to remove, mutilate, destroy or conceal any notice issued or posted by the building official pursuant to the provisions of this code, or any notice issued or posted by the building official in response to a natural disaster or other emergency.

 The building official may record a copy of any order or notice with the Department of Records and Elections of King County.

 The building official may record with the Department of Records and Elections of King County a notification that a permit has expired without a final inspection after reasonable efforts have been made to provide a final inspection.

 1144.7 Review by the Director

 1144.7.1. Any person affected by a notice of violation issued by the Director pursuant to Section 1144.2 may obtain a review of the notice by requesting such review in writing within ten days after service of the notice. When the last day of the period computed is a Saturday, Sunday, federal or City holiday, the period shall run until 5:00 p.m. of the next business day. Upon receipt of a request, the Director shall notify the person requesting the review of the date, time, and place of the Director's review. The review shall be not less than ten nor more than twenty days after the request is received, unless otherwise agreed by the person requesting the review. Any person affected by the notice of violation may submit any written material to the Director on or before the date of the review.

 1144.7.2. The review will consist of an informal review meeting held at the Department. A representative of the Director who is familiar with the case and the applicable regulations will attend. The Director's representative will consider any information presented by the persons attending and in the Department's enforcement file. At or after the review, the Director shall issue an order of the Director that may:

 1. Sustain the notice of violation; or

 2. Withdraw the notice of violation; or

 3. Continue the review to a future date; or

 4. Amend the notice of violation.

 1144.7.3. The Director shall issue an order of the Director within a reasonable time after the conclusion of the review. The Director shall mail the order by regular first-class mail to the person or persons named in the notice of violation.

 Section 11. Section 1150 of the 2003 Washington State Energy Code is amended as follows:

 1150 Conflicts with Other Codes: In case of conflicts among Codes enumerated in RCW 19.27.031 subsections (1), (2), (3) and (4) and this Code, the first named Code shall govern. The duct insulation requirements in this Code or a local jurisdiction's energy code, whichever is more stringent, supersede the requirements in the Uniform Mechanical Code.

This Code is intended to supplement the provisions of the Seattle Building Code, the Seattle Mechanical Code, and the Seattle Electrical Code, and in cases of conflict between this Code and any of those codes, the provisions of those codes shall apply.

Additional efficiency standards for electrical energy use may also appear in Seattle City Light service requirements, which should be consulted.

 Where, in any specific case, different sections of this Code specify different materials, methods of construction or other requirements, the most restrictive shall govern. Where there is a conflict between a general requirement and a specific requirement, the specific requirement shall be applicable.

 Section 12. Section 1161 of the 2003 Washington State Energy Code is amended as follows:

 1161 Severability: If any provision of this Code or its application to any person or circumstance is held invalid, the remainder of this Code or the application of the provision to other persons or circumstances is not affected.

The legislative body hereby declares that it would have passed this Code, and each section, subsection, clause or phrase thereof, irrespective of the fact that any one or more sections, subsections, sentences, clauses, and phrases be declared unconstitutional.

 Section 13. Section 1162 of the 2003 Washington State Energy Code is amended as follows:

 1162 Liability: Nothing contained in this Code is intended to be nor shall be construed to create or form the basis for any liability on the part of ~~any city or county~~the City or its officers, employees or agents for any injury or damage resulting from the failure of a building to conform to the provisions of this Code, or by reason of or in consequence of any inspection, notice, order, certificate, permission of approval authorized or issued or done in connection with the implementation or enforcement of this Code, or by reason of any action or inaction on the part of the City related in any manner to the enforcement of this Code or by its officers or agents. The building official or any employee charged with the enforcement of this Code, acting in good faith and without malice for the City in the discharge of his/her duties, shall not thereby render himself/herself liable personally and he/she is hereby relieved from all personal liability for any damage that may accrue to persons or property as a result of any act required or by reason of any act or omission in the discharge of his/her duties.

 Section 14. Section 1301 of the 2003 Washington State Energy Code is amended as follows:

 1301 Scope: Conditioned buildings or portions thereof shall be constructed to provide the required thermal performance of the various components according to the requirements of this chapter. Unless otherwise approved by the building official, all spaces shall be assumed to be at least semi-heated.

 EXCEPTIONS:

 1. Greenhouses isolated from any conditioned space and not intended for occupancy.

 2. As approved by the building official, spaces not assumed to be at least semi-heated.

 3. Unconditioned Group U occupancy accessory to Group R occupancy.

 4. Unstaffed equipment shelters or cabinets used solely for personal wireless service facilities.

5. Parking lot attendant booths no larger than 100 square feet, provided that the roof insulation is R-21 minimum and the wall insulation is R-13 minimum, unless otherwise allowed by Section 1310.

 Section 15. Section 1310 of the 2003 Washington State Energy Code is amended as follows:

 1310 General Requirements. The building envelope shall comply with Sections 1311 through 1314.

~~1310.1 Conditioned Spaces:~~ The building envelope for all conditioned spaces (as defined in Chapter 2) shall also comply with one of the following paths:

 a. Prescriptive Building Envelope Option Sections 1320 through 1323.

 b. Component Performance Building Envelope Option Sections 1330 through 1334.

 c. Systems Analysis. See Section 1141.4.

EXCEPTION: For semi-heated spaces heated by other fuels only, wall insulation is not required for those walls that separate semi-heated spaces (see definition in Section 201.1) from the exterior provided that the space is heated solely by a heating system controlled by a thermostat with a maximum setpoint capacity of 45 degrees F, mounted no lower than the heating unit.

~~1310.2 Semi-Heated Spaces: All spaces shall be considered conditioned spaces, and shall comply with the requirements in Section 1310.1 unless they meet the following criteria for semi-heated spaces. The installed heating equipment output, in Climate Zone 1, shall be 3 Btu/(h ( ft2) or greater but not greater than 8 Btu/(h ( ft2) and in Climate Zone 2, shall be 5 Btu/(h ( ft2) or greater but not greater than 12 Btu/(h ( ft2). Heating shall be controlled by a thermostat mounted not lower than the heating unit and capable of preventing heating above 44 degrees space temperature. For semi-heated spaces, the only prescriptive, component performance or systems analysis building envelope requirement shall be that:~~Climate Zone 1

~~a. U-0.10 maximum for the roof assembly or~~~~b. continuous R-9 insulation installed entirely outside of the roof structure, or~~~~c. R-11 insulation installed inside or within a wood roof structure, or~~~~d. R-19 insulation installed inside or within a metal roof structure.~~~~Climate Zone 2~~~~a. U=0.07 maximum for the roof assembly, or~~~~b. continuous R-14 insulation installed entirely outside of the roof structure, or~~~~c. R-19 insulation installed inside or within a wood roof structure, or~~~~d. R-25 insulation installed inside or within a metal roof structure.~~

 Section 16. Section 1311.6 of the 2003 Washington State Energy Code is amended as follows:

 1311.6 Radiant Floors (on or below grade): Slab on grade insulation shall extend downward from the top of the slab a minimum distance of 36 inches or downward to the top of the footing and horizontal for an aggregate of not less that 36 inches.

~~If required by the building official where soil conditions warrant such insulation,~~~~t~~The entire area of radiant floor shall be thermally isolated from the soil. Where a soil gas control system is provided below the radiant floor, which results in increased convective flow below the radiant floor, the radiant floor shall be thermally isolated from the sub-floor gravel layer.

 Section 17. Section 1312.2 of the 2003 Washington State Energy Code is amended as follows:

 1312.2 Solar Heat Gain Coefficient and ~~Shading Coefficient~~ Visible Transmittance: Solar Heat Gain Coefficient (SHGC) and Visible Transmittance (VT), shall be determined, certified and labeled in accordance with the National Fenestration Rating Council (NFRC) Standard by a certified, independent agency, licensed by the NFRC.

 EXCEPTIONS: 1. Shading coefficients (SC) or solar heat gain coefficient for the center of glass shall be an acceptable alternate for compliance with solar heat gain coefficient requirements. Shading coefficients or solar heat gain coefficient for the center of glass for glazing shall be taken from Chapter 30 of Standard RS-1 or from the manufacturer's ~~test~~data using a spectral data file determined in accordance with NFRC 300.

2. For the purposes of 1323, Exception 1, visible transmittance for the center of the glazing assembly shall be taken from Chapter 30 of Standard RS-1 or from the manufacturer's data using a spectral data file determined in accordance with NFRC 300.

Note that using the exception for the SHGC for the center-of- glass does not give the full credit for the overall product (including the frame) that the NFRC-certified SHGC does. Though the SHGC for the frame is not zero (the ASHRAE Handbook of Fundamentals indicates that the SHGC can range from 0.11-0.14 for metal frames and from 0.02-0.07 for wood/vinyl/fiberglass frames), the SHGC for the frame is invariable lower than that for the glass. Consequently, an NFRC- certified SHGC will generally be lower.

Conversely, the VT for the center-of-glass overstates the VT for the overall product (including the frame). The VT for the frame is zero. Consequently, an NFRC-certified VT will always be lower. For this reason, Exception 2 to Section 1312.2 is only applicable to Exception 1 in Section 1323. It is not applicable to other sections.

 Section 18 Section 1322 of the 2003 Washington State Energy Code is amended as follows:

 1322 Opaque Envelope: Roof/ceilings, opaque exterior walls, opaque doors, floors over unconditioned space, below grade walls, slab on grade floors and radiant floors enclosing conditioned spaces shall be insulated according to Section 1311 and Tables 13-1or 13-2. Compliance with nominal R-values shall be demonstrated for the thermal resistance of the added insulation in framing cavities and/or insulated sheathing only. Nominal R-values shall not include the thermal transmittance of other building materials or air films.

 For metal frame assemblies used in spaces with electric resistance space heat, compliance shall be demonstrated with the component U- factor for the overall assembly based on the assemblies in Chapter 10.

Area-weighted averaging of the R-value is not allowed. When showing compliance with R-values, the minimum insulation R-value for all areas of the component shall comply with Table 13-1. When calculating compliance using U-factors, area-weighted averaging is allowed. Where insulation is tapered (e.g. roofs), separate assembly U-factors shall be calculated for each four-foot section of tapered insulation.

 EXCEPTIONS:

 1. Opaque smoke vents are not required to meet insulation requirements.

 2. For prescriptive compliance only,

a. for glazing areas that are 30% and less of the gross wall area, the insulation of the perimeter edge of an above grade floor slab which penetrates the exterior wall may be reduced to R-5 provided that the glazing U-factor is reduced by U-0.05 below that required in Tables 13-1 and 13-2.

b. for glazing areas that exceed 30% of the gross wall area, the perimeter edge of an above grade floor slab which penetrates the exterior wall may be left uninsulated provided that the glazing U- factor is reduced by U-0.10 below that required in Tables 13-1 and 13- 2.~~The perimeter edge of an above grade floor slab which penetrates the exterior wall may be left uninsulated provided that the wall insulation is increased by R-2 above that required in Tables 13-1 and 13-2.~~

 (1) design outside airflow is greater than 3,000 cfm, and

 (2) design occupancy averaged over all of the spaces served by the system is greater than 100 people per 1,000 ft2 of floor area.

 The demand ventilation control system shall have CO2 sensors installed in each room where the design occupancy is greater than 40 people per 1,000 ft2 of floor area for single-zone systems and where the design occupancy is greater than 100 people per 1,000 ft2 of floor area for multiple-zone systems. The CO2 sensors shall be located between one foot and six feet above the floor. Ventilation controls shall be in compliance with ASHRAE Standard 62 and the Seattle Mechanical Code.

 Demand ventilation controls shall maintain CO2 concentrations less than or equal to 600 ppm plus the outdoor air CO2 concentration in all rooms with CO2 sensors.

 EXCEPTION: The outdoor air ventilation rate is not required to be larger than the design outdoor air ventilation rate required by the Seattle Mechanical Code regardless of CO2 concentration.

 The outdoor air CO2 concentration shall be assumed to be 400 ppm without any direct measurement or the CO2 concentration shall be dynamically measured using a CO2 sensor located near the position of the outdoor air intake.

 When the system is operating during hours of expected occupancy, the controls shall maintain system outdoor air ventilation rates no less than the rate listed in the Seattle Mechanical Code for spaces with CO2 sensors.

 Section 34. Section 1413.1 of the 2003 Washington State Energy Code is amended as follows:

 1413.1 Operation: Air economizers shall be capable of automatically modulating outside and return air dampers to provide 100% of the design supply air as outside air to reduce or eliminate the need for mechanical cooling. Air economizers shall be used for RS- 29 analysis base case for all systems without exceptions in Sections 1413, 1423, or 1433. Water economizers shall be capable of providing the total concurrent cooling load served by the connected terminal equipment lacking airside economizer, at outside air temperatures of 45(F dry-bulb/40(F wet-bulb and below. For this calculation, all factors including solar and internal load shall be the same as those used for peak load calculations, except for the outside temperatures.

~~EXCEPTION: Water economizers using air-cooled heat rejection equipment may use a 35(F dry-bulb outside air temperature for this calculation. This exception is limited to a maximum of 20 tons per building.~~

 Section 35. Section 1413.3 of the 2003 Washington State Energy Code is amended as follows:

 1413.3 Integrated Operation: The HVAC system and its controls shall allow economizer operation when mechanical cooling is required simultaneously. Air and water economizers shall be capable of providing partial cooling even when additional mechanical cooling is required to meet the remainder of the cooling load.

 EXCEPTIONS:

 1. Individual, direct expansion units that have a rated cooling capacity less than 65,000 Btu/h and use nonintegrated economizer controls that preclude simultaneous operation of the economizer and mechanical cooling.

 2. Water cooled water chillers with waterside economizer.

 Section 36. The 2003 Washington State Energy Code is amended by adding a new Section 1413.5 to read as follows:

 1413.5 Economizer Heating System Impact: Any HVAC system that increases the building heating energy use during economizer operation is not allowed (e.g. single-fan/dual-duct systems and multizone systems).

 EXCEPTIONS:

 1. Where the heating is allowed by Section 1435.

 2. Water source heat pump systems that comply with Section 1433, Exception 2.

 Note that single-fan/dual-duct systems and multizone systems do not comply with this requirement. This is because economizer operation lowers the temperature of the air entering the hot deck heating coil, increasing its energy use. In order to use this type of system, a water economizer must be used, or the system must meet one of the economizer exceptions and have neither type of economizer. (Another resolution is to use a dual-fan/dual-duct system where the hot deck fan supplies only return air or return air plus minimum ventilation air.)

 This requirement will not affect three-deck multizone since they cannot work with an air economizer in any case (it would make the neutral deck a cold deck).

 An exception to the heating impact is provided for economizers on VAV systems that cause zone level heating to increase due to a reduction in supply air temperature. Reducing supply air temperatures on a cooling-VAV system will reduce fan energy (particularly if the system has a variable speed drive), offsetting the energy lost due to increased reheat energy.

 See the discussion and diagrams of Section 6.3.1.4 of ASHRAE/IESNA Standard 90.1 in the Users Manual.

 Section 37. Section 1414.1 of the 2003 Washington State Energy Code is amended as follows:

 1414.1 Sealing: Duct work which is designed to operate at pressures above 1/2 inch water column static pressure shall be sealed ~~in accordance with Standard RS-18. Extent of sealing required is~~as follows:

 1. ~~Static pressure: 1/2 inch to 2 inches; seal transverse joints.~~(Reserved.)

 2. Static pressure: ~~2~~1/2 inches to 3 inches; seal all transverse joints and longitudinal seams. Spiral lock seams in round and flat oval ductwork do not require sealing, however, other seams shall be sealed.

 3. Static pressure: above 3 inches; seal all transverse joints, longitudinal seams and duct wall penetrations.

~~Duct tape and other pressure sensitive tape shall not be used as the primary sealant where ducts are designed to operate at static pressures of 1 inch W.C. or greater.~~

All low-pressure supply and return air systems not located entirely within the conditioned space, including the unconditioned side of enclosed stud bays or joist cavities/spaces used to transport air, shall be securely fastened and sealed. Ductwork shall be sealed using welds, gaskets, mastic, or mastic-plus-embedded-fabric tape. Enclosed stud bays or joist cavities/spaces used to transport air shall be sealed using mastic-plus-embedded-fabric tape or, when drywall is used to enclose the air system, drywall mud and tape. Duct tape is not permitted as a sealant on any ducts.

EXCEPTION: Fibrous glass duct systems installed in accordance with standard UL 181A and flexible duct systems installed in accordance with standard UL 181B may use tapes listed for these systems.

Note that longitudinal seams are joints oriented in the direction of airflow. Transverse joints are connections of two duct sections oriented perpendicular to airflow. Duct wall penetrations are openings made by any screw fastener, pipe, rod or wire.

 a. a combination of dimming ballasts and daylight-sensing automatic controls, which are capable of dimming the lights continuously, or

 b. a combination of stepped switching and daylight-sensing automatic controls, which are capable of incrementally reducing the light level in steps automatically and turning the lights off automatically.

i. Single-lamp luminaire systems shall three levels of automatic control: all lamps on, approximately half of the luminaires turned off in a relatively uniform pattern, and then all of the luminaires off. As an alternate, where the daylight zone contains two rows of luminaires and they are parallel to a window, three levels of automatic control may also be achieved by having both rows on, the row closest to the window off and the other row on, and both rows off. For rooms, such as small offices, which contain only a single one-lamp luminaire, it is acceptable for the daylighting control system to automatically switch off the entire luminaire.

ii. Two-lamp luminaires shall have three levels of automatic control: both lamps on, one lamp on and one lamp off, and both lamps off. As an alternate, where the daylight zone contains two rows of luminaires and they are parallel to a window, three levels of automatic control may also be achieved by having both rows on, the row closest to the window off and the other row on, and both rows off. For rooms, such as small offices, which contain only a single two-lamp luminaire, it is acceptable for the daylighting control system to automatically switch off the entire luminaire rather than switching off one lamp, then both lamps.

iii. Three-lamp luminaires shall have four levels of automatic control: all three lamps on, two lamps on and one lamp off, one lamp on and two lamps off, and all three lamps off.

iv. For other multi-lamp luminaries with four or more lamps, the number of required incremental steps shall be equal to one plus the number of lamps in the luminaire.  Any switching devices installed to override the automatic daylighting control shall comply with the criteria in Section 1513.6.2a-e.

 Numbered Footnotes for Table 3-3

 HVAC System Descriptions for Prototype Buildings

 1. The systems and energy types presented in this Table are not intended as requirements or recommendations for the proposed design.

 2. For occupancies such as restaurants, assembly and retail that are part of a mixed use building which, according to Table 3-3, includes a central chilled water plant (systems 3, 5, or 6), chilled water system type 3 or 5 shall be used as indicated in the table.

 3. Constant volume may be used in zones where pressurization relationships must be maintained by code. Where constant volume is used, the system shall have heat recovery if required by Section 1436. VAV shall be used in all other areas, in accordance with Sections 1432 through 1439.

 4. Provide run-around heat recovery systems for all fan systems with a minimum outside air intake greater than 70%. Recovery effectiveness shall be 0.50.

 5. If a warehouse is not intended to be mechanically cooled, both the standard and proposed designs shall be calculated assuming no mechanical cooling.

 6. The system listed is for guest rooms only. Areas such as public areas and back-of-house areas shall be served by system 4. Other areas such as offices and retail shall be served by systems listed in Table 3-3 for these occupancy types.

 7. The system listed is for guest rooms only. Areas such as public areas and back-of- house areas shall be served by system 5. Other areas such as offices and retail shall be served by systems listed in Table 3-3 for these occupancy types.

 8. Reserved.

 9. Reserved.

 10. Design supply air circulation rate shall be based on a supply-air to room-air temperature difference of 20(F. A higher supply-air temperature may be used if required to maintain a minimum circulation rate of 4.5 air changes per hour or 15 cfm per person to each zone served by the system, at design conditions. If return fans are specified, they shall be sized for the supply fan capacity less the required minimum ventilation with outside air, or 75% of the supply fan capacity, whichever is larger. Except where noted, supply and return fans shall be operated continuously during occupied hours.

 11. Fan energy when included in the efficiency rating of the unit as defined in Section 1411, need not be modeled explicitly for this system. The fan shall cycle with calls for heating or cooling.

 12. Chilled water systems shall be modeled using a reciprocating chiller for systems with total cooling capacities less than 175 tons, and centrifugal chillers for systems with cooling capacities of 175 tons or greater. For systems with cooling capacities of 600 tons or more, the standard design energy consumption shall be calculated using two centrifugal chillers, lead/lag controlled. Chilled water shall be assumed to be controlled at a constant 44(F. Chiller water pumps shall be sized using a 12(F temperature rise, from 44(F to 56(F, operating at 65% combined impeller and motor efficiency. Condenser water pumps shall be sized using a 10(F temperature rise, operating at 60% combined impeller and motor efficiency. The cooling tower shall be an open circuit, centrifugal blower type sized for the larger of 85(F leaving water temperature or 10(F approach to design wetbulb temperature. The tower shall be controlled to provide a 65(F leaving water temperature whenever weather conditions permit, floating up to design leaving water temperatures at design conditions. Chilled water supply temperature shall be reset in accordance with Section 1432.2.2.

 13. Hot water system shall include a natural draft fossil fuel or electric boiler. The hot water pump shall be sized based on a 30(F temperature drop, from 180(F to 150(F, operating at a combined impeller and motor efficiency of 60%. Hot water supply temperature shall be reset in accordance with Section 1432.2.2.

 Section 84. The provisions of this ordinance are declared to be separate and severable. The invalidity of any clause, sentence, paragraph, subdivision, section or portion of this ordinance, or the invalidity of the application thereof to any person, owner, or circumstance shall not affect the validity of the remainder of this ordinance, or the validity of its application to other persons, owners, or circumstances.

 Section 85. The Director of the Department of Planning and Development shall for a period of 60 days following the effective date of this ordinance, approve applications that comply with either the requirements of this Ordinance or with the provisions of Ordinance 120804.

 Section 86. This ordinance shall take effect and be in force thirty (30) days from and after its approval by the Mayor, but if not approved and returned by the Mayor within ten (10) days after presentation, it shall take effect as provided by Municipal Code Section 1.04.020.
