 Exhibit A

 SECOND AMENDMENT TO COOPERATION AGREEMENT

 THIS SECOND AMENDMENT TO COOPERATION AGREEMENT (this "Second Amendment") is made as of ____________________ by and between THE CITY OF SEATTLE (the "City"), a Washington municipal corporation, and the MUSEUM DEVELOPMENT AUTHORITY OF SEATTLE (the "Authority"), a Washington public authority chartered by the City, and amends that certain cooperation agreement effective as of October 1, 1994 (the "Cooperation Agreement"), as amended, with respect to certain rights and responsibilities of the City and the Authority relating to the Authority's Revenue Refunding Bonds, Series 1994.

 I. RECITALS

 These facts and principles form the background of this Second Amendment.

 1. In 1999, the Seattle Art Museum (the "Museum") purchased from Union Oil Company of California certain real property located between Bay and Broad Streets and west of Western Avenue up to and including Lots 1 through 10, Block 168, supplemental plat of Seattle Tidelands in downtown Seattle (the "Unocal Property"), all or a portion of which will be developed as part of SAM's new Olympic Sculpture Park (the "OSP").

 2. The Museum intends to transfer an interest in certain portions of the Unocal Property (the "Unocal Premises") to the Authority pursuant to a ground lease (as amended in writing from time to time, the "Unocal Premises Lease") so that the Authority may perform certain environmental work relating to the Unocal Premises (the "MDA Unocal Premises Work"), which will facilitate the development of the Unocal Premises as part of the OSP.

 3. The Authority intends to lease the Unocal Premises back to the Museum pursuant to a sublease, as authorized by Authority Resolution dated August 21, 2002 (the "Unocal Premises Sublease"). The Unocal Premises Lease and the Unocal Premises Sublease provide that the Authority will perform the MDA Unocal Premises Work, and that the Museum will provide certain oversight, management and supervisory services to the Authority in connection therewith. The Unocal Premises Sublease also provides that the Museum will make certain lump sum payments to the Authority as rent (the "Unocal Premises Sublease Rent"), which are intended to be at least sufficient, with the Grant Funds described below, to pay for the MDA Unocal Premises Work. The Unocal Premises Lease provides that the Authority will apply for funds, in addition to the Unocal Premises Sublease Rent, to help pay for the MDA Unocal Premises Work, including without limitation grants and donations from individuals, entities, regulatory agencies and other funders (the "Unocal Premises Grant Funds"). The Unocal Premises Sublease Rent and the Unocal Premises Grant Funds shall hereinafter be referred to collectively as the "Unocal Premises Revenues."

 4. The Authority and the City recognize that Unocal Premises Revenues may constitute "Revenues" as defined in the Authority's Bond Resolution and the Cooperation Agreement. As such, the Authority and the City recognize that the Unocal Premises Sublease Rent and the Unocal Premises Grant Funds must be deposited in the General Fund of the Authority, which was created pursuant to Section 9 of the Authority's Bond Resolution and Section 4.3 of the Cooperation Agreement. The Authority and the City further recognize that, so long as the Authority's 1994 Bonds are outstanding, money in the Authority's General Fund must be used only for the purposes and in the order of priority set forth in Section 9 of the Bond Resolution and Section 4.3 of the Cooperation Agreement.

 5. Section 4.3 of the Cooperation Agreement and the First Amendment to the Cooperation Agreement currently limits the use of Revenues to pay operational expenses of the Authority to an annual amount, as determined by the Authority and the Museum, not to exceed $100,000, plus any amount necessary to pay 10 Broad Street Expenses and OSP Expenses (provided, however, that the aggregate used to pay 10 Broad Street Expenses and OSP Expenses shall not exceed the aggregate of the 10 Broad Street Revenues).

 6. The Authority expects that its expenses related to the Unocal Premises will exceed $100,000 annually for certain years during the term of the Cooperation Agreement. The Authority's expenses related to the Unocal Premises will include the cost of the MDA Unocal Premises Work and the cost of administering the Unocal Premises Sublease and the Unocal Premises Lease (the "Unocal Premises Expenses") as well as rent due by the Authority pursuant to the Unocal Premises Lease (the "Unocal Premises Lease Rent").

 7. The acquisition of a ground lease estate and development of the Unocal Premises for the OSP constitute a public purpose for which public funds may properly be expended or advanced.

 8. The Authority and the City wish to amend the Cooperation Agreement to provide for payment of the Unocal Premises Expenses and the Unocal Premises Lease Rent.
