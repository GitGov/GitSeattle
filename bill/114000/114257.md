 ORDINANCE __________________

 AN ORDINANCE establishing a separation incentive program for eligible non-represented City employees.

 WHEREAS, the City projects significant reductions in its 2003 budget; and

 WHEREAS, such reductions will result in the abrogation of funded positions and implementation of orders of layoff; and

 WHEREAS, the City desires to mitigate the impact of layoffs on the City's workforce; NOW, THEREFORE,

 BE IT ORDAINED BY THE CITY OF SEATTLE AS FOLLOWS:

 Section 1. The Mayor and the City Council authorize the heads of employing units to implement a separation incentive program as herein described for regularly appointed non-represented employees of the City of Seattle, exclusive of elected officials, members appointed to Boards and Commissions, department heads, employees of the Seattle Public Library, and persons employed by the City of Seattle on a temporary, intermittent or contractual basis.

 Section 2. A separation incentive program shall be established as follows:

 A. Eligibility. Participation in the early separation program is voluntary. An employee is eligible to participate in the program if, in the judgment of his or her department head, his or her termination from City employment supports a business need of his or her employing unit, would mitigate the need for a layoff within the employing unit, and/or would provide an opportunity for the employing unit to appoint another employee who is at risk of layoff to the resulting vacancy; and he or she agrees to terminate his or her employment with the City on or before September 30, 2002.

 B. Benefits. The separation incentive payment shall be the equivalent of eight weeks of pay, determined by multiplying the employee's regular straight-time weekly wage by eight. The regular straight-time weekly wage is the hourly rate of pay the employee receives for the position to which he or she has a regular appointment, effective the date of his or her termination, times the number of non-overtime hours the employee is authorized to work on a weekly basis, not to exceed 40 hours per week. For part-time employees who work a fluctuating schedule, the regular straight-time weekly wage shall be calculated using an average of hours worked during the 26 pay periods preceding his or her application date.

 An employee accepted for inclusion in the separation incentive program may select any of the following options, or any combination of these options, for distribution of the separation payment, less any mandatory deductions and subject to any legal limitations:

 1. A lump sum payment.

 2. Payment of the employee's and the employer's costs to purchase up to four additional years of service credit in the City Employees' Retirement System. The separation incentive payment may be combined with any payment the employee receives for the cash-out of vacation, compensatory time, and/or sick leave as applicable and/or additional personal resources to the extent permitted by law for purposes of purchasing such service credit. An employee who has been demoted or reduced to a lower-paying position within one month of his or her application for inclusion in the separation incentive program or is demoted or reduced at any time subsequent to his or her application through the date of actual termination from City employment may not elect this option.

 3. Deferral to the employee's existing Section 457 Deferred Compensation account. The combination of the employee's year-to-date deferrals plus the amount deferred from the early separation payment may not exceed the Internal Revenue Code maximum deferral amount.

 4. Payment of currently-enrolled health care benefits at the City's COBRA rate, subject to any rate changes, for a maximum of 18 months.

 C. Any employee who accepts the separation incentive payment is prohibited from re-employment with the City of Seattle for a period of two years following his or her termination date. This prohibition covers full-time, part-time, civil service exempt and non-exempt and temporary positions, as well as consulting and contract work.

 D. Any employee who accepts the separation incentive payment will be required, as a condition of such payment, to release all claims he or she may have against the City and/or its officers, employees and agents.

 E. Application and Approval

 1. An employee who wishes to participate in the separation incentive program shall make application to the head of his or her department on the form provided for that purpose between July 12, 2002 and July 24, 2002, inclusive.

 2. The head of the employing unit in which the separation incentive program applicant is employed shall make the determination whether to accept the application, and shall provide each applicant an irrevocable notification of his or her determination no later than August 5, 2002.

 3. Each employee who receives notification of acceptance for receipt of the separation incentive payment shall have until September 19, 2002 to consider whether to participate in the separation incentive program. Failure of the employee to complete and submit the required Agreement and Release Form and Options Distribution Form to the human resources manager of his or her employing unit by September 19, 2002 shall constitute his or her withdrawal from the separation incentive program.

 4. Each employee who submits the required Agreement and Release Form and Options Distribution Form shall have until close of business on the seventh day following such submission but no later than September 26, 2002 to withdraw from participation in the program. Thereafter the employee's participation is irrevocable.

 Section 3. Any acts made consistent with the authority and prior to the effective date of this ordinance are hereby ratified and confirmed.

 Section 4. This ordinance shall take effect and be in force thirty (30) days from and after its approval by the Mayor, but if not approved and returned by the Mayor within ten (10) days after presentation, it shall take effect as provided by Municipal Code Section 1.04.020.
