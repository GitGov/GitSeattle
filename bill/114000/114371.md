 AN ORDINANCE relating to the fees for the vacation of streets and other public rights-of-way, amending Subsection A of Seattle Municipal Code Section 15.62.090 to exempt City departments from paying the fee.

 WHEREAS, the City derives its authority to charge a fee for street vacations from the State of Washington; and

 WHEREAS, the State Legislature, in the 2001 Legislative Session, amended RCW chapter 35.79 to grant cities the authority to charge a fee for the compensation for street vacations that is equal to the full appraised value of the right-of-way for all streets that have been part of a dedicated public right-of-way for twenty-five years or more; and

 WHEREAS, the City last amended Seattle Municipal Code Section 15.62.090 in November 2001 through Ordinance 120607 to charge the maximum amount allowed by State Law from all petitioners, other than State or Federal agencies.

 WHEREAS, the City now wishes to extend the exemption granted to State and Federal agencies to City departments to reduce administrative and accounting costs, NOW, THEREFORE,

 Section 1. Subsection A of Seattle Municipal Code Section 15.62.090 is hereby amended as follows:

 15.62.090 Compensation for vacation

 A. Ordinances vacating any street or alley or part thereof shall not be passed by the City Council until a sum equal to one-half (1/2) of the appraised value of the area vacated is paid to the City, provided that if the street or alley has been a part of a dedicated public right-of-way for twenty-five years or more, the City shall be compensated in an amount equal to the full appraised value of the area vacated. In certain circumstances, provision of other valuable consideration acceptable to the City may be made in lieu of up to one-half (1/2) of the payment; provided that such consideration shall not be acceptable if it is required for the street vacation, it is considered a public benefit to meet the public benefit requirements of the street vacation, or it is required by other regulatory action. Acceptable consideration shall be quantified in dollars which shall then be credited to the required payment. City, State and federal agencies shall be exempt from such payment, but shall pay to the City all costs incurred by the City in processing the vacation request. As contemplated by RCW 35.79.035(3), the full market value shall be paid upon vacation of streets abutting upon bodies of water.

 Section 2. Any act pursuant to and prior to the effective date of this ordinance is hereby ratified and confirmed.
