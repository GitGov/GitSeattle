 Exhibit A: Line of Credit November 26, 2002 version 10 ta LINE OF CREDIT

 $20,000,000 (U.S.) Seattle Popular Monorail Authority Line of Credit

 THIS AGREEMENT for a Line of Credit is entered into this ___ day of __________, 2003, by and between THE CITY OF SEATTLE, Washington , ("City"), a first-class charter city, and the SEATTLE POPULAR MONORAIL AUTHORITY ("SPMA"), an independent municipal corporation and city transportation authority created by voters pursuant to Chapter 35.95A R.C.W.

 SECTION 1. Line of Credit

 A. The City agrees to extend to SPMA a Line of Credit of Twenty Million Dollars ($20,000,000) which may be drawn on only until December 31, 2004, and may be used by SPMA only to pay expenses that may be capitalized under generally accepted accounting principles. The aggregate principal amount of all Loan Draws shall not exceed Twenty Million Dollars ($20,000,000). SPMA may make Loan Draws on the Line of Credit in any integral multiple of One Hundred Thousand Dollars ($100,000) for the purposes set forth in Ordinance _______ (C.B. 114419) and Resolution 30486 (the "Line of Credit Legislation") upon three (3) business days' notice to the City.

 B. The City shall honor only written draw requests signed in hard copy by two authorized representatives of the SPMA. The SPMA Board shall designate authorized representatives through a formal Board action and shall provide a copy of such action to the City. The SPMA Board may change authorized representatives through formal Board action and notification to the City. Draw requests shall state the exact amount and date of the requested draw. All draws except draws for the purpose of making SPMA Compensating Payments as described in Section 2C below shall be made on or before the requested draw date by wire transfer to Account # ___________ at _______ Bank, routing/transit number ____________, unless notice is properly given to the City, no later than when the draw request is made, of some other account into which the funds are to be deposited.

 C. SPMA shall repay principal and shall pay other amounts on the Line of Credit as set forth herein. Loan Draws, other amounts due, payments and prepayments, if any, shall be recorded in monthly statements prepared by the City, or in such other form as SPMA and the City may agree, and sent to SPMA, but the failure of the City to accurately record or transmit a statement of the draws, payments and prepayments if any, shall not affect the SPMA's obligations to make payments as required by this Agreement.

 SECTION 2. Compensating Payments.

 A. To provide this Twenty Million Dollar ($20,000,000) Line of Credit, the City has issued Twenty Million Dollars ($20,000,000) in limited tax general obligation bonds as part of a larger bond issuance known as "$64,560,000 Limited Tax General Obligation Improvement and Refunding Bonds, 2002B Dated: September 1, 2002" ("LTGO Bonds"). The Twenty Million Dollar ($20,000,000) principal portion of the LTGO Bonds issued for the Line of Credit ("LC Bonds") for SPMA must be repaid to bondholders on October 1, 2005 and the City is obliged to pay bondholders interest twice a year at an annual rate of 3.00%. Interest on the LC Bonds is computed on the basis of a 360-day year consisting of twelve 30-day months. When the City sold the LC Bonds, it received from bondholders a premium of $582,000 as part of the purchase price attributable to the LC Bonds. (Because of that premium, the effective annual yield on the LC Bonds is 2.00%.) In selling the LC Bonds, the City incurred costs of $30,307.62. The parties intend the effect of this Agreement to be that SPMA compensates the City fully for its issuance costs and that SPMA bear the full cost of the 3% annual interest the City must pay its bondholders, net of the premium the City received and of the City's actual investment earnings on whatever portion of the $20,000,000 is, from time to time, in the City treasury. Furthermore, the parties intend that if the City's investment earnings plus the premium exceed, over the term of the Line of Credit, the total interest the City pays on the LC Bonds plus the costs of issuing the LC Bonds, those extra earnings be retained by the City. The parties also intend that under certain circumstances SPMA pay additional amounts to the City as specified in this Agreement.

 B. The City shall use the premium it received and any investment earnings thereon to (1) reimburse itself for the costs of issuing the LC Bonds and then (2) apply toward the interest payments due to bondholders of the LC Bonds during 2003. SPMA shall be responsible to provide the City with sufficient money for the City to use to pay the remainder of the interest due to LC bondholders in October 2003.

 SPMA will also provide the City with sufficient money to pay the April 1 and October 1 interest payments due bondholders of the LC Bonds during 2004 and 2005 as stated herein. The April 1 and October 1, 2004, and April 1 and October 1, 2005, interest payments due from the City to bondholders are each $300,000. SPMA shall pay those amounts to the City, reduced as provided in the next sentence. The City shall credit against the payments owed by SPMA as provided in the prior sentence any investment earnings the City has realized, as of a date the City's Director of Finance selects reasonably close to the interest payment date, on the undrawn portion and the repaid portion of the Line of Credit. Such credit shall be net of earnings previously used as a credit. The City's Director of Finance's good faith determination of the investment earnings on the LC Bonds shall be final. Not less than ten (10) business days prior to the interest due date for the LC Bonds, the City shall provide SPMA with written notice of the amount and due date of the payment due from SPMA ("SPMA Compensating Payment"). The City will also provide this notice, not less than ten (10) business days prior to the interest due date for the LC Bonds, by either facsimile or e-mail. However, any failure by the City to provide notice of the amounts and due dates of SPMA Compensating Payments shall not excuse performance by the SPMA of its obligation to pay the SPMA Compensating Payments when due.

 C. SPMA shall pay the City the SPMA Compensating Payment at least five (5) business days prior to the corresponding interest payment due date on the LC Bonds. SPMA shall have the option of authorizing, at least eight (8) business days prior to the corresponding interest payment due date on the LC Bonds, the City to draw for the City's use an amount equal to the SPMA Compensating Payment from the Line of Credit, if there is sufficient credit available to cover such a draw. In the event SPMA does not make a timely payment to the City of the SPMA Compensating Payment, either by direct payment or by timely authorizing a City draw, the City shall have the right, but not the obligation, to draw for the City's use and without prior notice to SPMA an amount sufficient to pay the SPMA Compensating Payment from the Line of Credit. Any draw made upon the Line of Credit to cover an SPMA Compensating Payment shall be deemed a Loan Draw of SPMA.

 D. Within ten (10) business days after October 1, 2005, the City's Director of Finance shall compute the sum of the City's costs of issuance of the LC Bonds plus the 3% annual interest the City paid the holders of the LC Bonds plus any amounts then remaining due from the SPMA to the City under Sections 5, 6, and 7 of this Agreement. The Director of Finance shall compare that sum to the sum of the premium the City received from the purchaser of the LC Bonds plus the total investment earnings of the City on the portion of the $20,000,000 that was, from time to time, in the City treasury. If the first-mentioned sum reduced by the SPMA Compensating Payments received by the City exceeds the second-mentioned sum, the Director of Finance shall invoice the SPMA for the difference, which the SPMA will pay to the City within ten (10) business days after receipt of notice. If the second-mentioned sum exceeds the first-mentioned sum, the City shall retain all amounts it has received, and the SPMA shall still owe the City all amounts then remaining due to the City under Sections 5, 6, and 7 of this Agreement.

 E. If by October 1, 2005, the SPMA has made no draws whatsoever on the Line of Credit other than to make SPMA Compensating Payments, then the City shall refund to SPMA all amounts paid by SPMA under this Agreement.

 SECTION 3. Payment of Outstanding Unpaid Loan Draws

 On or before the date two (2) years after the date of SPMA's first loan draw, but in no event later than January 5, 2005, SPMA shall pay to the City an amount equal to the total outstanding unrepaid Loan Draws.

 Payments shall be applied: (a) first, to the payment of any SPMA Compensating Payment due pursuant to Section 2; (b) second, at the option of the City, to the payment of any other amounts then owing under this Line of Credit other than SPMA Compensating Payments and principal, including late charges and interest charges due hereunder and advances the City may have made for attorneys' fees; and (c) third, to the reduction of outstanding unrepaid Loan Draws of this Line of Credit.

 SPMA obligations to repay the City under this agreement are secured by a lien on revenues of SPMA, which lien is junior to the payment of any notes and bonds issued by SPMA.

 SECTION 4. Prepayment.

 SPMA may at any time prepay its outstanding unrepaid Loan Draws under this Line of Credit in full or in part. Such prepayment shall not excuse SPMA's obligation to pay SPMA Compensating Payments as set forth in Section 2 above. SPMA does not have the right to prepay any SPMA Compensating Payments owed pursuant to Section 2.

 SECTION 5. Late Charge.

 If any amount payable hereunder is paid after the due date thereof, SPMA promises to pay a late charge of five percent (5.00%) of the delinquent amount as liquidated damages for the extra expense in handling past due payments. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, this late charge shall be applicable even if the City elects (without having been timely so directed by the SPMA) to make a draw upon the Line of Credit to cover an SPMA Compensating Payment.

 SECTION 6. Default; Remedies.

 SPMA shall be in default of this Line of Credit if it fails to pay within four (4) business days of the date when any amount payable hereunder is due. In the event of a default, at the option of the City, the entire outstanding unrepaid Loan Draws shall become immediately due and payable. Additionally, in the event of a default, and without notice, the City shall have the right to refuse to honor any subsequent Loan Draw requests until such default is cured. Failure to exercise any option granted to the City hereunder shall not waive the right to exercise the same in the event of any subsequent default. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event that SPMA is in default of any of its payment obligations on September 1, 2005, the SPMA shall, beginning on that date and monthly thereafter, pay the City interest on the amounts due at a rate of 12.00% per annum.

 SECTION 7. Attorneys' Fees.

 In the event of any default under this Line of Credit, or in the event that any dispute arises relating to the interpretation, enforcement, or performance of this Line of Credit, the City shall be entitled to collect from SPMA on demand all fees and expenses incurred in connection therewith, including but not limited to fees of attorneys, accountants, appraisers, environmental inspectors, consultants, expert witnesses, arbitrators, mediators, and court reporters. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, SPMA shall pay all such costs and expenses incurred in connection with: (a) arbitration or other alternative dispute resolution proceedings, trial court actions, and appeals; (b) bankruptcy or other insolvency proceedings of SPMA; (c) postjudgment collection proceedings; (d) all claims, counterclaims, cross-claims, and defenses asserted in any of the foregoing whether or not they arise out of or are related to this Line of Credit; (e) all preparation for any of the foregoing; and (f) all settlement negotiations with respect to any of the foregoing.

 SECTION 8. Equal Opportunity

 In its employment and contracting practices, the SPMA shall assure equal opportunity to all persons, free from restrictions because of race, color, sex, marital status, sexual orientation, gender identity, political ideology, age, creed, religion, ancestry, national origin, or the presence of any sensory, mental or physical disability. The City encourages the SPMA to employ a workforce reflective of the region's diversity. The City also encourages the SPMA to set aspirational goals for the use of women- and minority-owned businesses in contracted work. The SPMA shall comply, and shall require all contractors and subcontractors to comply, with all applicable equal employment opportunity and nondiscrimination laws of the United States, the State of Washington, and The City of Seattle.

 SECTION 9. Indemnification

 SPMA shall indemnify, defend, and hold the City, its elected officials, officers, employees and agents harmless from any and all claims, actions, suits, proceedings, damages, costs, and expenses (including reasonable fees of attorneys and paralegal assistants) whatsoever arising out of any act or omission of SPMA or any of its officers, employees, agents, licensees, or invitees under this Line of Credit including patent, trademark and copyright infringement; or arising out of or relating to any concurrent act or omission of SPMA or any of its officers, employees, contractors or agents and the City or any City officer, elected official, employee or agent; Provided, that nothing herein shall be construed as requiring SPMA to indemnify the City against liability for bodily injury or damage to property caused by or resulting from the sole negligence of the City or of any of its officers, elected officials, employees, or agents. SPMA waives any immunity under industrial insurance, Title 51 RCW, it may have to claims brought against it by the City in connection with this Line of Credit. The indemnification obligation set forth in this section shall survive the expiration or earlier termination of this Line of Credit.

 SECTION 10. Addresses

 Notices. All notices, payments, demands and other communications under this Line of Credit shall be in writing and shall either be delivered in person or sent by Federal Express or by first class mail through the U.S. Postal Service with postage prepaid as follows; provided that any payments (other than Draws, which shall be made only as provided in Section 1) may be made by wire transfer to the accounts listed below and the monthly statements prepared by the City may be faxed or emailed to SPMA.

Notices shall be deemed to have been given upon the earlier of actual receipt, as evidenced by the deliverer's affidavit, the recipient's acknowledgment of receipt, or the Federal Express receipt, or, in the case of postal mailing, three business days after mailing. In the event of attempted delivery during normal business hours at the proper address by an agent of a party or by Federal Express or the U.S. Postal Service but refused acceptance, notice shall be deemed to have been given upon attempted delivery, as evidenced by an affidavit of inability to deliver stating the time, date, place and manner in which such delivery was attempted and the manner in which such delivery was refused.

 SECTION 11. Miscellaneous.

 (a) Every person or entity at any time liable for the payment of the indebtedness evidenced hereby waives presentment for payment, demand, and notice of nonpayment of this Line of Credit.
