 AN ORDINANCE relating to the Thornton Creek Water Quality Channel Project of Seattle Public Utilities; increasing the 2004 allocation for that project in the 2004-2009 Capital Improvement Program for the Drainage and Wastewater Fund; and increasing the 2004 appropriation to Seattle Public Utilities with respect to that project.

 WHEREAS, the Thornton Creek Water Quality Channel Project (Project) is defined as building a surface swale on the Northgate South Lot to provide year-round surface flow and water quality treatment from 670 acres in the Thornton Creek Watershed for frequent storm flows diverted from the public drainage control system located at NE 100th Street and 3rd Avenue NE; and

 WHEREAS, the City of Seattle has an option to purchase the Eastern 2.7 acres of the Northgate South Lot and the ordinance that was introduced as C.B. 114939 provides approval for the purchase of this lot; and

 WHEREAS, the City of Seattle is required under the Northgate Mall Development Agreement to return the lot to Simon if after five years from the effective date of the agreement, no open space, natural drainage or stormwater improvements have occurred; and

 WHEREAS, City Council Resolution 30642 requested that Seattle Public Utilities evaluate and recommend one of three specified options for natural drainage and open space options for the Northgate South Lot; and

 WHEREAS, the three options outlined in City Council Resolution 30642 and further developed for evaluation include: 1) daylighting flows in the conveyance pipe under the Northgate South Lot, 2) constructing a series of natural system swales to treat drainage from the adjacent neighborhood, and 3) constructing a hybrid (Hybrid) of the two other options considered, which involves diverting dry weather flows and flows from frequent storm events from the conveyance pipe at NE 100th Street and 3rd Avenue NE to a surface channel for water quality treatment; and

 WHEREAS, the primary purpose of this project is to provide water quality treatment due to the Department of Ecology listing of Thornton Creek as an "impaired water" of the state and selecting Thornton Creek for a non-point pollution clean up plan targeted for 2005; and

 WHEREAS, drainage rate customers from the City of Seattle ranked "improvement in water quality in lakes and streams" as the most important drainage investment; and

 WHEREAS, the technical analysis conducted by Seattle Public Utilities and the Northgate South Lot technical team suggests that the Hybrid option provides the most pollutant removal and the least cost per unit of pollutants removed of the three options considered; and

 WHEREAS, the Northgate Stakeholder Group established by Council Resolution 30642 has unanimously indicated a preference for the Hybrid option in a vote on June 3, 2004, encouraged the City Council and Mayor to take their fiduciary responsibility seriously, and cited water quality performance and year-round flow as valued benefits; and

 WHEREAS, the community attendees at the May 13, 2004 Public Forum held by the Northgate Stakeholder Group indicated strong support for a drainage and open space project on the Northgate South Lot and indicated a preference for the Hybrid option; and

 WHEREAS, this Project is consistent with the 2004 Proposed Comprehensive Drainage Plan policies for the Protection of Beneficial Use Program, which include "proactively retrofit drainage infrastructure, when physically feasible and cost effective, to improve water quality in problem areas," and "mitigate the direct effects of stormwater impacts on creeks and other aquatic environments through projects and programs that improve water quality and conditions for aquatic biota"; and

 WHEREAS, on May 19th, 2004, the Asset Management Committee of Seattle Public Utilities approved the Thornton Creek Water Quality Channel Project and associated funding request for the Hybrid option; NOW, THEREFORE,

 BE IT ORDAINED BY THE CITY OF SEATTLE AS FOLLOWS:
