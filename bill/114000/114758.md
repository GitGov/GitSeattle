 ORDINANCE _________________

 AN ORDINANCE relating to wastewater services of Seattle Public Utilities; amending Seattle Municipal Code Chapter 21.28 to adjust wastewater rates; and amending Seattle Municipal Code Section 21.76.040 to adjust credits to low-income wastewater customers.

 WHEREAS, the rates for wastewater services were last increased on January 1, 2003; and

 WHEREAS, about two-thirds of the total cost of providing wastewater service is the cost of King County sewage treatment services, which treatment cost is determined solely by King County and is expected to increase for 2004; and

 WHEREAS, the installation of additional wastewater facilities has resulted in increased annual wastewater expenses for debt service and operations; and

 WHEREAS, Seattle Public Utilities ("SPU") anticipates, and the Council recognizes, that a significant bond issuance will be needed during 2004 to finance a portion of the wastewater Capital Improvement Program ("CIP") and that this issuance will further increase annual wastewater expenses for debt service; and

 WHEREAS, a reexamination of costs shared by the wastewater, drainage, water, and solid waste components of SPU has resulted in an increase in costs allocated to wastewater ratepayers; and

 WHEREAS, SPU has completed a rate study showing that existing rates will not provide sufficient revenues to pay the costs of providing wastewater services and that rate increases therefore are required; and

 WHEREAS, the City Council has reviewed SPU's study and proposed rate increases, and the City Council has determined that somewhat lower rate increases are needed to produce revenues that, barring unforeseen factors that significantly increase costs or decrease revenues (e.g., Superfund cleanup costs and National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System permit costs), will enable (a) the SPU wastewater line of business to cash-finance at least 11.5% of its 2004 CIP, 14% of its 2005 CIP and 24% of its 2006 CIP, while also achieving year-end cash balances of a $4 million, $5.5 million and $6.2 million in 2004, 2005 and 2006, respectively and (b) the overall SPU Drainage and Wastewater Fund to cash-finance at least 11.5% of its 2004 CIP, 14% of its 2005 CIP and 17.6% of its 2006 CIP, while achieving year-end cash balances of $7 million, $6 million and $6.7 million in 2004, 2005 and 2006, respectively; and

 WHEREAS, credits for qualified low-income customers not billed directly by SPU are based on typical residential bills, and credits for such customers need to be revised to reflect changes in wastewater rates; and

 WHEREAS, automatic adjustments of wastewater rates and credits for qualified low-income customers to reflect changes in King County treatment costs will enable SPU to focus management attention on the costs of those wastewater services under the City's direct control; and

 WHEREAS, it is desirable to limit fluctuations in wastewater rates by adopting rates for a three year period for the portion of wastewater costs under the City's direct control; NOW, THEREFORE,

 BE IT ORDAINED BY THE CITY OF SEATTLE AS FOLLOWS:

 Section 1. Effective January 1, 2004, Seattle Municipal Code Subsection 21.28.005.Q is amended as follows:
