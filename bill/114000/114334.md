 AN ORDINANCE relating to low-income housing, authorizing the Director of the Office of Housing to sell loans from the Homebuyer Assistance Loan portfolio to HomeSight, a Washington nonprofit corporation, and ratifying and confirming prior acts.

 WHEREAS, The City of Seattle currently owns certain down payment assistance loans made to low-income homebuyers in the city ("Homebuyer Assistance Loans"); and

 WHEREAS, the City Council adopted the 2001-2004 Consolidated Plan allowing for HomeSight to use Homebuyer Assistance Loan receipts for new Homebuyer Assistance Loans and the City has entered into a Homebuyer Master Loan Agreement with HomeSight dated December 18, 2001 for that and other purposes; and

 WHEREAS, HomeSight currently administers a Homebuyer Down Payment Assistance Loan program in accordance with the Homebuyer Master Loan Agreement, and has the ability to service Homebuyer Assistance Loans; and

 WHEREAS, the Office of Housing and HomeSight desire to enter into an agreement for the sale of Homebuyer Assistance Loans from the City to HomeSight; and

 WHEREAS, HomeSight can leverage non-City funds to augment its Homebuyer Down Payment Assistance Loan program if certified as a Community Development Financial Institution Financing Entity (if homebuyer loans constitute more than half of HomeSight's business activities) or by selling the Homebuyer Assistance Loan portfolio on the secondary mortgage market;

 NOW, THEREFORE,

 BE IT ORDAINED BY THE CITY OF SEATTLE AS FOLLOWS:

 Section 1. The Director of the Office of Housing ("Housing Director") or her designee is authorized, for and on behalf of The City of Seattle, to sell all or any portion of the Homebuyer Assistance Loan portfolio described in Section 2 of this ordinance to HomeSight, on the terms and subject to the conditions of an agreement as described in Section 3 below.

 Section 2. The number and original aggregate principal amounts of the Homebuyer Assistance Loans authorized to be sold are:

 (a) Forty-four (44) loans with a total original principal amount of One Million Seventy-six Thousand Four Hundred Sixty-seven Dollars ($1,076,467) and funded by federal HOME funds;

 (b) Sixteen (16) loans with a total original principal amount of Three Hundred Twenty-nine Thousand Three Hundred Ninety-four Dollars ($329,394) and funded by federal Community Development Block Grant (CDBG) funds, or by CDBG program income or other revenues required to be treated as such;

 (c) Ten (10) loans with a total original principal amount of Three Hundred Nine Thousand Four Hundred Ninety-seven Dollars ($309,497) and funded by City general funds; and

 (d) One (1) loan with a total original principal amount of Twenty- five Thousand Dollars ($25,000) and funded by federal Community Development Block Grant (CDBG) funds in the amount of Fifteen Thousand Dollars ($15,000), and by City general funds in the amount of Ten Thousand Dollars ($10,000).

 Section 3. The Housing Director is authorized, for and on behalf of the City, to enter into, administer and perform a written agreement with Homesight for the sale of Homebuyer Assistance Loans, in form and substance acceptable to the Housing Director, which shall include the following terms:

 (a) The sales price shall be the aggregate total of the outstanding principal and accrued interest of the Homebuyer Assistance Loans being sold, determined as of a date set by the Housing Director within fifteen (15) days prior to the sale ("Cutoff Date"), with any adjustments for payments received by the City after the Cutoff Date that the Housing Director determines to be appropriate.

 (b) HomeSight shall execute and deliver to the City at closing of the sale a Promissory Note, dated as of the Cutoff Date, in the amount of the sales price ("Loan Purchase Note"). The Loan Purchase Note shall bear interest at a rate to be determined by the City at time of sale, based upon a blended rate of Homebuyer Assistance Loans being sold, and shall mature in twenty (20) years. If HomeSight desires to extend the 20-year maturity date for up to an additional ten (10) years, then Homesight may request extension six (6) months in advance of the maturity date, and if the Housing Director determines that HomeSight is in compliance with the terms of the Homebuyer Master Loan Agreement as amended pursuant to Section 4 of this ordinance, such extension shall be granted by the Housing Director.

 (c) The Loan Purchase Note shall be secured by the following, each in form and content acceptable to the Housing Director:

 (i) a security agreement;

 (ii) assignments for security purposes only, of each promissory note being sold, perfected in such manner as the City shall require and subject to no prior liens or encumbrances on HomeSight's interest, provided that so long as HomeSight is not in default under the Homebuyer Master Loan Agreement, HomeSight may collect payments on the transferred Homebuyer Assistance Loans, and may proceed with foreclosure or such other remedy as HomeSight in its sole discretion deems appropriate in the event of a default by the homebuyer on an individual note sold by the City to Homesight ("Homebuyer Note"), and the Homebuyer Note shall be returned to HomeSight by the City when required for such purposes;

 (iii) assignments for security purposes of deeds of trust securing all Homebuyer Assistance Loans, and subject to no prior liens or encumbrances on HomeSight's interest as beneficiary; and

 (iv) assignments for security purposes of all bank accounts, moneys, investments, and receivables derived from the Homebuyer Assistance Loans sold under authority of this ordinance or from any funds provided to HomeSight by the City under the Homebuyer Master Loan Agreement, perfected in such manner as the City shall require and subject to no prior liens or encumbrances.

 (d) Homesight shall use any revenues from Homebuyer Assistance Loans, including all money derived directly from these loans, only in accordance with an Amended and Restated Master Loan Agreement as contemplated by Section 4 of this Ordinance, or for payment of amounts owing to the City on the Loan Purchase Note. Unless the City and Homesight shall have signed an Amended and Restated Master Loan Agreement as authorized in Section 4 of this ordinance, Homesight shall not make any use of any such revenues except for any payments to the City.

 (e) HomeSight shall provide to the City, in addition to such annual or other reporting as the Housing Director shall require, a comprehensive report on its activities under the Amended and Restated Master Loan Agreement contemplated by this Ordinance one year after signing such agreement, and every five years thereafter.

 Section 4. The Housing Director shall prepare an Amended and Restated Master Loan Agreement with HomeSight ("Amended Agreement") to amend and supersede the Homebuyer Master Loan Agreement dated December 18, 2001. The Amended Agreement shall incorporate substantially the terms set forth in Exhibit 1 to this ordinance and shall make any changes needed to the existing Master Loan Agreement to bring the agreement into conformance with the terms as outlined in Exhibit 1. The Housing Director is authorized, for and on behalf of the City, to execute, deliver, perform and administer such an Amended Agreement. Any future changes to the Amended Agreement that would be materially inconsistent with, or result in substantial changes to, any of the terms contained in Exhibit 1 shall require prior City Council approval. Modifications to the dollar amount to be lent to HomeSight, if consistent with budget authority and with allocations in the City's Consolidated Plan where applicable, shall not require such approval.

 Section 5. The Housing Director shall submit a report regarding HomeSight's performance under the Amended Agreement to the City Council's Housing, Human Services & Community Development Committee, or such successor committee as may be responsible for housing, one year after signing of the Amended Agreement and every 5 years thereafter.

 Section 6. The Housing Director is further authorized to execute and deliver such documents, consistent with the terms of this ordinance, as she deems necessary or appropriate to accomplish the sales of Homebuyer Assistance Loans authorized by this ordinance.

 Section 7. Any actions pursuant to the authority granted by this ordinance and prior to the effective date hereof are hereby ratified and confirmed.

 Section 8. This ordinance shall take effect and be in force thirty (30) days from and after its approval by the Mayor, but if not approved and returned by the Mayor within ten (10) days after presentation, it shall take effect as provided by Municipal Code Section 1.04.020.

 Exhibit 1: Term Sheet for Amended and Restated Master Loan Agreement

 09-27-02 version #6 t Exhibit 1 to Ordinance: Term Sheet for Amended and Restated Master Loan Agreement

 Basic Terms of the Homebuyer Master Loan Agreement ("MLA," originally executed December 18, 2001) as it is to be amended ("Amended Agreement"):

 * The Amended Agreement shall incorporate the obligations of HomeSight under the Loan Purchase Note, as well as the existing Master Promissory Note, where appropriate and in a manner consistent with the terms of Section 3 of this ordinance.

 * Generally, the Amended Agreement shall treat a loan sold to HomeSight under authority of this ordinance similarly to a loan made by HomeSight with Master Loan proceeds derived from the same fund source, subject to applicable regulations. The portfolio of loans covered by the Amended Agreement will consist of loans made with Master Loan proceeds, loans transferred by the City, loans made with funds derived from any loans in the portfolio and loans made from earnings on any such funds.

 * Except as provided in the next paragraph, the Amended Agreement shall require that revenues received by HomeSight with respect to the all loans in the portfolio, as well as earnings on those revenues prior to their use by HomeSight, be used for additional Homebuyer Assistance Loans for the purchase of homes within the City limits of Seattle, to home buyers with incomes at or below the lesser of 80% of median family income for the Seattle-Bellevue-Everett PMSA, adjusted for household size, or the income limit under rules applicable based on the fund source.

 * The Amended Agreement shall carry forward the terms of the MLA by which HomeSight may use, subject to specific limits, a portion of revenues derived from Home Buyer Assistance loans for costs associated with loan servicing.

 * All portfolio loans will be assigned to the City as security for the Master Promissory Note and the Loan Purchase Note.

 * The maximum Master Loan amount under the Amended Agreement shall be adjusted to reflect:

 (a) the fact the revenues from the 71 transferred loans will be received by HomeSight directly, not lent by the City;

 (b) the fact that City funds in the City's homebuyer revolving loan account established for the 1995 housing levy and revenues from loans made from that account will be lent directly to home buyers, and not to HomeSight (but HomeSight may perform loan origination and other services for the use of such funds under one or more separate agreements); and

 (c) the addition of the 2002 allocation made to HomeSight, other than the portion representing funds in such homebuyer revolving loan account.

 * The Amended Agreement shall permit clients of other non-profit organizations to access homebuyer assistance loans from HomeSight, if such clients meet the City's eligibility requirements and prudent underwriting standards.

 * The Amended Agreement shall include specific performance measures to be achieved by HomeSight, including dates for achieving such measures. Such measures may be developed annually. Annual changes made to such measures shall not constitute a material change to the amended agreement and therefore shall not require Council approval of such changes.

 * The Amended Agreement may provide for conditions upon which HomeSight may sell portfolio loans, and use other portfolio loans and/or funds derived from the portfolio to provide or replenish security required by a purchaser of portfolio loans.

 Note: Unless specifically referenced herein, all terms and conditions of the existing MLA, not inconsistent with the above terms or this ordinance, shall be incorporated into the Amended Agreement. ta
