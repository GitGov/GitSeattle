 TUNNEL EASEMENT

 Grant of Tunnel Easement. City of Seattle, a municipal corporation ("Grantor"), for and in consideration of Ten Dollars ($10.00 and other valuable consideration in hand paid), hereby conveys and warrants to the CENTRAL PUGET SOUND REGIONAL TRANSIT AUTHORITY ("Grantee"), a regional transit authority of the State of Washington, for the purposes described below, an exclusive permanent subsurface easement (the "Tunnel Easement") as described in Exhibit "A" and illustrated in Exhibit "C" attached hereto and incorporated herein by reference, lying below elevation 115 feet, North American Vertical Datum of 1988 (NAVD88), under the surface of and through the following described property ("Property"):

 SEE EXHIBIT "B" ATTACHED HERETO AND INCORPORATED HEREIN BY REFERENCE

 Grantee is authorized to purchase real property and real property interests under the provisions of RCW 81.112.080, and has the right of eminent domain under the provisions of RCW 81.112.080. By its Motion No. R2003-04, Grantee's Board of Directors authorized acquisition of the Tunnel Easement by negotiation or by exercise of eminent domain. In order to carry out its statutory duties and obligations under RCW 81.112, Grantee intends to acquire the Tunnel Easement for public purposes, i.e., for implementation of its ten-year plan (Sound Move) and its Central Link Light-Rail project (the "Project") through exercise of its power of eminent domain and has threatened to file a condemnation action unless Grantor agrees to sell the Tunnel Easement to Grantee. Therefore, this Tunnel Easement is granted in lieu of but under threat and imminence of condemnation.

 Purpose of Tunnel Easement. Grantee shall have the right to use the Tunnel Easement area for all purposes necessary or incidental to Grantee's operation, maintenance, use, modification, repair and replacement of underground tunnels and related public transportation facilities, including but not limited to the right to construct, operate, maintain, modify, repair, replace, improve, remove and use said tunnels, tunnel supports, roof, floor, and all utility lines or wires within said tunnels, together with the right to operate light rail trains and other public transportation vehicles and equipment within said tunnel, and for any related uses as Grantee may now or hereafter deem appropriate. All structures, materials, facilities, mechanical and electrical systems, utilities, equipment, furnishings or improvements of any kind that are acquired, constructed or installed in or upon the Easement area shall be and shall at all times remain the property of Grantee.

 Grantor's Use of Tunnel Easement. Grantor shall at all times conduct its activities and all other activities conducted on Grantor's property so as not to interfere with, obstruct or endanger the usefulness of any improvements, or other facilities, now or hereafter maintained by Grantee in the Tunnel Easement area, or in any way interfere with, obstruct or endanger the Grantee's use of the Tunnel Easement. Prior to any construction, work or any other activity by Grantor within the Tunnel Easement area, notification and plans for the same shall be submitted in writing to the Grantee by Grantor and no such construction, work or activity by Grantor shall be commenced without Grantee's prior written agreement that the Grantor's proposed construction, work or activity will not interfere with the Grantee's easement granted herein. The Grantee's review and approval of Grantor's plans, however, will not be evidence of adequacy or sufficiency of Grantor's plans and designs nor whether Grantor's construction, work or activity is in conformance with other applicable plans, codes and regulations.

 Representations and Indemnifications. Grantee represents that its activities within the Tunnel Easement area will not be heard nor will vibrations be felt by the Grantor during normal operation of the Project, and Grantor can continue to use the Property as it is now being used and for other purposes not requiring subsurface rights. Grantee shall repair any surface damage to the Property caused by the exercise of Grantee's easement rights at any time. Grantee shall implement, at its expense, a settlement-monitoring program during construction. In the event Grantee's representations as stated herein are demonstrated to be incorrect, Grantee agrees to indemnify, hold harmless and defend Grantor(s) from and against all damages, claims, and liabilities to the extent resulting therefrom, including attorney's fees and costs of suit, including any appeals thereof, except to the extent any of such damages, claims or liabilities result from the negligence or willful act of Grantor(s).

 Binding Effect. This Tunnel Easement is appurtenant to and shall run with all real property now owned or hereafter acquired by Grantee as part of the Central Link Light Rail project, which includes underground tunnels and related facilities in the Project area and operated by Grantee for high capacity transportation system purposes and shall inure to the benefit of Grantee, its successors and assigns and shall be binding upon the Property and Grantor, and their respective heirs, successors and assigns.

 Notices. Any notices required or permitted under this easement shall be given as indicated below:
