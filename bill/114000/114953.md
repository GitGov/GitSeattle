 AN ORDINANCE relating to the Department of Neighborhoods' Neighborhood Matching Fund program funding in 2004, removing restrictions that limit spending of an appropriation.

 WHEREAS, in 2003, the Department of Neighborhoods (DON) conducted extensive outreach to refugee and immigrant groups and people of color, to identify pressing concerns in their communities and types of projects that could address these issues; and

 WHEREAS, based on the community discussions, DON designed and implemented the 2003 Race Relations and Social Justice pilot program; and

 WHEREAS, an interdepartmental team of City staff reviewed the proposals, and, based on pre-determined criteria, recommended 21 groups for awards, which totaled $258,000 using unspent funds appropriated for the Neighborhood Matching Fund program; and

 WHEREAS, in adopting the 2004 budget, the City Council enacted budget provisos that imposed restrictions on spending from the Neighborhood Matching Subfund for race relations and social justice projects; and

 WHEREAS, the City Council wishes to see DON expand its outreach efforts citywide to encourage groups of people to collaborate on projects that improve awareness, understanding, and relations among different racial, ethnic, and cultural groups; and

 WHEREAS, the City Council sees the need for better connecting government with racial, ethnic and cultural groups to improve access, equity and fairness in government services, including the promotion of improved community-police relations; and

 WHEREAS, the City Council wishes to remove certain budgetary restrictions pertaining to spending Neighborhood Matching Fund appropriations on race relations and social justice projects;
