 AN ORDINANCE relating to Street and Sidewalk Use, amending Sections 15.04.074, 15.17.020, 15.17.050, 15.50.040, 15.50.070 and 15.50.080 of the Seattle Municipal Code; repealing Sections 15.48.050, 15.50.050, and 15.50.060; adding new Sections 15.17.080 and 15.48.900 and Chapter 15.91 to Title 15 of the Seattle Municipal Code; and adopting a new Street Use Permit Fee Schedule.

 WHEREAS, current city code disallows vending in the vicinity of the Kingdome, the Kingdome was demolished, and new sport stadiums have been constructed in the vicinity of where the Kingdome once stood that are attracting millions of fans to sporting events each year; and

 WHEREAS, many entrepreneurs have established small businesses in the public right-of-way surrounding the new sports stadiums selling food and merchandise to sports fans attending games; and

 WHEREAS, current city code strictly regulates street vending, does not permit street vending of merchandise from tables anywhere in the City, only allows street vending of food and flowers from a cart, and requires a Street Use Permit for anyone wishing to use the public right-of-way for vending or any other purpose; and

 WHEREAS, the excitement of attending a professional sporting event begins before one enters the stadium, street vendors contribute to the festive atmosphere of ball games, provide consumer choices at a competitive price, contribute to Seattle's tax base through the payment of Sales and Business and Occupation Taxes, and could operate as legitimate small businesses in Seattle if granted the authority to vend in the public right-of-way; and

 WHEREAS, street vending impacts the public health, safety and welfare and must be strictly regulated by Seattle Transportation in order to protect the public, a system of granting street use permits creates an easy and equitable means of regulating the activities of street vendors; and

 WHEREAS, the current enforcement system for processing Street and Sidewalk Use Code violations recognizes that the majority of citizens will voluntarily comply with the code requirements once they are aware of a violation; and

 WHEREAS, the current enforcement system can be changed to be more effective in dealing with the more difficult street and sidewalk use cases, particularly those involving repeat offenders and property owners who are unwilling to comply with the City's requirements; and

 WHEREAS, it is appropriate that the Street and Sidewalk Use Code should discourage repeat violations by imposing increasing penalties; and

 WHEREAS, enforcement of the Street and Sidewalk Use Code should efficiently use resources and focus the most resources on difficult cases; and

 WHEREAS, because violations of the Street and Sidewalk Use Code have a serious impact on the community, it is sometimes appropriate to assess a penalty irrespective of how quickly the violation is cured in order to deter such violations; and

 WHEREAS, it is appropriate to utilize this new enforcement tool on Street and Sidewalk Use Code violations that are readily and clearly identifiable; that have a significant impact on the surrounding community; and that include a high percentage of the Street and Sidewalk Use Code enforcement cases; and

 WHEREAS, Seattle Municipal Code Section 15.04.074 authorizes and directs the Director of Transportation to prepare and recommend for adoption a schedule of fees commensurate with the cost of administration, inspection and policing involved in the issuance and continuance of such permits and the use thereby granted; and

 WHEREAS, enforcement against violators is necessary to protect the public health, safety and welfare, and effective implementation of the street use permit program requires consistent ongoing enforcement against violators, even though most vendors will conduct their business in accordance with all rules and regulations required by a Street Use Permit; and

 WHEREAS, some vendors will not perceive the value of a street use permit and may not apply for a street use permit if they see that those conducting their business without a permit are able to do so without threat of sanction; and

 WHEREAS, the Department of Transportation must pay Inspectors to work overtime when enforcing the Street and Sidewalk Use Code on many game-days, and the Department of Transportation bears other costs for administration of this program, but has no other source of funds to cover the substantial costs of administering and enforcing this program; and

 WHEREAS, adopting the attached fee schedule will ensure that fees are commensurate with the cost of administration, inspection and policing involved in the issuance and continuance of such permits and the use thereby granted; NOW THEREFORE,

 C. Upon petition by a public agency for a vacation of street area, street use fees for such street area shall be suspended if the Director of Transportation finds that such public agency, as a current practice, would convey to, or permits use by, the City of a portion of the public agency's property for street or other public purpose without charge; provided, should the street vacation petition be denied, street use fees shall be payable for the full period of use.
