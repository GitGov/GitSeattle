 ORDINANCE __________________

 AN ORDINANCE relating to the Department of Parks and Recreation; authorizing the acquisition of real property located at the northeast corner of Delridge Way Southwest and Southwest Myrtle Street in the Delridge Neighborhood for open space, park, and recreation purposes; authorizing acceptance of the deed; and making an appropriation from the 2000 Parks Levy Fund for acquisition and related costs; all by a three-fourths vote of the City Council.

 WHEREAS, Ordinance 120024 proposed the Neighborhood Parks, Green Spaces, Trails, and Zoo Levy to provide funds for, among other things, the Delridge Open Space Acquisitions project comprising parcels along Longfellow Creek and Puget Ridge for watershed protection; and

 WHEREAS, the voters of Seattle approved the Neighborhood Parks, Green Spaces, Trails, and Zoo Levy on November 7, 2000; and

 WHEREAS, Ordinance 119789 incorporated the Delridge Neighborhood Plan goals and policies into the neighborhood plans volume of the Comprehensive Plan; and

 WHEREAS, the goals and policies of the Delridge Neighborhood Plan include the complementary visions of completing and improving "the open space network in Delridge in a way that integrates the residential and business environments with natural areas for public access and wildlife habitat," and of preserving and enhancing "the residential character of single family neighborhoods within the Delridge community while providing a range of housing types to fit the diversity of Delridge families;" and

 WHEREAS, the Delridge Neighborhood Open Space Plan attached to the Delridge Neighborhood Plan identifies the Puget Ridge Greenspace as the "wooded hillside to the east of Delridge Way running from approximately Southwest Dakota Street on the north to Southwest Orchard Street on the south... [that] serves as a visual backdrop for the Delridge Valley," and urges "preserving the most visually accessible of the undeveloped properties;" and

 WHEREAS, the Office of Housing has awarded Housing Levy funds to the Delridge Neighborhood Development Association ("DNDA") for the construction of affordable rental housing; and

 WHEREAS, DNDA has entered into a purchase and sale agreement for acquisition of six acres of real property along an undeveloped section of Croft Place SW ("the Croft Place properties") within the Longfellow Creek watershed and the Puget Ridge Greenspace; and

 WHEREAS, DNDA intends to develop three acres of the Croft Place properties with affordable rental housing and desires to assign its right to acquire the remaining three acres to The City of Seattle for open space, park, and recreation purposes; and

 WHEREAS, the Delridge Open Space Inventory (completed in March 2002 with assistance from a Department of Neighborhoods grant) identifies the Croft Place properties as high in priority for purchase as open space; and

 WHEREAS, the availability of the Croft Place properties for purchase as an assemblage presents a unique opportunity for The City of Seattle to help the Delridge community meet its complementary goals of affordable housing and preservation of open space;

 NOW THEREFORE,

 BE IT ORDAINED BY THE CITY OF SEATTLE AS FOLLOWS:

 Section 1. The Superintendent of Parks and Recreation or his designee is authorized, on behalf of The City of Seattle, to acquire the following described real property ("Property"):
