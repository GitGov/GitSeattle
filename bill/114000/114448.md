 Section 3. The pipes, conduits, and appurtenances described heretofore in Section 1 shall be laid down and maintained in such locations and in such manner as shall be directed by the Director of Seattle Department of Transportation ("Director"), and no construction, reconstruction, or repairing shall be done without first obtaining a permit therefor from the Director, which permit shall be subject to such reasonable inspection cost as is, or may from time to time be, provided by ordinance applicable to all privately owned public utilities, and said Permittee, its successors and assigns, shall comply with all the requirements and conditions of such permits and all ordinances of the City relating to construction in public places.

 Section 4. The permission granted hereby is subject to primary and secondary use by the public of the street, avenue, alley and public place rights-of-way for travel and utility purposes, and the City expressly reserves the right to require the Permittee, its successors or assigns, to relocate any of its or their pipes, conduits, or appurtenances at Permittee's sole cost and expense in the event that:

 a) The City Council determines, by ordinance, that the space occupied by said pipes, conduits, or appurtenances is necessary for any primary or secondary public use or benefit, or that said pipes, conduits, or appurtenances interfere with any primary or secondary public use or benefit; or

 b) The Director determines that any term or condition of this ordinance has been violated, and such violation has not been corrected by the Permittee within ninety (90) days after written notice of the violation has been sent by the City to the Permittee at its last known address.

 A City Council determination that the space is necessary for a primary or secondary public use or benefit shall be conclusive and final. The Permittee shall be entitled to seek review or reconsideration of a determination by the Director that the Permittee has violated a term or condition of this ordinance pursuant to the procedures for reconsideration of a Director's decision as provided in Seattle Municipal Code 15.04.112.

 Section 5. In the event that the permission hereby granted extends to its termination in fifty (50) years, Permittee, or its successors and assigns, shall consummate negotiations with the City for the continuation of said permission within one year after said termination of this permission. It is contemplated that the City will impose, and the Permittee, its successors or assigns, will accept reasonable terms and conditions. The question of the reasonableness of the terms and conditions imposed by the City shall be subject to judicial review pursuant to the standards set forth in R.C.W. 34.05.570(3). If, however, the Permittee, its successors or assigns, refuse to accept the permission upon such reasonable terms and conditions as determined by such judicial review, it shall, at its sole option, either 1) modify all or a portion of the pipes, conduits, and appurtenances such that they may be abandoned without damage to the streets, alleys and public places or risk of injury to the public, and remove all such pipes, conduits, and appurtenances which cannot be so modified from the streets, alleys and public places and shall replace the portions of said streets, alleys and public places which may be disturbed by such removal in accordance with the latest edition of the Director's rules for restoration of openings made in street and sidewalk pavement, or 2) transfer all of its interest in said pipes, conduits and appurtenances herein authorized in such streets, alleys and public places to a third party which is reasonably qualified to install, replace, renew, maintain and operate such pipes, conduits and appurtenances for the uses and purposes contemplated herein and which has been authorized by the City to do so.

 Section 6. The construction, reconstruction, replacement, maintenance and operation of any public or local improvement, or of any municipally owned public utility shall be done, insofar as practicable, in such a manner as not to disturb or injure the location of, nor obstruct, injure and prevent the free use or operation of the system of the Permittee, its successors or assigns, including its pipes, conduits and other necessary appurtenances. If the foregoing is not practicable, then the Permittee, its successors or assigns, within a reasonable time after notice from the Director, shall move, relocate and change any of its or their pipes, conduits, or appurtenances, which interfere with such public work. The moving, relocating or changing of any part of the system of the Permittee, its successors or assigns, shall be at the cost of the Permittee, its successors or assigns, where such pipes, conduits or appurtenances interfere with either the ordinary maintenance of any existing public or local improvement or the ordinary maintenance of any existing municipally owned public utility, or the construction, reconstruction, replacement or modification of any municipally owned public utility. Whenever any excavation shall be made pursuant to the authority hereby granted, Permittee, its successors and assigns, shall as soon as possible cause any such street, alley or public place so excavated to be restored to good order, condition and repair, and to the satisfaction of the Director.

 Section 7. The Permittee, its successors and assigns, shall promptly pay to the City in advance upon statements rendered by the Director an annual fee for the privileges granted and exercised hereunder of Ten Thousand Dollars ($10,000.00) until March 14, 2052, subject to adjustment as provided herein. The City may evaluate the fee at the end of every tenth year of the permission granted herein. Approval of an increase or decrease of the amount of the fee will be by resolution of the City Council. Such fee shall not be increased by more than Five Thousand Dollars ($5,000.00) for any ten-year period over the preceding ten-year period. All payments shall be made to the City Finance Director for credit to the General Fund.

 Section 8. The pipes, conduits, and appurtenances described herein shall remain the exclusive responsibility and property of the Permittee. The Permittee, by acceptance of this ordinance and the permission hereby granted, does release the City from any and all claims resulting from damage or loss to Permittee's property, except to the extent that such damage or loss is caused by the City or its employees or agents, and does covenant and agree for itself, its successors and assigns, with the City, to at all times defend, protect and save harmless the City from all claims, actions, suits, liability, loss, costs, expense or damages of every kind and description (except to the extent such claims, losses or damages result from the acts or omissions of the City or its employees or agents), which may accrue to, or be suffered by, any person or persons and/or property or properties, including without limitation, damage or injury to the Permittee, its officers, agents, employees, contractors, invitees, tenants and tenants' invitees or licensees, or its successors and assigns, by reason of the maintenance, operation or use of said pipes, conduits, and appurtenances, or any portion thereof, or by reason of anything that has been done, or may at any time be done, by the Permittee, its successors and assigns, as authorized by this ordinance, or by reason of the Permittee, its successors and assigns, failing or refusing to strictly comply with each and every provision of this ordinance. If any such suit, action or claim be filed, instituted or begun against the City, the Permittee, its successors or assigns, shall, upon notice thereof from the City, defend the same at its or their sole cost and expense, as provided above, and in case judgment shall be rendered against the City in any suit or action, the Permittee, its successors or assigns, shall satisfy said judgment as provided above within ninety (90) days after such action or suit shall have been finally determined, if determined adversely to the City. The City shall provide Permittee, its successors or assigns, notice of any suit, action or claim for which the City seeks a defense under this Section within sixty (60) days after it receives notice of such suit, action or claim. Provided that if it is determined by a court of competent jurisdiction that R.C.W. 4.24.115 applies to this ordinance, then in the event claims or damages are caused by or result from the concurrent negligence of:

 (a) the City, its agents, contractors or employees; and,

 (b) the Permittee, its agents, contractors, employees or its successors or assigns, this defense and indemnity provision shall be valid and enforceable only to the extent of the negligence of the Permittee or the Permittee's agents, contractors, employees or its successors or assigns.

 Section 9. The Permittee, its successors and assigns shall not assign or transfer any privileges conferred by this ordinance without the consent of the City Council by resolution.

If permission is granted, the assignee or transferee shall be bound by all terms and conditions of this ordinance.

 The coverages provided by this policy to The City of Seattle shall not be terminated, reduced or otherwise materially changed without providing at least forty-five (45) days prior written notice to The City of Seattle."

 (3) Any other additional insured endorsement form or clause approved by the City.

 E.

 Section 12. The Permittee shall require that any and all of its contractors performing construction work in streets, avenues, alleys and other public places in the City of Seattle as contemplated by this permit, name the City of Seattle as an additional insured on all policies of public liability insurance, and shall include in all contract documents a provision extending construction indemnities and warranties granted to Permittee to the City as well.

 b) insert in any contract for work undertaken in connection with the laying down, replacement, renewal, maintenance and operation of pipes, conduits and other necessary appurtenances referenced in this ordinance language substantially similar to the language contained in this Section 13 and which requires any person or entity entering into such contract to comply with the non discrimination provisions of this Section.

 Section 14. Within sixty (60) days after the effective date of this ordinance the Permittee shall deliver to the Director of Seattle Department of Transportation for filing with the City Clerk a good and sufficient bond in the sum of Twenty-Five Thousand Dollars ($25,000.00), executed by a surety company authorized and qualified to do business in the State of Washington, conditioned that the Permittee will comply with each and every provision of this ordinance and with each and every order of the Director pursuant thereto; provided, that if the Mayor of the City of Seattle in his/her judgment shall deem any bond or bonds filed to be insufficient and demand a new or additional bond, the Permittee shall furnish a new or additional bond in such amount as the Mayor may reasonably specify to be necessary to fully protect the City. Said bond shall remain in effect until such time as the pipes, conduits and appurtenances are entirely removed from their location as described in Section 1, or the Director discharges the Permittee from responsibility under this ordinance.

 Section 15. The Permittee shall deliver its written acceptance of the permission conferred by this ordinance and its terms and conditions to the Director of Seattle Department of Transportation within sixty (60) days after the effective date of this ordinance.
