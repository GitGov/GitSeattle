To this end, errors in showing the preexisting Seattle Municipal Code or uncodified ordinances are to be disregarded, and no change in the Seattle Municipal Code is intended thereby.

 Section 26. It is the express intent of the City Council that, in the event another ordinance has heretofore been enacted that amended any section or subsection of the Seattle Municipal Code amended or recodified herein, that earlier amendment should be effectuated with equal dignity to this ordinance if at all possible in the codification of the Seattle Municipal Code and by the courts, notwithstanding the use in this ordinance of an obsolete version of that part of the Seattle Municipal Code on which to show intended amendments.

 Section 27. In the event any section or subsection of the Seattle Municipal Code purported to be amended or recodified herein has heretofore been repealed, the earlier repeal shall be given full effect, and nothing in this ordinance shall be construed to reenact or preserve that section or subsection.

 Section 28. It is the express intent of the City Council that, in the event a subsequent ordinance refers to a position or office that was abolished by this ordinance, that reference shall be deemed to be to the new position or office created by this ordinance, and shall not be construed to resurrect the old position or office unless it expressly so provides by reference to this ordinance.

 Section 29. It is the express intent of the City Council that, in the event a subsequent ordinance refers to or amends a section or subsection of the Seattle Municipal Code or a previously enacted ordinance that is amended or recodified herein, but the later ordinance fails to account for the change made by this ordinance, the two sets of amendments should be given effect together if at all possible.

 Section 30. The several provisions of this ordinance are declared to be separate and severable and the invalidity of any clause, sentence, paragraph, subdivision, section, or portion of this ordinance, or the invalidity of the application thereof to any person or circumstance, shall not affect the validity of the remainder of this ordinance or the validity of its application to other persons or circumstances.

 Section 31. Any act consistent with the authority and prior to the effective date of this ordinance is hereby ratified and confirmed.

 Section 32. This ordinance shall take effect and be in force thirty (30) days from and after its approval by the Mayor, but if not approved and returned by the Mayor within ten (10) days after presentation, it shall take effect as provided by Municipal Code Section 1.04.020.
