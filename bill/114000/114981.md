 ORDINANCE __________

 AN ORDINANCE relating to proposed streetcar lines in Seattle; stating the conditions under which the Seattle City Council will consider approving construction of a streetcar line in South Lake Union; and releasing certain funds to the Seattle Department of Transportation to proceed with preliminary plan development, compliance with SEPA procedures, design, and engineering for a potential South Lake Union Streetcar project and to undertake a preliminary review of a potential extension of the proposed South Lake Union alignment to the University District and a potential extension of the Waterfront Streetcar along the South Jackson Street Corridor.

 WHEREAS, in Resolution 30610, the Seattle City Council affirmed its commitment to support the redevelopment of the South Lake Union area as the region's most competitive location for biotech and high-tech research and manufacturing; and

 WHEREAS, the Seattle City Council has taken numerous actions in support of the redevelopment of South Lake Union for this purpose, including selling City property in South Lake Union to enable its redevelopment, approving zoning adjustments that support biotech, allowing certain modifications to building height restrictions, adding South Lake Union to the City's multi-family tax exemption program, contributing to the development of 226 low-income housing units, and contributing funds towards the development and improvement of South Lake Union Park and Cascade Playground; and

 WHEREAS, the Seattle City Council will be considering additional measures that would further promote economic development in South Lake Union, such as adjusting zoning in certain areas to enable multi-family residential development, making improvements to the pedestrian environment, and designating South Lake Union as an Urban Center, which could make it eligible for certain grants and other priority funding; and

 WHEREAS, the City Council appreciates the efforts and enthusiasm by certain parties to build a streetcar in South Lake Union as a possible way to accelerate development to the area and provide additional public transportation alternatives; and

 WHEREAS, the City of Seattle has made budget reductions of approximately one hundred million dollars in the last three years and continues to face challenges in maintaining city services; and

 WHEREAS, the City's transportation infrastructure requires more than five hundred million dollars worth of investment to maintain street surfaces and bridges; and

 WHEREAS, while the Seattle City Council believes that a South Lake Union streetcar could provide an additional attraction to development in South Lake Union, the Council is concerned about using scarce City resources for the streetcar capital costs and future operating and maintenance given the longstanding needs in other neighborhoods and the challenges of maintaining adequate funding levels for city services and transportation infrastructure maintenance; and

 WHEREAS, while a streetcar may have the potential to help organize and accelerate development in South Lake Union, development in South Lake Union is proceeding at a rapid pace and it is not likely dependent on the installation of a streetcar line; and

 WHEREAS, the City of Seattle is willing to pay a special assessment not exceeding any special benefit accruing to its property within a Local Improvement District (LID) for a South Lake Union streetcar if a Special Benefits Study is conducted and if sufficient property owners within the proposed Local Improvement District boundaries, including the City of Seattle, support formation of a Local Improvement District for the purposes of constructing a South Lake Union Streetcar; and

 WHEREAS, the City has secured and continues to pursue public grants to help pay for the construction of the South Lake Union Streetcar; and

 WHEREAS, the Executive is encouraged to review how other cities pay for the operation and maintenance costs associated with streetcars, such as in Tampa, Florida, which created an assessment district and endowment fund to pay for its streetcar's operations and maintenance costs.

 WHEREAS, the Seattle City Council encourages interested parties to continue working on identifying non-City funds to build and operate the streetcar; and

 WHEREAS, the City Council affirms its support for the extension of the existing Waterfront streetcar through the Chinatown/International District along the South Jackson Street corridor to 12th Avenue South initially and then to 23rd Avenue South, and requests the Executive join the Council in recommending the consideration and study of this route as part of Sound Transit Phase II and in setting this as the next priority for securing transit-related grants; and

 WHEREAS, the City Council encourages the Executive to develop plans for a more extensive and linked streetcar network, to include: the South Lake Union streetcar with possible extensions to the University District; the Waterfront streetcar with possible extensions to the south and east on Jackson to the Central District as noted in Section 1F of the June 30th Seattle Streetcar Network and Feasibility Analysis, possible relocation or extension on Western Avenue with connections to the Seattle Center and South Lake Union, and possible extensions to the north, including Fremont and Ballard; and a single maintenance base to maximize efficiency and reduce costs; NOW THEREFORE,

 BE IT ORDAINED BY THE CITY OF SEATTLE AS FOLLOWS:

 Section 1. The Seattle City Council will consider approving a streetcar project for South Lake Union and releasing additional funds, beyond those authorized in this ordinance, to proceed with further planning, compliance with SEPA procedures, design, engineering and construction of a South Lake Union Streetcar, only if all the following conditions are satisfied:

 A. Except as otherwise provided in this ordinance, the City of Seattle will not financially contribute to or be responsible for any costs associated with the administration of the construction, administration of a Local Improvement District (LID), design, engineering, construction or any other capital costs, including any project cost overruns and financing costs, associated with the South Lake Union streetcar, except for any special assessment the City may be responsible for as a property owner within a streetcar LID. In order to demonstrate compliance with this condition, the Executive must present a funding plan that addresses how the capital costs of the South Lake Union Streetcar will be paid for and how any potential cost overruns will be addressed.

 B. All necessary grants and other funds required for the construction and any other capital costs of a South Lake Union streetcar are certain and have been identified.

 C. Streetcar operations and maintenance will be funded without using existing City General Fund dollars, and any future general fund revenues except as noted in this subsection. To demonstrate compliance with this condition, the Executive will present a long- range, sustainable business plan that covers all operation and maintenance costs associated with the South Lake Union Streetcar and that relies on a realistic fare box recovery strategy and ridership estimates. The business plan shall acknowledge and adhere to the funding restrictions outlined in this ordinance. This subsection C does not preclude the Executive from presenting a business plan that proposes to use developer fees or other new revenue sources that are specifically devised to pay for the costs of the proposed South Lake Union streetcar, as long as the use of those revenue sources are consistent with City policy approved by the Council.

 D. No funds resulting from the sale of surplus City property in South Lake Union may be used to support the operations and maintenance of the proposed South Lake Union Streetcar. No funds resulting from the sale of surplus property in South Lake Union may be used to support construction of the proposed South Lake Union Streetcar, except as the City Council may authorize in accordance with Resolution 30334.

 E. The City Council will not preclude consideration of the use of new, incremental Metro bus hours that the City of Seattle may be entitled to, so long as it is demonstrated that the use of those hours for the SLU Streetcar represent a responsible, effective, and efficient allocation of the City's share of Metro bus service hours.

 F. An existing transit agency is willing, able, and legally committed to operating and maintaining the South Lake Union streetcar.

 G. A Special Benefits Study, per the ordinance introduced as C.B. 114982, has been completed so that the City Council can determine the appropriate level and allocation of assessments for a potential streetcar LID.

 H. Given that the LID is a critical piece of funding for the streetcar, the City Council has held a preliminary LID formation hearing to determine property owner support for a streetcar LID.

 I. The City Council has reviewed the results of the preliminary design and engineering allowed for under this ordinance, after the Seattle Design Commission and Seattle Planning Commission have had the opportunity to review and comment on the preliminary design plans.

 Section 2. The restrictions imposed by the following budget provisos are removed to the extent of the modifications shown:
