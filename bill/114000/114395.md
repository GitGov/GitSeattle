 AN ORDINANCE relating to automatic alarm systems; increasing the monetary penalty for certain false alarms and amending Chapter 10.08 of the Seattle Municipal Code.

 WHEREAS, it is found to be true that more than 98% of all automatic property and burglary alarm signal activations are false alarms; and

 WHEREAS, it is found to be true that automatic property and burglary alarm signal activations are the second most frequent call for police service; and

 WHEREAS, it is found to be true that an exorbitant amount of police resources and monies are devoted to false alarms without recovery under the current fine system; and

 WHEREAS, increasing the seriousness of the level of civil infraction for false alarms may provide greater recovery of the costs of unnecessary police responses; NOW THEREFORE

 The sending of an alarm by an automatic property alarm and/or automatic burglary alarm, which results in the dispatch of the police to the premises on an emergency basis, is a civil infraction and shall be processed as contemplated by RCW Chapter 7.80 whenever: (A) there is no evidence of a crime or other activity that would warrant a call for immediate police assistance or investigation at the premises; and (B) no individual who was on or near the premises, or who had viewed a video communication from the premises, called for the dispatch or confirmed a need for an immediate police response. The infraction shall be charged to the alarm system user who shall be assessed a monetary penalty. It shall be classified as a Class ((3)) 2 civil infraction under RCW 7.80.120.

Each day of noncompliance shall be a separate violation, and the monetary penalties shall accumulate.
