 AN ORDINANCE relating to the Community Development Block Grant Float Loan Program; authorizing a short-term loan of up to THREE MILLION ONE HUNDRED THOUSAND AND NO/100 DOLLARS ($3,100,000) in Block Grant funds to YouthCare, a Washington nonprofit corporation, to finance site acquisition of 975 John Street in the South Lake Union neighborhood for the Orion Center; authorizing amendments to the 2001-2004 Consolidated Plan and 2002 Action Plan to reflect such loan; appropriating funds for the loan and for possible new advances after early repayments, and ratifying and confirming prior acts.

 WHEREAS, the City Council, by Ordinance 116402, adopted policies for short-term loans of Community Development Block Grant ("CDBG") funds, known as "CD Float Loans"; and

 WHEREAS, the Director of the Office of Economic Development and the City's Community Development Block Grant Float Loan Committee have approved a short term loan (the "Loan") to YouthCare to finance site acquisition costs of 975 John Street in the South Lake Union neighborhood for the Orion Center (the "Project"), which Project will provide outreach services to Seattle area homeless youth, at least 51% of whom will be low- and moderate-income persons; and

 WHEREAS, the Project will benefit low- and moderate-income persons, which will satisfy the CD Float Loan policies and eligibility requirements, and the City's Loan Committee has approved the proposed Loan in accordance with those policies and eligibility requirements; and

 WHEREAS, the making of the proposed Loan will not impair the implementation of other projects or programs of the City using CDBG funds;

 NOW, THEREFORE,

 BE IT ORDAINED BY THE CITY OF SEATTLE AS FOLLOWS:

 Section 1. The Director of the Office of Economic Development ("OED Director") is authorized, for and on behalf of The City of Seattle, to lend up to THREE MILLION ONE HUNDRED THOUSAND AND NO/100 DOLLARS ($3,100,000) of CDBG funds (which may include available CDBG program income), subject to availability of sufficient CDBG funds, to YouthCare, a Washington nonprofit corporation, to finance the acquisition costs of real property for the Orion Center project to be located at 975 John Street in the South Lake Union neighborhood, subject to the terms and conditions stated in this ordinance. The amount of up to THREE MILLION ONE HUNDRED THOUSAND AND NO/100 DOLLARS ($3,100,000) is hereby appropriated from the Housing and Community Development Revenue Sharing Fund for such purpose.

 Section 2. The principal amount the Loan shall be payable upon the earlier of: (i) thirty (30) months from the date of Loan closing, (ii) sixty (60) days prior to the expiration of the letter of credit securing the Loan, or (iii) demand by the City. The Loan shall bear interest at a rate of two percent (2%) per annum. Interest shall be payable when principal becomes due or upon earlier demand by the City. The OED Director may require a loan fee from YouthCare, payable to the City, not to exceed one percent (1%) of the maximum Loan amount, which fee shall be deposited in the Housing and Community Development Revenue Sharing Fund. The OED Director is authorized to cause all or a portion of such fee to be (a) paid to the National Development Council ("NDC") in accordance with an existing contract under which NDC develops and facilitates eligible CD Float Loan projects; (b) applied to legal and other costs related to the administration of the transaction authorized by this ordinance; and/or (c) applied to payment of expenses incurred in the administration of any federally funded economic development loan projects or programs administered by the OED Director. The amount of up to THIRTY-ONE THOUSAND AND NO/100 DOLLARS ($31,000) is hereby appropriated for such purposes from the Housing and Community Development Revenue Sharing Fund, subject to receipt of such funds in payment of the Loan fee.

 Section 3. The Loan shall be secured by an irrevocable letter of credit that shall have a total amount available for drawing, at all times, at least equal to the outstanding principal amount and accrued interest, plus all additional interest that will accrue on the principal until its scheduled maturity. The letter of credit shall be issued by a commercial bank satisfactory to the OED Director and shall be in form and content satisfactory to the OED Director.

 Section 4. Disbursement of the Loan shall be conditioned upon satisfactory environmental review in accordance with HUD requirements, and upon other conditions required by law or deemed appropriate by the OED Director.

 Section 5. The OED Director is hereby authorized to execute, deliver, accept, administer, modify and enforce, as appropriate, for and on behalf of the City, a Loan Agreement and Promissory Note, evidencing the Loan authorized hereby, based upon the forms attached hereto as Exhibits A and B with such insertions, additions and revisions as he shall deem appropriate to implement the intent of this ordinance.

 Section 6. In order that the OED Director may exercise the authority granted in Ordinance 119932 to make new advances on the Loan after any early payment(s) that may be required so that the City may meet temporary cash requirements for CDBG activities pending the City's receipt of its annual CDBG entitlement from HUD, there is hereby appropriated from the Housing and Community Development Revenue Sharing Fund an additional amount of up to THREE MILLION ONE HUNDRED THOUSAND AND NO/100 DOLLARS ($3,100,000), conditioned upon the availability of sufficient CDBG funds (including program income), solely for new advances on the Loan in a total amount not exceeding the total amount of such early payment(s), and subject to the limits in Ordinance 119932. The principal balance outstanding on the Loan at any time shall not exceed THREE MILLION ONE HUNDRED THOUSAND AND NO/100 DOLLARS ($3,100,000).

 Section 7. The OED Director is hereby authorized to take such other actions and execute and deliver such other documents as shall be reasonably necessary or appropriate to carry out the intent of this ordinance.

 Section 8. Payments of interest on the Loan and principal repayments shall be deposited in the Housing and Community Development Revenue Sharing Fund, and may be expended pursuant to any past or future appropriations of CDBG funds, whether in the annual budget or otherwise, unless such other appropriations are limited by their express terms to CDBG program income from other programs.

 Section 9. The Director of the Human Services Department ("HSD Director") is authorized to amend the City of Seattle's Consolidated Plan, including the 2002 Action Plan component thereof, to include the necessary information about the Loan authorized in this ordinance. The HSD Director is authorized to make such additions and modifications to the description of the Project as may be necessary to obtain HUD approval or to reflect minor changes in the Project. Such Director is further authorized to take such other actions as are appropriate to implement the intent of this ordinance under HUD regulations, and to provide necessary assurances to HUD.

 Section 10. Any act pursuant to the authority and prior to the effective date of this ordinance is hereby ratified and confirmed.

 Section 11. This ordinance shall take effect and be in force thirty (30) days from and after its approval by the Mayor; but if not approved and returned by the Mayor within ten (10) days after presentation, it shall take effect as provided by Municipal Code Section 1.04.020.

 EXHIBIT A TO ORDINANCE

 COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT BLOCK GRANT FLOAT LOAN AGREEMENT YOUTHCARE CDBG FLOAT LOAN

 THIS AGREEMENT, dated ________________________, 2002, is entered into by YOUTHCARE, a Washington nonprofit corporation ("Borrower"), and THE CITY OF SEATTLE, a Washington municipal corporation ("City").

 RECITALS

 This Agreement is entered into upon the basis of the following facts and circumstances:

 A. Borrower plans to acquire real property located at 975 John Street in the South Lake Union neighborhood and described in Attachment A and made a part hereof (collectively, the "Property").

 B. Borrower plans to use the Property for the benefit of low- and moderate income persons and, more particularly, to relocate and expand the Orion Center, a multi-service center that provides outreach services to Seattle area homeless youth. The Orion Center is generally described in Attachment B attached hereto and made a part hereof. The acquisition of the Property and its renovation and conversion to serve as the Orion Center are hereinafter collectively called the "Project".

 C. The Office of Economic Development ("OED") is responsible within the City for making, subject to City Council approval, short-term loans of Community Development Block Grant ("CDBG") funds made available to the City by the United States Department of Housing and Urban Development ("HUD"), known as "CD Float" loans, pursuant to the Housing and Community Development Act of 1974, as amended, and the federal regulations promulgated thereunder (hereinafter collectively called the "Act").

 D. Borrower has requested a CD Float loan from the City (the "Loan") as short-term financing to finance the costs to acquire the Property.

 E. The Loan meets a national objective under the CDBG program by providing benefit to low and moderate income persons through limited clientele activities, as provided in 24 C.F.R. section570.208(a)(2). The activity funded hereunder is eligible under the CDBG program as provided in 24 C.F.R. section570.201(a) as an acquisition activity.

 F. The Loan shall be evidenced by this Agreement and by a promissory note to be executed by Borrower ("Note"), and secured by an unconditional irrevocable letter of credit from a financial institution acceptable to City (the "Bank"), payable upon demand. The Note, this Agreement, and any other documents or instruments executed by Borrower in favor of City pursuant to this Agreement or in connection with the Loan are collectively referred to as the "Loan Documents".

 NOTICE: ORAL AGREEMENTS OR ORAL COMMITMENTS TO LOAN MONEY, EXTEND CREDIT, OR TO FORBEAR FROM ENFORCING REPAYMENT OF A DEBT, ARE NOT ENFORCEABLE UNDER WASHINGTON LAW.

 NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing recitals and the covenants, conditions, representations and warranties contained herein, the parties agree as follows:

 ARTICLE I - THE LOAN

 1.1 The Loan. In reliance upon Borrower's representations and warranties, and subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement and the other Loan Documents, the City agrees to lend Borrower a sum of money not to exceed THREE MILLION ONE HUNDRED THOUSAND AND NO/100 DOLLARS ($3,100,000) solely for the purposes set forth in this Agreement. Loan disbursements shall be made only to the extent of available funds received by City from HUD under the CDBG program (and any available program income derived from such funds), not yet required for any other CDBG-funded program or project of the City, and the City shall have no obligation to make disbursements from any other source or to disburse any Loan proceeds if funds from the CDBG program are unavailable. Borrower shall have the right to receive Loan funds from the City only pursuant to the terms and conditions of this Agreement and in accordance with the Act.

 1.2 Interim Financing Only. The Loan is made solely to provide interim financing to finance Borrower's costs to acquire the Property for the Project, as set forth in Attachment B, and any other eligible costs of the Project approved by the OED Director.

 1.3 Loan Documentation, Interest and Security. The Loan shall be evidenced by this Agreement and by the Note. Payment of interest and principal shall be made in the amounts and at such times as is set forth in the Note. Any principal or interest outstanding after the date when payment is due shall bear interest at the default rate stated in the Note. The Loan at all times shall be secured by an irrevocable, unconditional letter of credit (the "Letter of Credit") from a bank acceptable to City in its sole discretion, which Letter of Credit shall allow partial drawings and shall be in form and content acceptable to City in its sole discretion, with an available balance at least equal to the sum of the full balance outstanding on the Loan (including principal and accrued interest) plus all interest that will accrue on the principal prior to the due date thereof, plus thirty (30) days' interest on the entire outstanding balance, and with an expiration date at least sixty (60) days after the Maturity Date (as defined in the Note).

 1.4 Method of Payment. Unless otherwise requested by the City, all principal payments and payment of accrued interest shall be made by draw on the Letter of Credit. When any principal payment is due under the Note, whether or not Borrower shall be in default, the City shall have the absolute right, without notice or demand, immediately to draw on the Letter of Credit for the amount of principal and interest then due. If the full principal balance does not become due prior to the Maturity Date stated in the Note, then the City shall endeavor to give Borrower and Bank at least seven (7) calendar days' advance notice of its intent to draw on the Letter of Credit at the Maturity Date stated in the Note, but the failure to give such notice shall not in any way affect the City's right to draw on the Letter of Credit or result in any liability of the City. In addition, in its sole discretion, the City shall have the right, without notice or demand, to draw on the Letter of Credit all or any portion of any principal amount payable or prepaid hereunder, notwithstanding receipt of all or part of such amount from Borrower. In such case, the City shall promptly thereafter return the payment made by Borrower to the extent necessary to avoid duplication in payments.

 1.5 Loan Fee. Borrower agrees to pay to City a loan fee of one percent (1%) of the maximum principal amount of the Loan, which shall be due in full on the date of first disbursement of Loan proceeds under this Agreement. Borrower authorizes the City to deduct such fee from the Loan proceeds.

 ARTICLE II - REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES

 In order to induce City to make the Loan, Borrower represents and warrants as set forth below in this Article II. Each request for a draw on the Loan by Borrower shall constitute a representation and warranty that the facts set forth below are true and correct as of the execution hereof and as of the date of such request. These representations and warranties shall survive the execution, delivery and performance of the Loan Documents and the repayment of the Loan.

 2.1 Authority. Borrower is an entity of the type stated on the first page of this Agreement, duly organized and validly existing under the laws of the State indicated, and has full power and authority to enter into this Agreement, to borrow money as contemplated herein and to execute and carry out the provisions of the Loan Documents. Borrower has not made any change in its articles of incorporation, bylaws, board of directors, or corporate purposes and activities since the date of the information submitted to the City, except as expressly disclosed in writing to OED. The execution, delivery and performance of this Agreement and the Loan Documents have been duly authorized by all necessary action, and no other action of Borrower is required for the execution, delivery and performance of this Agreement or the Loan Documents. This Agreement and the Note constitute valid and binding obligations of Borrower, each enforceable in accordance with their respective terms. The execution, delivery and performance of the Loan Documents and the transactions contemplated thereby have been duly authorized by all necessary action by Borrower.

 2.2 Investigation of Property; No Reliance on City. Borrower has conducted its own thorough investigation of the Property, including without limitation investigations with respect to prior uses and hazardous materials. Borrower is not relying in any way upon any statements or representations made by or on behalf of the City with respect to any of the Property, and Borrower agrees that the City has no obligation to investigate or disclose to Borrower any information that may be in the possession of the City with respect to any of the Property.

 2.3 No Litigation. There is no action, suit or proceeding pending, or to the knowledge of Borrower threatened, against or affecting Borrower or relating to the Project or the Property in any court of law or in equity, or before or by any governmental authority contesting the legality of the Project or of any of the terms and conditions of the Loan Documents, or that might adversely affect the ability of Borrower to perform its obligations under any of the Loan Documents.

 2.4 Title. Borrower has, or will have upon disbursement of Loan funds for completion of acquisition, clear title to the Property, subject to no material liens or encumbrances except as may be granted to secure the Letter of Credit or as may otherwise be approved by the City in its discretion.

 2.5 Covenants, Zoning and Codes. Borrower has complied to date and will continue to comply with all applicable environmental and land use statutes, regulations, ordinances and covenants applicable to Borrower's development and intended use of the Property.

 2.6 Project and Application. The description of the Project set forth in Attachment B hereto is an accurate description of the Project. All information contained in Borrower's application for the Loan and all additional information submitted to the City by or on behalf of Borrower in connection with such application is true, complete and correct in all material respects. Borrower represents and warrants that Borrower reasonably expects that each year (beginning upon completion of the Project and continuing for a period of five (5) years), at least eight hundred (800) youths per year, on an unduplicated basis, will be served at the Project.

 2.7 Compliance with Documents. Borrower is and will remain in full compliance with all of the terms and conditions of the Loan Documents and any and all other agreements, instruments and other documents affecting the Property or the Project, and no event of default has or shall have occurred and be continuing, which, with the lapse of time or the giving of notice, or both, would constitute such an event of default under any of the foregoing.

 ARTICLE III -- CONDITIONS PRECEDENT TO LOAN DISBURSEMENT; TIMING AND METHOD OF DISBURSEMENTS

 3.1 Conditions Precedent. No funds shall be considered obligated for any purpose under this Loan Agreement until all conditions to the disbursement of such funds the Borrower shall have satisfied, or waived by the City, in the City's discretion. The City's obligation to perform its duties under this Agreement and to disburse the Loan proceeds shall be subject to the full and complete satisfaction of the following conditions precedent:

 (a) Documents. Prior to the first disbursement, the City shall have received fully executed originals of each of the following documents which shall have been duly authorized, executed and delivered by the parties thereto, and shall be in form and content satisfactory to City: this Agreement; the Note; the Letter of Credit; and any and all other documents as City may deem necessary or appropriate with respect to the Loan.

 (b) Evidence of Authority; Opinions. Prior to the first disbursement, the City shall have received evidence satisfactory to it that Borrower and the persons signing on behalf of Borrower have the capacity and authority to execute and deliver Loan Documents on behalf of Borrower. If so requested by the City, Borrower shall provide an opinion of legal counsel, in form and content acceptable to the City, addressing the valid existence and status of Borrower, the due authorization, execution, delivery, binding effect and enforceability of the Loan Documents, and the fact that the execution, delivery and performance of the Loan Documents do not violate, cause a default under, or conflict with, any applicable laws or regulations, or any judgments, orders, decrees, agreements or instruments known to such counsel affecting Borrower or the Property. Borrower shall provide or cause the Bank to provide satisfactory evidence of the authority of the individuals executing the Letter of Credit and, if so requested by the City, an opinion of counsel for the Bank as to the valid existence and status of Bank and the due authorization, execution, delivery, binding effect and enforceability of the Letter of Credit.

 (c) Conditions to Each Disbursement. The City's obligation to make each disbursement shall be subject to satisfaction of the following conditions:

 (1) Receipt by City of any documents and assurances as it may reasonably request or that are required by HUD or any federal, state or county regulatory agency;

 (2) City shall have received and have in its possession sufficient Community Development Block Grant funds (which may include CDBG program income), from grant years through and including 2002, and not otherwise required to meet commitments of City, to fund the Loan;

 (3) Borrower shall be in full compliance and shall not be in default hereunder or under any other Loan Documents, provided, however, that City may, in its discretion, elect to disburse the Loan proceeds notwithstanding the existence of a default, and the disbursement shall be deemed to have been made pursuant to this Agreement and shall be secured by the Letter of Credit;

 (4) Borrower shall have provided satisfactory documentation that it has paid or incurred costs eligible for Loan funds, and shall have supplied all documentation required by the City to support such costs (including, in the case of payments to contractors, vendors, consultants or service providers, copies of contracts complying with this agreement and invoices acceptable to the City; and in the case of property acquisition, purchase agreements, closing statements and appraisals acceptable to the City);

 (5) There shall be no legal or administrative action pending or threatened seeking to enjoin or prevent the Project or operation of the Property as contemplated in the Loan Documents, or contesting the legality of any of the arrangements contemplated by the Loan Documents or any other financing for the Project, and no order, judgment, finding, or ruling of any court or administrative agency shall be in effect that would prohibit, restrain, create reasonable uncertainty as to the legality of, or otherwise adversely affect, the completion of the Project, the funding of the Project as contemplated hereby, or the operation of the Property as contemplated in the Loan Documents.

 All conditions to disbursement herein are for the sole protection and benefit of the City, and may be waived in the discretion of the City. No waiver of any condition for purposes of one disbursement shall affect the City's right to withhold further disbursements based on failure to satisfy such condition, nor affect the City's right to pursue remedies at any time for any default.

 3.2 Timing and Method of Disbursements. Subject to the terms of this Agreement and the availability of funds, City shall normally disburse funds within seven (7) days after all conditions to disbursement are satisfied hereunder. The City may, at its option, make Loan disbursements directly to vendors or others entitled to payment from Borrower, as indicated by Borrower's request for disbursement, or by checks payable jointly to Borrower and such persons. For acquisition of the Property, the City may, at its option, disburse funds to an escrow agent acceptable to the City that is closing the purchase and sale of the Property, for release upon the recording of the deed to Borrower, the receipt of a closing statement approved by the City, delivery of the Letter of Credit, and such other documentation as the City may require. Unless otherwise agreed in writing by OED, no further Loan disbursements shall be available after September 1, 2002.

 ARTICLE IV -- GENERAL LOAN COVENANTS

 Borrower covenants and agrees as follows:

 4.1 General. From and after the date hereof and so long as any amount remains unpaid on the Note, Borrower covenants and agrees that it will promptly pay principal and interest pursuant to the Note as and when the same becomes due and payable. Borrower further covenants and agrees that Borrower shall comply with each and every other obligation of Borrower under the Loan Documents and any other agreements or instruments related to the financing and development of the Project.

 4.2 Completion of Project; Plan of Development. There shall be no material change to Borrower's plans for development of the Property as described in Attachment B to this Agreement without the prior written approval of OED, in its discretion. Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement and applicable laws and regulations, Borrower shall carry out the Project in accordance with Attachment B, including without limitation the schedule set forth therein.

 4.3 Call Provision. In addition to, and not in any way to be deemed any limitation upon, City's right to demand repayment of the Loan at any time, City may call the Loan immediately due and payable without notice and may draw on the Letter of Credit, at City's option, if at any time during the term of the Loan without City's prior written approval:

 (a) Borrower sells, transfers or assigns (except for security purposes) all or substantially all of Borrower's interest in the Property, whether voluntarily or involuntarily, or by the operation of law;

 (b) there is not a Letter of Credit securing the Loan that complies strictly with all requirements of this Agreement; or

 (c) there occurs any breach or default under the terms of the Note, this Agreement or any other Loan Document that is not remedied in full within any applicable cure period.

 In addition, upon the occurrence of any of the foregoing, City may declare an Event of Default hereunder and exercise its rights and remedies under Article VI.

 4.4 Inspections. The City and its representatives shall have the right at all reasonable times during regular business hours (and at any time in the event of an emergency) to enter upon and inspect the Property to determine that the same is in conformity with this Agreement and all laws, ordinances, rules and regulations applicable to Borrower's use of the Loan funds. City shall have the further right, from time to time, to inspect Borrower's books and records relating to Borrower's use of the Loan funds, provided that the City gives Borrower not less than forty-eight (48) hours notice except in any case of investigation of allegations of fraud or misuse of funds. Without limiting the foregoing, Borrower shall permit City to examine and copy all books, records and other papers relating to Borrower's use of the Loan funds to insure Borrower's compliance with this Agreement, the Act and applicable provisions of federal, state, and local laws, ordinances, rules and regulations.

 4.5 Compliance with Laws; Notify City of Litigation or Complaints. The Project shall in all respects conform to and comply with all covenants, conditions, restrictions and reservations affecting the Property and with all applicable zoning, environmental protection, use and building codes, laws, regulations and ordinances. Borrower shall comply with all applicable laws and regulations in the development and use of the Property. Borrower shall promptly notify City in writing of all litigation or possible litigation, and of all complaints or charges made by any governmental authority, that affect Borrower, the Project, or the Property.

 4.6 Indemnify City. To the full extent permitted by applicable law, Borrower shall indemnify and hold City, its elected and appointed officials and employees, harmless from all liability for any actual or alleged damage or injury of whatsoever nature arising out of or in any way connected with the Project or the Loan, or arising out of Borrower's breach of the provisions of this Agreement, including the cost of defense thereof using counsel approved by City. Borrower's obligation under this section shall apply notwithstanding any acts, omissions or negligence of the City or its officials, employees or agents, except that if RCW 4.24.115 (or successor provision) shall apply to any claim for any such damage or injury, then to the extent required by such statute, (1) this indemnity shall not apply in case of any liability for damages arising out of bodily injury to persons or damage to property caused or resulting from the sole negligence of the City, its agents or employees, and (2) in case of liability for damages arising out of bodily injury to persons or damage to property caused by or resulting from the concurrent negligence of (a) the City or its agents or employees, and (b) Borrower or its agents or employees, this indemnity shall apply only to the extent of Borrower's negligence. City may commence, appear in or defend any action or proceeding purporting to affect the rights, duties or liabilities of the parties hereto, and subject to the limitation in the preceding sentence Borrower shall pay all of the City's costs and expenses incurred thereby, including reasonable attorneys' fees, on demand. This section shall survive execution, delivery and performance of this Agreement, the Note and the Loan Documents and repayment of the Loan.

 Borrower waives, solely with respect to the City, its immunity under RCW Title 51, Industrial Insurance. Borrower and City acknowledge that this waiver has been specifically negotiated and that City would not enter into this Agreement absent this waiver.

 4.7 Further Actions. Borrower will at any time and from time to time upon request of City take or cause to be taken any action, execute, acknowledge, deliver or record any further documents, opinions, or other instruments as City shall request in order to give effect to the intent of this Agreement, or as the City is required to do or obtain by HUD or other federal, state or county regulatory agency.

 4.8 Reporting. Borrower shall deliver financial reports to OED on a semi-annual basis, in form acceptable to OED, no later than January 31st (covering the preceding six-month period of July through the end of December) and July 31st (covering the preceding six-month period of January through the end of June) of each year. Borrower shall provide, within thirty (30) days after any request from OED, such additional reports or documents as OED shall reasonably require to document compliance with HUD regulations or with City ordinances and policies, including without limitation the cumulative total of all youths served on an unduplicated basis for the period then ended. Within thirty (30) days after the fifth (5th) anniversary of initial occupancy of the Property, Borrower shall submit a final report including the information stated above for the partial calendar year ended on such fifth anniversary and the cumulative totals of all youths served on an unduplicated basis. All reports submitted shall be complete and accurate in all material respects and shall be supported by sufficient documentation, which shall be provided to OED promptly upon request.

 4.9 Use of Property; Conditions on Development; Permitting.

 A. The Property shall be held for the sole purpose of the Project and the operation of the Orion Center as described on Attachment B, and shall not be used for any other purpose, nor sold, transferred, or leased without the express written consent of the City, nor in any manner committed to use other than for the purposes described on Attachment B. Borrower shall encumber Property only for the purpose of financing the development of such Property as contemplated in Attachment B.

 B. To the extent required by applicable laws or regulations, any development, demolition, or other physical change in the Property shall be subject to review and approval under the National Environmental Policy Act and related laws, and to any conditions or mitigation imposed by the City or other authorities thereunder, in addition to all applicable requirements under the State Environmental Policy Act, City Land Use and Building Codes, and other regulations generally applicable to development of real property.

 C. By November 1, 2002, Borrower shall obtain all permits necessary to commence rehabilitation and conversion of the Property to the uses described on Attachment B.

 4.10 Documentation of Costs and Other Financial and Record- keeping Requirements.

All accounting documents pertaining in whole or in part to this Agreement shall be clearly identified and readily accessible, and the City shall have the right to audit the records of the Borrower as they relate to this Agreement, upon reasonable notice. The Borrower also shall:

 1. Maintain an effective system of internal control over and accountability for all funds and property supplied and make sure the same are used solely for authorized purposes.

 2. Keep a continuing record of all disbursements by date, check number, amount, vendor, description of items purchased and line item from which money was expended, as reflected in the Borrower's accounting records. The line item notations must be substantiated by a receipt, invoice marked "Paid," or payroll record.

 3. Maintain payroll and financial records for a period of six (6) years after receipt of the final disbursement under this Agreement.

 4.

 ARTICLE V -- REGULATORY PROVISIONS

 5.1 Federal Regulations. Borrower acknowledges that the Loan is to be made with federal funds received by City under the Community Development Block Grant ("CDBG") program under applicable regulations of the Department of Housing and Urban Development ("HUD"). Accordingly, Borrower agrees, represents and warrants that Borrower has complied with and shall comply with all applicable federal requirements related to the use of CDBG funds, as applicable, including without limitation applicable provisions of 24 CFR Part 5, subpart A, any applicable provisions of the federal act appropriating such funds, and those set forth below:

Borrower represents, warrants and agrees that prior to making an offer for any parcel described on Attachment A: (1) Borrower clearly advised the owner that it lacks the power of eminent domain and therefore is unable to acquire the property in the event negotiations fail to reach an amicable agreement, and (2) Borrower informed the owner of what Borrower believed or believes to be the fair market value of the property. If any such parcel has been in residential use, wholly or in part, then Borrower agrees to comply with the City's Residential Antidisplacement and Relocation Assistance Plan, as the same may be adopted and amended from time to time.

 B. Borrower shall provide to City a complete and accurate list of all occupants of each parcel acquired for the Project as of the date that Borrower obtained site control, and a complete and accurate list of all persons occupying such parcel at any time after site control and through the date of full occupancy after construction or rehabilitation.

If, as a result of any such direct disbursement by the City, the total amount of City funds expended shall exceed the total amount of disbursements for which Borrower is eligible hereunder, then Borrower shall repay such excess to the City on demand.

 E. Borrower shall carry out the terms of any relocation plan submitted to and approved by City, but the terms of any such plan shall not limit Borrower's obligations under this Agreement or applicable laws or regulations, and no such approval by City shall be construed as a waiver or modification of any requirement of this Agreement or applicable laws or regulations.

Unless specified otherwise in this Agreement, Program Income (as defined in 24 C.F.R. Section 570.500(a)) shall be promptly paid to the City. Payments made on the Loan, by or on behalf of Borrower, shall be construed to include any Program Income received prior to each such payment, up to the amount of each such payment. All payments of Program Income shall be applied to any balance owing on the Loan. The obligation of Borrower under this subsection A to pay Program Income to the City shall continue until the Loan is repaid in full, and shall then terminate, except that (i) pursuant to 24 CFR Section 570.503(b)(3), at the end of any year, upon the City's request, Borrower shall remit to the City Program Income balances (including investments of Program Income) held by Borrower, after deducting therefrom amounts necessary for Borrower's immediate cash needs; and (ii) to the extent required by 24 CFR Section 570.504, any Program Income on hand when this Agreement expires or received after such expiration, shall be paid to the City.

Part 84, and in 24 C.F.R. Section 85.36. To the extent required by such circulars and regulations, this Section shall survive expiration of this Agreement.

 If Borrower "expends" $300,000 or more in a year in Federal awards it shall have a single or program-specific audit conducted for that year in accordance with the provisions of OMB Circular A- 133. For purposes of this subsection, the amount of Federal awards that the Borrower expends shall be determined in accordance with Circular A-133 and interpretations thereof by the federal Office of Management and Budget. A program-specific audit may be conducted only if Borrower is eligible for such an audit in lieu of a single audit under Circular A-133. The Borrower shall timely and properly prepare all statements and schedules required by Circular A-133. The audit shall be conducted in conformity with Generally Accepted Government Auditing Standards ("GAGAS").

 If Borrower "expends" less than $300,000 in federal funds in any year it is exempt from audit requirements under this Section for that year, but records must be available for review or audit by appropriate officials as provided in Circular A-133 or by State law or City ordinance.

 Except as expressly provided in the attached Budget, compliance with this Section shall be at the sole expense of the Borrower. Notwithstanding any allowance in the attached Budget, no audit costs shall be allowable costs if audits required by Circular A-133 have not been made or have been made but not in accordance with Circular A-133. No audit costs shall be allowable for audits not required under Circular A-133, except as expressly provided in Circular A-133. In cases of failure to have a proper audit conducted in accordance with Circular A-133, failure to provide a timely audit report, or failure to take timely corrective action to resolve any findings, Borrower will be subject to appropriate sanction.

 Audits shall be done annually. Audits shall be completed within six (6) months of the end of Borrower's fiscal year.

 The Borrower shall comply with all auditee responsibilities under Circular A-133.

 The auditor shall be selected consistent with Circular A-133. Use of small audit firms and audit firms owned and controlled by socially and economically disadvantaged individuals is encouraged.

 F. Suspension and Termination. Suspension or termination of this Agreement may occur in the event of Borrower's failure to comply with a material term of the Loan Documents and, in accordance with 24 C.F.R. Section 85.44, the Loan may be terminated for convenience.

 G. "Expiration". For purposes of this Section, "expiration" of this Agreement shall be the later of the date when the Loan is repaid in full or the date when Borrower has completed the Project and commenced operations at the Property as contemplated by this Agreement. Notwithstanding such expiration, the provisions of this Agreement not then fully performed shall remain in full force and effect, and, in any event, this Agreement shall remain in effect during any period when the Borrower has control of any CDBG funds, including Program Income.

 (a) Upon the occurrence of an Event of Default, City may, in addition to any other remedies which City may have hereunder or under the Loan Documents or by law, at its option and without prior demand or notice take any or all of the following actions:

 (1) Immediately terminate any further advance of Loan funds hereunder.

 (2) Declare the Note immediately due and payable.

 (3) Draw against the Letter of Credit up to the full amount owing on the Note, and apply the proceeds to the balance owing thereunder, whether or not then due and payable.

All of the City's rights and remedies in the Loan Documents are cumulative and shall be in addition to all other rights and remedies provided by law, and in addition to all rights and remedies of the City under any other agreements. The exercise of any right or remedy by City hereunder shall not in any way constitute a cure or waiver of default hereunder or under any other Loan Document or invalidate any act done pursuant to any notice of default, or prejudice City in the exercise of any of its rights hereunder or under any other documents. To the full extent permitted by applicable law, the Borrower hereby irrevocably waives the protection of any provision for an automatic stay under the United States Bankruptcy Code.

 ARTICLE VII -- MISCELLANEOUS

 7.1 No Waiver. No waiver of any default or breach by Borrower hereunder shall be implied from any failure by City to take action on account of such default if such default persists or is repeated, and no express waiver shall affect any default other than the default specified in the waiver and shall be operative only for the time and to the extent therein stated. Waivers of any covenants, term or condition contained herein shall not be construed as a waiver of any subsequent breach of the same covenant, term or condition. The consent or approval by City to, or approval of, any act by Borrower requiring consent or approval shall not be deemed to waive or render unnecessary the consent or approval to, or of, any subsequent similar act.

 7.2 Successors and Assigns; Assignment. This Agreement is made and entered into for the sole protection and benefit of the City, Borrower, and their respective successors and assigns, and no other person or persons shall have any right of action hereunder, except to the extent that specific provisions grant rights to the State or federal governments. The terms hereof shall inure to the benefit of the successors and assigns of the parties hereto; provided, however, that the Borrower's interest hereunder cannot be assigned or otherwise transferred without the prior written consent of City, in its sole discretion.

 7.3 Notices. Any notice, demand or request required hereunder shall be given in writing at the addresses set forth below by personal delivery, facsimile transmission, or first class mail.

 7.9 Governing Law; Construction. This Agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of Washington, and The City of Seattle, except to the extent federal law applies. This Agreement is the product of negotiation and shall not be construed strictly against the party responsible for drafting this Agreement. Borrower agrees that because the City is not a commercial lender and is providing the Loan, subject to federal regulations, as a temporary use of funds allocated to other CDBG-eligible activities, the City shall not be subject to any standard of commercial reasonableness as to the administration of the Loan, any consents or approvals hereunder, or the enforcement of the Loan Documents.

 7.10 Survival. All agreements, representations and warranties made herein and in the Note shall survive the execution and delivery of this Agreement and of the Loan Documents and the making of the Loan hereunder and continue in full force and effect until the obligations of Borrower hereunder and the indebtedness evidenced by the Note have been fully and finally paid and satisfied, regardless of whether the Note is surrendered or marked as canceled or paid in full. In addition, the obligations of Borrower with respect to the development and completion of the Project, the use of the Property for the purposes required hereunder for the period specified in Section 5.1(e), reports to the City, recordkeeping, and federal requirements, shall survive the repayment of the Loan and remain in full force and effect, and other provisions shall survive repayment of the Loan to the extent provided in the Loan Documents.

 7.11 Venue and Forum. In the event that any legal action should be filed by either party against the other, the venue and forum for such action shall be the Superior Court of the State of Washington for the County of King.

 7.12 Attorney's Fees. In the event either party shall bring an action to enforce the terms and conditions of this Agreement, or if there shall be any legal proceedings involving this Agreement (including without limitation any bankruptcy proceedings), the prevailing party shall be entitled to recover all of its costs and expenses, including, but not limited to, reasonable attorney's fees as determined by the court. "Reasonable attorney's fees" shall include the reasonable value of the services of in-house counsel.

 7.13 Effect of Consents and Approvals; Borrower's Obligations Absolute. Any approval granted by the City for purposes of this Agreement shall not constitute, nor waive the requirement for, any other approval that may be required under any other agreement, law, ordinance, or regulation, nor may any such approval be relied upon by any person for any purpose other than compliance with this Agreement. Borrower acknowledges that its plans for the Project are subject to various processes, reviews, and permits, and that the feasibility and cost of the Project may be substantially affected by actions of various City departments, including without limitation determinations on land use and environmental matters (and the timing thereof). Borrower understands and agrees that neither this Agreement nor any authorization or approval of the Loan by the Mayor or City Council constitutes any assurance as to the consistency of the Project with any regulatory requirements or as to the timing or substance of any actions, approvals, or permits desired or required by Borrower for the Project, or any conditions that may be imposed thereon. Borrower irrevocably agrees that its payment obligations under the Loan Documents are absolute and unconditional, and that no action or omission of the City with respect to any of the matters described in this Section, even if untimely or contrary to law, shall in any way give rise to any defense to, or grounds for equitable relief from the strict enforcement of, such obligations. Borrower further irrevocably agrees that no claim, defense, or counterclaim of any nature shall be grounds for any injunction or order restraining the City from drawing upon the Letter of Credit or restraining the Bank from honoring any draw on the Letter of Credit, and that if Borrower shall have any claim or counterclaim concerning any drawing on the Letter of Credit it shall be an adequate remedy for the Borrower to pursue an action at law against the City.

 7.14 Duplicate Originals. This Agreement may be executed in duplicate, and if so executed, each of the parties hereto shall receive an original, and each original shall constitute one and the same agreement.

 IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the City and the Borrower have executed this Agreement as of the date first written above by and through their duly authorized representatives.

 PROMISSORY NOTE

 YOUTHCARE - ORION CENTER PROJECT

 CDBG FLOAT LOAN

 $3,100,000.00 ______________, 2002

 Seattle, Washington

 1. FOR VALUE RECEIVED, the undersigned, YOUTHCARE, a Washington nonprofit corporation ("Borrower"), promises to pay to the order of The City of Seattle, a Washington municipal corporation ("City"), at its Office of Economic Development, 700 Fifth Avenue, Suite 1730, Seattle, Washington 98104, or such other place as the holder of this Note may from time to time designate, the amount of all advances ("Advances") made by City pursuant to the terms of the Community Development Block Grant Float Loan Agreement between the Borrower and City dated ________________, 2002, as the same may be amended (the "Loan Agreement"), plus interest as provided below. The unpaid principal balance of this Note at any time shall be equal to the aggregate amount of all Advances then made less the aggregate amount of all payments received by the holder of this Note and applied to principal hereunder. The unpaid principal balance of the loan evidenced hereby (the "Loan") shall not at any time exceed the sum of THREE MILLION ONE HUNDRED THOUSAND AND NO/100 DOLLARS ($3,100,000). Capitalized terms not defined herein shall have the meanings set forth in the Loan Agreement unless the context otherwise clearly requires. Disbursement of the Loan evidenced by this Note is to be made subject to the terms and conditions of the Loan Agreement.

 2. Interest. Borrower agrees to pay interest from the date funds are advanced at a rate of two percent (2%) per annum, computed on the outstanding principal balance as it exists from time to time. Borrower is not required to make monthly payments of interest but shall be required to pay all interest accrued on the date when all outstanding principal becomes due, or earlier pursuant to Section 5 below.

 3. Maturity; Demand Feature. The principal balance of this Note, together with all accrued and unpaid interest, shall be due and payable in full on the earliest of (i) ten (10) calendar days after demand by the holder hereof under Section 5 below, or (ii) the date ("Maturity Date") thirty (30) months after the date of this Note, or (iii) sixty (60) days prior to the expiration date of the Letter of Credit (as defined below). Borrower acknowledges that demands for payment may be made by the holder of this Note at any time for any reason.

 4. Letter of Credit. This Note shall be secured by an unconditional, irrevocable letter of credit (the "Letter of Credit"), payable upon demand, issued by a banking institution mutually agreeable to Borrower and the holder of this Note, all as more fully set forth in the Loan Agreement.

 5. Demands for Full or Partial Payment. The holder of this Note has the absolute right to make demand for full or partial repayment of principal and accrued interest at any time for any reason regardless of Borrower's full compliance with all terms of the Loan Documents. The holder shall make such demand in writing, by hand delivery, mailing or facsimile transmission in the manner set forth in the Loan Agreement. Payments pursuant to a demand under this Section shall be due and payable on or before ten (10) calendar days from the date the demand is effective under the notice provisions of the Loan Agreement. If the holder of this Note so specifies in the demand or other written communication, payment shall be made by a draw against the Letter of Credit, and the holder shall have the right to submit such draw at any time on or after on the tenth calendar day after such demand is effective. The requirements for demand and the notice period under this Section shall not apply in case of acceleration pursuant to any other provision of this Note or the Loan Agreement.

 6. Application of Payments. Payments under this Note shall be applied first to any costs or fees owing hereunder or under the Loan Agreement, next to accrued interest, and finally to the reduction of principal.

 7. Prepayment. Provided that Borrower shall first give the holder of this Note thirty (30) calendar days' prior notice, the indebtedness evidenced hereby may be prepaid in whole or in part from time to time without premium or penalty. If so elected by the holder of this Note, any such prepayment shall be made by draw against the Letter of Credit.

 8. Default and Acceleration. Should default be made in any payment when due or in the performance or observance of any of the covenants and agreements of this Note, or if there shall be an Event of Default under the Loan Agreement, the whole sum of principal and interest shall become immediately due and payable at the option of the holder without notice, and the holder shall have the right immediately to draw on the Letter of Credit. Failure to exercise the option to accelerate shall not constitute a waiver of the right to exercise it in the event of a continuing or subsequent default.

 9. Interest on Past Due Amounts. Whether or not the entire balance is accelerated, all amounts of principal and interest past due shall bear interest at the rate of twelve percent (12%) per annum from and after the due date.

 10. Sale of Property. Upon the sale, transfer or assignment, whether voluntary, involuntary or by operation of law, of all or substantially all of Borrower's interest in the Property (as such term is defined in the Loan Agreement), at its sole option the holder hereof may, by written notice to Borrower, declare all sums then outstanding hereunder to be immediately due and payable.

 11. Unconditional Obligations. The obligations of the Borrower under this Note are absolute, unconditional and irrevocable. All payments required hereunder shall be made without any setoff, counterclaim, deduction or withholding whatsoever.

 12. Waivers. Except for the demands described in Section 5 above, Borrower hereby waives diligence, demand, presentment for payment, and notice of whatever kind or nature. Without discharging or in any way affecting the liability of Borrower or any other person who may become liable on this Note, Borrower hereby consents to any and all extensions of this Note as the holder hereof may in its sole discretion grant from time to time, to the release of all or any part of the security for the payment hereof and to the release of any party liable for repayment of the obligations hereunder.

 13. Manner of Payment. All payments due on this Note shall be payable in lawful money of the United States of America at the time of payment. Unless otherwise provided in the Loan Agreement or requested by the holder of this Note, all payments of interest and principal hereunder to the holder shall be made by drawing on the Letter of Credit. If the issuer of the Letter of Credit fails to honor any draw by the holder of this Note in full or in part, or if the amount remaining on the Letter of Credit is insufficient to pay the amount due on the Note, or in the event that the holder of this Note is required by any law or court order to refund or otherwise relinquish any portion of any amount received from any draw on the Letter of Credit, then Borrower shall pay the full balance due immediately on demand. Any such payment shall be in immediately available funds, and shall be made to the holder at the address first hereinabove indicated, or such other address as the holder may hereafter designate.

 14. Governing Law. This Note shall be governed by the laws of the State of Washington, except to the extent that Federal laws or regulations may preempt the laws of the State of Washington.

 15. Costs and Attorney's Fees. In the event that this Note is placed in the hands of an attorney at law for collection after maturity or upon default, or in the event that proceedings at law or in equity are instituted in connection herewith, Borrower shall pay all costs of collecting or attempting to collect this Note and all costs incurred by the holder in any such proceedings, including, without limitation, reasonable attorney's fees (including costs and fees incurred in any bankruptcy, appellate, or arbitration proceeding); and all such amounts shall be secured by the Letter of Credit. "Reasonable attorney's fees" shall include the reasonable value of services of in- house counsel.

 16. No Usury. This Note and the Loan Agreement are subject to the limitation that in no event shall interest or any other amount paid or agreed to be paid for the use, forbearance or detention of money to be advanced hereunder or pursuant to the Loan Agreement exceed the highest lawful rate permissible under applicable usury laws, if any. If fulfillment of any provision hereof or of the Loan Agreement shall be deemed by a court of competent and final jurisdiction to violate any applicable usury restrictions, then ipso facto, the obligation to be fulfilled shall be reduced to such highest lawful rate, and any amount received in excess of such limit shall be applied to reduce the unpaid principal balance hereof and not to the payment of interest.

 17. Time. Time is of the essence of this Note and of each and every provision hereof.

 18. Purpose. Borrower represents and warrants that this Note is made, and the proceeds hereof are to be used, solely for business and commercial purposes, and not for personal, consumer, household or family purposes.

 NOTICE: ORAL AGREEMENTS OR ORAL COMMITMENTS TO LOAN MONEY, EXTEND CREDIT, TO FORBEAR FROM ENFORCING REPAYMENT OF A DEBT, ARE NOT ENFORCEABLE UNDER WASHINGTON LAW.

 IN WITNESS WHEREOF, Borrower has executed this Promissory Note as of the date first above written.
