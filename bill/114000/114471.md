 ORDINANCE _________________

 AN ORDINANCE relating to the Department of Parks and Recreation; directing issuance of a supplemental Gift Catalogue pursuant to Subsection 5.78.010 B of the Seattle Municipal Code containing the Department of Parks and Recreation programs designated in this ordinance, and removing from the City's Gift Catalogue the Department of Parks and Recreation programs now contained in it.

 WHEREAS, private citizens, non-profit organizations and corporations have a history of giving generously; and

 WHEREAS, the City of Seattle Gift Catalogue adopted under Ordinance 112137 provides a means for identifying and publicizing public giving to various City Departments, including Parks and Recreation; and

 WHEREAS, the Department of Parks and Recreation's needs and programs have changed dramatically since the City's Gift Catalogue was last issued, and the existing Catalogue does not reflect either present-day giving options, current Department of Parks and Recreation programs, or the costs of those programs; and

 WHEREAS, citizens and organizations need clear and realistic information concerning park programs and the costs of those programs in order to make informed decisions about park related gifts; and

 WHEREAS, the Department wishes to update the Gift Catalogue to keep abreast of the philanthropic environment and current park programs in order to facilitate receipt of gifts and donations from a broad spectrum of citizens and organizations; and

 WHEREAS, retaining existing Parks and Recreation programs in the Gift Catalogue is confusing to the public; NOW, THEREFORE,

 BE IT ORDAINED BY THE CITY OF SEATTLE AS FOLLOWS:

 Section 1. Pursuant to Subsection 5.78.010 B of the Seattle Municipal Code, the City shall issue a supplemental Gift Catalogue that shall include the following Department of Parks and Recreation programs:

 1. Park Maintenance;

 2. Park Capital Improvements; and

 3. Park Special Programs, including but not limited to horticulture, environmental stewardship, and recreation.

 The programs administered by the Department of Parks and Recreation contained in the City's Gift Catalogue are removed as of the date the supplement is issued, and are replaced by the foregoing programs. Removal of programs from the Gift Catalogue is not intended to preclude donations for those purposes in accordance with Chapter 5.78 of the Seattle Municipal Code to the extent that the programs are subsumed in the programs that replace them. For example, donations for swim lessons are subsumed in Park Special Programs: recreation.

 Section 2. To further the intent in Section 1 above, the Superintendent of Parks and Recreation is authorized to solicit gifts and donations from the public for the Department of Parks and Recreation programs in the City's Gift Catalogue. In doing so, the Superintendent may employ means other than the City's Gift Catalogue, such as publishing information on the programs in brochures, or other formats, and engaging in special marketing and promotional activities, from time to time and as appropriate to further donations to the park programs in the City's Gift Catalogue.

 Section 3. Any act consistent with the authority and prior to the effective date of this ordinance is hereby ratified and confirmed.

 Section 4. This ordinance shall take effect and be in force thirty (30) days from and after its approval by the Mayor, but if not approved and returned by the Mayor within ten (10) days after presentation, it shall take effect as provided by Municipal Code Section 1.04.020.

 Passed by the City Council the ____ day of _________, 2003, and signed by me in open session in authentication of its passage this _____ day of __________, 2003.
