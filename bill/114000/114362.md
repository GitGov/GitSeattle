 AN ORDINANCE relating to the Health Care Subfund of the General Fund; amending Seattle Municipal Code Section 4.50.020.

 WHEREAS, on November 22, 1999, the City Council passed Ordinance 119762, which amended prior ordinance language relating to the Health Care Subfund of the General Fund; and

 WHEREAS, on August 20, 2001, the City Council passed Ordinance 120489, further clarifying uses of the Health Care Subfund; and

 WHEREAS, on November 13, 2001, the City Council passed Ordinance 120626, amending the Health Care Subfund language in Ordinance 119762 and codifying this language in a new Section 4.50.020 of the Seattle Municipal Code; and

 WHEREAS, on July 22, 2002, the City Council passed Ordinance 120861, further clarifying the language in Section 4.50.020 of the Seattle Municipal Code; and

 WHEREAS, for certain of its health care plans, the City is self- insured; and

 WHEREAS, State of Washington self-insurance regulations for local government self-insured medical care programs require financial solvency, and the City determined that a Subfund Reserve best satisfies that requirement; and

 WHEREAS, the Seattle Municipal Code currently sets a Subfund Reserve at two months and ten days of projected health care claims and non- City administrative costs under the self-insured plans; and

 WHEREAS, higher-than-anticipated claims costs in 2001 have resulted in a shortfall in this Reserve; and

 WHEREAS, the City expects that 2002 claims will also be higher than anticipated, resulting in an additional shortfall to the Reserve; and

 WHEREAS, the City expects to recover the 2001 and 2002 shortfalls through higher health care rates in 2003 and 2004, but does not expect to meet the required two months and ten day Reserve in the 2003-2004 biennium; and

 WHEREAS, the City plans to set health care rates in 2005-2006 at sufficient levels to meet the Reserve; NOW THEREFORE,

 BE IT ORDAINED BY THE CITY OF SEATTLE AS FOLLOWS:
