 AMENDMENT NO. 1

 To

 INTERLOCAL COOPERATION AGREEMENT

 For

 EMERGENCY RADIO COMMUNICATION SYSTEM

 Effective this _____ day of __________ 2003, the Interlocal Cooperation Agreement for the Emergency Radio Communication System is hereby amended as follows:

 Article II,

 The definition of "Regional Customer(s)" is added to Article II, as follows:

 "Regional Customer(s) means users of the system that are determined by the Board to be of unique enough character so as to not appropriately gain system access through an individual Sub-region. Regional Customers will be characterized as Secondary Users as defined in Paragraph 2.23. The Board will establish the access fee to be charged to Regional Customers and will establish administrative and fiscal procedures to allow collection of that fee into the operational fund used to support the commonly owned equipment."

 Article VII

 Paragraph 7.5 is hereby amended by adding the term "Regional Customer(s)" as follows:

 7.5 The Board shall be responsible for approval of the terms and conditions of access of Secondary Users or Regional Customer(s) to the System if such approval is required as a condition of contract or agreement between a Secondary User or Regional Customer(s) and a Subregion as provided in Section 9.14; Provided, that any Secondary User or Regional Customer(s) that is added to the System after approval of the initial System design which contributes its licensed 800 MHz frequencies to the System shall have the right to remove such frequencies from the System upon removal from the System.

 Except as provided herein, all terms and conditions of the Interlocal Cooperation Agreement for the Emergency Radio Communication System as heretofore changed, remain unchanged and in full force and effect.
