 WHEREAS, Ordinance 121283, adopted by the City Council on September 22, 2003, and Ordinance 121418 adopted by the City Council on March 15, 2004 appropriated funding from Urban Area Security Initiative (UASI) Grant Programs I and II to the Police Department, Fire Department, Seattle Public Utilities, Department of Transportation, Seattle City Light, Department of Information Technology, Department of Planning & Development, and the Fleets & Facilities Department for purposes of conducting vulnerability assessments, developing a homeland security strategy that was specific to the needs of the City, and addressing the City's specific equipment, training, planning, and exercise needs; and
