 AN ORDINANCE relating to land use and zoning; amending Seattle Municipal Code Sections 23.47.016, 23.54.015, 23.84.030 and 23.84.032 and adding new sections 23.47.039, 23.49.028 and 23.50.049 to establish regulations relating to the keeping of animals in pet daycare centers in commercial, industrial and downtown zones and the keeping of animals generally in the downtown zones.

 WHEREAS the City of Seattle currently has land use regulations for the keeping of animals, and other animal-related uses, including animal shelters and kennels, and pet grooming; and

 WHEREAS the pet population is growing and busy households increasingly need services that provide care for these pets; and

 WHEREAS businesses are responding to this need for pet daycare centers, which are not clearly regulated by the Land Use Code; NOW THEREFORE,

 BE IT ORDAINED BY THE CITY OF SEATTLE AS FOLLOWS:

 Section 1. Subsection D of Section 23.47.016 of the Seattle Municipal Code, which section was last amended by Ordinance 121477, is amended as follows:

 23.47.016 Landscaping and screening for specific uses.

 ***

 D. Screening and Landscaping Requirements for Specific Uses.

 1. Surface Parking Areas.

 a. When a surface parking area abuts a lot in a residential zone, six (6) foot high screening along the abutting lot line(s) shall be required. A five (5) foot deep landscaped area shall be required inside the screening (Exhibit 23.47.016 A).

 b. When a surface parking area is across an alley from a lot in a residential zone, six (6) foot high screening along the alley shall be required. A five (5) foot deep landscaped area shall be required inside the screening. The Director may reduce or waive the screening and landscaping requirement for part or all of the lot abutting the alley, or may waive only the landscaping requirement, when required parking can only be provided at the rear lot line and the alley is necessary to provide aisle space. In making the determination to waive or reduce the landscaping and screening requirements, the Director shall consider the following criteria:

 (1) Whether the lot width and depth permit a workable plan for the building and parking which would preserve the screening and landscaping; and

 (2) Whether the character of use across the alley, such as multifamily parking structures, makes the screening and landscaping less necessary; and

 (3) Whether the property is located in a pedestrian-designated zone and therefore access to parking from the street is not feasible or is undesirable; and

 (4) Whether a topographic break between the alley and the residential zone makes screening less necessary.

 c. Surface parking areas for nineteen (19) or fewer cars shall be screened by three (3) foot high screening along the street lot line.

 d. Surface parking areas for more than nineteen (19) cars shall provide three (3) foot high view-obscuring landscaping along street lot lines, and landscaping according to subsection A4 of this section. The Director may reduce or waive this requirement for reasons of safety, to assure adequate maneuvering room for service vehicles, or to prevent the number of parking spaces from being reduced to less than the required amount.

 2. Parking Within or Under Structures.

 a. When parking occupies any portion of the street- level frontage of a structure between a height of five (5) feet and eight (8) feet above sidewalk grade, the portion of the structure containing the parking shall be required to have a five (5) foot deep landscaped area along street lot lines. In addition, the parking shall be screened by:

 (1) The facade of the structure; or

 (2) Six (6) foot high screening between the structure and the landscaped area (Exhibit 23.47.016 B).

 b. A five (5) foot setback shall be required along all property lines abutting residentially zoned lots for any portion of a structure which contains parking that is not screened from the residential zone by the exterior wall of the structure. At ground level, the setback shall be landscaped according to subsection 23.47.016 C3 and six (6) foot high screening along the abutting property line(s) shall be provided. Above ground level, parking that is required to provide a five (5) foot setback shall have an opaque screen at least three and one-half (3 1/2) feet high.

 c. When access is through a street-facing facade, the facade shall contain one (1) garage door, not to exceed the maximum width allowed for the curbcut.

 d. The perimeter of each floor of parking which is eight (8) feet or more above sidewalk grade shall have an opaque screen at least three and one-half (3 1/2) feet high.

 3. Drive-in Business.

 a. Drive-in businesses, including gas stations, abutting or across an alley from a residentially zoned lot, shall provide six (6) foot high screening along the abutting or alley lot lines. A five (5) foot deep landscaped area inside the screening shall be required when the drive-in portion of the business or its queuing lanes abut a lot in a residential zone.

 b. Drive-in businesses other than gas stations in which the drive-in portion of the business or its queuing lanes is across the street from a residentially zoned lot shall provide three (3) foot high screening for the drive-in portion.

 c. Gas stations shall provide three (3) foot high screening along street lot lines in all NC1, NC2 and NC3 zones. In C1 and C2 zones, three (3) foot high screening shall only be required when a gas station is across the street from a residentially zoned lot.

 4. Outdoor Sales and Outdoor Display of Rental Equipment.

 a. When an outdoor sales area or outdoor display of rental equipment area is abutting or across an alley from a residentially zoned lot, six (6) foot high screening shall be provided along the abutting or alley lot lines.

 b. When an outdoor sales area or outdoor display of rental equipment is across the street from a residentially zoned lot, three (3) foot high screening along the street lot line shall be provided.

 5. Outdoor Storage.

 a. C1 Zones. Outdoor storage shall be screened by a structure's facade or by six (6) foot high screening between the storage area and all property lines. A five (5) foot deep landscaped area shall be provided between all street lot lines and the six (6) foot high screening (Exhibit 23.47.016 C).

 b. C2 Zones.

 (1) When an outdoor storage area is across the street from a residentially zoned lot it shall be screened from the street by the facade of a structure, or by six (6) foot high screening along the street lot lines.

 (2) When a lot containing outdoor storage abuts a residentially zoned lot, the outdoor storage area shall set back fifty (50) feet from abutting residentially zoned lot lines and be screened by a structure's facade or by six (6) foot high screening between the outdoor storage and all abutting property lines (Exhibit 23.47.016 D).

 c. Outdoor Dry Storage of Boats. Screening shall be required for the outdoor dry storage of boats in the Shoreline District according to the provisions for outdoor storage in C1 zones, subsection D5a, unless the dry storage of boats is located in a C2 zone, in which case screening shall be required according to the provisions for outdoor storage in C2 zones, subsection D5b.

 6. Mobile Home Parks. Mobile home parks shall be screened by six (6) foot high screening along all non-street lot lines. A five (5) foot deep landscaped area shall be provided along all street lot lines of a mobile home park. A five (5) foot planting strip with street trees may be provided instead of the five (5) foot deep landscaped area.

 7. Pet daycare centers. Outdoor areas associated with a pet daycare center must be screened from all property lines by the facade of the structure or by six (6) foot high screening between the outdoor area and all property lines.  8.

 Lots Within the Shoreline District. On lots within the Shoreline District where view corridors are required, the height of screening may be reduced and the location and type of required landscaping may be modified so that view corridors are not obstructed.

~~8~~9. When one (1) of the specific uses listed in this subsection is proposed for expansion, the applicable ~~landsca4ping~~landscaping requirement shall be met. The Director may reduce or waive the landscaping requirements where physically infeasible due to the location of existing structures or required parking.
