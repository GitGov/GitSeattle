Members may be discharged from further service by three (3) consecutive unexcused absences and for other cause. Members shall serve without pay, but may be reimbursed for their expenses while attending meetings.

 The Rates Advisory Committee may adopt rules for its own procedures, including quorum requirements and the frequency of meetings. Meetings of the Rates Advisory Committee will be open to the public, unless, had the Rates Advisory Committee been subject to Chapter 42.30 RCW, that law would not have required that the meeting or portion of the meeting be open to the public.
