 This project improves access and mobility for pedestrians, transit, bicyclists, freight and vehicles. Street improvements focus on pedestrian safety. Planting strips and street trees between the sidewalk and the roadway are added by relocating the curb and gutter. Curb bulbs are installed at key pedestrian crossings. Minor improvements to the existing drainage system are necessary to collect stormwater in the new curb line. Other street improvements include widening the existing sidewalk, repairing pavement base and repairing existing bus layover areas. Pedestrian lighting is installed to further increase safety and meet illumination standards. ~~This project is fully funded by Sound~~~~Transit.~~ The improvements to S Henderson St. will connect the Henderson St. light rail station with the Rainier Beach commercial area. In 2006, SDOT received an additional $485,447 in federal funding to supplement the Sound Transit contribution.

Section 27. The description of the South Lake Union Armory Roof Repair and Seismic Upgrades #K732224 Project in the 2006-2011 Adopted Capital Improvement Program for the Department of Parks and Recreation is amended as follows:

 This project funds a building structural systems analysis to determine a phased building upgrade approach and also assesses and makes improvements to the Armory Building roofing system. The building assessment includes related building systems such as HVAC, piping, electrical, and other mechanical elements. It also includes an assessment of the accessibility requirements of the building such as a stairlift, elevator, ADA compliant restrooms, and building entry. The single-ply membrane roof is replaced and repaired to patch leaks and prevent deterioration of the building structure. The useful life expectancy of the roof after repair is more than 15 years.

 In 2005, the Department of Planning and Development (DPD) notified the Parks Department that additional work would be required to allow for continued occupancy of the building. ~~An additional $500,000 is added to the project to pay for seismic renovation work, as required by code. DPD has also indicated that there are other code required work elements, which are not part of the current project, that must be done to obtain a permanent Occupancy Permit. DPR will seek additional funding for these in the future.~~In the 2006 budget process, $500,000 of Real Estate Excise Tax I revenue was added to pay for seismic renovation work and other code requirements. In addition, in November 2005, the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) awarded the City a $534,922 grant for seismic upgrades. The FEMA funds are appropriated through the first quarter 2006 supplemental budget legislation and require a 25% match of local funds. The Department will use already appropriated REET funds to provide the local match. The operations and maintenance costs associated with this project will be dependent on the code requirements and the final scope of the project.

 Section 28. In accordance with RCW 35.32A.060, some of the foregoing appropriations are made to meet actual necessary expenditures of the City for which insufficient appropriations have been made due to causes that could not reasonably have been foreseen at the time of the making of the 2006 Budget.

 Section 29. The several provisions of this ordinance are declared to be separate and severable and the invalidity of any clause, sentence, paragraph, subdivision, section, or portion of this ordinance, or the invalidity of the application thereof to any person or circumstance, shall not affect the validity of the remainder of this ordinance or the validity of its application to other persons or circumstances.

 Section 30. Any acts consistent with the authority and prior to the effective date of this ordinance are hereby ratified and confirmed.

 Section 31. This ordinance shall take effect and be in force thirty (30) days from and after its approval by the Mayor, but if not approved and returned by the Mayor within ten (10) days after presentation, it shall take effect as provided by Municipal Code Section 1.04.020.

 Central Library Third Floor Project

 BCL/Program Name: Libraries for All BCL/Program Code: B2CFLR3

 Project Type: Improved Facility Start Date: Q1/2006

 Project ID: TC366680 End Date: Q4/2006

 Location: 1000 4th Avenue

 Neighborhood Plan: Commercial Core Neighborhood Plan Matrix: N/A

 Neighborhood District: Downtown

 This project provides for the refinishing of the Worthwood floor on Level 3 of the Central Library, a commitment that was made at the time of the Central Library Project settlement. The 20,000-square- foot floor was installed with a white colored water-based finish that failed to create a seal across the floor. The project includes repair of a portion of the floor that was water-damaged by a leaking coffee cart and is covered by insurance. The Library is also using this opportunity to improve the layout and visibility of the Fiction collection, as well as to relocate the FriendShop and coffee cart to new locations on Level 3. These additional improvements will be paid for with private funds.

 A drainage improvement study has been completed for the Densmore drainage basin. This project evaluates potential impacts from the proposed drainage improvements on water quality in the basin (which includes Green Lake). The project also identifies and evaluates both structural and non-structural options to improve stormwater quality in the basin and mitigate impacts on Green Lake. This project supports the Mayor's Restore Our Waters Strategy to improve Seattle's aquatic environments.

 Location: Densmore Drainage Basin Neighborhood District: Lake Union

 Neighborhood Plan: Not in a Neighborhood Plan Urban Village: Not in an Urban Village

 The project relocates watermains in conjunction with construction of Combined Sewer Overflow (CSO) facilities near South Lake Union. The City and King County are constructing CSO improvements at E. Denny Way and Lake Union in order to meet federal and state requirements for control of combined sewer discharges into Lake Union and Elliott Bay. Watermains are being relocated due to location and construction conflicts. This project was substantially complete in 2005, but remaining betterment and close-out costs of approximately $50,000 will be paid in 2006. The project has been approved by SPU's Asset Management Committee.

 Cedar Falls - Railroad Hazardous Material Remediation

 BCL/Program Name: Water Quality BCL/Program C140B

 Project Type: Rehabilitation or Restoration Start Date: 2nd Quarter 2001

 Project ID: C100078 End Date: 4th Quarter 2006

 Location: Cedar Falls Neighborhood District: Not in a Neighborhood District

 Neighborhood Plan: Not in a Neighborhood Plan Urban Village: Not in an Urban Village

 This project addresses contamination left by historical railroad operations in the Cedar River Municipal Watershed. It has three components: 1) assess the nature and risks posed by the contamination; 2) determine the scope and cost of an appropriate cleanup; and 3) support negotiations with Burlington Northern Santa Fe (BNSF) that lead to remedial action. The first two of these components have been completed. A small portion of the contaminated material is located on lands where BNSF and its predecessor operated under an easement granted by the City, while the majority of the contaminated material is located on land that BNSF owns. The project funds staff time to negotiate an agreement to share a portion of the cleanup costs, and is consistent with SPU's long-term effort to consolidate ownership of watershed lands, after proper cleanup by the responsible parties of any contamination. This project was expected to be completed in 2005, but the analysis of clean-up options took longer than anticipated. The confidence level of the cost estimate is medium. The project has not been approved by SPU's Asset Management Committee.

 Location: 40th Avenue Northeast to 41st Avenue Northeast

 Neighborhood Plan: Not in a Neighborhood Plan Neighborhood Plan Matrix: N/A

 Neighborhood District: Northeast Urban Village: University Campus

 This project constructs a curb and five foot concrete walk on the northwest side of Sand Point Way NE from 40th Ave NE to 41st Ave NE. The improvement includes wheelchair ramps, and drainage and detention as needed. This is a critical missing gap in a sidewalk system that is used by pedestrians traveling back and forth from Children's Hospital to the Ronald MacDonald House. This project is partially funded by a $128,163 grant from the State Transportation Improvement Board.
