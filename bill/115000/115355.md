 ARTICLE 80

 Application and Enforcement of this Code

 I. Application of the Seattle Electrical Code

 80.1 Title. This code shall be known as the "Seattle Electrical Code Supplement" or "Seattle Electrical Code" and may be so cited. It is referred to herein as the "Electrical Code" or "this code."

 80.2 Purpose.

 (A) Protection from Hazards. The purpose of this code is to promote public safety in a practical manner from hazards arising from the use of electricity. This code is intended to provide for and promote the health, safety and welfare of the general public, and not to create or otherwise establish or designate any particular class or group of persons who will or should be especially protected or benefited by the terms of this code. This code is not intended as a design specification nor an instruction manual for untrained persons.

 (B) Chapter 296-46B Washington Administrative Code. An additional purpose of this code is to provide equal, higher or better standards of construction and/or equal, higher or better standards of materials, devices, appliances and equipment than that required by the State of Washington under the provisions of Chapter 19.28 RCW (Revised Code of Washington). Those sections of the Washington State Electrical Code amending the National Electric Code, as set forth at Chapter 296-46B of the Washington Administrative Code (WAC), are adopted except those sections that are amended by or are in conflict with this code. The following administrative sections of Chapter 296-46B WAC are superseded by this code: WAC 296-46B-010 (1) - (13), (15), (16), (19), (20), (23), (24); WAC 296-46B-030; and WAC 296-46B- 110 030 (6)-(13).

 80.3 Scope. The Electrical Code shall apply to all electrical wiring and equipment, including communications systems, installed or used within the City.

 Exception No. 1: Installations in ships and watercraft not connected to public utilities, railway rolling stock, aircraft or automotive vehicles.

 Exception No. 2: Installations of railways or generation, transformation, transmission or distribution of power used exclusively for operation of rolling stock or installations used exclusively for signaling and communication purposes.

 Exception No. 3: Installations of communication equipment under exclusive control of communication utilities, located outdoors or in building spaces used exclusively for such installations.

 Exception No. 4: Installation of communication or signaling equipment used exclusively for the operation of a municipal fire alarm or police telegraph system.

 Exception No. 5: Installations under the exclusive control of electric utilities for the purpose of communication, metering or for the generation, control, transformation, transmission and distribution of electric energy located in buildings used for such purposes or leased by the utility or on public highways, streets, roads or other public ways, or outdoors on established rights on private property up to service point as defined in this code. The installation and maintenance of all service conductors up to the point of connection to the consumer's service entrance conductors shall be the responsibility of the serving utility.

 80.4 Application to Existing Buildings.

 (A) Additions, Alterations and Repairs. Additions, alterations and repairs may be made to the electrical system of existing buildings or structures without making the entire electrical system comply with all of the requirements of this code for new buildings or structures, provided the additions, alterations or repairs that are made shall comply with the requirements of this code. This section does not limit the effect of applicable retroactive ordinances.

 Exception: Subject to the approval of the authority having jurisdiction, repairs may be made with the same materials of which the building or structure is constructed, other than for the replacement of receptacles as provided in NEC Section 406.3(D), provided the repair complies with the electrical code in effect at the time of original installation and provided further that no change shall be permitted which increases its hazard.

 (B) Existing Electrical Systems. Electrical systems in existence at the time of the passage of this code may continue to be used provided such use was legal at the time of the passage of this code and provided continued use is not detrimental to public safety.

 (C) Maintenance. All buildings or structures, both existing and new, and all parts thereof shall be maintained in a safe condition. All devices or safeguards required by this code or by a code in effect when the building or structure was erected, altered or repaired shall be maintained in good working order. The owner or the owner's agent shall be responsible for the maintenance of buildings and structures.

 It shall be the duty of the owner or the owner's agent to maintain in a safe and usable condition all parts of buildings or equipment that are intended to assist in the extinguishing of fire, or to prevent the origin or spread of fire, or to safeguard life or property. It shall be unlawful to fail to comply with any notice or order of the fire chief or the authority having jurisdiction.

 Exception: The authority having jurisdiction may modify the requirements of this subsection where all or a portion of a building is unoccupied.

 (D) Historic Buildings and Structures. The authority having jurisdiction may modify the specific requirements of this code as it applies to buildings and structures designated as landmarks of historical or cultural importance and require in lieu thereof alternate requirements that, in the opinion of the authority having jurisdiction, will result in a reasonable degree of safety to the public and the occupants of those buildings.

 A historic building or structure is one that has been designated for preservation by City Landmarks Preservation Board or the State of Washington; has been listed, or has been determined eligible to be listed, in the National Register of Historic Places; has been officially nominated for such status, or is a structure contributing to the character of a designated landmark or special review district.

 (E) Moved Buildings. Buildings or structures moved into or within the city shall comply with standards adopted by the authority having jurisdiction. No building shall be moved into or within the City unless, prior to moving, the authority having jurisdiction has inspected the building for compliance with those standards and the permit holder has agreed to correct all deficiencies found and has been issued an electrical permit for the work. Any moved building that is not in compliance with those standards within one year from the date of permit issuance and is found to be a public nuisance may be abated.

 Buildings wired by standards other than those recognized by this code and the National Electrical Code are not in compliance with these provisions.

 80.5 Tests. Whenever there is insufficient evidence of compliance with the provisions of this code or evidence that any material or construction does not conform to the requirements of this code, the authority having jurisdiction may require tests to be made, at no expense to the City, as proof of compliance.

 Test methods shall be specified by this code or by other recognized test standards. If there are no recognized and accepted test methods for the proposed alternate, the authority having jurisdiction shall determine the test procedures.

 All tests shall be made by an approved agency. The authority having jurisdiction shall retain reports of tests.

 80.6 Utilization Equipment and Alternate Materials and Methods of Wiring. This code does not prevent the use of any utilization equipment, material, method or design of wiring not specifically allowed or prohibited by this code, provided the same has been approved and its use authorized by the authority having jurisdiction.

 The authority having jurisdiction may approve an alternate, provided he/she finds that the proposed alternate complies with the provisions of this code and the alternate, when considered together with other safety features or relevant circumstances, will provide at least an equivalent level of strength, effectiveness, fire resistance, durability, safety and sanitation.

 The authority having jurisdiction may require that sufficient evidence or proof be submitted to substantiate any claims regarding the use or suitability of utilization equipment, material, method or design of wiring. The authority having jurisdiction may, but is not required to, record the approval of alternate materials and methods, and any relevant information in the files of the authority having jurisdiction or on the approved permit plans. This section supersedes the requirements of WAC 296-46B-030.

 80.7 Modifications. The authority having jurisdiction may grant modifications for individual cases whenever there are practical difficulties involved in carrying out the provisions of this code. The authority having jurisdiction must first find that the strict application of this code is impractical under the circumstances and that the modification is in conformity with the intent and purpose of this code and does not lessen any fire protection requirements or any degree of structural integrity. The authority having jurisdiction may, but is not required to, record the approval of modifications and any relevant information in the files of the authority having jurisdiction or on the approved permit plans.

 II. Organization and Enforcement

 80.52 Permits.

 (A) Issuance.

 (1) General. The application and plans filed by an applicant for a permit shall be checked by the authority having jurisdiction. Such plans may be reviewed by other departments of the City to check compliance with the laws and ordinances under their jurisdiction. If the authority having jurisdiction finds that the work as described in an application for permit and the plans filed therewith conforms to the requirements of this code and other pertinent laws and ordinances and that the fees specified in the Fee Subtitle have been paid, the authority having jurisdiction shall issue a permit to the applicant who becomes the permit holder. The authority having jurisdiction may refuse to issue an electrical permit to any person who refuses or fails to complete the work permitted by an existing permit(s) on the same building or premises.

 Exception No. 1: The authority having jurisdiction may issue a permit for the installation of part of the electrical system of a building or structure before complete plans for the whole building or structure have been submitted or approved, provided adequate information and detailed statements have been filed complying with all pertinent requirements of this code. Holders of such permits may proceed at their own risk without assurance that the permit for the entire building or structure will be granted.

 Exception No. 2: A permit may be issued for work to commence prior to the approval of plans, if such approval is delayed beyond 10 working days after the plans have been submitted for examination. The holders of such permits may proceed at their own risk, with the understanding that any work undertaken prior to approval of plans shall be done in accordance with the provisions of this code and in accordance with the plans as subsequently approved.

 (2) Compliance with Approved Plans and Permit. When issuing a permit, the authority having jurisdiction shall endorse the permit in writing and endorse in writing or stamp the plans APPROVED. Approved plans shall not be changed, modified or altered without authorization from the authority having jurisdiction, and all work shall be done in accordance with the approved plans, except as the authority having jurisdiction may require during field inspection to correct errors or omissions.

 (3) Amendments to the Permit. When substitutions and changes are made during construction, approval shall be secured prior to execution; however, the electrical inspector may approve minor modifications to the plans for work not reducing the fire and life safety of the structure. Substitutions, changes and clarifications shall be as shown on two sets of plans that shall be submitted to the authority having jurisdiction, accompanied by redesign fees, prior to occupancy. These changes shall conform to the requirements of this code and other pertinent laws and ordinances.

 (4) Requirement for License. No electrical permit shall be issued to an applicant who is engaging in, conducting or carrying on the business of installing wires or equipment to convey electric current or of installing apparatus to be operated by electric current unless the applicant possesses a valid State of Washington license as required by RCW 19.28. The licensed installer responsible for the work shall be identified on the electrical permit.

 Exception: Persons not possessing a license may obtain an electrical permit in order to do electrical work at a residence, farm, place of business or other property that they own as described in RCW 19.28.261.

 (5) Cancellation of Permit Application. If a permit is not issued after a period of sixty days from the date of approval for issuance or if corrections are not received after a period of sixty days from the date of notification of required corrections, the authority having jurisdiction may initiate cancellation procedures. Prior to cancellation, the authority having jurisdiction shall notify the applicant that the permit application will expire and shall be canceled after 30 days. After the applicant has been notified, the site may be inspected to verify that no work has taken place. The application shall be canceled 30 days after notice has been sent to the applicant, and it and any accompanying plans and specifications may be destroyed and the portion of the fee paid forfeited. Upon written request of the applicant, the authority having jurisdiction may extend the life of the permit application for a period not to exceed six months, with no further extensions possible, except that applications may be further extended by the authority having jurisdiction where permit issuance is delayed by litigation, appeals or similar problems.

 (B) Retention of Plans and Permits. One set of approved plans, which may be on microfilm, shall be retained by the authority having jurisdiction. One set of approved plans shall be returned to the applicant and shall be kept at the site or the building or work at all times during which the work authorized thereby is in progress. The plans shall be available at the site of the work or installation for use by inspection personnel at all times. The permit issued by the authority having jurisdiction shall be kept posted on the premises at all times during the course of the installation or work.

 (C) Validity. The issuance or granting of a permit or approval of plans shall not be construed to be a permit for, or an approval of, any violation of any of the provisions of this code or any other ordinance. No permit presuming to give authority to violate or

 cancel the provisions of this code shall be valid, except insofar as the work or use it authorizes is lawful.

 The issuance of a permit based upon plans shall not prevent the authority having jurisdiction from later requiring the corrections of errors in the plans. The issuance of a permit based upon plans shall not be construed as permitting violations of this code or of any other ordinance of the City.

 The issuance of an electrical permit shall not prevent the authority having jurisdiction from requiring correction of conditions found to be in violation of this code or any other ordinance of the City. The period of time for which a permit is issued shall not be construed to extend or otherwise affect any period of time for compliance specified in any notice or order issued by the authority having jurisdiction or other administrative authority requiring the correction of any such conditions.

 (D) Expiration and Renewal.
