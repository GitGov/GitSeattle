 ORDINANCE _________________

 AN ORDINANCE granting Kvichak Marine Industries, Inc., a maritime industrial business, permission to occupy the eastern half of the 6th Avenue NW and the NW Bowdoin Place shoreline street end right-of-way for a ten (10) year term; specifying the conditions under which this permit is granted; and providing for acceptance of the permit and conditions.

 WHEREAS, Ordinance 119673 authorized the Seattle Department of Transportation (SDOT) to issue annual permits for private uses of shoreline street ends; and

 WHEREAS, Resolution 29370 states that public improvements for shoreline street ends shall be permitted only in suitable locations and shall not conflict with existing industrial and/or water- dependent commercial activities; and

 WHEREAS, under SDOT Director's Rule 00-01, maritime industrial land uses and water-dependent commercial uses that show an important operational need for adjacency to a shoreline street end will be considered a higher priority use of the street end than public access; and

 WHEREAS, several maritime and water-dependent/related commercial businesses along the shoreline street ends have expressed a desire for longer terms of use of abutting street ends than is currently permitted via street use permits issued by SDOT pursuant to Title 15 of the Seattle Municipal Code, in order to assist their long term business planning and investment efforts; and

 WHEREAS, term permits will be reassessed and public access applications submitted to SDOT will be considered prior to the renewal of a term permit; and

 WHEREAS, the City acknowledges the shoreline street end importance and significance to the general public, to the industrial businesses and to water-dependent commercial activities; NOW THEREFORE,

 BE IT ORDAINED BY THE CITY OF SEATTLE AS FOLLOWS:

 Section 1. Subject to the terms and conditions of this ordinance, permission is hereby granted to Kvichak Marine Industries, Inc., its successors and assigns ("Permittee"), to occupy 3,786 square feet of 6th Avenue NW and the NW Bowdoin Place shoreline street end for temporary storage of materials that are business- related and, by nature, removable. No recreational furniture, equipment and improvements are to be placed in the street end. No excavation is permitted. The Director of Transportation ("Director"), in accordance with Director's Rule 00-01, may permit other uses that are also removable and temporary in nature.

 Section 2. The permit herein granted to the Permittee, its successors and assigns, shall be for a term of ten (10) years commencing on March 1, 2006, and terminating at 11:59 p.m. on February 29, 2016; provided, however, that upon written application of the Permittee at least thirty (30) days before expiration of the term, the Director may renew the permit for two (2) successive ten (10) year terms subject to the right of The City of Seattle ("City") by ordinance to then revise any of the terms and conditions contained herein or terminate the permit in accordance with Section 4.

 Section 3. In the event that the City orders cessation of use or removal of the private property from the shoreline street end pursuant to the terms of this ordinance, then within ninety (90) days after such expiration, termination or order of removal, or prior to the date stated in an "Order to Remove", as the case may be, the Permittee shall cease use and remove all private property from the shoreline street end public right-of-way, and restore it in as good condition for public use as it was prior to the start of this Term, and in at least as good condition in all respects as the abutting portions thereof. Whereupon, the Director shall issue a certificate discharging the Permittee from responsibility under this ordinance for occurrences after the date of such discharge. Permittee may notify the Director of intent to cease use, whereupon, the Director shall issue a certificate discharging Permittee from responsibility under this ordinance after all materials and other property are removed from the street end and the area is cleared and restored in a manner and to a condition satisfactory to the Director.

 Section 4. The permit granted hereby is subject to primary and secondary use by the public of the street end right-of-way for shoreline public access and utility purposes, and the City expressly reserves the right to require the Permittee to cease use and remove its materials and other property at the Permittee's sole cost and expense in the event that:

 a) The City Council determines, by ordinance, that the space occupied by the Permittee's use is necessary for any primary or secondary public use or benefit, or that the Permittee's use of the street end interferes with any primary or secondary public use or benefit; or

 b) The Director determines that any term or condition of this ordinance has been violated, and such violation has not been corrected by the Permittee after Notice of Violation has been given by the City; or

 c) The Director determines at the end of a ten year term that the street end is needed to provide shoreline access for the general public pursuant to a public access plan approved by the Director.

 A City Council determination that the space is necessary for a primary or secondary public use or benefit shall be conclusive and final.

 Section 5. Notwithstanding termination or expiration of this permit, the Permittee shall remain bound by its obligation under this ordinance until:

 a) all materials and other property are removed from the street end; and

 b) the area is cleared and restored in a manner and to a condition satisfactory to the

 Director; and

 c) the Director certifies that the Permittee has discharged its obligation herein.

 Section 6. The Permittee, by acceptance of the terms of this ordinance and the permit hereby granted, does release the City from any and all claims resulting from damage or loss to its own property and to the right-of-way and does covenant and agree for itself, its successors and assigns, with the City, to at all times protect and save harmless the City from all claims, actions, suits, liability, loss, costs, expense or damages of every kind and description (including, but not limited to, environmental claims, and excepting only such damages that may result from the sole negligence of the City), which may accrue to, or be suffered by, any person or persons and/or property or properties, including without limitation, damage or injury to the Permittee, its officers, agents, employees, contractors, invitees, tenants and tenants' invitees, licensees or its successors and assigns, or by reason of anything that has been done, or may at any time be done, by the Permittee, its successors or assigns, by reason of this ordinance (including use authorized by this ordinance), or by reason of the Permittee, its successors or assigns, failing or refusing to strictly comply with each and every provision of this ordinance; and if any such suit, action or claim be filed, instituted or begun against the City, the Permittee, its successors or assigns, shall, upon notice thereof from the City, defend the same at its or their sole cost and expense, and in case judgment shall be rendered against the City in any suit or action, the Permittee, its successors or assigns, shall fully satisfy said judgment within ninety (90) days after such action or suit shall have been finally determined, if determined adversely to the City. Provided that if it is determined by a court of competent jurisdiction that RCW 4.24.115 applies to this ordinance, then in the event claims or damages are caused by or result from the concurrent negligence of:

 a) the City, its agents, contractors or employees; and,

 b) the Permittee, its agents, contractors, employees or its successors or assigns, this indemnity provision shall be valid and enforceable only to the extent of the negligence of the Permittee or the Permittee's agents, contractors, employees or its successors or assigns.

 Solely with respect to claims for indemnification under this ordinance, Permittee waives, as to the City only and expressly not for the benefit of their employees or third parties, their immunity under Title 51 RCW, the Industrial Insurance Act, and acknowledges that this waiver has been mutually negotiated by the parties hereto.

 Section 7. Permittee's permission to use the shoreline street end is subject to protection of human and environmental health from Hazardous Substances or contamination (also referred to collectively as "contamination") that may be related to or discovered during any use or occupation of the shoreline street end by the Permittee. Permittee shall be responsible for any contamination related to or resulting from Permittee's use or occupation of the shoreline street end or other property during any period of this permit and any other periods of use or occupation of the shoreline street end or other property by the Permittee. Permittee shall exercise utmost care with respect to Hazardous Substances.

 Except as necessary for ordinary activities and in compliance with all applicable federal, state and local Environmental and Safety Laws, Permittee and its employees, agents and contractors shall not cause Hazardous Substances or contamination to occur in, on, under or adjacent to the shoreline street end or Permittee's property, or permit the same to be used for the generation, production, manufacture, refinement, transportation, treatment, storage, handling, disposal, transfer, release or processing of Hazardous Substances or contamination.

 With respect to the Permittee's operations, Permittee shall comply, and shall guarantee compliance by all of its employees, agents and contractors, with all Environmental or Safety Laws at all times during the term of this permit/ordinance. If Permittee or any of Permittee's employees, agents or contractors violates any applicable Environmental or Safety Laws or any of the terms of this permit/ordinance, Permittee shall promptly take such action as is necessary to mitigate and correct the violation at their sole expense. Permittee shall remain responsible for environmental conditions in accordance with any Environmental or Safety Laws.

 Except as provided in this ordinance at Section 6 (e.g., Permittee's releases of City), Permittee and the City reserve the right to recover contribution for Permittee's or the City's costs of Hazardous Substances management or remedial actions from other potentially liable persons or potentially responsible parties as those terms are defined under Environmental or Safety Laws. Permittee agrees that the City, solely by reason of being a public agency holding a shoreline street end property interest, is not an "owner or operator" for purposes of liability under any Environmental or Safety Laws, including, but not limited to, private rights of action for contribution under the Washington State Model Toxics Control Act (MTCA).

 Section 8. Whenever, in the judgment of the Risk Manager of the City of Seattle, insurance shall be required to protect the City of Seattle, the Permittee shall, upon demand by the Risk Manager, furnish such insurance in such amount as may be specified by the Risk Manager.

 Section 9. The Permittee shall not assign or transfer any privileges conferred by this ordinance without the consent of the Director. The Director shall be satisfied that the proposed assignee or transferee is financially capable of assuming the obligations under this permit, and that surety bonds and insurance coverage in sufficient amounts have been provided. If permission is granted, the assignee or transferee shall be bound by all terms and conditions of this ordinance. Notwithstanding the above language contained in this Section 9, consent of the City shall not be required for any transfer or assignment of the privileges conferred by this ordinance by way of mortgage, pledge or encumbrance or by way of foreclosure or deed in lieu of foreclosure of any mortgage, pledge or encumbrance.

 Section 10. The Permittee, its successors and assigns, shall pay to the City an annual fee for the privileges granted and exercised hereunder of Three Thousand Seven Hundred Eighty Six Dollars ($3,786.00) for each of the first five (5) years of the permit. The fee will be evaluated every five (5) years by the City for each succeeding five-year period. All payments shall be made to the City of Seattle Finance credited into the SDOT Shoreline Street End Cost Center.

 Section 11. The Permittee shall deliver its written acceptance of the permission conferred by this ordinance and its terms and conditions to the Director within sixty (60) days after the effective date of this ordinance. The acceptance shall be filed with the City Clerk. If no such acceptance is received by then, the privileges provided by this ordinance shall be deemed declined or abandoned; and the permission extended, contingent upon its acceptance, deemed lapsed and forfeited.

 Section 12. This ordinance shall take effect and be in force thirty (30) days from and after its approval by the Mayor, but if not approved and returned by the Mayor within ten (10) days after presentation, it shall take effect as provided by Municipal Code Section 1.04.020.
