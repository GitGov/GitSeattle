 EXHIBIT A

 Land Disposition Procedure for Remaining Property

 in the South Seattle Redevelopment Project Area

 The minimum bid price for property to be offered shall be based on the most recent assessed value as determined by the King County Assessor.

 The basis for disposing of property shall be by sealed competitive bids.

 The property to be conveyed AS-IS, WHERE-IS, WITH-ALL-FAULTS, AND WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY WHATSOEVER, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, AS TO ITS CONDITION, ENVIRONMENTAL OR OTHERWISE, OR ITS SUITABILITY OR SUFFICIENCY FOR THE PURCHASER'S INTENDED USES AND PURPOSES. The City makes no representation or warranty whatsoever as to the condition of the property to be conveyed to the purchaser.

 The property shall be conveyed by Quit Claim Deed.

 Bid packets shall include a brief description of the property offered, a neighborhood map, an Offer Sheet and Quit Claim Deed. Copies of the bid packet, environmental reports regarding the property, and other related documents shall be available to prospective bidders on request.

 Notice of the sale shall be given by publication in the Seattle Times and the Seattle Daily Journal of Commerce, and posted conspicuously at the property.

 If the property is located in an area zoned to permit the operation of retail business, then consistent with RCW 35.87.020 the first right to purchase will be offered to any bidder that is a private corporation or association (1) established to develop and maintain free public parking facilities and (2) which agrees to dedicate such property for free public parking. If any such bidder offers more than the minimum bid price, then the highest bid from such a bidder shall be selected and the property shall be sold to such bidder at the lower of such bid or the fair market value of the property as determined by the Housing Director, and the form of Quit Claim Deed shall be modified consistent with RCW 35.87.030.

 Except as provided in the previous paragraph, the successful bidder shall be the one offering the highest price equal to or exceeding the minimum bid price and agreeing to the terms of the Quit Claim Deed as authorized by ordinance.

 The Office of Housing Director or her designee shall evaluate the bids and select the successful bidder.

 The successful bidder must complete the sale, paying the full amount of its bid by cashier's check or equivalent acceptable to the Housing Director, within sixty (60) days after the Office of Housing Director selects the successful bidder. If the selected bidder fails to complete the purchase then the Housing Director may, in her discretion, sell the property to the bidder, if any, that would have been selected had the first selected bidder not bid.

 The Housing Director may reserve the rights to waive irregularities, to allow corrections, and to extend the period in which bids may be submitted.

 The Housing Director may require a bid deposit, and in the event that the winning bidder does not close on the transaction in the time allotted, the bid deposit will be retained as liquidated damages.
