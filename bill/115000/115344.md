 Section 5 - Computing Tailwater Encroachment Losses

 5.1 The Parties shall calculate TEL, as defined in Section 1.6 of this agreement, by simulating the theoretical output of the Box Canyon Project in the absence of encroachment from the Boundary Project and comparing that theoretical output to the actual output of Box Canyon Project during operation and encroachment from the Boundary Project. As much as possible, the simulation process shall use measured physical parameters.

 5.2 Effective August 1, 2005, the Parties shall no longer use the methodology and procedures established by the December 1970 Report of the Board of Engineers and shall instead use and apply the methodology described in the Principles and Procedures for Calculating TEL, attached hereto as Attachment 1 and incorporated into this Encroachment Delivery Agreement by this reference, for calculating compensation due the District under the City's Boundary Project FERC license for all loss of capacity, power, and energy production resulting from the Boundary Project reservoir's encroachment into the Box Canyon Project tailwater.

 Section 6 - Errors and Changes

 6.1 A Party that discovers an error in the calculation of the TEL shall promptly notify the other Party so that corrections can be made in an expeditious manner. The City shall correct errors and make any necessary recalculations, as follows:

 (a) where the date of the beginning of the error is known, the City shall recalculate TEL back to the date of the error or back 12 months, whichever period is shorter;

 (b) where the date of the beginning of the error is unknown, the City shall recalculate TEL back for a period of 12 months; or

 (c) as the Parties may otherwise agree.

 6.2 The Parties shall schedule delivery of compensation for corrected TEL as provided in Section 7, below, or as the Parties may otherwise agree.

 Section 7 - Scheduling

 7.1 Upon the energization date of the Boundary Transformer or October 1, 2009, whichever is earlier, the City shall deliver compensation to the District for TEL in the manner and in accordance with the scheduling criteria established by this section.

 7.2 By or before 09:00 hours prevailing local time on the day following each day the District has experienced TEL, the City will provide the District with the calculation of TEL compensation for that day and a corresponding hourly schedule for the delivery of TEL compensation to be delivered on the seventh day following the day the District has experienced TEL.

 7.3 Unless otherwise agreed and subject to any adjustments made under this section, the City shall schedule delivery of TEL compensation to the District on a daily basis and shall make delivery of TEL compensation on the seventh day following each day the District has experienced TEL. The City will schedule delivery of TEL compensation in whole megawatt-hours (MWh) on the appropriate prescheduling day as established by customary business practices.

 7.4 The City shall deliver TEL compensation to the District at the points of delivery, described below, as follows:

 (a) when Boundary Project is generating sufficient capacity, at the high side of the Boundary Transformer;

 (b) when Boundary Project is not generating (i.e., it is off-line), at other points of interconnection between BPA and the District to which the City can redirect transmission capacity in an economical manner under its transmission service agreement(s) with BPA;

 (c) when Boundary Project is not generating sufficient capacity to satisfy the TEL schedule, including adjustments, at the high side of the Boundary Transformer and/or at other points of interconnection between BPA and the District to which the City can redirect transmission capacity in an economical manner under its transmission service agreement(s) with BPA, as reasonably proposed by the City; or

 (d) at any other delivery point as the Parties may otherwise agree.

 7.5 To accommodate Daylight Savings Time changes, the Parties will adjust scheduling of delivery of TEL compensation as follows:

 Each April, on the 23-hour day that Daylight Savings Time begins, the City will withhold from delivering that portion of TEL compensation otherwise scheduled for delivery during the hour ending 0200, as reflected in the TEL calculation and schedule for the 24-hour day seven days earlier, and will, instead, schedule delivery of TEL compensation for the missing hour seven days later when compensation for the hour ending 0200 is missing from the TEL calculation and schedule for the 23-hour day.

 Each October, on the 25-hour day when Daylight Savings Time ends, the Parties shall schedule over a 25-hour day by filling the extra hour ending 0200 with zero (0) megawatts because no energy was scheduled for that extra hour in the daily TEL schedule that was produced seven days earlier. Then, the energy of the extra hour ending 0200 that appears on the daily TEL schedule as a result of the extra hour ending 0200 on the day that Daylight Savings Time ends shall be added to the energy schedule seven days later and scheduled over the 24- hour day.

 7.6 The Parties may adjust delivery schedules for:

 (a) transmission losses compensation as provided in Section 8;

 (b) correction of errors as provided in Section 6;

 (c) adjustments for Daylight Savings Time as described above; or

 (d) other factors, as the Parties may otherwise agree.

 7.7 The Parties agree to revise the provisions of this section as needed to be consistent with customary business practices of the time, such revision to be documented in writing signed or otherwise acknowledged by both Parties.

 Section 8 - Transmission Losses Compensation

 The District shall compensate the City for any transmission losses compensation the City may owe BPA, if any, resulting from TEL compensation deliveries the City makes to the District via the Boundary Transformer. Unless the Parties otherwise agree, the City shall deduct from the TEL compensation calculations and delivery schedules any hourly transmission loss compensation it may owe BPA, pursuant to the City's transmission service agreement with BPA, resulting from TEL compensation deliveries the City makes to the District via the Boundary Transformer.

 Section 9 - Financial Settlement Option

 9.1 The Parties agree that during the period beginning August 1, 2005, and until the earlier of the date upon which the Boundary Transformer is energized and fully operational or October 31, 2009, the City's obligation to compensate the District for TEL shall be satisfied by the City's payment of monthly financial settlements. The calculation of monthly financial settlements shall be based on the hourly TEL compensation as it would have been delivered pursuant to Section 7 and the Dow Jones Firm Mid-C Daily Price Index for Light Load Hours and/or Heavy Load Hours, as the case may be. During this period, the settlement process and payment terms shall be as follows:

 9.1.1 On or before the 10th of September 2005, and on or before the 10th calendar day of each succeeding month thereafter, the City shall calculate the TEL in accordance with this Encroachment Delivery Agreement and submit for the District's approval a monthly summary of the hourly TEL as these would have otherwise been scheduled pursuant to Section 7 multiplied by the appropriate hourly index price.

 9.1.2 Upon approval of the summary provided in Section 9.1.1, the District shall invoice the City for the total computed value of TEL for the month via facsimile notice sent to the billing contact listed below in Section 10.

 9.1.3 The City shall pay each monthly invoice within 10 days of receipt, except that when the due date falls on a Saturday, Sunday, or City holiday, the due date shall be the next business day. Invoices not paid in full on or before the close of business on the due date shall be subject to an interest charge, applied each day to the unpaid balance, calculated on the basis of the Prime Rate for Large Banks as reported in the Wall Street Journal, plus three (3) percent. The applicable interest rate shall be the rate reported on the first day of the month in which payment is received.

 9.2 After the Boundary Transformer commences full-time operation or October 31, 2009, whichever is earlier, the City may, subject to the mutual agreement of the District, satisfy its obligation to compensate the District for TEL, or any portion thereof, by the City's payment of financial settlements. The Parties shall confirm in writing signed by both Parties the agreed price and payment terms for financial settlements reached under this subsection.

 Attachment 1: Principles and Procedures for Calculating Tailwater Encroachment Losses (TEL)

 Page 10 of 10

 Page 1 of 10 Exhibit A to Ordinance

 PRINCIPLES AND PROCEDURES FOR

 CALCULATING TAILWATER ENCROACHMENT LOSSES (TEL)

 The Parties agree that tailwater encroachment losses (TEL) for Box Canyon Project shall be calculated based on the principle that encroachment losses are equivalent to the theoretical generation output without encroachment minus actual generation output after encroachment. Thus, TEL shall be calculated from the following equation:

 TEL = Gn - Gm

 Gn = Gn1 + Gn2 + Gn3 + Gn4

 SS0 = SS / (Gm1 + Gm2 + Gm3 + Gm4)

 Gm = Gm1 + SS0 * Gm1 + Gm2 + SS0 * Gm2 + Gm3 + SS0 * Gm3 + Gm4 + SS0 * Gm4

 GHn = FBm - TWn

 GHm = FBm - TWm

 Where TEL = tailwater encroachment losses

 Gn = sum of generation from all units without encroachment

 Gm = sum of generation from all units with encroachment

 Gni (where i = 1, 2, 3 or 4) = individual unit generation without encroachment

 Gmi (where i = 1, 2, 3 or 4) = individual unit generation with encroachment (measured)

 SS = total energy used for station service (measured)

 SS0 = normalized energy used for station service

 GHn = plant gross head without encroachment

 GHm = plant gross head with encroachment

 FBm = forebay elevation (measured)

 TWn = tailwater elevation without encroachment

 TWm = tailwater elevation with encroachment (measured)

 Following are step-by-step instructions for calculating hourly TEL:

 1. For each hour of the day, determine each of the four Box Canyon units power output (Gm1, Gm2, Gm3, and Gm4) from watt-hour readings exactly on the hour of interest.

 2. For each hour of the day, determine the total energy used for station service (SS) on the hour of interest.

 3. Determine the average Box Canyon intake forebay elevation (FBm) for each hour, by averaging the four 15-minute interval readings from the District's forebay gauge: exactly on the hour of interest, 15 minutes after the hour, 30 minutes after the hour, and 45 minutes after the hour.

 4. Determine the average Box Canyon tailwater elevation (TWm) immediately downstream of the powerhouse for each hour, by averaging the four 15-minute interval readings from the USGS gauge no. 12396500 Pend Oreille River Below Box Canyon near Ione, Washington (use 02_00065 gauge height readings).

 5. Determine the average hourly discharge in CFS from Box Canyon Project for each hour, by averaging the four 15-minute interval readings from the USGS gauge no. 12396500 Pend Oreille River Below Box Canyon near Ione, Washington (use 01_00060 discharge readings). The USGS discharge data may be adjusted and/or averaged to smooth transient variability through an algorithm provided by USGS, or as otherwise mutually agreed by the Parties.

 6. Compute the unencroached tailwater elevation (TWn ) corresponding to the hourly discharge as obtained from step (5) using USGS Rating Table for Pend Oreille River below Box Canyon Dam Near Ione, Washington (use USGS Rating Table No. 8, October 1, 1966).

 7. Compute plant gross heads with (GHm) and without (GHn) encroachment.

 8. Based on Box Canyon turbine-generator's power-discharge-head relationship as established by the December 1970 Report of the Board of Engineers, determine individual unit turbine discharge (Q1, Q2, Q3, and Q4) from individual unit power output (Gm1, Gm2, Gm3, and Gm4) that has been adjusted for station service energy and plant gross head with encroachment (GHm).

 9. Using the same power-discharge-head relationship, determine individual unit power output without encroachment (Gn1, Gn2, Gn3, and Gn4) from unit turbine discharge (Q1, Q2, Q3, and Q4) as derived from step (8) and plant gross head without encroachment (GHn).

 10. TEL is calculated to the nearest kWh. Since TEL is scheduled in whole MWh, the amount of TEL to be scheduled for each hour shall be determined by rounding down to the nearest integer. Fractions of a MWh of TEL that are not scheduled due to such rounding shall be carried over to subsequent hours and accumulated until the sum of the total accumulated unscheduled TEL is at least one MWh, at which time the integer amount so carried over shall be added to the scheduled TEL of the hour and any fraction then remaining shall be carried over to subsequent hours to be accumulated with later MWh fractions, as before.
