 ORDINANCE _________________

 AN ORDINANCE changing the method of appointment for Planning Commission members; and amending Seattle Municipal Code Section 3.64.030.

 WHEREAS, the City Charter currently provides that the Mayor shall appoint Planning Commission members, subject to confirmation by the City Council; and

 WHEREAS, for a number of other City boards and commissions, the Council and Mayor share appointment authority, each appointing roughly half the members of the board or commission; and

 WHEREAS, sharing appointment authority for members of boards and commissions between the Council and Mayor provides for broader representation and greater accountability; and

 WHEREAS, the Seattle Municipal Code is a more appropriate place than the City Charter to specify the details about appointment of members of boards and commissions, and in fact most boards and commissions are described and regulated via the Seattle Municipal Code and not via the Charter; and

 WHEREAS, the City Council has adopted Resolution 30897 as a companion to this Council Bill, submitting a proposition to the voters of the City to amend the Charter to state that the manner in which members of the Planning Commission shall be appointed shall be provided by ordinance; and

 WHEREAS, if the voters approve the Charter amendment, then this Council Bill will take effect and will add language to the Seattle Municipal Code providing that the City Council and the Mayor will each appoint seven members of the Planning Commission and the fifteenth member shall be appointed by the Commission as constituted; NOW, THEREFORE,

 BE IT ORDAINED BY THE CITY OF SEATTLE AS FOLLOWS:

 Section 1. The positions on the Planning Commission shall be numbered from one (1) through fifteen (15). Commissioners in office as of the effective date of this section shall be taken in order by the expiration date of the current term, and within each group with the same expiration date, in alphabetical order by last name, and shall be assigned to positions starting with position one through however many commissioners there are. Expiration dates of the current terms of commissioners in office on the effective date of this ordinance shall not be affected by this ordinance.

 Section 2. Section 3.64.030 of the Seattle Municipal Code is hereby amended as follows:

 3.64.030 Appointment and term.

Members in odd-numbered positions on the Commission from position one (1) through position thirteen (13) shall be appointed by a majority vote of the City Council, and members in even numbered positions shall be appointed by the Mayor subject to confirmation by a majority vote of the City Council, and the member in position fifteen (15) shall be appointed by the Commission as constituted.~~The Mayor shall appoint members of the Commission subject to confirmation by the City Council.~~ The term of office shall be for three (3) years, and the terms of one-third (1/3) of the members shall expire each year. A Commission member whose term has expired shall continue to hold office until a successor has qualified. No member shall serve more than two (2) consecutive terms. Any vacancy shall be filled for an unexpired term in the same manner as for an original appointment under this section as amended. All Commission members shall be qualified electors of the City. ~~Present members of the Planning Commission are appointed members of the Planning Commission, to serve for the remainder of the terms for which they were appointed.~~

 Section 3. Sections 1 and 2 of this ordinance will take effect if and only if the voters approve the Charter amendment submitted to them by Resolution 30897 and if the voters approve that Charter amendment, then Sections 1 and 2 will take effect on the date that the Charter amendment takes effect.

 Section 4. This ordinance shall take effect and be in force thirty (30) days from and after its approval by the Mayor, but if not approved and returned by the Mayor within ten (10) days after presentation, it shall take effect as provided by Municipal Code Section 1.04.020.
