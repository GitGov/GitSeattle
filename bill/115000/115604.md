 ORDINANCE _________________

 AN ORDINANCE implementing a court order regarding Seattle Public Utilities' funding of the City's One Percent for Art program; appropriating funds to Finance General to reimburse the Drainage and Wastewater Fund, the Water Fund, and the Solid Waste Fund for expenditures on certain public art projects; and transferring jurisdiction of certain art projects from Seattle Public Utilities to the Office of Arts and Cultural Affairs; all by a three-fourths vote of the City Council.

 WHEREAS, in Okeson v. Seattle, the Washington State Court of Appeals upheld the City's One Percent for Art ordinance as applied to the City Light Department ("City Light"), but also held that art funded by City Light must have a sufficiently close nexus to the utility's fundamental purpose of providing electricity to its ratepayers; and

 WHEREAS, the legal principles set forth in Okeson apply to art funded by Seattle Public Utilities ("Utilities"), whose art expenditures were challenged in Lane v. Seattle; and

 WHEREAS, the City of Seattle ("City") and the plaintiffs in Lane v. Seattle reached a settlement regarding the art issues, which became final with the trial court's entry of a Stipulation and Order on May 12, 2006 (the "Stipulation," attached hereto as Attachment 1); and

 WHEREAS, the Stipulation requires the City to reimburse the Utilities' three funds, plus interest, for utility moneys spent on art projects identified by an asterisk in Exhibit A of the Stipulation, and to transfer jurisdiction over those art projects to another City department; and

 WHEREAS, the Office of Arts and Cultural Affairs is another City department and is well-equipped to accept jurisdiction of the transferred art projects on behalf of the general government of the City; NOW, THEREFORE,

 BE IT ORDAINED BY THE CITY OF SEATTLE AS FOLLOWS:

 Section 1. To comply with paragraph 11 of the Stipulation, requiring reimbursement with interest to the Utilities' three funds for expenditures on art projects identified by an asterisk in Exhibit A of the Stipulation, the appropriation for the following in the 2006 Budget is increased from the fund shown, as follows:

 Item Fund Department Budget Control Level Amount 1 General Subfund Finance General Reserves (2QD00) $175,000 (00100) Total $175,000

 Section 2. To comply with paragraph 10 of the Order, jurisdiction over the art projects identified by an asterisk in Exhibit A of the Stipulation is hereby transferred from the Utilities to the Office of Arts and Cultural Affairs.

 Section 3. Any act consistent with the authority of this ordinance taken after the passage of the ordinance is hereby ratified and confirmed.

 Section 4. This ordinance shall take effect and be in force thirty (30) days from and after its approval by the Mayor, but if not approved and returned by the Mayor within ten (10) days after presentation, it shall take effect as provided by Municipal Code Section 1.04.020.

 Passed by a three-fourths (3/4) vote of all the members of the City Council the ____ day of _________, 2006, and signed by me in open session in authentication of its passage this _____ day of __________, 2006.

 IN THE SUPERIOR COURT OF THE STATE OF WASHINGTON

 FOR KING COUNTY

 ARTHUR T. LANE, KENNETH GOROHOFF and WALTER L. WILLIAMS, individually and on behalf of the class of all persons similarly situated,

 Plaintiffs,

 vs.

 THE CITY OF SEATTLE,

 Defendant/Third Party Plaintiff,

 vs.

 THE CITY OF SHORELINE, a Washington municipal corporation; THE CITY OF BURIEN, a Washington municipal corporation; THE CITY OF LAKE FOREST PARK, a Washington municipal corporation; and KING COUNTY, a Washington municipal corporation,

 CLASS ACTION

 No. 05-2-07351-9 SEA

 STIPULATION AND ORDER REGARDING ONE PERCENT FOR ART CLAIM

 STIPULATION

 By this Stipulation, the Plaintiffs and the Defendant City of Seattle (the "City") intend to adopt, by way of compromise, and without prejudice to or waiver of their respective positions in this or other matters, without trial or adjudication of any issues of fact or law, a full and final settlement of the One Percent for Art claim in this case. The Plaintiffs and the City therefore stipulate as follows:

 A. General

 1. The Court of Appeals in Okeson v. Seattle, 130 Wn. App. 814 (2005), affirmed the trial court's rulings regarding Seattle City Light (SCL) art that (a) art funded by SCL must have a sufficiently close nexus to SCL's fundamental purpose of providing electricity to its ratepayers; (b) that a large portion of the SCL art projects challenged by those ratepayers improperly benefited the public, rather than SCL or its ratepayers in particular, and therefore, should not have been funded with SCL moneys; (c) restricting the types of art projects that the municipality could support with SCL moneys; and (d) ordering the transfer of funds from the municipality's general fund to the Light Fund.

 2. The Court of Appeals in that case reversed the trial court's ruling invalidating application of the City's One Percent for Art ordinance, SMC Ch. 20.32. Recognizing that the City's administration of the Municipal Art Fund with respect to art funded by SCL in the past violated the nexus requirement, the Court required that SCL funds, including those paid into the Municipal Art Fund under the One Percent for Art ordinance, may be used to purchase, acquire or support art or art projects only if the art or art projects have a sufficiently close nexus to SCL's primary purpose of furnishing electricity to its ratepayers.

 3. The Plaintiffs and the City agree that the legal principles set forth in the Court of Appeals' decision in Okeson v. Seattle relating to SCL art likewise apply to art funded by Seattle Public Utilities ("SPU"). However, no factual findings have been made about SPU art in the present case.

 4. Accordingly, the City's One Percent for Art ordinance, SMC Ch. 20.32, may be implemented with respect to SPU, as long as all art funded by SPU has a sufficiently close nexus to SPU's fundamental purpose of providing its component services to its ratepayers - drainage and wastewater, water, and solid waste.

 5. Art projects with a sufficiently close nexus to SPU's primary purpose include art used (1) to beautify the utility's offices and customer service facilities, (2) in the construction or renovation of utility facilities, or (3) to educate the public about conservation, although the conservation rationale may not be used as justification for expending SPU funds merely because it mentions water, drainage, wastewater, or solid waste.

 6. Art projects that do not have a sufficiently close nexus to SPU include (1) art that is displayed in other City offices without compensation to SPU or in permanent traveling public exhibitions, (2) art projects used for advertising or public relations or that have the primary purpose of improving SPU's image in a particular neighborhood or community, (3) art projects, including mitigation of the appearance of utility facilities, whose primary purpose is to provide artistic benefit to the surrounding neighborhood and the public as a whole; and (4) art projects that rely on conservation education as a pretext for expending utility funds, but whose primary purpose is to provide artistic benefit to the general public.

 7. SPU may continue to pay for the costs of maintaining SPU's portable art works collection and its other permissible utility arts projects.

 B. Specific Provisions

 8. By March 1, 2007, SPU shall accomplish one of the following for any pieces of its portable art works collection on display in other City departments:

 a. return the SPU portable art work to SPU facilities or storage; or

 b. transfer ownership of the art work to another City department or to a third party, at a price equal to the art work's true and full value, as determined by an independent appraisal, offer at auction, or similar means of determining what the market will pay for the work, or if the City believes it would be needlessly expensive or inefficient to obtain an independent appraisal, at a price equal to the book value at which the work is carried on the books of the Office of Arts and Cultural Affairs, which is generally measured by cost of acquisition plus increases at the rate of the Consumer Price Index (as adjusted if the piece is damaged); or

 c. charge rent for any of its portable works on display in other City departments, at a reasonable rental fee equal to current market rental value, as determined by an independent appraisal or, if the City believes it would be needlessly expensive or inefficient to obtain an independent appraisal, based on one-twentieth per year of the book value at which the work is carried on the books of the Office of Arts and Cultural Affairs, which is generally measured by cost of acquisition plus increases at the rate of the Consumer Price Index (as adjusted if the piece is damaged), plus the cost of installing and returning the rented portable works, plus compensation for any damage to or loss of an SPU art work while on rental; provided, however, that nothing contained in this stipulation or in any order based on this stipulation shall be construed as authorizing or prohibiting SPU from renting to other City departments any art works that were acquired by SPU after the date of this stipulation.

 9. SPU may accommodate requests from museums or similar non-profit agencies for a temporary loan of any of its portable art works, without charge, so long as the loan is for a period not longer than nine months and provided that the non-profit agency agrees to pay the cost of installing and returning the loaned portable art work, to pay SPU for any damage or loss of the SPU art work while it is on loan, and to credit SPU as owner of the work.

 10. By August 1, 2006, the City and SPU shall transfer ownership of the art works and arts projects identified by an asterisk in the spreadsheet in Exhibit A to this stipulation from SPU to another department of the City.

 11. Within that same time period, the Drainage and Wastewater Fund will be reimbursed a total of $61,436.00, plus interest as described below, the Water Fund will be reimbursed a total of $38,145.00, plus interest as described below, and the Solid Waste Fund will be reimbursed a total of $20,145.00, plus interest as described below, from other City funds for the transfer of ownership of the art works and projects set forth on Exhibit A to this stipulation. Reimbursement will bear simple interest from the date SPU acquired each art work or project to the date the City reimburses the SPU, at the average of the City's cash pool earnings rate for the period from time of acquisition to the time of transfer of ownership.

 12. The Plaintiffs' right to seek an award of attorney fees and expenses in this matter, including fees and costs based on the settlement of the One Percent for Art claim, is expressly reserved. The City reserves its right to oppose the Plaintiffs' request for fees.
