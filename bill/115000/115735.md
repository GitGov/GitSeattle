 ORDINANCE _________________

 AN ORDINANCE relating to a ballot proposition concerning regular property taxes; repealing Ordinance 122193 and ratifying and confirming acts consistent with not placing that proposition on the November 2006 ballot.

 WHEREAS, Ordinance 122193 provided for the submission to the voters of a particular proposition regarding a property tax levy for the purpose of providing City facilities and services, including transportation improvements, both capital and operating; and,

 WHEREAS the City Council and Mayor acknowledge that the residents of Seattle have raised concerns over the levy structure that was proposed in Ordinance 122193 and would instead prefer a proposal that provides a higher degree of accountability to the voters; and,

 WHEREAS the critical transportation maintenance projects to be addressed by the measure proposed in Ordinance 122193 can be funded through a phased approach, rather than a single 20-year property tax measure; and,

 WHEREAS, a council bill has been introduced that would instead submit to the voters a phased approach to a property tax levy for implementing transportation improvements; and,

 WHEREAS, the City intends the phased approach, if submitted to the voters at the November 7, 2006 election, to be a substitute instead of the proposition contained in Ordinance 122193;

 NOW, THEREFORE,
