 ORDINANCE _________________

 AN ORDINANCE authorizing Seattle Public Utilities to acquire by negotiation or condemnation land and all improvements thereon situated on Lots 1,2,3,4,5 and 6 of Block 71 and Lots 6 and 7 of Block 62, all in the Lake Union Addition to Seattle, Washington and generally bordered by 34th Street North, 36th Street North, Carr Place North and Densmore Avenue North, for solid waste system and other utility and general municipal purposes.

 WHEREAS, Resolution 30431 directed Seattle Public Utilities to develop a 20-year Solid Waste Facilities Master Plan to deliver cost- effective and environmentally beneficial solid waste reuse, recycling, collection and disposal services; and

 WHEREAS, the draft Solid Waste Facilities Master Plan dated November, 2003 (the "Plan") concludes that the City's existing solid waste facilities are inadequate to meet those objectives; and

 WHEREAS, the Plan further concludes that the City's North Recycling and Disposal Station (the "NRDS") suffers from a number of serious service constraints resulting in frequent lines of motor vehicles extending onto the public roadway, significant customer delays and insufficient space to improve recycling and reuse facilities; and

 WHEREAS, to address service problems at the NRDS, the Plan recommends acquisition of approximately one and one-half acres of adjacent property for public drop-off space for reuse items and recyclables, employee facilities and other solid waste system uses; and

 WHEREAS, acquisition of the adjacent property is consistent with the 1998 Solid Waste Plan, adopted by Resolution 29805, and with the 2004 amendment to that plan, adopted by Resolution 30750; and

 WHEREAS, RCW 35.21.152 and RCW 8.12.030 authorize the City to purchase or condemn property for solid waste purposes; and

 WHEREAS, the City has determined that the property legally described below is suitable for the expansion of the NRDS and that it is in the public interest to acquire the same for the purposes enumerated above; NOW, THEREFORE,

 BE IT ORDAINED BY THE CITY OF SEATTLE AS FOLLOWS:
