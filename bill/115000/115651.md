The payment of all delinquent installments, together with interest, penalty and costs, at any time before the entry of judgment in foreclosure shall extend the time of payment on the remainder of the assessment installments as if there had been no delinquency or foreclosure. Foreclosure proceedings may be commenced at any time on or before November 15 of the year in which, on the first day of January of such year, two (2) installments of any local improvement district or utility local improvement district assessment were delinquent or the final installment was delinquent for more than one (1) year. In case of foreclosure, there shall be added to the costs and expenses provided by Chapter 35.50 RCW, such reasonable attorneys' fees as the court may adjudge to be equitable, and the amount thereof shall be apportioned to each delinquent assessment or installment appearing on that roll. When one (1) or more delinquent installments are paid before the foreclosure proceedings are completed, payment of such costs shall be a prerequisite to the city's dismissal of such proceedings unless otherwise ordered by the court.

 Section 2. This ordinance shall take effect and be in force thirty (30) days from and after its approval by the Mayor, but if not approved and returned by the Mayor within ten (10) days after presentation, it shall take effect as provided by Municipal Code Section 1.04.020.
