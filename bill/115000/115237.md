 Section 1. The City Council hereby adopts the following legislative findings of fact:

 a. The Seattle Monorail Project proposes to construct monorail stations at various locations in the City of Seattle, including Crown Hill/85th Street.

 b. It is in the public interest that land use and development in the vicinity of this station be compatible with and help support the operation of the monorail. This policy is consistent with the Seattle Comprehensive Plan, and with state policies including, but not limited to, those contained in Chapter 81.104, RCW.

 c. The City is currently studying proposed changes to the Pedestrian Designated Zone as part of Monorail Station Area planning and the Neighborhood Business Development Strategy at various station locations.

 d. The City has been apprised of development projects in the vicinity of the Crown Hill/85th Street monorail station area that may establish vested rights and result in uses that are incompatible with desired land uses before permanent station area regulations become effective, and therefore, the City's ability to implement these City and state policies may be compromised or thwarted.

 e. The City is authorized to adopt interim zoning ordinances to prevent vesting of development rights pursuant to, among other authority, Article 11, Section 11 of the Washington State Constitution, and the Growth Management Act, Chapter 36.70A, RCW.

 Section 2. As of the effective date of this Ordinance, the official Land Use Map, Chapter 23.32 of the Seattle Municipal Code is amended to rezone certain properties located on Plat 2E, page 37; Plat 3W, page 38; Plat 230E, page 23; and Plat 231W, page 24 of the Official Land Use Map, as shown on Exhibit A attached to this ordinance, to add the Pedestrian District 2 designation in the vicinity of the Crown Hill/85th Street Station Area.

 Section 3. The interim zoning adopted pursuant to Section 2 of this Ordinance shall expire on April 1, 2006.

 Section 4. The City Council directs the Department of Planning and Development (DPD) to prepare legislation to permanently add the Pedestrian District designation to the Crown Hill/85th Street, Northwest Market Street, and the Morgan and West Seattle Junction Station Areas, as contained in the November 2004 Station Area Planning Draft Recommendations, based upon locational criteria, as may be amended by the Neighborhood Business District Strategy legislation that will be under consideration by the City Council during 2005.

 Monorail Station Area Pedestrian Designation Work Plan and Schedule

 April 7, 2005

 The City Council directs the Department of Planning and Development (DPD) to prepare legislation to apply the Pedestrian District designation to the Crown Hill/ 85th Street, Market Street, and the Morgan and West Seattle (Alaska) Junction Station Areas, as contained in the November 2004 Station Area Planning Draft Recommendations, based upon locational criteria, as may be amended by the Neighborhood Business District Strategy legislation that will be under consideration by the City Council during 2005.

 The City Council recognizes that this work will need to proceed in tandem with or immediately following upon the City Council's review and action on the proposed NBDS legislation. The Council's review of the NBDS proposed legislation will occur in the 2nd and 3rd Quarters of 2005, and may not be completed until 4th Quarter 2005. Therefore, DPD's work to analyze and apply the revised Pedestrian District designation to the Monorail Station Areas may not be completed until 1st Quarter 2006.

 DPD should prepare legislation to implement any regulatory changes, and should complete environmental review as required under the State Environmental Policy Act (SEPA).

 DPD is requested to submit periodic progress reports on the status of its efforts under this work plan to Councilmember Peter Steinbrueck, Chair, Urban Development and Planning Committee.
