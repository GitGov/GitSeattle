 (the "Property") on the terms and subject to the conditions authorized in this ordinance. HomeSight and any approved designee, and any assignee of the Agreement approved by the Director, are referred to as "Purchaser". The Agreement shall be in the form attached to this ordinance as Attachment A, with any revisions and additions not inconsistent with the express terms of this ordinance or with applicable law that the Director may determine are reasonably necessary to carry out the intent of this ordinance. All except $33,800 of the stated sale price for the Property of $1,046,000 shall be deferred under a non-recourse promissory note ("Note") in accordance with the Agreement. The Purchaser may earn forgiveness of up to the entire deferred portion, and interest thereon, through sale of at least 20 units to low-income homebuyers, subject to resale restrictions intended to require that the units remain affordable as set forth in the Agreement. The terms of the Note, and forgiveness thereof, shall be substantially as set forth in Attachment A.

 In order to carry out the Agreement for and on behalf of the City, the Director is authorized to execute a deed for the Property in substantially the form attached hereto as an Exhibit to the Agreement, and upon satisfaction of the conditions precedent under the Agreement, except for any that may be waived in writing by the Director, the Director is authorized to cause the deed to be recorded and delivered to Purchaser. The Director is authorized to execute, deliver, accept, record, modify, and administer any other documents, which may include amendments and extensions to the Agreement, and take any other action that he or she shall deem necessary or advisable to implement the purpose of this ordinance.

 Section 2. The Agreement shall require Purchaser to use diligent efforts to pursue design work, financing applications, environmental reports, permit applications and all other steps necessary to construct and permanently finance improvements on the Property as described in Section 3 of this ordinance. All such efforts shall be at Purchaser's own expense and risk. The Agreement may provide interim deadlines as deemed appropriate by the Director, which may be extended at the discretion of the Director. The Agreement shall terminate if the conditions for transfer of the Property by the City are not satisfied within two years of the effective date of this ordinance, except for possible extensions as provided for in the Agreement.

 Section 3. At time of initial sale of dwelling units to be developed on the Property, at least 51% of the dwelling units in the Property must be affordable to, and initially occupied by, buyers with incomes at or below 80% of median income. In addition, at least 20 of those units must have resale restrictions to help ensure those units remain affordable to low-income households for a term as set forth in Section 3.02 of Attachment A. The housing, together with any additional improvements to be developed on the Property with the approval of the Director and all necessary regulatory approvals, are referred to in this ordinance as the "Project".

 Section 4. The City Council recognizes that the actual development capacity of the Property will depend upon the results of applicable regulatory processes and financial feasibility. If the Director determines that, because of regulatory, financial or other constraints, Purchaser will be unable to develop a project on the Property that includes the minimum number of units affordable to low- income households stated in Section 3, then the Director may recommend an alternative plan to City Council for the Property, which shall require approval by ordinance.

 Section 5. The Agreement shall provide for the transfer of the Property to Purchaser after the Director is satisfied that (1) Purchaser has obtained all necessary financing commitments for the construction and permanent financing of the Project; and (2) other conditions in the Agreement are satisfied.

The term "Seller" shall mean the City only in its capacity as the seller under this Agreement.

 WHEREAS, the City obtained ownership of certain parcels known as the "Dearborn-Hiawatha Properties" from the State of Washington, Seattle Housing Authority, King County, and private owners; and

 WHEREAS, the City issued a competitive Request for Developer Qualifications/Proposals to solicit proposals for redevelopment of one or more Hiawatha parcels; and

 WHEREAS, in response to the Request for Developer Qualifications/Proposals, HomeSight submitted a proposal dated May 6, 2004 to acquire Dearborn-Hiawatha Parcels 2 A&B and construct a residential complex of condominium units; and

 WHEREAS, HomeSight is a not-for-profit corporation with a mission that includes developing affordable housing for the purpose of selling such housing to low and moderate income first time homebuyers; and

 WHEREAS, the Director of the City's Office of Housing determined that the HomeSight proposal was complete and responsive to the Request for Developer Qualifications / Proposals, and recommended that the Mayor and City Council authorize by ordinance an agreement for the transfer of ownership of Dearborn-Hiawatha Parcels 2 a & b to HomeSight or a designee approved by the Director; and

 WHEREAS, by Ordinance ________________ such authority has been granted;

 Now, therefore, the parties hereto, for and in consideration of the promises and mutual obligations herein undertaken, do hereby agree as follows:

 PART I

 Section 1. Agreement to Convey Property

 Subject to all of the terms and conditions of this Agreement, the City agrees to sell and convey to Purchaser, and Purchaser agrees to buy from the City, that certain real property located at 843 Hiawatha Place S. in the City of Seattle, commonly known as Parcels 2 A&B of the Dearborn / Hiawatha Properties, and legally described on the attached Exhibit A (the "Property"), and generally located as shown on the map attached hereto as Exhibit B. Such map is attached solely for convenience of reference and does not qualify in any way the description of the Property, nor constitute or evidence any representation or warranty of any kind as to the Property dimensions or boundaries, or any other information shown thereon, it being the intent of the parties that the Purchaser assumes the risk of any discrepancies or inaccuracies in such map.

 Section 2. Payment of Purchase Price; Conveyance

 2.01 Price and Form of Payment.

 Purchaser agrees to pay to the City the sum of One million, Forty Six Thousand Dollars ($1,046,000) (the "Purchase Price") for the Property, subject to the provisions in Section 2.04 below. The Purchase Price is payable as follows: Thirty-three Thousand, Eight Hundred Dollars ($33,800) at Closing (defined in Section 7 below) in cash, by wire transfer, or by cashier's check; and the balance pursuant to the terms of a promissory note in the form attached hereto as Exhibit C ("Note").

 Purchaser acknowledges that the purchase price was reduced due to major infrastructure work required to construct Improvements on the Property. The infrastructure work is outlined in the Schematic Design and Summary Description attached as Exhibit E and Purchaser commits to complete that infrastructure work at its sole expense.

 2.02 Conveyance

 Upon (i) the payment of the cash required at Closing under this Section 2 and all other amounts required to be paid by Purchaser at Closing hereunder, and (ii) the satisfaction of the conditions set forth in this Agreement, the City shall convey the Property, by Quitclaim Deed in the form attached hereto as Exhibit D (the "Deed"), which is hereby approved as to form by Purchaser. The parties acknowledge that to complete the development of the Project, the Purchaser intends to convey the Property to a limited liability company or limited partnership controlled by Purchaser ("Company"). If

 (1) the Purchaser is otherwise in full compliance with the terms of this Contract;

 (2) the Seller receives such title insurance or endorsements thereto as the Seller may require,

 then the Seller shall permit the conveyance of the Property to the Company, provided that the Company assumes all obligations of the Purchaser hereunder and subject to the prior satisfaction of any of the conditions of Section 5 below that the Seller shall have waived for purposes of Closing. Upon satisfaction of the conditions to permit such conveyance, Seller shall subordinate its lien to the liens and covenants reasonably required for the Company's financing of the development of the Property as contemplated in this Contract with the sole exception of liens in favor of Purchaser or its affiliates.

 (b) Any obligation of the Seller to grant any subordination hereunder is conditioned upon the delivery to Seller, at least 30 days in advance of the date when Purchaser desires a subordination agreement to be delivered, of the proposed form of subordination agreement and all documents related to the liens or encumbrances to which subordination is requested, as well as documents demonstrating to the satisfaction of the Seller that the conditions to subordination are satisfied or will be satisfied as of the date of deliver and recording of the subordination agreement. In addition, any subordination may be conditioned upon such changes to the form of subordination agreement as the Seller may require, and the issuance to the Seller of one or more endorsements to the Seller's title insurance policy, as the Seller may require.

 2.03 Security for Note; Partial Releases

 The Note shall be secured by a deed of trust, assignment of rents, security agreement and fixture filing in favor of the City, in form and content acceptable to seller, which shall be delivered at Closing and shall initially be a first lien on the Property.

 If the Project shall be completed and the Purchaser shall be in compliance with the terms of this Agreement, then the Seller shall provide to Purchaser a partial release of the Deed of Trust as to each unit sold, without payment of any amount on the Note, but only if (A) after the sale the Purchaser shall have remaining available for sale in compliance with Section 3.02 sufficient units to be sold as Long-Term Affordable Units, and (B) after the sale the Purchaser shall have remaining available for sale in compliance with Section 3.02 sufficient units to be sold so that at least 51% of the dwelling units in the Property shall have been initially occupied by buyers that are low-income households, as defined in Section 3.02 below and documented to the satisfaction of the Seller. Purchaser shall provide documentation showing that the conditions to a partial reconveyance are satisfied, together with the form of request for partial reconveyance acceptable to Seller, to the Seller at least Ten (10) days before the scheduled closing of any unit sale. Purchaser shall pay any reconveyance fees and recording costs.

 2.04 Satisfaction of Note Without Payment, Through Sales of Long- Term Affordable Units to Eligible Buyers

 If Purchaser shall be in full compliance with the terms of this Agreement, then upon each sale of a Long-Term Affordable Unit to a low-income household (as defined in Section 3.02 below) that occupies that unit, if the sale is on terms consistent with this Agreement, and the unit is made subject to recorded Affordability Covenant, an amount equal to 5%, or adjusted if more than 20 Long-Term Affordable Units are provided, of the original face amount of the Note shall be deemed paid, together with all accrued interest on that portion of the principal amount of the Note, until all amounts owing on the Note shall have been deemed paid hereunder.

 Section 3. Low-Income Housing

 3.01 Purpose of Sale

 The intent of this sale is to enable the Purchaser promptly to construct a building and related improvements on the Property containing for-sale units, consistent with this Contract and according to the Schematic Design and Summary Description attached as Exhibit E, with any modifications hereafter approved in writing by the Seller (the "Improvements"). The Improvements on the Property are to include housing for low-income households at least to the extent set forth below.

 3.02 Units for Low-Income Households

 (a) At least 51% of the dwelling units in the Property shall be affordable to, and initially occupied by, buyers who are low-income households.

 (b) At least 20 of the dwelling units in the Property meeting the requirements of section 3.02(a) above shall remain affordable to low- income

 households upon resale for at least thirty (30) years from the closing date of the first sale for each of the units (long-term affordable units). The Purchaser shall designate at least 20 dwelling units in the Property to satisfy this subsection (b), in each case on or before the date of closing of the initial sale of the unit. Each unit so designated is referred to as a "Long-Term Affordable Unit" and, after the date of initial sale of such unit, shall be subject to a recorded covenant acceptable to the Director, which shall have priority over any lien except for a first mortgage from the home buyer to a financial institution. Specific resale restrictions shall be determined prior to Property conveyance as set forth in Section 5.

 If in the unlikely event there is insufficient buyer demand for the Long-Term Affordable Units, Seller agrees to discuss status with Purchaser and consider options for those units, including but not limited to allowing rental occupancy until such time that homebuyer demand exists for those units. Rental terms shall be similar to City Rental Program requirements in existence at that time; specific proposed terms must be approved by the City prior to rental occupancy---such approval will not be unreasonably withheld.

 (c) Low-income buyers shall be required to provide no more than 5% of the sales price from their own funds.

 (d) For purposes of this Agreement:

 (1) A "low-income household" is a household with annual income, at the time of loan closing of a housing unit, at or below 80% of the Median Income.

 (2) "Median income" means annual median family income, as published from time to time by HUD, for the Seattle-Bellevue-Everett Primary Metropolitan Statistical Area, or for the Seattle-Bellevue-Everett Division of the Seattle-Tacoma-Bellevue Metropolitan Statistical Area, whichever is then generally used by HUD to establish income limits for federal programs, or such other area including Seattle as HUD may use from time to time for the purpose of publishing median income, and as adjusted for household size according to the method used by HUD for income limits in subsidized housing. If, at any time, Median Income for a household size cannot be determined under the foregoing sentence based on data published by HUD for the Seattle area within the most recent thirteen months, then the City may determine "Median Income" for such household size based on any data for the Seattle area or an area including Seattle, published or reported by a federal, state, or local agency, as the City shall select in its sole discretion, adjusted for household size in such manner as the City shall determine in its sole discretion.

 (3) A unit is considered "affordable" to a low-income household if housing costs do not exceed 35% of household income. For purposes of this definition, "housing costs" include mortgage principal and interest, taxes, insurance, homeowner association dues and/or assessments.

 Section 4. Title Insurance

 The City shall at its expense provide Purchaser with an ALTA Standard Coverage Owner's policy of title insurance, issued by Pacific Northwest Title Company of Washington, Inc. ("Title Company") in the amount of the Purchase Price of the Property, insuring Purchaser as the sole fee title holder as to the Property.

 Purchaser has reviewed a preliminary title commitment from (individually and collectively, the "Title Commitment") from Pacific Northwest Title Company of Washington, Inc, Order no. ___________, dated ____________, 2006, as supplemented through supplement no. ____ dated _____________, 2006 (as so supplemented, the "Title Commitment"), along with all documents referenced in the Title Commitment. Any claims, liens, encumbrances and defects (collectively, "Permitted Exceptions") shown thereon are hereby approved and accepted by Purchaser, except for exceptions __________________ regarding _________________________. The items so approved are the "Permitted Exceptions." Prior to the date of Closing, the City shall not further encumber the Property, or permit additional encumbrances to attach to the Property, without the express written consent of Purchaser. If title to the Property is not insurable under a standard owner's policy on the date fixed for Closing free and clear of all liens, except for the Permitted Exceptions and any that may be created or suffered by Purchaser, then unless the Purchaser elects to accept the liens or the parties, by mutual written agreement, extend the date for Closing to allow the City or the Purchaser, to remove such liens, this Agreement shall immediately terminate, in which case the City shall return the Earnest Money to Purchaser, and neither party shall have any further liability or obligation, of any kind whatsoever, to the other under this Agreement (except pursuant to indemnity provisions, which survive termination of this Agreement).

 Purchaser may obtain such additional title insurance coverage as Purchaser chooses, as long as Purchaser pays any difference in the cost between the standard coverage policy provided by the City and the increased premium due from any increase in coverage.

 Section 5. Conditions Precedent

 A. The following shall be conditions precedent to the City's obligation to convey the Property:

 1.

The Long-Term Affordable Units proposed shall reflect a variety of unit sizes (number of bedrooms).

 5. Purchaser shall have provided a final proposal acceptable to the Director for use of City homebuyer program assistance funding, if needed, to help maintain the affordability of the Long-Term Affordable Units, acceptable to the Director. That proposal shall reflect an agreement between Seller and Purchaser as to funding needed to help initial buyers afford homes as well as future use of funds repaid to HomeSight to help future buyers afford homes in the Property. The proposal shall provide for periodic review by Purchaser and Seller of funding status to determine if adjustments are needed to help maintain affordability or changes are needed to the affordability requirement.

 6. Purchaser shall have provided a final Affordability Covenant ("Covenant"), containing resale restrictions acceptable to the Director, to be recorded against the Long-Term Affordable Units.

 7. Purchaser shall have deposited with Pacific Northwest Title Company of Washington, Inc. or another escrow agent mutually agreed to in writing by the parties (the "Escrow Agent") for delivery to the City, the sum of money required to pay the cash portion of the Purchase Price of the Property as stated under Section 2 of this Agreement and all other amounts payable by Purchaser hereunder in cash or cashiers check or by wire transfer.

 8. Purchaser's representations contained herein shall be true as of the Closing of the Property.

 9. Purchaser shall have executed and delivered the Note and Deed of Trust.

 10. Purchaser shall otherwise be in compliance with all of the terms hereof.

 The foregoing conditions are solely for the benefit of the City and may be waived at the City's sole option, but no waiver shall be valid unless signed by an authorized officer of the City. Unless all of the above conditions are satisfied or waived on or before the date set forth in Section 7.B below, the City shall have no obligation to convey the Property.

 B. The following shall be conditions precedent to Purchaser's obligation to purchase the Property:

 1. The City shall have deposited with the Escrow Agent the Deed and a properly completed and signed real estate excise tax affidavit.

 2. The City shall have conducted all applicable environmental reviews to satisfy HUD requirements and either a Finding of No Significant Impact shall have been issued and approved by HUD, or a Final Environmental Impact Statement shall have been issued and the City shall have determined to proceed with this Agreement after evaluation of the environmental impacts.

 3. At Closing, title to the Property shall be insurable free and clear of all liens except for the Permitted Exceptions and any others created by Purchaser.

 4. The City's representations contained herein relating to the Property shall be true as of Closing.

 5. The City shall otherwise be in compliance with all of the terms hereof.

 Section 6. Earnest Money

 Immediately upon execution of this Agreement, Purchaser shall deposit with the City the amount of Five Thousand and 00/100 Dollars ($5,000.00), which shall be hereinafter referred to as the Earnest Money. The Earnest Money shall be held in the City Finance Department's Guarantee Deposit Trust Account until such time as the Purchaser becomes entitled to return of such Earnest Money under the terms hereof, or until the City becomes entitled to retain such Earnest Money under the provisions of this Agreement. Earnest Money shall be credited to the Purchase Price at Closing. Purchaser shall not be entitled to any interest on the Earnest Money. The City shall be entitled to retain any interest it may earn on the Earnest Money.

 Section 7. Closing; Effect of Failure to Close

 A. "Closing" shall mean the execution, delivery and recording (as appropriate) of all documents and payment of all funds into escrow as provided herein.

 B. Closing shall take place on such date as the Purchaser shall specify in a written notice to the City, which written notice (i) shall be delivered to the City at least ten (10) days in advance of the Closing Date specified in such written notice, and (ii) may be given at any time within, but not later than forty five (45) days after all conditions required herein to be satisfied prior to Closing, other than deposit of funds and instructions in escrow, have been satisfied, but in any event Closing shall occur no later than _______________________________________ (insert date 24 months after effective date of authorizing ordinance). Purchaser may request a Six (6) months closing extension, subject to the written approval of the Director, and other extensions which may be approved at the sole discretion of the Director, provided the Purchaser has demonstrated a good faith effort in proceeding toward Closing in a timely manner. If Closing does not occur by the date stated above, as it may be extended with the written approval of the Director, then this Agreement shall terminate automatically without notice.

 C. At least five (5) days in advance of the date fixed for Closing the Purchaser shall deliver to the City an original of the Deed, in the form attached as Exhibit D but with exhibit designations removed, signed by the Purchaser to evidence Purchaser's approval of the form thereof and Purchaser's agreement to the covenants therein. At least two (2) days in advance of the date fixed for Closing, the City and Purchaser shall each deliver to the Escrow Agent for deposit into escrow, all of the documents required by this Agreement as conditions to Closing, bearing all the original signatures called for therein, together with reasonable escrow instructions.

Purchaser shall pay the cost of recording the deed, and any documents required by Purchaser's financing.

 If the sale fails to close due to fault of one of the parties, as described in Sections 702 and 703 of Part III of this Agreement, then such party shall be solely responsible for all escrow and title insurance cancellation charges. If the sale fails to close by the date set forth in subsection B above, including allowable extension(s), for reasons other than those set forth in Sections 702 or 703, then the Earnest Money shall be returned to Purchaser, and the Purchaser shall pay directly to the escrow agent one half of any escrow fees and title insurance cancellation charges and the City shall pay one-half from the City's own funds. In that case neither party shall have any further liability or obligation, of any kind whatsoever, to the other under this Agreement (except pursuant to indemnity provisions, which survive termination of this Agreement).

The provisions of this Section shall not be construed to limit in any way the scope of the release, covenants and indemnity obligations to be granted and assumed by the Purchaser under the Deed.

 Purchaser and City by the initials below acknowledge that this Section has been specifically bargained for and that City would not be willing to sell the Property on the terms and conditions set forth in the rest of this Agreement without Purchaser's agreement to this Section.

 Purchaser:_______ City:_________

 Section 202. Changes in Condition

 1. Purchaser has inspected the Property in its present condition as of the date of this Agreement and such inspection has not disclosed any physical condition that would materially impair the development thereof as contemplated hereunder.

 2. If prior to Closing Purchaser or the City becomes aware of any change in the physical condition of the Property or any portion thereof after the date of this Agreement, or if there shall be discovered material Hazardous Substances on the Property not previously disclosed by Seller, in each case that would materially impair the feasibility of the project as contemplated hereunder or would substantially increase the hard construction costs of the Improvements (a "Changed Condition"), such party shall within ten (10) days of becoming aware of such Changed Condition, and in any event prior to Closing, notify the other party in writing of such Changed Condition.

 a) If the Changed Condition is caused by Purchaser or its agents, employees or contractors, Purchaser shall have the option to either restore the Property to its prior condition, complete its purchase of the Property hereunder, or both.

 b) If the Changed Condition is caused by the City or its agents, employees or contractors, the City shall at its discretion (i) restore the Property to its prior condition and reimburse Purchaser for Purchaser's damages caused by the Changed Condition or the City's restoration of the Property, or (ii) terminate this Agreement by written notice to Purchaser and return the Earnest Money.

 c) If neither Purchaser nor the City is responsible for the Changed Condition, then (i) if, within fifteen (15) days after the City sends or receives written notice of the Changed Condition, the City gives written notice to Purchaser that the City elects to remedy the Changed Condition, then this Agreement shall remain in effect and the City shall remedy the Changed Condition prior to Closing, or (ii) if the City does not give written notice of such election within said fifteen (15) days, then Purchaser shall have the option, by written notice to the City no later than fifteen (15) days after sending or receiving notice of the Changed Condition, either (A) to terminate this Agreement, in which case the City shall return the Earnest Money and neither party shall have any further obligation or liability to the other under this agreement (except pursuant to indemnity provisions, which survive termination of this Agreement), or (B) to assume the risk of the Changed Condition and complete the purchase of the Property.

 3. Any written notice from Purchaser to the City hereunder that Purchaser is prepared to close the purchase of the Property shall constitute Purchaser's representation that it has re-inspected the Property and Purchaser's agreement to accept it in its condition on the date of such notice, whether or not such condition has changed from the date hereof.

 4. Together with any notice required under this paragraph, each party shall, to the extent they have not already done so, provide the other party with a copy of any reports or findings in its possession or control that disclose the Changed Condition or describe how such Changed Condition would in fact materially impair the development of the Property as contemplated hereunder, or would substantially increase the cost of such development.

 Section 203. Possession

 As between City and Purchaser, Purchaser's right to possession of the Property (subject to any rights of the City reserved in the Deed) shall be effective upon recording of the Deed.

 Section 204. Licenses for Entry

 At any time and from time to time prior to Closing and prior to any termination of this Agreement, the Purchaser may request access for Purchaser's employees, agents and contractors to the Property, for the purpose of conducting therein and thereon such inspections and studies as Purchaser may reasonably deem necessary or appropriate with respect to evaluating its condition and designing the Improvements. Purchaser shall make any such request in writing at least 10 days prior to the first date when it desires such access and shall state the specific purposes for entry on the Property, the names of any agents or contractors involved, and the nature of any tests or other activities intended. The City will not unreasonably withhold or delay consent to such entry for purposes within the scope of this Section, provided that Purchaser, and its agents or contractors if applicable, agrees in writing to terms and conditions substantially as contained in the form of Permit attached as Exhibit F. Any such Permit shall state a limited period during which entry is authorized and the specific purposes for which entry is permitted. The covenants, releases and indemnities of Purchaser and any such other person in such Permit(s) shall be in addition to, and not in substitution for, the covenants, waivers and indemnities hereunder, and shall survive the Closing or termination of this Agreement.

 Section 205. Indemnification.

 Purchaser hereby agrees to release and forever discharge, indemnify, defend and hold the City, and its elected officials, employees and agents, harmless from and against any and all liability, including without limitation any claims, liability, costs, damages or fees (including but not limited to reasonable attorneys' fees and costs) incurred as a result of or in connection with Purchaser's entry onto any portion of the Property owned by the City, and including but not limited to Purchaser's release of any Hazardous Substances thereon, but only to the extent such liability does not arise from the actions of the City.

 The term "Hazardous Substances" shall mean any and all hazardous, toxic, infectious or radioactive substances, wastes or materials as defined or listed by any federal, state or local statute, regulation or ordinance pertaining to the protection of human health or the environment and shall specifically include petroleum oil and its fractions.

 SUBPART 300 - PLANS, APPROVALS, FINANCING AND CONSTRUCTION

 Section 301. Community Meetings on Design

 If so requested by the Director, Purchaser agrees to periodically provide progress reports to the community and attend at least one community meeting, in addition to any meetings required by the MUP/Design Review process, to present the architectural design and hear comments from neighboring residents and businesses, which comments shall not be binding upon Purchaser or require Purchaser to amend the design or other documents relating to the Improvements.

 Section 302. Schematic Design, Approval of Schematic Design by the Director

 Purchaser has prepared and the Director has approved plans and drawings, attached hereto as part of Exhibit E (collectively, the "Schematic Design") in sufficient detail with respect to development of the Property to describe the site plan, location of the Improvements, massing and height, site circulation, and relationship to the surrounding environment of the Improvements.

 Section 303. Construction Documents

 Purchaser shall prepare plans and specifications with respect to the construction of the Improvements (the "Construction Documents") substantially consistent with the approved Schematic Design and all applicable state and local laws and regulations. The Construction Documents shall be sufficiently complete and detailed to satisfy requirements pertinent to application for a building permit to DPD but also to demonstrate to the Director that the Improvements will be in accordance with the previously approved Schematic Design and Summary Description.

 Purchaser shall submit one set of the Construction Documents, together with a construction or progress schedule, to the Director at the same time as Purchaser submits the Construction Documents to DPD for the purpose of obtaining a building permit.

 Section 304. Changes in Schematic Design or Construction Documents

 The Director shall review the Construction Documents solely for the purpose of determining whether they substantially conform to the Schematic Design and Summary Description. The Director shall have ten (10) business days after receipt of the Construction Documents to notify the Purchaser in writing of any objections to the design as shown in the Construction Documents. Such written notice shall contain a statement of the specific reasons for such objection. Purchaser may within thirty (30) days after receiving Director's written notice of objection, submit a revision of the proposed changes, which shall be subject to the timely review described in Section 306 of this Agreement, unless the revisions are manifestly inconsistent in material respects with the approved Schematic Design or Summary Description. If in the Director's judgment the revised proposed changes satisfy the Director's objections stated in the Director's prior written notice of rejection or otherwise satisfy the criteria set forth above, the Director shall approve the revised proposed changes and evidence her approval by endorsement of the same on the revised plan sheets and by notifying the Purchaser in writing.

 If the revised proposed changes do not satisfy the Director's written objections or the criteria set forth above, the Director may reject the revised proposed changes and the City may terminate this Agreement by written notice to Purchaser and the Escrow Agent, in which case the Earnest Money shall be returned to the Purchaser. Neither party shall have any further liability or obligation, of any kind whatsoever, to the other under this Agreement (except pursuant to indemnity provisions, which survive termination of this Agreement).

 Section 305. Permits

 As a condition precedent to the City's obligation to sell the Property to the Purchaser, a Master Use Permit for the development of the Property consistent with the Schematic Design (as the same may have been modified with the consent of the City hereunder) and at a minimum the grading permit needed to commence construction of the Improvements must have been issued by DPD, or DPD must have given notice that such permits are ready to issue.

 The City acknowledges that the redevelopment of the Property and the requirements of this Agreement necessitate that Purchaser apply for and obtain certain permits and other similar authorizations (collectively, the "Permits") from the City and other governmental agencies relating to the Property and the Improvements prior to Purchaser obtaining fee title to the Property. The term "Permits" shall include without limitation use permits; building permits; short plats and lot boundary adjustments and other similar authorizations and approvals; grading permits; shoring permits; permits for work in public rights-of-way; and utility permits.

 Nothing in this Agreement is intended or shall be construed to require that the City exercise its discretionary authority under its regulatory ordinances to further the development of the Property, nor binds the City to do so. The City will process applications for Permits as if such applications were made in the absence of this Agreement. Purchaser assumes the risk of inability to obtain any such approvals, consents, or permits, for any reason. No consent, approval or requirement contained in or made by the Director of Housing or her designees pursuant to this Agreement shall constitute the approval, consent, or Permit required for any regulatory or other City purpose, nor require the City to grant any such approval, consent, or Permit. No regulatory requirement, condition or recommendation related to any Permit shall constitute approval for any change in the Schematic Design or for any Construction Plans or changes therein, nor obligate the Director of Housing to grant any such approval. The Director will not unreasonably withhold approval of changes to the Schematic Design necessitated by the MUP/Design Review process.

 Section 306. Timely Review of Changes in Design or Plans

 If, with respect to any transmittal or submission of any changes to the Schematic Design or Construction Documents, the Director does not give Purchaser written notice of her objection thereto and reasons therefore within ten (10) business days of receiving such documents, then if the first page of the transmittal conspicuously stated the effect of this Section with express reference hereto, the documents as transmitted to the Director shall be deemed approved.

 Section 307. Financing Commitment

 Purchaser represents that Purchaser will use its best efforts to obtain a financing commitment ("Financing Commitment") from one or more lending entities (individually and collectively, the "Lender(s)") to finance the construction of the Improvements to be built on the Property.

 As a condition precedent to the City's obligations hereunder, Purchaser shall provide to the Office of Housing financing commitments from the Lender(s), that demonstrate to the reasonable satisfaction of the Director that Purchaser will obtain all financing necessary to complete the Improvements in accordance with this Agreement, the Schematic Design, the Summary Description and the Construction Documents, and that no term of any Financing Commitment is in material conflict with the terms of this Agreement, the Schematic Design, the Summary Description or the Construction Documents.

 PART III - GENERAL

 SUBPART 400 - REGULATORY CONDITIONS

 Section 401. Non-Discrimination; Fair Contracting Practices

 The Purchaser shall not create barriers to open and fair opportunities for women and minority-owned businesses ("WMBEs ") to participate in contracts and to obtain or compete for contracts and subcontracts as sources of supplies, equipment, construction and services related to the development of the Property. In considering offers from and doing business with contractors and suppliers, the Purchaser shall not discriminate on the basis of race, color, creed, religion, sex, age, nationality, marital status, sexual orientation or the presence of any mental or physical disability in an otherwise qualified disabled person.

 Each party is required to comply with the Fair Contracting Practices Ordinance of the City of Seattle (Ordinance 119601), as amended. Conduct made unlawful by that ordinance constitutes a breach of contract. Engaging in an unfair contracting practice may also result in the imposition of a civil fine or forfeiture under the Seattle Criminal Code as well as various civil remedies.

 SUBPART 500 - PURPOSE OF PURCHASE; PROHIBITIONS AGAINST ASSIGNMENT AND TRANSFER

 Section 501. Improvements

 Purchaser represents and agrees that the purchase of the Property is for the purpose of immediate development of a residential complex consistent with the Schematic Design and Summary Description and not for speculation in land holding.

 Section 502. Transfer of Property and Assignment of Agreement

 Prior to Closing, except as specified in Section 2.02, Purchaser shall not transfer this Agreement or any interest herein without the express written consent of the City, and the City shall not be required to recognize any rights of any assignee to which it has not given express written consent.

 After Closing, Purchaser shall not transfer title to all or any part of the Property without the advance written consent of the City, except for sales of condominium units consistent with this Agreement, until all requirements of Section 3.02 regarding initial sales of units shall have been satisfied.

 SUBPART 700 - DEFAULT AND REMEDIES

 Section 701. Default

 Except as otherwise provided in this Agreement, in the event of any default under or breach of this Agreement, or any of its terms or conditions, by any party hereto, or any successor to a party, such party (or successor) shall, upon written notice from the other, proceed immediately to cure or remedy such default or breach, and, in any event, shall complete such cure within sixty (60) days after receipt of such notice or such shorter period as may be provided herein. In case such action is not taken or not diligently pursued, or the default or breach shall not be cured or remedied within the time permitted hereunder, the aggrieved party may pursue any remedies available at law or in equity, subject to the specific limitations herein. This Section shall not affect the operation of Section 702 or 703 below, nor require any notice or opportunity to cure prior to exercise of remedies under those Sections.

 Section 702. Remedies Upon Default of City before Closing

 Except as otherwise provided in this Agreement, in the event that any of the following occurs:

 a) The City fails to tender conveyance of the Property or otherwise close the sale of the Property in the manner required herein after satisfaction of the conditions provided in this Agreement and receipt of a notice to close from Purchaser as specified herein, and any such failure shall not be cured within sixty (60) days after notice from the Purchaser; or

 b) The Director of the Office of Housing fails or refuses to approve of Purchaser's Construction Documents pursuant to the terms of this Agreement without providing a written explanation for such refusal, and such failure or refusal is not cured within sixty (60) days after written notice thereof; or

 c) The City otherwise fails or refuses to comply with the terms and conditions of or is in default or breach of this Agreement prior to Closing, and does not cure such breach within sixty (60) days after written notice thereof, then at the option of Purchaser this Agreement shall be terminated, upon written notice to the City of such termination, the City shall surrender the Earnest Money to the Purchaser and Purchaser shall have the right, as its sole remedy, to proceed against the City for actual damages, limited to out-of-pocket costs directly related to development of the Property. Such termination, recovery of Earnest Money and proceeding for such damages shall be Purchaser's only remedies for breach or default by the City at or prior to Closing. As used herein, the term "out-of- pocket costs" excludes administrative or overhead costs, legal fees to the extent not incurred as part of the financing and development of the project, and also excludes consequential damages of any kind whatsoever, such as but without limitation lost profits, lost business opportunities or interference with business or contractual expectancies.

 Section 703. Remedies Upon Default of Purchaser before Closing

 Except as otherwise provided in this Agreement, in the event that prior to the conveyance of the Property to Purchaser, any of the following occurs:

 (a) Purchaser (or any successor in interest) assigns or attempts to assign this Agreement or any rights therein or in the Property without the express written consent of the Seller; or

 (b) Purchaser does not submit Construction Documents acceptable to the Director as required by this Agreement or does not obtain the permits necessary to allow construction, in each case, in the manner and by the dates respectively provided in this Agreement; or

 (d) Purchaser, without legal excuse, does not tender the full consideration for and take title to the Property and perform all other obligations of Purchaser at Closing of the Property on or before Noon on the date set for closing; or

 (e) Purchaser, without legal excuse, otherwise fails to comply with the terms of or is in default or breach of this Agreement prior to Closing and does not cure such breach within sixty (60) days after written notice thereof, then at the option of the City this Agreement and any rights of Purchaser or of any assignee or transferee in this Agreement or arising therefrom with respect to the City or the Property shall be terminated upon receipt by Purchaser of written notice of such termination, and the Earnest Money shall be retained by the City. The Earnest Money is intended as liquidated damages and not as a penalty, and in case of termination under this Section retention of the Earnest Money shall be City's sole and exclusive remedy, and if the Purchaser's rights shall be terminated under this Section neither party shall have any further liability or obligation, of any kind whatsoever, to the other under this Agreement (except pursuant to indemnity provisions, which survive termination of this Agreement).

 Section 704. Other Rights and Remedies; No Waiver of Delay

 Either party shall have the right to institute such actions or proceedings as it may deem desirable for effectuating its remedies, subject to express limits herein. Any delay by either party in instituting or prosecuting any such actions or proceedings or otherwise asserting its rights under this Agreement shall not operate as a waiver of any rights or remedies or to deprive it of or limit such rights or remedies in any way; nor shall any waiver in fact and in writing made with respect to any specific default be considered or treated as a waiver of the rights or remedies of either party with respect to any other defaults or with respect to the particular default except to the extent specifically waived in writing.

 Pursuant to Seattle Ordinance ___________, this deed is made subject to, and the Grantor reserves the rights and interests of The City of Seattle set forth in, that certain Covenant for Low-Income Housing granted by Grantee dated as of the date hereof and recorded on the date of recording hereof, which is incorporated herein by this reference.

 Grantee's Covenants, Releases and Indemnity ("Covenant")

 The Property is conveyed AS-IS, WHERE-IS, WITH-ALL-FAULTS, AND WITHOUT ANY REPRESENTATION OR WARRANTY WHATSOEVER, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, AS TO ITS CONDITION, ENVIRONMENTAL OR OTHERWISE, OR ITS SUITABILITY OR SUFFICIENCY FOR THE GRANTEE'S INTENDED USES AND PURPOSES. Grantee acknowledges that adverse physical, economic or other conditions (including without limitation, adverse environmental soils and ground-water conditions), either latent or patent, may exist on the Property and assumes Grantor's responsibility for all environmental conditions of the Property, known or unknown, including but not limited to responsibility, if any, for investigation, removal or remediation actions relating to the presence, release or threatened release of any Hazardous Substance or other environmental contamination relating to the Property. Grantee also releases, covenants not to sue, and shall indemnify, defend, and hold Grantor and its past, present and future officials, employees, and agents, harmless from and against any and all claims, demands, penalties, fees, damages, losses, expenses (including but not limited to fees and costs of regulatory agencies, attorneys, contractors and consultants), and liabilities arising out of, or in any way connected with, the condition of the Property including but not limited to any alleged or actual past, present or future presence, release or threatened release of any Hazardous Substance in, on, under or emanating from the Property, or any portion thereof or improvement thereon, from any cause whatsoever; it being intended that Grantee shall so indemnify Grantor and such personnel without regard to any fault or responsibility of Grantor or Grantee. Grantee is aware of the rights it might otherwise have to seek recovery from Grantor for costs of remediation and cleanup of Hazardous Substances under applicable law, including without limitation the Washington Model Toxics Control Act ("MTCA") and the federal Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act ("CERCLA"), and Grantee hereby knowingly waives all such rights, now existing or hereafter arising, and voluntarily relinquishes those rights and forever releases the Grantor from any such obligation. The obligation to complete all environmental investigation, removal or remediation of the Property and the acknowledgements, releases, and covenants herein touch and concern the Property, are intended to run with the land and bind Grantee and Grantee's heirs, successors and assigns, and inure to the benefit of Grantor and its successors and assigns.

 For purposes of this Covenant, the term "Hazardous Substance" shall mean petroleum products and compounds containing them; flammable materials; radioactive materials; polychlorinated biphenyls ("PCBs") and compounds containing them; lead, asbestos or asbestos-containing materials in any friable form; underground or above-ground storage tanks; and any substance or material that is now is or hereafter becomes regulated under any federal, state, or local statute, ordinance, rule, regulation, or other law relating to environmental protection, contamination or cleanup.

 Grantee's release and covenant not to sue shall include both claims by Grantee as original plaintiff against Grantor and any cross- claims, third-party claims or other claims against Grantor by Grantee based upon claims made against Grantee by any third parties. The obligation to indemnify and defend shall include, but not be limited to, any liability of Grantor to any and all federal, state or local regulatory agencies or other persons or entities for remedial action costs and natural resources damages claims. This Covenant means that Grantee accepts the Property "as-is, where-is and with-all- faults," and that Grantee assumes all responsibility of Grantor to investigate, remove and remediate any environmental conditions on the Property and has no recourse against Grantor or any of its officers, employees or agents for any claim or liability with respect to the Property. This Covenant shall apply regardless of whether or not Grantee is culpable, negligent or in violation of any law, ordinance, rule or regulation. Nothing herein shall release, discharge or affect any rights or causes of action that Grantor or Grantee may have against any other person or entity, except as otherwise expressly stated herein, and each of the parties reserves all such rights including, but not limited to, claims for contribution or cost recovery relating to any Hazardous Substance in, on, under or emanating from the Property.

 Nondiscrimination. Grantee further covenants that there shall be no discrimination upon the basis of race, color, religion, sex, or national origin, in the sale, lease or rental, or in the use or occupancy, of the Property or any improvements erected or to be erected thereon. Both the Grantor and the United States of America shall be entitled to enforce this paragraph, which shall run with the land and bind Grantee and Grantee's heirs, successors and assigns.

 The terms of this Covenant are in addition to, and not in substitution for, those terms of the Purchase and Sale Agreement dated ______________, 2006 between Grantor and Grantee (the "Contract") that, by the terms of such Contract, survive the delivery of this deed.

 Condition Subsequent / Power of Termination. This conveyance is subject to the following condition and power of termination which shall be binding on the Grantee and its successors and assigns, and to which Grantee agrees on behalf of Grantee and its successors and assigns:

 1. Condition Subsequent. This Deed and all rights of Grantee hereunder are subject to a condition subsequent upon the occurrence of which Grantor or its governmental successors or assigns shall have the absolute right, subject only to the express limitations set forth herein, to terminate, by notice to Grantee or by reentering and taking possession of the Property, the estate conveyed under this deed and all rights of all persons claiming by or through Grantee, whereupon fee simple title to the Property shall revest entirely in Grantor or its governmental successors or assigns. The condition subsequent shall have occurred unless the following shall have occurred on or before December 31, 2008: Grantee shall have obtained from the Seattle Department of Planning and Development ("DPD") the Certificate of Occupancy for the Property consistent with the Schematic Design and Summary Description.

 2. Certificate of Compliance. Upon recording of a Certificate of Compliance duly signed by the Director of the Office of Housing of the Grantor, stating that the Grantee has timely satisfied the above requirement such that the condition subsequent cannot occur, or that if such requirements have not been timely satisfied they have been waived by the City, the condition subsequent in this deed shall be of no further force or effect.

 3. Miscellaneous. Capitalized terms not defined herein shall have the meanings set forth in the Contract. Time is of the essence of all of the provisions hereof.
