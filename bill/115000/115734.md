 WHEREAS, the Board of Park Commissioners was established in 1887 to oversee the administration and development of the Seattle park system; and

 WHEREAS, since 1968, Seattle has grown and become a major metropolitan city, known worldwide for its arts and culture, economic engines, environment and excellent quality of life; and

 WHEREAS, our Parks and Recreational system plays an integral role in contributing to the quality of life of our city's residents; and

 WHEREAS, Seattle residents care deeply about keeping parks and open spaces green, clean and accessible and have voted to tax themselves through the Pro Parks 2000 Levy ($198M) and the Community Centers and Seattle Center Levies of 1991 and 1999 ($121M); and

 WHEREAS, proceeds from these levies have been and are being used to develop parks and community centers, acquire open space and support environmental stewardship, enhanced maintenance and select recreational programs; and

 WHEREAS, the City Council expects that the city's population will continue to grow and the pressures upon our parks and recreational system will continue to increase as the city's density increases; and

 WHEREAS, the City Council further anticipates that major issues will need to be addressed, considered and deliberated including the expiration of the Pro Parks 2000 Levy, an overall Parks Strategic Plan, and a major maintenance plan; and

 WHEREAS, the City Council strives to make the best policy decisions with regard to our parks, open spaces and recreational programs in an open and transparent manner after carefully considering citizen input; and

 WHEREAS, the City Council acknowledges the important advisory role that boards and commissions play in receiving public input, weighing options and making recommendations with regard to policy decisions; and

 WHEREAS, the City Council believes it to be beneficial to the city that the membership of the City's boards and commissions represent a variety of perspectives and be reflective of our city's population; NOW, THEREFORE,
