 AN ORDINANCE relating to drainage services of Seattle Public Utilities; amending Seattle Municipal Code Section 21.33.030 to adjust drainage rates; and amending Seattle Municipal Code Section 21.76.040 to adjust credits to low-income drainage customers.

 WHEREAS, the rates for drainage services were last increased on January 1, 2004; and

 WHEREAS, Seattle Public Utilities ("SPU") has developed a Comprehensive Drainage Plan ("CDP") which recommends operating programs and capital projects to reduce flooding, improve water quality, improve drainage along many major arterials, and restore creek habitat; and

 WHEREAS, the cost to implement CDP-recommended programs and projects in 2005 and 2006 will result in increased annual expenses for debt service, capital cash financing and operations; and

 WHEREAS, the City has approved a significant bond issuance for 2004 to finance a portion of the drainage Capital Improvement Program ("CIP"), and this issuance will increase annual drainage expenses for debt service beginning in 2005; and

 WHEREAS, SPU anticipates, and the Council recognizes, that a significant bond issuance will be needed during 2005 to finance a portion of the drainage CIP and that this issuance will further increase annual drainage expenses for debt service beginning in 2006; and

 WHEREAS, SPU has completed a rate study showing that existing rates will not provide sufficient revenues to pay the costs of providing drainage services and that rate increases therefore are required; and

 WHEREAS, credits for qualified low-income customers need to be revised to reflect an increase in drainage rates; NOW, THEREFORE,

 BE IT ORDAINED BY THE CITY OF SEATTLE AS FOLLOWS:

 SPU shall provide a 10% reduction in drainage rates for properties containing new or remodeled commercial buildings that, after July 27, 2003, install and utilize rainwater harvesting systems that are sized to use or infiltrate the amount of rain that falls on the roofs of such buildings during a one year, 24 hour storm event. A system that involves indoor uses of rainwater must be permitted by Seattle-King

 County Department of Health in order to qualify for the rate reduction. A system that relies solely on the capture and indoor use of rainwater shall qualify for the drainage rate reduction only if the system is sized to meet the performance requirement. Qualifying for the drainage rate reduction does not relieve the property owner from the obligation to comply with applicable stormwater and drainage code

 requirements for the buildings and site.
